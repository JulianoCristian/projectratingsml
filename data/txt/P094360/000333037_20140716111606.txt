  Population based surveys were planned for baseline, mid-term and end of project. However, only the baseline survey
was conducted. The baseline survey is representative of the target population for 5 states from phase one only. There
are no comparable data for phase 2 districts and states. In the absence of mid-term and end of project surveys
aggregated population-weighted LQAS data from implementing districts in the 5 phase 1 states was reported. This data
is not representative of the target population of 11 states and the validity of the estimates is questionable.

I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Vector-borne diseases (VBD) pose immense public health concern and continue to be major
causes of significant morbidity and mortality in India. At the time of project preparation, over
90% of the reported 2 million malaria burden was predominately from 11 states in India, while
nearly all 40,000 new kala azar cases reported every year were from the states of Bihar,
Jharkhand and West Bengal.

The Government of India (GoI) made enormous progress in containing the VBD over more than
three decades. Between 1997/8 and 2007/8, the total expenditure on VBD control increased by
170%. The country’s National Health Policy (2002) has pledged commitment to reduce mortality
of malaria by 50% and eliminate kala azar by 2010.

In 2005, GOI launched the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), a flagship national program
to improve rural health outcomes. NRHM serves as an umbrella program that links together
disease control and other public health programs, including the National Vector Borne Disease
Control Programme (NVBDCP). NRHM incorporates a number of innovative approaches in the
sector, including a new national community health worker program, use of untied block grants,
district-level planning, and new initiatives aimed at community mobilization and accountability.
In 2010, this program became known as the National Health Mission, or NHM, as it incorporated
urban health.

Rational for Bank assistance

Vector Borne Diseases: At the time of appraisal, the World Bank had been assisting GOI in
developing effective infectious disease control programs for over a decade. A Malaria Control
Project, partially funded by the International Development Association (IDA), was implemented
in selected districts from 1997 to 2005. The project’s Implementation Completion Report
highlighted the need for major reform in the technical content of the malaria program as well as
of its implementation arrangements. Subsequently, the GOI developed new policies for vector
borne disease control incorporating the latest evidence based prevention, diagnostic and treatment
approaches for malaria and kala azar. The new Bank-financed project being assessed by this ICR,
was therefore an opportunity to translate these policies into practice by introducing new malaria
diagnosis and treatment strategies, long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) as an alternative to
indoor residual house spraying (IRS) with DDT, and new diagnostic technology and new drugs to
treat kala azar.

Polio: India joined the global polio eradication efforts in 1995 by starting the National
Immunization Days (NIDs) Program. Polio eradication efforts progressed well until they suffered
a set-back in 2002 with a major increase of polio cases in the state of Uttar Pradesh. This placed a
substantial operational challenge as well as financial burden on the country due to steeply
increasing operational and vaccine costs. Despite these set-backs, polio elimination remained
technically and politically feasible in India. In May 2008, the India Expert Advisory Group
(IEAG) for polio identified a substantial financing gap and expressed serious concerns about
vaccine security. With limited world production of polio vaccine, the lack of multi-year secured
financing made it difficult for the GOI to ensure adequate vaccine supplies. With India being one
of only four polio endemic countries left in the world (at the time of project preparation), the


                                                 1
Bank agreed to support India’s effort to eradicate polio through provision of financial security for
the multi-year purchase of polio vaccine, and expanded the project to include a polio component
(original estimated cost US$271 million).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The Project Development Objective (PDO) as stated in the PAD is “to enhance the effectiveness
of government response to control malaria, eliminate kala azar and eradicate polio. This will be
achieved by an increase in the number of people benefiting from effective prevention, diagnosis
and treatment services for malaria and kala azar, and vaccination against polio”.

The PDO in the Financing Agreement (FA) differs from the PAD: “to enhance the effectiveness
of Recipient’s efforts to control malaria, eliminate kala azar and eradicate polio, by: (a) increasing
the number of people benefiting from effective prevention, diagnosis and treatment services for
malaria and kala azar; (b) strengthening central and state capacities for evidence-based policy
development, strategic planning, and program management for effective control of vector-borne
diseases; and (c) securing the timely supply of polio vaccines”.

The disconnect between the two versions of the PDOs is that the FA includes an additional PDO
(b) which more adequately reflects the project design since Project Component 3 (see below), and
subcomponents 3a and 3b (but not 3c –M&E), deals with the strengthening of state capacities.
The FA PDO also clarifies that the project is concerned exclusively with the supply of polio
vaccine and not the process of immunization more broadly as may be implied in the PAD
definition.

The PDO key indicators are:

 For vector borne diseases:
(i)      Percentage of fever cases in project districts receiving a malaria test result no later than
the day after the first contact;
(ii)     Percentage of individuals in project areas belonging to eligible LLIN target population
who slept under an LLIN during the previous night.
(iii)    At least 50% of sampled blocks which at baseline have not achieved the elimination goal
of less than one kala azar case per 10,000 persons, will achieve the elimination goal by endline.

For polio:
(iv)    At least 80% of the households with eligible children covered during national and sub-
national immunization days in high risk districts.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The PDO was not revised during the life of the project despite the differences between the PDO
as articulated in the PAD and in the FA.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The project was meant to benefit tribal people and the rural poor who are disproportionately
affected by malaria and kala azar. By focusing on the geographic areas where malaria and kala
azar morbidity and mortality were the highest, the project also focused on the poorest, most



                                                  2
remote and disenfranchised populations in India. Both diseases have strong but complex links
with poverty, and the burden falls disproportionately on the poorest segments of the population.
Within endemic areas, increased infection risk is linked to poor housing conditions and
environmental sanitation, lack of personal protective measures and economically driven
migration.

Project beneficiaries also included all persons at risk of polio during the project (by definition
those living in the most remote and inaccessible communities) and future generations who, once
polio eradication was achieved, would never again be at risk from the disease.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The project had four components with a total estimated cost of US$521 million.

Component 1: Improving Access to and Use of Malaria Prevention and Control Services (total
estimated costs US$119.5 million)

This component was to finance centralized procurement of commodities and had three sub-
components: (a) improve malaria case management by supporting rapid scale up of evidence
based diagnosis and treatment polices; (b) strengthen malaria surveillance by supporting effective
passive surveillance; and (c) rapid scaling-up of Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs) and
promoting integrated vector management.

Component 2: Supporting Elimination of Kala Azar (US$41.9 million)

This component was to finance the procurement of commodities and had three sub-components:
(a) improve kala azar case management by supporting effective diagnostic and treatment services
and ensuring treatment compliance; (b) strengthen kala azar surveillance by using sentinel sites
complemented by active case search in locations where clustering of cases is noted; and (c)
ensure effective kala azar vector control through piloting integrated vector management and
supporting community mobilization. Given the concentration of kala azar geographically, forty-
six (46) of the most endemic districts in 3 states were targeted for intervention.

Component 3: Policy and Strategy Development, Capacity Building and Monitoring and
Evaluation (US$52.1 million).

This component of the project was designed to develop evidence based public health policies and
strategies, and strengthening program management capacity and M&E. It had three sub-
components, each with multiple associated activities as follows:

(a) Policy and Strategy Development, through: (i) updating policies for prevention, diagnosis and
treatment of vector-borne diseases based on evidence and the translation of these policies to
operational guidelines, training materials and courses; (ii) improving quality assurance of, inter-
alia, rapid diagnostic kits (RDKs) and microscopy; (iii) operations research including technology
assessment of, inter-alia, different pumps for indoor residual spraying (IRS), RDKs for vivax
malaria, and different delivery models in the private and public sectors; (iv) impact evaluation for
malaria control; (v) periodic external reviews of the program; (vi) monitoring of drug resistance
and insecticide effectiveness; (vii) assessment of quality of medicines; and (viii) the promotion
and establishment of public-private partnerships (PPPs) for the distribution of state and district
levels long-lasting insecticidal nets.


                                                 3
(b) Program Management and Capacity Building, through: (i) provision of additional state and
district level staff for procurement, financial management, BCC, and M&E; (ii) deployment of
additional entomologists at State levels; (iii) management training for state and district program
teams; (iv) integrated vector management training for supervisors and State entomologists; and
(v) training and exchange programs for national and state vector-borne disease control program
managers.

(c) Monitoring and Evaluation, through: (i) making the existing computerized management
information system (MIS) functional, and monitoring and evaluation-related surveys and studies;
and (ii) the strengthening of a geographic information system (GIS) for micro-stratification,
planning, monitoring and advocacy.

Contingency Fund for Vector Borne Disease Control (US$36.5 million)

In addition to the funds allocated above for Components 1 and 2, additional funds were included
in the project as unallocated to address unanticipated costs, such as more rapid scale up of project
interventions such as LLINs or in the event that proposed finances from the GFATM for malaria
control did not become available.

Component 4: Supply of polio vaccine (US$271 million)

The component was to finance the procurement of three types of oral polio vaccines required for
coverage of eligible children under supplemental national and sub-national polio immunization
rounds.

1.6 Revised Components

Project Components were not revised during the course of the project although their scope was
significantly reduced: 49.5% of the financing was cancelled by the end of project (see below).

1.7 Other significant changes

Although the focus of the project did not change in terms of number of diseases targeted (malaria,
kala azar and polio) and the concurrent focus on policy and strategy development, capacity
building and monitoring and evaluation, the scale of the project changed significantly over its life
due to delays linked to district readiness, HR recruitment and sub-contracting, financial
management and procurement. A total of three restructuring exercises were carried out, two of
which involved cancellation of a total US$258 million (49.5%) of the original US$521 million of
IDA financing. See section 2.2 below for a detailed explanation of each restructuring.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The project was the first centrally sponsored health operation following the Detailed
Implementation Review (DIR) 2007 and was in conformity with the actions agreed under the
Joint Action Plan between the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) and IDA.

Lessons incorporated into project design. Project preparation and design benefitted from the
documented experience and lessons learned from the World Bank financed Malaria Control


                                                 4
Project (MCP) which was implemented between October 1997 and December 2005 and the
findings and recommendations of the DIR. The following lessons were reflected in the project
design:

Project Phasing: The decision to implement the project in two phases was a design response to
the identified critical risk that the new malaria case management policy did not have well
established implementation models. The mitigation measure was to implement the project using
a phased implementation approach with expansion subject to early implementation reviews. The
districts included in phase 1 of the project were those with the greatest burden of malaria and kala
azar.

Technical Design. On a technical level, the project benefited from i) a close partnership with the
WHO and other partners (including CDC, BMGF, GFATM, UNICEF, etc.) and active
participation of Bank staff in the WHO-National Vector Borne Disease Control Program Joint
Monitoring Mission in February 2007 (JMM-2007); ii) direct engagement of Bank staff in health
sector dialogue broadly, and in discussions of policies and technical strategies for malaria control
and kala azar in particular; and (iii) opportunities to engage with and build on the approaches
(such as the national community health worker program, district level planning and new
initiatives aimed at community mobilization and accountability) promoted under the National
Rural Health Mission (NRMH) which was established in 2005. Ultimately, this led to the
development of a project that aimed to bring malaria control and kala azar elimination into the
21st century by emphasizing the roll out of new policies and the introduction of new tools,
technologies, service delivery and monitoring and evaluation strategies. Implementation of the
new technical strategies was dependent on two important assumptions: 1) the general health
services and a large cadre of village based volunteer providers would be able to effectively



                                                   5
deliver the services; and 2) there would be a consistent supply of quality assured pharmaceuticals,
test kits and LLINs.

Risk Assessment. As mentioned above, this project was the first health sector project in India to
be approved after the 2007 DIR of five health projects in the India portfolio. The India DIR
found significant indicators of fraudulent and corrupt practices in all five projects including, inter
alia, a high risk of fraud and corruption in decentralized procurement (local contracting), a
practice which was increasingly being used in Bank projects, but was subject to only minor
procurement review. Therefore, during the preparation of this project, both the Bank and the
Government of India were very concerned that steps be taken to ensure that risks of fraud and
corruption were properly mitigated in project design. The DIR and the associated MoHFW-IDA
Joint Action Plan had a significant impact on the design of the project, particularly with respect to
procurement, financial management and implementation arrangements, including ensuring
institutional strengthening arrangements at the central, state and district levels to address both
operational and fiduciary concerns and the introduction of district readiness filters for
decentralized funds. The DIR affected the way procurement was to be carried out under the
project. Specifically, fiduciary safeguards recommended by the DIR were put into place
including: (i) use the professional procurement agent for the procurement of goods at the central
level, and (ii) exclude decentralized procurement from Bank's financing (until demonstration that
the states had developed the necessary capacity).

Lengthy project preparation period. The project was prepared over an extended period(2005-
2009) during which the Bank and the GOI were able to identify opportunities to position the
project as a potential game changer with respect to the control of malaria and kala azar and an
important contributor to the final push towards the elimination of polio. The project preparation
period was prolonged in part by the need to conduct a Detailed Implementation Review (DIR) of
the earlier Malaria Control Project (MCP) and other health sector projects and the subsequent
development of agreements and measures to improve program governance and accountability in
Bank financed projects. The PAD was significantly revised on two occasions. Following the
Quality Enhancement Review (QER) on May 2, 2007, the scope of the project was narrowed
from support for all VBDs nationally to malaria control and kala azar elimination in a select
number of high burden states and district. The second major revision occurred during project
appraisal and negotiation. The project was appraised on June 6, and negotiated June 10, 2008.
Subsequent to negotiations, the Government of India requested that a component be added to the
project to finance the purchase of polio vaccines from UNICEF. The Bank accommodated the
request, added a polio component and US$271 million IDA financing, and renegotiated the
project on June 20, 2008. The project was approved on July 31, 2008 and became effective on
March 6, 2009 (see below the explanation for this effectiveness delay).

Benefit of project reviews: To ensure good quality at entry, the project went through several
reviews during the preparation phase including a QER in 2007 which helped to shape and focus
the project on malaria and kala azar (rather than vector borne diseases more broadly) and limit the
geographic scope to the districts with the highest endemicity for the two diseases. The project
was also submitted for an Operational Committee (OC) Review cum Appraisal Review Meeting
on May 28, 2008. In the OC review, the team specifically sought management guidance on
issues related to risk and their mitigation and the balance between residual risk post mitigation
and the potentially large benefits. The guidance from the OC review was incorporated into
project design.

2.2 Implementation



                                                  6
The project became effective in March 6, 2009. The delay in effectiveness was due to the time
required for obtaining GOI and parliamentary approvals, which took longer than expected due to
national elections during the period. The technical and policy guidance by the World Bank team
provided through the preparation and early implementation of the project, working closely with
WHO, the National Institute of Malaria Research and its field officers, the Ministry of Health and
Family Welfare (MoHFW) and the National Vector Borne Disease Control Program Directorate,
led to key policy changes that were long overdue in malaria prevention and control in India.
These changes include the adoption of Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs), and case
management at community level through the use of Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) and
Artemisinin Combination Therapy (ACTs) by community based volunteers.

Despite early progress with respect to policy and strategy development in the first two years, the
following implementation challenges were reported in Aide Memoire from the beginning of
project implementation throughout the life of the project: i) difficulty in recruitment and retention
of field consultants due to issues of pay parity of project staff with NRHM staff at all levels, ii)
delays in procurement of LLINs, pharmaceuticals and diagnostic kits, iii) delays in recruitment
and payments to consultants who submitted their deliverables, iv) lack of decentralized funds for
printing behavior change communication (BCC) materials, and v) limited use of monitoring data
for targeting efforts.

Mid Term Review (MTR) May 2-20, 2011

The MTR took place at a time when many of the issues confronted during the first two years of
the project, including delays in district readiness, completion of the baseline household survey,
recruitment of human resources, signature of consulting contracts and procurement of core
commodities had been, at least temporarily, resolved and project implementation/performance
was at its peak. . The MTR was conducted jointly with technical and development partners. The
methodology included data analysis, the review of state reports, thematic reviews and in-depth
field visits. The review concluded that there had been significant progress (with respect to prior
performance) across the board in the implementation of the project, and particularly on program
management, monitoring and evaluation, the social aspects and the implementation of the
environmental management plan. It was also noted that disbursement increased to 20%, all
delayed payments to suppliers under the project were being released, and all outstanding service
contracts had been placed. The MTR noted that at the time of the review: 1) the malaria control
program services were functioning in accordance with the national malaria control strategy. User
friendly RDTs and pre-packaged ACTs were available, the health staff and the Accredited Social
Health Activist (ASHA) were enabled to provide the diagnosis and treatment services, and there
were no reported stock outs of RDT or malaria drugs. There was however variability in
implementation progress across states with two of the phase one states, Jharkhand and
Chhattisgarh, lagging behind the others; 2) the kala azar effort was showing progress, but a more
vigorous effort was needed - especially in Bihar State, to overcome implementation constraints
including the absence of operational guidelines, poor quality and sub-optimal indoor residual
house spraying and stocks of obsolete drugs, and; 3) the procurement of oral polio vaccines under
the project continued to be smooth after amending the Financial Agreement to allow M/s RITES
to serve as procurement agent addition to UNICEF. The review also identified a large number of
challenges and associated actions. Cross cutting issues included: the recruitment, retention,
supervision and mobility of human resources and highlighted the problem of lack of pay parity;
problems associated with procurement, commodity logistics and contract management, including
technical specifications and prolonged delays in processing central procurement, and; financing
and financial management including problems associated with the standard costs approach to
decentralized financing, timely release of funds; delayed or non-payment of salaries to


                                                 7
consultants and lack of clarity on incentives for community level service providers (ASHA) and
patients. Following the MTR, the ratings for both environmental and social safeguards were
raised from “unsatisfactory” to “moderately satisfactory” and the overall IP rating was raised
from “moderately satisfactory” to “satisfactory”.

Project Restructuring

The project was restructured three times. None of the restructuring exercises resulted in a change
in the PDO, components, indicators or targets.

Level Two: Amendment to the FA for procurement of Oral Polio Vaccines. Approved on 16-Dec-
2010:

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) expressed concern over the perceived
high vaccine prices, as well as the high management fees charged, when OPVs were procured
through UNICEF. The GOI therefore requested that the Bank allow M/s RITES (the MoHFW
procurement agent) to undertake OPV procurement. The Bank agreed to allow M/s RITES (or
any other professional procurement agent selected per the Project procurement arrangements) to
undertake procurements of OPV, with the proviso that any such arrangement provide supply
security and flexibility to meet the program’s requirements and be consistent with the agreed
quality assurance (QA) standards *i.e., that they be WHO pre-qualified). The FA was amended to
allow payment to agencies other than UNICEF who could procure OPVs under the project.

Level two: Cancellation of US$158 million of IDA Credit. Approved on 19-Dec-2012:

Based on an assessment and recommendation by the Bank team, the GOI requested the
cancellation of US$184 million of IDA Credit. The amount cancelled was US$158 million which
was lower than the requested amount as the cancellation request did not take into account unpaid
liabilities for goods and services under the polio component of the Project. This included
cancellation of (a) US$70 million from the vector borne disease control components of the
project due to chronic delays in central procurement of commodities; and (b) US$88 million
from the polio component as the GOI elected to source polio vaccines from domestic suppliers
with GMP certification but who were not WHO pre-qualified.

Level Two: Cancellation of US$100 million. Approved on 31-Dec-2013

The GOI requested a cancellation of US$100 million IDA Credit (from the VBD components) of
the remaining Credit amount of US$101.4 million. The project had been slow to disburse under
the VBD components primarily due to delays in the central procurement of Long Lasting
Insecticidal Nets (LLINs) and some other key diagnostic and treatment related commodities.
Since the project was scheduled to close on December 31, 2013, it was unlikely that these
procurements would be completed in time even if a rebidding process using the existing
government system were to be initiated. Prior to the request for cancellation, the GOI had
requested an extension of the project which was not accepted by the Bank. After cancellation,
approximately, US$1.4 million remained with the Directorate to fulfill the remaining contractual
commitments under the project.

Summary: Key Factors           Affecting   Implementation      (positive   and   negative)   and
response/action taken

Procurement: Despite constant support from the Bank team, procurement delays for goods
(medicines, diagnostic kits, insecticide products) and services (competitively bid contracts) and



                                                8
the inability of the Borrower to conclude procurement of critical project inputs, particularly
LLINs, prior to project closure severely limited the success of project implementation and the
efficiency with which the project was executed. These delays resulted in the cancellation of
project financing. The procurement aspects of the project are discussed in detail under section 2.4
Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance.

Financial Management: A standard cost approach to disbursement for decentralized
expenditures was a key project innovation. The financial management arrangements put in place
for decentralized expenditures however, posed several challenges during implementation,
including a poor understanding of the approach by states and districts, delays in district readiness
and delays in implementing integrated implementation and fiduciary reviews. In response to
indications in the integrated review reports that the decentralized expenditures were significantly
lower than the standard costs, the Bank requested the project team to submit state annual audit
reports and reconcile standard costs with actual expenditures. The financial management aspects
of the project are discussed in detail under section 2.4 Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance.

Human Resources: The successful implementation of the project was dependent on the
recruitment of qualified human resources at all levels with the ability to implement and monitor
the program. Project financing was used to staff key positions and cadres of personnel at central
state and district levels as well as training at all levels of the health pyramid. Domestic financing
supported the expansion of human resources, particularly multipurpose health workers and
Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA) at the block and village levels. The project and the
program achieved a qualified success in building human capacity despite difficulties in recruiting
and retaining consultants and staff and non-competitive compensation. Human resource issues
and challenges are discussed in greater detail under section 3.2 Achievement of Project
Development Objectives.

Monitoring and Evaluation: M&E arrangements affected project implementation in both
positive and negative ways. This is discussed in detail in section 2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation
(M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Indicators

The Project Data Sheet as included in the ISRs (and the present ICR) provides information on all
four Project Development Objective (PDO) level indicators and a sub-set (7 out of 13) of
intermediate outcome (IO) indicators included in the PAD and the Financial Agreement. It also
provides data for two World Bank core indicators that were not in place at the time of project
appraisal. Some indicators are worded differently in the Results Framework, the Financial
Agreement and the Project Data Sheet.

The number of IO level indicators included in the Results Framework is high and the description
of indicators is generally weak. These deficiencies were recognized by the Bank team and some
adjustments and clarifications were made to obtain the best available data but there was no formal
change in the indicators made. Despite these improvements, the following weaknesses remained:

       Numerators and particularly denominators were not well defined. Numerators and
        denominators lack specificity and were not quantified, some of the denominators (from
        different indicators) appear to overlap and may or may not be interchangeable. These



                                                 9
        include: population in high risk project areas; eligible districts; endemic districts;
        identified endemic areas; and targeted endemic areas.
       There is a lack of definition and consistency with respect to some of the
        interventions being measured. For example, some indicators specify long lasting
        insecticidal nets (LLIN) and others use insecticide treated nets (ITN) which includes
        LLIN as well as conventional nets treated (or retreated) with an insecticide prior to or
        following distribution.
       Some of the indicators measure the same or overlapping concepts. One PDO and two
        IO level indicators were designed to measure the coverage and/or use of insecticide based
        interventions for the control of malaria and/or kala azar. Only the PDO level indicator on
        LLIN use was monitored by the project, although the data reported did not come from
        household surveys as intended.
       There are several compound indicators in the Results Framework that are either
        hard to measure or hard to interpret. “Percentage of planned additional staff that is in
        position at central, state and district levels and received induction training” is actually a
        composite of six separate indicators and of little value for project monitoring unless
        disaggregated. Only one of the compound indicators was routinely monitored..
       Two of the PDO level indictors (LLIN use and treatment within 24 hours)
        correspond to the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) core indicators for malaria control;
        however, there are important deviations from the international standard. In both
        indicators, age group is not specified while the international standard is to report the
        indicators with reference to children less than five years of age for the purpose of
        international comparison. For the treatment indicator, the RBM core indicator attempts
        to measure treatment with an effective antimalarial (ACT) within 24 hours on onset of
        symptoms (fever) whereas the project reported on ACT treatment no later than on day
        after first contact, presumably meaning within 24 hours of providing a blood sample for
        diagnosis.

M&E for Polio

In order to attain elimination, the India Polio Eradication Program had put into place a very
effective system for monitoring and surveillance over the previous decade (since joining the
WHO launched Global Polio Eradication Initiative in 1995). The polio monitoring and
surveillance system uses global standard indicators and engages independent monitors to
constantly monitor the state of polio eradication. As the project was engaged only in financing
the three types of oral polio vaccine required by the program, the project included one PDO level
indicator on vaccine coverage which was validated by the independent monitors (including WHO
and CDC) engaged by National Polio Surveillance Project (NPSP) and one results level indicator
on stock outs of OPV for supplementary immunization activities which was available from
routine program reports.

M&E for Vector Borne Diseases

For the vector borne disease control components of the project, the approaches to monitoring and
evaluation were more ambitious and complex, involving: changes to existing data collection
tools; the introduction of indicators and data collection strategies that were new to the NVBDCP;
and engagement of multiple actors and institutions for proper execution. During project
preparation it was recognized that there were considerable human resource capacity constraints
for monitoring and evaluation at both central and state level which would need to be addressed
through recruitment and training of M&E specialists, external technical assistance and
outsourcing.


                                                10
The total number of individual activities in the monitoring and evaluation plan is very large, but
can be grouped into nine key activity clusters: (a) strengthening the health management
information system, including the introduction of streamlined formats for data collection; (b)
establishing sentinel surveillance for malaria deaths and kala azar hospitalizations and case
fatality rates in district health facilities with high case loads of malaria or kala azar; (c) facility
and population-based surveys, including cross-sectional household surveys (at baseline, mid-
project and endline) and annual surveys using the lot quality assurance sampling (LQAS)
approach; (d) creation of a logistics management information system (LMIS) to track
commodities; (e) quality assurance monitoring for drugs and diagnostics; (f) monitoring drug and
insecticide resistance; (g) pharmaco-vigilance using a protocol of prospective monitoring and
drug susceptibility testing for ACTs and Miltefosine; (h) operational research and impact
evaluations; and (i) joint technical program reviews led by the WHO. Each of the M&E activity
clusters contained multiple specific actions to be undertaken by a variety of actors under the
supervision and stewardship of the National Vector Borne Disease Control Program.

The ambitious plans for monitoring and evaluation were not fully realized and the project was
unable to generate the data required to effectively measure the malaria related indicators at PDO
or IO level. Due to weak capacity in M&E and chronic delays in contracting, only the baseline
household survey was completed and the approach for using LQAS data to generate point
estimates for outcome indicators (Large Country LQAS or LC-LQAS) was not applied according
to the proposed protocol. One exception may be in the state of Odisha where the process received
external support from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and the former Bank staff who
developed the approach. Elsewhere, the primary function of LQAS which was to monitor
coverage and use of project interventions at the PHC level, and the surveys were only carried out
in districts and blocks that had the required inputs for program implementation. The sample of
districts and blocks was the result of purposive rather than random selection and cannot be used
to generate aggregate measures for the entire target population. Some elements of the monitoring
and evaluation plan were successful and contributed to improve the quality and quantity of data
collected as well as the technical and allocative efficiency of the Program, such as:

    •   Technical assistance provided or financed by the Bank resulted in new and greatly
        simplified record keeping and reporting formats for case management and vector control
        activities, collection of data by community level providers and some progress toward
        integrating the VBD reporting system with the HMIS system under NRMH. The
        epidemiological data generated by this system provided credible evidence that there was
        a decrease in morbidity for malaria and kala azar. However, efforts to further automate
        the system were largely unsuccessful.
    •   Two sentinel sites were identified in all of the project districts and received support to
        improve diagnostic services. A majority of sites (303 out of 348 identified under the
        Bank project) were at least partially functional at Closing and routinely reporting to state
        officials.
    •   LQAS was (and continues to be) used for monitoring program implementation at sub
        district level and is valued by project staff responsible for tracking district and local
        implementation of malaria control and kaal-azar elimination. Aggregated LQAS data
        were generated routinely but were not adequate for tracking project indicators.
    •   A general management consultancy firm, Strategic Alliance Management Services
        (SAMS) was engaged to strengthen supply chain management and logistics for malaria
        control and kala azar elimination and was successful in developing a functional, partially
        automated, logistics management information system (LMIS) and in improving the
        overall system in terms of quantification, routine reporting and tracking and monitoring


                                                  11
        commodities with respect to their physical distribution, and expiration. The approach
        taken to the management of short-expiry commodities is an example of allocative
        efficiency in the project.
    •   Operations research activities for monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of and adverse
        reactions to newly introduced drugs, insecticide resistance monitoring, and the quality
        assurance of rapid diagnostic kits for malaria and kala azar diagnosis were managed by
        the National Institute of Medical Research and clearly contributed to the quality and
        technical efficiency of the project. For example, decreasing therapeutic efficacy of the
        co-blistered ACT combining artesunate and sufadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS+AQ) was
        detected in malaria endemic states in the north-east and the treatment protocol was
        changed to co-formulated artemether-lumefantrine (AL) in response.              Similarly,
        systematic quality assurance of RDTs, particularly important during the earlier years of
        the project (when there was significant quality variance between products as well as
        batches), was able to detect and eliminate from use, poorly performing batches of tests.
    •   An impact evaluation was conducted to assess community perceptions on malaria care-
        seeking practices and service delivery through supportive supervision and community
        mobilization.
    •   Two large scale reviews, referred to as WHO – NVBDCP Joint Monitoring Missions
        (which included the Bank and a large array of other development partners and
        stakeholders)framed the project implementation period and contributed significantly to
        project design and evaluation. JMM 2007 contributed to the technical design of the
        project and facilitated the introduction and roll out of new policies and technologies
        through the project. JMM 2014 was conducted concurrently with the World Bank ICR
        mission with full participation of the ICR team. It is also notable that WHO experts and
        other partners participated in the semi-annual project reviews conducted by the World
        Bank and borrower as part of routine project supervision.          

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The safeguard policies triggered by the project included: Environmental Assessment (OP/BP/GP
4.01); Pest Management (OP 4.09); and Indigenous peoples (OP) (BP 4.10). All three aspects of
safeguards are rated as moderately unsatisfactory for compliance due to slow implementation
progress despite strong policy foundation for the safeguards being in place.

Environment:

The project was classified as environmental safeguards category B, as it involved the use, storage,
transportation and disposal of insecticides in various applications. The project also involved the
introduction of rapid diagnostic tests which produce medical waste in the form of biologicals and
sharps.      During project preparation, field visits and assessments revealed that pesticide
management was inadequate and that attention to worker safety was weak. With technical
assistance from IDA, the National Vector Borne Disease Control Program (NVBDCP) prepared
an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) which defined the critical steps required to
strengthen pesticide management and the disposal of medical waste. The EMP was a framework
with guidelines to be adapted and incorporated into practice by the states. The EMP and
associated guidelines were communicated to the States by the NVBDCP. In order to facilitate
implementation of the EMP the project provided for the recruitment of an environmental
consultant at the central level, one entomologist for each state and malaria technical supervisors
at district level. The consultant contract to support EMP implementation was signed with M/s
Senes Consultants India Pvt. Ltd on March 26, 2011 – more than two years after project
effectiveness. This firm was engaged to assist NVBDCP in 1) strengthen guidelines for the


                                                12
handling and use of insecticides; 2) capacity building in environmental management at state,
district and sub-district levels; and, 3) monitor and report on the implementation of EMP
activities as per the required regulations and guidelines at all levels in project districts. The firm
undertook an assessment of issues and practices and developed and disseminated an
Environmental Code of Practice (ECoP) and associated pictorial training modules through
workshops and various training activities. The firm also monitored and reported on indoor
residual house spraying (IRS) rounds in 2012 and 2013.

Although the EMP, the Environmental Codes or Practice (ECoP) and training materials form a
solid basis for improving the management of insecticides and medical waste, in practice there are
still major challenges. Observation made by Senes as part of its monitoring and reporting function,
the Bank’s assessment of compliance with environmental safeguards during the final Project ISR
and observations from the JMM 2014 and ICR review were consistent: (i) personal protection
equipment (PPE) for spray workers (gloves, aprons and masks) are now being provided by the
DDT manufacturer, (ii) DDT is now being supplied in 25kg rather than 50kg bags which
facilitates transport and handling and reduces waste, and (iii) the ECoP and pictorial training
materials may be considered international best practice. However, PPE is not consistently
available and there is a need for BCC to consolidate worker willingness to use PPE. The
availability of storage space, the conditions of storage and the disposal of insecticides is below
prescribed norms. Training of spray teams and community mobilization in advance of IRS
rounds has been inconsistent across districts and over time, compromising the quality, safety and
coverage of control efforts for both malaria and kala azar. Efforts to reduce reliance on DDT for
IRS through improved insecticide management practices, the introduction of synthetic
pyrethroids for spraying and promotion of LLIN as an alternative to IRS has been patchy largely
due to the delays in the procurement of commodities. The JMM 2014 also noted that the
management of medical waste was sub-optimal and noted during field visits that universal
precautions, particularly the use of latex gloves whilst taking and processing blood samples for
diagnosis were not being implemented.

Social Safeguards:

Tribal people and other vulnerable communities in India bear a disproportionate burden of vector
borne diseases and have low access to health care and other services. They are socially and
economically disadvantaged suffering from poverty, low levels of education, social exclusion,
isolation from the mainstream economy and often live in areas with little or no service delivery
infrastructure. A social and beneficiary assessment (SABA) was carried out during project
preparation to engage tribal communities in project design. The outcome of the assessment and
consultation was a Vulnerable Communities Plan (VCP) which was meant to be integral to the
project’s overall implementation and the GOIs project implementation plan (PIP) and Operational
Plan.

The NVBDCP engaged the Voluntary Health Association of India (VHAI) to enhance the
effectiveness of malaria control and kala azar elimination through social mobilization and service
delivery amongst the vulnerable communities in project states. The main objectives of their
support was to (i) mobilize vulnerable communities for availing timely and appropriate
preventive and curative services; (ii) to build capacity of the peripheral health workers involved
in malaria control/ kala-azar elimination to sensitize on the needs of vulnerable communities; and
(iii) strengthen service delivery in selected villages in high endemic districts. The contract was
signed on February 2, 2011 –almost two years into the project implementation period. In parallel,
on January 28, 2011, the NVBDCP awarded a contract to M/s New Concept to develop a



                                                 13
behavior change communications (BCC) strategy, implementation plan, tools, messages and
materials.

The Moderately Unsatisfactory rating for implementation of the indigenous peoples safeguard is
due to slow progress in implementing the VCP. The issue was highlighted during the
implementation support mission in September of 2010 and repeatedly flagged during subsequent
missions throughout the project period. Although at times it was reported that some progress was
being made, the assessments were qualified by statements indicating key issues remained and
needed to be urgently addressed. The development of the BCC strategy, implementation plan and
associated tools progressed fairly well, however actual implementation by the contracted
consultants, states and districts was never fully realized. This is in part attributable to slow
decision taking and poor contract management by the MoHFW and the NVBDCP which delayed
payments for completed deliverables, fund release and approvals of the implementation plans of
the contracted agencies. The implantation of the VCP was never evaluated and documented,
despite repeated requests from the Bank. The final implementation support mission in November
2013 reported that the implementation of the VCP was less than satisfactory and that there was
“no indication that information, education and communication (IEC) or behavior change
communications (BCC) activities were being implemented on the ground.” During the last year
of the project, the NRHM took the decision that the implementation of these activities should be
the responsibility of the states and that the terms of reference (TORs) for the contracted agencies
should be modified to provide capacity building and monitoring support at district and block
levels. This decision had not been formally approved by the MoHFW at the time of the ICR
review and no action had been taken with respect to the contractors’ TORs.

Fiduciary

Overall, fiduciary compliance is rated as moderately unsatisfactory. Both procurement and
financial management were down-graded from moderately satisfactory to moderately
unsatisfactory at the end of the project implementation period. Procurement was downgraded due
to chronic delays in the procurement of critical project commodities which resulted in the
cancellation of project financing and failure of the project and the NVBDCP to provide services,
particularly malaria prevention based on use of LLIN, to the target population. Financial
management was downgraded primarily due to repeated delays in obtaining the annual audited
financial statements from the states and the FY12-13 audit report for the vector borne diseases
components of the project. The ICR team concurs with the ratings, but notes that it finds
procurement performance under the polio component of the project satisfactory while for the
VBD components the rating would be unsatisfactory.

As the project was very procurement intensive (almost 90% of the project cost was proposed to
be used for procurement contracts), many risk mitigation measures were put in place. The project
excluded decentralized procurement and required that all central procurement of goods and
services be managed by a professional procurement agent acceptable to the Bank. Decentralized
expenditures were limited to contractual staff, mobility and training costs and were provided on a
predetermined standard cost basis with provisions for external integrated implementation and
fiduciary monitoring as well as an enabling clause in the Project Financing Agreements allowing
the Bank to request the state annual audit reports as part of due diligence.

        a. Procurement




                                                14
During the first two years, procurement under the polio and VBDCP components was relatively
effective. Polio vaccines were procured through UNICEF and then subsequently through m/S
RITES. Between 2009 and 2012 procurement performance was good and US$167 million of the
allocated US$271 was spent on the three types of oral polio vaccine (OPV) required by the Polio
Eradication Program. Consistent with Bank requirements, OPV was only purchased from WHO
pre-qualified manufacturers during this period. However in 2011, the MoHFW decided to drop
WHO-prequalification in favor of good manufacturing practice (GMP) as a selection criterion in
order to obtain lower pricing from vaccine manufacturers in India. As this approach was not
consistent with Bank procurement requirements, the GOI elected to use domestic resources to
finance vaccine purchase and requested cancellation of the remaining US$ 88 million of Bank
financing for Component 4 of the project.

The procurement performance of the vector borne disease component was more problematic.
Initially, the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) was contracted to procure
malaria and Kala Azar commodities, such as LLIN, synthetic pyrethroid insecticides, diagnostic
test kits, pharmaceuticals and other commodities required by the program. However, procurement
started deteriorating from 2011 when RITES replaced UNOPS as the procurement agent at the
insistence of the client. At this time the tendency toward risk adverse behavior and inaction with
respect to procurement was heightened. The Controller and Auditor General (CAG) heavily
criticized the procurement process used in some non-Bank projects, resulting in
investigations/sanctions against some bureaucrats and procurement officials). This in turn
prompted project officials as well as the procurement agent to take a risk-averse approach, which
resulted in substantial delays in procurement process. As a result many important commodities
(notably LLINs) could not be procured before the closure of the project and funds allocated for
this component were largely cancelled.

Near the end of the project, to mitigate the delays in central level procurement, the Bank agreed
to procurement of LLIN by some of the states but even this was not permitted by MoHFW. As a
result only about US$43 million was used in vector borne disease control components of the
project for procurement of goods and 68% of the allocated financing for these components was
cancelled prior to project closure.

The procurement challenges identified in the review of the project were also reflected in the
preliminary findings of the 2014 Joint Monitoring Mission of the NVBDCP and the WHO, which
examined both central level procurement and decentralized procurement (which was originally
disallowed under the Bank’s Financing). The JMM noted that there has been continuous failure
in the procurement of LLINs for three years (2011-2014) and delays in procurement of other
items (pharmaceuticals, rapid diagnostic test kits, etc) at central level noting that some supply
side factors and “apprehension of collusion” contributed to the delays. The report also noted that
at state level, decentralized procurement of the core commodities –drugs, diagnostics and LLINs
was also unsatisfactory resulting in delays, higher costs or concerns about quality. It was further
noted that UNICEF provided assistance in some states for the procurement of LLIN using non-
Bank financing.

        b. Financial Management


Central level expenditures, including vaccines, were to be reimbursed on six monthly/annual
basis and validated annually through audit reports. Although decentralized procurement was
disallowed, project implementation did require the financing of decentralized expenditures. The
essential categories of expenditure at State and District level were defined as contractual staff,


                                                15
mobility (vehicles and transport) and training. In lieu of reimbursements based on detailed audits
of state and district level accounts, an approach to financing decentralized expenditures based on
predetermined standard costs was adopted. The standard cost approach provided the benefits of
financing for critical activities at the State and District level without the need to maintain separate
records for Bank funds or undergo separate audits, thereby reducing transaction costs for the
borrower. The benefits to the Bank were an opportunity to test an innovative approach that
responded to client needs and promoted greater collaboration between fiduciary and program
teams to meet project objectives.

For the decentralized expenditures financed through standard cost mechanism it was proposed
that fiduciary assurance would be derived primarily through “integrated implementation and
fiduciary review” by an external consultant and IDA supervision missions. The TORs for the
implementation and fiduciary review of decentralized activities were discussed and agreed during
project negotiations (9-13 June, 2008). The approach was intended to intensify field level input
and output monitoring for a sample of project districts on a semi-annual basis, coupled with a
review of project implementation. The objective of this monitoring was to document that under
the standard cost mechanism (i) activities were being executed; (ii) states and districts were able
to deliver the planned outputs; and (iii) the actual expenditures of the decentralized activities
financed by the Bank were broadly comparable with the estimated standard costs.

Implementation experience, as evidenced by the Aide Memoires and ISRs indicates that the
financial management arrangements for the project remained valid and reflected `Moderately
Satisfactory’ FM performance ratings through a large part of the project life. Delays in
submission of audit reports for central level expend were noted but did not significantly impact
the quality of fiduciary assurance arrangements. For the payments to suppliers under the Polio
component, MoHFW opted for the direct payments method of disbursement. For each such direct
payment made by the World Bank to the suppliers at the behest of MoHFW, complete
documentation including copies of (a) Bank’s no objection fax message, (b) notification of award;
(c) original invoices; (d) consignee acknowledgement receipt; (e) original packing note; (f)
airway bills; (g) Manufacturer Warranty Certificate; (h) self-attested internal test analysis report
of vaccines; (i) insurance and inland transit policy certificate; and (j) supplier’s certificate of
origin were provided to support the payment requests. These due diligence measures were
supplemented by third party verification of the utilization of the OPV in the field through WHO
household surveys. Based on this, an exception was obtained from Financial Management
Operations Review Committee on 08-Oct-2013 for submission of annual audit reports for the
Polio component.

The financial management arrangements put in place for decentralized expenditures however,
posed several challenges during implementation. To start with, there was a delay in the
recruitment of the consulting firm to carry out the integrated implementation and fiduciary
reviews [first report received in early 2011]. Secondly, district readiness took much longer than
expected and at some time during the project there was a redistricting which led to an increase in
the number of districts in the project, and presumably costs. Thirdly, although the Bank team
made repeated efforts to explain the concept and associated processes, the standard cost approach
was poorly understood and implemented, particularly at State and District levels where the
resources were perceived to be rigidly allocated for very narrowly defined uses within the three
expenditure categories of staffing, mobility and training. Standard costs for salaries became
ceilings and were not adjusted annually leading to problems with recruitment and retention as the
salary levels were not competitive even with the NRHM. Inability to ensure commodity supplies
at the field level exacerbated the staff motivation levels, resulting in significant levels of
vacancies in staff positions. The need for greater flexibility for decentralized units to move funds


                                                  16
across categories and to broaden definitions was noted in several Aide Memoires. In response to
indications in the integrated review reports that the decentralized expenditures were significantly
lower than the standard costs, the Bank used the enabling clause in the Project Financing
Agreements to request the project to submit state annual audit reports. This was part of the due
diligence efforts initiated by the Bank to establish adequacy of the expenditures with respect to
the standard costs. This exercise, however, had its own challenges; and included (a) delays in
submission of state audit reports; and (b) difficulties in establishing the actual expenditures, as
these were not easily identifiable in the financial statements. This exercise took considerable time
and effort in terms of triangulation of information from several different sources (e.g., Utilization
Certificates, statements of expenditures, and annual audit reports) and was concluded only in the
last year of the project.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

At the time of project closure there were no plans for a next phase or follow-on project, although
the need for addition support, especially for malaria control, is high.

Vector Borne Diseases

The NVBDCP is a part of the National Health Mission (NHM) which is a high-priority GOI
program that has been receiving an increasing budget allocation under successive five year plans.
At the time of project preparation, 72% of the NVBDCP budget was expected from domestic
financing with the remaining 28% from IDA and the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and
Malaria (GFATM) who were the only external donor partners of the program. Discussions were
held with the Directorate of the NVBDCP and the MoHFW on the sustainability of the project
interventions beyond project closure, with particular emphasis on the need to ensure that systems
set up under the project and lessons learned are appropriately embedded in the NVBDCP and
NMH as part of the implementation of the 12th five year plan (2012 to 2017). Given the
increasing support from the GOI to the health sector and a focus on fully integrating
administrative procedures under the NHM, the MoHFW has confirmed its intention to continue to
fund positions funded under the Bank-financed project at central, state and district levels until the
end of March 2014 and that a new proposal was made by the MoHFW for the continuation of this
funding until the end of the 5-year plan (2012-2017). Although these positions are likely to be
sanctioned by the MoHFW, many will remain vacant until policies promoting pay parity, at least
within the NRMH, are implemented.

As the project ended with a fairly substantial unfinished agenda with respect to the vector-born
disease control components, it is important to note that the NVBDCP has indicated that several
unfinished activities will be taken forward with domestic financing such as the end-line
household survey. Furthermore, the states have started taking on responsibility for the
implementation of the IEC and BCC activities and making use of the “innovations” developed
under the project, although there is still a need for capacity building and monitoring support at the
district and block levels.

During project preparation and implementation, the Bank promoted donor coordination and the
harmonization of support for malaria control and kala azar elimination. The Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation (BMGF), UK Department for International Development (DFID), the Global
Fund, UNICEF and WHO participated in joint missions and provided technical guidance in a
harmonized manner to ensure consistency across the programs run by the NVBDCP. Going
forward, partners have agreed to map the implementation and technical gaps and attempt to
mobilize appropriate technical and financial support for successful program implementation


                                                 17
throughout the country. There is preliminary evidence that the Global Fund may be able to
address a portion of the gap in support for malaria control under their new implementation model
and that the BMGF and other development partners will continue to support the elimination of
kala azar.

Polio

With the elimination of polio from the borders of India, the focus of the National Polio
Eradication program is now shifting to the prevention of re-introduction of the polio virus. “The
risk of polio persists in India, with continuing poliovirus transmission in neighboring countries
and outbreaks across the World. Globally since 2000, as many as 49 countries that had been
polio free have suffered from one or more importations of wild poliovirus.” 2 To mitigate the risk
of importation from across the border, vaccination posts have been set up at 102 locations along
India’s international borders. The polio program network is also turning its attention to broader
health issues in India and the state governments are capitalizing on the polio surveillance and
social mobilization networks to strengthen routine immunization and convergent health initiatives.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

Overall, the project is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory because only two of the four PDO
indicator targets were fully achieved (see discussion below). As mentioned earlier, project
implementation was plagued by delays while the project design was ambitious, complex and was
highly dependent on central procurement and the successful implementation of new approaches to
monitoring and evaluation. Procurement delays for both goods and services and the failure of the
project to conduct an adequate baseline survey and the complete absence of a mid-term or end-
line surveys resulted in chronic implementation delays, low intervention coverage and poor
documentation of progress –particularly for the malaria control component of the project. As a
result of these delays, US$258 million (49.5%) of the US$521 million of IDA financing allocated
to the project was cancelled.

For VBD, there is epidemiological evidence suggesting that the project made a positive
contribution to malaria control, kala azar elimination and capacity (primarily a temporal
correlation between the availability of project inputs and concurrent downward trends in disease
incidence and mortality), however the project did not fulfill its potential to contribute to malaria
control and kala azar elimination. And, in the absence of end-line household surveys, the
constructed values (derived from LQAS data not intended for this purpose) for the two malaria
specific PDOs and several of the intermediary results cannot be accepted as reliable estimations.
Still, the polio component of the project made a sizable and timely contribution to vaccine
security during the “end-game” of polio eradication in India and clearly contributed to
achievement of the eradication objective.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Objectives:




2
 “India’s Story of Triumph over Polio: reaching every child with two drops of life” The United Nations
Chidren’s Fund (UNICEF), 2014. P.191.



                                                   18
The relevance of the overall project development objective - “to enhance the effectiveness of
government capacity to control malaria, eliminate kala azar and eradicate polio” - was high and
responded directly to the expressed needs of the borrower. India’s National Health Policy (2002)
called for reducing malaria mortality by 50% and eliminating kala azar by the year 2010, and the
GOI joined the global polio eradication efforts in in 1995. The World Bank had been assisting
the GOI in its efforts to combat malaria since 1997 and to eradicate polio since 1999. The Bank’s
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for India 2005-08 identified the control and, when feasible,
the elimination of infectious diseases as a priority for IDA assistance, and noted its importance
for the poor disproportionately affected by such diseases. Project relevance is further supported
by the CAS 2009-2012 which emphasizes the importance of assisting India to achieve the
Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) and to increase the effectiveness of service delivery in
the health sector , particularly among the poorest states. At the time of project preparation the
most deadly strain of malaria (p. falciparum) was on the rise due to high levels of resistance to
chloroquine; kala azar cases were concentrated in a small number of states and districts and India
reported more than half of all polio cases globally and was one of only four counties that had not
successfully eliminated polio. The project objectives also aligned with India and the Bank’s
commitment to meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the Bank-wide
commitment to malaria control, as adopted in the Bank’s Global Strategy and Malaria Control
Booster Program in 2005.

Design:

Project design was highly relevant but complex and based on several high risk assumptions. The
project sought to capitalize on: the launch of the National Rural Health Mission (2005) which
aims to provide affordable and effective health care to all citizens, in particular to the poorer and
most vulnerable sections of the population; the GOIs commitment to strengthen national capacity
for the control of vector borne diseases, including malaria and kala azar; significant shifts in
policies and strategies for vector borne diseases which involved the transition to more effective
tools for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of malaria and kala azar; and an opportunity to
provide financing security for OPV to assist the GOI achieve polio eradication.

Three of the four project components were associated with vector born disease control: one
focused on malaria control, the second on kala azar elimination and the third on capacity building
at all levels of the health system for implementing the new policies and strategies. The fourth
component was simply financing for the procurement of OPV. The malaria and kala azar
components were to be implemented in two phases to accommodate a learning curve associated
with the introduction of new policies and technologies. These components and the plan to
implement in stages were logical given the assessed needs of the programs. The necessary
ingredients for success were all identified and plans were made to put them in place. However,
in retrospect, while the focus of the project design was highly relevant, the design of project
implementing arrangements seemed overly dependent on centrally procured commodities;
constrained by lack of flexibility particularly with respect to district readiness filters and
decentralized funding; overly ambitious in including a second phase of implementation; and
burdened with an overly complex approach to monitoring and evaluation. Given that the success
of the project depended heavily on the design of these arrangements, the overall relevance of
design is downgraded from High to Substantial.

Therefore, on balance, the relevance of the objectives and design is rated as Substantial.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives



                                                 19
The project development objective is “to enhance the effectiveness of Recipient’s efforts to
control malaria, eliminate kala azar and eradicate polio.” In accordance with the FA version of
the PDO (which this ICR deems as the more fitting version given project design), this was to be
achieved by:
    (a) increasing the number of people benefiting from effective prevention, diagnosis and
        treatment services for malaria and kala azar;
    (b) strengthening central and state capacities for evidence-based policy development,
        strategic planning, and program management for effective control of vector-borne
        diseases; and
    (c) securing the timely supply of polio vaccines.

As mentioned in section 2.3 above, incomplete reporting and the absence of mid-term or end-line
data from planned but unrealized population-based household surveys made it difficult to assess
the adequacy of progress towards achievement of the PDO, particularly with respect to malaria
control.

PDO, Part (a): increase the number of people benefiting from effective prevention,
diagnosis and treatment services for malaria and kala azar.

        MALARIA: Improve access to and use of malaria prevention and control services.

PDO indicator 1: Percentage of fever cases in project districts receiving a malaria test result no
later than the day after the first contact. TARGET 70%. Indicator was not reliably measured due
to partial baseline survey and no follow-up surveys. Aggregated LQAS data (not intended to
measure this indicator) suggest that the weighted average of all communities sampled in five
Phase 1 project states was approximately 54.3% ( range 38-92%). In two states, the data from
sampled communities showed that the target had been exceeded.

PDO indicator 2: Percentage of individuals in project areas belonging to eligible Long Lasting
Insecticidal Net (LLIN) target population who slept under an LLIN during the previous night.
TARGET 50% Indicator was not reliably measured due to partial baseline survey and no follow-
up surveys. Aggregated LQAS (not intended to measure this indicator) suggest that the weighted
average of all communities sampled in five Phase 1 project states was approximately 28.6%%
( range 20-43.5%). None of the states achieved the target.

Malaria remains a significant public health problem in India. While about 95% of the population
resides in malaria endemic or malaria risk areas, where epidemics may occur, 80% of reported
cases are confined to tribal, hilly, difficult and inaccessible areas with only 20% of the population.
The approach to malaria control taken under the project was to promote implementation of new
policies and technologies for the prevention (introduction of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN)
as an alternative to indoor residual spraying with DDT or synthetic pyrethroids), diagnosis and
treatment of malaria (introduction of community-based diagnosis using quality assured rapid
diagnostic tests (RDT) and treatment of P. falciparum positive cases with an artemesinin-based
combination treatment (ACT) positive cases in 124 districts with the highest burden of the disease.
The JMM 2014 concurred with the overall malaria strategy noting that it is based on a correct
combination of effective case management and anti-vector measures, differentiated and targeted
according to the local epidemiological, entomological and operational situations. The JMM also
noted that malaria surveillance, program logistics and communication are also essential elements
of malaria control, which have been rightly emphasized.



                                                 20
The approach remains relevant and there is a significant unfinished agenda at the end of project,
particularly with respect to the very low coverage of LLIN in the target population due to chronic
delays in central procurement and the apparent further deterioration of an already weak program
of IRS. The introduction of ACTs for the treatment of p. falciparum and the associated
monitoring of drug resistance is another element of the unfinished agenda. Already resistance to
the co-blistered combination of artesunate + sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine has emerged in the
North-East region of the country necessitating a change in treatment policy to co-formulated
artemether-lumefantrine. Drug resistance monitoring was a critical (and successful) activity
under the project and must be continued going forward, particularly given how little is
known/documented about the use of antimalarial drugs, both combination and montherapy, in the
private sector and the daunting emergence of resistance to artemesinin derivatives in neighboring
South-East Asia.

As previously noted, chronic delays associated with contractual actions, particularly LLIN
procurement, severely limited access to and use of malaria prevention and control services. An
analysis by Dr. Allan Schapira, co-Chair of JMM 2014 and technical advisor to the project,
suggests that if the LLIN had been procured and distributed as planned, 394,460 reported cases of
malaria and 5.160 malaria deaths could have been prevented. Nonetheless, the project did provide
LLIN protection to approximately 16.6 million people (assuming 2.5 persons protected by each
LLIN purchased); 24.1 million rapid diagnostic tests for malaria and 2.81 million courses of ACT
for the treatment of P. falciparum malaria. Although there is no direct evidence that the project
development objectives and intermediate results were achieved due to limited geographic
coverage and late implementation of the baseline survey and the absence of any follow-on
surveys, there is some indication from data reviewed by the JMM 2014 that progress has been
made towards higher level objectives to which the project was intended to contribute, as follows:

        For malaria morbidity, the JMM 2014 found the reported trends reliable enough to concur
        that the objective of a 40% reduction in malaria morbidity between 2006 and 2012 has
        been achieved, although the actual number of malaria cases is estimated to be six times
        higher than the number reported as many people with fever do not seek care from public
        facilities.

        With respect to malaria mortality, the goal of reducing deaths by 50% by 2010 (compared
        to 2002) was achieved by 2013 according to NVBDC monitoring data. Unfortunately,
        monitoring of mortality is weak and the number of actual deaths due to malaria may be
        between 15 to 50 times the actual numbers reported. Nonetheless, the trends are
        consistent with sentinel surveillance data collected from two hospitals in each high
        burden district. The sharp decline in malaria mortality from 2010 to 2013 is plausible, as
        RDT-ACT services were implemented at a large scale in high-burden districts from that
        year, but the mortality surveillance is not strong enough to indicate by how much the real
        mortality has decreased.

Rating: Modest. Although the reported data indicate encouraging trends, the PDO level indicator
target were not adequately measured and are unlikely to have been met given indicative data.

        KALA AZAR: Improve access to and use of services for elimination of kala azar

PDO indicator 3. At least 50% of the sampled blocks which at baseline have not achieved the
elimination goal of less than one kala azar case per 10,000 persons, will achieve elimination goal
by endline. TARGET 50% Data Source is routine data from program records. Target was
exceeded: 58.6%

Kala azar was and remains a significant public health problem primarily in three states: Bihar,
Jharkand and West Bengal. The vast majority of those cases (80%) are from Bihar and most of
those in only nine districts. The project was intended to contribute to the national objective of
elimination of kala zar from India by 2015. The specific activities financed by the project reflect
the findings and recommendations of the WHO – NVBDCP Joint Monitoring Mission 2007
(JMM 2007) which found deficiencies in the control of kala azar but which concluded that
disease elimination was technically feasible. The target for elimination is to reduce the annual
incidence of kala azar to less than one per 10,000 population at the block level. The key
indicators for monitoring the progress includes incidence of kala azar cases per 10,000
populations at block level, the case fatality rate and the treatment compliance rate. The Bank
financed project specifically sought to improve the diagnosis and treatment of kala azar by
strengthening service delivery and introducing rapid diagnostic tests and new treatment options
(oral Miltefosine and Paromycin injections) for the disease; strengthening kala azar surveillance
(an essential strategy in disease elimination); and, promoting more effective vector control in 46
of the 54 endemic districts in the country.

The project has facilitated major reforms in the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of kala azar.
Orally administered Miltefosine has now been adopted nationally as the first line of treatment for
the disease, and is being used in 16 of the 31 districts targeted under Phase I of the project. The
expansion through the project of the use of RDTs to diagnose kala azar, and the subsequent
national adoption of this method of diagnosis, has also accelerated progress towards the control of
kala azar.

As with malaria, the objectives and design of the project with respect to kala azar continue to be
relevant. There is room for improvement with respect to several of the implementation strategies,
including (i) revision of the current treatment guidelines to include new treatment regimens which
are more effective, safer and ensure better compliance; (ii) updating selection criteria for kala
azar diagnostic kits to address accuracy and usability in field conditions (including thermo
stability and usability with whole blood); (iii) better and more consistent approaches to incentives
for providers and patients, social mobilization and behavior change communication; and (iv)




                                                22
updated approaches to integrated vector management to increase acceptability, quality and
coverage.

Although the limited geographic scope of kala azar may give the impression that it is not a
significant public health problem for India as a whole, it is a very significant problem in effected
communities.

The NVBDCP has reported that many issues and challenges were encountered that had a negative
impact on the implementation of the kala azar elimination program and the effective use of Bank
financing including: (i) delays in the release of funds for implementation of program activities;
(ii) a large number of vacancies of health functionaries resulting in inadequate supervision and
monitoring; (iii) chronic delays or non-payment of patient and provider incentives; (iv) low
acceptance of DDT house praying attributed to inadequate IEC/BCC; and (v) stock-outs of
essential drugs and other commodities.

Nonetheless, the Directorate has reported that the targets for the project development objective
and one of two intermediate results associated with kala azar have been exceeded.




The progress towards elimination, despite many challenges encountered in program
implementation is highly encouraging. The NVBDCPE is likely to have made an important
contribution improving access to and the use of community of health services for the elimination
of kala azar, by financing and encouraging the provision of field level staff, drug treatments and
tests, where only limited services existed prior to the project’s intervention. With a more
aggressive and well managed approach “similar to how India addressed polio elimination” there
is a viable opportunity to complete the unfinished business and eliminate kala azar from the
borders of India.

Malaria was allocated almost 75% of the budget associated with this part of the PDO as it
represents a greater overall epidemiologic and economic burden in India than kala azar, effecting
a larger number of people, districts and states. As such, on balance, the modest rating for malaria




                                                23
and the successful rating for kala azar combine to provide an overall rating of modest efficacy for
Part a of the PDO.

PDO, Part (b): strengthen central and state capacities for evidence-based policy
development, strategic planning, and program management for effective control of vector-
borne diseases.

There are no PDO level indicators associated with program management and capacity building.
There are five relevant Intermediate Outcome indicators for this part of the PDO of which only
two have been monitored: Percentage of planned additional staff who are in position at central,
state and district levels who are in place and who received training; and Proportion of eligible
districts meeting the readiness criteria for each period of implementation. In addition, there is a
World Bank Core Indicator, Number of health personnel receiving training, which has been
monitored. Nonetheless, to supplement the paucity of indicators, the ICR team was able to gather
information about this part of the project which is presented below.

The project was designed and implemented to scale up new policies and strategies and introduce
new technologies for vector born disease control, whilst strengthening human resources and
health systems to ensure ongoing effective implementation. Although the project did not succeed
in meeting all of its targets, it did contribute to durable positive changes in policy and capacity
through demonstration of concept and identification of challenges.

New diagnostic tools and effective treatments for malaria and kala azar have been put in place
and it has been adequately demonstrated that malaria can be effectively managed and documented
by community workers. The value added of multi-purpose health workers (MPW) and accredited
social health activists (ASHA) for vector borne disease control is now widely accepted. Quality
assurance of diagnostics and routine monitoring of the therapeutic efficacy of drugs and
pharmaco-vigilance is in place and has already had an impact on treatment policy.

Program Management and Capacity Building (including policy and strategy development)

One of the key issues that the project sought to address was the capacity of the borrower to carry
out the normative functions associated with vector borne disease control and the supplemental
activities proposed under the project. This included policy and strategy development;
procurement and supply chain management; commodity quality assurance; drug and insecticide
resistance monitoring; financial management; behavior change communications; environmental
safeguards; training; and, program implementation, monitoring and evaluation. As such, much of
the non-commodity financing was directed at 1) strengthening human resources at the central,
state and district levels through recruitment and training, and 2) outsourcing and contracting
specific tasks or areas of work requiring specialized skills.

    (1) Human resources and training:  

The project proposed to finance 44 positions (14 professional and 30 support staff) at central
level; 55 consultants at state level; and 124 vector-borne disease specialists (VBD), 744 malaria
or kala azar technical supervisors (MTS or KTS) and 372 laboratory technicians (LT) at district
level. In addition the project intended to support training and incentives to 6849 MPW and more
the 455,000 ASHA. Central and state level positions were intended to address gaps in core skill
sets associated with management and stewardship of the program while the positions at district,
block and village levels were needed to ensure the day-to-day implementation, supervision and



                                                24
monitoring of project activities. Training was required for health functionaries at all levels and a
comprehensive training strategy was developed.

The recruitment and retention of key staff as well as their weak capacity were key constraints to
smooth implementation during the entire project period as has been the case in a number of Bank-
financed operations in India. The national and state level positions and the district VBD
consultants financed by the project were initially recruited with the support of the National Health
System Resource Center (NHSRC) and later directly by the NVBDCP. District level MTS, KTS
and LTs were recruited by the states. MPWs and ASHAs, who engage in community health
activities other than vector-borne disease control were recruited under the NRHM programs but
trained in malaria control and kala azar elimination under the project.

Although the investment in human resources was critical to the limited success of the project,
there were a high number of vacancies at all levels and across all states throughout the project
implementation period; and, slow recruitment at the beginning of the project is often cited as the
primary reason for delayed district readiness and consequently delayed disbursement of
decentralized funds. The key factor that contributed to the recruitment delays and poor retention
was non-competitive compensation. Salary and benefits were low in comparison to positions
requiring similar or equivalent skills and qualifications in the private and public sector, including
positions in the NRHM. This may have been, in part, due to the poor understanding and
implementation of the standard cost approach to decentralized financing (see financial
management above). Standard cost estimates for compensation made at the beginning of the
project were not adjusted during the project and were seen as “ceilings” and no annual increment
was applied resulting in the positions becoming less competitive over time. Some states have
begun addressing this problem by adopting and implementing policies on “pay parity”. However,
this did not have a major effect on the project during implementation. At the close of the project,
11 of the 14 key positions at central level were vacant. Vacancies at state and district level were
36% and 31% respectively.

It might be asserted that non-competitive compensation would result in the recruitment of weak
candidates. However, the core problem encountered was not the talent of individuals but the
sheer number of vacancies and the continual need to recruit and train replacements. At no point
in the project were central or state level teams complete and fully trained and often, and some of
the most critical skill sets required for effective project implementation were completely absent.

    (2) Outsourcing and contracting:  

The project financed the National Institute of Malaria Research (NIMR) and the Rajendra
Memmorial Research Insitute, Patna (RMRI) to manage operational research, which included
pharmacovigilance of newly introduced drugs, therapeutic efficacy of ACT and insecticide
resistance monitoring, quality assurance testing of rapid diagnostic test kits for malaria and kala-
azar and sentinel surveillance, and the baseline household. With the exception of the household
survey (see monitoring and evaluation section below), these organizations had the specialized
skills, disease focus and the infrastructure required and outsourcing this set of tasks and work
areas was both sensible and effective.

The VBDCP engaged consulting services to address the need for some of the products and
services required for project implementation including training; fiduciary review; environmental
management planning; supply chain logistics management information systems (LMIS);
information, education and communications (IEC) and behavior change communications (BCC)
support. On the whole, consultants performed well, although the award of consulting contracts


                                                 25
and the approval of proposals was subject to the same delays and weak management and
stewardship that limited the procurement of goods. This was particularly injurious to the project
with respect to multiple delays in recruitment of the fiduciary consultant as integrated
implementation and fiduciary reviews of decentralized costs were not in place during 40% of the
project period. Weak management and stewardship of contracts and contractors was associated
with chronic delays in payments to contractors and in failure of the NVBDCP and MoHFW to
take decisions in a timely manner with respect to contractor proposals. For example, one of the
contractors successfully developed and pretested IEC and BCC materials and submitted a
proposal to implement activities at a larger scale consistent with the contractor’s terms of
reference. No action was taken with respect to the proposal for an extended period. Eventually,
it was decided to hand over responsibility for IEC and BCC implementation to the states and
modify the terms of reference of the contractor to focus on capacity building and monitoring at
district and block levels. The project ended before these changes were approved.

Rating: Modest. Sub-optimal performance was associated with persistent vacancies of key
positions at the central and state level and delays in contracting.

PDO, Part (c): secure the timely supply of polio vaccine

PDO indicator 4: At least 80% of the households with eligible children covered during the
national and sub-national immunization days in high risk districts. TARGET >80%. Data
obtained through an independent monitoring system assocoiated with the Global Polio
Eradication Initiative with support from WHO and CDC. Target was exceeded: >98%

The World Bank contribution to the polio elimination program in India was in the form of
financing for commodities. While the polio elimination program was well-manned, planned,
monitored and supervised adequate buffer stocks of vaccines were not available to allow for the
short term changes in vaccination approach needed to respond to the type of polio virus found in
each vaccination round. The project financed the MoHFW to procure three types of oral polio
vaccine (OPV) worth approximately US$167 million (out of US$271 allocated) in OPV. This
was carried out at a critical point in elimination process and therefore the project can take credit
for a substantial contribution to the elimination of polio in India. There have been no reported
cases of polio since a two-year old girl was diagnosed with polio paralysis on January 13, 2011 in
Howrah district of West Bengal. After three years with no new polio infections and the
maintenance of an incredibly high rate of vaccination coverage even in the most remote areas
(99%), India was declared and certified polio free on March 29, 2014.  This is an incredible
success for a country, which reported more than half the global polio cases until the year 2009,
and which was predicted by many experts to be the last to stop polio as its endemic pockets in
parts of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar were among the most difficult places in the world for polio
eradication.

Rating: Successfully achieved.

On balance, the rating for Efficacy is Modest given that objectives (a) and (b) were only
modestly achieved while objective (c) was fully achieved.

3.3 Efficiency

The Economic and Financial Analysis conducted during project preparation focused primarily on
the evidence base concerning the cost effectiveness of the interventions to be financed by the
project and an estimate of the costs and benefits of introducing the new diagnosis and treatment


                                                26
protocols for malaria and kala azar. Public financing of polio eradication is considered well
justified using standard public financing criteria. The elimination of polio from India is
considered a global public good and the benefits of eradication are infinite. For the vector borne
disease control objectives, the overall efficiency rating is low given the absence of key
commodities to support planned interventions throughout the implementation period and given
that most of the funds for this area were cancelled given procurement inefficiencies; however,
there are some examples of good practices within the project that enhanced technical and or
allocative efficiency. Overall, efficiency is rated as Modest. A detailed discussion of project
efficiency is included in Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis.

3.4 Justification for overall outcome rating

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

This rating is based on a combination of Substantial Relevance, Modest Efficacy and Modest
Efficiency. Efficacy and efficiency were higher for the polio component of the project than for
the VBD components.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
 (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Poverty Impacts:

The project targeted services to the communities with a high burden of malaria and kala azar.
Given the nature of these two diseases and their association with poverty, these communities are
also amongst the poorest, most remote and underserved in India. Malaria is both a disease of
poverty and a cause of poverty: poor children and women living in rural areas are at the greatest
risk of death or severe debility from malaria and the disease drains the resources of families and
keeps the poor in poverty. Poverty may prevent some households from spending on prevention
or an effective cure, leaving malaria illness untreated, risking complications, and thus over time
having a depletory impact on a household’s ability to cope with other contingencies. Studies on
health care expenditures have consistently shown that most of the money spent on malaria
prevention and treatment comes out of the pockets of individuals and households. Kala azar is
also a disease of the poor and keeps families in poverty. The JMM 2007 found that 60-70% cases
accessed the private sector for diagnosis and treatment. In addition to wage loss for a significant
period for the kala azar patient, the high cost of under-regulated and likely poor or inadequate
diagnosis and treatment impoverished families. Although the project did not succeed in providing
access to free LLINs to all communities as planned due to delayed and incomplete procurement
processes, community based diagnosis and treatment for malaria and kala azar was available to a
large proportion of the target population. Free diagnosis and effective treatment provided by
Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA) and financial incentives to kaala azar patients to
improve treatment compliance were very pro-poor strategies and the Mid-term Review (MTR)
highlighted the observation that beneficiaries were increasingly seeking care in the public sector
due to the availability of commodities and improved services.

Polio eradication is a global public good and as such the benefits accrue to the rich and poor, men
and women alike. However, in the final stages of polio eradication, pockets of polio transmission
and cases are concentrated in the most geographically remote and hard to reach populations, who
lack access to many basic services, and among people who do not perceive the benefits of
vaccination. As such, the focus of efforts (supplemental immunization activities, mop-ups and



                                                27
outbreak response) during the project period focused on poor, vulnerable and hard to reach
populations.

Gender:

One of the initiatives carried out at district level with support of the NVBDCP was the “Mo-
Moshari” (My Mosquito Net) program which provided conventional insecticide treated nets
(ITNs that require periodic retreatment with insecticide) to pregnant women and to students at
residential tribal schools. Recruitment and training of MPWs and ASHA took gender into
account, two cadres of multi-purpose health workers, one male and the other female, were
recruited under NHM and trained with project funding and all ASHA were women. Overall, the
project contributed to the training and incentives for ASHA, mobilizing and equipping them to
provide diagnosis and treatment for malaria and kala azar at the community level, which
contributed to their status in the community. A review of ASHA performance during the JMM
2014 noted that one of the constraints to the recruitment of ASHA, particularly in remote tribal
areas, was the low level of female literacy in these communities.

Social Development:

The project integrated the Vulnerable Communities Plan (VCP) into the project implementation
plan and operational plan. The GOI has a legal and institutional framework for vulnerable
communities who are described as “groups with social, cultural, economic and/or political
traditions and institutions distinct from mainstream or dominant society that disadvantage them in
the development process” (PAD p. 130). Indigenous peoples (tribal groups), scheduled castes
(those who remain outside of the four Hindu castes, including socially or economically deprived
Budhist and Sikh populations) and people living below the poverty line are considered to be
vulnerable communities. The VCP contains many specific actions associated with the three
vector borne disease control components of the project and the NVBDCP engaged the Voluntary
Health Association of India to implement the plan, however implementation progress was slow
and incomplete leading to a moderately unsatisfactory rating for social safeguards. Details are
provided in section 2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Human resources for the implementation of vector borne disease control strategies have been
strengthened at the district, block and community level (although most positions at central and
state level are vacant) and domestic financing is being put in place to the end of the five year
planning cycle ending in 2017 to ensure continuity of access to services. The project’s
contribution appears to be more successful (in terms of vacancy rates) and more permanent at
district and block levels than at state and national level. Establishment of the cadres of Vector
Borne Disease Consultants, Malaria and Kala azar Technical Supervisors and the expansion of
the network of Laboratory Technicians were important project contributions. If the GOI can
continue to resolve the issue of pay parity, recruitment and retention will become less of a
problem in the future. At central and state levels, where the project’s contribution to human
capacity provided for the recruitment of more specialized skills (financial management,
procurement, monitoring and evaluation, information, education and communication, etc) may be
less durable. Although many of the positions have been sanctioned for continuation to the end of
the planning cycle, many of those positions, particularly at central level, were not filled or are
now vacant. If the NVBDCP and the states do not take a pro-active stance with respect to
recruitment and retention the positions may remain vacant.



                                               28
The simplification of reporting and reporting forms for malaria control and the establishment of
sentinel sites for monitoring malaria morbidity and mortality have been important contributions
of the project to monitoring and evaluation for vector borne disease control. Less progress has
been made in automating the reporting system and integrating malaria and kala azar monitoring
and evaluation with other health statistics. The project also initiated a culture of using LQAS for
monitoring implementation at the district level. Although most stakeholders see value in in
sentinel sites and local use of LQAS, it is unclear for how long and how broadly these practices
will be maintained. Sentinel sites may be more durable as they are clearly part of a nation-wide
system. Local use of LQAS is already quite variable across states and districts, and although
popular where it has been used, without a champion and dedicated funding its usage may decline.
Additional information is provided in section 2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

N/A

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Although there were no beneficiary surveys of stakeholder workshops held as part of the ICR or
project assessment, the ICR mission corresponded to the 2014 Joint Monitoring Mission by the
National Vector Borne Disease Control Program and the World Health Organization (JMM 2014).
The previous joint monitoring mission took place in 2007 with Bank participation and informed
the design of the project.

The JMM took place from 1 – 10 March 2014. The objectives were: to review technical policies
and strategies in light of global policies and best practices; to assess the program implementation
against targets defined in National Strategic Plan (NSP), Results Framework Document (RFP)
and National Health Policy (NHP 2002); to assess the effectiveness of NVBDCP strategies on
control, elimination and/or reduction in disease burden; and to formulate recommendations in
order to move towards achieving the targets envisaged in National Health Policy 2002 and MDGs
by 2015 and sustain these in the post 2015 agenda.

The JMM 2014 involved meetings with stakeholders, program implementers and beneficiaries
through consultations in Delhi and visits to 7 states and 14 districts across India. The JMM report
is presently in draft stage; however, preliminary findings related to malaria control, kala azar
elimination and health systems are referenced throughout the ICR. In general, the JMM 2014
concluded that for malaria and kala azar, progress has been made in decreasing the disease burden,
particularly through improved diagnosis and treatment at community level. Some progress in
vector control has been made, but the roll out of LLINs has been far from adequate and
significant challenges still exist with respect to the quality, acceptability and coverage of IRS.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Negligible-Low

The GoI is highly committed to controlling malaria, eliminating kala azar and preventing
reintroduction of polio virus to India. Malaria, kala azar and other vector borne diseases are
within the purview of the National Health Mission (NHM), a flagship program of Ministry of
Health mandated to provide accessible, affordable and quality health care to the rural and
vulnerable populations. NVBDCP under the overall architecture of NHM is financed by



                                                29
domestic budget support (DBS) and external aid component (EAC). Under NHM, there has been
an increase in domestic financing for the disease control program and the budget allocation for
NVBDCP has also increased proportionally. Malaria has been highlighted as one of the top
development challenges under the 12th Five Year Plan (2012–2017) and the GoI has committed
to supporting key positions at central and state level as well as the cadres of workers (VBD
consultants, malaria and kala azar technical superviors) supported by the project and the NHM
will continue to support the multi-purpose health workers and the accredited social health
activists (ASHA) at block and community level. In many districts, District VBD Control
Societies (under NRHM) have been established to assist with management of funds and planning
and monitoring of program activities. States developed a stronger sense of ownership and
capacities at central and districts levels have been enhanced to continue the program. EAC for
malaria has been fairly limited with financial support primarily from the World Bank and the
Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria and there is some risk that progress in reducing the
burden of malaria could stall in the absence of adequate external funding. Kala azar elimination
appears to be less vulnerable due to a high level of interest in disease elimination by stakeholders
and external financing partners such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. High quality
technical support for malaria control and kala azar elimination continues to be provided by the
WHO. The JMM 2014 will provide confirmation of the technical soundness of the disease
control approaches rolled out under the project as well as guidance and recommendations on
technical strategies going forward. Having eliminated polio from India the GoI is committed to
preventing reintroduction of the virus from neighboring polio endemic countries and has
established vaccination posts along India’s international borders.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The Bank team worked closely with the GoI and development partners, particularly the World
Health Organization (WHO), to develop a technically sound and ambitious project that
incorporated lessons learned from previous investment lending for malaria control, the findings of
an in depth review of vector borne disease control in India (JMM 2007), and international best
practices for malaria control and kala azar elimination. The project was designed to fast track
implementation of significant changes in disease control policy and build on increasing domestic
investment in community level service delivery under the NRHM. During the preparation period
the project benefitted from both a Quality Enhancement Review (QER) and an Operation
Committee (OC) Review which helped the project team to narrow the geographic scope of the
project and focus on malaria and kala azar as priority public health problems. The addition of a
polio component late in the preparation of the project (during negotiations and without a full
appraisal) added to the complexity and risks associated with the project. It also added
significantly to the budget, more than doubling the cost of the project. The OC review of the
Appraisal Decision Meeting Package noted that the project represented both a high opportunity
and high risk for the Bank’s HNP program in India.

As has been noted throughout the document, the project design was strongly influenced by the
DIR and subsequent agreements between the Bank and the GoI. The conduct of the DIR and the
subsequent development of a joint action plan between the MoHFW and the Bank contributed to
the prolonged project preparation period and set the tone for project design and development.


                                                30
The Bank and the Borrower took a very risk-averse approach to project design in an inherently
high risk context. This resulted in very prescriptive implementation arrangements particularly
concerning procurement and financial management, restrictions on decentralized costs and
expenditures, district readiness filters and project phasing. The project lacked, or was perceived
to lack, flexibility and in certain respects was “over-designed”. Monitoring and evaluation is one
aspect of the project that has been highlighted as ambitious and overly complex, requiring
multiple tools and approaches and the triangulation of data from different sources. Given the
various innovations being promoted within the project (new diagnostic and treatment policies,
new service delivery models, the introduction of standard costs for decentralized expenses, large
country LQAS and population-based household surveys) the project needed to provide space for
some risk taking by the implementing agency, but the implementation arrangements, coupled
with lingering concerns about fraud and corruption, promoted risk averse behavior, caution
and inaction. This included prolongation and cancellation of procurement processes;
overly narrow definition of decentralized costs and significant delays in response to
implementing partner proposal.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The task team carried out regular and in-depth bi-annual supervision missions, including site
visits to states, districts and communities. The Bank team made a concerted effort to engage
other development partners, including DFID, the WHO, the Global Fund and the Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation, in supervision missions in order to incorporate a broader set of
observations and perspectives and expand the number of states and districts visited during each
mission. In addition, implementation support missions to states were conducted between
supervision missions when needed and there was frequent contact with the NVBDCP and key
development partners and stakeholders such as CARE, MSF and DNDI to track implementation
progress and challenges on a more day to day basis. Detailed Aides-Memoires with specific
action points were generated during each mission and were presented to and discussed with the
implementing agency and of state and national level officials at the highest level.
Continuity in task team membership was fairly high. There was only one change in TTL that
occurred just prior to the mid-term review of the project. The TTL transition, however, was fairly
abrupt for such a large and complex project. No formal handover notes were prepared or
transmitted and for a period of approximately six months an acting TTL bridged the gap between
the outgoing and incoming TTLs. There were smooth transitions between two social safeguards
specialists and two financial management specialists. The procurement, environmental and
monitoring and evaluation specialists on the team did not change during the life of the project.
Technical support for LQAS was available during project preparation, but not implementation.
This resulted in a lack of continuity in support for Large Country LQAS (as part of the M&E
plan) in particular. Given the size and complexity of this project and high periodic and day-to day
demands on Bank staff the investment in supervision by the Bank, including number and location
of staff may have been overly lean

One observation on the quality of supervision is the apparent disconnect between the project
implementation and project ratings. Even when the project processed the first cancellations of
funds and could not document progress against two of the PDO level indicators due to the
absence of survey results, the team still maintained “moderately satisfactory” DO, IP,
Procurement, Financial Management and M&E ratings almost until project closure. While the



                                                   31
ratings remained above the line, the task team did not fail to observe or to document the
challenges encountered during the project including chronic delays in in the procurement of
goods, such as LLIN, or the contracting/outsourcing of critical services – particularly the external
implementation and fiduciary reviews and the baseline, mid-term and end-line household surveys.
However the mission Aides Memoires, upon which the ISR ratings were based, were consistently
optimistic suggesting that the challenges documented were being resolved or on the cusp of being
resolved. This optimism appears to have been a consequence of three factors: 1) strong
assurances from the client at all levels that the challenges were being aggressively addressed. The
team was continually expected procurement to turn around, even until the supervision mission in
July 2013; 2) routine epidemiological program data that indicated downward trends in morbidity
and mortality for malaria and kala azar; and 3) the very inclusive nature of supervision mentioned
above (by aligning so many stakeholders with an interest in the ultimate success of the project to
the supervision process some of the Bank’s objectivity may have been lost). Additionally, the
satisfactory performance of the polio component, particularly with respect to procurement, seems
to have been overly weighted compared to the less than satisfactory performance of the VBD
components in the summary ratings. Ratings were still moderately satisfactory as reported in the
July 2013 supervision mission Aide-Memoire and were only down-graded in the second to last
project ISR (November 2013) when it was clear that a second cancellation of financing for
malaria commodities would be required and there was very little likelihood of a follow-up
household survey being conducted. This was not the case for either environmental or social
safeguards where the ratings varied according to performance during the period under review and
which are more consistent with the story of progress and challenges as documented.  The
summary of ISR ratings is provided in the table below.

The consistent use of the MS rating may have masked the seriousness and chronic nature of some
of the difficulties encountered during the implementation of the project. As a result, the search
for solutions, the purpose and scope of restructuring exercises and the attention of senior
management may have been less than optimal.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Overall Bank performance, which includes project preparation, supervision and evaluation, is
rated as moderately unsatisfactory. Although the level of effort invested in project preparation



                                                32
and supervision was extremely high the project was very complex and ambitious and suffered
from chronic shortcomings that were not sufficiently appreciated through much of the
implementation period.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The strong commitment of the GoI to health in general, the establishment of the NHM with its
mandate to focus on the most vulnerable populations and their priority health concerns, and the
standing commitment to eradicate polio provided and enabling environment in which to launch
the National Vector Borne Disease Control and Polio Eradication Project. The successes to
which the project contributed, including polio eradication and the delivery of effective diagnostic
and treatment services for malaria and kala azar at the community level, were largely dependent
on the continuous commitment of the GoI and domestic investment in polio eradication and the
strengthening of health systems and health manpower, particularly at the community level, under
the NHM. However the GoI, at the level of the MoHFW, was unable to provide adequate
stewardship to the project as evidenced by delays in approvals and decisions which affected
project implementation. This includes a fairly broad array of issues including pesticide product
registration processes, procurement clearances, decision-taking on implementation support
proposals from contractors, communication and support to states, prioritization of monitoring and
evaluation activities; and the resolution of pay parity issues within the NHM. Key informants
have indicated that many of the procedural constraints and delays at the level of the government
and the implementing agencies, particularly with respect to procurement and contracting actions
were due to risk adverse behaviors and concerns about personal association with fraud and
corruption allegations in the wake of the DIR and the context of concerns about the subsequent
allegations of the misuse of government funds associated with preparation of the 2010
Commonwealth Games in India.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory.

The performance of the National Polio Eradication Program was Satisfactory, as evidenced by the
certification of India as polio-free in March 2014. Although 32% of the Bank financing for OPV
was cancelled, the financing was replaced from domestic sources and there was no detrimental
impact on OPV supply, program implementation, outcome or impact.

The performance of the National Vector Borne Disease Control Program was Unsatisfactory,
despite some notable progress in the diagnosis and treatment of malaria and kala azar. The
NVBDCP was not adequately equipped or staffed throughout the project period to fulfill all of its
normative functions as defined under the project or provide the necessary leadership to address
the multiple implementation challenges that arose during project implementation in an effective
or timely manner. The NVBDCP never achieved full staffing of the key central level positions
financed under the project and many remained vacant for extended periods. With the exception
of a brief period in 2010 the program directorate did not take a notably proactive approach to
addressing delays and bottlenecks which ultimately resulted in the cancellation of 68% of bank
financing for vector borne diseases control, poor coverage of LLINs and inadequate
documentation of the malaria-related PDO and intermediate outcome indicators. Despite
repeated assurances, the mid-term end of project population based household surveys were not
contracted and clear evidence of project impact is not available.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory

Moderately Unsatisfactory ratings for government performance and the Unsatisfactory rating for
the implementing agency result in an overall borrower performance rating of Unsatisfactory.


6. Lessons Learned

1) Community-based service delivery models can work. This project has contributed further
evidence that community-based health workers with limited training can effectively manage
biological confirmation and treatment of malaria and kala-azar and contribute to epidemiologic
and program monitoring. Investment by the GoI through the NRMH in building the cadres of
MPW and ASHA to deliver essential health interventions to populations with poor social,
geographic or economic access to publicly provided health services has provided a strong
platform for the introduction of RDTs and new treatments for malaria and kala azar at the
community level. As many other malaria endemic countries are beginning to introduce or scale
up community case management (CCM) the example from India , which has several distinctly
successful and replicable features, is timely. The project included impact evaluation research
which assessed the introduction of CCM through deployment of community health workers. This
paper shows that directed investments in community health workers can feasibly shift care-
seeking behavior by improving the perceived quality of the lay provider. The results highlight
how community mobilization and supportive supervision can improve utilization and delivery of
malaria diagnosis and treatment.

2) The introduction of innovations requires a high level of capacity building for the implementing
agency and financing for external technical support within the project budget. The project
introduced several innovations including Large Country LQAS as a monitoring and evaluation
tool and the Standard Costs Approach for disbursement of project funds for decentralized costs.
These were important opportunities for project learning; however neither of these innovations
was adequately implemented and evaluated due to the implementing agency’s weak capacity in
M&E and financial management at central level and the absence of continuous external technical
support or a planned formal evaluation of the tools themselves.


3) Operational research can have a very positive impact on policy and practice. By incorporating
routine drug and insecticide resistance monitoring, batch testing of rapid diagnostic tests,
pharmaco-vigilance and impact evaluation into the M&E framework for the project, new data
were continually being generated for consideration by technical experts, state-level and national
authorities. As has previously been noted, this provided confidence in the use of newly
introduced diagnostic technologies and treatment regimens and the capacity of community health
workers to conduct CCM. In the case of malaria drug efficacy monitoring resulted in a change in
ACT treatment policy from co-packaged artesunate and sufadoxine pyrimethamine (AS-SP) to
co-formulated artemether-lumefantrin (AL) in states with increasing levels of resistance to SP.


4) Client assurances with respect to the recruitment of human resources to address capacity
constraints are not an adequate substitute for thorough assessment of past performance and the
market for key skill sets. As has been noted recruitment and retention were major challenges



                                               34
during implementation particularly at central and state level. This was identified as a substantial
risk during project preparation and a more in depth assessment of past performance and the labor
market may have helped identify problems such as non-competitive compensation packages and
the absence of specific skill sets, potentially leading to a different approach to capacity building
and/or risk mitigation measures.

5) Substantive alterations to projects late in the preparation process should be avoided. Although
the polio component of the project contributed to the elimination of polio in India, there was not
adequate opportunity for appraisal of the component which may have led to an overestimation of
the required budget.

6) Monitoring and evaluation needs to be given highest priority. The delay in implementation of
the baseline population based household survey and the complete absence of mid-term and end of
project survey data for comparison is clearly not acceptable. Projects need controls in place to
ensure that key monitoring and evaluation activities are conducted in a timely manner. This may

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The Economic and Financial Analysis conducted during project preparation focused primarily on
the evidence base concerning the cost effectiveness of the interventions to be financed by the
project and an estimate of the costs and benefits of introducing the new diagnosis and treatment
protocols for malaria and kala azar.

VECTOR BORNE DISEASE CONTROL: For the vector borne disease control objectives, the
overall efficiency rating is low primarily due to implementation performance; however, there are
some examples of good practices within the project that enhanced technical and or allocative
efficiency.

At the time of preparation, there were a number of influential reviews of the cost effectiveness of
malaria control, many of which were cited in the project appraisal document. A fairly exhaustive
review of the evidence associated with the cost effectiveness of malaria control interventions was
published in 2000 by the Global Forum for Health Research. The central message from this
analysis was that all of the malaria control interventions evaluated would be an attractive use of
resources. In subsequent years, the interventions—already established as cost-effective—have
been subject to continuous improvements to promote more effective use, reduce costs and
improve the cost-effectiveness ratio.

Kala azar, a disease that affects the poorest segments of rural populations wherever it is found,
was considered in the economic analysis for its economic burden, particularly on poor rural
households, and the cost effectiveness of kala azar treatment which compares favorably to other
public health interventions in terms of the cost per death and disability adjusted life year averted.

The analysis in the PAD estimated and compared the costs and benefits of the then current
protocols for malaria control and kala azar elimination with the costs and benefits of a phased
transition to the new protocols and concluded that the transition would produce significant net
incremental economic benefits over the five year period of approximately 4,389 million rupees.
Unfortunately, a similar analysis based on observed data and actual costs was not conducted at
the end of the project.

In the absence of these data, the ICR team looked for other evidence of efficacy in the context of
project implementation and concludes that the overall efficacy of the VBD components of the
project is low, despite the documented cost effectiveness of the project interventions.

At very few points in time were goods, personnel, training and other services adequately aligned
which resulted in fairly profound inefficiencies in project implementation and constrained the
impact of the project. Some examples include the very limited coverage of LLIN in the target
population because the borrower was unable to procure the commodity; the recruitment and
training of staff to implement activities that were not adequately supported with required
commodities (such as ACTs for the treatment of malaraia and Miltefosine for kala azar), while in
other instances interventions could not be delivered or activities conducted because of the high
level of staff vacancies.

There were nonetheless some examples of good practice that enhanced the allocative and/or
technical efficiency of project implementation.
     A cost-effective response was taken to the severe and chronic shortage of LLIN. In other
        settings, when there have not been enough LLINs to cover the entire target population at


                                                 40
        the designate level (often 80% of households or universal coverage), the coverage target
        has been lowered to ensure equal access to the entire at risk population. However, such
        an approach is not technically optimal. When LLIN coverage is high even people
        without nets in that community are protected from malaria. At lower levels of coverage
        there is no community protective effect and only those persons sleeping under the LLIN
        are protected from malaria. The program chose to maximize the potential benefits of
        LLIN and targeted communities with the highest malaria cases and only those for which
        they could provide high coverage.
       Proper management of expiry of drug stocks at General Medical Store Depots (GMSD),
        state and district levels. Regular monitoring of short-expiry drugs and other supplies was
        implemented at all levels so that these commodities could be shifted to destinations with
        low stock and high demand to ensure utilization of close to expiry items within available
        shelf life. 138 episodes of shifting short-expiry drugs and other supplies were
        documented. Had this not occurred those drugs and commodities would have been
        destroyed or inappropriately used after expiry.
       Routine monitoring of therapeutic efficacy (to detect drug resistance) was conducted of
        the new drugs (primarily ACTs) introduced by the Program. For example, decreasing
        therapeutic efficacy of the co-blistered ACT combining artesunate and sufadoxine-
        pyrimethamine (AS+AQ) was detected in malaria endemic states in the north-east and the
        treatment protocol was changed to co-formulated artemether-lumefantrine (AL) in
        response, improving the technical efficacy of malaria treatment in those states.
       Systematic quality assurance of RDTs was undertaken, particularly important during the
        earlier years of the project when there was significant quality variance between products
        as well as batches, was able to detect and eliminate from use, poorly performing batches
        of tests.


POLIO: Public financing of polio eradication is considered well justified using standard public
financing criteria. The eradication of polio is considered a global public good and the benefits of
[Global] eradication are infinite. The project contributed to the India program at a critical point
in the disease elimination process and the contribution was simple and focused and responded to
a specific need (availability of an adequate supply of three types of OPV). During the project, a
change in procurement agent for vaccines did result in cost savings while maintaining adherence
to WHO pre-qualification requirements.

                                     Executive Summary

World Bank supported project “National Vector Borne Disease Control Support Project” for
Malaria control and Kala-azar (KA) elimination was approved and signed by the Government of
India and the World Bank for a period of five years from 2008-09 to 2012-2013. The Financing
agreement was signed on 6th March, 2009. The project is to support NVBDCP to implement
evidence based interventions for malaria control and elimination of kala-azar in districts with
highest burden of these diseases in a phased manner. Some new initiatives have been taken up
under the project for the control and management of two vector-borne diseases: malaria and kala-
azar. The Polio component supported procurement of oral polio vaccines required for high
coverage of eligible children under supplemental national and sub-national polio immunization
rounds in the country.

Project Objectives (Malaria)

The Objective of the project is to:
    Reduce Malaria morbidity by 25% by 2013 ( Base Year 2007)
    Reduce Malaria mortality by 50% by 2013 ( Base Year 2007); &
    Achieve Kala-azar elimination by 2015

Project Components (malaria): The project has four components:

Component 1: Improving Access to and Use of Services for Control of Malaria: This component
includes the following sub-components:
     Improving Malaria Case Management;
     Strengthening Malaria Surveillance; and
     Effective Vector Control

Component 2: Improving Access to and Use of Services for Elimination of Kala-azar: This
component includes the following subcomponents:
    Improving Kala Azar Case Management;
    Strengthening Kala Azar Surveillance; and
    Effective Vector Control;

Component 3: Policy and Strategy Development, Capacity Building, Monitoring and Evaluation:
This component includes the following sub-components:
     Policy and Strategy Development;


                                              45
       Program Management and Capacity Building; and
       Monitoring and Evaluation.

The project has been implemented in two phases. In Phase I, the project started supporting since
2009, Malaria control & Kala-azar elimination activities in 50 malarious districts of five states
namely Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Orissa; and 46 Kala-azar
districts in three states namely Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal.

From 3rd year, Phase-II had been implemented in remaining 43 malaria districts of Gujarat,
Karnataka & Maharashtra after approval from the World Bank. It was requested to the World
Bank to include 30 districts of Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal which were covered earlier
under the Intensified Malaria Control Project-I supported by Rd.4 of Global Fund till June 2010
and one district (Adilabad) of Andhra Pradesh which is in tribal area and is having problem of
malaria. The World Bank approved the proposal and accordingly, they were included in the Phase
II of the Project after assessment for district readiness. Thus, the project had been implemented in
a total of 124 districts of 9 states.

District implementation plan was prepared by all project districts using a model action plan. The
key components of which are case management, integrated vector management, logistics control
and capacity building and sensitization of CBOs. The assessment for District readiness for
implementation of World Bank supported implementation plan was carried out in a phased
manner in Phase I districts in 2009 and for newly included Phase II districts in 2011. The project
was implemented in all the certified districts. The World Bank missions have also reviewed
periodically (every six monthly) the progress of the project activities. During the project period,
seven missions have reviewed the progress of the project.

Capacity Building: Under the project, the capacity building has been taken up as a major
component. A country wide training programme was undertaken in collaboration with NIHFW to
train the faculty of medical colleges in VBD control programme activities.
          40 zonal medical colleges were involved in the training which imparted training to
             regional medical colleges and district level officials with the result that a rich
             resource of Master trainers at district/ zonal and state level has been created which
             will be helpful in imparting future training to the personnel involved in VBD control
             programme.
          District VBD Consultants of the project states were trained in batches of 25 at
             various central institutes like NIMR, PHFI, NCDC and RMRC
          MTSs were trained at ROHFW, Bhubaneshwar, Patna and other training institutes
          District VBD officers were trained at NCDC Delhi in 2 batches
          Besides, MOs and other health field staff were trained at state/ District and sub-
             district levels by the trained staff of the programme and faculty from other research
             institutions
District Readiness Assessment for Implementation of World Bank supported NVBDCP: A
standard protocol for processes and certification to assure district level readiness for NVBDC
project implementation was agreed between NVBDCP and the World Bank. All 124 districts
have been certified as ready for implementation from the date of the visit of the team.
Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT): Rapid diagnostic kits have been introduced at community level
(ASHAs & other health workers) for quick diagnosis of P.falciparum malaria. ASHAs in the
project districts have been trained for using RDT for diagnosis and slide preparation. Guidelines
for the use of RDT in the field were given to the states from the NVBDCP. Record is maintained
by the ASHA in M-ASHA register and performance based incentive has been provisioned for the
services provided by them. The programme has introduced bivalent RDT kits from 2012 as
majority of the Phase II districts are Pv predominant. A total of 240.97 Lakhs of RDT Kits for
Malaria and a total of 28.06 Lakhs of ACT Combi Blister Packs have been supplied in the
World Bank States till the year 2010-11.

Artimisinine Combination Therapy (ACT): All confirmed P.falciparum cases diagnosed by
rapid diagnostic kits (RDK) or by malaria microscopy in districts under the project are being
treated with effective Artemisinin-based combination Therapy (ACT). The programme is using at
present Artesunate + Sulphadoxine + Pyrimethamine combination and as it is still very effective;
the programme has not introduced other ACT combinations. However, four combinations are at
present approved by the DGC (I) in India. From 2010ACT has been recommended as first line of
treatment of all Pf cases in the country including project districts.

Long Lasting Insecticide Nets (LLINs): The project has envisaged introduction of LLINs in
most endemic inaccessible malaria areas where IRS operation is difficult. In 2009, 1 million
LLINs have been supplied to the states. 5.18 million LLINs (Planned under 2009-10 and10-11)
have also been supplied to Project states /districts (of Phase I) and distributed to the beneficiaries
along with appropriate IEC/BCC activities. Its use will be monitored through local level field
workers and through LQAS. The procurement of 11 million LLINs (Under 11-12 and 12-13) is in


                                                 47
process. It has been delayed due to various reasons. A total of 75.28 Lakhs have been procured
and supplied in the World Bank States out of which 75.12 Lakhs have been distributed from
states to districts by covering 52 districts and achieving 97% target of the LLIN distribution.

Monitoring: With the technical support from the World Bank the existing recording and
reporting (M&E) system was revised. New record keeping and reporting formats were developed
for case management activity and the vector control activities.             These formats were
communicated to the states and are being implemented by the states. At the National level, the
effort to make functional the web-based NAMMIS was made with the support of Tata
Consultancy Service. However, the response at the implementation level by the states was not
encouraging. The Government is planned to integrate the VBD reporting system with the HMIS -
reporting system under NRHM. The format for reporting through HMIS by the District
Programme Management Unit has been designed and is now uploaded on the HMIS of NRHM.
After due training it will be made functional. However the data available will be of district level.
So the states have been requested to use the NAMMIS for sub-center wise data entry.
For monitoring of programme implementation at micro-level i.e at sub-district level, Lot Quality
Assurance Sampling (LQAS) method is used by MTS for assessing the progress of impact of the
project. The training of first batch of MTS for use of LQAS was completed in Orissa during 19th
to 22nd October, 2009. A Pilot study of its use was carried out in Orissa with the technical
support of DFID. Based on its observation necessary changes in the formats were made. Varying
rounds of LQAS have been implemented in different states based on capacity and local problems.
(MP have done data collection in eight rounds, Odisha in four rounds, Jharkhand Chhattsisgarh in
three rounds and AP in six rounds). The results of the same are used at the local level for
identification of weak areas. This method is also being used in GF supported IMCP project areas
and it is one of the important indicators to be reported semi-annually. The state level trainers of
IMCP states were also trained along with the trainers of the WB project states. It is a good
example of ‘good practice’ of one project being extended in another project in the country. The
district VBD officers and the Consultants are involved in monitoring and validation of data
collection at the field level. The modules have been revised to include any missing indicator or to
obtain data on new indicators.

Monitoring and Evaluation has been strengthened by providing effective supervision and
surveillance by involvement of ASHA and MPW at ground level. Besides the newly recruited
KTS/ MTS, VBD Consultants and District/state officials regularly visit the field for better
supervision of the disease control activities. They have a monthly schedule of mandatory visits
which is submitted to the district/state officials in advance and visits are conducted as per the
schedule.

The district malaria officers and CMOs/CMHOs conduct monthly review meeting at district
Headquarter and the state officials also participate in that meeting. The state also conducts
monthly/ quarterly review meeting at state Headquarters wherein the representatives from
Directorate of NVBDCP also participate and programme implementation activities are reviewed.
For regular assessment of programme implementation activities and its impact, 6 monthly lot
quality Assurance Sampling survey is conducted at block level, which is used as a tool for
assessment of performance and for taking corrective actions at local level. At Directorate of
NVBDCP, regular disease-wise review meetings are held for monitoring the programme at
National level and taking corrective measure as and when needed. In all project districts, Sentinel
Site Hospitals have been identified which provide data on the trend of diseases in the community
and severity of illness which helps in taking decisions for specific causes. Every 6 months,
project is reviewed by World Bank review mission team consisting of World Bank officials,
International representative of various bilateral organizations. During this mission, extensive field


                                                 48
visit is also done through pre-mission visits by World Bank and NVBDCP teams for assessing
ground level status of implementation activities. NAMMIS: data recording and reporting is
strengthened by introduction of web-based MIS called NAMMIS. Efforts have been made to
operationalize NAMMIS throughout the country.


Mobility Support
            a. Motor bikes to the MTS
            b. Vehicles to DMOs (Tata Safari) to facilitate supervisory field visits and better
                monitoring of programme implementation activities.
            c. Budgetary provision for POL to the project activities for extra field activities.

Sentinel sites: Two sentinel sites have been identified in all the project districts and Lab.
Technicians (LTs) are provided for strengthening the diagnosis services at sentinel sites. Module
including the guidelines for sentinel sites was developed with the technical support from the
World Bank and WHO. This included a recording and reporting system for the sentinel sites.
Based on this Module, Pilot training of SSMO and LTs was conducted in Orissa. This experience
was expanded in the second year in other project districts. The states of Madhya Pradesh and
Orissa have regularly started monitoring the reporting form these sentinel sites. Other states are in
process of making those centres fully functional and now they have also started receiving regular
reporting from these centres in 2012. The sentinel sites have also been made functional in
districts involved in Phase II. So far out of 348 identified Sentinel sites under World Bank
supported project states, 331 sites are functional and 303 sites are reporting to the concern state
officials.

Development of operational manual for programme manager & updating of existing
training modules: An exhaustive Operation manual (2009) for the programme was developed
with the technical support from the World Bank. The existing training module for Medical
Officers and MPWs were also revised to include the new initiatives in the module. As MTS and
ASHAs have been included in the project / programme, a training module for both of these cadres
was developed. Recently, the Caritas India which is a project partner in GF supported IMCP-II
project has helped in developing the revised ASHA module and the guide for facilitator. For
newly recruited VBD consultants, a VBD training module was developed with the help of PHFI,
NCDC, NIMR for their 3 months training by PHFI at Delhi. The 3 months training for the first
batch of 26 Distt. VBD Consultants was completed during September to December 2009 at PHFI.
The 2nd batch training of 23 VBD Consultants was completed during November, 2010 to
January, 2011 by PHFI. The 10-days MTS training was completed at RMRC (ICMR)
Bhubaneshwar for the first Phase I districts. The training for the VBD consultants for the newly
included districts has been done with the help of NIMR and NCDC from June 2012 in two
batches. The trainings for MTSs of the Phase II districts are being organized at regional levels in
different states with the help of NIMR and ROHFW. Status of manpower and their training is
given in the chapter of Human Resources.

Operational research activities of rapid assessment of Artemisinin monotherapy, baseline
Household survey, monitoring of therapeutic efficacy, insecticide resistance, pharmaco-vigilance
exclusively focusing on side effects of drugs, quality assurance of rapid kits and household
survey were entrusted to NIMR for malaria in the year 2008-09. NIMR has completed the studies
of rapid assessment of Artemisinin monotherapy and the baseline household survey and
submitted the reports. Remaining studies are undergoing at NIMR through its 15 field stations
scattered throughout the country and their progress reports are submitted regularly at the


                                                 49
NVBDCP and are periodically reviewed. Operation research studies on alternative ACT drugs are
also being conducted by the NIMR. The status of OR studies is given in other document.

   Status of malaria cases and deaths during 2007-13 in the Phase II(74) districts is as follows:




                                                                        Kala-azar

1.1. Objective
The Kala zaar set for elimination by 2015 i.e reducing the number of KA cases less than one per
10 thousand population.
     1. To reduce Kala azar cases
     2. To reduce the case fatality
     3. Sustain the achievement

1.2. Epidemiological trends
The State of Bihar contributes about 80% of the total disease burden of the country. In Bihar, 9
districts out of 31 districts contribute between 65-70% of Kala-azar case.




                                                                         52
2. Capacity Building:
      Capacity building is an integral and important component of any disease control
       programme. For strengthening the programme components in the field mainly the
       surveillance and complete treatment, Kala-azar Technical Supervisors (KTS) were
       provided to three endemic states for above purposes. This provision necessitated
       increasing the technical capacities of these supervisors and therefore the training
       programmes on all aspects of Kala-azar elimination programme were organised at
       State/district/block levels.

      A total of 183 KTS from the three states trained by RMRI, Patna (Bihar - 149, WB - 16
       & Jharkhand -18) for 10 days during 2011. 23 KTS from West Bengal were trained in
       May 2013.

      26 VBD Consultants have been imparted 3 months training by RMRI Patna and PHFI
       from 17th Jan to 16th April 2011. Another batch of untrained VBD (21), Consultants
       training is scheduled was schedule in October/ November 2013 but could not be done due
       to spray activities during that period. Now proposed in middle of 2014 after completion
       of 2nd round IRS activities in the states.

3. Diagnostics, Drugs & Insecticide:
       All the KA endemic districts are being provided free rapid diagnostic kits and first line
       drug Miltefosine and second line drug Amphoterecin B injection. Both drug and
       diagnostics are available upto block level. DDT 50% insecticide is being provided by
       Govt of India free of cost to all endemic states during indoor residual spray.
       Seeing the long duration of treatment of 28 days with Miltefosine and treatment
       compliance, the expert committee suggested short duration of treatment in the
       programme in August 2013 with the flowing combination:

               i)       Miltefosine + Paromomycin for 10 days at block level
               ii)      Ambisome injection single dose at district /referral /medical college.




                                               53
              At present introduced in seven identified districts and shall be expanded in all the
             districts in phased manner. States are in process for purchasing of drugs. RMRI,DNDi,
             MSF is helping the resource mobilisation, training and updating heath system.

     4. Indoor Residual Spray:
            During 2012, two round Indoor Residual spray with DDT 50% was carried out in all
               the three Kala-azar endemic states covering a population of 38.37 million for 1st
               round and in the 2nd Round spray with DDT covering 27.61 million populations.
            In 2013 all the states have completed first and second round of IRS Central teams
               from NVBDCP, NCDC, RMRI, Regional office visited the Kala-azar endemic area
               for supervision and Monitoring.
            28 districts were covered for IRS quality by central teams consisting officers from
               NVBDCP, NCDC, RMRI, Patna and RD Office Patna. The overall observations of
               the visiting team have indicated moderate coverage of IRS during both the rounds;
               the PPE has been used by the spray teams for IRS. However the quality of spray was
               not very good though districts have made efforts to cover as many rooms for larger
               impact of IRS. The problem of leakage of pumps, lack of supervision and monitoring
               on the part of district authorities have been noted, the efforts on the part of IEC has
               been done by many districts.
            As done in 2012, training of trainers on IRS by M/s. Hindustan Insecticides Ltd the
               was also done in 2013 (before 1st round) in Bihar involving district VBD officers,
               VBD Consultants.

     5. Incentives:
             Rs. 200/- as incentives to ASHA/Health Volunteer for referring a suspected case and
                ensuing complete treatment.
             Loss of wages @ Rs. 50/- per day to the confirmed case of kala-azar during the entire
                period of treatment.
             Free diet to the patients and one attendant during treatment period.

     6. Endemicity of Kala-azar (Per 10,000 Population at block level)
         The table below shows that nos. of blocks showing <1 per 10,000 population has been
         increased in 2012 in comparison with 2011. The reason attributed is better case detection and
         complete treatment. In 2011 against 584 blocks 309 blocks (53%) have reported cases <1 per
         10,000 population. In 2012 out of 579 blocks 342 block (59%) have reported cases <1 per
         10,000 population.

7.       Initiatives

           The reporting formats for recording Kala-azar cases vary from district to district and state
            to state. A necessity was felt for developing a uniform Health Management Information
            System (HMIS). One such meeting held at Siliguri on 16th -17th October 2012 involving
            SPOs of three KA states, DMOs, Consultants for discussion on five proformas/formats
            developed by NVBDCP with the help of World Bank Consultant. The piloting in two
            districts (Saharsa & Madhepura-Bihar), (Sahibganj & Pakur – Jharkhand) and (Malda and
            Darjeelling – West Bengal) has completed. Dte. has developed online software for
            capturing the data with the help of CARE which is now completed and shortly the HMIS
            shall be rolled out in the country.




                                                    54
     Programme has also carried out situation analysis on KA prevalence on the facilities
      available and the man power situation in the state of Bihar in 2012-13. The preliminary
      analysis indicates that there is no great difference between the epidemiology on the
      ground and that reported in the programme. About 30% of the suspected cases contact the
      private sector and most returned to the public health facilities and ultimately only 4% are
      seeking treatment exclusively by the private sectors i.e. 96% cases are going to public
      health facilities.
     Mobile phone with IRS apps provided to District VBD Officer on day to day reporting
      activities on IRS.
     State Health Mission, Bihar has taken a decision to provide mobile phone to ASHAs.
     Hindustan Insecticides Ltd. services are being utilised for quality training of Indoor
      Residual Spray to the trainers. In 2013 HIL has imparted training to trainers DMOs,
      BMO, VBD Consultant and supervisors at Patna. The training held in 2012 has given
      dividends and the quality of spray has improved.
     Voluntary Health Organisation representatives for strengthening social mobilization and
      service delivery for improving the implementation activities and involvement of new
      concept- an agency hired by NVBDCP for developing IEC /BCC materials on Kala-azar
      including training.

8. Involvement of Stakeholders

       There are multiple challenges affecting the KA elimination program particularly in the
       state of Bihar including underreporting of cases and deaths, lack of awareness in the
       community, no quality monitoring of Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS), prolonged duration
       of treatment, PKDL (post Kala Azar Dermal Leishmaniasis) cases, TB co-infected cases,
       weak referral system and no proper active case search.

       Seeing the gravity of the problem some of the potential partners have come forward to
       work with the Govt. health system in the field to improve access to and use of services
       for elimination of Kala-azar, expanding the effectiveness, reach and visibility of Kala
       Azar elimination efforts through IEC/ BCC, Community mobilization and Civil Society
       support and improving Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) in endemic blocks of the project.
       The Partners are: MSF; DNDi & RMRI; BHU
           1. BMGF (CARE, PATH, DFID, World Health Partners (WHP)

       Coalition for Strengthening Kala Azar Elimination Project (CSKAEP): This is the new
       initiative taken by CARE with support from the Bill Mellinda Gates Foundation (BMGF)
       along with stakeholders like B-TAST (DFID), PATH, RMRI, State Malaria Office,
       CBOs and private sector like World Health Forum to bring various stakeholders
       (state/govt. and NGOs) on one platform to improve access to and use of services for
       elimination of KA, reach & visibility efforts through IEC/BCC, community mobilization
       and Civil Society support, improving IRS coverage in project (8 districts in Bihar). This
       coalition has held two meetings in December 2012 and April 2013. The purpose of this
       coalition is to increase awareness of and promote Kala Azar elimination strategies for
       informed choices by all stakeholders.


       Objectives of the Coalition:

       CARE Patna branch has hired 68 link volunteers at district level (@ 6 each district) for 8
       districts and were trained for 2 days at RMRI, Patna to help the programme on
       monitoring and supervision. These link volunteer have been oriented for monitoring and
       supervising of IRS Spray. The HR by CARE shall be expanded in all the 33 districts.

10. Issues
    Delay in release of funds to districts for implementation of programme activities and
       delay in submission of utilization certificate to Govt. of India.
    Inadequate supervision & monitoring of the programme due to large number of vacancies
       of health functionaries like DMOs, Malaria Inspectors at various levels. The monitoring
       and supervision is also suffering due to non positioning of contractual staff. ASHAs
       honorariums are not being paid timely resulting their reluctance to work in         KA
       programme.
    Dedicated and more sincere efforts from District Malaria Officers of high endemic
       districts of Bihar is required.
    Timely payment of loss of wages to Kala azar patient is not being adhered.




                                              56
    Due to weak IEC/BCC and inadequate social mobilization the acceptance of DDT spray
    is poor among the community.
   Training to all categories needs to be strengthened.
   District Collectors need to be involved in regular review of the programme at district
    level.

       # This baseline data is the data from the Household surveys conducted by NIMR in 2008-2009
       = In the baseline survey this indicator gave the information on percentage of individuals who
       slept under ITN (Insecticide Treated Net). LLIN( Long lasting insecticidal Net ) distribution was
       started under the project, in year 2010 and so the final target is for use of LLINs where it has been
       distributed.
       *NA = Not available. The data was to be collected by LQAS surveys to be done by MTSs/KTSs.
       As the recruitment and trainings of MTSs/KTSs were done in Year 2, the LQAS surveys were
       started in year 3 onwards after their training for LQAS and so the data for year 2 are not
       available.
       (iii) The blocks that not achieved the goal of elimination were targeted for intervention under the
       project and so, the baseline status was 0 %. It was estimated that it will be brought up to 50 %
       Data for polio coverage are available from MCH division

Annex 7. B) Borrower's Comments on Draft ICR

                Directorate of National Vector Borne Disease Control Program
            Comments on Implementation Completion and Results Report, World Bank


The report is well written and comprehensive. The point wise specific comments on the report of
NVBDCP are as under:-

(A)Overall general comments on the report:-
    Considering the impact of the project on the malaria and kala-azar morbidity and
       mortality the project outcome may be rated as ‘moderately satisfactory’ instead of
       ‘moderately unsatisfactory’.
    C.1 Ratings summary/Performance rating by ICR - Borrower performance- instead of
       unsatisfactory it may also be rated as moderately satisfactory. Further the World Bank
       implementation Support Missions reviewed the progress of the project from time to time
       and has rated the project moderately satisfactory and Implementation Support Mission
       13th September to 15th October 2010 has rated project as Satisfactory. Therefore, overall
       rating should be moderately Satisfactory.
    Considering the steps taken by the Banks in the prevailing circumstances their
       performance may also be rated as ‘moderately satisfactory’ instead of ‘moderately
       unsatisfactory’.
    Similarly, in the report at various sections the rating as ‘moderately unsatisfactory’ may
       be replaced with ‘moderately satisfactory’.
    It is understood that by making such modification the report can be made positive without
       changing overall implication. Further it is informed that the National Health Mission
       (NHM) came into existence in 2013 merging National Rural Health Mission (NRHM)
       and National Urban Health Mission (NHUM).

(B)       Specific comments on the report:-
         Under PDO indicators (a) and Intermediate Outcome Indicators (b) some changes are
          suggested and may be seen in the track mode. May be reviewed and changed accordingly.
         Few minor changes/ additions i.e. at p.no.11, 20 & 48-49 may be seen in track mode for
          review/consideration and changes.


(C)       Some factual explanation on the project implementation:-
         ASHA incentive- it should be considered as one of the important innovations of the
          programme for ensuring diagnosis and treatment at community level in time. It was met
          from Domestic Budget Support and should be considered as counterpart financing.
         The observation made on delay decision making/engaging consultant agencies /
          recruitment / procurement etc , it is submitted that the all laid down codal formalities/
          checks & balances are to be observed to follow procedures for meeting the administrative
          and financial requirement . Accordingly, the final view may be taken in the report.
         It is also observed that the World Bank norms for procurement also impeded the progress

                                                 62
items like motor cycle, vehicles, computer etc. For these items the states and PSUs have
very clear and transparent procedure at any part of the country, hence decentralized
procurement of these items would not have           made any difference in financial
implications but certainly the expeditious procurement could have facilitated effective
supervision and to monitoring of implementation of program.
