                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to enhance the effectiveness of government response to control malaria, eliminate kala azar and eradicate polio. This will be
                         achieved by an increase in the number of people benefiting from effective prevention, diagnosis and treatment services for malaria and kala azar, and vaccination
                         against polio.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall, implementation progress and progress towards the PDOs continue to be rated as moderately satisfactory, as: a) Orissa, Andhra Pradesh and MP are making satisfactory
                         progress on Malaria control/prevention with increased institutionalization and ownership; and b) there is improved community awareness of the testing and treatment at public health

                         centres as well as the improved availability of drugs and doctors at the PHC level. Specifically, all the project districts for malaria as well as for Kala Azar have been declared ready
                         (districts have to clear a readiness filter before implementation can take place) and are implementing project interventions. Increasingly patients are approaching the public health
                         institutions for diagnosis and treatment. While malaria activities are satisfactory in Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Orissa, they need considerable strengthening in Jharkhand
                         and Chhattisgarh. Four new Malaria states (Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and West Bengal) are now included in Phase II of the project. These States have demonstrated speedy

                         implementation, and have shown that they are capable of producing results in the time left prior to project closure. Their effectiveness will depend on regular and timely support from
                         the centre. For Kala Azar (KA), while all three project states (Bihar, Jharkhand, and West Bengal) have made progress on implementation, Bihar and Jharkhand need to move from a
                         reactive to a proactive detection and treatment approach in order to achieve the elimination targets. Indoor Residual Spray (IRS) rounds are taking place in Bihar, West Bengal and
                         Jharkhand to control KA, further improvement in the monitoring and supervision of this activity would greatly enhance the control of this vector. Delays in the central procurement of
                         additional Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs) due to slow decision taking and bid disputes are limiting the impact of Information, Education and Communication/Behaviour Change
                         Communication (IEC/BCC) activities. The project has, however, shown unprecedented progress in implementation of environmental due diligence, including developing
                         Environmental Codes of Practices for sound management of the insecticide chain, which can be claimed as a global best practice. Additionally progress has been made in
                         undertaking capacity building and awareness campaigns and rationalizing procurement and distribution chain of insecticides. Important steps have also been taken by Government to
                         ensure the sustainability of project interventions, particularly since the project is due to close in 15 months. For example, the state of Orissa is already initiating the mainstreaming of
                         consultants (VBD, MTS) for the delivery of the program & Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) – a clear recognition of the acceptance of project interventions. These project
                         interventions have also been mainstreamed into the national program as part of the recently approved 12th Five Year Plan.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Recent efforts by the government to control malaria and eradicate polio have yielded tangible results. There have been no new polio cased in India now for more than a year and it
                         has been taken off the list of polio-endemic countries. The goal should now be to maintain effective vaccination until the disease is eradicated. Routine project monitoring data
                         suggests that the support has led to an increase in the number of people benefiting from effective diagnosis and treatment services for malaria, but more needs to be done on

                         prevention and vector control. Also, more support is needed in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh for effective implementation of the program. The kala azar effort has also shown progress
                         in recent months in all the three project states, but a much more vigorous effort is needed - especially in Bihar State where the bulk of the disease burden is present - in order to bring
                         the elimination goal to fruition.
