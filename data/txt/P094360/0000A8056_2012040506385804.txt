                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to enhance the effectiveness of government response to control malaria, eliminate kala azar and eradicate polio. This will be
                         achieved by an increase in the number of people benefiting from effective prevention, diagnosis and treatment services for malaria and kala azar, and vaccination
                         against polio.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         There have been no reported cases of polio in India for over 12 months, which is a remarkable achievement, particularly given the situation just 3-4 years ago. Progress on the
                         utilization of the polio component of this project has been satisfactory to date, with the project funds being used to maintain a consistent supply of oral polio vaccines for the national

                         program. On malaria, there have been significant improvements in the availability of diagnostic kits and malaria treatments, in disease surveillance, and in the field-level
                         implementation of BCC/IIEC activities and the development of environmental codes of practice. However, delays in the procurement and distribution of long-lasting insecticide treated
                         bed-nets (LLINs) have hampered program implementation, and therefore the full achievement of results. Expediting the distribution of bed-nets and providing focused support to the
                         states with weaker capacities will go a long way in bringing down the prevalence of malaria nationally. Some progress has also been made in the implementation of the kala azar (KA)

                         progress and progress towards the PDOS are both rated as moderately satisfactory, as: a) more work is required in the lagging states on capacity building and ensuring that the
                         changes brought about by the project are institutionalized and sustained; b) the procurement and distribution of both malaria and kala azar related commodities needs to be
                         expedited as a matter of priority and c) the national goal of kala azar elimination will require a faster and more far-reaching response in the affected states.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Recent efforts by the government to control malaria and eradicate polio have yielded tangible results. There have been no new polio cased in India now for more than a year and it
                         has been taken off the list of polio-endemic countries. The goal should now be to maintain effective vaccination until the disease is eradicated. Routine project monitoring data
                         suggests that the support has led to an increase in the number of people benefiting from effective diagnosis and treatment services for malaria, but more needs to be done on

                         prevention and vector control. Also, more support is needed in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh for effective implementation of the program. The kala azar effort has also shown progress
                         in recent months in all the three project states, but a much more vigorous effort is needed - especially in Bihar State where the bulk of the disease burden is present - in order to bring
                         the elimination goal to fruition.
