                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to enhance the effectiveness of government response to control malaria, eliminate kala azar and eradicate polio. This will be
                         achieved by an increase in the number of people benefiting from effective prevention, diagnosis and treatment services for malaria and kala azar, and vaccination
                         against polio.

                         Implementation progress and the achievement of PDOs under the project had consistently been rated moderately satisfactory/satisfactory over the past 3 years, despite periodic
                         interruptions in procurement, issues with the hiring and retention of staff, and delays in M&E. This was due to the observed increases in the utilization of public services at the national

                         level, decreases in disease prevalence and mortality resulting from malaria and kala azar, and the landmark progress made on the eradication of polio in India. On the vector borne
                         components, available evidence suggested that the increased utilization of services and the decreases in prevalence and mortality were correlated with the improved use of project
                         inputs for the diagnosis and treatment of malaria and kala azar, effective Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS), IEC/BCC activities and effective monitoring and supervision. The

                         perceived to be contributing to the success of the disease control efforts - in fact, given the progress made, these technical positions have now been integrated, as part of the 12th
                         Five-Year Plan, into the national vector borne disease programs under NRHM. The polio component, in turn, has been very successful, contributing to India now being taken off the
                         list of polio-endemic countries.

                         Over the past year, however, the observed improvements on malaria and kala azar have stalled, due primarily to issues with the vector control activities, as well as the recent
                         significant delays in the procurement of commodities - such as LLINs, ACT Combipacks and Miltefosine capsules - under the project, which have preempted the effective
                         implementation of the two national programs.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         As noted, the project has been slow to disburse under the VBD component primarily due to delays in the central procurement of Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs) and other key
                         diagnostic and treatment related commodities. In order to support the timely disbursement of project funds and ensure that stock-outs of commodities do not occur, both decentralized
                         procurement by certain states, as well as the engagement of UNICEF for the procurement of LLINs centrally, was requested by the client and approved by the Bank. However, owing

                         to pricing and specification issues compounded by time constraints, the central procurement of LLINs through UNICEF, as well as the decentralized procurement at state level, were
                         canceled. This has led to substantial shortfalls in expenditure as a major share of the remaining funding under the VBD component of the project was for the centralized procurement
                         of commodities. Since the project is closing on December 31, 2013, and since it is unlikely that these procurements will be completed in time even if a rebidding process using the
                         existing government system were to be initiated, the GoI has requested a cancellation of US$ 100 million from the credit, which is being processed.
