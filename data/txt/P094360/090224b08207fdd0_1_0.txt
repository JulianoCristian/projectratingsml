                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to enhance the effectiveness of government response to control malaria, eliminate kala azar and eradicate polio. This will be
                         achieved by an increase in the number of people benefiting from effective prevention, diagnosis and treatment services for malaria and kala azar, and vaccination
                         against polio.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project continues to progress, albeit slowly. There is a continued decline in API and mortality figures. This is primarily due to improved use of project inputs such as improved
                         diagnostics and treatment, more effective vector control activities, especially Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS), greater focus on IEC/BCC activities, and stronger monitoring and

                         supervision through the recruitment of additional staff and implementation of LQAS. Additionally, there has been an improved focus on highly endemic areas within districts and
                         blocks maximizing impact. Some states have also started implementing specific innovations to address context specific issues resulting in more effective implementation.

                         Overall, implementation has been variable across project states. Among the Phase I malaria states, Orissa is doing well, while Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh need to build on

                         their progress through pro-active measures to overcome training gaps and prevent delays in procurement of insecticides and consequently IRS. Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and West
                         Bengal remain poor performing states with significant human resource vacancies, training gaps and consequently poor implementation of vector control and treatment activities.
                         Among the Phase II states, Gujarat and Karnataka are doing well, while Maharashtra may require some hand holding support.

                         Among the Kala Azar states, West Bengal continues to be the most active in treatment compliance and the pro-active search for both KA and PKDL cases, as well as the
                         development of district level BCC/IEC activities. Little progress has been made in Jharkhand, while implementation has improved in Bihar.

                         The Environmental Code of Practices (ECOP) and the pictorial training modules developed by the project can be considered an international best practice, and have contributed to an
                         increased awareness of safe practices among spray workers and the community. Monitoring and evaluation as a whole has improved, with the processes for the endline surveys for
                         Phase I states and baseline surveys for Phase II states initiated, and the Kala Azar MIS successfully piloted. In the context of the Phase II malaria districts, it should be noted that a
                         requirement of the project is that project interventions could only be initiated in these districts once both these districts and all Phase I districts met the requisite readiness criteria.
                         While the Phase II districts were therefore only declared effective in September, 2011, it was nevertheless agreed to carrying out the baselines so that future progress in these
                         districts could be tracked as part of the larger national program. As on July 24, 2013, against the revised total allocation of SDR 216.732 million (post cancellation of SDR 103.168
                         million) disbursement stands at SDR 151.094 million (equivalent of USD 233.903 million), reflecting a disbursement of 69.7% of the revised project allocation.

                         Key Decisions for Disclosure
                         Delays in central procurement of LLINs, ACTs and Miltefosine have been persistent barriers to effective implementation, more so in states with weak capacity, such as Jharkhand and
                         Chhattisgarh. Stronger states like Orissa and Gujarat have been able to overcome delays in central procurement to an extent, by procuring LLINs at the state level. However, the
                         need to put in place a long term solution to this continual problem was highlighted to ensure no further stock-outs of critical commodities. Towards this end, it was decided to explore
                         the use UN agencies such as UNICEF and decentralized procurement, where such capacities exist, and explore the implementation of longer term procurement contracts with drug
                         firms contracted to supply ACTs and Miltefosine. Currently, yearly contracts are in place, which given the time taken for completing procurement processes, often results in delays in
                         contracting and consequently drug supply.

                         To address the issue of high attrition of project staff due to issues of pay parity and concerns about continuity due to the expected closure of project in December, 2013, it was
                         decided that the Government would send out a notification/letter to the project states, clearly giving concurrence for increasing salaries to ensure pay parity and informing project staff
                         of their continuation within the project (contingent on their performance) with domestic funds under the NRHM

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Delays in central procurement of LLINs, ACTs and Miltefosine have been persistent barriers to effective implementation, more so in states with weak capacity, such as Jharkhand and
                         Chhattisgarh. Stronger states like Orissa and Gujarat have been able to overcome delays in central procurement to an extent, by procuring LLINs at the state level. However, the
                         need to put in place a long term solution to this continual problem was highlighted to ensure no further stock-outs of critical commodities. Towards this end, it was decided to explore
                         the use of UN agencies such as UNICEF and decentralized procurement, where such capacities exist, and explore the implementation of longer term procurement contracts with drug
                         firms contracted to supply ACTs and Miltefosine. Currently, yearly contracts are in place, which given the time taken for completing procurement processes, often results in delays in
                         contracting and consequently drug supply.

                         To address the issue of high attrition of project staff due to issues of pay parity and concerns about continuity due to the expected closure of project in December, 2013, it was

                         decided that the Government would send out a notification/letter to the project states, clearly giving concurrence for increasing salaries to ensure pay parity and informing project staff
                         of their continuation within the project (contingent on their performance) with domestic funds under the NRHM.
