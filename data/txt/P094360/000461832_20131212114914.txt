A. Summary of Proposed Changes
A cancellation of US$100 million (SDR65.27 million) under the Vector Borne Disease Control and Polio
Eradication Support Project is proposed. The cancellation responds to a request from the GOI, dated
December 3, 2013, to cancel the stated amount due to significant underutilization in the project. The
shortfalls in expenditure are the result of cancellations in the procurement of commodities, primarily of
Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs), which are a major procurement item under the project (as well as
due to some savings from decentralized expenditure). As the project closes on December 31, 2013, these
procurements are unlikely to be completed in the time remaining under the project. After the cancellation,
approximately USD 1.4 million will remain under the Credit for the remaining contractual commitments in
the project.

B. Project Status
The project became effective on March 6, 2009, and has since been restructured twice. It was first
restructured in November, 2010 to allow for the procurement of polio vaccines from non-UN sources, and
again in December, 2012 for the cancellation of SDR 103.17 million (SDR 45.7 and 57.46 million
respectively, from Vector Borne Disease (VBD) and Polio components) due to the slow disbursement of

                                               5
funds and their anticipated non-utilization in the remaining project period.

Over the past 2-3 years, implementation progress and achievement of PDOs had consistently been rated
moderately satisfactory/satisfactory, despite some delays in the procurement of commodities under the
VBD components and issues with hiring and retention of staff. This was due to observed increases in the
utilization of public services and decreases in the prevalence of, as well as the mortality resulting from
Malaria and Kala Azar. Available evidence suggested that the increased utilization of services and the
decreases in prevalence and mortality were correlated with the improved use of project inputs for the
diagnosis and treatment of Malaria and Kala Azar and effective implementation of Indoor Residual
Spraying (IRS), IEC/BCC activities and monitoring and supervision. The recruitment of critical technical
and monitoring staff, such as the VBD Consultants and the Malaria/Kala Azar Technical Supervisors at the
district and sub-district level were also perceived to be contributing to the success of the disease control
efforts. These technical positions have therefore, now been integrated into the national program under
NRHM, as part of the 12th Five-Year Plan. The polio component, in turn, was very successful,
contributing to the eradication of polio in India, with India now being taken off the list of polio-endemic
countries.

However, in the past year, the observed improvements on Malaria and Kala Azar have stalled due to
significant delays in the procurement of commodities at the central level and the unwillingness of
MOHFW to allow decentralized procurement, which has preempted the effective implementation of
critical vector control activities. Delays in IRS and cancellations in the procurement of LLINs, ACT
Combipack and Miltefosine capsules recently, have set back the gains made during the project period. In
addition, due to delays in contracting as well as the timely release of funds for the endline survey, it is no
longer possible to undertake the endline survey in the five Phase 1 states prior to project closure. The
failure to undertake the survey makes it difficult to assess rigorously the changes in disease prevalence and
mortality that are attributable to the project. The absence of quality data is all the more unfortunate since it
will prevent the documentation of success stories from better performing project states such as Orissa,
Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh (among the Phase 1 states) and Gujarat and Karnataka (among the
Phase 2 states) that could provide important lessons for the national program, going forward. The project is
therefore currently rated as ‘moderately unsatisfactory’.

As on December 4, 2013, against the revised total allocation of SDR 216.732 million (post cancellation of
SDR 103.168 million) disbursement stands at SDR 153.846 million (equivalent of US$238.093 million).
This reflects a disbursement of 71% of the revised project allocation and includes amount of SDR 107.342
million disbursed for the polio component (Part B) and SDR 0.696 million for the reinstatement of Project
Preparation Facility (Part A-PPF). The undisbursed balance (including unadjusted advance in the
Designated Account of US$5 million) stands at approximately US$101.4 million.

Project Development Objectives (P094360 - India: National Vector Borne Disease Control & Polio
Eradication Support Project)
Original PDO
The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to enhance the effectiveness of government response to
control malaria, eliminate kala azar and eradicate polio. This will be achieved by an increase in the number
of people benefiting from effective prevention, diagnosis and treatment services for malaria and kala azar,
and vaccination against polio.

Cancellations
Explanation:
A cancellation of US$100 million (SDR 65.27 million) IDA credit out of the remaining credit amount of
USD 101.4 million (SDR 66.08 million; this includes the unadjusted advance in the Designated Account of
US$5 million) from the project is proposed. The US$100 million will be cancelled from the VBD
components (i.e. components 1, 2 and 3) of the project. All funds from the Polio component have already
been utilized and all procurement under this component has been completed (after cancellation of
unutilized amount through an earlier restructuring in Dec, 2012). After cancellation, approximately, US$
1.4 million will remain with the Directorate to fulfill the remaining contractual commitments under the
credit up to December 31, 2013 when the project closes.

As noted, the project has been slow to disburse under the VBD components primarily due to delays in the
central procurement of Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs), and some other key diagnostic and
treatment related commodities. In order to support the timely disbursement of project funds and ensure that
stock-outs of commodities do not occur, both decentralized procurement by states, as well as the
engagement of UNICEF, for the procurement of LLINs was requested by the client and approved by the
Bank. However, owing to pricing, specification and time constraints, the procurement of LLINs through
UNICEF at the central level, and at state level by Karnataka, Chhattisgarh and Odisha, was cancelled. This
has led to substantial shortfalls in expenditure as a major share of the remaining funding under the VBD
components of the project was for the procurement of commodities. Further, since the project is closing on
December 31, 2013, it is unlikely that these procurements will be completed in time even if a rebidding
process using the existing government system were to be initiated. The GOI has therefore requested a
cancellation of US$ 100 million, so that this amount may be returned to the IDA16 pool for India for
reallocation by the DEA to other IDA projects.

Details of the current and proposed project costs (in US$ million) across components and categories,
following cancellation, are provided in subsequent sections.

reflected in the system, therefore these figures may differ from what is seen in the portal.
