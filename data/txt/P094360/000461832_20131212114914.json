This will be achieved by an increase in the\n            number of people benefiting from effective prevention,\n            diagnosis and treatment services for malaria and kala azar,\n            and vaccination against polio. This paper pertains to a full\n            restructuring of the project, including a restructuring of\n            the project development objective, changes and reallocations\n            in the financing plan, and changes in the project components\n            and costs. The restructuring is primarily due to constraints\n            in procurement, which led to a major shortfall in\n            expenditure and consequently affected project implementation."}, "docdt": "2013-12-03T00:00:00Z"}
