                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to enhance the effectiveness of government response to control malaria, eliminate kala azar and eradicate polio. This will be
                         achieved by an increase in the number of people benefiting from effective prevention, diagnosis and treatment services for malaria and kala azar, and vaccination
                         against polio.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Progress against most project indicators continues to be rated as moderately satisfactory. Malaria prevalence in the project districts has shown a decline in recent years and on Kala
                         Azar (KA), there has been a significant decrease in the overall prevalence and mortality across the three KA affected states, namely Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal. Overall

                         program performance has been variable which is primarily due to varying state capacities in implementing the program and the geographic phasing of project interventions. Progress
                         on social safeguards and environmental aspects has been slow in the last six months, after a period of good progress. The delayed recruitment of field consultant positions across the
                         states and the challenge of high staff attrition remain. There have also been delays in the central procurement of commodities and the Government is now taking action to rectify
                         procurement related issues in order to ensure timely supply of these commodities.

                         $88 million against the polio component. This cancellation was processed in December, 2012. Of the remaining project funds, about 66% has been disbursed to date.

                         It is clear that the interventions implemented under the project have made a difference on the ground, with no new cases of polio for two years now, and with reductions in malaria
                         and KA prevalence and mortality. However, there is a need to document and analyze results through a systematic and rigorous quantification of the changes.

                         Furthermore, the lagging states will need to prioritize their efforts, and focused support from the Central government will be required in the implementation of both the malaria and KA
                         programs. For example, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have agreed to focus their limited capacity on interventions in the districts/blocks with the highest malaria endemicity in order to
                         maximize impact - close supervision and monitoring of these efforts will be required. Similarly, the majority of KA cases and deaths occur in 11 high burden districts in Bihar; focusing
                         indoor residual spraying and IEC/BCC activities, along with improved monitoring and supervision, on these high burden districts could lead to a very significant reduction in KA cases.
                         There is also a need to intensify monitoring and supervision capacity in Jharkhand.

                         The project has introduced a number of new interventions in the malaria control program for testing, treatment, monitoring and supervision. It is important that these new interventions
                         are mainstreamed under the national program. In order to ensure the seamless continuation of the project activities, the existing field staff and consultants also need to be retained.
                         Given the challenges in recruiting and training consultants, existing consultants need to be formally notified of the continued funding of their positions under the 12th Plan. Further, it
                         is essential that they are paid on time and that pay parity with NRHM workers is ensured.

                         With only 9 months left before project closure, the sustainability of the project interventions needs to be ensured. The GoI decision to continue funding of the vector borne disease
                         control activities under the Twelfth Five-Year Plan is therefore a welcome sign. The benefits that are expected to arise from this, such as access to the National Rural Health Mission
                         (NRHM) flexi-pool funds and an increase in vector control management, should ensure mainstreaming of vector-borne control programs under the NRHM. However, translation of
                         these potential benefits into effective implementation on the ground will be an important area to focus on going forward.
