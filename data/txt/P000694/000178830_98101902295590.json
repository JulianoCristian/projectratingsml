support the\n            Borrower's Education Plan that aims to promote a\n            qualitative improvement in Ethiopia's education system,\n            provide a wider distribution of educational opportunities,\n            and achieve universal primary education by about 1989. The\n            project will comprise a three year phase (1981 to 1984) of\n            the Plan's investment program. It will build upon the\n            educational development provided under earlier IDA-assisted\n            education projects and will: (i) expand primary, secondary\n            (lower and higher) and non-formal education; (ii) strengthen\n            maintenance programs for educational facilities; (iii)\n            expand educational support services at the district level;\n            (iv) help reorient curricula towards practical work and\n            studies; (v) help establish a school of veterinary medicine,\n            and (vi) help evaluate educational methodology and the\n            supply and demand for manpower. The project will raise\n            enrollment ratios significantly at all levels, particularly\n            in rural areas, and help to adjust the imbalance in the\n            geographical distribution of schools."}, "docdt": "1981-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
