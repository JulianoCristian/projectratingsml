                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1.       During the second Joint Annual Review which was conducted on January 27, 2011, the Government called for joint missions by cooperating partners supporting the LDF to

                         reduce transaction costs in terms of time the TST spends supporting separate missions.

                         2.       The Local Development Fund has demonstrated capacity to deliver education infrastructure quickly and efficiently through the construction of teachers'™ houses across the
                         country. Consequently, the Government proposed to the Bank use the Local Development Fund as an additional implementation mechanism to build classrooms using US$30 million
                         from resources under the Education SWAp. This is a welcome move, and arrangements are underway to finalize the process of making the resources accessible by the LDF by
                         December 2011.
