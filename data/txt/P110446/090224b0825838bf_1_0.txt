                         The project performance on reaching the development objective was rated satisfactory while the overall implementation progress was rated moderately satisfactory. However due to
                         control and accountability issues raised in the audit management letter, the beneficiary targeting related issues and the inadequate staffing levels at local councils the rating for the
                         Overall Implementation Progress has been maintained at Moderately Satisfactory.

                         Report, the current assessment is as follows:

                         1. Relevance.

                          Prior to restructuring:
                         i). The Project was approved in 2008. The relevance of the PDO, design and implementation was substantial. The MASAF 3 APL II (LDF Mechanism) Project DO was consistent with
                         the FY2007-2011 CAS objectives and was one of the Bank’s portfolio instruments that aims to support the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MDGS) by assisting poor and
                         vulnerable households, through decentralized mechanisms, to improve their livelihoods, access basic social and economic infrastructure and reduce household vulnerability. Due to
                         the success of the MASAF’s public works and savings and investment programs in improving household outcomes and building the capacity of local authorities, IDA has provided
                         substantial and ongoing support to MASAF since 1995. Consistent with the CAS goals, the original project served the social protection needs of households that have limited access
                         to and use of specified service packages, vulnerable individuals needing assistance, and households with limited employment opportunities.

                         During the preparation of the first Additional Financing (AF I), the team took the opportunity to restructure the Project as follows: (i) reworded the PDO to make it more concise and
                         measurable without changing its substance; and (ii) revised the results framework to better reflect
                         the targeted actions and intended outcomes of both the original Project as well as the Additional Financing; and (iii) to aligned it with the Bank's monitoring requirements. The original
                         PDO was: “to improve the livelihoods of poor households within the framework of improved local governance at the community, local authority, and national levels.” The new PDO is:
                         “to improve the livelihoods of poor and vulnerable households and to strengthen the capacity of local authorities to manage local development.” The Bank's Africa Region QK Results
                         & Learning (AFTRL) group and the borrower supported the proposed changes to the DO and the Results Framework. Before restructuring, the project's performance was at
                         Moderately Satisfactory and was on course to achieving.

                         ii). Relevance of the design. The design was relevant as it took into account the need to support: poor households access opportunities to income enhancing opportunities, poor
                         communities with access to social services, and build local authorities capacities preparing them to manage local development in a decentralized environment. The design was good
                         as it had the flexibility of being scaled up or scaled down in responding to crises. The design also allowed the Local Development Fund-TAST to manage ring-fenced funds by other
                         Government/donor funded projects.

                         iii) Relevance of Implementation. The project implementation remained relevant as it is through the decentralized government structure consolidating the capacity building efforts at
                         the local assembly level; the design remained flexible to accommodate the scale up of the public works in 2010 during the crisis.

                         POST RESTRUCTURING ASSESSMENT:
                         The relevance of the reworded PDO, design and implementation after the restructuring is substantial
                         (i) Relevance of objectives: The reworded PDO was relevant to Malawi's development priorities as it is directly related to the Africa Strategy through the Pillar 2: Vulnerability and
                         Resilience. The Project remained consistent with the Bank's objectives in the FY2007- 2011 CAS as well as the CAS approved February 2013. The project is one of the Bank's
                         portfolio instruments that support the Malawi Second Growth and Development Strategy (MDGS II) by assisting the poor and vulnerable households, through decentralized
                         mechanisms, to improve their livelihoods, access basic social and economic infrastructure and reduce household vulnerability. Consistent with the CAS goals, the original project, the
                         first Additional Financing and the Second Additional Financing have served the social protection needs of households which have limited access to and use of service; vulnerable

                         individuals requiring assistance; and households with limited employment opportunities. The PDO has been rated Satisfactory and on course to attaining the outcomes.

                         (ii) Relevance of the design: The design of the project was relevant as well although it was limited as it did not fully build on an earlier CDD approach which was used in previous
                         phases of the MASAF project since 1996.The design of MASAF 3 APL II had inherent aspects that allowed the Project to be delivered through the decentralized government
                         structure which facilitated the rapid scale up of interventions to respond to the 2012-2013 crises in the country to reach the vulnerable poor with safety nets under the labor intensive
                         public works intervention. The design also allowed the project to implement ring-fenced funds from other Bank projects with CDD aspects which led to wider reach and coverage for
                         impact. especially in the education sector. In responding to the severe crisis in 2012, the number of job opportunities to a beneficiary household was increased from 12 to 48 days,
                         the wage rate was also increased following the 49% devaluation that took place.

                         (iii) Relevance of Implementation. The project implementation remains relevant as it is through the decentralized government structure consolidating the capacity building efforts; it is
                         also flexible to accommodate the scale up of the public works in times of crisis. The experience with the redesigned scaled-up PWP under the Rapid Response Program made it

                         The Achievement of the PDO is rated Satisfactory.
                         Community Livelihood Support Fund component: The project is in the process of consolidating the achievements as reports come in from the districts, however the following are the
                         achievements on the PDO indicators (as of December 2013): (i) PWSP beneficiaries reached are 1,610,824 surpassing the set target of 1,490,125. Out of total beneficiaries 50% are
                         female; (ii) PWSP beneficiaries with savings of at least 50% of PWSP wage one year after participation - 78,330 managed against the end of project target of 48,750; and 40 percent
                         are female; (iii) PWSP beneficiaries that were able to buy agricultural inputs following participation in the PWSP are 557,345 against a target of 714,000; (iv) Person days provided in
                         labor intensive work in public works - achievement is 19,329,888 against a set target of 19,500,000; (v) Number of Local Councils with unqualified audit reports - 21 councils (62%)
                         out of target of 20 (60%). (vi) Procurement: Percent procurement of goods and services at Local Authority level based on competitive bidding - 94% against 70% target.

                         Further to the above achievements, the in-depth Public Works Tracking Study (2012) has generated significant evidence that the MASAF 3 APL II Project interventions are having
                         positive impacts on the beneficiary livelihoods: (i) 52 percent of Public Works beneficiaries have increased household incomes; ii) 10.9 percent of beneficiaries have been able to
                         purchase household assets using PWP cash earned; and iii) 79 percent of Community Savings and Investment group members have generated income above 50 percent of the initial
                         cash transfer they received. With regard to improvements in food security: i) use of wages to meet basic food needs declined from 62 percent to 54 percent of PW beneficiaries (2011
                         and 2012 Tracking Studies respectively); ii) 50 percent of Savings and Investment group members indicated that they are no longer food insecure due to improvements in their
                         financial status as a result of various income generating interventions the groups have engaged in; iii) The study also showed that there has been improvements in household maize
                         production as 34.6 percent (in 2011) and 30 percent i(in 2012) PWSP beneficiaries spent their wages on farm inputs (maize seed and fertilizer); and iv) 67 percent of PW
                         beneficiaries benefited directly from the Fertilizer Subsidy Program (FISP) this demonstrates the synergy between the PW program and the FISP towards improving household food
                         security. It has also been observed that 12.6 percent of PW beneficiaries used the earnings for school fees and purchase of other scholastic materials. For access to health facilities,
                         10.6 percent and 2.7 percent (2011 and 2012 tracking studies respectively) beneficiaries also used PW earnings to pay for medical bills and medicines.

                         The Project has made considerable contribution towards improvements in the education and health sectors (PWP Tracer Study 2012). Through the construction of Primary School
                         Staff Houses (1, 442 staff houses) there is significant improvement of living conditions for teacher s. In the intervention areas, 28.7 percent of beneficiary teachers now live in
                         relatively 'modem houses’; and 71 percent of these houses are either connected to the national grid for electricity or have solar equipment installed and are functional. This is a rare
                         privilege in the rural areas and is attracting teachers to stay in rural areas and ultimately it will contribute to improvements in education outcomes.

                         Local Authority Capacity Enhancement Fund component: Assessments for the performance on two PDO indicators show that through the Performance Assessment Measures (PAM)
                         the Project has generated evidence of better procurement practices and improvements in financial management to demonstrate Project impacts. The average score for financial
                         management has improved from 49 (2011) to 53 percent in 2012. The PAM also indicated that for procurement of goods and services at Local Authority level based on competitive
                         bidding, on average, councils scored 77 percent on adherence to key procurement requirements, meaning that they have procurement units and Internal Procurement Committees in
                         place; they have Procurement Plans and a satisfactory level of implementation; and that they adhere to procurement thresholds. 94 percent of the local councils showed evidence of
                         records on procurements using competitive bidding.

                         The DEC colleagues are conducting the PWP Impact Evaluation. The IE data collection was completed and work is at data analysis stage, so it is expected that the preliminary
                         findings will capture information that will further inform the assessment towards the development objectives. Nevertheless, the general performance under the components in terms
                         of outputs has been encouraging, with targets surpassed in most cases.

                         The Project is closing June 30, 2014, it is expected that the two Credits and the Grant will be fully disbursed by then. An ICR Mission will be undertaken in July 2014.

                         The Follow-on project is the Malawi Strengthening of Safety Nets Project-Fourth Malawi Social Action Fund (MASA F IV) was approved by the Board on December 18, 2013. This
                         project will support PWP, unconditional cash transfers and capacity enhancement.

                         example, the costs of a classroom block with two classrooms and fitted with 60 desks costs about US$22,000. A similar classroom block constructed under the Education
                         Infrastructure Management Unit of the Ministry of Education costs USD27, 095 plus 35 percent for external works and consultancy fees of 66 percent higher. This does not include
                         desks. For a teachers house, the unit cost under MASAF is USD25,000 while under EIMU it is about USD 30,240 plus 35 percent for external works and consultant's fees. Most of the
                         costs under alternative approaches go into overhead costs like supervision for consultants, profits for the consultants and contractors. Besides being cost effective, the MASAF
                         approach strengthens ownership of the facilities which reduces cases of vandalism, as it also places the responsibility for maintenance in the hands of the community. This improves
                         sustainability of the assets created.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1. The project is progressing towards achieving the development objectives. The coverage on indicators is surpassing the set targets in most indicators, and there is 100 percent
                         disbursement under MASAF 3 APL II original Credit and 68 percent under the First Additional Financing, with the second Additional Financing registering 85 percent of the Credit and
                         84 percent of the Grant. It is anticipated that the balance of resources under the two additional Financings will be fully utilized by June 30, 2014, the Closing Date of the Project.

                         2. Due to delays in financial reporting by the local councils, there were delays in implementing the second cycle under the Public Works Program, which does not reflect positively on
                         the performance of both the councils and the LDF-TST.
