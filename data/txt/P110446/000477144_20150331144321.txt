    H. Restructuring

In addition to the restructurings done during the approval process of the additional
financings, the Project had only one restructuring. It was done just before project closing,
on June 30, 2014, and was needed in order to apply some final reallocation and adjustment
of amounts among components and categories.

    1.   PROJECT CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      When Malawi Third Social Action Fund (MASAF III) Adaptable Program Lending (APL)
II was appraised in late 2007, slightly over half of the country’s 6.4 million people were living
below the national poverty line and 22 percent were in extreme poverty. Poverty was more
widespread in rural areas. Moreover, poverty was dynamic with high levels of transient poverty
based on shocks and economic conditions. Most Malawians suffered from chronic food insecurity,
relying on agriculture characterized by low yields and depending on rain-fed farming which
increases vulnerability to weather-related shocks. The precarious food security situation had led to
a vicious cycle of emergency appeals for humanitarian assistance.

2.      Poor communities continued to face food insecurity and hunger and the lack effective access
to basic services and infrastructure. For example, rural roads were often impassable, restricting
access to markets. In the education sector, while substantial gains had been made in enrollment,
educational infrastructure had not kept pace with these gains. Overcrowding and high student to
teacher ratios affected educational quality and the lack of housing for teachers made it difficult to
recruit and maintain staff in rural areas. For example, for the country’s 13,000 mostly rural teachers,
only 4,500 teacher houses were available, mostly in poor condition.

3.       As a way to address some of these issues, the government of Malawi (GoM) strengthened
its policy focus on safety nets. MASAF III APL II was in alignment with the government’s poverty
reduction strategy and the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS) 2006–2011. Social
protection was one of the five key themes prioritized in the MGDS. The MGDS also acknowledged
a central role for good governance, including improving service delivery and accountability at the
local level through decentralization.

4.      The World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) (FY2007–2011) for Malawi,
approved on January 4, 2007, supported the MGDS goals. MASAF III APL II aimed to contribute
toward CAS outcomes by targeting poor and vulnerable households 2 through its community
livelihoods support component (including public works activities as a social protection mechanism)
and enhancing local authority (LA) capacity (to prepare for devolution of responsibilities and
resources). It also sought to strengthen the operational links between the central and local
governments through an improved fiscal architecture and integration of MASAF systems into the
local governance system.

5.      The rationale for Bank assistance was also built on the Bank’s long involvement in social
protection and community-driven development in Malawi, and in particular as a financier of the
MASAF since its inception in 1994. In the period 1995–2002, the government invested, through
the MASAF, a total of US$122 million in community infrastructure (education, health, water supply
and sanitation, markets, roads, and bridges primarily). The Bank was well placed to continue to
help the organization engage more fully in developing effective safety nets in Malawi, both for its

  The National policy framework was laid out in the National Social Support Policy (NSSP) and identified three categories of the
poor and vulnerable to target for assistance: (i) The moderately poor: 25% (3.5 million people); (ii) The ultra-poor with labour 5%
(0.73 million people) and (iii) The ultra-poor and incapacitated:10% (1.5 million people).

                                                                1
historic involvement in the MASAF as well as its international and regional expertise in social
protection and safety nets.

1.2 Main Changes in Country Context during Project Implementation

6.     The project operated through a difficult period for the country, during which Malawi was
facing difficult economic, fiscal, and poverty challenges. In that context, the project, which was
designed to support the backbone social safety net program in the country, played a particularly
important role.

   •   Turbulent period during 2010-11: During this period, Malawi faced multiple shocks:
       adverse terms of trade, significant reduction in tobacco proceeds, governance setbacks, drop
       in donor inflows (especially budget support), and these were combined with inappropriate
       policy responses. These resulted in fiscal and external imbalances, and the severe foreign
       exchange shortages were beginning to choke the economy and shortage of fuel and other
       essential commodities. All this along with the falling domestic currency hit the poor. The
       new President acted swiftly to correct some of these concerns through policy actions in
       2012.
   •   “Cashgate” and the macroeconomic position: In September 2013, a massive theft of
       public resources by a group of government and non-government individuals was exposed.
       In consequence, Malawi’s fiscal situation deteriorated rapidly due to stoppage of aid flows
       and declining private sector confidence and the country’s global reputation. This in turn led
       to a significantly enlarged budget deficit, high-cost domestic borrowing and resurgent
       inflation, stalling earlier macroeconomic gains and their beneficial contributions to poverty
       reduction. The suspension of budget support has dominated donor dialogue with the
       Government for the past year and a half. The loss of donor budget support following
       ‘cashgate’ cost the equivalent of 10 percent of GDP.
   •   Poverty and inequality remain stubbornly high in Malawi. New official poverty
       estimates will only become available in 2017, but the expectation is that the trends will not
       differ dramatically from the findings of the Third Integrated Household Survey of 2010/11
       which showed that over half of the population was monetarily poor and one quarter lived in
       extreme poverty. Between 2004/05 and 2010/11, national poverty levels declined only
       marginally (from 52.4 to 50.7 percent of the population), and although poverty fell
       significantly in urban areas (from 25 to 17 percent) it increased slightly (from 56.2 to 56.7
       percent) in rural areas, where 85 percent of the population and 95 percent of the country’s
       poor live. Rural income inequality also increased from 2004/05 to 2010/11, with the Gini
       coefficient worsening from 0.34 to 0.38. Despite real GDP growth rates averaging 7 percent
       and household per capita consumption expenditure increasing by about 12 percent between
       2006 and 2010, real consumption in some two-thirds of rural households actually declined.
       The 2013 Integrated Household Panel Survey shows that about a third of the population
       have either exited or entered poverty and in roughly equal proportions -- but the reasons for
       these movements, as well as for the persistence of rural poverty, are imperfectly understood.
       Recognizing this, the new Government has asked for WBG help to better understand the
       drivers and dynamics of rural poverty, and to reframe its anti-poverty strategy.
   •   A key obstacle to reducing poverty is low agricultural productivity. The majority of the
       poor remain locked in low productivity subsistence farming. Access to infrastructure,
       services, land, working capital, and market opportunities are all limited, but Malawi’s

                                                 2
        current strategy for increasing agricultural productivity centers disproportionately on
        fertilizer and seed subsidies, particularly for maize (through the Farm Input Subsidy
        Program, FISP). FISP, however, is not poverty targeted and the efficiency of its
        management is questionable. Addressing these subsidies is likely to have an impact on
        income diversification and household earnings.

1.3 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

7.     The project development objective (PDO) was to improve the livelihoods of poor
households within the framework of improved local governance at community, local authority, and
national levels.

8.      The results framework included two key performance outcome indicators:

     a) At least 120,000 households annually increase their average incomes
     b) At least 70 percent of local authorities (LAs) are able to set objectives and achieve at least
        70 percent of their annual targets by Midterm Review (MTR)

9.      Output indicators were:

     a) At least 70 percent of the annual public works subprojects (PWSPs) cycles are completed
        according to plan
     b) At least 70 percent of Village Development Committees with functional institutions
        address service gaps at the community level
     c) Framework for an Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfer System to support service delivery of
        the LA defined and ready for testing by MTR
     d) Local Authority Capital Grants System defined and ready for implementation by MTR
     e) At least 70 percent of appraised Community Action Plans reflected in District Annual
        Investment Plans by MTR
     f) Community-level tracking system that delivers information annually on baselines,
        targeting, and utilization of wage earnings from PWSPs
     g) At least 70 percent of the LAs publicly disclose expenditures by MTR

1.4 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

10.    An Additional Financing (AF) project reworded the PDO to make it more concise and
measurable without changing its substance. The revised PDO was to improve the livelihoods of
poor and vulnerable households and to strengthen the capacity of local authorities to manage local
development.

11.     The changed PDO did not substantively change the objectives of the project, but clarified
some aspects, including areas for which the project was to be held accountable. While the project
was conceived at a time when the Government was pushing plans for decentralization, and the
project was seen as an instrument that would function well in such an environment, it had not been
designed or intended as a decentralization project. The revised PDO therefore put the correct
emphasis on improving the livelihoods of the vulnerable, and on building the capacity of the local
authorities.

                                                   3
12.      Four outcome indicators were added with AF 1:

      a) PWSP beneficiaries with savings of at least 50 percent of PWSP wage one year after
         participation (of which percentage female)
      b) PWSP beneficiaries who were able to buy agricultural inputs following participation in the
         PWSP (of which percentage female)
      c) Person days provided in labor intensive work in public works
      d) Number of direct project beneficiaries (International Development Agency [IDA] 14 core
         indicator 3)

13.      Several additional results indicators were added to track progress on component outputs:

      a) Rural roads rehabilitated (km) (IDA core indicator)
      b) Area reforested (ha)
      c) Area provided with irrigation and drainage services, new/rehabilitated (ha) (IDA core
         indicator)
      d) People with access to improved learning environment (number)
      e) Student classroom ratios in intervention areas with school construction (number)
      f) Classrooms and teachers’ houses built/rehabilitated (number)
      g) People with access to improved sanitation (number) (IDA core indicator) 4
      h) Safety Net Programs (PWSPs) implemented (number)
      i) Share of beneficiaries of the PWSP complying with eligibility criteria (percentage)
      j) Beneficiaries paid in a timely manner: wages paid within two weeks of works
      k) Active micro-savings accounts (number) - percentage women (IDA core indicator)
      l) Community savings and investment groups created that reach stage 3 (number)
      m) The LAs meeting specified criteria in financial management
      n) The LAs meeting specified criteria in procurement (functional Internal Procurement
         Committee [IPC], availability of procurement plan)
      o) Communities’ satisfaction with support provided by the LAs, Area Development
         Committees (ADCs), and Village Development Committees (VDCs)
      p) VDCs/ADCs actively involved in overseeing subproject implementation to address service
         gaps at the community level (percentage)
      q) The LAs with reporting mechanism for Millennium Development Goal (MDG) indicator
         targets (number)
      r) Funds lost to errors, fraud, and corruption: identified through audit exercise (percentage)
      s) The LAs publicly disclose revenues, such as grants and expenditures by MTR
         (percentage)

14.    AF 2 left the PDO unchanged. Additional results indicators were added on component
outputs:

      a) Beneficiaries who feel project investments reflected their needs (percentage)
      b) Grievances registered related to delivery of project benefits that are actually addressed
         (percentage)
3
  IDA 14 core indicators were systematically added across the Bank’s IDA portfolio to be able to report aggregate
results.

1.5 Main Beneficiaries

15.    Food-insecure households are the main beneficiaries of public works programs (PWPs)
under MASAF III APL II. The PWSPs provide a safety net mechanism for those who are poor and
with limited employment opportunities. The PWSPs are targeted at poor households as an annual
intervention to address food security-related shocks that affect these households around the time
they need cash to purchase agricultural inputs, grains, and other basic necessities.

16.     Poor communities were the main beneficiaries of the infrastructure and services created
through the PWSPs and community subprojects. AF 1 included restoring basic services and
infrastructure in communities affected by the 2010 earthquake.

17.    The institutional objectives of the project focused on building the capacity of Malawi’s 35
LAs as well as VDCs and ADCs. Additional beneficiaries include national-level institutions
associated with the capacity development of the LAs, such as the Ministry of Local Government
and Rural Development, and sectoral ministries.

1.6 Original Components

18.     MASAF III APL II is the title of the Bank-financed project implemented through the Local
Development Fund (LDF), managed by a Technical Support Team (TST). The project comprises
of three components in support of the three windows of the LDF.

a) Community Livelihoods Support Fund with two subcomponents:

   (i) Local Authority Fund: Based on local councils’ annual investment plans produced through
       village participatory planning, this subcomponent finances labor-intensive subprojects in
       afforestation, village access roads, small gravity irrigation projects, watershed management,
       soil conservation, solid waste disposal, water drainage systems, small-scale irrigation
       projects, and gravity-fed water supply. Individuals who will participate in the various PWSP
       are selected based on community-based targeting. At the outset, poor households received
       twelve days of work at MK 200 per day to address food security-related shocks that affected
       them around the time they needed to purchase agricultural inputs, grains, and other basic
       necessities.

   (ii) A Community Fund supports participatory planning processes and direct community
        financing to improve the functionality of existing educational facilities, in particular the
        construction of teachers’ houses and additional classrooms. This subcomponent also entails
        interventions to promote a culture of savings and investments (Community Savings
        Investment Promotion [COMSIP]), in particular among participants of the PWP, to enable
        them get on a pathway to graduating out of poverty. Voluntary savings groups received
        training to engage in savings and revolving credit.
b) Local Authority Capacity Enhancement Fund supports the development of a comprehensive
   framework for addressing capacity needs for the LAs to effectively manage the grants they
   receive, perform functions allocated to them, and prepare them to perform anticipated

                                                 5
   responsibilities as devolution and decentralization proceeds. This includes developing capacity
   in the areas of planning, financial management, and human resource management that would
   enable them to receive and manage development block grants as well as implement priority
   programs such as the PWSP on behalf of the national government.
c) National Institutional Strengthening Fund supports national-level cross-cutting issues aimed
   at improving accountability and transparency in the use of project resources. This includes: (a)
   a TST to oversee project implementation under the umbrella LDF and (b) knowledge generation
   and application, including monitoring and evaluation (M&E), as well as the preparation and
   dissemination to strengthen community participation in project implementation and document
   community experiences with service delivery.

1.7 Revised Components

19.    There were no changes in the components or other design features of the original project.
All AF was channeled through the original components.

1.8 Other Significant Changes

20.      There were two AF projects.

      (a) AF 1 (US$14 million from IDA funded from the crisis response window [CRW]) was
          approved on June 15, 2010 in response to the impact of the global economic crisis and natural
          disasters. The AF aimed to (i) develop, implement, and monitor a scaled-up public works-
          plus-savings and investment program to help alleviate the poverty, social, and economic
          impact of the crisis and (ii) provide financial assistance to protect core spending on
          education infrastructure investments through the reconstruction/retrofitting of education
          structures damaged in the Karonga and Chitipa earthquakes.
      (b) AF 2 (US$25 million grant and US$25 million credit) was approved on July 12, 2012 under
          the Rapid Response Program (RRP), as part of an overall US$150 million stabilization
          package which included additional support for MASAF III APL II, general budget support,
          and AF for an irrigation, rural livelihoods, and agricultural development project. The
          government had taken bold economic reforms in early 2012 after a change in leadership,
          including liberalizing Malawi’s foreign exchange regime and significant fuel and power
          price adjustments. The resulting inflation had severe effects on the poor, particularly due to
          rising food costs.


2.       KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

21.   Design factors. The project built on the experience of the long institutional trajectory of the
MASAF as well as the more immediate lessons learned from the implementation of the first phase
of MASAF III (APL I).

22.     Given the relatively uncertain pace and status of decentralization in Malawi, especially in
the light of the stalled political decision on local elections, APL II did not propose to finance
comprehensive policy reforms but rather lay the groundwork for the future using its community

                                                    6
driven development (CDD) approach to address synergies between communities and the local
government. In the short term, the transfer of project resources to the LAs to manage public works
stimulated and enhanced managerial capacities at that level, laying the groundwork for future
decentralization.

23.     Previous experience showed that public works cash transfers as part of drought response
had a major impact on community livelihoods and food security, solidifying the growing acceptance
of the need for social protection measures in response to shocks. An operational base had been
established, permitting a scale-up of coverage and impact.

24.     Previous phases of the MASAF had financed an extensive expansion of community-level
infrastructure (schools, health facilities, and water points), but the shortage of skilled personnel and
supplies reduced the impact of such investments. APL II focused less on creating new infrastructure
and shifted from an open menu approach to targeted infrastructure investments mainly for building
teacher housing which would not significantly increase recurrent costs but would have an impact
on retaining teachers in rural areas and improving educational quality.

25.     Assessment of risks. Project preparation identified a number of critical risks. The first of
these was the pace of decentralization. As mentioned above, the main strategy for controlling this
risk was to focus on developing LA readiness for greater responsibilities if and when those
materialize. Another key risk was the complexity of different sectors and actors involved in
implementation. The need for effective collaboration was to be addressed at the central government
level by a Steering Committee led by the Ministry of Finance and composed of senior officials from
all the key ministries. Given the prominent role of relatively weak LAs in channeling funds, a
further risk identified was the failure to implement because funds could be misapplied. The project
design addressed this by demanding accountability of funds used before any further funding can be
provided as well as emphasizing capacity building of the LAs.

26.     Overall quality at entry. Project preparation was carried out by a joint Bank-government
team that built on long-standing collaboration of social protection and CDD issues in Malawi.
Design and preparation activities addressed the main issues and sought to control outstanding risks.
The project was prepared in a short time frame, about six months, to respond to the immediate needs
of the population for social protection measures and because it could build on the base from APL
I. The project components were responsive to the country context and balanced between seeking to
deliver direct benefits to the poor and longer-term institutional goals.

2.2 Implementation

27.     Project funding and time frame. The original US$50 million project was approved by the
Board on June 20, 2008, signed on November 25, 2008, and became effective on March 24, 2009.
AF 1 (US$14 million) was approved on June 15, 2010 and AF 2 (US$50 million) on July 5, 2012,
bringing the total IDA envelope to US$114 million with an additional US$1.7 million in community
contributions. The original closing date of September 30, 2013 was changed to June 30, 2014 at the
time of AF 2 and the project closed on that date.

28.   Project implementation issues. Project implementation was rated Satisfactory or
Moderately Satisfactory throughout implementation. All issues that arose during implementation


                                                   7
were largely process-oriented rather than substantive in nature. For example, there were delays in
hiring of and changes to the executive director position of the TST and other personnel. Shortages
and delays in recruiting district-level procurement and financial management staff and overall high
turnover and reassignments at the district level were issues identified throughout implementation.

29.     Project implementation was also affected by external factors. Economic shocks and natural
disasters increased the level of vulnerable households and prompted the need for the AF to satisfy
these urgent needs. Moreover, the project lost a total of US$2.7 million due to appreciation of the
U.S. dollar against special drawing rights (SDR). Following economic liberalization, Malawi
experienced very high levels of inflation, reaching 38 percent in March 2013. This affected the
costs of subproject inputs. For example, the unit cost of a teacher’s house increased from
US$15,000 in 2008 to US$ 22,000 in 2010.

30.    Project changes/restructuring. An AF allowed for additional funds to be called forth to
address critical shocks, like economic crises and natural disasters. It also created an opportunity for
formal project restructuring of the project. At AF 1, the original PDO statement was edited to clarify
the main project development objective. Key performance indicators were added in both AF 1 and
AF 2 to respond to IDA corporate reporting needs and to capture a broader range of outputs and
outcomes.

31.    Some of the safety net parameters were altered in AF 2 to enhance the ability of the poor
and vulnerable households to cope with the negative effects of the economic reforms. Daily wage
rates were increased from MK 200 to MK 300. The allowable number days was increased from 12
to 48 days, with beneficiaries working for 12 days per month for two consecutive months in each
cycle compared to 12 days per year in the normal PWP. Coverage nearly tripled from 220,000
beneficiaries per year to 594,000 beneficiaries, and more predictable employment and income were
provided by targeting the same participants over the two cycles of the program.

32.     Midterm review. An MTR was conducted from January 9 to January 23, 2012. The main
issues identified were (a) the need to restructure the PWP to be a productive social safety net which
supports communities for more than one year to put them on a pathway to graduation (which was
supported by AF 2); (b) the need to better align the PDO indicators to the PDO statement (also
under AF 2); and (c) continued inadequate staffing capacity at the district level for financial
management, internal auditing, and procurement staff, which required the government's urgent
attention for the districts to effectively deliver on their development mandate.

33.     Project closing. At project closing on June 30, 2014, 95 percent of the project funds were
disbursed. The remaining balance was meant to fund a final round of public works. Initial
discussions identified a needed wage increase at the beginning of 2014 to address the erosion in the
real value of transfers over time. The effective purchasing power of the transfer had diminished due
to the inflation following economic liberalization measures. While a wage rate increase was
budgeted, the government ended up deciding not to raise rates, leaving some undisbursed funds.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

34.   M&E design was built on a solid platform of previous experience in the MASAF. The M&E
framework was based on a well-defined results framework and a comprehensive M&E plan with


                                                  8
clear roles and responsibilities. Monitoring would be supported by a management information
system which extended to the LA level. Periodic assessments and evaluations were to include
annual tracking studies, baseline studies, ex post evaluations, and impact evaluations. Participatory
community monitoring and accountability approaches and systems using citizen report cards
(CRCs) and community score cards (CSCs) were identified to ensure direct beneficiary feedback.

35.    Project monitoring was consistently carried out at the local levels through multisectoral
implementation support missions comprised of a team of 30 that visited the country’s 35 districts
every quarter, identified issues, and prepared a team report. A basic management information
system was maintained, though district-level inputs could not be fully automated due to the lack of
communications infrastructure in many rural districts.

36.    Annex 2 contains a list of the various evaluations done throughout project implementation.
The project was able to create a sufficient evaluative basis to draw conclusions about project
performance. Of note:

a) The MASAF developed a performance assessment system for the LAs which tracks seven
   functional areas of local government performance. The performance assessment measure
   (PAM) was tested in 2010 and then carried out in 2011, 2012, and 2013.
b) A CSC was carried out in 2010. District-level personnel were trained and the process covered
   14 of the country’s 35 districts. The exercise was expensive in terms of personnel and logistics
   and turned out to be time-intensive. It was found to be a better instrument to gauge general
   service delivery quality than specific project outcomes and was subsequently taken up by the
   Ministry of Planning.
c) Beneficiary assessments (BAs), public works tracking studies, technical audits, and impact
   assessments were contracted to external firms or carried out by multisectoral government
   teams. 5 The TST was able to incorporate the findings and adjust processes

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

37.     Safeguards. The MASAF III APL II project triggered four Safeguards Operational Policies:
OP/BP 4.01 - Environmental Assessment, OP 4.09 - Pest Management, OP/BP 4.12 - Involuntary
Resettlement, and OP/BP 4.36 - Forests. During MASAF III APL II, the responsibility for
safeguards implementation was transferred fully to the district level. However, there arose issues
of capacity to include environmental and social safeguards as part of the districts’ regular planning
and implementation processes. Given the large number of PWSPs, District Environmental
Subcommittees (DESCs) were challenged to do proper environmental and social screening and/or
develop Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs) for all subprojects in all
communities. The COMSIP program was more successful at mainstreaming safeguard
considerations into the business management aspects of the savings clubs formed.

38.    To address shortcomings, several actions were undertaken. The government recruited 27
environmental district officers (EDOs) to coordinate the social and environmental activities at the
LA level and to serve as secretary to the DESC. The project supported training for the EDOs, DESC,
and local extension officers. Recognizing that limited follow-up on mitigation measures was in part

    5

the Competing Goals of Investment and Food Security” – see section 6, “Lessons Learned”, for more details..

                                                       9
the result of a lack of earmarked funds, in 2012 the LDF allocated MK 50,000 per subproject for
overall support to safeguards implementation and monitoring. The Ministry of Environmental
Affairs and Climate Change began to undertake quarterly monitoring missions, which improved
screening and implementation of mitigating measures. In addition, the project initiated a pilot to
mainstream the use of soil stabilized bricks for building construction, as an alternative to baked
bricks which are currently most commonly used in Malawi for the construction of rural buildings.

39.     Procurement. At the national level, the TST was responsible mainly for the procurement
of the institutional support activities. At the local level, district staff were responsible for
contracting PWSPs and community-based project management committees (PMCs) for the social
infrastructure subprojects. MASAF I and II had previously developed the operational systems for
procurement at the local level and had proven that the local level, particularly that community
PMCs were well placed to carry out simple procurement responsibilities.

Overall, procurement functions were carried out in a satisfactory manner. The government’s Office
Director of Public Procurement rates all agencies on performance. The LDF has consistently
received the highest rating. The Bank carried out procurement reviews twice every year and found
that the system was solid, justifying an increase in prior review thresholds. In 2010–2011, there
were changes in procurement personnel in the TST and delays in recruitment that caused a
temporary downgrading of procurement performance. At the district level, the challenge was that
there were no official procurement officer positions. Therefore, training had to be conducted for
district public works engineers. In addition to district-level training, capacity building was carried
out directly by the Bank’s procurement staff through quarterly supervision and monthly clinics with
procurement officers from all Bank project offices.

40.     Financial management. Financial management was also carried out at the national, district,
and community levels. Statement of Expenditures (SOE) reviews were done consistently, including
financial management field visits jointly with the Bank and TST staff. Financial supervision reports
and audits were remitted in a timely fashion and found to be acceptable. There was significant
difficulty in administering the system in May 2011 when the existing software system crashed and
was considered inoperable. It took one year to switch to a more reliable system and reenter historical
data. During this transition year, financial management performance was downgraded and the Bank
decided there was insufficient technical backing to permit utilization of interim financial reports
(IFRs) so the system was changed to SOEs. Utilization of the SOEs was challenging in a
decentralized program due to delays in gathering all the necessary information to get
reimbursements.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

41.     Post-completion subproject operations and maintenance arrangements. Eligible
PWSPs were designed to be labor-intensive and generate few recurrent costs. For example, over
half of the PWSPs were in roads, focused on maintenance and repair of existing rural feeder roads
rather than building new roads. This was an acknowledgement of the systemic issues with road
maintenance that have plagued Malawi. The high labor intensity of the PWSPs meant that only
basic maintenance could be applied rather than any more significant investments. For example, in
bridges and culverts, basic maintenance could upgrade the status of the road and its durability.



                                                 10
42.     There has been some progress in addressing systemic issues in road maintenance at the
sectoral level, with the creation of the National Road Authority and the Road Fund Administration
in 2006 to provide dedicated funding for road maintenance. However, overall funding remains
inadequate. A tracking study found that local residents observed maintenance happening on only a
quarter of the completed roads. MASAF III APL II has helped fill the funding gap, providing
maintenance and repairs to a significant share of rural feeder roads in the country.

43.     Community subprojects were focused on building teacher housing and limited classroom
construction focused on repair and reconstruction of infrastructure affected by the earthquake.
Operation and maintenance is the responsibility of the Ministry of Education, with support from
local parent-teacher associations. The additional classrooms were replacements with teachers
typically already assigned, with few recurrent costs generated.

44.     The temporary income benefits from the PWSPs were designed to provide for immediate
consumption needs of the vulnerable population. The innovative feature of the COMSIP sought to
create a savings culture and mechanism for PWP beneficiaries to extend the economic impacts of
the temporary income to interested households. The COMSIP contributed positively to financial
saving behavior of group members with 84 percent of members reporting an increase in household
savings. Moreover, savings is used to lend for income-generating activities. The COMSIP model
requires a member to save 40 percent of their total money accumulated at the end of the year in the
group, unlike other models that guarantees the saver an opportunity to withdraw all savings. The
amount left in the group is security for the group to continue working and growing together. This
promotes the longer-term sustainability of the mechanism.

45.      Sustaining institutional capacity and follow-on operations. MASAF III APL II built
institutional capacity at several levels. The most important of these during the implementation of
MASAF III, given the significance of MASAF financing to local government administrative and
capital budgets, was the decentralization agenda spear headed by the Ministry of Local
Development and the Ministry of Finance to improve the procedures and process for the flow of
financing from the Central Government to the Local Authorities. MASAF III supported the,
Framework for Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfer System to support service delivery of local authority. In
addition MASAF III financed critical staffing such as in financial management at the Local Authority
District Offices to manage the finances. The LDF has been able to lobby with the Ministry of Local
Government and Rural Development (MLGRD) to fill critical positions. For example, about 5–10
percent of all internal auditor positions which were filled in the LAs are now filled to 100 percent
and procurement officers are now being deployed to all the LAs. The annual performance
assessment which the MASAF III instituted has now become a standard procedure for the GoM to
measure performance.

46.     The COMSIP savings groups were created and supported under MASAF III and over the
implementation period MASAF III supported COMSIP’s institutional sustainability through the
transition of the savings groups to clusters to formally constituted cooperatives. This cooperative
structure invests ownership shares, pays dividend, and organizes continuing capacity building. At
the national level, the COMSIP Cooperative Union Limited is a member-owned organization
registered under the Cooperative Societies Act No. 36 of 1998 to provide institutional support to
the COMSIP groups and cooperatives.



                                                   11
47.     The project was part of the IDA financing strategy using a three-phased APL instrument
(2003–2015) to improve service delivery efforts by communities supported by local governments
and sector ministries through a CDD approach. APL II was expected to satisfy the following three
triggers to get into APL III: (a) LAs able to set objectives and achieve their annual targets; (b)
annual PWP cycles completed according to plan; and (c) LAs with reporting mechanism for MDG
indicator targets. These triggers were achieved, but it was determined that given that the follow-on
operation would focus mainly on developing a national safety net system, it would be considered a
new program rather than a continuation of the APL series.

48.     A follow-on operation, Strengthening Safety Net Systems – MASAF IV (US$32.8 million
IDA credit), was approved on December 18, 2013. Building on the experience of MASAF III APL
II, the new project is designed as a second generation safety net system that builds a safety net
platform to harmonize, coordinate, and deliver safety nets based on the experience of the LDF
mechanism as well as more recent approaches underway in the country on a unified registry system.
It would continue to fund PWSPs as well as the COMSIP program and would add a social cash
transfer program for labor-restrained households building on experiences of other donors in
Malawi. MASAF IV would harmonize and coordinate the approaches, targeting, and systems of
these programs and would continue to be implemented through the LDF TST.

3.     ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: Satisfactory

49.     Relevance of objectives. Project objectives were highly relevant to the country context at
the time of appraisal and remained relevant throughout. The safety net focus addressed the needs
of the chronically food-insecure populations and community-based funding of essential social
infrastructure. In particular, teacher housing addressed a core sectoral issue that was impeding
quality education in the rural areas. MASAF III APL II was aligned with the prevailing poverty
reduction and economic growth strategy of the GoM and the Bank’s CAS.

50.     Relevance of design. Relevance of design was substantial. Project design was built on an
experience of the MASAF as the main safety net and CDD organization in the country. The safety
net design reflected global best practice for its attention to timing with agricultural cycles, high
labor intensity, targeting approach using community-based selection, and below market wages to
ensure the most vulnerable benefitted. Design was tailored to the specific opportunities and
constraints of the decentralization process in Malawi. Successful innovations, like COMSIP, were
scaled up. As the Malawi social assistance system developed, the design kept reflecting this
evolution in the next stages of the project design.

51.     Relevance of implementation. Implementation remained sensitive to the changing context
in the country. Most importantly, two AFs were processed to address immediate social protection
needs from economic shocks and natural disasters. While most of the ongoing Bank supervision
(ISRs) evaluated implementation as Moderately Satisfactory, a review of the issues in the ISRs
shows that the ratings resulted from different (not recurring) issues, that were addressed in the



                                                12
course of implementation. Therefore, the overall relevance of the implementation is considered
substantial.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Satisfactory

52.     The project aimed to reach the poor and vulnerable with temporary income, social
infrastructure, and savings mobilization in the context of improved local governance and public
sector management. The results chain posits that providing short-term temporary employment
through public works can provide a social protection benefit to help vulnerable households cope
with chronic poverty and transient shocks. Moreover, this short-term injection of income can create
longer-term impacts on household economic well-being through savings mobilization and
investment. These are particularly important given that it was a period of time when the country
faced a number of shocks and the project played a role in helping communities cope with the shocks
(see Section 1.2 above). At the institutional level, through a combination of learning by doing and
capacity building, the LAs would be able to effectively take on greater development responsibilities
leading to the government being more responsive to local communities over the longer-term.

53.   According to the August 2006 ICR Guidelines (revised October 5, 2011), the project
outcome should be assessed against both the original 6 and revised 7 PDOs.

Assessing achievement of project development objectives prior to restructuring
54.     Prior to the rewording of the PDO at AF 1, the project was on track to achieve its
development objectives. The project had disbursed US$24.3 million, equivalent to 51 percent of
the original credit or 21 percent of the total final project cost. The results framework included two
PDO indicators.


        PDO Indicators Prior to Restructuring                       Status as of Restructuring

                                                      2008/2009 and 2009/2010 PWP cycles reached 546,758
     At least 120,000 households annually increase    households from the two public works cycles, more than
     their average incomes (40% females).             twice the targeted number of 240,000 households (47%
                                                      females).

     At least 70 percent of the LAs are able to set

     objectives and achieve at least 70 percent of

  Original PDO: “To improve the livelihoods of poor households within the framework of improved local governance
at community, local authority, and national levels.”

55.     The restructuring was not substantive in nature and project components remained
unchanged. Since all indicators met their targets as of the restructuring date, this portion of the
project is rated Satisfactory. The bulk of the analysis of achievement of the PDOs will focus on
status and impacts as of the end of the project.

Assessing achievement of project development objectives at project closing
56.     A summary of outputs is available in annex 2. Project outcomes were focused on four areas:
(a) provision of temporary employment and income through safety net cash-for-work; (b) longer-
term income effects through savings mobilization, (c) improved access to basic services through
community-driven basic infrastructure, and (d) enhanced LAs’ capacity to manage development.
All PDO indicators were substantially achieved and most were significantly surpassed.

Provision of temporary employment and income through safety net cash-for-work

57.     MASAF III APL II generated 47 million person days over the life of the project. These
safety net investments benefitted 2.2 million households cumulatively over 9 public works cycles.
Each public works cycle reached an average of about 434,000 beneficiary households or about 15
percent of households nationwide, a relatively high coverage rate for safety net PWPs. These
outputs had significant positive impacts on participating households. The BA found that 89 percent
of the PWP respondents indicated that the PWP had contributed positively to household welfare.
Impacts were noted in the following areas:

   •   Improved food security: The BA (2011) and the Second Tracking Study (2012) reported that
       58 percent and 54 percent of beneficiaries, respectively, used public works cash earnings to
       meet immediate food needs. Over 740,000 public works beneficiaries were able to buy
       agricultural inputs following participation in the public works, surpassing the project target.
       Evaluations confirmed that the PWP households increased their spending on farm inputs, in
       particular fertilizer. The Second Tracking Study recorded improvements in maize
       production per hectare from 13 to 27 bags.
   •   Improved living conditions: Twenty-nine percent of beneficiaries moved from temporary
       houses (grass thatched, unburnt bricks; poles; and mud structures) to more permanent
       structures.
   •   Access to education services: About 10 percent of the beneficiaries used their earnings to
       pay for children’s education and other education-related expenses.
   •   Access to health services: Cash payments enabled access to health care as beneficiaries
       reported to have paid for medical bills using the PWP earnings.
   •   Accumulation of assets: Tracing studies also found that 11 percent of public works
       beneficiary households spent cash on household assets.

58.     There is some evidence of increased impact with the shift to greater number of days per year
for households in AF 2. With participation in two cycles in the year, more beneficiaries were able
to save some of their earnings. However, it was difficult for workers to commit to full participation
in both cycles due to competing demands from their small-holder plots and small businesses. About
30 percent of the same workers participated in the multiple cycles with most choosing to rotate
through the multiple cycles in the same year.



                                                 14
Longer-term income effects through savings mobilization

59.     The COMSIP program offered services to savings and investments groups that were formed
following participation in PWSPs. The theory was that these cash payments could prompt longer-
term savings and investments by poor households if they were accompanied with training and social
mobilization. At project closing, almost 100,000 households were members of the COMSIP saving
groups. The project supported the formation of 4,465 groups (30–35 members), 1,106 clusters (3–
5 groups), and 135 cooperatives comprising clusters that have saved sufficient amounts and wished
to become a more formalized organization. A total of 3,685 groups received training grants for
training in financial literacy, business management, and environmental and social safeguards. The
aggregate volume of savings mobilized during the life of the project was estimated at MK 1.34
billion (US$2.7 million at current exchange rates).

60.    The formation of these savings and investment groups had a positive impact on the well-
being of the participating households. Based on a self-assessment of poverty, the percentage of
members who reported to be better-off was higher with the years in existence of the savings group,
from 67 percent for older groups to 48 percent for newer groups. Specific outcomes include the
following:

   •   Increases in savings: Seventy-nine percent of members reported savings of at least 50
       percent of their public works wages one year after participation, surpassing the project
       target.
   •   Increases in income: Per the COMSIP impact assessment, 39 percent of beneficiaries
       attested to income gains from the COMSIP activities. Impacts were higher in the groups
       that received more extensive COMSIP training.
   •   Improved food security and social protection of the household: These income gains
       translated into half of the beneficiaries stating that they now had more food/maize. Twenty-
       nine percent of the COMPSIP households found that they now had recourse to savings to
       help with family emergencies. All respondents reported that they had bought at least one
       household asset the past year, using the COMSIP savings and loans as well as business
       income.
   •   Access to credit: The COMSIP improved access to loans for group members. The
       percentage of members with access to loans increased over time. For example, from 57
       percent for recently formed groups to 85 percent for groups with several years’ experience,
       with frequency of borrowing between two and three times. The average loan value was MK
       11,864.
   •   Promotion of entrepreneurship culture: The COMSIP groups used loans mainly for starting
       a business or buying business stock/working capital and purchasing agricultural inputs.
       Thirty-eight percent of beneficiaries stated that they had expanded their business activities
       because of the COMSIP.

Improved access to basic services through community-driven basic infrastructure

61.     MASAF III APL II created or repaired a substantial number of public assets in poor
communities through labor-intensive public works and community-driven social infrastructure
subprojects. The project financed 39,706 PWSPs, over half of which were in roads (100,000 km),
afforestation (6,500 ha), irrigation (5,500 ha), environmental sanitation (2,050 ha), land

                                                15
conservation (2,100 ha), and fisheries (1,900). Community-based social infrastructure subprojects
included 871 teachers’ houses, 200 classrooms, and 16 VIP latrines.

62.       Impacts of these infrastructure investments include:

      •   Roads: The technical audit found improved access in rural communities which positively
          contributed to improvements in the rural economy.
      •   Teacher housing: The BA found that staff houses constructed under the project contributed
          to improvements in both teacher and student performance. Over half of the teachers moved
          from houses that leaked during the rains, affecting their preparedness. Two-thirds indicated
          that they had more time to prepare for lessons due to electricity availability. Ninety-nine
          percent of teachers occupying staff houses expressed satisfaction with the houses, which is
          a key motivating factor for improved performance.
      •   Classrooms: The technical audit study indicated that the project has contributed to better
          quality of education as enrollment of pupils in schools improved due to increased and
          improved infrastructure.

Strengthened local authorities’ capacity to manage development

63.      MASAF III APL II had a broader institutional objective of supporting capacity development
at the local level. With over a decade of experience in directly funding the communities, the project
represented a gradual evolution toward greater support of and responsibilities devolved to the LAs
in part as a way to support the country’s decentralization trajectory.. The project supported the LAs
and communities through learning-by-doing that is, transferring direct subproject management
responsibilities to them as well as through training and capacity building. Training was provided to
over 40,000 local personnel in various core functional topics. For example, MASAF previously
financed an accountant position in each LA to support sub-project fiduciary activities. With this
project, district administrative staff took over disbursement and reporting responsibilities. The
Project also sought to support district level participatory planning efforts, including the creation of
district development plans. The PDO indicator in this area, that least 70 percent of local authorities
were able to set objectives and achieve at least 70 percent of their annual targets by midterm review,
was fully achieved.

64.      MASAF III APL II was instrumental in developing and testing Malawi’s fiscal transfer
system, including supporting the technical work in developing the design of a fiscal transfer and
capital grants system. Financial and project management computerized systems were developed for
districts as a whole and not just for the MASAF project. And more importantly, the LDF served as
the initial test for actually transferring capital funding to the district level. . The LDF succeeded in
becoming a recognized conduit for other donor financing, amounting to US$245 million committed
toward various activities in the four windows of the LDF. 8 Based on the success of community-
managed school infrastructure subprojects, the Ministry of Education has taken the policy decision
that all primary school construction, whether financed externally or through the national budget,

8
  The commitments include Malawi government MK 5.4 billion (US$38.7 million); Education Sector Wide Approach
(ESWAP) MK 16 billion (US$50 million); World Bank US$114 million; African Development Bank US$27.7 million;
and KfW €11 million (US$15 million).


                                                    16
should adopt the MASAF community-driven approach and be channeled through the LDF. To date,
the LDF community window manages sector-wide primary schools investment activities, with the
total funding between 2012 and 2013 equivalent to US$36.9 million.

65.     There has been some noted improvement in the LA performance. The PAM was used
annually to measure capacity in several key areas (participatory planning and budgeting, financial
management, procurement, service delivery, supervision, and M&E). The composite performance
of councils improved from 37 points in 2010 to 46 points in 2013. In 2013, the highest scores were
in procurement and M&E, with the lowest scores in financial management. Despite this progress,
the assessment pointed to weaknesses in vacant positions of key personnel as well as the slow pace
of the human resource devolution, continued high level of reassignments, and lack of equipment
for data collection. These issues need to be addressed from a decentralization perspective and
extend beyond the ability of a single project like the MASAF to correct.

The Counterfactual
66.     While it is not easy to construct a quantitative counterfactual, it can be concluded with a
high level of certainty that without the project a huge number of Malawi’s poor would have been
worse off, would have received no poverty-targeted direct cash and food support, fewer
opportunities to improve the assets of their communities, fewer opportunities to get on a graduation
path out of poverty, and weaker local government mechanisms for outreach. The safety net
programs that functioned in Malawi prior to MASAF would not have been Government led, and
would have remained as scattered and varied agendas and definitions of development goals.
Without MASAF, the ravages of HIV/AIDS in that time frame, also causing a decimated national
capacity to deliver services, would have been even more catastrophic. In the face of the negative
effects of HIV/AIDS MASAF provided a secure and stable highly professional and consistent
delivery mechanism to reach each and every district and its most vulnerable populations with
income and food security and a sense of hope. Without the project, more than 2 million poor
households may not have increased their average annual incomes. More than 78,000 poor would
not have been able to save, and at least 300,000 to 400,000 poor would not have been able to provide
for their needed agricultural inputs. Looking at the indicators for the community investments and
savings group, it can also be concluded that close to 100,000 people (among which close to 70%
women) would not have been able to get on a sustainable path out of poverty if it weren’t for the
project. The project also improved the capacity of local authorities and without it 30% of the local
authorities would not have been able to set objectives and achieve their targets.

3.3 Efficiency

67.    As presented in annex 4, the project was efficient. Public works safety net program
parameters were consistent with best practice for efficiency with high labor intensity, low
administrative costs, below-market wages to promote effective targeting, and broad coverage. Unit
costs of the constructed social infrastructure was less than comparator projects. The COMSIP
program reports continued increases in savings mobilization and generally high repayment rates
from the on-lending to group members.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

                                                17
68.     The project was relevant to the country context and in line with the government’s economic
growth and poverty reduction strategy and the CAS of the Bank. It was agile in responding to
economic shocks and natural disasters as they arose. There is ample evidence to confirm
achievement of the PDO to improve the livelihoods of poor and vulnerable households and to
strengthen the capacity of the LAs to manage local development.

69.     Applying the split evaluation rating, efficacy in meeting development objectives was
substantial both prior to and following restructuring. Relevance and economic efficiency were
substantial and consistent throughout the full implementation period. Therefore, the overall
outcome rating for both the pre- and post-restructuring portions of MASAF III APL II is rated as
Satisfactory, per Table 1.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

70.     Poverty impacts. Public works were targeted at the poor. For example, 87 percent of the
households used to run out of food before the next harvest when they first entered the program,
only 15 percent had gone beyond primary school, and 8 percent relied on skilled employment and
fishing meaning that as many as 92 percent relied on piece works, small-scale businesses, and
farming as small holder farmers.

71.     Income transfers were not designed to be sufficient in and of themselves to lift households
out of poverty, but provided an important protective element to prevent destitution, support critical
expenditures (for example on health and education), and accumulate basic assets. These actions
over the longer term contribute to poverty reduction. Through investments in small businesses and
purchase of productive assets, whether group or individual based, the COMSIP program has
provided an additional path toward poverty reduction for the poor.

72.     Gender. Women were prime beneficiaries of MASAF III APL II. The selection of public
works participants was expected to be gender sensitive as specified in the 2010 project
implementation manual. Program eligibility required that at least 40 percent of public works
participants be women. Actual performance surpassed this, with women representing 51 percent of
public works beneficiaries. In addition, 61 percent of the COMSIP members were women. The
COMSIP program also included a focus on empowerment and leadership, including orientation on


                                                 18
gender-based violence issues. The COMSIP impact assessment found that participation in the
COMSIP contributed to a decline in physical violence against women in their families.

73.     Social development. The project used participatory techniques and promoted social
inclusion. Transparency at the local level was furthered through the use of social audits, public
posting of approved projects and other information, and a hotline for any complaints. Within the
COMSIP program, members committed to eight responsibilities, one of which was the elimination
of social injustice. The project also sought to mainstream participatory aspects of governance
through its technical support to the LAs. Training in participatory planning and budgeting and the
application of social safeguards was provided to the LAs. The PAM system revealed steady
progress in the application of participatory planning and budgeting throughout the lifetime of the
project, with national composite scores rising from 45 to 61 points in this functional area.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

74.     At the national level, the MASAF/LDF continues to be one of the more efficient and
effective government institutions in Malawi. The project supported institutional advancements in
two areas principally. First, the project consolidated the MASAF/LDF’s social protection role as a
crisis scale-up vehicle. And second, MASAF III APL II was the key vehicle to operationalize the
LDF mechanism, the core fiscal transfer mechanism to support eventual decentralization of capital
budgets. Apart from the MASAF/LDF itself, there were institutional impacts on other national-
level institutions. The project developed the PAM tool that is now used by the MLGRD as a
standard to evaluate local government functional capacity

75.     MASAF III APL II had a significant institutional impact at the local level. For the first time
in Malawi, the LAs were given an indicative planning figure and transparent allocations that they
could link to their local development plans. MASAF III APL II remains the most significant
development budget that the LAs directly manage. In addition, the project was responsible for most
of the training of the LA technical staff carried out in the country, including M&E officers,
accounting officers, public works staff, and so on. The project encouraged team work and
collaboration by establishing multisectoral district teams, whereas earlier sectoral reporting was
directly to the central level with little collaboration across sectors. Moreover, the LDF has become
a strong lobbying voice for the central government to increase staffing allocation to the LAs, with
some effectiveness.

76.     On the private side, the COMSIP has gone beyond the basic formation of savings groups to
creating clusters and ultimately cooperatives. These cooperatives are part of a cooperative union
that has created a stronger and more formal institutional structure, including ownership of shares
by members. These cooperatives have also begun to access commercial credit, for example, from
the Malawi Development Fund.

77.    At the community level, MASAF III APL II continued the tradition of training and
empowering community groups in program management, project formulation, implementation,
M&E, financial management, and procurement. The BA reported that the skills and experiences
gained by the PMCs have given them confidence to attract and manage other development projects.
Other programs have used the same committees (United Nations Children’s Fund [UNICEF],
nongovernmental organizations).


                                                 19
4.     ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

Rating: Moderate

78.     The government remains firmly committed to continuing and scaling up the achievements
of MASAF III APL II under the new operation. Institutional capacity developed under the project
will help support sustainability of the impacts.

5.     ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

79.     The Bank team worked closely with the government to prepare the project in a timely
fashion. The Bank preparation team had a good skill mix, adequately supporting the technical needs
of the project. Please note that the Bank helped develop the social protection lens, bringing in
international and regional experience in safety nets to inform design. Fiduciary readiness was
confirmed during preparation, building on the MASAF’s experience in managing Bank funding.
Risks were adequately identified and mitigated. For example, the overall lack of funding for
recurrent costs had hampered effectiveness of previously constructed schools and health centers.
The eligible menu of community subprojects was limited to address this issue.

80.    There were some minor shortcomings in ensuring quality at entry. The PDO could have
been more clearly worded, prompting a rewording at AF 1. Nonetheless, the overall results
readiness of the M&E framework was rated above the average in a results readiness portfolio review
of all Bank social protection operations in FY2005–2009. Also, MASAF III APL II project
appraisal document was selected among the cohort of projects reviewed to provide good practice
examples of results frameworks, results monitoring tables, and institutional M&E arrangements.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

81.     During the ICR mission, the government commented universally that the Bank team was
very responsive during implementation. Bank supervision was effective in focusing on continual
capacity development, for example, through regional study tours and incorporation into the Bank’s
topical courses. Fiduciary supervision went beyond ensuring compliance to seeking to build
government skills in this area. For example, the Bank’s procurement specialist in the country office
held quarterly procurement clinics inviting all procurement officers, which created a network of
government procurement specialists who could support each other. In terms of safeguards, every
mission brought a safeguards specialist. The Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) were used
proactively to highlight key issues and downgrade performance where necessary.




                                                20
82.    There were some minor shortcomings in supervision. The Bank has been slow to reinstate
using IFRs despite the installation and operations of a new, more robust accounting system. This
may be overcautious given the added administrative burden of processing the SOEs in such a
decentralized program. Also, although a safeguard specialist was included in the team, the Bank
could have paid closer attention to implementation of a simplified environmental checklist for
PWSPs even though these were mostly repair and maintenance programs.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

83.   The Bank task team ensured quality at entry and provided effective supervision throughout
implementation.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

84.     The government has been highly supportive of the project and considers the MASAF as a
flagship program of poverty reduction in the country. The government prioritized the extension of
safety nets to its vulnerable populations, including two AF operations to increase funding in
response to economic shocks and natural disasters. The Ministry of Finance was able to mobilize
significant additional donor funding to be channeled through the nascent LDF mechanism
supported by the project, increasing its legitimacy and profile as the main decentralization
mechanism.

85.     There were minor shortcomings in government performance. These were mainly external
factors not specifically directed to the project but that nonetheless had an impact on implementation.
For example, the lack of elected local leaders between 2003 and 2013 weakened the legitimacy of
the LAs as expressing the will and preferences of their citizens. Delays in staffing and disruptive
transferring of staff continued to adversely affect local government capacity. The Local Authority
Service Commission is now in place and has started to recruit staff and implement some needed
human resource reforms. Economic liberation measures included the devaluation of the Malawi
kwacha by about 50 percent which inflated the unit costs of subprojects.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

86.     The TST of the LDF was the main implementing agency. The TST was highly committed
and retained sufficient technical staff to effectively oversee project implementation. In particular,
the team was able to manage a complex operation working through a decentralized structure with
many implementing partners of varying capabilities. The TST provides technical support to the LAs
to improve their performance. The TST responded quickly to the demands of preparing two AF
operations within crisis contexts. Procurement, financial management, and auditing functions were
carried out in compliance with project rules and operating procedures. Also, the M&E framework

                                                 21
was effectively followed, including reporting on key indicators and undertaking a significant
number of studies and evaluations that created a sufficient basis for proving impact and improving
operations.

87.    There were minor shortcomings in performance. Financial management suffered from the
computer crash of the accounting program resulting in the shift to using the SOEs which
encumbered the disbursement process. Execution of public works cycles were often delayed by a
month or two versus the planned calendar. There were delays in appointment of key personnel.
Planning of expenditures in the final year could not be fully achieved, leading to cancellation of
remaining balances. Also, despite significant attention on mainstreaming environmental screening
by the LAs and by community groups implementing the COMSIP investments, as well as the
additional mitigation funding to subproject costs, the PWSPs could have benefitted from more
systematic review.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

88.    Both government and implementing agency performance is rated as Satisfactory. Any
shortcomings did not affect the overall achievement of the PDOs.


6.     LESSONS LEARNED

Lessons learned in public works safety net interventions

89.     MASAF III APL II confirms the feasibility and impact of a large-scale safety net in Malawi.
This adds to the body of evidence on the potential for safety nets in low income countries and in
the Africa Region in particular as an essential component to stabilize household incomes in the face
of shocks and chronic poverty.

90.     Safety net program parameters face trade-offs between cost, coverage, generosity, and
durability of the infrastructure created. There is no right formula for this, but rather it depends on
the country’s circumstance and priorities. The project began with 12 days of public works
employment per participant, lower wage rates, and high labor intensity to distribute the income
benefits as widely as resources would allow. As shocks called for both greater need and greater
resources, coverage was scaled up, wage rates were increased, and the number of eligible days went
from 12 to 48 per year. High labor intensity increased the share of costs going to household
transfers, but in the case of rural roads it limits interventions to maintenance rather than any
significant upgrading in the quality of the road itself. In general, safety net programs should
experiment with these parameters to find the correct mix as they face changing circumstances.

91.    Malawi’s public works safety net achieved significant participation from women. The focus
on unskilled labor, largely road maintenance and afforestation, at less than market wages tended to
increase women’s participation, as well as clear program guidelines and outreach to promote
women’s access.



                                                 22
92.     A recent yet incomplete research 9 on the outcomes of the PWP under MASAF III brought
up some controversial aspects and was reviewed by the ICR team. As noted by the research team,
the assessment has some data and methodological issues that resulted in inconclusive findings.
Nonetheless, the preliminary analysis of MASAF III indicated that some of the effects may pose
questions as to how the program influenced the food security and the use of agricultural inputs by
the participating and non-participating communities. The studies also indicate that the number of
days of work and the amounts of cash transferred may have been too small to have an influence.
While inconclusive, this evidence was already used as a lesson in the design of MASAF IV, which
increases the focus on an integrated Social Protection System, increases the number of days worked,
adds in social cash transfers to targeted poor, finances community support and investment groups
and modifies the PWP to make it more focused and targeted for better effects on the most vulnerable
to enable them to graduate out of poverty.

93.      Finally, public works will definitely remain an important part of the social assistance tool
kit in the country. The PWP is scalable in times of crisis and can be directed to the right geographic
locations and target groups. However, more local level capacity building will be needed to ensure
predictability in terms of timing of payments as well as identifying the chronic poor for longer-term
inclusion within the annual PW cycles.

Lessons learned in mobilizing savings

94.     Voluntary savings by individuals and households should be encouraged as an asset
building and risk diversification, risk insurance and investment promotion opportunity. Savings
groups should be demand driven. The level of household savings can provide a tangible indicator
of graduation capability of a household. Malawi’s COMSIP program is an innovative example of
extending safety net benefits into activities to further promote graduation. It has a unique focus on
voluntary mobilization of savings first. Savings provide an important component of self-insurance
against future shocks as well as an asset base to grow investments. Rules concerning buying shares
of the group and requiring minimum savings levels ensures that this is not seen as a handout.
Credit comes only after there is buy-in. It is clear that not all safety net participants are in the same
position or have the same level of interest in participating in savings groups. However, the
COMSIP has continued to expand and has deepened the impact of the safety net program.

95.    Training has been shown to be an important aspect of the COMSIP success. The impact
assessment found that performance is stronger in most aspects for the 41 percent of groups that
have been supported by the COMSIP training programs. Demand for the more intensive training
modules surpassed available funding. Given the high return on these training activities, future
funding for training in the COMSIP should be a priority.

Lessons learned in community-driven social infrastructure

96.     The project continued to affirm over a decade of experience with community-based
management of small-scale infrastructure. This phase limited the eligible menu of subprojects in
part to mitigate the risk of lack of recurrent cost funding from the central government, and in part
to respond to a gap of financing and a request from the Government. While this limited community

choice, it resulted in needed investments, like expansion of rural teachers’ housing and replacement
of classrooms destroyed by the earthquake, without overburdening the national budget. Once the
need for these specific types of investments was gone, however, the project (e.g. the next phase
MASAF IV) returned to a wider array of community choices.

Lessons learned in capacity development

97.     The capacity development under MASAF III was mainly targeted at the local levels. The
issue of the pace of decentralization was important to a project like MASAF III APL II but was
outside of its direct control. Decentralization in Malawi has been more aspirational that operational.
MASAF III APL II has been key in helping the government work out operational systems and build
confidence in the district level. For example, at the outset, there was little confidence in the central
government about the viability of transferring funds for direct management by district offices. Now,
the LDF mechanism has channeled multiple donor and government programs to the LAs.

98.     The MASAF built capacity of districts to respond to demands of communities—with or
without decentralization. Even with limited decentralization, the local levels can constructively
engage and manage investments. The project built local capacity in two ways, both of which are
important. Learning-by-doing through direct management of project planning, implementation by
local governments and communities, and training programs reinforced this capacity development.

99.     A couple of more general lessons can also be derived from the project’s implementation.
Firstly, it should be mentioned that a type of massive intervention as MASAF, which basically
serves as a main social protection program of the country, should be accompanied by or integrated
with a broader option for policy dialogue. By virtue of sheer size and importance, MASAF III was
influenced by policy decisions. Projects of that type should not only be recipients but also shaping
agents of policy, which could be done through including a subcomponent for policy dialogue, or
linking the project to a separate source of funding for policy analysis and dialogue. Secondly, even
though Malawi will continue to require a good social protection program it is important to look at
ensuring financial sustainability through increased domestic allocations to the program. As part of
implementing the successor project, the Bank should engage with the authorities about ensuring
financial sustainability.

                          ANNEX 3. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Cost effectiveness of safety net transfers

1.      The cost effectiveness of the safety net transfers are a function of the accuracy of targeting,
the labor intensity of the public works, wage rate, and the general overhead costs of the program.
Together these determine the overall share of program resources that actually reach the poor
through transfers.

2.      MASAF III APL II cost effectiveness of transfers is high.

     a) Accurate targeting of beneficiaries, with over 80 percent of beneficiaries having
        characteristics consistent with the ultra-poor, meant there was very little leakage to the non-
        poor.
     b) The high labor intensity, on average 80 percent, was based on a restrained list of eligible
        subprojects that ensured that only high labor intensive investments were made and overhead
        costs were relatively low (14 percent over APL II including a valuation for all government
        staff working on the program as well as all institutional support expenditures). This
        compares favorably with international experience in cost-effective PWPs.
     c) Wage rates were set below market rates, rising from MK 200 to MK 300 over the course of
        implementation compared to the current government minimum wage of MK 550.
     d) By shifting to multiple cycles per year, the average annual transfer to a beneficiary increased
        from MK 2,400 (12*MK 200) to MK 14,200 (48*MK 300) for workers who participated
        fully throughout the year.
     e) Administrative overheads were very low by international standards. The National
        Institutional Strengthening Fund was 10 percent of total project costs, and included both
        administrative costs as well as institutional strengthening to central level agencies and the
        project’s M&E activities. The LDF retained 5 percent for those funding the sector-wide
        classroom construction program.

Cost effectiveness of the infrastructure investments

3.      According to the technical audit, a comparison between the MASAF/LDF approach and
other construction models shows that the MASAF approach is more cost effective for constructing
similar projects as compared with other partners. For example, the cost of a block with two
classrooms which was fitted with 60 desks was about US$22,000 under the MASAF/LDF
mechanism. A similar classroom block constructed under the Education Infrastructure Management
Unit (EIMU) of the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology costs about US$27,095,
excluding 35 percent of external works and consultancy fees (US$9,483). This implies that the
EIMU approach is 66 percent higher than the MASAF/LDF approach, yet it does not include desks
as is currently the case with the MASAF/LDF approach. Likewise, for a teacher’s house, the unit
cost under the MASAF/LDF approach is US$25,000 while under the EIMU it is about US$30,240
plus 35 percent for external works and consultant’s fees. Even with these cost savings, the quality
of community subprojects like schools and teacher housing was found to be good on average in the
technical audit.

Economic analysis of COMSIP activities

4.       The COMSIP program does not provide funding directly for credit and business investment
activities, rather this comes from members’ savings. The COMSIP only funds training and social
mobilization. The COMSIP groups charge an interest of between 10 and 30 percent on individual
member loans. This is lower cost capital than either micro-finance institutions or private money
lenders.

5.      There is no aggregate data collected on repayment rates for the COMSIP internal lending to
members, though anecdotal reports suggest high repayment rates supported by the tight bonds and
social control as well as the savings requirement for all members. Several indicators point to the
viability of the businesses created and the solvency of most COMSIP groups.

   •   The COMSIP co-operatives have been experiencing a steady growth in recent years, both
       in terms of membership and savings.
   •   The impact assessment found that the COMSIP has a positive impact on the level of
       savings by individual members. The study found that on average members from old
       supported groups have four times the amount of savings than new members.
   •   About 70 percent of the COMSIP members access loans through the group, and on
       average have repaid and taken out credit a second time.
   •   The majority of business investments by the COMSIP savers has been in the areas of
       selling of food crops, cash crops, livestock, milk, and fish.
   •   There is no data on the number of potential savings groups that have dissolved. Due to the
       rules and structure of the program, groups have generally been sustainable. Performance is
       stronger for the 41 percent of groups that have been supported by the COMSIP training
       programs.

                                MASAF III APL II PROJECT

                             PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

1.     PROJECT CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN

1.1    Project Context at Appraisal

At the time of Project design the population of Malawi was about 12.8 million people spread over
the area of 118,484 square kilometers, with 85% living in the rural areas. More than 51 percent of
the population lived below the poverty line of whom 22% was ultra-poor and 30% asset poor but
with labour surplus.

The Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS II) recognizes that strong and sustainable
economic growth is key to reducing poverty and emphasizes Social Protection as one of the main
areas of focus, a key ingredient for economic growth in an environment where poverty is prevalent.

In order to achieve Social Protection objectives, such as protecting the livelihoods of the most
vulnerable, food security, improving lives of persons living with chronic illnesses and others, the
Social Protection programs in Malawi were designed with a long term view. Repeated shocks and
depletion of assets is prevalent in rural areas of Malawi leading to pervasive vulnerability.
Economic shocks have also exposed urban populations to vulnerability and poverty is increasing
rapidly in the urban areas than in the rural areas.

Government of Malawi (GoM) through the MASAF III APL II Project has made concerted efforts
to move towards long term predictable social protection programs that help the poor households
deal with risks and shocks in a coordinated and institutionalized approach. Guided by the Malawi
Social Protection Policy, the designing, funding and implementation of Social Protection projects
has changed.

MASAF’s contribution to the country’s SP agenda has helped GoM to develop and implement
sophisticated methodologies for poverty and vulnerability targeting; it has also helped build
capacities of Local Authorities to involve and focus programming on poor and vulnerable
households; it has also empowered communities so that they are heard and represented in decision
making arenas and designed monitoring and evaluation systems for social protection indicators.


                                                 36
The objectives and design of the MASAF 3 APL II have also helped to mainstream social protection
programs across sectors at the national and local level. It has also strengthened the delivery of social
services in line with decentralization at the Local Authority level.

In January 2008, the GoM prepared and circulated a Position Paper on the LDF that laid out the
institutional architecture and the basis for financing local development using four windows of the
LDF. The Fund was created to foster local government capacity building and promotion of
transparency and accountability in the delivery of services by inputting the results from annual
assessment exercise into a Capacity Development Program of the Ministry of Local Government
and Rural Development.

1.2    RATIONALE FOR SEEKING WORLD BANK SUPPORT

The GoM sought World Bank support for a Social Fund in 1995 for MASAF I as part of a strategy
to support Social Dimensions of Adjustment as economic reforms got underway after the 1994
elections. A second phase of the MASAF commenced in 1998 when MASAF I was fully committed
without meeting the expressed community demand. The MASAF I and II Projects received a total
of US$120 million between 1995 and 2002 to support the construction of schools, water points,
bridges, clinics and other small investments implemented by communities; Public works
implemented by Local Authorities. Over 8,000 community sub-projects had been completed but
there was still a large unmet demand for similar investments.

Government of Malawi then developed a Community Empowerment and Development Project in
2003 called MASAF 3 to be implemented over a 12 year period to support the evolution of Local
Authorities to support direct financing of community projects while at the same time building the
capacity of the Local Authorities. The Bank undertook to finance a three-phased Adaptable
Program Lending (APL) instrument during 2003 – 2015 in order to improve service delivery at the
Local Authority using the Community Demand Driven (CDD) approach. The plan was for the APL
to support community efforts that contributed to the attainment of 12 out of 48 MDGs indicator
targets identified as likely to benefit from these community efforts and contribute to Malawi’s
progress towards the attainment of Human Development-related MDGs within the national
framework of MGDS. MASAF has been the main instrument for linking these central government
service delivery efforts with community priorities.

MASAF 3 APL II was designed to consolidate Community – LA linkages to complement LA-
Central Government linkages and function as a capacity building program for LAs so that they
could support and report on community efforts in their contribution to the national attainment of
MDGs hence promoting accountability and results measurement. It had strong synergies and
complemented other projects in the Bank portfolio like those in agricultural sector e.g. the
Irrigation, Rural Livelihoods and Agricultural Development Project. It supported poor farmers with
Public Works earnings to access subsidized fertilizers and maize seed.

1.3     HIGHER LEVEL OBJECTIVES TO WHICH THE PROJECT CONTRIBUTES

The Malawi Growth and Development Strategy is the overarching development strategy for
Malawi. The MASAF 3 APLII Project subscribed to two key thematic areas, namely: Social
Development and Social Protection and Disaster Risk Management.
1.4     DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN

The Development Objective of the MASAF 3 APLII Project was to improve the livelihoods of poor
households within the framework of improved Local Governance at community, Local Authority,
and National levels. Progress towards achievement of this objective was to be measured through
continuous tracking of PDO outcomes and intermediate results presented in table 5.1 below.

The MASAF 3 APLII Project was part of the IDA financing strategy using a three-phased
Adaptable Program Lending (APL) instrument (2003-2015) to improve service delivery efforts by
communities supported by Local Governments and Sector Ministries through a Community-

Driven Development (CDD) approach. Through this arrangement, the APLII was expected to
satisfy the following three triggers to get into APLIII:

           i.   LAs able to set objectives and achieve their annual targets;
          ii.   Annual PWP cycles completed according to plan;
         iii.   LAs with reporting mechanism for MDG indicator targets (number) (trigger for
                APL III).


1.5     REVISION OF PDO STATEMENT AND PDO LEVEL INDICATORS

Revision of PDO statement: During a World Bank-Government mission to the Project undertaken
in April 2010, the PDO statement was revised from the original statement: to improve the
livelihoods of poor households within the framework of improved Local Governance at
community, Local Authority, and National levels; to the current statement on which basis the
Project has been assessed: To improve the livelihoods of poor and vulnerable households and
to strengthen the capacity of local authorities to manage local development. The basis for
rewording of the PDO statement was to better reflect the direct impact areas of the Project i.e.
improvements in livelihoods and capacity of local authorities.

REVISION OF PDO LEVEL INDICATORS: At Mid Term Review it was noted that PDO-level results
indicators were only partially aligned with the PDO statement as the Key Performance Indicators
did not provide direct measurement of improved livelihoods of beneficiaries and enhanced local
government capacities. Two new indicators were introduced to replace outcome indicator number
3 “LAs able to set objectives and achieve their annual targets” and these are: (a) Number of Local
Authorities with unqualified audit reports; (b) Percent procurement of goods and services at Local
Authority level based on competitive bidding.

2.      KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

The implementation of the MASAF 3 APL II project was operating in a changing political and
economic environment. The project was affected by both internal and external factors.
2.1     EXTERNAL FACTORS

There are a number of external factors that affected project implementation. Some of the factors
that were external to the project but had an effect on project implementation are as follows;
2.1.1   Political Situation

The project was operating in an environment where there were no elected councilors to provide
political oversight at Local level. In the course of implementing this project, Malawi experienced
different political outlooks. There was a souring relationship between donors and government
leading to the suspension of development assistance to the country in 2011. The country also lost a
sitting Head of State during the period under review creating political uncertainty. However, a
smooth transition of power followed the constitutional order with the Vice President taking over as
Head of State and Government. Towards the end of the project, the country conducted tripartite
polls where amongst others, Councilors were elected bringing hope for improved local level


                                                39
governance and service delivery. It should however, be noted that changes in political
circumstances have generally not impacted negatively on the overall directions of reforms.
2.1.2   Economic Challenges

Macroeconomic imbalances started to build up after 2008 in the context of the global economic
crisis and deteriorating relations with donors. This combination of events led to fiscal and external
imbalances that required adjustment by containing domestic demand. By end-2011, Malawi was
grappling with severe fuel and foreign exchange shortages which started to choke the economy. In
early 2012, real GDP growth for 2011 was estimated to have slowed to about 4.3 percent, and the
outlook for 2012 and beyond was extremely bleak.
2.1.3 Exchange Rate Regulation

In May 2012, Government took decisive policy measures to arrest the slowdown in the economy
by implementing a comprehensive package of economic reforms. The GoM addressed the
overvaluation of the exchange rate, with one-step 50 percent exchange rate liberalization, removal
of restrictions on the setting of exchange rates by banks and foreign exchange bureaus for
transactions with their customers and removal of the requirement to surrender tobacco export
proceeds to the Reserve Bank. This allowed the transfer of the US dollars earned at the tobacco
auction floors directly to seller’s commercial banks which enable the stabilization of the forex
market.
2.1.4   Exchange Rate Movements between USD/SDR

The project lost a total of USD2, 685,224 in exchange rates due to appreciation of the US Dollar
against the SDR, the currency in which the financing was denominated. For example, under the
original financing of $50,000,000, the amount disbursed was $47,314,776 representing 100 percent
disbursement.
2.1.5   High Levels of Inflation

During the course of implementing the MASAF 3 APL II Project, Malawi experienced very high
levels of inflation. As of March 2014, inflation rate was recorded at 24 percent and reaching a record
high of 37.9 percent in March 2013. This affected the number of outputs under the project. For
example, the unit estimated cost of a teachers’ house in 2008 at project preparation was USD15,000.
This moved to USD 17,000 by July/August 2009 and in 2010, the unit estimated cost of a teachers’
house was USD22, 000 depicting an overall increase in prices of over 40 percent in a period of 2
years. This high rate of inflation caused a reduction in the number of teachers’ houses that were
constructed with the credit financing from 1,000 to 808 houses under original financing.

High inflation rates also undermine the real purchasing power of money. The wage rates for public
works programme were fixed at MK200 per participant per day for the most part of the project and
MK300 per day under the Rapid Response Public Works programme. But the high inflation rates
reduced the real basket of goods that the beneficiaries could purchase with the wages.

2.2     INTERNAL FACTORS TO THE PROJECT

2.2.1   Delays in Retirement of Imprests

Liquidation of funds for public works programme was a setback during project implementation
resulting in delays in retirement of imprests or submission of Statement of Expenditure Reports by
Councils. This has consequently, led to delayed cash transfers to about 575,000 households for the
last cycle of the 2013/2014 PWP. It is generally agreed that the introduction of the SoE financial
reporting arrangement in the middle of project implementation in October, 2012, against original
project design, was a major contributing factor to delayed retirement of the imprest amongst
councils.
2.2.2   Inadequate Capacity at Council Level

The design of the MASAF 3 APL II project was centered on, among other aspects, strengthening
the national financial management systems. The design meant that the project would use
government systems, particularly decentralized integrated financial systems for project
       implementation. Inadequate staffing capacity for financial management, internal auditors
and procurement at the district level remained weak for the most part of project implementation
causing delays.
2.2.3   Delays in Funding Flows

The delays in the funding flows were due to the extended loop before the funds reach the
communities. The funding loop was such that funds were being transferred from Credit Account at
World Bank, to LDF Designated Account at RBM, LDF Holding Account at RBM, LDF Operating
Account at Commercial Bank, NLGFC Holding Account at RBM, Local Authority Operating
Account at Commercial Bank and finally Community Bank Account at Commercial Bank. Transfer
of funds involved the following institutions LDF-TST, MOF (DAD), Accountant General, Reserve
Bank of Malawi, NLGFC, Local Authorities and The Community.
2.3     MONITORING AND EVALUATION: DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND UTILIZATION

2.3.1   Monitoring and Evaluation System Design

The MASAF 3 APLII Project Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system was designed to ensure
better planning, targeting, and feedback to relevant stakeholders and enable timely decision making
towards improving livelihoods of beneficiary household and governance at the local level. The
Project was to rely on decentralised Information Management System (MIS), the Local Authority
Management Information System (LAMIS) to capture Project outputs. The Project was also
expected to facilitate harmonisation of reporting and strengthen interface between the Project M&E
and local governments’ M&E system as a process towards improving accountability and results
management.

Social accountability tools particularly, the Community Score Card and Citizen Report Cards were
to be the main tools for generating citizen feedback on the performance of the Project, while
independent evaluators were to be used to generate evidence of Project outcomes through
Beneficiary Assessments; Tracking studies and technical audits. The Results Framework was the
main operative framework for tracking project performance towards achievement of the Project

                                                41
Development Objective and respective key performance indicators, with key information sources
including technical studies by independent consultant; an Impact Evaluation of the Public Works
programme facilitated by the Bank and internal assessments such PWP surveys implemented by
LA M&E officers and community score cards.

Instead of using the LAMIS, it was decided that the IFMIS was going to be the main Information
Management System that was going to be used for financial and physical reporting through
integration of the project management module in the IFMIS. During the Mid-Term Review, the
need for strengthening the role of LA M&E Officers in outcome porting was recognised and
subsequently integrated in the monitoring and evaluation arrangements. The Project continued to
use own Project reporting framework to satisfy the Project information requirements as harmonised
framework could not be achieved.
2.3.2   Project M&E Implementation

The Project M&E has been effective in generating credible evidence through technical studies
including: Beneficiary Assessment of the MASAF 3 APLII Project; Beneficiary Assessment of the
Crisis Response programme; Public Works Tracking Studies; Community Score Card; Performance
Assessment Measures; COMSIP Impact Evaluation; and PWP Impact Evaluation.

However, Citizen Report Cards were not able to be implemented within the Project time framework
due to the extensive requirements for setting solid ground for implementation and
institutionalisation of the CRC in the country such as training of Technical Support Team (TST)
and engaging local counter parts consultants.

The information particularly achievements under the Public Works Programme as generated
through the MIS and technical studies also provided critical inputs into the designing of a successor
Project, the MASAF 4 Project;

The Project has made substantial impacts in enhancing the skills of LA Monitoring and Evaluation
officers in tracking and reporting of outcomes which will go a long way in influencing continued
culture of results management in Las (PWP surveys undertaken by LA M&E Officers).
2.4     SAFEGUARD AND FIDUCIARY COMPLIANCE

2.4.1   Safeguards Compliance

The MASAF 3 APL II project triggered 4 Safeguards Operational Policies: OP/BP 4.01
Environmental Assessment, OP/BP 4.09 Pest Management, OP/BP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement,
and OP/BP 4.36 Forests. The implementation progress for safeguard activities continuously
improved over the course of project implementation from moderately unsatisfactory to satisfactory.
The project prepared an environmental and Social Management Framework and a Resettlement
Policy Framework to identify and mitigate any potential social and environmental impacts arising
from the project activities. The implementation of the safeguard measures followed a decentralized
approach where the local authorities and communities were responsible for social and
environmental screening, preparation of the social and environmental management plans (ESMPs),
and preparation of the Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs).


                                                 42
In the initial years of the project, implementation progress on safeguards was rated moderately
unsatisfactory owing to the fact that councils and communities were not undertaking screening of
the potential impacts. The Government moved in and recruited 27 Environmental District Officers
(EDOs) who coordinate the social and environmental activities at local authority level and serves
as secretary to the District Environmental sub Committee (DESC).
A total of 2,666 sub projects were screened for social and environmental impacts under public
works programme and a total 2,522 ESMPs were developed out of which 1,804 ESMPs were
implemented under PWP. Under the Primary School Staff Housing Programme, all the projects
were screened for social and environmental safeguards and the ESMPs were implemented. A total
of 811 Resettlement Action Plans were developed and implemented on all programs including
public works, primary school staff housing sub projects and construction of school blocks.
The LDF TST organized training to all the 27 EDOs and provided refresher courses on an annual
basis to 501 DESC members in conjunction with other projects that were funded by the World Bank
in Malawi. The councils also trained a total of 1,316 Area Executive Committee members (AECs)
who cascade the information to the grassroots. At community level, a total of 1,956 project
management committee members were trained in social and environmental safeguards. The
capacity building measures for safeguards implementation that have been developed in this
operation will be continued in the next operation.
Under the savings and investment activities that are coordinated by COMSIP, a total of 856 groups
involving 18,320 members were also trained in social and environmental safeguards screening and
preparation of the ESMPs. A total of 179 community facilitators were trained to monitor
implementation of safeguards at community level. The TST provided earmarked funding of
MK50,000 per sub project for infrastructure projects to help with implementation of mitigation
measures at community level.
The Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Management hired 27 Environmental Inspectors
and placed in various districts to join Environmental Officers who are already established in most
districts to strengthen capacity for social and environmental management and monitoring. The
Ministry also continued to provide oversight and undertake quarterly monitoring of safeguards
implementation process and local authority and community level.
2.4.2   Financial Management

The original project cost for the MASAF 3 APL II was estimated at US $50 million. In the course
of implementation there were two Additional Financing credits. The first Additional Financing was
US$ 14 million and Second Additional financing US$ 50million bringing total project estimated
cost to US$ 114 million (SDR73.4million). At the time of preparing the ICR, the disbursement rate
of the project was estimated at 87% or USD101 million of which USD99 million had been spent.
Financial Management was affected by a number of factors which included the following:
Crashing of the financial management software (sun system) after two years of project
implementation which forced the TST to operate on a manual system for over one year. Long loop
in funding flow which led to delays in funds reaching the beneficiary local authorities and the
communities. Delays in financial liquidations by the Local Authorities due to inadequate capacity
which led to delays in replenishment of the designated account. High vacancy rates in the positions
of DoF and IA at LA level


                                                43
TST and Government have moved to address most of these problems and implemented the
following remedial measures as follows: The LDF TST procured a new Financial Management
System (TOMPRO), the Bank reviewed and found it to be satisfactory which has improved
financial management and recording. The data for all previous transactions was restored in the
system. The LDF TST continued to hand hold councils that had difficulties to do financial reports
so that they may submit the reports on time. This has improved financial reporting. The LDF TST
in conjunction with the NLGFC provided refresher courses to 101 accounting personnel in the Local
Authorities and improved their capacity in financial management and reporting. Government
recruited and trained Internal Auditors and Chief Accountants that has improved financial
management and controls and quality of financial management systems at council level;
2.4.3   Procurement

Procurement at the Local Development Fund TST, Local Authority and the community levels were
undertaken in accordance with laid down procedures. Procurement procedures and contracts
administration were generally of good quality, reliable, timely and transparent. The project in
conjunction with the Office of the Director of Public Procurement trained IPC members (165
members) and provided them with procurement refresher courses on Public Procurement
procedures and processes to build their capacity in procurement. The project provided training to
Local Authorities which in turn provided training to the communities on procurements and record
management.
All reviews of the procurement function found it to be satisfactory in the course of project
implementation. The councils have been performing above average with regard to procurement.
For example, in the 2012 Local Authority assessment (LAPA) report, the average performance
under procurement was 77 percent while during the 2013 assessment; the average performance was
at 73 percent.


3.0     ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES
        Rating: Satisfactory

3.1     ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES

There is sufficient evidence to confirm that the MASAF 3 APLII Project has achieved its
Development Objective to improve the livelihoods of poor and vulnerable households and to
strengthen the capacity of local authorities to manage local development through the various
interventions implemented under the Project. Table 5.2, below presents performance on PDO level
indicator targets as of July 2014.

On specific Project results based on PDO level indictors, the performance of the MASAF 3 APLII
Project was as follows:

Improvements in Household Income: The 2012 Public Works Tracking Study indicated that 52%
of Public works beneficiary households reported to have increased household income as a result
of their participation in Public Works programme while 79% of COMSIP group members (against
the target of 49%) who were initially beneficiaries of PWP reported to have generated income
above 50% of the initial income they received from PWP. Further, the Beneficiary Assessment
(2012) reported that 74.1% of beneficiaries indicated that they would not earn more income
through any source than PWP (implying that this was an eligible group targeted by the PWP); and
that 65.3% of respondents reported to have satisfaction with income earned through community
savings groups. The First Tracking study (2011) reported that over 86% of PWP households
attributed their income to wages from PWP.


Food Security Improvements: Improvements in food security have also been reported that 62%
and 54% of PW beneficiaries (2011 and 2012 Tracking Studies respectively) used PW earnings to
meet their basic food needs compared to 31% at baseline (PWP baseline survey report, 2009); Fifty
percent (50%) of Savings and Investment group members indicated that they were no longer food
insecure. The Project made substantial contribution towards accessibility of subsidised fertiliser
(67% of PW beneficiaries directly benefited fertiliser coupons-Tracking study 2013) with 34.6%
and 30%; PW beneficiaries (2012 and 2013 Tracking studies respectively) reported to have
procured (fertiliser and maize seed) using PW earnings compared to 24.9% at baseline (PWP
baseline survey report, 2009). On the other hand, PWP households in Crisis hit areas (districts

                                                       45
affected with 2010 drought in the Southern Region) spent 40% of income on food; and 22% on
fertilizer (Beneficiary Assessment and Technical Audit of the Crisis Response Programme, 2014).
Improvements in Education Outcomes: Towards improvement of education outcomes, the 2011
Beneficiary Assessment indicated that 28.7% of beneficiary primary school teachers have moved
from temporary mad and grass thatched houses to relatively ‘permanent or better houses’. This is
likely to contribute towards improved performance of the teachers driven by satisfaction gained
through better living conditions and ultimately improvements in educational outcomes in the rural
areas. Expenditure patterns also show that a much larger proportion of PWP beneficiaries, 12.6%
and 10.6% from 2011 and 2012 Public Works Tracking Studies respectively used earnings to meet
education related expenses such as school fees and purchasing of exercise books compared to
baseline 4.4%.
The Project through the Primary School Staff Housing Project and the Crisis Response programme
have contributed to improvement in education outcomes as follows:
i.      34.1% of teachers reported to have reduced distance to school, with significant impact on
        performance of pupils;
ii.      For teachers who reported that the house conditions have significant effects on teachers
        performance (a) 62.3% of teachers indicated that they had more time to prepare for lessons
        with availability of electricity; (b) 50.7% moved from houses that leaked during the night-
        affecting their preparedness for teaching (i.e. could not rest and sleep properly during rainy
        season);
iii.     Reduced pupil to teacher ratio in rural areas due to high retention of teachers as a result of
        permanent houses;
iv.      Enhanced teacher and pupil performance in rural areas (81% of houses occupied by head
        teachers thereby strengthening supervision on other teachers, as they are resident at
        schools); 36.2% of respondents reported that pupils can learn more with increased teacher
        commitment;
v.       Ninety-nine (99%) of teachers occupying staff houses expressed satisfaction with the
        houses, which is a key motivating factor for improved performance.
vi.      Enrolment rate has increased by 31 percent and 5% in Karonga and Chitipa between 2010
        and 2013 as a result of the reconstruction of school blocks and teachers houses that were
        damaged by earthquakes
vii.      Retention rate has increased from 98.2 percent in 2010 to 99.9 percent in Chitipa in 2013
viii.    Selection to secondary schools increased from 125 students in 2010 to 271 students in 2013
ix.      School dropout declined from 0.8 percent in 2010 to 0.01 percent in 2013. In Karonga, the
        dropout rates for girls declined from 3% to 2 percent while that of boys was stable at 2
        percent.

 Contribution towards Health Sector: The Project has also made notable contribution towards the
health sector by enabling PWSP beneficiaries pay for medical bills using the PWP cash i.e. 10.6%
and 2.7% as reported in 2012 and 2013 tracking studies respectively, compared to baseline of 2.6%
at baseline (Baseline survey report, 2009).
Improvements in Capacities of Local Governments: The Project tracked two key indicators
using annual Performance Assessment Measures (PAM): (i) Number of Local Authorities with
unqualified audit reports’ and (ii) ‘Percent procurement of goods and services at Local Authority


                                                  46
level based on competitive bidding’. The 2011 PAM reported that 62% of LAs were audited. The
2013 PAM indicated that 80% of councils had evidence of records on procurements using
competitive bidding. LA’s capacity to handle large volumes of resources has been improved as
councils were able to manage large volumes of funds disbursed by the Project and effectively
delivered Public works operations as well as supporting communities in the implementation of
primary school infrastructure subprojects funded by the Project. The Annual Performance
Assessment exercise has been instrumental in promoting good practices among councils as
improvements have been noted in the key functional areas (i.e. Governance; Participatory Planning;
Financial Management; Procurement; Supervision Monitoring and Evaluation; Service delivery;
and Capacity building) that are assessed (PAM 2014).
3.2     ACHIEVEMENT OF OUTCOMES/OUTPUTS BY COMPONENT

Project implementation is rated satisfactory as the Project successfully delivered its expected
outputs.
3.2.1   Component 1: Community Livelihood Support Fund

3.2.1.1 Local Authority Fund (Public Works Programme)

Over the period of the five years the Project has been under implementation, a total of 2.2 million
beneficiaries against the target of 1,490,125 have been reached with cash transfers, with a female
representation of 50.7% achieved, and an average of 53.9% female representation achieved under
the RRP (PWP survey trend analysis report, May 2014). Through the labour intensive works under
the PWP, a total of 39,706subprojects have been implemented across the sectors, contributing
towards improvements in access to socio-economic services.
3.2.2   Community Fund

3.2.1.3 Improving Education Investments and Outcomes through the PSSHP

The Project through the Primary School Staff Housing programme jointly funded by the Bank and
Malawi Government supported construction of primary school education infrastructure with grants
disbursed to LAs amounting to US$14.4 million. The objective of the staff housing programme was
to enhance the quality of primary education through improved teacher to pupil ratio in the rural
areas by attracting more teachers to teach in rural areas. Number of primary school staff housing
constructed under the MASAF 3 programme increased from 118 staff houses 808 (MASAF 3
APL1,2008) staff houses constructed under the APLII Project. However, including government
contribution, a total of 1, 526 of 1,735 staff houses have been constructed of which 70% were fitted
with solar/connected to ESCOM grid. Of these 762 staff houses were funded by Government. The
Beneficiary Assessment (2012) of the Project reported evidence of improvements in living
conditions of the beneficiary teachers indicating that 28.7% of beneficiaries had moved from
temporary houses (grass thatched, un-burnt bricks; poles; mud structures) to relatively better
houses. The study further indicated that an enabling learning environment has been created in
intervention areas through classroom blocks constructed under the Open Menu. In addition, the
Community Score Card reported a score of 76% as excellent and very good on quality of structures
under PSSHP.



                                                47
3.2.1.4 Reconstruction of School Infrastructure in Karonga and Chitipa

A total of US$5.4 million was allocated for the reconstruction programme in Chitipa and Karonga
district councils. The reconstruction programme in Chitipa and Karonga was intended to restore
the learning environment that was damaged as a result of earthquakes in 2009 which resulted in
damage to school infrastructure in parts of Karonga and Chitipa. The Project disbursed a total of
US$4.8 million to Karonga and Chitipa district councils and enabled reconstruction of 63 staff
houses and 100 classroom blocks (200 classrooms) against the target of 66 staff houses and 122
classroom blocks (244 classrooms) in the two districts. Additionally, 10 school blocks; 21 teacher’s
houses; 1 kitchen; 1 girls’ hostel; 1 laboratory; 2 libraries; 4 office blocks; and 1 VIP latrine were
rehabilitated in Karonga district. Improvements in key education performance indicators have also
been reported (Beneficiary assessment of Crisis Response programme 2014).
3.2.1.5 Community Savings and Investment Promotion (COMSIP)

The Community Savings and Investment Component was intended to mobilize beneficiaries of
PWP into savings and investment groups as a process towards improving household residence
against shocks, as the households would eventually graduate out of dependency on safety nets. The
Project funded proposals from the “open menu” process prepared by savers mostly from Public
works programme and other community level investment. The Project disbursed a total of
US$6.1million to the COMSIP Union for implementation of the component. The Project facilitated
formation of 4,465 with 99,964 members comprising 33,712 male and 64,441 female. Evidence
shows that 79% of COMSIP group members reported to have generated income above 50% of the
initial income they received from PWP while 65.3% of respondents reported to have satisfaction
with income earned through community savings groups (Tracking studies, 2013). Also,
considerable proportion of COMSIP members (50%) reported to moved out of food insecure as a
result of their involvement in savings and investment groups.
3.2.2   Component 2: Local Authority Capacity Enhancement Fund (LACE)

The Local Authority Capacity Enhancement (LACE) component supported the development of a
comprehensive framework for addressing capacity needs of Local authorities. The main outputs
under this component are summarized as follows:
(i)    Local Development Fund Operational Frame Works that embraced LDF operational
       procedures and guidelines in form of manuals and hand books were developed shared to
       various stakeholders for use
(ii)   A comprehensive Local Authority Performance Assessment (LAPA) system in form of
       Minimum Access Conditions (MAC) and Performance Assessment Measures (PAM) was
       developed and used for three consecutive years since 2011.
(iii) Targeted capacity building programmes devised and implemented based on the outcomes
       of annual assessments.
(iv)   Various capacity building interventions were implemented and reached over 23,892
       individuals (refer Annex 2b)
(v)    590 District Executive Committee members were offered different types of training
(vi)   1,205 extension workers/frontline workers were trained in community project management
       process
(vii) 18,148 Village Development Committees were trained on their roles and village action
       planning process.

                                                 48
(viii) Performance Based Grant system developed and piloted after MTR since it was introduced
        after MTR restructuring. A total of MK52.2 million for was disbursed to councils as
        capacity building grants
(ix)    Framework for Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfer System to support service delivery of LA
        was developed by Mid-Term Review, has received Cabinet approval and will be presented
        to Parliament.
Evidence of improvements in the functionality of local governance structures and the LAs was
reported particularly under the Beneficiary Assessment study and the Community Score card. The
Beneficiary Assessment reported that team work and coordination at LA level has been enhanced
as a result of Project implementation arrangements, while at the local level, improved capacity
through training of Project Management Committees has been realized i.e. improved capacity to
manage community subprojects. In addition, trained COMSIP groups are more coherent and have
good performance in savings mobilization. Further, improved community participation has been
achieved as the decentralized committees became more effective in mobilizing their communities
in other development initiatives.
3.2.3   Component 3: National Institutional Strengthening Component

3.2.3.1 The National Institutional Component

The Project supported National Steering Committees and its subcommittee, the National Technical
Advisory Committee to assess compliance of LA subproject proposals if in conformity with various
sector norms as well as approval of financial allocations to councils. Technical Support in form of
quarterly Implementation Support Missions to LAs and issue based missions were undertaken as
part of continuous efforts towards ensuring that the Project was being implemented according to
principles and procedures.

The component facilitated project reviews through Joint Government-Donor Annual Reviews that
were undertaken in 2010 and 2011 which allowed various Cooperating Partners to review the
performance of the LDF Mechanism. This forum was an important platform for generating
feedback on the performance of the Project. The Mid-Term Review of the Project was undertaken
in 2012 during key stakeholder deliberated on Project performance and noted that the Project was
on course towards achievement of the Development Objective.

Implementation of studies was key in generating evidence on effectiveness of Project interventions
in the beneficiary communities. Major studies included: Beneficiary Assessment of the MASAF 3
APLII Project (2012); Community Score Card Process (2010); Public Works Tracking studies
(2012 and 2013); Technical Audit (2012); Beneficiary Assessment and Technical Audit of the
Crisis Response programme (2014); Impact Evaluation of the COMSIP programme (2014);
Implementation of Public Works Surveys in collaboration with LA Monitoring and Evaluation
Officers (2012-2014). These study findings were consolidated through a process of Meta-analysis
which highlighted areas of common judgements on the performance of the Project as well as
facilitating usage of the findings. Other studies were also undertaken as part of perfecting
operational systems and these included: Information System Strategy Planning (ISSP) study;
Financial Audits; Preparation of Development Communication Strategy; Development of LDF
internet and intranet; and support towards rolling out of IFIMIS Project Management module to
Local Authorities.

3.3     RELEVANCE OF THE OBJECTIVES, DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION

Rating: Highly Satisfactory
3.3.1   Relevance of Objectives

Given the high poverty incidences in rural parts of the country and unstable macro-economic
NLGFC situation in Malawi as evidenced by high inflation and interest rates and low food
production among households (up to 2 million people being food insecure according to MVAC
report 2013), the objectives of the project in all the three credits remained highly relevant. The
project was highly relevant in providing education infrastructure through construction of teachers’
houses, restoration of learning environment for up to 50,000 pupils whose schools were damaged
by earthquakes in Karonga and Chitipa and provided cash transfers to more than 2.1 million
households.
3.3.2 Relevance of Design of the Project

3.3.2.1 Deepening Decentralization

The MASAF 3 APL II project was intended to roll out the Local Development Funding mechanism.
It was intended to introduce a system of predictable and transparent grant financing mechanism and
reporting for the Local Authorities. Although there was functional decentralization, fiscal
decentralization has not fully taken place. In addition to that, throughout the project implementation
period, there were no councilors to provide political oversight at council level. However, Malawi
has conducted elections for Councilors through the 2014 tripartite elections which is expected to
improve oversight of the councils and improve financial management.
3.3.2.2 Providing Long Term Socio Protection Programs

The MASAF 3 APL II socio protection interventions were designed with a long term view, by
among others increasing the duration of the PWP from 12 days to 48 days per year and scaling up
the savings and investment activities to reach both rural areas where vulnerability seems to be
increasing, as well as urban areas where pockets of poverty are growing at a faster rate than in rural
areas. This approach remained relevant throughout the programme implementation by scaling up
public works programme and savings and investment promotion.
3.3.2.3 Provision of Financing for Community Social Infrastructure

This sub-component was expected to demonstrate ways of financing community investments in a
way that does not undermine sector performance such building schools and clinics without the
requisite recurrent funding.
3.4     JUSTIFICATION OF OVERALL OUTCOME RATINGS

Rating: Satisfactory

The achievement of PDO and the overall performance of MASAF 3 APL II is satisfactory. The
relevance of MASAF 3 APL II remained substantial throughout, as reflected in both the
Government and the Bank’s core policy and country strategy documents. MASAF 3 APL II through

                                                 50
the public works program, construction of socio infrastructure and retrofitting of education
infrastructure was the main vehicle for the delivering national safety nets, increasing incomes of
the poor and improving their household food security and consumption and improving education
outcomes at community level. The vast majority of the sub-projects portfolio is operational and
delivering benefits to the population. Economic efficiency was substantial, as MASAF’s CDD
approach delivered basic infrastructure at a lower cost than comparators and safety net parameters
follow international guidelines for cost-efficiency. The assessments of savings and investment
activities found evidence of profits and asset accumulation. The PWP beneficiaries accumulated
assets such as livestock, land and oxcarts.
3.5     OVERARCHING THEMES, OTHER OUTCOMES AND IMPACTS

3.5.1   Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects and Social Development

The PWP programme achieved its objective of increasing cash incomes and reducing food
insecurity among poor communities. The programme provided employment opportunities for both
men and women. The larger proportion of beneficiaries (60%) has been women (Beneficiary
Assessment Study Feb, 2012). A large proportion of wages (55%) received by beneficiaries was
spent on direct purchase of food and (14%) was spent on purchase of farm inputs (PWP Cash
Transfer Tracking Study, January 2012). Hence, a large proportion of the wages go into purchases
that are directly addressing the problem of food insecurity.

The PWP sub projects were integrated with the COMSIP program by creating opportunities for
community savers and entrepreneurs especially beneficiaries of PWP to increase their incomes as
well as their livelihoods. Capacity building interventions under COMSIP have facilitated the
mobilization of savings for investment which stood at MK893.8 million (U.S$2.2 million).
COMSIP members of which 62% are women (Beneficiary Assessment Study Feb, 2012) who in
Malawi are also more disadvantaged in terms of access to finance (GoM, 2012, Draft National
Gender Policy) have benefited from financial services which have been used for investment in
micro enterprises.
3.5.2   Social Development

The COMSIP Programme has assisted in bringing people, especially those from the same
geographical areas, together. During group meetings members discuss progress on achievement of
social and community development indicators focusing on areas such as housing, education and
health. Members take building better homes, accessing medical care and sending children to school
as obligations of being in a COMSIP group.
The PSSHP has contributed to retaining teachers in rural areas. Construction of Head Teachers’
houses on school premises has increased head teachers’ accessibility. (Beneficiary Assessment
Study, 2012).
3.5.3   Institutional Change/ Strengthening

Institutional strengthening intervention implemented under the project mostly aimed at supporting
institutional mechanism structures for implementing projects under the LDF. A system of assessing
Local Authorities’ performances in form of Minimum Access Conditions (MAC) and Performance
Assessment Measures (PAM) was devised to assist identification of LA capacity gaps in order to
devise better targeted capacity development programmes with the goal of improving service

                                               51
delivery in the Councils. The system has been in use for the past three years after the baseline
assessment conducted in 2010. The assessment results revealed progressive LA performance
improvement from average scores of 29 percent at baseline to 46 percent in 2013.

4.0     ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME
Overall Rating: Moderate

The risks to development outcome were cumulatively rated moderate at the close of the operation
because adequate mitigation measures were put in place at operation’s design stage and
interventions implemented during the life of the project.


5.0     ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE
5.1     BANK PERFORMANCE

Rating: Satisfactory
5.1.1   Quality at Entry

In all the cases, the projects identification, preparation and appraisal procedures were duly followed
based on systematic consultation with the Government’s Project Preparation Team. The Bank
participated in the operationalization workshop of the LDF Mechanism project which was very
critical to proper grounding of the institutional and management arrangements of the LDF at
national, district and community levels. During the operationalization workshop, a joint
Government/ Cooperating partner implementation support framework was agreed upon to help
among other things facilitate the realization of a harmonized approach to local development
financing, programming and monitoring.
5.1.2 Quality of Bank Supervision

Bank supervision is rated as ‘satisfactory ‘despite the change of Team Task Leaders three times.
The Bank managed to share Implementation Support Mission (ISM) objectives in good time. Team
composition was generally acceptable although a greater part of the time of the midterm
implementation of the project there was weak representation on the National Institutional
Strengthening component of the project. Whereas the spirit of the adaptable program lending was
to facilitate institutional development of local development financing and decentralized service
delivery, the narrower focus on safety nets should not negatively affected the already made gains
that would ensure that the LDF as a development financing and oversight agency is sustained. The
Bank may wish to follow up on this dimension in future decentralization dialogue with the
Government.
5.2     BORROWER PERFORMANCE

        Overall Rating: Satisfactory
5.2.1   Performance of Ministry of Finance

The placement of the LDF under the oversight of Ministry of Finance was strategic in term of
resource mobilization and centrality of institutional role of the LDF as a mult-sectoral programming

                                                 52
and financing instrument for local development activities and service delivery. From the onset the
Government established a Technical Support Team (TST) as a management agency to perform day-
to-day management of the fund. The Ministry of Finance was able to mobilize resources from other
donors into the LDF.
5.2.2 Performance of the LDF Technical Support Team

The Technical Support Team has performed very well and met all the management requirements
regarding the covenants agreed to between the Government and the Bank. The TST has been able
to coordinate the programming of projects from Local Authorities and disburse funding within
reasonable timescale. The TST has had tremendous impact on strengthening the capabilities of the
Local Authorities in meeting social and environmental safeguards as well as conducting tracking
surveys under the M&E function. The TST has exhibited high levels of competence and
performance standards as demonstrated by the ability to prepare additional projects in times of
crises within very short periods of time.

6.0    LESSONS LEARNED
6.1    POLICY LEVEL

The MASAF 3 APLII (LDF Mechanism) was a project specially designed to kick-start a new
intergovernmental fiscal transfer mechanism for development financing. The LDF mechanism has
demonstrated that with a devolved fiscal transfer system, development outcomes at Local Authority
level can be achieved more efficiently.
Successful achievement of policy objectives is dependent on consistent commitment from the
respective stakeholders in terms of meeting their share of obligations. The institutionalization of
fiscal devolution has not been fully implemented because government has not yet devolved the
development budget and the cooperating partners still insisting on          discreet funding and
accountability reporting.
6.2    DESIGN ISSUES

The design of the MASAF 3 Project was meant to deepen decentralization and allow councils to
plan, manage and implement activities within their priorities which are identified in consultation
with the communities. This design required that certain minimum levels of capacity in terms of
human resources, equipment and infrastructure existed at Local Authority level to support
implementation. The project has assisted to mobilize the necessary capacity to implement projects
in a decentralized manner.
IEC plays a catalytic role in mobilizing communities and other stakeholders for community
development and ensures transparency and accountability. It also assists in clarifying project
processes and procedures that contribute to the smooth implementation of the Project.
Low wages for the PWP have affected delivery of the initial intention of the project to reduce
vulnerability and provide alternative employment to vulnerable people with labour. In future, it is
imperative that the wage rate has to be responsive to the economic environment obtaining at the
time.



                                                53
6.3    INSTITUTIONAL

In order to assist communities realize their development needs, efforts such as training and technical
backstopping of the Local Authorities are vital and need to be sustained if the Local Authorities are
to take over the role of development management. Where such efforts have been sustained and the
right numbers of key staff supported, it has contributed to the successful implementation of sub-
projects and early completions.
The public works programme is working as a platform for sustainable socio networks at community
level, such as savings and investment and other groups that benefit the communities.
6.4    OPERATIONAL

Some Financial Reporting arrangements can be unsuitable for community projects. The Statement
of Expenditure (SoE) reporting arrangement for community projects has slowed down the
implementation process as the communities have challenges to adapt to the new system.
Handholding the communities to assimilate the new accounting method take time and the loop
includes the councils to account to the LDF TST before LDF TST accounts to the World Bank. In
future, the use of IFRs is advocated as a means of enhancing implementation.
Backstopping of the Local Authorities by the LDF TST and the communities by the councils
improves quality of infrastructure outputs at the local level. Capacity enhancement and
consolidation of capacities over time has shown positive outcomes. The participation of Civil
Society representatives proved vital in facilitating Community score card and should be encouraged
in future processes.
Clusters of COMSIGs are developing into Cooperatives. This is one of the most successful
components of the project with signs of self-sustenance. Due to the benefits accruing to individual
participants of the groups, mobilization among communities is self-propelling with more people
joining in order to benefit from the COMSIP activities. If groups are linked to savings and
investment, they can develop into sustainable entities.
There is a need to improve quality of community assets created through PWP. This has been a
challenge since MASAF I though the project has helped open up rural areas that were initially
inaccessible to markets and better social services. Therefore, there is need to ensure that the assets
created meet sector norms and standards. This can be improved by ensuring that adequate capacities
are available at the Local Authority to support the implementation of the projects and ensure that
standards and frameworks are also provided to guide implementation.
