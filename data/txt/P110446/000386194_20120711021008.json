objective of the Rapid\n            Response Program for Malawi is to support: (i) achieving and\n            maintaining macroeconomic stability and restoring the\n            functioning of a market-based economy to ensure a quick\n            growth rebound and (ii) protecting the poor and most\n            vulnerable groups in the short run while improving\n            transparency of delivery systems. This Rapid Response\n            Program paper seeks approval of the Executive Directors to\n            provide International Development Association (IDA) grant\n            and credit in the amount of SDR 99.6 million (US$150 million\n            equivalent) to the Republic of Malawi in support of its\n            reform program. The program responds to an urgent request by\n            the Government of Malawi (GoM) to support the ongoing\n            macroeconomic stabilization program as well as measures\n            which will mitigate the impacts of the wide range of reforms\n            which are being currently implemented. Some of the key\n            economic reforms include liberalizing Malawi's foreign\n            exchange regime and significant fuel and power price\n            adjustments to better cover costs of these essential\n            commodities. The program is aligned with the ongoing Country\n            Assistance Strategy (CAS) and is also consistent with new\n            World Bank Group CAS for Malawi (FY13-16) which is at an\n            advanced stage of preparation. This document comprises an\n            overview, which provides the context, rationale, and\n            description of the program."}, "docdt": "2012-07-05T00:00:00Z"}
