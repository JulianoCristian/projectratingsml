satisfactory outcome with moderate risk to\n            development outcome. Both the Bank and the Borrower received\n            satisfactory performance ratings. In addition to the\n            restructurings done during the approval process of the\n            additional financings, the Project had only one\n            restructuring. It was done just before project closing to\n            extend the closing date and was needed in order to apply\n            some final reallocation and adjustment of amounts among\n            components and categories. An Additional Financing (AF)\n            project reworded the PDO to make it more concise and\n            measurable without changing its substance. The revised PDO\n            was: to improve the livelihoods of poor and vulnerable\n            households and to strengthen the capacity of local\n            authorities to manage local development. The changed PDO did\n            not substantively change the objectives of the project, but\n            clarified some aspects, including areas for which the\n            project was to be held accountable. There were two AF\n            projects. The first AF aimed to (i) develop, implement, and\n            monitor a scaled-up public works-plus-savings and investment\n            program to help alleviate the poverty, social, and economic\n            impact of the crisis and (ii) provide financial assistance\n            to protect core spending on education infrastructure\n            investments through the reconstruction/retrofitting of\n            education structures damaged in the Karonga and Chitipa\n            earthquakes. The second AF was implemented as a\n            stabilization package for the project which included\n            additional support for the project, general budget support,\n            and AF for an irrigation, rural livelihoods, and\n            agricultural development project. There were several lessons\n            learned from this project including the following: (1)\n            safety net program parameters face trade-offs between cost,\n            coverage, generosity, and durability of the infrastructure\n            created and there is no right formula, (2) the focus on\n            unskilled labor, largely road maintenance and afforestation,\n            at less than market wages tended to increase women\u0092s\n            participation, (3) finally, public works will definitely\n            remain an important part of the social assistance tool kit\n            in the country. The public works program (PWP) is scalable\n            in times of crisis and can be directed to the right\n            geographic locations and target groups."}, "docdt": "2015-03-23T00:00:00Z"}
