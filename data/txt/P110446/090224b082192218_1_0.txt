                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project performance on reaching the development objective was rated satisfactory and the implementation progress rated moderately satisfactory. In relation to the relevance,
                         achievement of the development objective and efficiency, the three criteria by which the project will be assessed in the Implementation Completion Report, the current assessment is
                         as follows:



                                                                                                                                                                                                          Page 1 of 10

                         1. Relevance:
                         The relevance of the project is rated High:
                         (i) Relevance of objectives: The PDO, both in the original and reworded versions were relevant to Malawi's development priorities as it is directly related to the Africa Strategy
                         through the Pillar 2: Vulnerability and Resilience. The Project remained consistent with the Bank’s objectives in the FY2007- 2011 CAS as well as the CAS approved February 2013.

                         The project is one of the Bank's portfolio instruments that support the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MDGS II) by assisting the poor and vulnerable households, through
                         decentralized mechanisms, to improve their livelihoods, access basic social and economic infrastructure and reduce household vulnerability. Consistent with the CAS goals, the
                         original project, the first Additional Financing and the Second Additional Financing have serve the social protection needs of households which have limited access to and use of
                         specified service packages; vulnerable individuals needing assistance; and households with limited employment opportunities.

                         (ii) Relevance of the design: The design of the project was relevant as well as limited as it did not built on an earlier CDD approach which was used in previous phases of the MASAF
                         project since 1996. The design of both MASAF II and MASAF 3 APL I had inherent aspects that allowed it to be delivered through the decentralized government structure which
                         facilitated the rapid scale up of interventions to respond to the 2008-2010 financial fuel, and food crises to reach the vulnerable poor with safety nets under the labor intensive public
                         works intervention. The design also allowed the project to implement ring-fenced funds from other Bank projects with CDD aspects which led to wider reach and coverage for impact.

                         (iii) Relevance of Implementation. The project implementation remains relevant as it is through the decentralized government structure consolidating the capacity building efforts in an
                         environment where there is considerable staff attrition; it is also flexible to accommodate the scale up of the public works in times of crisis. The experience with the redesigned
                         scaled-up PWP under the Rapid Response Program made it possible to build on during the design of the MASAF 4 which is strengthening the the safety net systems in Malawi.

                         2. Achievement of the Project Development Objective:
                         The Achievement of the PDO is rated high.
                         Community Livelihood Support Fund component: The in-depth Public Works Tracking Study (2012) has generated significant evidence that the MASAF 3 APL II Project interventions
                         are having positive impacts on the beneficiary livelihoods: (i) 52 percent of Public Works beneficiaries have increased household incomes; ii) 10.9 percent of beneficiaries have been
                         able to purchase household assets using PWP cash earned; and iii) 79 percent of Community Savings and Investment group members have generated income above 50 percent of
                         the initial cash transfer they received. With regard to improvements in food security: i) use of wages to meet basic food needs declined from 62 percent to 54 percent of PW
                         beneficiaries (2011 and 2012 Tracking Studies respectively); ii) 50 percent of Savings and Investment group members indicated that they are no longer food insecure due to
                         improvements in their financial status as a result of various income generating interventions the groups have engaged in; iii) The study also showed that there has been
                         improvements in household maize production as 34.6 percent (in 2011) and 30 percent i(in 2012) PWSP beneficiaries spent their wages on farm inputs (maize seed and fertilizer);
                         and iv) 67 percent of PW beneficiaries benefited directly from the Fertilizer Subsidy Program (FISP) this demonstrates the synergy between the PW program and the FISP towards
                         improving household food security and in the country in general. It has also been observed that 12.6 percent of PW beneficiaries used the earnings for school fees and purchase of
                         other scholastic materials. For access to health facilities, 10.6 percent and 2.7 percent (2011 and 2012 tracking studies respectively) beneficiaries also used PW earnings to pay for
                         medical bills and medicines.

                         The Project has made considerable contribution towards improvements in the education and health sectors (PWP Tracer Study 2012). Through the construction of Primary School
                         Staff Houses (1, 442 staff houses) there is significant improvement of living conditions for teachers. In the intervention areas, 28.7 percent of beneficiary teachers now live in
                         relatively 'modem houses’; and 71 percent of these houses are either connected to the national grid for electricity or have solar equipment installed and are functional. This is a rare

                         privilege in the rural areas and is attracting teachers to stay in rural areas and ultimately it will contribute to improvements in education outcomes.

                         Local Authority Capacity Enhancement Fund component: Assessments for the performance on two PDO indicators show that through the Performance Assessment Measures (PAM)
                         the Project has generated evidence of better procurement practices and improvements in financial management to demonstrate Project impacts. The average score for financial
                         management has improved from 49 (2011) to 53 percent in 2012. The PAM also indicated that for procurement of goods and services at Local Authority level based on competitive
                         bidding, on average, councils scored 77 percent on adherence to key procurement requirements, meaning that they have procurement units and Internal Procurement Committees in
                         place; they have Procurement Plans and a satisfactory level of implementation; and that they adhere to procurement thresholds. 94 percent of the local councils showed evidence of
                         records on procurements using competitive bidding.

                         The DEC colleagues are conducting the PWP Impact Evaluation. The IE is still on-going, and it is expected that it will capture information that will further inform the assessment
                         towards the development objectives. Nevertheless, the general performance under the components in terms of outputs has been encouraging, with targets surpassed in most cases.

                         3. Efficiency
                         For now the efficiency is rated Substantial:
                         - The project has an ongoing technical audit study, a beneficiary assessment and a number of studies that are on-going which will inform the assessment later.
                         - Under the PWP, the ratio of the total wage bill to the total for subproject costs is at 80% meeting the international standards.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1.There is still need for joint missions by the development partners supporting the Local Development Fund as requested by the Government during the second Joint Annual Review
                         which was conducted on January 27, 2011, to reduce transaction costs in terms of time the Technical Support Team (TST) spends supporting separate missions. In March the TST
                         had to manage two separate missions by the AfDB and the World Bank.

                         2. The project is progressing towards achieving the development objective . The coverage on indicators is surpassing the set targets in most indicators, and there is 100 percent
                         disbursement under MASAF 3 APL II original Credit and 59 percent under the First Additional Financing, with the second Additional Financing registering 41 percent of the Credit
                         and 30 percent of the Grant. It is anticipated that the balance of resources under the two additional Financings will be fully utilized by June 30, 2014, the Closing Date of the Project.

                         3. Due to delays in financial reporting by the local councils, there were delays in implementing the second cycle under the Public Works Program, which does not reflect positively on
                         the performance of both the councils and the LDF-TST.
