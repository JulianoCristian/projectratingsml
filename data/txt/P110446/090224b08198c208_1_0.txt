                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has recorded visible progress towards the project objectives. Against a set target of 1,490,125 households under the Public Works Subproject Program (PWSP), a total of
                         1,016,887 beneficiaries of whom 47.5 percent are female have received wages after participating in the works. The total number of beneficiaries represents 113 per cent percent of
                         the target. About 28.7 percent of beneficiary primary school teachers live in modern houses. The PWSP has led to improved savings and investments: 13,748 beneficiaries
                         representing 40.7 percent of the total beneficiaries (of which 62 percent are female), have saved at least 50 percent (MK1,200.00) of wages earned through the PWSP. Moreover,

                         18.3 percent of PWSP beneficiaries have invested their earnings in small scale businesses, ranging from food processing, retailing of farm produce to groceries. A total of 9,562,644
                         person days of public works jobs have been created.

                         The above data confirm that beneficiaries used their wages to overcome food insecurity by spending a greater proportion of their wages on food, which was followed by purchase of

                         end of Project.


                         More time and information is needed in order to be able to ascertain the achievements at the DO level. Assessments are underway that will inform the performance on two other
                         important development objective indicators for the Local Authority Capacity Enhancement Fund component. In addition, both the Public Works Subproject Program Beneficiary Tracer
                         Study and the Impact Evaluation that are on-going, will capture information that will further inform the assessment towards the development objectives. Nevertheless, the general
                         performance under the components in terms of outputs has been encouraging, with targets surpassed in some cases.
