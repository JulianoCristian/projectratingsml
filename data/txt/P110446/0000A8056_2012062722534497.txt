                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1.       During the second Joint Annual Review which was conducted on January 27, 2011, the Government called for joint missions by cooperating partners supporting the LDF to
                         reduce transaction costs in terms of time the Technical Support Team (TST) spends supporting separate missions. This has not fully been adhered to by the development partners
                         supporting the Local Development Fund, as they continued fielding different missions.

                         2. The project is progressing towards achieving the development objective in line with the 100% disbursement under MASAF 3 APL II and 36% under the first additional financing.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
