peak demand up to 1993.\n            It will also help increase the efficiency of the water\n            distribution system in Greater Algiers.  Assistance will be\n            provided to strengthen sector planning and institutional\n            development.  The project will also assist in further\n            strengthening EPEAL's organization, accounts,\n            procedures and financial policies.  The project comprises:\n            (i) construction of two dams, pumping facilities, a water\n            treatment plant and water conveyance systems;  (ii)\n            expansion and improvement of the water distribution system\n            of Greater Algiers; and (iii) technical assistance and\n            studies.  The project will benefit about 3.5 million\n            inhabitants of Greater Algiers, of which about one-third are\n            residents of low-income districts, and will also supply\n            water for industrial and commercial development."}, "docdt": "1984-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
