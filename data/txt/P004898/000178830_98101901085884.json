 the unspecified demand and future peak demand up to 1993. It\n            will also help increase the efficiency of the water\n            distribution system in Greater Algiers. Assistance will be\n            provided to strengthen sector planning and institutional\n            development. The project will also assist in further\n            strengthening EPEAL's organization, accounts,\n            procedures and financial policies. The project comprises:\n            (i) construction of two dams, pumping facilities, a water\n            treatment plant and water conveyance systems; (ii) expansion\n            and improvement of the water distribution system of Greater\n            Algiers; and (iii) technical assistance and studies. The\n            project will benefit about 3.5 million inhabitants of\n            Greater Algiers, of which about one-third are residents of\n            low-income districts, and will also supply water for\n            industrial and commercial development."}, "docdt": "1984-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
