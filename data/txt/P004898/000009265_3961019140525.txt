MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:    Project Completion Report on Algeria
Algiers Regional Water Supply Project (Loan 2461-AL)
Attached is the Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Algeria - Algiers Regional Water
Supply project (Loan 2461-AL, approved in FY84), prepared by the Private Sector Development,
Finance, and Infrastructure Division, Maghreb and Iran Department of the Middle East and North
Africa Regional Office. The Borrower did not prepare Part II.
The project is the second in a series of four projects that were implemented under Bank
funding in the 1980s; two in Algiers and two of national scope. The main objectives were to
increase the water production capacity (two dams, transmission structures, and a treatment plant),
expand the primary distribution system, and rehabilitate the secondary network. The project also
included a technical assistance program that focused on strengthening the project executing agency,
Entreprise de Production, de Gestion et de Distribution d'Eau d'Alger (EPEAL) and supported the
establishment of the national regulating and overseeing agency, AGEP. The loan was closed in
1993, two years after schedule.
Implementation concentrated on physical components; the dams and the transmission
structures (tunnel and pipeline) were completed two years ahead of schedule, but the construction of
distribution pipelines was delayed due to slow performance of local contractors. Leak detection and
subsequent rehabilitation of the system was almost a total failure and the unaccounted-for-water still
stands at 45 percent. The project did not achieve its ambitious institutional goals. These missed
opportunities are now the specific focus of a follow-on operation (Loan 3743-AL) which was
approved in 1994.
The outcome of the project is rated as marginally satisfactory but its institutional
development impact as negligible. The sustainability of project benefits is rated as uncertain
depending on whether the deterioration of operation and maintenance can be reversed under the
follow-on operation.
The Project Completion Report is of good quality and provides a realistic picture of the
implementation of the project.
No audit is planned.                                       _

DEMOCRATIC AND POPLAR REPUBUC OF ALGERIA
ALGIERS REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
(LOAN 2461-AL)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This Project Completion Report describes the preparation, appraisal, and implementation
of the Algiers Regional Water Supply Project, for which Loan 2461-AL in the amount of
US$290 million was approved on June 28, 1984 and signed on September 26, 1984. The loan
became effective on January 25, 1985. The original closing date was December 31, 1991;
however, it was extended first to December 31, 1992 and finally to December 31, 1993 to allow
for completion of the water network renewal in central Algiers. To date, US$279.6 million have
been disbursed, leaving a balance US$10.4 in the loan account. The closing out of the loan
account is pending receipt of a refund for the special account in the amount of US$20,226.24.
Parts I and III of this report have been prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division
of the Maghreb and Iran Department, Middle East and North Africa Region. They are based
on information from the files of the ECA/MENA Information Center and a completion mission
to Algeria in May 1994. The Borrower did not submit Part II.

ALGIERS REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
(LOAN 2461-AL)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Proiect Background
1.        The population of Algiers, the nation's capital and largest city, more than tripled
between independence in 1962 and 1984 reaching 1.5 million. The expansion of the city's social
infrastructure, however, did not keep pace with this urban growth and all public services (e.g.,
water supply, sewerage, transport, telecommunications) were highly deficient in 1984. The
water supply system of Greater Algiers had remained basically the same since the early 1970s.
By the early 1980s, the city was experiencing severe water shortages, and by 1984, the
unsatisfied demand had reached 46%.
Project Objectives and Description
2.        The primary objective of the Algiers Regional Water Supply Project was to increase
water production to the level required to meet the unsatisfied demand and future demand up to
1993, which was forecast to reach 308 million m3 in that year. It would also expand and
improve water distribution in Greater Algiers and reduce the percentage of unaccounted-for
water to, at least, 25% by 1995 through the renovation of the secondary distribution network
and an extended program of leak detection and repairs. Essentially, the project supported the
construction of the Isser-Keddara Production System (SPIK), consisting of a dam and transfer
tunnel on the Boudouaou River at Keddara, another dam on the Isser River at Beni Amrane, and
a water treatment plant at Boudouaou village. The project also included: (a) installation of a
transmission pipeline to link the Keddara Dam with the water treatment plant; (b) laying of
primary distribution mains and construction of three new reservoirs and related pumping
stations; (c) supply of meters and operational equipment; (d) leak detection and repair program;
and (e) technical assistance to improve the managerial and financial capacity of the water utility
serving Greater Algiers, the Entreprise de Production, de Gestion et de Distribution d'Eau
d'Alger (EPEAL), and to support the establishment of a national agency for the regulation and
supervision of water and sewerage authorities (AGEP).
Implementation ExpeFience
3.        All major civil works for the entire SPIK were completed way ahead of schedule;
the construction of both the Keddara and Beni Amrane dams was carried out in five rather than
the seven years anticipated during project preparation and appraisal (Part m, Table 2).
Consequently, the pace of disbursements far exceeded the appraisal forecasts (Part m, Table 3).



- ii -
Procurement of civil works was carried out in a generally efficient manner and with only minor
problems. Other project components were either partially implemented or not at all. Notably,
technical assistance funds earmarked for EPEAL and AGEP were entirely unused.
Results
4.        The total project cost was US$644.1 million equivalent, compared with US$770.5
estimated at appraisal (Part III, Table 4). This 16% cost underrun was the combined result of
accelerated completion of major works, failure to implement a number of components, and cost
savings from the separate contract for works for the treatment plant (Part I, para. 5.1).
5.        The construction of two dams together with expansion of the water distribution
system measurably improved services to most of Greater Algiers. The SPIK now furnishes 105
million m3 of water p.a., which represents about half of EPEAL's total production. The
Keddara Dam and the Hamiz-Keddara transfer are functioning well. On the other hand, the Beni
Amrane Dam, treatment plant, and pumping stations face a number of persistent problems
mainly due to inadequate maintenance.
Sustainablitv
6.        Despite the increase in production and expansion of services, heavy water losses
persist. In fact, efficiency has deteriorated to the point where nearly half of the water produced
is unaccounted for (45% in 1991 and 1992). If production facilities were being properly
maintained, the aging distribution network were being rehabilitated, and an effective leak
detection and repair program were being carried out, the present production capacity would be
adequate to meet the needs of domestic, commercial, and industrial consumption through the
year 2010. But because no progress has been made toward carrying out these activities during
the last ten years, it unlikely that the benefits of the project will be sustained.
Conclusions and Lessons Learned
7.        The project was a success from the standpoint of physical works implementation.
Major civil works were completed in 1987, and some 90% of loan proceeds were disbursed.
However, disbursement of the remaining funds, mainly for works awarded to local enterprises,
was spread out over the next six years. If the performance of these enterprises had not been so
weak, the Bank loan could have been fully disbursed and the loan account closed by the original
closing date of December 31, 1991.
8.        However, the project clearly failed to develop an efficient water distrbution
network, as evidenced by the volumes of water being lost. This failure can be attributed mainly
to the project's having been implemented in an environment characterized by weak institutional
linkages and a bias against investment in maintenance and external assistance at a time of rapid
urban growth and network expansion. Despite the availability of technical assistance funds,
EPEAL's management improvement program never got off the ground. Moreover, efforts to
detect and repair leaks in the network were ineffective. On the other hand, the continued direct



- iii -
association between the Bank and the water company under two loans, together with less direct
association through subsequent loans, has enhanced the company's standing, strengthened its
managerial and financial autonomy, and encouraged it to carry out appropriate financial policies.
At the same time, Bank supervision missions were less forceful in convincing authorities at the
ministerial and enterprise levels that carrying out maintenance, as well as leak detection and
repair, programs was no less important than investing in new water works.
9.        The new Water Supply and Sewerage Rehabilitation Project (Loan 3743-AL) will
provide EPEAL with another opportunity to operate and maintain an efficient water supply
system. Moreover, in the context of this project, efforts are already underway to restructure
sector institutions, introduce a system of incentives, and pave the way for the eventual
privatization of services. This new context should assist EPEAL management in rehabilitating
the needed 200-300 km p.a. of its 1,775-km distribution network and in carrying out a leak
detection and repair program with a view to reducing unaccounted-for water to an acceptable
level. EPEAL's successful participation would surely enhance the sustainability of the SPIK.

Subsector            : Urban Water Supply
2. Project Background
2.1       Water Resources. Water resources in Algeria are generally limited and difficult
to exploit. Most of the surface water sources are dry in summer, are of poor quality, and thus
cannot readily be used for domestic and industrial supply. In general, regulation of the rivers
through costly reservoirs is required in order to ensure economically exploitable yields. On the
other hand, the rate of infiltration from storm runoff and surface sources is high and as a result,
groundwater is available in most of the country and represents more than two-thirds of the
available water resources. The salinity of a large portion of the groundwater, however, is high,
restraining its use for domestic consumption and irrigation. Most urban areas are presently
supplied with groundwater.
2.2       Water Supply Services. Since independence in 1962, there has been an explosion
of its urban population, which until recent years was growing at 3.5% p.a. This was
particularly acute in Algiers, the nation's capital and largest city, whose population has more
than tripled between 1962 and 1984 reaching 1.5 million. The expansion of the city's social
infrastructure did not keep pace with this urban growth and all public services (e.g., water
supply, sewerage, transport, telecommunications) were highly deficient. The water supply
system of Greater Algiers had remained basically the same since the early 1970s. By the early



- 2 -
1980s, the city was experiencing severe water shortages, and by 1984, the unsatisfied demand
had reached 46%.
2.3       Institutional Framework.  The water and sewerage sector organization has
undergone substantial reorganization over the past 20 years. In 1970, the National Potable and
Industrial Water Distribution Company (Societe Nationale de Distribution d'Eau Potable et
Industrielle - SONADE) was established to ensure adequate water production and distribution
to meet the needs of the main urban centers (Algiers, Oran, Constantine, Annaba, Setif).
Investments were generally financed by Government grants, tariffs were low, and service and
maintenance levels poor. In the late 1970s, the Government changed its strategy placing greater
emphasis on water resources development and on improving basic infrastructure.  A
reorganization of the sector began in 1980 and culminated in the establishment of 13 regional
public utility companies. In 1987, four regional water utilities were disbanded, the remaining
nine reduced in size, and 26 wilaya companies formed, giving the sector a total of 35
companies.
2.4      Bank Involvement in the Sector. The Bank has granted six loans to Algeria for
water supply and sewerage, including an engineering loan (Part m, Table 1). The Bank first
became involved in the sector in 1978 when it granted a loan in the amount of US$82 million
for the Algiers Sewerage Project (Loan 1545-AL) to finance the construction of sewer
interceptors and a sewage treatment plant in Greater Algiers, as well as management and
engineering studies in the cities of Algiers, Constantine, and Oran. The project also financed
a study of the organization, management, tariffs, and financial structure of the Algiers Water
Company (SEDAL). The study was completed in 1981. The Entreprise de Production, de
Gestion et de Distibution d'Eau d'Alger (EPEAL), the new water utility that succeeded SEDAL,
has been implementing the new organization since 1982 entirely on its own. The Algiers
Sewerage Project was followed by the Algiers Regional Water Supply Project and two projects
of national scope, which are still ongoing and finance the expansion of water supply and
sewerage in the country's other large cities (i.e., Oran and Constantine) as well as in medium-
size cities. Through all four project loans, an attempt has been made to strengthen sector
institutions. Although not always successful, Bank intervention has nevertheless led to major
institutional and policy reforms, such as the Government's decision to redefine its relationship
with the country's water utilities granting them greater autonomy and to establish regional tariffs
by 1997 to better approximate the average long-run marginal cost of water in each hydrographic
region.
2.5      The Bank has recently adopted an integrated approach to water resource management
and development. This new approach has been well documented by the Middle East and North
Africa Regional Office,2 the Maghreb and Iran Department,3 as well as through a joint effort
21       The World Bank: "A Strategy for Managing Water in the Middle East and
North Africa," September 20, 1993.

Paper," Green Cover, January 28, 1993.

between that Department and the Environment Division of the Technical Department. 4 Recent
revisions to the lending program reflect an emerging, streamlined portfolio highly focussed on
environmentally sustainable water resource development to meet the needs of human, industrial,
and agricultural consumption. Assistance priorities for integrated water resource management
and development will consist of infrastructure rehabilitation, private sector development, natural
resource management, rational water pricing, and environmental protection. Institution building
will be geared toward establishing autonomous, financially viable institutions with a more solid
base for cost recovery. Effective demand management will promote conservation.
2.6      The present dialogue on water resources for urban water supply between the Bank
and the Government of Algeria centers on the startup of the sixth project, Water Supply and
Sewerage Rehabilitation, in June 1994. This project supports the rationalization of institutional
arrangements in the urban water sector with a view to achieving full cost recovery by
autonomous, self-financing utilities. Another key feature of the project is a comprehensive,
nationwide rehabilitation program. In addition to replacing aging distribution networks, this
program will cover leak detection and repair, setting up of a reliable metering system,
establishment of efficient billing and collection procedures, and updated census of water
customers.
3. Project Objectves and Description
3.1      Project Objectives. The objectives of the Algiers Regional Water Supply Project
were to: (a) increase water production to the level required to meet the unsatisfied demand and
fdture demand up to 1993, which had been forecast to reach 308 million m3 in that year; (b)
expand and improve water distribution in Greater Algiers; and (c) reduce the percentage of
unaccounted-for water to not more than 25% by 1995 through the renovation of the secondary
distribution network and an extended program of leak detection and repairs.
3.2      Project Description.
Part I
(a)   construction of an impounding dam on the Oued Boudouaou (Keddara Dam) with an
annual capacity of 145 million ml and a tunnel to transfer excess water of the Hamiz

Part HI
(c)   construction of a diversion dam on the Oued Isser at Beni Amrane, pumping facilities
and a conveyance main (including two tunnels) to transfer water to the Keddara
Reservoir;
(d)  laying of a transmission pipeline between the Keddara Reservoir and the Boudouaou
Treatment Plant;
(e)  installation of a transmission pipeline to convey treated water to Greater Algiers;
(f)  laying of two primary distribution mains, and construction three new reservoirs and
related pumping stations;
(g)   supply of master and domestic water meters and operational equipment for EPEAL;
(h)  leak detection and repair program;
(i)  technical assistance to EPEAL in reviewing and implementing its organizational
structure and management and financial procedures; and
(j)  technical assistance to the Ministry of Hydraulics, Environment, and Forests (MHEF)
in carrying out a sector survey and establishing a national agency for the regulation
and supervision of the regional water supply and sewerage authorities (i.e., AGEP).
4. Project Design and Organization
4.1      A Bank loan of US$5 miflion was made in 1980 to finance technical assistance for
the preparation of the Algiers Water Supply Project. This assistance led to the formulation of
a master plan for the development of water resources in the Algiers-Sebaou region. The Bank
reviewed the feasibility study of the master plan, which became the basis for project appraisal.
In 1981, however, further processing of a loan for the project was stopped, awaiting the
Government's approval of a tariff increase for Greater Algiers. Meanwhile, the contract for
the construction of the Keddara dam was awarded after ICB and in consultation with the Bank,
and civil works proceeded as scheduled.
4.2      The project was appraised in March 1984 and the loan negotiated in May of that year.
Under agreed implementation arrangements, the General Directorate of Hydraulic Infrastructure
within MHEF (having since then been reorganized into the Ministry of Equipment) would
supervise the construction of the Keddara Dam, the Hamiz-Keddara Tunnel, and the other civil
works with consultant assistance. The General Operations Directorate (DGE) within the
Ministry would operate and maintain the Keddara Dam, Hamiz-Keddara Tunnel, and the Beni
Amrane Dam for EPEAL, and EPEAL would pay DGE for its services. In 1986, the National
Potable and Industrial Water and Sanitation Agency (Agence Nationale de l'Eau Potable et



Industrielle et de I'Assainissement - AGEP) was established with the Ministry to coordinate
regional water company operations. AGEP's role would be to assist the Ministry in planning
and implementing water supply and sewerage investment programs, recommending nationwide
tariffs for approval by the Government, identifying the required level of Government
contributions to the companies to optimize the use of financial resources in the sector, and
formulating detailed sector policies. EPEAL would be in charge of metering, leak detection,
and repair programs.
5. Implementation Experience
5.1      All major civil works for the entire Isser-Keddara Production System (SPIK) were
completed way ahead of schedule; the construction of both the Keddara and Beni Amrane dams
was carried out in five rather than the seven years anticipated during project preparation and
appraisal (Part m, Table 2). Consequently, disbursements far exceeded the appraisal forecasts
(Part m, Table 3). Procurement was carried out in a generally efficient manner and with only
minor problems. By 1984, about one-third of the Keddara Dam construction was completed and
international contractors for the remaining works had been prequalified. The Government
decided to group the Beni Amrane Dam, Boudouaou treatment station, pipelines, and related
equipment into seven items, to allow contractors to submit bids on all seven items, or separate
bids on the treatment station and the remaining six items. A package consisting of six of these
items was awarded to a foreign consortium, which included the contractor for the Keddara Dam.
The last item consisted of the design, equipment supply, and civil works for the Boudouaou
water treatment plant. An in-depth analysis of the bids by the Algerians revealed that if the
scope of this contract were limited to the design of the facility and supply of equipment, the
related civil works could be awarded separately leaving open the option to increase (up to 20%)
the quantity ordered under the earlier contract with the firm awarded the six other items. This
proposal, which was judged to be consistent with Bank guidelines, resulted in a savings of about
US$10.1 million.
5.2      Three years after the Beni Amrane Dam became operational, it was discovered that
high volumes of clear water could not be pumped to Keddara because it was taking a week for
the water to settle. In September 1991, Algerian authorities requested agreement from the Bank
to finance a second water intake at the Beni Amrane Dam. Following a request granted by the
Bank, the contractor that had built the dam installed an additional intake, which improved the
performance of the Beni Amrane transfer.
5.3      Although the project provided for 1,350 staff-months of expert services, the technical
assistance component, which was intended for AGEP and EPEAL, was not implemented under
this project. The strengthening of AGEP was deferred to the National Water Supply and
Sewerage Project (Loan 2821-AL), as was the sector survey carried out by AGEP. Further
institutional assistance to restructure AGEP will be provided under the new Water Supply and
Sewerage Rehabilitation Project (Loan 3743-AL).



- 6 -
5.4      EPEAL's management improvement program never got off the ground. In 1986,
EPEAL placed a pre-qualification notice in a local newspaper inviting internationally known
management firms to submit proposals. But EPEAL did not follow through. Instead, it sought
a credit through French bilateral assistance to carry out the program and requested cancellation
of this portion of the Bank loan. EPEAL later decided to use Bank funds rather than bilateral
aid for that purpose and withdrew the cancellation request, but it never recruited management
consultants.
6. Results
6.1      Project Costs. 'he total project cost was US$644.1 million equivalent, I compared
with US$770.5 estimated at appraisal (Part m, Table 4). This 16% cost underrun was the
combined result of accelerated completion of major works, failure to implement a number of
components, and cost savings from the separate contract for works for the treatment plant
procurement (Part I, para. 5.1).
6.2      Functioning of the Installations. The construction of two dams together with
expansion of the water distribution system measurably improved services to most of Greater
Algiers. The SPIK now furnishes 105 million m3 of water p.a., which represents 48% of
EPEAL's total production. The Keddara Dam and the Hamiz-Keddara transfer, under the
management of the National Dam Agency (ANB), are functioning well. The only problems lie
in the lack of water resources due to the recent drought. Earlier problems protecting resources
from pollution (domestic pollution, proximity to gas pipelines) have been resolved. On the other
hand, the installations under the management of EPEAL, the Beni Amrane Dam and pumping
and treatment facilities, suffer from a number of persistent problems. Maintenance is inadequate
due to the lack of qualified staff, maintenance equipment, and spare parts, especially for the
pumping and treatment facilities. Protection of the holding basin is also inadequate due to
difficult access and a nearby construction site. Efforts to install new meters and renewal of old
ones throughout the network have been ineffective; only 70% of EPEAL's customers have
individual meters. The leak detection and repair program fell short its targets as unaccounted-for
water remained at around 45% of the quantity produced instead of 25-30%, which would have
been within acceptable limits.
6.3      Institutional Strengthenine of EPEAL. Terms of reference were approved for
EPEAL's management improvement program, which was never carried out. Nevertheless,
EPEAL indirectly benefitted from the continuous policy dialogue between the Bank and the
Algerian authorities surrounding the design, preparation, and implementation of three follow-on
national water supply and sewerage projects (Loans 2591, 2821, and 3743-AL). It directly
benefitted from the training component of the Algiers Sewerage Project (Loan 1525-AL). As
a result, EPEAL doubled the productivity of its staff in terms of number of employees per 1,000
2./ derived on the basis of actual disbursements.



connections, from 16 in 1984 to 8 by 1993, while evolving from a municipal division into a
semi-autonomous public enterprise (EPIC).
6.4      Institutional Strengthening of AGEP. Project-supported technical assistance
objectives designed to assist the Ministry in creating AGEP were only pardally met. When
AGEP was founded in 1986, it was charged with formulating sector policy for urban water
supply and overseeing sector operations, as well as providing water utilities and municipal
sewerage services with technical assistance and training. Unfortunately, AGEP had to be
released from those responsibilities so that it could urgently fill a technical void and devote
nearly all its resources to planning and supervising the construction of water works. Under the
Second National Water Supply and Sewerage Project (Loan 2821-AL), AGEP did manage,
however, to undertake a major organizational study, with consultant assistance, to determine the
actions to be taken, as well as the structures and procedures to be put in place, in order to
improve efficiency throughout the sector. With support from the Bank under the new Water
Supply and Sewerage Rehabilitation Project (Loan 3743-AL), AGEP will be restructured into
an autonomous, self-financing entity capable of providing the water utilities with technical
assistance to improve their commercial and financial activities.
6.5      Flnancial Performance. The Algiers Sewerage Project (1524-AL) included a water
tariff study, which was completed in 1981. But not until 1984 did the Government approve a
41 % tariff increase, which would enable EPEAL to finance at least 50% of its investments. The
tariff increase together with notable progress made by EPEAL in strengthening its organization
and procedures assuaged the Bank's concern over the Government's commitment to the Algiers
Regional Water Supply Project. Even though this represented a significant increase, the project
would nearly triple EPEAL's gross fixed assets resulting in a high debt service in the medium
term. Incremental increases in the company's ability to finance these new investments through
internal cash generation would underpin its financial performance objectives during project
implementation.
6.6      Comparison of financial projections with EPEAL's actual statements from 1984 to
1993 (Part III, Table 5) shows major variations due to: (a) much higher local inflation than
expected; (b) limited capacity to take over and manage an aging distribution network; (c)
inadequate commercial management; and (d) inappropriate financial reporting procedures and
accounting systems, which fail to take into account the transfer of assets and corresponding
medium- and long-term debt. Local inflation had been originaUy estimated at 7% between 1984
and 1988, 6% in 1989 and 1990, and 5% in 1991 and thereafter. But in reality, it increased
progressively, over the years, reaching 24% in 1992. As result of spiraling inflation and the
failure to reduce unaccounted-for water, operating costs rose at a considerably higher rate than
revenues from water sales. Before 1992, periodic tariff increases were insufficient to offset that
deficit. In 1992 and 1993, EPEAL's operating ratio dropped below "1." However, this positive
indicator must viewed with caution since the annual depreciation expense does not reflect
renewal of the assets managed and operated by the company or the interest on the corresponding
medium- and long-term debt. In contravention of the Loan Agreement signed between the
Algerian Government and the Bank, as well as the subsidiary loan agreement signed the
Government and EPEAL, the SPIK assets were not transferred to EPEAL's balance sheet (Part



IH, Table 7). In the meantime, however, the Government, backed by the Bank, has changed
its approach to the ownership and financing of water production and distribution systems. Under
the Water Supply and Sewerage Rehabilitation Project (Loan 3743-AL), it has been agreed that
the Government will retain ownership of the infrastructure and lease these assets to the utility
companies for a fee.
6.7      Economic Justification. The recalculated economic rate of return (ERR) using
current tariffs and 1994 prices for investment and operating costs is 10% (Part mII, Table 7),
compared with 8% at appraisal. Higher economic performance is due to an earlier completion
date for major civil works, as well as considerably fewer staff per 1,000 connections resulting
in low incremental operating costs. Regardless of the ERR, the overriding justification for the
project was the need to provide Greater Algiers with a sufficient supply of safe drinking water
and adequate services. The project was the least-cost solution to provide such supply. It would
generate enormous health and environmental benefits that cannot be measured in quantifiable
values. These include reduced expenses for health care, reduced time spent by women and
children collecting water, higher productivity of children in school, as well as higher worker
productivity as a result of better health.
6.8      Enviromental Inpact. Neither the implementation nor the subsequent operation
of the SPIK has had a negative impact on the environment. On the contrary, the availability of
potable water has contributed to the well-being of the population. Notwithstanding this important
contribution, the project could have had a greater impact if EPEAL's leak detection and repair
program had succeeded. When the project was launched, large volumes of water distributed
from an old network were being lost due to leaks in the system. By stopping those leaks, the
project would have eliminated water pools, ideal breeding places germ-carrying vectors.
7. Sustainability
6.       Despite the increase in production and expansion of services, heavy water losses
persist. In fact, efficiency has deteriorated to the point where nearly half of the water produced
is unaccounted for (45% in 1991 and 1992). If production facilities were being properly
maintained, the aging distribution network were being rehabilitated, and an effective leak
detection and repair program were being carried out, the present production capacity would be
adequate to meet the needs of domestic, commercial, and industrial consumption through the
year 2010. But because no progress has been made toward carrying out these activities during
the last ten years, it unlikely that the benefits of the project will be sustained.
8. Bank's Performance
8.1      The Bank's role in the sector has been to assist the Government in strengthening its
project planning and implementation capacity and in establishing a strong institutional
framework, with support for sector policy formulation. Since the first Bank loan to the sector
in 1978, a major objective has been to strengthen sector institutions. This objective has been



- 9 -
pursued on two fronts. In the first place, the Bank has advocated improved policies dealing with
tariffs, water conservation, and water rights. The first water tariff increase since the country's
independence was approved on the occasion of the first Bank-financed project. Other tariff
increases have followed, with the two most recent being a doubling of the current tariff in 1993
and 33 % in 1994. Together with a change in policies, we have pursued the reform of the sector
organization. With the first loan, we advocated the creation of regional water utilities. The first
one was set up in Greater Algiers. The continued direct association between the Bank and
EPEAL under a second loan (i.e., Algiers Regional Water Supply Project) has enhanced its
standing, strengthened its autonomy, and encouraged it to carry out appropriate financial
policies.
9. Borrower's Performance
9.1      The Algerian  authorities demonstrated  their commitment to the physical
implementation of the project by entering into a contract for construction of the Keddara Dam
and starting civil works more than two years prior to the approval of the loan. ANB
competently supervised construction of that component and later AGEP site engineers
competently supervised the Beni Amrane Dam and related works. Unfortunately, however, there
was no systematic reporting between ANB and AGEP, the latter of which had overall project
management responsibility. In addition, there were long delays in making payments to
contractors. In October 1985, for example, arrears of up to six months in payments owed to
contractors mounted to US$47 million equivalent. Moreover, during the project period, progress
in institution building was extremely slow. The eventual commitment to reforming the sector,
nevertheless, became manifest and culminated in the signing of an acceptable Letter of Sector
Policy Development by the Minister of Equipment, as a prerequisite to the presentation of the
latest project to the Bank's Board of Directors in May 1994.
10. Consultants' Performance
10.      The consultants who supervised civil works carried out their tasks
in a fully satisfactory manner.
11. Project Documentation and Data
11.1     The amalgam of information contained in the Staff Appraisal Reports, Loan and
Project Agreements, correspondence files, audit reports, and computerized disbursement data
were adequate. However, preparation of this report entailed somewhat excessive cross-
referencing of materials because essential background or detailed information was excluded from
some documents.



- 10-
12. Conclusions and Lessons Leamed
12.01    The project was a success from the standpoint of physical works implementation.
Major civil works were completed in 1987, and some 90% of loan proceeds were disbursed.
However, disbursement of the remaining funds, mainly for works awarded to local enterprises,
was spread out over the next six years. If the performance of these enterprises had not been so
weak, the Eank loan could have been fully disbursed and the loan account closed by the original
closing date of December 31, 1991.
12.02.   However, the project clearly failed to develop an efficient water distribution network,
as evidenced by the volumes of water being lost. This failure can be attributed mainly to the
project's having been implemented in an environment characterized by weak institutional
linkages and a bias against investment in maintenance and external assistance at a time of rapid
urban growth and network expansion. Despite the availability of technical assistance funds,
EPEAL's management improvement program never got off the ground. Moreover, efforts to
detect and repair leaks in the network were ineffective. On the other hand, the continued direct
association between the Bank and the water company under two loans, together with less direct
association through subsequent loans, has enhanced the company's standing, strengthened its
managerial and financial autonomy, and encouraged it to carry out appropriate financial policies.
At the same time, Bank supervision missions were less forceful in convincing authorities at the
ministerial and enterprise levels that carrying out maintenance, as well as leak detection and
repair, programs was no less important than investing in new water works.
12.03    The new Water Supply and Sewerage Rehabilitation Project (Loan 3743-AL) will
provide EPEAL with another opportunity to operate and maintain an efficient water supply
system. Moreover, in the context of this project, efforts are already underway to restructure
sector institutions, introduce a system of incentives, and pave the way for the eventual
privatization of services. This new context should assist EPEAL management in rehabilitating
the needed 200-300 kn p.a. of its 1,775-km distribution network and in carrying out a leak
detection and repair program with a view to reducing unaccounted-for water to an acceptable
level. EPEAL's successful participation would surely enhance the sustainability of the SPIK.
