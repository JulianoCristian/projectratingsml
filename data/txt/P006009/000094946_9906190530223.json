Sustainability is likely for most activities.\n            The project helped create an improved business environment\n            in the agricultural sector, eliminated foot-and-mouth\n            Disease and Citrus Canker, and supported Government's\n            restructuring of the public sector. However, in the area of\n            institutional strengthening, project financed activities\n            were neither sustainable nor cost-effective. Key lessons\n            learned include: a) thorough sector assessment permitted\n            identification of key bottlenecks, addressed by public\n            sector initiatives; b) organization of plant and animal\n            health campaigns were the most effective\n            government-sponsored activities to open new export markets;\n            c) organized producer involvement from the outset permitted\n            Government to pass-on operational responsibility to the\n            private sector; d) in the absence of institutional capacity,\n            project outputs were unable to effectively support\n            development objectives; e) institutional strengthening\n            activities should have been carried out directly with\n            implementing agency staff, not project consultants, and\n            required specific monitoring and evaluation indicators; and\n            f) external implementation support should have been\n            centralized in the project coordination unit, with\n            assistance to implementing agencies provided within the\n            context of their line operations under their direct responsibility."}, "docdt": "1999-05-19T00:00:00Z"}
