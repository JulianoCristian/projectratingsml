and high value-added agricultural,\n            horticultural, livestock, forestry and fisheries products.\n            The project will strengthen agricultural services through\n            investment in physical facilities, institutional\n            development, training and technical assistance activites.\n            Specifically the project will: (a) strengthen animal disease\n            control through construction of a reference laboratory, a\n            quarantine station and promotion of intensive vaccination\n            programs; (b) strengthen phytosanitary programs to create\n            and maintain plant disease- and insect pest- free zones; (c)\n            improve wool grading and classification to improve market\n            transparency; (d) strengthen analysis and monitoring of\n            maximum sustainable fish catches; (e) promote export of\n            higher value-added meat products; (f) improve research on\n            wool, biotechnology, post-harvest physiology of fruits and\n            vegetables, and forest plantation management; (g) provide\n            specialized training and technical assistance to strengthen\n            technical and marketing skills in the Meat Board and\n            Fisheries Institute; and (h) assist the private sector to\n            venture into new export markets by partially financing\n            marketing studies, technical assistance, and overseas visits\n            and export promotions."}, "docdt": "1991-01-29T00:00:00Z"}
