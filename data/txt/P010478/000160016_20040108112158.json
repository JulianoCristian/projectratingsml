The main lessons learned\n            are: The decentralized, participation-based approach to\n            provision of infrastructures has proven to be successful and\n            is replicable. For replication to happen, considerable\n            institutional capacity in the provincial government, and\n            lower level of governments are required to implement a large\n            decentralized program of this type. Community development\n            and empowerment is an essential prerequisite for project\n            investments in local communities and became the basis for\n            the new decentralization policies of the Government. It is\n            clear that the project's model can support the\n            devolution process, but this would need considerable effort\n            to build up the capability of the weak and newly devolved\n            local governments in partnership with their\n            communities--with the help of other partners, service\n            organizations such as the nongovernmental organizations, the\n            private sector, established government, and private training\n            institutions. The report contains other lessons highlighted\n            from the experience of the project:  Development of adequate\n            human and institutional capacity is essential at all levels\n            and this was initially a problem in the project. Strong\n            commitment should be ensured from the Government and\n            implementation agencies in terms of minimizing the\n            bureaucratic delays (speedy approval), presence of project\n            staff for the project duration, and flexibility toward the\n            socially oriented development. Innovative, community-based\n            projects must respond flexibly and adapt to the varying\n            demands generated during the community mobilization process.\n            Sufficient time needs to be allowed for awareness building\n            and community development before planning investments.\n            Ensure that procurement capacity of the implementing agency\n            is properly assessed during project preparation, take steps\n            in the project design to strengthen it and that Bank\n            procurement guidelines are fully understood by the Borrower.\n            Ensure inclusion of a sound financial management system in\n            the project design. Post implementation monitoring needs to\n            be sustained which could help in resource allocation for the\n            maintenance of physical and social infrastructure."}, "docdt": "2003-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
