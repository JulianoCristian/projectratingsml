Helping Children Lead Healthier Lives in Bolivia                                                           July 1, 2002
                       In 1999 confronted by some of the most bleak health indicators in Latin America, the Bolivian
                       government asked the World Bank to help it with a program to bring better health care to poor families
                       throughout the country.

                       The World Bank responded by approving a $25 million Health Sector Reform Program that had as its
                       priority reducing high maternal and infant mortality rates.

                      Adopting a results-based approach centered on yearly targets for eight basic health indicators, the
project quickly made immunization more widely available and helped the poor gain better access to health care services. 
Coordination between Bolivian officials and donor agencies improved, resulting in more effectively targeted health care
delivery.

Immunization coverage jumped to 86 percent in 2000 from 75 percent in 1998, with government spending on vaccines
soaring to $3 million in 2000 from $500,000 in 1999.  At the same time, the number of births attended by trained health
workers climbed to 51 percent from 36 percent, and the number of children treated for pneumonia increased by 65 percent.

In response to these results, the World Bank in June 2001 approved $35 million for the project’s second phase.  This second
phase of the initiative has as its overall goal a reduction of infant mortality to no more than 48 for every 1,000 babies born by
2008, versus 67 for each 1,000 in 1998. The program also will expand health coverage to an additional 25 percent of the
population, or about 2 million people, by assigning new health teams supported by indigenous community agents to the
poorest regions of the country.
