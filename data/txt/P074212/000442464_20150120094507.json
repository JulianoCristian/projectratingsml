The World Bank responded by approving a 25 million\n            health sector reform program that had as its priority\n            reducing high maternal and infant mortality rates. Adopting\n            a results-based approach centered on yearly targets for\n            eight basic health indicators, the project quickly made\n            immunization more widely available and helped the poor gain\n            better access to health care services. In response to these\n            results, the World Bank in June 2001 approved 35 million\n            dollars for the project\u0092s second phase. This second phase of\n            the initiative has as its overall goal a reduction of infant\n            mortality to no more than 48 for every 1,000 babies born by\n            2008, versus 67 for each 1,000 in 1998."}, "docdt": "2002-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
