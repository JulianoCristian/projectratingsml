        Health Sector Reform Project for Bolivia were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the use of a\n            project executing unit not fully integrated to the Ministry\n            of Health's core organizational configuration may\n            undermine its active involvement in project implementation\n            activities. Based on the experience gained during the first\n            phase, project design made an attempt to move the\n            implementation unit closer to the ministry's mainstream\n            activities. This lukewarm effort did not yield meaningful\n            results. On the contrary, most senior staff from the\n            Ministry resented the existence of this special unit with\n            higher salaries and easy access to the Minister. Performance\n            Agreements became a very useful tool to consolidate a\n            results-oriented culture. This was a powerful tool\n            introduced by the Health Reform Program that has had a\n            positive impact for managing decentralized health programs.\n            One key feature was the use of a limited number of clearly\n            defined indicators with realistic targets that helped to\n            keep programs well-focused. Close monitoring using a\n            consistent methodology enabled corrective actions to be\n            taken in a timely manner. The use of revolving funds to\n            manage the transfer of financial resources also proved a\n            very useful tool. It is crucial to address cultural barriers\n            created by ethnic diversity to further improve health\n            indicators in Bolivia. Cultural diversity remains the\n            greatest challenge for improved maternal and child health of\n            the poor in Bolivia. The program began to bridge the\n            cultural barrier with the use of specially tailored\n            activities, but they need to be developed in greater depth\n            to accommodate cultural factors. Coverage of prenatal\n            controls and births attended by trained health personnel\n            stagnated during the project period and cultural barriers\n            has been mentioned as one of the critical factors to making\n            further progress."}, "docdt": "2009-01-27T00:00:00Z"}
