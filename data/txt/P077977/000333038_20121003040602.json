for\n            India were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk\n            to development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: there was wide variation in the capacity of states\n            to implement the program effectively. The design for similar\n            projects should build in some flexibility in the level of\n            support required by different states in order to tailor the\n            technical assistance program to the needs of each state. To\n            support the development of capacity at state level, there is\n            a need to institutionalize training activities within\n            existing national and state institutions like state\n            technical agencies and other academic institutions engaged\n            in PMGSY (Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana).  Another\n            important lesson relates to ensuring that maintenance of the\n            road network is done in a regular and sustainable way, which\n            in turn requires that reform in maintenance be carried out\n            in an incremental and steady manner. The project though well\n            designed for community participation for the 'project\n            planning' cycle through tools such as information\n            dissemination; transect walk; collaboration for\n            participatory mapping of the impacts; etc. had limited\n            design for 'community participation and\n            supervision' during the stage of construction. To\n            achieve comprehensive community participation, social\n            accountability systems through models such as Community\n            Score Cards, Social Audit, etc. may be implemented.\n            Extension of Rural Development Program to the adversely\n            affected. There are currently no provisions in other rural\n            development programs for preferential treatment of people\n            affected by PMGSY. It is therefore important to identify\n            certain rural development income generation/beneficiary\n            development schemes for the benefit of vulnerable PAPs\n            affected by building rural roads under the PMGSY, and amend\n            those identified schemes to build in the criteria and\n            provisions for inclusion of adversely affected project\n            affected persons (PAPs) of PMGSY belonging to vulnerable sections."}, "docdt": "2012-09-25T00:00:00Z"}
