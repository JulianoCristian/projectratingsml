2.     Project implementation progress: Both the implementation progress and achievement of Project
Development Objectives (PDO) are satisfactory and the project is approaching a satisfactory closure.
About 9,400 km rural roads, out of a total of 11,462 km planned at appraisal, have been completed. 91%
of loan proceeds have been disbursed. Expected outcomes are on track, notably the level of road user
satisfaction has been high, based on road user satisfaction surveys being undertaken in the participating
states. No audit report is pending from any of the participating states. The project was extended in March
2010 by 24 months to complete the additional road works in Rajasthan (91Km) and Uttar Pradesh (382
Km), and to further consolidate ongoing institutional development initiatives, especially on road
maintenance.

3.       Reasons for the proposed reallocation: The proposed reallocation will facilitate a satisfactory
conclusion to institutional development initiatives under the project. Currently, the remaining activities
under the project are being funded through Loan 4753 IN, under which all the funds are allocated to the
"works" category. Reallocation of funds to other categories under the Loan would help financing of
institutional related work being undertaken, such as the work of technical examiners who are conducting
regular quality inspections, operationalization of the maintenance management system, training of rural
road engineers, and procurement of lab equipment. The reallocation is based on the proposal received
from the Ministry of Rural Development (MORD) dated July 2, 2010 routed through DEA on September
28, 2010.
