The project is being implemented in\n            four states i.e. Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, and\n            Uttar Pradesh. Jharkhand has not performed well under the\n            project although planned works on 150 km of roads in that\n            state are nearly completed. Under a previous restructuring,\n            funds that were originally allocated for use in Jharkhand\n            were reallocated to Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. The\n            extension will help the National Rural Roads Development\n            Agency (NRRDA) and the participating states to: (a) further\n            consolidate the institutional development initiatives,\n            including innovative methods to plan and execute maintenance\n            works; (b) complete the ongoing and additional rural roads\n            works to be taken up from the recently reallocated funds to\n            Uttar Pradesh ($ 27 m) and Rajasthan ($ 9 m). These works\n            are scheduled for completion by December 2011. In addition,\n            some ongoing works in Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh\n            will not be complete until December 31, 2010; and, (c)\n            undertake further capacity building activities planned for\n            rural roads agencies."}, "docdt": "2010-03-27T00:00:00Z"}
