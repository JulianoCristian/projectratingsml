increased production, marketing and processing of\n            non-coffee commodities.  This strategy would lead to\n            substantial increases in food production and a reduction in\n            the economy's vulnerability to price changes and market\n            constraints on coffee, thereby assisting the country in\n            reducing overproduction and costly stock build-up of coffee.\n            The project would accelerate significantly the\n            borrower's ongoing diversification efforts and help\n            make diversification a more self-sustaining process through\n            provision of:  (i) credit for agricultural production,\n            processing and marketing; and (ii) related support services,\n            including technical assistance, applied agricultural\n            research and a price and marketing information system."}, "docdt": "1984-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
