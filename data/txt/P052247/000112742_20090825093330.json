sustainability is likely; institutional\n            development impact is modest; Bank performance is\n            satisfactory; and Borrower performance is unsatisfactory.\n            The ICR process for this project included a Beneficiary\n            Survey and two Stakeholder Workshops. The key lessons are\n            divided into those learned for the fisheries sector in\n            general, those learned for the future of Moroccan fisheries,\n            and those learned for future Bank interventions.  Lessons\n            learned for fisheries include the following:  The most\n            important lesson is that reform in the fisheries sector is a\n            long-term affair.  A related lesson is that the Bank can\n            play a key catalytic role in a fisheries sector at a time\n            when government and the industry are trying to develop new\n            paths of cooperation in sector management. A third lesson is\n            that where a high rent sector like fisheries is concerned,\n            the pressures are enormous, fiscal policy is key, and policy\n            and institutional arrangements have to be absolutely clear\n            if rent seeking behavior is not to lead to over investment\n            and to over-extraction. A fourth and related lesson is that\n            management must be accompanied by good monitoring. A clear\n            message was key sector services such as fisheries research\n            and stock assessment tend to be shunted aside by rent\n            seeking behavior unless governance is transparent and\n            mechanisms are in place to ensure that they are properly\n            financed and fed into transparent management decisions. A\n            strong management system may be based either on strong\n            Government regulation or on an industry-managed\n            self-regulatory system but management depends on the\n            existence of strong monitoring capability. The Stakeholder\n            Workshop in Rabat emphasized that policy on rent extraction\n            has to be backed up by fiscal recovery mechanisms that are\n            recognized as efficient and equitable. Lessons learned for\n            the future of Moroccan fisheries touched on the need for the\n            gender unit to be confirmed in the management structure and\n            have a regular line budget of its own; highlighted the role\n            of fishermen in pointing out the risk of over fishing and\n            calling for management and monitoring that increased\n            quality, not quantity; confirmed that the Good Practice\n            Guides are powerful tools for promoting environmental\n            awareness among stakeholders; and noted that the project\n            format was seen as too cumbersome, the procurement and\n            consultant management tasks too slow and ponderous so that\n            the Bank and Morocco should form a strategic partnership.\n            General lessons for Bank interventions note that where a\n            project is a broad-ranging pilot, flexibility should be\n            built in, but there should be rules for agreeing and\n            implementing adaptations to the original design; and that\n            the project proved a valuable transition instrument in this\n            sector because sector stakeholders placed a high value on\n            this project-although it was small and perhaps relatively\n            negligible in the eyes of the Government or the Bank."}, "docdt": "2004-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
