support the objectives of the Country Assistance\n            Strategy (CAS), encouraging private sector development,\n            through the promotion and competitiveness increase of the\n            fisheries sector. Further objectives call for public sector\n            reform, which the project will address through\n            decentralization and private sector initiatives. Social and\n            rural development strengthening, will be reinforced through\n            expansion of small-scale and coastal fisheries development.\n            The project contains two main components, as follows: 1)\n            strengthening the institutional capacity of the Ministry of\n            Marine Fisheries (MOMF) to manage and develop the fisheries\n            sector. This component includes institutional reforms,\n            supporting decentralization and organizational\n            restructuring, in addition to an administrative\n            reorganization. The decentralization process will improve\n            with the inclusion of an integrated management information\n            systems, providing computer equipment and technical\n            assistance. Furthermore, major sectoral planning will\n            include monitoring and coordination of future fisheries\n            development, and will support the creation of the Unit for\n            Women's Advancement, quantifying the role of women in\n            the sector; 2) pilot marketing development will support the\n            fishing fleet upgrade, and improve landing conditions. In\n            addition, marketing and processing conditions will also be improved."}, "docdt": "1999-04-13T00:00:00Z"}
