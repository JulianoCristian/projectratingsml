"The Reconstruction Project for Eastern\n            Slavonia, Baranja, and Western Srijem seeks to repair and\n            rebuild the war-damage water sector infrastructure while\n            mitigating the negative environmental impact likely to be\n            caused to an adjacent nature park by the restart of local\n            agriculture. The project consists of four components. First,\n            the wastewater management component will complete\n            construction of the wastewater treatment for Vinkovci and\n            extend the wastewater collection system thereby increasing\n            the population served from 65 percent to 85 percent. Second,\n            the flood control and drainage component will repair Baranja\n            flood protection system. The work consists of repairing\n            levees and draining systems and reconstructing pump\n            stations. Third, the clearing of landmines component will\n            verify that all construction sites are mine-free. Fourth,\n            the nature protection component will develop and strengthen\n            the State Directorate for the Protection of Nature and\n            Environment, construct facilities and provide equipment."}, "docdt": "1998-05-21T00:00:00Z"}
