Performances\n            are rated as satisfactory in the case of the Bank, and\n            highly satisfactory in the Borrower's case. Lessons\n            first indicate that the denomination of the Loan in Deutsche\n            Mark (DEM) and then in Euros helped mitigate the exchange\n            rate risk, for denominating the Loan in the currency in\n            which major contracts are procured helps limit the exchange\n            rate risk. Given the evolution of the exchange rate, in 2003\n            and 2004, when about Euro 30 million were disbursed, the\n            denomination of the Loan in USD would have generated\n            important losses. Second, by combining infrastructure and\n            nature protection components, synergies are increased\n            through the development of integrated approaches. In\n            addition, treating mine clearing activities as part of a\n            regular civil work contract, increases transparency and\n            financial efficiency. Competitive selection of such\n            activities within civil works contracts increased\n            competition, and contributed to reducing prices\n            significantly. Moreover, the inclusion of de-mining as part\n            of regular civil works contracts ensured timeliness in\n            implementation. Finally, the Bank should promote flexibility\n            as an incentive to efficient Project management. The quality\n            of procurement and the knowledge of Bank procedures by\n            experienced teams, contributes to increase competition, and\n            efficient financial management, eventually, translating into savings."}, "docdt": "2005-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
