INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE
PRESIDENT
TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON THE PROPOSED LOAN
TO BRAZIL
FOR A LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
August 31, 1967



INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND R7COMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
E:ECUJTIVE DIRECTORS ON THE PROPOSED
LOAN TO BRAZIL FOR A LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in amounts in various currencies equivalent to $40 million.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.       W4hen a Bank economic mission visited Brazil in 1964, it identi-
fied livestock production in Central and Southern Brazil as one of the most
promising means of increasing the supply of food for the domestic market
and for export. Thereafter, the Government, the Bank and the Food and
Agricultural Organization of the United Nations cooperated very closely in
fcrnulating a project which could be suitable for financing by the Bank.
The Government, on its part, set up a Commission of livestock and agricul-
tural credit experts to prepare a project. At various stages of the
Commission's work, the Bank and FAO provided assistance through frequent
visits by their technical personnel.
3.        In the summer of 1966, the project and a loan application for its
financing were submitted by the Government to the Bank. The project was
appraised bv the Bank in the fall of 1966.
4.        In March 1967 the Bank invited the representatives of the Govern-
ment for negotiations. The Government was represented by: Messrs. Francisco
Cunha Ribeiro (leader of the negotiating team), Wilson Egito Coelho, Diogo
Dias Paes Leme, Paulo Campos Bricio and Victor Weyrauch. Presentation of the
loan to the Executive Directors was delayed until now mainly because of the
time required to establish the technical agencies in charge of carrying out
the proœect.
5.        During the various stages of the preparation of the project, and
during negotiations, the representatives of the Government and the Bank dis-
cussed the marketing and export conditions that would be necessary to provide
adequate incentive for the expansion of livestock production and for economic
use of the funds available for investments.  The Government and the Bank were
in agreement that these objectives could best be achieved in a market free
from price, marketing and export controls, except for routine administrative
purposes.  In previous years, the exigencies of inflation had resulted in
controls on domestic prices, a discriminatory export tax on meat and quanti-
tative limitations on sales abroad. The application of such controls varied
from year to year and from season to season. Producers and exporters there-
fore had no basis for long-range planning and investment. The Government has
now removed all domestic price and export controls on meat.
6.        The proposed loan would bring the total number of Bank loans to
Brazil to twenty-two and would increase total Bank lending to Brazil to
$536.1 million (net of cancellations). The following is a summary of Bank
loans to Brazil as of July 31, 1967:

7.        The above undisbursed amount includes $149.6 million for power
loans signed in March and December 1966, which became effective in May/June
1967.  For the Xavantes project (Loan 404-BR), there were almost no dis-
bursements for more than two years after the signing date - first, because
of the delay in the approval of the loan by the Sao Paulo state legislature
and second, because in late 1966 the Sao Paulo state government decided to
amalgamate all state power companies. P'lacing orders, the execution of work

on the prolect, and hence disbursements, were held up by the legal and ad-
ministrative formalities of amalgamation and the assumption of the Bank loan
by the new company. These formalities have now been completed and the Bank
resumed disbursements in early June 1967. Work on this project has also
been delayed by heavy rains.
8.        Negotiations for a proposed Bank loan of $22 million for the
ALCOMINAS Aluminum Project were completed on July 27. The project consists
of mining, refining and smelting facilities for aluminum production, to be
built by ALCOMINAS at Pocos de Caldas in the State of Minas Gerais.   Presen-
tation of this Loan to the Executive Directors is awaiting approval of the
draft Loan documents by the Governmen-t and is expected to take place in
October 1967.
9.        As of July 31, 1967, IFC had five investments in Brazil; two pro-
jects are completed and three are underway:

PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
10.       Borrower:                 Brazil.
Amount:                  The equivalent in various currencies of
$40 million.
Purpose:                 To help finance long-term loans by com-
mercial banks for the development of
livestock production in Central and
Southern Brazil.



-4 -
Amortization:            Term of 20 years, including a 6-1/2-year
grace peri;od, with semi-annual payment
dates of March 15 and September 15 and
payments beginning on March 15, 1974 and
ending on September 15, 1987.
Interest Rate:           6 percent per annum.
Commitment Charge:       3/8 of one percent.
PART III - THE PROJECT
11.       An appraisal report entitled, "Livestock Development Project -
Brazil" (To0-583b) is attached.
12.       Livestock production accounts for about 8 to 10 percent of
Brazil's gross national product and about one-third of the agricultural
production.  The increase in livestock production has barely kept pace with
the growing domestic demand and, despite the vast potential, exports have
been small. The main limiting factors have been restrictive price and
export policies, inadequate funds for long-term investment, cattle diseases,
and inefficient management of pastures.   The Government has taken remedial
action in respect of each of these problems.
13.       The Project is a livestock credit operation in selected areas in
the States of Rio Grande do Sul, Mato Grosso, Goias, Minas Gerais, Sao Paulo
and Parana. Its purpose is to increase the production of beef, mutton and
wool for domestic consumption, as well as for export. The total cost of
the ProJect, including technical services, is estimated at US8O million.
It is proposed to finance $40 million from the Bank loan. The Brazilian
Government would nrovide about $25 million and the remaining $15 million
would come from the farmers' own resources.
14.       Funds from the proposed loan and the Government's contribtution
would be lent to farmers for pasture establishment and improvement, construc-
tion of silos, purchases of agricultural machinery, fencing and watering
facilities and, in some areas, for the purchase of breeding cattle. About
1,800 farms covering an area of about half a million hectares would benefit
from lending under the Project (Para. 22, appraisal report).
15.       Sixteen years after the beginning of operations, annual output on
the farms benefitting from the credit operation is expected to have in-
creased by about 160 percent for beef, 270 percent for mutton, and 80 per-
cent for wool.
16.       Funds for the Project would be channelled to the farmers through
comrmercial banks, which would rediscount their loans with the Central Bank.
To assist the farmers in preparing sound investment plans and to evaluate
them for lending by commercial banks, the Government has taken steps to set
up one national and three regional project offices, all to be supervised by
a national commission (Para. 53, appraisal report).



-5-
17.       The Brazilian inflation ra-sed some difficult problems about the
terms of lend4ng to farmers. On the one hand, there were banks and private
lenders who lent for a very short period at exorbitant rates. On the other,
the meager medium and long-term funds provided through Government institu-
tions were lent at highly subsidized rates. Under the loan arrangements,
the livestock producer would receive loans from commercial banks up to
80 percent of his investment with a term up to 12 years and a grace period
up to 4 years. Since the last of these sub-loans under the proposed program
would not be made until 6 years from now, and taking into account the possi-
bility of some delays in repayments by livestock producers, it is necessary
to provide a term of 20 years for the final amortization of the Bank loan.
Repayments from livestock producers to the commercial banks and the Central
Bank would, at least if they were all made punctually, accumulate after 9
or 10 years in amounts greater than those required to service the Bank loan.
To this extent, temporary surpluses would be available during the second
decade of this loan operation fcr further short-term lending in the livestock
area. Interest would be charged by the commercial banks at the rate of
14 percent, which would include their comnmission. The loans to the producers
would be indexed in order to protect the principal (and interest) from
erosion by inflation. (Para. 37-40, appraisal report and draft supplemental
letter on Policies and Procedures.)
18.       To combat foot and mouth disease, the Government has agreed to
undertake an expanded program of vaccination in the Project area and com-
pulsory vaccination on the farms benefitting from the Project. (Para. 54,
appraisal report and Section 5.13 draft Loan Agreement).
19.       Procurement from the proceeds of the Bank loan would be made
through normal marketing channels. Bulk procurement and international com-
petitive bidding would not be practicable in view of the varying require-
ments of individual farmers and the need to procure machinery which can be
serviced and repaired locally. While most of the equipment required is
manufactured in Brazil and sold at competitive prices, there is some equip-
ment which will be imported, and the locally manufactured equipment
incorporates some imported materials and components. The direct and indirect
import component of the Project is estimated at $14 million. This relatively
low foreign exchange content is, of course, characteristic of agricultural
credit and livestock projects (see also para. 28 below).
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
20.       The draft Loan Agreement between Brazil and the Bank, the draft
Project Agreement between Banco Central do Brasil and the Bank, the draft
Supplemental Letters on operating policies and procedures and on controls,
and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii)
of the Articles of Agreement, are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
21.       The draft Loan and Project Agreements follow the usual patterns of
agricultural loans of the same nature. The Banco Central will enter into



- 6 -
Subsidiary Loan Agreements satisfactory to the Bank with the commercial banks
participating in the Pro'ect. The draft Loan Agreement also includes a
provision giving the Bank a right to suspend disbursements of the loan
should the Government decide to adopt measures which would adversely and
materially affect the economic benefits expected to result from the Project.
(Section 6.02(a)). The draft letter on controls embodies the understanding
that, subject to a number of expressed exceptions, the adoption of price
and export controls on beef, mutton and wool are to be regarded, prima facie,
as matters adversely and materially affecting the economic benefits ex-
pected to result from the Project. The draft Supplemental Letter on
policies and procedures is a statement of the relending procedures.
PART V - THE ECONOMY AND PROSPECTS FOR FURTHER LENDING
22.       In 1964 the Castelo Branco Government prepared a program for the
control of inflation, resumption of economic growth and restoration of
external liauidity. During the last three years, progress on the economic
front has been substantial.  The rate of inflationary price increases has
declined; the balance of payments position has imDroved. An impressive
array of institutions has been built up. Despite these achievements, how-
ever, the country continues to face some formidable problems in its stabili-
zation effort, especially regarding the control of the fiscal deficit.
23.       A memorandum on the economic situation and prospects of Brazil is
attached to this report. It is based on the findings of a Banli economic
mission which visited Brazil twice this year and which is now preparing its
final report. After a review of the Government's investment program, the
likely future trend of exports and imports, and Brazil's external debt
service obligations, the mission found that Brazil's gross foreign caDital
requirements during 196771 would be about $600 million annually. Brazil
would have to draw on private, Government and international sources of
funds to meet these requirements. Given the improvement in economic per-
formance in the last three years, and the prospects for further progress,
Brazil is creditworthy for further Bank lending.
24.       After an interruption of six years, the Bank resumed lending in
Brazil in 1965, first, merely in order to maintain its net investment so
that repayments on loans to Brazil would not exceed new loan disbursements,
but later on for the more positive purpose of giving support to the economic
policy objectives of the new Government. As shown above, since 1965 the
Bank's lending has been concentrated in electric power. The electric power
program was well defined, a number of economically feasible projects were
available, and the power companies were well organized and administered.
25.       At the same time, the Bank participated with the Government in a
program of sector studies and project preparation. In 1965 a survey of the
transportation system, comprising the railways, coastal shipping, the three
major ports and highways in four South-Central states, was initiated partly
with Bank financing. A second phase of this survey, covering highways in the
remaining states, is in progress now. The UNDP and the AID have agreed to
finance this phase and the Bank is the executing agency. A study of the



- 7 -
steel industry, partly financed by the Bank, has been completed and in-
cludes a long-range investrment program. A study of the power sector in
the Center South has been completed. The UNDP financed part of the cost
of the study and the Bank uas the executing agency.  A similar study for
the Southern region is in progress. Bank economic missions in recent years
have included education experts assigned by UNESCO. However, so far this
has not resulted in the identification of education projects suitable for
Bank financing. In agriculture, the Bank and the FAO have assisted the
Government in preparing the livestock project and an agricultural storage
project. As a result of these efforts, the Bank is now in a position to
move into new and important areas of development investment.
26.       The power projects financed by the Bank, when completed, will
make an important contribution towards meeting the growing demands for
electric power and building strong and financially viable corporations.
In transportation and agriculture, however, substantial reforms are still
needed. In many branches of transport, the large deficits have to be
reduced and, ultimately, eliminated.  The Government would need to under-
take substantial investments, organizational changes, operational improve-
ments and rate and fare changes. A blueprint for these is provided in
the transport survey reports sponsored and partly financed by the Bank.
In agriculture, the years of inflation have eroded the channels for the
flow of long-term investment funds, except for the resources of public
institutions. There is need to provide ways in which funds can flow in
accordance with economic criteria. The proposed livestock loan is an
attempt in this direction. Bank lending in transport and agriculture, if
accompanied by improvements in organization and operations, would signi-
ficantly contribute to the stabilization and development policies of the
Government.
27.       Considering these circumstances, and in view of the fact that
the Bank's lending can cover only a part of Brazil's external capital needs,
and that, in general, other sectors appear to be in a much better position
to find finance from other sources on reasonable terms, it would appear
appropriate for the Bank, in its lending to Brazil over the next few years,
to attach higher priority to transportation and agriculture and perhaps
education. An appraisal report is now being prepared for a highway project.
Project preparation is in progress for a second highway project and an
agricultural storage project. Moreover, as a result of the transport survey,
railways, ports and additional highway projects could be ready for external
financing in 1969.
28.       Concentration on lending for agriculture and transport brings
with it the necessity of considering the financing of substantial local
expenditure. Brazil needs substantial amounts of capital from abroad to
supplement its domestic resources, but it is a country with an advanced
industrial sector producing most types of capital goods. Hence, it would
be uneconomic, even if it were practicable, to transfer capital from abroad
wholly in conventional form in imported equipment and supplies for develop-
ment projects. This is particularly true in lending for agriculture and
transportation. In most countries many types of agricultural projects tend
to have a relatively small foreign exchange content; and in Brazil in
particular there exist industries producing agricultural and transportation



- 8 -
equipment and supplies which are quite competitive (at least with a small
margin of nreference) with imported goods. These points are illustrated
by the project which is now before you. Hence, if we are to cover a
reasonable proportion of the total cost when we finance agricultural and
transportation projects in Brazil, and if we desire to have a significant
impact in obtaining operational and organizational reforms in these fields,
we will have to be prepared to go beyond the financing of import require-
ments and to cover some portion of the necessary local currency expenditures.
mne same will be true if we succeed in finding useful education projects.
All of these comments, however, are subject to the reservation that I plan
to schedule a discussion by the Executive Directors in the reasonably near
fut-ure of the broad policy question of local expenditure financing by the
Bank and IDA, and our future approach on this matter in Brazil, as elsewhere,
will depend on the outcome of these discussions.
29.       After reviewing the potentialities for further lending operations
in Brazil, I should also add that the extent to which we shall be able to
realize these potentialities depends partly upon the satisfactory completion
of the necessary project preparation, but also - and very importantly - upon
the progress made by the Brazilian Government in achieving its announced
objectives in the fields of economic stabilization and development.
PART VI - COINPLIAMCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREE1MENT
30.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOPEIENDATION
31.       I recommend that the Executive Directors adopt the following
resolution:
Resolution No.
Approval of loan to Brazil in an amount
eauivalent to US$40,000,000.
RESOLVED:
That the Bank shall grant a loan to Brazil in an amount in various
currencies equivalent to forty million United States dollars (uS$40,000,coo),
to mature on and prior to September 15, 1987, to bear interest at the rate
of six nercent (6%) per annum, and to be upon such other terms and conditions
as shall be substantially in accordance with the terms and conditions set
forth in the form of Loan Agreement (Livestock Development Project) between
Brazil and the Bank, and the form of Project Agreement (Livestock Development
Prolect) between Banco Central do Brasil and the Bank, which have been
presented to this meeting.

Memorandum on the Economic Situation in Brazil
(Exchange Rate: US$1=2,700 Cruzeiros=2.70 New Cruzeiros - NCr.)
Recent Developments
1.      During the past three years, the Brazilian Government has made
vigorous efforts to control inflation, to improve efficiency and stimu-
late growth and to restore balance in Brazil's trade and payments. By
the end of 1966 the annual rate of price increases had been reduced to
L0 percent from about 90 percent in 1964; the GDP growth rate had in-
creased to h.b percent from 3.1 percent in 196b; all external arrears
and most of the short-term debts had been liquidated and substantial
foreign reserves had been built up. W4hile formidable problems continue
to face the new Government, these are less critical than the problems
of economic management and reform faced by its predecessor in 196b.
2.      The Government of Marshal Costa e Silva, which assumed office
in March 1967, has expressed its intention to pursue the same general
policies for stabilization, growth and external balance as did the pre-
vious Government. In the choice of particular measures it is guided by
the experience of the last three years, as well as by the requirements
of new situations as they emerge. In the last five months, it has gone
through two phases in its economic policy. In the first phase, from
MIarch to June, the Government's main concern was to stimulate the economy,
which was in an industrial recession earlier this year. Taxes were reduced,
the coffee support price was increased, and credit to the private sector
was eased. Partly due to the tax reductions and partly owing to the liqui-
dation of large unpaid bills of 1966, the fiscal deficit in the first half
of 1967 increased substantially. In the current second phase, the Govern-
ment's thinking is that its policy to stimulate industry has achieved its
purpose. Stringent measures have now been taken to control government
expenditures, and the fiscal program for the second half of the year is
aiming at a surplus in government accounts, though it is doubtful whether
this will actually be achieved.
3.      The general level of prices increased by about 40 percent in 1966.
In the first seven months of this year, the cost of living had risen by
19 percent and wholesale prices by 13 percent. For the year as a whole,
the Government plans to limit the price rise to about 30 percent. This
target appears realistic in view of the restrictions on credit expansion
and measures taken to limit the Federal Government's budget deficit.
h.      In 1966 gross domestic product increased by h.. percent, despite
a decline in agricultural production. Industrial production increased
by about 12 percent, continuing the recovery begun in the second half of
1965, after a recession had affected the consumer goods industries. The



outlook for the current year is for a similar increase in GDP. Agri-
cultural production, handicapped by adverse weather conditions in 1966,
is likely to register an increase.
5.      The deficit on current account in the balance of payments was
US$53 million in 1966 and is likely to be more than US$150 million in
1967. Imports, which rose substantially in 1966, have continued to
increase at a fairly high rate. Exports this year have lagged behind
1966 exports, largely as a result of a decline in coffee exports. The
decline in gross reserves of the monetary authorities during the first
five months was about US$70 million; this left gross reserves (including
an estimated US$45 million in commercial bank reserves) at about US$380
million or the equivalent of 3 months' imports. The Government is con-
cerned about the balance of payments situation and has expressed its
intention to take appropriate corrective measures if necessary.
6.      The following is a brief account of performance and future pros-
pects in respect of the three major objectives of the Government's economic
policy: control of inflation; economic growth and efficiency; and main-
tenance of external balance and liquidity.
Control of Inflation
7.      In domestic stabilization the emphasis in the Government's policy
is on the reduction of the public sector deficit, restriction of credit
expansion and limitation of wage increases.
(a) Fiscal deficit
8.      The Federal Government's cash deficit declined (in constant 1966
cruzeiros) from NCr. 1,h77 million (3.7 percent of GDP) in 1964 to NCr.
587 million (1.h percent of GDP) in 1966. In the first half of 1967 the
deficit increased (in real terms) by more than L0 percent over the deficit
for the whole of 1966. Expenditures increased sharply this year because
substantial payments for work done in 1966 were made in 1967. Moreover,
at the beginning of this year there was a 25 percent wage increase for
public employees. Tax receipts were lower than expected owing to the
reductions decreed in April to stimulate industrial production.
9.      In the last two months the Government has adopted some strong
measures to limit expenditures. For the second half of the year the
Government plans a fiscal surplus and aims at a year-end deficit no
higher (in real terms) than last year's. It is unlikely that it will
succeed in achieving a surplus for the second semester of 1967. However,
the measures already adopted may enable the Government to attain a near
balance between receipts and expenditures. Although the year-end deficit
would still be larger than last year's, this would be a considerable im-
provement over the performance in the first semester of 1967.
10.     One of the most difficult problems in the stabilization effort
is the control of the deficits of the State Governments. These are



- 3 -
financed partly by direct transfers from the Federal budget and partly
also by the banking system - through the direct borrowing of the States
from the banking system and the extension of credit to the States by
suppliers and contractors who in turn obtain financing from the banking
system. The Federal Government is increasingly aware of this and is
taking measures to restrict the expansion of bank credit to finance the
State Government deficits.
11.     Taxes at all levels of government account for more than 30 per-
cent of Brazil's gross domestic product, and further substantial tax
increases would reduce the private sectoris contribution to economic
growth.  In its effort to control fiscal deficits the Government is
placing increasing emphasis on improving the efficiency of public ex-
penditure.  Operating subsidies to the transport sector accounted for
about two-thirds of the Federal Government's deficit in 1966. Tb reduce
this burden, the Government is preparing a plan of action to improve the
operation of transport entities, to eliminate uneconomic facilities and
to reform their rate structures.
(b) Credit policy
12.     There has been a rapid decline in the rate of credit expansion
in the last three years. The banking system's loans to the private
sector increased by 80 percent in 196b, 57 percent in 1965 and 32 per-
cent in 1966. For the current year the Government expects to limit
credit expansion to the private sector to about 30 percent, which appears
to be consistent with its overall stabilization objectives.
13.     Inflation has made borrowing an attractive proposition, and pri-
vate industry has become heavily dependent on bank credit for its working
capital. Moreover, protection, easy credit and excess demand have resulted
in some rigidity in the structure of industry and in industrial costs. The
managers of the monetary policy are very conscious of the possibility that
excessive credit restrictions might lead to urban unemployment and pro-
duction cutbacks. Thus credit was eased toward the end of 1965 and again
in early 1967 to bring the economy out of recession.
ih.     Through compulsory reserve requirements and other regulations,
the Central Bank has a fair amount of control over the operations of
private banks, and can take direct action with the Banco do Brasil. How-
ever, as the private sector was squeezed and the demand for credit con-
tinued to increase, an unofficial "parallel market" developed as an
important source of credit to the private sector. The growth of this
market has been reinforced by the unrealistically low rates in commercial
banking, where the depositor does not obtain a positive return on his
savings. The parallel market has provided a channel for funds seeking
higher returns and for credit demand unsatisfied by commercial banks.
However, the high interest rates in this market have emerged as an import-
ant cost push in the present inflation.



(c) Wages
15.     In the stabilization effort, one of the most successful policies
has been the control of wages. In the public and the private sectors
there has been a fairly rigorous application of the policy of annual
adjustments limited to the restoration of the average real wages of the
previous tw;enty-four months. The present Government has successfully
resisted pressures for a relaxation of this policy and has announced its
intention to continue the limitation on wage increases in order to con-
tain inflationary pressures.
(d) Coffee policy
16.     The Government's consistent aim in the coffee sector in recent
years has been to generate cash surpluses on coffee operations and to
diversify from coffee to other agricultural products. Thus, in 1966,
the coffee support price was kept constant at the 1965 level, despite
a 10 percent general price increase in the meantime. Surpluses on the
Govenlment's coffee operations provided an offset for nearly half of the
public sector's deficit in 1966. A large program of eradication of coffee
trees and of diversification into alternate crops was undertaken. For the
current season the Government has increased the coffee support price by
35 percent. Since the Government considers that surplus capacity has
been largely removed, it has stopped for the time being the financing of
eradication. A definitive judgment on whether these measures will lead
to major new plantings is not possible at the present stage. The Govern-
ment's view is that there will not be major new plantings. The monetary
effects of the June price increase are in doubt: the crop is now expected
to be relatively small, and this should lead to a surplus in the coffee
account. But if external sales (and therefore the proceeds of the coffee
export tax) remain sluggish, this surplus may not materialize.
(e) "Corrective Inflation"
17.     Progress in stabilizing the economy has been impressive.  Yet
more remains to be done. Further progress will be dependent partly upon
the reduction of inefficiencies in the public and the private sectors.
In the public sector the proposed program for the control of the trans-
port deficit should make an important contribution to this. However,
the need for "corrective increases" for public utility rates, rents
and other prices regulated by the Government may continue to limit some-
what the rate of deceleration of increase in the price level. Up to 1964
public utility rates and rents lagged substantially behind inflationary
price increases. Since then the Government has adopted the policy of frequent
adjustment of public utility rates to cover costs and provide an adequate
return on investments; rents have also been gradually adjusted. These
necessary adjustments have contributed significantly to general price
increases over the past three years, and the process is by no means over
yet.



Investment and growth
18.     Growth in the last three years has been moderate, with per capita
income rising scarcely at aUl. Gross fixed capital formation in the
public sector has, however, been absorbing an increasing proportion of
the gross domestic product (10.3 percent in 1966, as compared with 8.2
percent in 196b). It is private investment that has lagged seriously,
its share of GDP declining from 5.9 percent in 1964 to 3.8 percent in
1966. No significant recovery can be expected in private investment
this year, while public investment is likely to decline slightly in real
terms as a result of the steps being taken to reduce the fiscal deficit.
19.     The stagnation of private investment underlines the conflicts that
exist in the short-run between growth and stabilization objectives. In-
creased taxation and credit restraints in recent years dried up some of
the resources available for private investment and increased the cost of
the resources that were available. In industry, firms which were accustomed
to excess demand, easy credit and multiple exchange rates face new problems
of adjusting to credit restraints, a rapidly disappearing excess demand,
liberal imports, and, in 1966, a decline in tariffs. A competitive spirit
and cost consciousness are visible in some areas:  exports of non-traditional
products (manufactures and agricultural products with growing international
markets, such as rice, maize, meat, etc.) increased by 90 percent, from
US$280 million in 1963 to US$5h6 million in 1966.  However, the process of
adjustment is slow and painful. The objectives of rapidly increasing public
and private investment can be reconciled with stabilization only by a real
reduction of the Government's current expenditure. The Government is gradu-
ally proceeding in this direction, but it will take time.
20.     Meanwhile, in the public sector, a major program is in progress to
improve and expand facilities in electric power, transportation, petroleum
and steel, and these four sectors, together with credit to private in-
dustry, are expected to account for nearly two-thirds of the total program
for financing investments in 1967-71. The Government is presently engaged
in preparing a revised public investment program for this period.
21.     The Bank and the UNDP have made an important contribution to Brazil's
investment effort. In 1965 a survey of the transportation system, com-
prising the railways, coastal shipping, the three major ports and highways
in four South-Central states, was initiated partly with Bank financing.
A second phase of this survey, covering highways in the remaining states,
is in progress now. The UNDP and the AID have agreed to finance this phase,
and the Bank is the executing agency. A study of the steel industry, partly
financed by the Bank, has been completed and includes a long-range invest-
ment program. A study of the power sector in the Center South has been
completed. The UNDP financed part of the cost of the study, and the Bank
was the executing agency. A similar study for the Southern region is in
progress.
22.     Economic growth in the fifties and the early sixties was the result
of massive import substitution, expansion of infrastructure and a moderate



-6-
expansion of agricultural production. During 1950-62, GDP grew at 6
percent, industrial production at 9 percent and agriculture at b.7 per-
cent per year. Following a short period of stagnation and explosive
inflation, the last three years have been a period for institutional
reform and the difficult process of reconciliation between the objec-
tives of growth and stabilization. This process is by no means over,
and there are many uncertainties inherent in the situation. Resumption
of rapid growth would depend to some extent on the elimination of in-
efficiencies in the public and the private sectors, fostered by past
inf'-ation. In view of the progress made so far, and in view of the
Government's commitment to continue its efforts to accelerate growth and
to improve efficiency, the Bank economic mission projects an annual GDP
growth rate of 6 percent for 1967-71. The rate of growth of industrial
output is likely to be slower than in the fifties - 7 percent against
9 percent - since the obvious opportunities of import substitution have
been exhausted, and further industrial expansion would have to be based
on the expansion of the domestic market and exports. Agricultural pro-
duction is likely to increase at 5 percent - the potential for agricultural
expansion is high,   and measures taken to provide investment funds and
short-term credit and the freeing of markets for agricultural products
should make a significant contribution to the realizatiqpcf this potential.
External Aecounts
23.     Projections made by the Bank mission suggest that the external
deficit on current account may widen to US$300 million by 1971. However,
it would still be only about 1 percent of the GDP. Between 1966 and 1971
exports are expected to grow at an annual rate of about b½ percent, some-
what less than the projected GDP growth rate of 5½ percent.   Traditional
agricultural exports such as coffee, cocoa and sugar constituted more
than two-thirds of Brazil's exports in 1966, and are likely to grow at
less than 2 percent. However, non-traditional exports should continue to
do well, and a growth rate for total exports in excess of 10 percent a
year can be expected in the period ahead. Imports, which have been de-
pressed in recent years, are likely to grow at a little over 6 percent
per annum.
2h.     Brazilian external debt structure, which has for many years been
exceptionally unfavorable, has recently been greatly improved by the re-
payment of short-term debts and a sizeable inflow of official loans wTith
long maturities and grace periods. Of the total medium and long-term
debt of US$3.3 billion outstanding at the end of 1966, only 20 percent
consisted of suppliers' credits, and although projected service on present
debt -will be very high during the next twio years, the debt service ratio
on existing debt tapers off rapidly after 1968 and will have fallen to
about 12 percent of projected current account receipts by 1970-71. This
is roughly half the average for the past decade. 1/
1/ Projected debt service payments are showm in Table 6 attached. It
should be noted that the figures in this table include service on
private debt not guaranteed by the Government. If this debt were to
be excluded, the debt service ratio would be significantly lower, but
the available data do not permit a precise calculation.



- 7 -
25.     Although more than 90 percent of gross domestic capital formation
is likely to be financed from Brazil's own savings during the next few
years, the resumption of a satisfactory growth rate and the service on
existing debt will require sizeable gross capital inflows. These, at
present, are estimated at a minimum of US$600 million per year over the
next five years, of which amortization payments account for between one
half and two-thirds. Debt service on both the existing and the new debt
as a proportion of current account receipts should be falling below the
20 percent level by 1971. The terms of borrowing in this period will,
however, determine whether the trend moves upward again in the 1970s.
Provided that the required amounts are forthcoming at reasonable terms,
Brazil is likely to be able to manage its external accounts in a manner
consistent with its domestic growth and stabilization objectives.
Conclusion
26.     The new Government has indicated a policy of continuity in the
pursuit of stability, external balance and domestic growth. The dif-
ficulties in the pursuit of each of these and in their mutual recon-
ciliation are numerous. A determined effort, and frequently unpopular
measures, will be necessary if a reasonably satisfactory rate of growth
is to be maintained. A key element in this effort will be the cooperation
and assistance of external lending agencies in finding requisite foreign
capital and in providing lending terms which will prevent a re-emergence
of the situation of the early sixties. In view of Brazil's performance
in growth, stabilization and management of the balance of payments, and
the promise of continued progress, Brazil is justified in continuing to
borrow moderate amounts of capital from abroad to finance its investment
program.
