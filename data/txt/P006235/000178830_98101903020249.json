Funds from the\n            proposed loan and the Government's contribution would\n            be lent to farmers for pasture establishment and\n            improvement, construction of silos, purchases of\n            agricultural machinery, fencing and watering facilities and,\n            in some areas, for the purchase of breeding cattle. About\n            1,800 farms covering an area of about half a million\n            hectares would benefit from lending under the project."}, "docdt": "1967-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
