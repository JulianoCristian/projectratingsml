the\n            Sustainability of the National System of Protected Areas\n            Project for Bolivia. Its development objective is to ensure\n            the sustainable management of the National System of\n            Protected Areas (SNAP) by establishing and strengthening: a)\n            legal, institutional, and policy frameworks; b) management\n            capacity at the protected area and central levels; and c)\n            SNAP finanacing mechanisms. Phase I will also identify the\n            gaps in representativity of Bolivian ecosystems within the\n            current protected areas, and propose adjustments to SNAP to\n            expand its coverage to all relevant ecosystems. There are\n            five project components. The first aims to strengthen the\n            regulatory agency's policy, planning, and management\n            capacities, and its ability to operate autonomously. The\n            second component aims to strenthen the planning and\n            managment capacities of the protected areas, and increase\n            local participation and inter-institutional coordination.\n            The third component prepares and approves the Protected\n            Areas law, and amends cross-sectoral laws and regulations.\n            The fourth component establishes and capitalizes a dedicated\n            trust fund to provide recurrent cost financing for protected\n            areas. The fifth component consolidates and complements\n            ongoing efforts in resource managmeent and monitoring in\n            protected areas and their buffer zones."}, "docdt": "2000-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
