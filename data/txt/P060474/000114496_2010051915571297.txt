timely and appropriate action satisfactory to Bolivia and the Bank to remedy the 
situation; 
(c)
FUNDESNAP By-laws, FUNDESNAP’s Charter, the FUNDESNAP Operational Manual, 
the Investment Strategy or the Asset Management Agreement shall have been amended,

SCHEDULE 2
Description of the Project
In order to contribute to the achievement of the CAS Strategic Objectives for 
Opportunity, the objective of the Project is to conserve Bolivia’s globally 
significant biodiversity through the sustainable management of SNAP.
The Project, which constitutes the first phase of the SNAP Program, consists of 
the following Parts, subject to such modifications thereof as Bolivia, FUNDESNAP and 
the Bank may agree upon from time to time to achieve such objectives:
Part A:
Institutional and Policy Development
Consolidation of SERNAP’s role as the regulatory agency of SNAP by strengthening 
of planning and management capacities and its ability to operate as an autonomous 
institution, through:
(a)
preparation of a long-term master plan that sets forth policies, 
strategies and priorities for the management of Protected Areas, and carrying out of:
Page  12
(i)
analysis of biodiversity gaps; and
(ii)
studies on re-categorization, boundary demarcation, abandonment 
and legal status of Protected Areas;
(b)
preparation of SERNAP’s strategic institutional and financial plan, 
including a medium-term financial strategy;
(c)
strengthening of SERNAP’s financial collection systems and revenue 
generation mechanisms;
(d)
institutional strengthening of SERNAP in the areas of planning, 
monitoring, evaluation and management; and
(e)

Part B:
Management of Selected Protected Areas
Strengthening of the planning and management capacities of Management Councils 
of Selected Protected Areas with enhanced participation of local communities in 
decision-making, through:

strengthening of the operational capacity of the Selected Protected 
Areas, including preparation and implementation of Management Plans, capacity-building 
and environmental education of neighboring communities; and
(b)
strengthening of local participation and inter-institutional coordination 
in the Selected Protected Areas, including the establishment and operation of the 
respective Management Councils.
Part C:
Legal and Regulatory Framework
Establishment of an adequate legal and regulatory framework for biodiversity 
conservation in Bolivia and management of SNAP, through:
(a)
preparation and dissemination of proposals for the Protected Areas 
Legislation;
(b)
review of cross-sectoral legislation, identification of gaps and 
inconsistencies, and preparation of amendment proposals; and
(c)
preparation of specific SNAP regulations, including zoning, environmental 
protection and services, tourism and related activities within Protected Areas.
Part D:
Sustainable Financing
Strengthening of SNAP through:
(a) 
establishment and capitalization of FUNDESNAP, aimed at financing the 
incremental recurrent costs of managing the Selected Protected Areas; and
(b) 
initial support to FUNDESNAP aimed at: 
(i)
consolidating the legal, financial and operational structure of 
FUNDESNAP;
(ii)
providing managerial and technical support to enable FUNDESNAP to 
assume its financial and administrative oversight responsibilities 
in connection with the FUNDESNAP GEF Trust Fund Grant; and
Page  13
(c)
long-term operation and administration of FUNDESNAP.
Part E:
Biodiversity Management and Monitoring in Selected Protected Areas
Consolidation of resource management and monitoring in Selected Protected Areas 
and their buffer zones, through:
(a)
development of specific models for biodiversity and natural resources 
management in Selected Protected Areas, including systematization of ongoing 
experiences, piloting and validating such models, and sharing their results; and
(b)
monitoring and evaluation of biodiversity conservation, including the 
design and implementation of a system that evaluates the efficiency of conservation 
programs in place and provides SERNAP with inputs for planning and decision-making.
