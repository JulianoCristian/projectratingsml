     medium scale industries (SMIs) whose financial viability is\n            currently being seriously undermined by the high inflation\n            environment and whose future prospects will be affected by\n            the increased competitive pressure following the\n            Government's recently introduced trade liberalization\n            measures. To that end, the project provides a broad range of\n            financial and technical assistance services to micro, small\n            and medium size industrial enterprises. More specifically,\n            it provides (a) medium to long-term credit to finance fixed\n            investment and working capital; (b) equity and quasi-equity\n            to finance fixed asset investment and working capital needs\n            of new or expansion projects; and (c) funds for\n            institutional and financial strengthening of Fondo Nacional\n            de Fomento Industrial (FOMIN) and commercial banks. The\n            project further provides (d) credit for construction of\n            industrial buildings by leaseholders in approved industrial\n            parks and the modernization/expansion of existing industrial\n            parks; (e) fixed asset and working capital subloans for\n            micro-enterprises in the informal sector; and (f) technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1987-06-02T00:00:00Z"}
