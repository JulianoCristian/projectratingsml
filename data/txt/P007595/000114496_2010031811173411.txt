                            SCHEDULE 7
                          Special Account
1.   For the purposes of this Schedule:
     (a)  the term "Categories" means  the  Categories of items to
be financed out of the proceeds of the loan set forth in the table
in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement;
     (b)  the term "eligible  expenditures"  means expenditures in
respect of the reasonable cost  of goods and services required for
carrying out the Project and to be financed out of the proceeds of
the  Loan  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of,  and  in the
precentages provided in, Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and
     (c)  the term "initial deposit" means an amount equivalent to
$15,000,000  to  be  withdrawn  from  the  Loan  Account  from the
Category or Categories determined  by the Bank, after consultation
with the Borrower, and  deposited  in the Special Account pursuant
to paragraph 3 of this Schedule.
2.   Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively
for eligible expenditures  in  accordance  with  the provisions of
this  Schedule.  The  Borrower  shall  make  withdrawals  from the
Special Account for payments  of  eligible operations on the basis
of the evidence that  the  Bank  shall have reasonably determined,
and shall debit the Special Account  with the amount in dollars so
withdrawn or with the dollar equivalent of the currency other than
dollars in which the payment was  made, determined on the basis of
the rate of  exchange  between  the  dollar  and  such currency in
effect: (i) on the date each  payment shall have been made, if the
payment has  taken  place  within  90  days  before  the  date the
withdrawal in question has been requested, provided, however, that
in respect of eligible expenditures under FOGAIN Sub-loans, FIDEIN
Loans, FOMIN Investment  and  Micro-Enterprise  Loans, such 90-day
Page  17
period shall  be  counted  as  from  the  date  on  which the Bank
dispatches its: (A)  approval  of  the  FOGAIN  Loan, FIDEIN Loan,
FOMIN Investment or Micro-Enterprise  Loan  out of the proceeds of
which the expenditure is to  be financed, and (B) authorization of
withdrawals from  the  Loan  Account  in  respect  of a free-limit
FOGAIN Sub-loan, or a free-limit FOMIN Investment, or a free-limit
Micro-Enterprise Loan out of the proceeds of which the expenditure
is to be financed; or (ii)  on the date each withdrawal shall have
been made.
3.   The Bank may, at  the  request  of  the Borrower, withdraw on
behalf of the Borrower from the  Loan Account and deposit into the
Special Account the initial deposit.  Thereafter, and on the basis
of  requests  by  the  Borrower  furnished  to  the  Bank  at such
intervals as the Bank  shall  specify,  the  Bank shall further so
withdraw from  the  Loan  Account  and  deposit  into  the Special
Account such amounts as shall be required to replenish the Special
Account for eligible expenditures, but only to the extent that the
amount of any such deposit,  together with any amount remaining on
deposit in the Special  Account  as  of  the date of such request,
shall not exceed, in the  aggregate, the equivalent of the initial
deposit.   Except  as  the  bank  may  otherwise  agree, each such
deposit after the initial deposit  shall  be withdrawn by the Bank
from the Loan Account under  the  respective Categories and in the
respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by the
evidence  supporting  the  request   for  such  deposit  furnished
pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Schedule.
4.   Prior to or at the time of each request by the Borrower for a
deposit by the Bank  into  the  Special  Account after the initial
deposit, the Borrower  shall  furnish  in  respect of each payment
made by the Borrower out of the Special Account such documents and
other evidence as the Bank  shall reasonably request, showing that
such payment was made for eligible expenditures.
5.   Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of   paragraph  3  of  this
Schedule, when the total unwithdrawn  amount of the Loan allocated
to the Categories,  minus  the  amount  of  any special commitment
entered into by the Bank  pursuant  to Section 5.02 of the General
Conditions,  then  still  outstanding,   shall  be  equal  to  the
equivalent of twice the  amount  of  the initial deposit, the Bank
shall be  entitled,  after  consultations  with  the  Borrower, to
reduce the percentage  of  disbursements for eligible expenditures
or take other action which will  ensure  the Bank that by the time
of disbursement of the total  amount  of the proceeds of the Loan,
all deposits (including the initial  deposit made by the Bank into
the Special Account) were made for eligible expenditures.
6.   (a)  If the Bank shall have  determined  at any time that any
payment out of the Special Account:  (i) was made for any expendi-
ture or in any amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this
Schedule, or (ii)  was  not  justified  by  the evidence furnished
pursuant to paragraph 4  of  this  Schedule, the Bank shall notify
the Borrower of  such  circumstances  and  if,  after  a period of
30 days from the issuance of  such  notice, an amount equal to the
amount of such  payment  or  portion  thereof  not  so eligible or
justified has not been  deposited  by  the Borrower in the Special
Account, or if the Bank  shall  so  request, refunded to the Bank,
the Bank may, without in any way restricting or limiting any other
rights, power or  remedy  of  the  Bank  under the Loan Agreement,
refrain from making further deposits into the Special Account.
     (b)  If the Bank shall have  determined  at any time that any
amount outstanding in the Special  Account will not be required to
cover further  payments  for  eligible  expenditures, the Borrower
shall, promptly upon notice  from  the  Bank, and unless otherwise
agreed  by  the  Bank,  refund   to  the  Bank  such  amount  then
outstanding in the Special Account.
