This\n            is a Level two restructuring of the Project. The\n            restructuring paper seeks the approval of the country\n            director to introduce changes to the project and\n            accompanying amendments to the project's legal\n            documents. The changes include: (i) a revision of project\n            components; (ii) a reallocation of the project grant\n            proceeds; and (iii) an extension of the closing date by 18\n            months, from November 15, 2012 to May 15, 2014. The main\n            reason for the change is to address the project\n            implementation lag and the resultant low disbursement rates\n            through a simplification of project design and a reduction\n            in scope. The original Project Development Objective (PDO)\n            will be maintained. Although the PDO level indicators will\n            be simplified and consolidated for more clarity as presented\n            below, their substance remains unchanged, thereby not\n            affecting achievement of PDO."}, "docdt": "2011-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
