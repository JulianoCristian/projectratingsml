Both the Bank and the\n            Borrower received moderately unsatisfactory performances as\n            well. One restructuring took place during this project and\n            includes the follows changes: a revision of project\n            components and indicators to compensate for project\n            implementation delays, an extension of the closing date by\n            eighteen months, and a reallocation of proceeds to align\n            project funding with redefined activities. Due to the\n            restructuring the PDO indicators were revised but there was\n            no change in the PDO itself. Component 2 of the project saw\n            a few changes as a result of the restructuring as well. The\n            number of CBCAs was reduced to three sites and funds were\n            increased to extend project support to fringe communities.\n            Lessons learned that were drawn and which could serve as\n            guidance for similar projects in the future include the\n            following: (1) The country\u0092s lengthy and bureaucratic nature\n            of the National Department of Public Procurement needs to be\n            taken into account when designing projects. (2) The\n            Project's PDO and indicators should be carefully\n            reviewed during project preparation. A strong results\n            framework including indicators that are realistic and\n            directly linked to the PDO is fundamental in achieving\n            envisaged project outcomes. (3) A strong M&E framework\n            including a dedicated M&E officer is of paramount\n            importance. (4) Government commitment at all levels is a\n            crucial factor in achieving the Project's envisaged\n            outcomes. The Bank should react promptly (i.e., revising the\n            PDO or closing the Project) to any indications of\n            diminishing commitment levels or other factors that indicate\n            envisaged project outcomes may not be achieved. (5)\n            Sufficient time needs to be allocated for stakeholder\n            consultations and negotiations associated with the\n            establishment of the CBCAs. (6) Financing mechanisms that\n            ensure project outcomes will be sustained beyond the\n            Project's lifetime are important to establish during\n            project implementation. (7) A regional approach to managing\n            coastal marine biodiversity should be fostered. (8) It is\n            important to carefully review the Project's last ISR to\n            avoid a possible disconnect with the ICR's rating. (9)\n            The ICR review meeting should be conducted as early as\n            possible to allow for sufficient time for revisions and\n            government consultation prior to its submission to the Board."}, "docdt": "2015-02-13T00:00:00Z"}
