                         resources through the establishment of viable community-based coastal zone management systems in biodiversity priority sites".

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR covers two implementation support missions held respectively in May and November 2012. Execution of project activities are on track as evidenced by the progress towards
                         achieving the two PDO-level indicators, i.e.: (i) Number of communal marine and coastal biodiversity sites, including wetlands areas demarcated and protected; and (ii) Number of the
                         inter-communal management councils participating in the conservation of marine and coastal resources, including mangrove conservation.

                         (i) for indicator one, all three communal marine and coastal biodiversity sites to be demarcated and protected by project end on May 15 2014, have legally been created by
                         communal arrete in line with the national legislation: (i) Vodounto in the Commune of Ouidah; (ii) Bamezoun in the Commune of Aguégués; and (iii) Togbin-Adounko in the
                         Commune of Abomey-calavi. The demarcation of these three conservation areas was done in a participatory manner involving communities living around the conservation areas,
                         who will ensure long term protection of these areas along with sites management units being set up in each of the communes by the project.

                         (ii) the second PDO-level indicator measured by two inter-communal management councils held on a yearly basis to identify issues and agree on actions to ensure long-term
                         management of the sites is also on track although, only one meeting has been held so far this year. The project team will work closely with the mayors to ensure that the second
                         meeting is held before end December 2012 and its outcomes circulated to the project team.
