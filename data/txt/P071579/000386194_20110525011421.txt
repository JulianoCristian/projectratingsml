                                RESTRUCTURING PAPER



SUMMARY
   1. This is a Level two restructuring of the Benin Community-Based Coastal and Marine
   Biodiversity Management Project (The Project). The Restructuring Paper seeks the
   approval of the Country Director to introduce changes to the Project and accompanying
   amendments to the Project’s legal documents. The changes include: (i) a revision of
   Project components; (ii) a reallocation of the Project Grant Proceeds; and (iii) an
   extension of the closing date by 18 months, from November 15, 2012 to May 15, 2014.

   2. The main reason for the proposed change is to address the project implementation lag
   and the resultant low disbursement rates through a simplification of project design and a
   reduction in scope.


PROJECT STATUS
   3. The project was approved on February 19, 2008 and became effective on October 14,
   2008. The GEF grant amount is US$4.30 million and the disbursed amount to date is
   0.75 million (17.4% disbursement rate). The effectiveness delays due to the lengthy
   parliamentary process for the Project’s ratification, and the slow national procurement
   processes have contributed to slow project implementation. During an implementation
   support and supervision mission held from October 5 to 17, 2009, the Bank team and the
   Beninese Authorities agreed to restructure the project as described above in order to
   increase the potential of achieving the PDO. The Government request letters are attached
   as Annex 5.

   4. After being rated Unsatisfactory (U) and Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU) in 2009,
   the project has been consistently rated “Moderately Satisfactory” (MS) since June 2010,
   in view of the progress in implementation measured by marginal improvements in project
   implementation and in disbursements which improved from 6.82% in 2009, and 8.28% in
   2010.

PROPOSED CHANGES
  Project Development Objective (PDO)

  5. The original PDO “Promote the participatory conservation and sustainable use of
  biological diversity of coastal wetlands and marine resources through the establishment
  of community-based conservation areas in high priority biodiversity sites” will be
  maintained. This PDO is still attainable. Although the PDO level indicators will be
  simplified and consolidated for more clarity as presented below, their substance remains
  unchanged, thereby not affecting achievement of PDO.

  Results/indicators

  6. The consolidated PDO level indicators are: (i) Number of communal marine and
  coastal biodiversity sites, including wetlands areas demarcated and protected; and (ii)
  Number of the inter-communal management councils participating in the conservation of
  marine and coastal resources, including mangrove conservation. The new results matrix
  and the corresponding realigned indicators are attached in Annex 1.

  Project Components

  7. The current four components: (i) Coordination, Institution and Capacity Building for
  Integrated Coastal Zone Management; (ii) Community-Based Coastal Biodiversity
  Conservation Areas; (iii) Monitoring and Evaluation of Coastal and Marine Biodiversity;
  and (iv) Project Management, will be maintained with readjustments within Components
  one and two which will not impact PDO attainment.

  8. Under Component one, the adoption of a framework law with the associated decrees
  and the creation of a national commission will be cancelled given the time it would take
  to get such an adoption to go through Parliament. Experience has shown that this can
  take upwards of two years or more to obtain. The project can still fundamentally achieve
  its objective even if the framework is not adopted. The project would still work with
  government around the principles that would have been formalized by the law, most
  specifically the participation of communities in protected areas management.
  Furthermore, the project will continue to follow up on the adoption of the national
  marine and coastal zone strategy by the Council of Ministers, which can be accomplished
  within the extension period.

  9. The scope of Component two will be reduced in terms of the number of sites to be
  upgraded to Community Based Conservation Areas (three are now targeted instead of
  four). But this component will extend support to additional rural populations, particularly
  the fringe communities, in order to increase natural resources management and
  conservation practices in the immediate vicinities of the targeted sites, thereby enhancing
  the sustainability of project interventions.

  10. The specifics of the changes in the components are presented in a matrix in Annex 2.


                                              6
Financing

11. Project costs have been revised as follows:

                                            Project Costs (US$m.)

Reallocations

12. The Government of Benin has requested a reallocation of GEF proceeds to align
project funding to the redefined activities. The reallocation includes the following
changes:

          i.    a decrease in “Works” category to limit infrastructure works to small scale
                buildings to house the project management units at the community level;

         ii.     a decrease in “Consultant Services” and “ Training” as their costs were
                overestimated at project inception; this cost saving will enable allocation of
                additional funds to micro-project Grants category as described below;

        iii.    an increased in the “Grants” category to extend alternative livelihoods
                activities to fringe communities;

        iv.     an increase in “Operating Costs” category to enhance the operating capacity
                of the Project Management Unit thereby ensuring a faster implementation
                pace.

13. The new reallocation table is presented below:

    If the project has had a previous restructuring, the current should reflect the latest approved costs.

Closing date

14. The Government has also requested an extension of the project closing date from
November 15, 2012 to May 15, 2014. This is the first extension for this project. The
extension is necessary to minimize the impact of the effectiveness delay and subsequent
implementation lag, thereby increasing the potential of achieving the PDO within the
extension period. The Government has prepared an action plan covering the extension
period which has been determined to be acceptable to the Bank. The action plan is
attached as Annex 3 and the related procurement plan as Annex 4.

15. There are no outstanding audit reports for this project.
