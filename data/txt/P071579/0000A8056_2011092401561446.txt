                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Government and the Bank agreed in May 2011 to restructure the project in order to accelerate project#s implementation. Project design was simplified and the scope of some of
                         the proposed project activities reduced. The project closing date has also been extended to May 15, 2014.
