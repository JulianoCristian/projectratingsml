1.        PROJECT CONTEXT, PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN

1.1       CONTEXT AT APPRAISAL
1.       Country and sector background: Benin’s coastal zone consists of a sea front 125 km long, and an
area stretching 50-60 km inland from the Atlantic Ocean that covers about eight percent of the country’s
land area, but harbors 50 percent of the population. At appraisal, the coastal zone was of great economic
importance to Benin as it contained most of the country’s economic infrastructure and contributed about 70
percent of its GDP.
2.       The ecological functions and the natural and biological processes that take place at the interface
between the rivers, lagoons, lakes and swamps, on the one hand, and the marine areas, on the other, make
the Benin coastal zone one of the most productive of the Gulf of Guinea. In particular, water bodies in the
coastal inland had a relatively high productivity in fisheries with yields averaging 1 ton/ha/year, compared
to 200-300 kg/ha/year for other West African lagoon systems. Overall, the coastal wetlands, swamps,
lagoons, lakes and rivers provided some 33,000 tons of fish, shrimps, and crabs (as opposed to 7,000 tons
from the sea) annually. Thus, fisheries played an important role in protein intake and food security, income
generation and employment. The coastal zone was also the provider of key agricultural products including
export crops such as pineapples, palm oil, and banana. A large number of local food products and non-food
products that are collected from wetlands and other permanent and seasonal water bodies played important
roles in home consumption and income generation for rural households, especially the poor.
3.       The coastal zone of Benin also harbors globally important and unique biodiversity assets. The
variety of geological, topographic, and hydrological conditions of the coastal zone combined to create a
diversity of ecosystems and habitats for rare animal species. Wetlands, lagoons, and rivers cover 40 percent
of Benin coastal zone, and these water bodies encompass eight different ecosystems that provide
irreplaceable ecological functions, and breeding, feeding and nurturing grounds for fish and other aquatic
organisms.
4.       However, high population density (340 inhabitants per square kilometer in the coastal zone,
compared to the national average of 75 per square kilometer) and the concentration of economic activities
in the coastal zone, many of which rely heavily on the exploitation of natural resources, have resulted in an
array of environmental problems. The key threats to the coastal zone resources included:

         Lack of clarity in the distribution of powers and rights between the central and local governments
          leads to centralized top-down approaches and weak incentives for resource stewardship and lack
          of investments in environmental protection by the municipalities and local communities;

         Weak technical capacity of municipalities and local communities for integrated resource
          management and planning hinders the integration of environmental concerns into local
          development plans;
         Lack of effective mechanisms to coordinate activities and establish consultation among various
          institutions whose activities have direct impacts on coastal ecosystems;




                                                      1
         Deforestation and removal of vegetative cover (due to high demand for firewood, agricultural land,
          and construction materials) leading to increased soil erosion, sedimentation of coastal rivers and
          lakes, fragmentation and loss of habitat;
         Soil and water (lakes, river, sea) pollution by industrial and household wastes; and
         Weak enforcement of environmental regulations and property rights over resources leading to
          unsustainable exploitation of natural resources (e.g. over-fishing, uncontrolled sand mining on
          seashore for construction, illegal dumping of hazardous wastes, poaching, conversion of river banks
          and wetlands to agriculture, etc.).
5.       These environmental threats, on the one hand, and the critical human, natural and economic assets
on the other, made the protection of the production potential and the sustainable management of the coastal
zone resources a key priority for the Government. Integrated coastal management was one of the seven sub-
programs of Benin’s National Environmental Management Program. In addition, the National Biodiversity
Strategy and Action Plan published in 2002 emphasized the need to protect biodiversity hotspots in the
coastal zone by mainstreaming biodiversity conservation into sectoral policies. This led to the establishment
of the two Ramsar sites,2 in which the community-based conservation areas of this project are located.3
6.      Rationale for Bank involvement: The objective of this project was fully consistent with the GEF
Biodiversity Strategy and Operational Program 2 for Coastal, Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems. The
Project was also consistent with Benin’s 2007 Poverty Reduction Strategy4 and the World Bank’s Country
Assistance Strategy for FY04-07 for Benin5 in its support to decentralized and community-based
development. Though there were a few other donors involved in natural resource management in the coastal
zone, only the Bank dealt with biodiversity conservation at the time. 6 Overall, the Project intended to
complement and add value to the Bank’s previous and ongoing strategic and operational environmental
dialogue with the Government in Benin.7 The Bank’s involvement in the environmental sector, and the
experience and benefits of programmatic support to the ministry of environment, housing and urban affairs
(Ministère de l’Environnement, de l’Habitat et de l’Urbanisme – MEHU), and the Benin environment
agency (Agence Béninoise pour l’Environnement – ABE) gave the Bank a comparative advantage in
helping ensure the achievement and sustainability of the objectives of the Project.
7.        Higher-level objectives: The long-term goal of the country’s National Environmental Management
Program was to help reduce poverty while protecting the natural resource base, which was considered a
critical factor for the economic activities of the majority of the population. By developing and promoting a

fundamental ecological functions of wetlands and their economic, cultural, scientific, and recreational value. The Ramsar List of
Wetlands of International Importance now includes over 2,000 Sites (known as Ramsar Sites) covering over 200,000,000 ha
(490,000,000 acres).

Benin through the Environmental Management project, which had closed in 2001.

                                                                 2
viable system of community-based biodiversity conservation that contributes to the sustainable
management of economically vital resources of Benin’s coastal zone, the Project was expected to help
control the driving forces behind the over-exploitation and degradation of biodiversity resources and
balance livelihood needs with protection of the resource base in a sustainable manner.

1.2      ORIGINAL GEO, PDO, AND KEY INDICATORS
8.      Original Global Environment Objective (GEO) as presented in the Project Appraisal Document
(PAD):8 To promote the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity of coastal wetlands and
marine resources, while supporting the livelihood and economic opportunities of the local communities
living near and around the conservation areas.
9.      Original Project Development Objective (PDO) as presented in the PAD:9 To promote the
participatory conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity of coastal wetlands and marine
resources through establishment of viable community-based coastal zone management systems in
biodiversity priority sites.
10.     Original PDO indicators as presented in the PAD:10 (i) 100% of the four Community-Based
Biodiversity Conservation Areas (CBCAs) are managed by local communities according to agreed
principles by year 5; (ii) 70% of the activities of management plans of each one of the four community-
based biodiversity conservation areas are implemented by year 5; and (iii) 50% average increase in the
management effectiveness score of the four community-based biodiversity conservation areas by year 5
compared to site-specific baseline assessment.

1.3      REVISED GEO, PDO AND KEY INDICATORS
11.     The PDO indicators were revised through a Level II restructuring on May 17, 2011. The PDO itself
was not revised as it was still considered attainable.
12.      Revised PDO indicators as presented in the restructuring paper:11 (i) Number of communal
marine and coastal biodiversity sites, including wetlands areas demarcated and protected; (ii) number of
the inter-communal management councils participating in the conservation of marine and coastal resources,
including mangrove conservation.

41053-BJ), January 18, 2008.
9 The original PDO that was stated in the Global Environment Facility Grant Agreement minimally differed from the one stated in

the PAD. The PDO stated in the Grant Agreement was: To promote the participatory conservation and sustainable use of biological
diversity of coastal wetlands and marine resources through the establishment of community-based conservation areas in high
priority biodiversity sites.
10 The original PDO indicators that were stated in the Global Environment Facility Grant Agreement minimally differed from the

one stated in the PAD. The PDO indicators stated in the Grant Agreement were: (i) The four CBCAs are managed by local
communities in accordance with the Biodiversity Conservation Charter signed with the local authorities at the beginning of the
Project; (ii) 70% of conservation and sustainable use activities included in the four CBCA Management Plans are successfully
implemented by year 5; and (iii) 50% increase in the management effectiveness score of the four targeted CBCAs by year 5
compared to site-specific baseline assessment.

(see data sheet of this document).

1.4     MAIN BENEFICIARIES
14.      Beneficiaries: Primary project beneficiaries were intended to be local communities, particularly
those living in and around the four CBCAs of the two Ramsar sites. The communities were expected to
benefit from sustainable flows of natural products and services to meet their livelihood needs, while the
long-term protection and maintenance of biodiversity and natural habitat was being promoted. Project
beneficiaries including line ministers, coastal municipalities, and the Benin environment agency, were
additionally expected to benefit from an enabling environment for integrated coastal zone management,
and coastal biodiversity conservation. A deteriorating coastal and marine biodiversity affects global
communities of people, species, and ecosystems in general. The protection and management of coastal
biodiversity resources – a global public good - was expected to generate global environmental benefits.

1.5     ORIGINAL AND REVISED COMPONENTS
15.     The PDO was to be achieved through the implementation of four interrelated components (outlined
in Table 1). The table also shows revisions made through a Level II restructuring on May 17, 2011, which
became necessary following substantial project implementation delays.

2.        KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

2.1       PROJECT PREPARATION, DESIGN AND QUALITY AT ENTRY
16.     The Project was prepared between 2001 and 2008. Project preparation was lengthy because of the
following reasons: (i) a change in Bank instruments which required assistance to be delivered through
budget support and was considered too risky;12 and (ii) municipal elections during preparation which
required renegotiating how to best secure land for biodiversity conservation in the municipalities with a
subsequent delay in preparing the social safeguard documents.13
17.     Soundness of the background analysis: Project preparation was lengthy but at the same time
comprehensive and well researched. Several studies14 were conducted during the Project’s PDF-B phase to
inform the initial selection of potential CBCAs, before the Tracking Tools for GEF Biodiversity Focal Area
SP1 and SP2 were used to prepare baseline assessments for these sites. The STAP Roster Review was
supportive of the Project, and confirmed that there was sufficient ecological and technical information
available to give the Project a reasonably sound scientific base. In addition, the Project was designed in a
highly participatory manner, involving the local population and authorities. The approach was based on the
different stakeholders’ roles in the exploitation or control of wetlands and coastal resources before and
during project implementation. The participatory approach allowed exploring the interests, views, and
expectations of each stakeholders group.15
18.      The Benin Environment Agency (Agence Béninoise pour l’Environnement – ABE) was adequately
chosen as implementation agency based on its experience and information available at the time. ABE had
been the implementing agency for the IDA-financed environmental management project, which had closed
in 2001, and was therefore considered familiar with the World Bank’s environmental and social safeguard
policies. The agency was also considered suitable, having developed reliable capacity in environmental
assessment, and being experienced in conducting capacity building activities. A procurement capacity
assessment conducted in 2004 accurately highlighted several weaknesses and the probable inexperience in
procurement of most of the micro-project grant recipients, and rated the overall project risk for procurement

12 Starting 2002, the Government of Benin and the Bank adopted a programmatic approach focusing mainly on public finance and
expenditure management. Under the new approach nearly all Bank assistance had to be delivered through budget support. Given
the lack of traceability of the GEF incremental resources (if mixed with the country’s own budgetary resources), and the weakness
of the country’s public financial system, the potential fiduciary risks were deemed too high for the task team. Only in 2004, more
flexibility was introduced to the choices of lending instruments for Benin.
13 The initial project proposal was based on land acquisition through purchase. Substantial efforts went into negotiating modalities

during and after the preparation phase (PDF-B activities). The agreement reached at the time of the PDF-B proposal was later
modified by the Government after municipal elections and the installation of the first elected local government in over two decades
at the time. A resulting lack of clarity in the sharing of ownership rights between the central and local governments led the Project
preparation team to renegotiate land acquisition modalities. The new negotiations were subsequently disrupted by new legislative
and presidential elections, which eventually substantially delayed the preparation, review, adoption, and disclosure of the social
safeguard documents.
14 The studies included one on the feasibility of the suggested conservation sites and one on threatened species. Furthermore, an

analysis of land tenure constraints was conducted.
15 A two-step consultation process was adopted in order to ensure effective participation. The first phase consisted of organizing

separate discussions evolved around the needs of each category of stakeholders (resource users, community leaders, public
administrators, etc.), whereas the second step consisted in organizing a workshop where information on the Project objectives and
planned activities is shared with all the stakeholders.

                                                                 7
as high.16 Measures to strengthen procurement capacity were subsequently included as conditions of
negotiations and effectiveness. A financial management assessment considered ABE as adequately
equipped, with the overall control risk for Bank-funded projects rated as moderate.17
19.      Assessment of project design: The Project was carefully designed, including consideration of two
alternative approaches.18 The design was comprehensive in its approach, as it targeted coastal biodiversity
conservation at the national and local level. It aimed to create an enabling environment for integrated coastal
zone management and coastal biodiversity conservation through enactment of new regulations, effective
coordination mechanisms, and capacity building, as well as to support coastal biodiversity conservation
through the creation of CBCAs.
20.      However, shortcomings included an insufficient focus on the regulatory instruments that were
intended to strengthen the policy and legal framework at the national level. 19 The enactment and
enforcement of the envisaged regulatory instruments was not anchored in the Project’s PDO indicators,
even though these legal regulations were fundamental in creating an enabling environment for integrated
coastal zone management and coastal biodiversity conservation at the national level, and ensuring the
sustainability of the CBCAs in the long-term. In addition, the design had underestimated the time needed
for the numerous project activities, particularly for consultations and negotiations with stakeholders. Plans
expecting the CBCAs to be created within 18 months of project effectiveness were hampered by lengthy
consultations and negotiations with the relevant communities and authorities, and were thus significantly
delayed. Disbursements were subsequently slow as most project investments were tied to the creation of
the CBCAs.
21.     Adequacy of government commitment: Government commitment was adequate. Prior to project
preparation, Benin had ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity on June 30, 1994, and signed the
Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance on November 24, 2000. Since 2002,
investments related to the sustainable management of the coastal zone had been included in the program
budgets and the medium-term expenditure framework of the Ministry of Environment.20 The Government
had invested about US$2.2 million in integrated coastal zone management (coastal erosion, demand-based
community investments in income generating activities, ecotourism promotion, and training).
22.       Assessment of risks: A number of crucial risks were identified and included (i) decentralization
efforts being inadequate to clarify distribution of powers and rights between central and local governments;
(ii) increased land scarcity and rising population pressure in project areas undermining the effectiveness of

16 A procurement capacity assessment was conducted in March 2004 by a Benin country office procurement specialist.
17 A financial management assessment was carried out jointly by a World Bank financial management specialist and the ABE
financial specialist.
18 The first alternative aimed to integrate both the financing and the activities of the Project into the series of Benin’s Pove rty

Reduction Strategy Credits; however, insufficient assurance that ex-ante agreements on the adequate level of ABE’s budgetary
appropriations would be executed led to its abandonment. The second alternative considered creating fully protected conservation
areas in the coastal wetlands and marine ecosystems, however, high population density and competition for resources would have
made such an approach unattractive in the southern wetland and coastal areas. Consequently it was rejected.
19 The regulatory instruments included the national strategy for the management of wetlands, the coastal zone master plan, the

National Commission for Coastal Zone Protection and Management (NCCZPM), and the coastal zone framework.
20 Expenditures consisted of engineering and feasibility studies for the control of coastal erosion, the financing of local

environmental management plans for municipalities, enforcement and compliance activities, and thematic studies.

                                                                 8
collaborative conservation efforts; (iii) not sustaining political and budgetary commitment of the
Government and ministry to the Project and design; (iv) inability to recruit and retain qualified staff at the
national level; and (v) slow pace of formulation and implementation of management plans due to weak
technical and organizational capacity at the local level. However, while the anticipated risks were
adequately identified, their relevance was largely underestimated by considering the overall risk as
moderate. Risk mitigation measures should have been more comprehensive taking into account that the
lack of government commitment together with lengthy governmental authorization and adoption processes
substantially affected project implementation.

2.2       IMPLEMENTATION
23.     The Project was approved by the World Bank Board of Executive Directors on February 19, 2008,
and became effective on October 14, 2008. The Project was implemented by the Benin Environment
Agency (Agence Béninoise pour l’Environnement – ABE), which was under the Ministry of Environment
and Protection of Nature (MEPN). During the first three years of implementation, the Project experienced
long delays and periodic standstill in activities, eventually resulting in a Level II restructuring in 2011,
including an extension of the closing date for a total of 18 months.21 Following the restructuring, project
performance improved substantially. Key factors affecting implementation and outcomes particularly
during the first three years included:
         Insufficient government support: First, the Government’s performance was very slow towards
          meeting the Project’s effectiveness conditions. Ultimately, the Project became effective eight
          months after approval. In addition, the Project’s legal covenants were only partially complied with
          by the original dates set in the grant agreement. Second, none of the regulatory instruments,22 which
          would have allowed the implementing agency to work more effectively with the municipalities and
          local communities in the targeted areas, was adopted or enacted by the Government. Originally,
          these instruments had been planned to be adopted during project negotiations as they had already
          been presented to the country’s national assembly in 2007. When they still had not been adopted
          by the time the Project became effective, the Government had promised their adoption by June
          2009, and finally December 2009. However, except for the national strategy on wetlands
          management, which was revised and reintroduced for adoption, none of the instruments was
          adopted by project closure. Third, the continuously declining counterpart funding in line with low
          project disbursements affected project implementation as much as the national budget, which was
          not maintained at the level agreed in the grant agreement to ensure sufficient funding of baseline
          activities. Field missions which under the grant agreement were to be supported by counterpart
          funding could not be conducted to the extent that was originally planned.

         Ineffective institutional arrangements: First, a turnover in key senior staff accompanied by vacant
          positions in the beginning of project implementation contributed to the Project’s delayed


21 Note that the original closing date was 06/30/2013. At restructuring, it was assumed the Project would close on 11/15/2012, and
thus it was extended by 18 months to 05/15/2014.
22 These included adoption, enactment, and implementation of (i) the coastal zone framework law; (ii) the coastal zone master plan;

(iii) the national strategy for wetlands management; and (iii) National Commission for Coastal Zone Protection and Management
(NCCZPM).

                                                                9
          effectiveness and affected the launch of project activities. Newly recruited staff subsequently
          lacked technical expertise, which resulted in continued project implementation delays.23 Second, a
          high turnover in the Project Coordinator’s position together with temporary acting appointments
          (while the position was officially vacant) continuously affected internal collaboration.24 The Project
          Coordinator role was performed by the agency’s director before it was informally/temporarily
          passed on to two subsequent technical directors. Associated communication, collaboration, and
          interpersonal issues slowed project activities down, until in 2011 the director of the agency at the
          time assumed the role of Project Coordinator and project activities picked up. Two months before
          project closing the Project Coordinator was replaced again. Third, the lengthy and bureaucratic
          nature of the National Department of Public Procurement significantly slowed down approval and
          administrative procedures, and thus hampered implementation including disbursements.

         Ambitious nature of project activities and an underestimation of time needed for consultations
          and negotiations: The adoption of the coastal zone master plan, and the coastal zone framework
          law together with preparing and adopting the required implementation decrees turned out to be
          more difficult than originally estimated, because of lengthy internal adoption processes together
          with a lack of governmental support. In addition, consultations and negotiations with local
          communities and authorities associated with creating the CBCAs turned out to be more complicated
          and difficult than envisaged. Disbursements were subsequently slow as most project investments
          were tied to the creation of the CBCAs. The World Bank finally recommended revising the
          Project’s components and indicators to focus the Project on achievable activities (i.e., focusing only
          on three instead of four conservation areas and dropping the adoption of the coastal zone framework
          law). The Level II restructuring in 2011 further included the reallocation of funds and an extension
          of the closing date. The changes introduced through the restructuring eventually improved project
          performance substantially.

2.3       M&E DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND UTILIZATION
24.      M&E design: The Project’s M&E system was comprehensive, and its importance was strengthened
by the fact that its aspects were included in the Project’s component 3 and 4. However, the Project’s results
framework should have been more concise and the indicators should have been less in number and better
aligned with the PDO. For data collection, the Project aimed to upgrade ABE’s environmental information
and monitoring system by including a coastal and marine biodiversity related database, and to link the
database to the Project’s M&E system. Furthermore, focus was placed on acquiring and installing new
hardware and software, establishing and implementing a participatory M&E plan, collecting data to
establish the baseline situation of the Project areas, carrying out periodic studies and data collection to
monitor and evaluate project performance, and preparing, and implementing an M&E capacity
strengthening plan adapted to the needs of participating actors.


23The  Project’s implementation agency’s director and senior staff that had played a key role in preparing the Project had left the
agency by the time the Project was launched. Subsequent staff lacked technical expertise, which resulted in lengthy preparations
of TORs for the consultation activities that aimed to secure the informed participation of local governments and populations. In
addition, the procurement specialist executed the Project’s procurement and M&E, which led to excessive labor.
24 Five different project coordinators led the implementation agency’s team during project implementation.



                                                                10
25.      M&E implementation and utilization: Until 2012, neither an M&E system nor an M&E system
linked to a financial management system had been put in place, which would have allowed ABE to
effectively assess implementation progress and to monitor activities against disbursements as envisaged in
the PAD. With the modifications introduced during the Project’s restructuring together with the eventual
establishment of an M&E system, the monitoring and reporting improved. The simplification of the
Project’s indicators facilitated easier reporting and monitoring, and a newly designated and subsequently
trained M&E officer closely followed project activities and reported against the Project’s indicators.
However, the Project’s revised indicators could have been better linked to the PDO. The Project’s indicators
were measuring outputs rather than project outcomes and the sustainability of project activities. Also, the
separate database that was put in place to monitor and evaluate coastal and marine biodiversity indicators,
and which was to be linked to the Project’s M&E system, was not fully operational at project closure. Field
missions aimed at monitoring project activities at the ground were not conducted to the extent originally
envisaged due to the lack in counterpart funding.

2.4       SAFEGUARD AND FIDUCIARY COMPLIANCE
26.      Safeguard compliance: The Project was a category B project (partial assessment), and triggered
two safeguard policies: OP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment and OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement.
The potential environmental effects associated with the planned operations were related to the second
component of the Project, the creation of the CBCAs. During project preparation, ABE prepared two
safeguards documents to the Bank’s satisfaction: (i) an Environmental and Social Management Framework
(ESMF), which provided guidance on the selection and implementation of income-generating micro-
activities that the Project intended to support as part of the conservation management plan of each CBCA;25
and a Resettlement Process Framework (RPF), which intended to ensure that the community members (who
would be adversely affected by the Project) were effectively compensated for losses of consumption and
income attributable directly to the Project.26
27.     Except for the first two years, which were characterized by substantial delays and a lack of
specialized staff, safeguard compliance performance was adequate and ABE was sufficiently staffed with
two to four specialists responsible for safeguard compliance. Implementation details are provided as
follows:
28.     The Project complied with OP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment: With regard to the creation of
the CBCAs, key local actors (e.g., village representatives, local appointees, communal organizations,
religious leaders, and local development associations) were familiarized with the content and
recommendations of the Project’s two safeguard documents through a series of sensitization activities
conducted in 2010.27 Furthermore, capacity building of community stakeholders in biodiversity

25 The ESMF defined standards methods and procedures that specified how sub-projects whose location, size, and nature were not
known at that time would address environmental and social issues.
26 The RPF described: (i) the Project activities that could have imposed restriction on natural resource use and the process by which

the affected people participated in the design of the Project; (ii) the criteria for eligibility of the affected people; (iii) the measures
to assist these people; (iv) the process for resolving potential conflicts in affected communities; (v) the administrative and legal
procedures applicable; and (vi) the monitoring arrangements to ensure the effectiveness of compliance with the above measures.
27 Sensitization activities included: (i) four sessions conducted between January and May 2010 in the Bemba and de Hio

communities; (ii) nine sessions conducted during the same period in the Mangrove de Houeke community.

                                                                   11
management was promoted; functional eco-guards were put in place for monitoring the CBCAs; to track
and monitor progress towards the protected area management effectiveness, trainings in how to use
Management Effectiveness Tracking Tools (METT) were held; and income-generating activity
beneficiaries were trained in adopting environment- and biodiversity-friendly practices (e.g., composting,
organic fertilizing).
29.     With regard to the implementation of income-generating activities and micro-projects for
communities adjacent to the three community-based marine protected areas created by the Project, an
environmental screening for potential adverse environmental and social aspects was conducted by ABE in
line with the ESMF. The screening covered 16 micro-projects and 81 income-generating activities in the
three CBCAs, and categorized them by required safeguard measures.28 Environmental and Social Impact
Assessments (ESIAs) required for 23 income-generating activities and three micro-projects were
subsequently conducted and validated along recommendations provided in the ESMF, as were all other
recommended safeguard measures. However, certain micro-projects were implemented without an official
land certificate in place, hence potentially creating social and unsustainability issues. Assurance was given
by the authorities to resolve these land tenure issues as a post-completion activity.
30.     OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement: The Project did not include land acquisitions and/or
involuntary resettlement. The policy was triggered to monitor the impact of access restrictions (i.e.,
potential economic losses) on people deriving their livelihoods from the natural resources that were subject
to conservation under the Project. Measures to protect the affected population’s interests were adequately
implemented: (i) awareness raising and sensitization activities were conducted;29 (ii) stakeholder
participation was promoted; and (iii) income-generating activities and micro-projects were promoted.
31.      Financial Management compliance: Financial management compliance was cumbersome during
the first two years of project implementation. Mainly due to the early departure of ABE’s chief financial
officer30 and the delayed recruitment of his replacement, the first two years were characterized by delayed
and poor quality interim financial reports, limited movements in the designated account, and delays in
recruiting an external auditor.31 There was also non-compliance with a dated covenant related to the
recruitment of an internal auditor for ABE, which was only corrected in 2012 32. Finally, there was low
mobilization of counterpart funds which continued until project closure. 33


28 The screening differentiated three categories of income-generating activities and micro-projects: (i) those not eligible for
financing; (ii) those requiring an ESIA; and (iii) those not requiring an ESIA but where environmental safeguard measures were
directly integrated in their implementation.
29 108 awareness raising activities were organized; and 623 community members were trained in community-based coastal and

marine biodiversity protection.
30 The head of the financial management department left the implementing agency ABE in February 2009.

31 An external auditor was only recruited beginning 2010.

32 One of the covenants of the grant was that within 12 months of project effectiveness, the recipient should have established an

internal auditing function within ABE.
33 As per the covenants of the grant (outlined in the PAD), the Government was supposed to deposit CFA 200 million in the

Project’s account within 10 months of project effectiveness, and continue to deposit CFA 100 million every six month till project
closure; as well as maintain at least the same level of budgetary allocations to ABE for the implementation of the national program
for environmental management (Programme National de Gestion de l’Environnement). The Government did not comply with either
of these legal covenants. The Government only once deposited CFA 200 million at the beginning of project implementation, before

                                                                12
32.      Financial management performance improved following project restructuring, and was rated at
satisfactory levels during the last two years of implementation: i) ABE was adequately staffed with regard
to financial management; ii) a new accounting software was set up; iii) the disbursement rate had
significantly improved to around 100 percent; iv) the interim financial reports were submitted on time with
acceptable quality; and v) external annual audit reports were submitted on time with unqualified opinions
and there were no open accountability issues at project closure.
33.      Procurement: Procurement activities were on average rated moderately satisfactory. Procurement
was often delayed, slowing down implementation and disbursements. Lengthy authorization processes at
the national procurement agency mainly caused these delays as procurement documents containing requests
were often delayed by several months. Approval times were slightly reduced during the last two years of
project implementation.34 Occasional communication issues between the procurement and technical staff
at ABE contributed to these delays, albeit to a lesser extent. 35
34.     ABE was adequately staffed throughout project implementation except for the fact that the
procurement specialist was temporarily responsible for project M&E in addition to his procurement
responsibilities. However, in January 2013, a new procurement officer, who was unfamiliar with World
Bank procurement guidelines, was appointed by the Government without the World Bank’s endorsement.
Training was offered by the World Bank, but not completed by the officer. Delivery of works, equipment
and services was subsequently occasionally delayed including shortly before project closure. Even though,
ABE put in place an action plan to ensure full execution of the remaining activities prior to project closure,
a post procurement review conducted before project closure showed that procurement activities have not
been conducted in line with World Bank procurement procedures.36

2.5       POST-COMPLETION OPERATION/NEXT PHASE
35.      The Government provided the assurance that it will carefully monitor the continuation of project
activities to ensure the Project outcomes will fully unfold and be sustained in the long-term. To continue
strengthening the three CBCAs in their aim to protect and maintain biodiversity and natural habitat, ABE
and the Government will:
      (i) Adopt, enact, and implement the coastal zone framework law; and implement the national coastal
          and marine biodiversity management strategy;
      (ii) Confirm the three CBCAs juridical status by obtaining the president’s signature for the associated
           decrees that were approved by the Council of Ministers on October 21, 2013; and distribute the
           decrees among all relevant stakeholders to maximize awareness.



the Government’s contribution declined. Furthermore, ABE’s budgetary allocations were reduced on a yearly basis throughout
project implementation, however, this less affected project implementation.
34 These delays were limited to contracts and purchases of more than 10 million CFA francs.

35 In 2012, procurement was rated moderately satisfactory due to ineffective communication between the procurement and technical

staff, resulting in slow collection of procurement inputs such as TORs.
36 The Project’s procurement plan was implemented including activities not planned for in the procurement plan approved by the

Bank, and the single source selection method was used without the clearance of the Bank (all single source selection methods
should be submitted for World Bank review).

                                                              13
      (iii) Finalize the inter-communal management councils’ (Conseil Intercommunal d’Ecodéveloppement
            – CIEDs) recognition as public institution through government adoption to ensure they have
            sustainable access to financing.37 Ensure the CBCAs management plans are adopted by the
            communities38 and the CIEDs, and integrated in the communities’ development plans. Continue to
            train stakeholders particularly those directly involved in the management of the CBCAs. Take over
            the function of the technical working group to continue the provision of technical support to the
            communities managing the CBCAs.
      (iv) Continue supporting the community members who benefitted from the Project’s income-generating
           activities through training, and monitoring. Particular focus will need to be given to financial
           management, as the knowledge on operating costs or adequate accounting for sustainable
           management of activities is still weak.
      (v) Collect the remaining baseline data that is necessary for the coastal and marine biodiversity
          database to be fully operational, and start monitoring changes in status and trends in environmental
          health and ecological stability of biodiversity of the coastal zone by effectively using the
          biodiversity monitoring and evaluation system.


3.        ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

3.1       RELEVANCE OF OBJECTIVES, DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION
36.     Relevance – Rating Substantial: The Project’s objectives continue to be considered relevant to
Benin’s national priorities. As evident from the country’s current poverty reduction strategy, managing of
the environment and natural resources in combination with improving living conditions and fostering
environmental governance is highlighted as one of the country’s priorities.39 Specifically, the Government
focuses on promoting environmental best practices, promoting integrated management of the living
environment, and rational management of forests and natural resources. Project objectives are also
consistent with the World Bank’s country partnership strategy, which promotes the sustainable management
of natural resources under one of the strategy’s main pillars;40 and the World Bank’s environment strategy,41
which notes the importance of protecting biodiversity by particularly referencing the protection of coastal
and marine areas and integrated coastal and marine ecosystem management.
37.      The numerous original project activities were ambitious, but the Project’s original and revised
design remains relevant (see Section 2.1 for details). However, as a consequence of project restructuring
including the elimination of the adoption and enactment of the coastal zone framework law, the Project lost
its broader national relevance, and mainly focused on the local level.

37 The CIED Lagunes Côtières has almost finalized the adoption process. The prefect amended the decree, and the CIED held a
meeting to incorporate comments; the Project is expected to be introduced to the Government for adoption in the coming months.
The CIED Nokoué, however, has not started the adoption process.

3.2       ACHIEVEMENT OF GEO AND PDO
38.      The Project's GEO and PDO were not revised; however, the PDO indicators and intermediate
outcome indicators were revised in May 2011. Therefore, the Project has been evaluated against its original
and revised PDO indicators and intermediate result indicators by measuring achievements at the time of
project closing (May 2014). A weighted average rating is provided at the end of this section.
39.      The GEO and PDO were similar in substance but varied slightly. Even though the Project’s grant
agreement and implementation documents (i.e., aide-memoires) were based on the PDO, the following
evaluation assesses the GEO and PDO together. The first section evaluates the common target of promoting
the participatory conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity of coastal wetlands and marine
resources, while the second part evaluates the establishment of CBCAs envisaged under the PDO, and the
support provided to the livelihood and economic opportunities of the local communities as envisaged under
the GEO.
40.      The Project helped to promote the participatory conservation and sustainable use of biological
diversity of coastal wetlands and marine resources, by supporting the creation of an enabling
environment for integrated management of the coastal zone resources. Activities included (i) the adoption
of a national coastal and marine biodiversity management strategy; (ii) the establishment of effective
participatory communal and inter-communal councils; (iii) the preparation of local and inter-communal
environmental management plans; and (iv) capacity building at the central level.
         Due to a lack of government commitment coupled with lengthy adoption processes, the enactment
          and enforcement of the envisaged regulatory instruments including the coastal zone framework law
          (Original Intermediate Result Indicator #4 – 0 percent), the national Inter-Sectorial Commission
          (ISC) and subsequent National Commission for Coastal Zone Protection and Management
          (NCCZPM) (Original Intermediate Result Indicator #1 – 0 percent), and the coastal zone master
          plan, were not achieved. Nevertheless, the Project successfully supported the adoption of a national
          coastal and marine biodiversity management strategy in October 2013 by decree. Equally adopted
          by decree were plans outlining the creation and responsibilities of the administrative bodies of the
          Government that will be responsible for the strategy’s implementation over the coming years.42
          Even though some of the strategy’s activities were already initiated during the strategy’s revision
          and adoption process (i.e., reforestation of degraded areas, establishment of security guards), the
          strategy’s implementation has, however, not officially started (Revised Intermediate Result
          Indicator #3 – 50 percent).

         Two communal councils were created in 201043 to coordinate economic development and the
          management of critical natural resources in communal territories, and areas that span over several
          municipalities. The two CCEDs met regularly with their first meetings having taken place in May
          and June 2010, respectively. In addition, two inter-communal councils for eco-development were


42 The national coastal and marine biodiversity management strategy was adopted by decree on October 21, 2013 (affaire 138/14
du 21 octobre 2013 relative au projet de décret portant SNGZH du Benin). Also adopted by decree on October 21, 2013 was a
mechanism dedicated to implement the Ramsar convention (affaire 117/14 du 21 octobre 2013 relative au projet de décret portant
création, attributions, organisation et fonctionnement des organes de mise en œuvre de la convention Ramsar au Benin).
43 The Conseil Communal d’Ecodéveloppement - CCED for Aguégués and the CCED for Sèmè-Podji



                                                             15
          created in 2010 (Revised PDO Indicator #2 – 66.6 percent);44 and their constitutions were prepared
          and adopted in December 2010 (Revised Intermediate Result Indicator #5 – 100 percent). Both
          CIEDs have since been operational, and each CIED met six times during project implementation
          to discuss the conservation of marine and coastal resources at the CBCAs. The two inter-communal
          councils for development (CIEDs) have become effective mechanisms in coordinating the
          management of natural resources as has been evident from their efforts in building partnerships and
          resource mobilization. With financial support from the ‘Parc Naturel Régional de la Narbonnaise’
          in France, the CIED Lagunes Côtières is currently implementing a water access program, while the
          CIED Nokoué is implementing a project focusing on integrated water resource management in
          collaboration with the national partnership for water (Partenariat National de l’Eau). To ensure the
          CIEDs access to public funds and thus their financial support in the long-term, they are currently
          in the process of becoming recognized as public institutions for inter-communal cooperation. 45

         Local plans for environmental management (Plan Local d’Aménagement et de Gestion de
          l’Environnement – PLAGE) were prepared for the communities of the Complexe Est (i.e., Adjara,
          So-Ava, Porto-Novo, Sèmè-Podji and Aguégués), and for communities of the Complexe Ouest
          (i.e., Ouidah and Abomey-Calavi). Equally established was an inter-communal plan for
          environmental management (Plan Intercommunal d’Aménagement et de Gestion de
          l’Environnement - PIAGE) to provide support across communities. Priority activities noted in these
          plans are currently being implemented by the CIEDs in partnership with other developments
          partners (see above).
         Also strengthened was the technical capacity for integrated and sustainable coastal zone
          management at the Government level. Substantial numbers of stakeholders were trained in various
          aspects. 49 project staff of the Benin Environment Agency were trained in project management,
          M&E, financial management, and procurement (Revised Intermediate Result Indicator #12 – 100
          percent).
         Lastly, progress was made towards establishing a mechanism that allows the Government to
          generate and disseminate credible data and information on coastal biodiversity to help monitor the
          status of coastal and marine biodiversity. ABE’s existing environmental information and
          monitoring system (Système d’Information et de Suivi de l’Environnement – SISE) was upgraded
          with the addition of a coastal and marine biodiversity database. The database was informed by a
          large amount of data collection, 46 and even though remaining base line data is still being collected,
          the database is accessible to stakeholders and allows for the generation and dissemination of data
          (Original Intermediate Result Indicator #11 – 50 percent; Revised Intermediate Result Indicator #8

44 The Conseil intercommunal d’Ecodéveloppement (CIED) Lagunes Côtières (Complexe Ouest) and the CIED Nokoué (Complexe
Est), which includes five communities of the Ramsar 1018 site.
45 The CIED Lagunes Côtières has almost finalized the adoption process. The prefect amended the decree, and the CIED held a

meeting to incorporate comments; the Project is expected to be introduced to the Government for adoption in the coming months.
The CIED Nokoué, however, has not started the adoption process.
46 The creation of the database was informed by a capacity assessment of the existing SISE; the management plans for the three

CBCAs; a monograph of the CBCAs; and an ecological inventory and ecotoxicology assessment to determine the level of pollution
and degradation of biological resources. The Project also obtained five satellite images, which contributed to the preparation of a
study on mapping the coastal zone.

                                                                16
          – 75 percent).47 The hardware and software necessary for the operation of the integrated database
          and the effective functioning of the biodiversity monitoring and evaluation system, was purchased
          and set up. The coastal and marine biodiversity monitoring system is equally in place (Revised
          Intermediate Result Indicator #10 – 100 percent), albeit no monitoring activity including the use of
          newly defined indicators on marine biodiversity (Revised Intermediate Result Indicator #9 – 50
          percent) has taken place to date (Original Intermediate Result Indicators #10 – 0 percent). However,
          even though the monitoring system is not yet in use, the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool
          (METT) was used in collaboration with the communities in 2011, 2013 and 2014, and provided
          valuable information in comparison to the data acquired during project preparation. Increasing
          management effectiveness was measured.48
41.    The sustainable use of biological diversity was further promoted through the establishment of
three CBCAs in biodiversity priority sites, and through supporting the livelihood and economic
opportunities of the local communities living near and around the conservation.
         Three CBCAs were established in biodiversity priority sites: Three CBCAs were created and
          demarcated under communal order, and subsequently adopted by ministerial decree on October 21,
          2013 (Revised PDO Indicator #1 – 100 percent).49 The decrees are, however, still awaiting
          presidential signature to fully ensure their legal recognition in the long-term.50 Each CBCA consists
          of a core area where little if any resource extraction is allowed, and a buffer zone, in which
          controlled livelihood activities are allowed. Management units and conservation charters for each
          of the CBCAs were established; and management plans (which however are yet to be adopted by
          the communities) were prepared and validated by a technical group. The technical working group
          on coastal and marine biodiversity management was created in 2010, and provided technical
          assistance to the management units and community members of the CBCAs through regular visits
          (Revised Intermediate Result Indicator #2 - 100 percent).51
         Prior to and during creation of the CBCAs, the relevant community members were extensively
          sensitized on the Project’s objectives (Revised Intermediate Result Indicator #4 – 100 percent). In
          addition, to enable beneficiaries to better manage the CBCAs in the short- and long-term, training
          sessions were organized for 623 community actors in the following areas: marine and coastal
          resource conservation and management, tools and techniques for community-based natural



47 The remaining data necessary for the database’s full functioning is still being collected, and will be available upon finaliz ation
of the report on the status of the coastal zone.
48 Collected METT data for Togbin-Adounko: Project appraisal: 33; 2011: 26; 2013: 47; and 2014: 98. For Vodounto: Project

appraisal: 22; 2011: 29; 2013: 44; and 2014: 88. For Bamezoun: Project appraisal: 22; 2011: 20; 2013: 38; and 2014: 72.
49 The three CBCAs include (i) Vodounto in the Commune of Ouidah, Arrondissement de Avlékété, Village de Hio (communal

order number 05/072/CO/SG/SAG of November 9, 2011); (ii) Bamezoun in the Commune of Aguégués/Dangbo (communal order
number 1D/001/SG-SADE of January 19, 2012); and (iii) Togbin-Adounko in the Commune of Abomey-Calavi (communal order
number 21/050/C-AC/SG/DST/SEE/SAC of June 5, 2012).
50 The related presidential decree on the three sites was approved by the Council of Ministers on October 21, 2013 (Affaire 110/14).

51 The technical working group on coastal and marine biodiversity management was officially established through a ministerial

order (arête ministerial number 0022/MEPN/DC/SGM/ABE/SA). Since its creation the group met once or twice per year. The
technical working group met twice in 2010, 2012, and 2013; and once in 2011.

                                                                 17

        planning, and monitoring of activities.

       To finance the transition costs for moving away from conservation-unfriendly practices in the
        CBCAs, the Project further supported the livelihood and economic opportunities of the local
        communities living near and around the conservation areas by enabling them to conduct
        environmentally-friendly business activities. The Project mainstreamed biodiversity conservation
        into agriculture, fisheries, and other livelihood activities that are practiced in the buffer zones of
        each CBCA, through 149 income-generating activities together with 13 micro projects at the
        communal level (Revised Intermediate Result Indicator #6 – 100 percent). Infrastructure for market
        gardening (e.g., water pumps, sprayers, development of irrigated areas, seeds, organic fertilizers),
        fish farming (e.g., fish ponds, fish cages, fish pens, above-ground fish tanks), and transport (e.g.,
        motorized boats, tricycles, motorcycles) was provided to enable community members to engage in
        income generating activities such as the production and sale of market products, fish farming, salt
        trade, fish processing and marketing, and palm oil production. 1,887 community members
        including 924 women have directly benefitted from these activities (Revised Intermediate Result
        Indicator #7 – 100 percent). A socio-economic analysis of these activities noted that beneficiaries
        particularly benefitted from the provision of equipment and capacity building as it increased their
        economic opportunities.
42.      GEO and PDO achievement against original targets was achieved to an unsatisfactory extent.
The rating against original targets is mainly based on the major shortcoming associated with (i) the failure
to enact and enforce the envisaged coastal zone framework law, the national Inter-Sectorial Commission
(ISC) and subsequent National Commission for Coastal Zone Protection and Management (NCCZPM), and
the coastal zone master plan; (ii) the failure to create the CBCAs early during project implementation so
that activities envisaged under the associated management could have been implemented prior to project
closure. As detailed in Section 2.2, the Project was experiencing significant implementation delays during
the first three years, and the Project was subsequently restructured including the simplification of the
Project's indicators.
43.     GEO and PDO achievement against revised targets was achieved to a moderately unsatisfactory
extent. The rating against revised targets is mainly based on significant shortcomings associated with the
achievements’ sustainability. The Project succeeded in (i) creating coordination and monitoring
mechanisms at the communal and inter-communal level; (ii) building capacity for the effective design and
implementation of interventions; and (iii) establishing the envisaged three Community-Based Conservation
Areas (CBCA) together with participatory management mechanisms. To strengthen the sustainable use of
biological diversity, the Project successfully helped mainstreaming biodiversity conservation into
agriculture, fisheries, and other livelihood activities that are practiced near the conservation areas. However,
even though the Project achieved most of its revised targets to a substantial extent, it is uncertain whether
the Project’s outcomes will fully unfold and be sustained (see also Section 2.5).
44.     Weighted average PDO – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: At restructuring in May 2011, the
Project had disbursed US$0.75 million representing 17 percent of total disbursed funds of US$4.3 million.
On this basis and as illustrated by the table below, the weighted average of the Project’s PDO achievement
is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. Annex 2 provides a comprehensive account of qualitative and

indicators.

3.3         EFFICIENCY
45.      Efficiency – Rating Modest: The Project’s overall efficiency is rated modest, mainly because of
the limited data available to comprehensively demonstrate that project resources were used efficiently. Even
though resources of the GEF grant were fully utilized, project objectives were only achieved to a moderately
unsatisfactory extent. The main factors that constrained the Project’s efficiency are outlined in Section 2.1
and 2.2. They included: (i) an ambitious project design that underestimated the time needed for negotiations
and consultations; (ii) insufficient government support leading to non-achievement of important project
targets (i.e., adoption of the coastal zone framework law) and low counterpart funding; and (iii) project
management issues caused by a high turnover in project staff including the Project coordinator that led to
communication and collaboration problems.
46.    The design and structure of this project was not amendable to a full stand-alone financial or
economic analysis, as the environmental, social and capacity building benefits were difficult to quantify.
The preparation of an economic and financial analysis at project completion was equally constrained52.
47.      The value and cost-effectiveness of the environmental, social, and capacity-building benefits were
difficult to quantify; and equally difficult to assess were the Project’s studies and consultancies, as many of
them were produced with significant delays. What remains are activities associated with the CBCAs under
component 2 including the income-generating activities and micro-projects the Project financed [49 percent
of total project costs]. In March 2014, a social-economic impact analysis was carried out by an independent
local consultant and analyzed the impact of the Project’s income-generating activities that were financed in
the buffer zones of the CBCAs. While allocated resources were used efficiently, the activities’ impact was
considered satisfactory. Main conclusions included that activities were most appreciated for their capacity
building and provision of equipment. The specialized capacity training allowed for technical improvements
of production, conservation, breeding, and processing, and provision of equipment allowed for production
capacity increases. At the same time, the analysis notes that mechanisms that sustain these outcomes need
to be put in place.


52   Consequently, the ICR does not include an economic analysis annex.

                                                               19
3.4     JUSTIFICATION OF OVERALL OUTCOME RATING
48.     The preceding discussion showed that: (i) relevance of the Project is substantial; (ii) achievement
of PDO is moderately unsatisfactory; and (iii) efficiency is modest. Based on this evaluation, the Project’s
overall outcome rating is moderately unsatisfactory.

3.5     OVERARCHING THEMES, OTHER OUTCOMES AND IMPACTS
49.      Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development: The income-generating activities and
micro-projects that were conducted in the buffer zones of the CBCAs had a direct positive impact on the
incomes of associated community members, including women. Of the 1,887 community members that
benefitted from these project activities, 924 were women. Poverty levels have gone down in the
communities surrounding the CBCAs, however, since there are other development projects ongoing in this
area, and the beneficiaries only represent a fraction of the CBCAs’ total population, it is difficult to solely
attribute these poverty impacts to the Project’s income-generating activities.
50.     Institutional Change/Strengthening: The Project strengthened the Government’s institutional
capacity together with coordination mechanisms through: (i) the adoption of a national coastal and marine
biodiversity management strategy together with plans that outline the creation and responsibilities of the
administrative bodies of the Government that will be responsible for the strategy’s implementation; (ii) the
creation of two communal councils together with two inter-communal councils to coordinate economic
development and the management of critical natural resources in communal territories, and areas that span
over several municipalities; (iii) the upgrading of ABE’s existing environmental information and
monitoring system through the addition of a coastal and marine biodiversity database, which eventually
helps monitoring the status of coastal and marine biodiversity; (iv) the experience and skills gained in
managing the Project, particularly in the areas of procurement and financial management, which can be
easily applied to other projects and subsequently contribute to success; and (v) knowledge gained through
the various training courses.
51.     Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts: No unintended outcomes and impacts were noted.

3.6     SUMMARY OF FINDINGS OF BENEFICIARY SURVEY AND/OR STAKEHOLDER
        WORKSHOP
52.     No beneficiary survey or stakeholder workshop was conducted.


4.      ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME
53.     Risk to development outcome – Rating Substantial: As described in Section 3.2, many of the
Project’s outputs were achieved, and conservation mechanisms are in place to sustain the Project’s
outcomes. Nevertheless, the Government’s support will be critical in sustaining the Project’s outcomes in
the long-term. Since the Government’s commitment during project implementation was low, the risk to
development outcome is rated substantial. Specifically, government support will be needed in the following
areas:




                                                      20
54.      First, to confirm the three CBCAs in their aim to protect and maintain biodiversity and natural
habitat at the national level, their juridical status needs to be confirmed by the President. Second, continued
capacity reinforcement will be crucial: (i) stakeholder awareness needs to be continuously raised; (ii) the
capacity of the institutions charged with managing the CBCAs (i.e., the CIEDs) needs to be further built;
and (iii) continued support needs to be ensured for the income-generating activities, which provide an
alternative to the destructive use of natural resources. In addition, long-term financing for the CIEDs needs
to be secured so that their adequate functioning is guaranteed. An adoption process for the CIEDs to be
recognized as public institutions, which would provide access to public funds, has started but needs to be
finalized. Lastly, it will be crucial to complete the coastal and marine biodiversity database so that the
biodiversity monitoring and evaluation system can be effectively used to monitor changes in the status and
trends in environmental health and ecological stability of biodiversity of the coastal zone.


5.      ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

5.1     WORLD BANK
55.      Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: As noted
in Section 2.1, project preparation was comprehensive, and adequately conducted with participation of
authorities and local communities. The initial selection of potential CBCAs was informed by studies
focusing on the feasibility of the suggested conservation sites, threatened species, and land tenure
constraints. The STAP Roster Review was supportive of the Project, and confirmed that there was sufficient
ecological and technical information available to give the Project a reasonably sound scientific base.
Fiduciary aspects were well prepared, based on thorough assessments of capacities in procurement and
financial management. Relevant safeguards were assessed and addressed in the Project design.
56.     However, even though the Project was carefully and comprehensively designed, it showed some
weaknesses. The Project was ambitious with its numerous activities planned under the Project’s time frame;
and the Project’s results framework should have been more concise and the indicators better aligned with
the PDO. Lastly, the results framework should have placed more emphasis on the enactment and
enforcement of the envisaged regulatory instruments.
57.     Quality of Supervision – Rating Moderately Satisfactory: From the beginning on, the World Bank
team identified implementation delays, and worked closely with the borrower to address key bottlenecks.
However, even though the team was candid and rigorous in assessing project implementation issues,
capturing these in detailed aide-memoires, raising issues with government officials, increasing
implementation support missions (i.e., three missions in 2009), and proposing corrective measures (i.e., the
recruitment of an local technical expert), project implementation continued to be significantly delayed
during the first three years.
58.      Eventually, the World Bank team correctly proposed revising the Project’s components and
indicators to focus the Project on achievable activities (i.e., focusing only on three instead of four
conservation areas and dropping the adoption of the coastal zone framework law). The Level II restructuring
in 2011 also rightly included the reallocation of funds and an extension of the closing date. Together with
the restructuring, the World Bank team helped prepare a three-year action plan covering the extended
implementation period, to focus on priority activities to be implemented, which sustained implementation

                                                      21
progress until project closure. However, even though the Project’s restructuring simplified project
implementation and allowed for improved implementation progress, the Bank team should have been more
proactive in reacting to the Government’s low commitment by either closing the Project or modifying the
PDO early during project implementation. In addition, the revised project’s components and indicators
should have been better linked to the Project’s outcomes rather than outputs to more effectively measure
PDO achievement.
59.      Overall Bank Performance – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: The overall performance rating
considers the moderately unsatisfactory rating for performance in ensuring quality at entry, the moderately
satisfactory rating for quality of supervision, and the moderately unsatisfactory rating for overall project
outcome.

5.2       BORROWER
60.      Government Performance – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: Even though government
commitment was strong during project preparation, commitment was moderately unsatisfactory during
project implementation. Government performance towards meeting project effectiveness requirements was
slow, and particularly the failure to adopt the originally envisaged regulatory instruments substantially
effected project implementation. The Project’s legal covenants outlined in the PAD were only partly
complied with: Due to slow project disbursements during the first years of project implementation, the
Government did not provide counterpart funding as agreed in the covenants; even after project
implementation improved, counterpart funding remained low53. The lack of funds affected project
implementation; it contributed to the necessity to restructure the Project, and to reallocating funds to the
operating costs, which were intended to be funded by the Government. Also cumbersome was the lengthy
and bureaucratic nature of the National Department of Public Procurement, which significantly slowed
down approval and administrative procedures, necessary for the implementation agency’s ability to increase
disbursements.
61.      Implementing Agency Performance – Rating Moderately Satisfactory: The Project was
implemented by ABE, which was under the Ministry of Environment and Protection of Nature (Ministère
de l’Environnement et de la Protection de la Nature - MEPN). During the first three years of project
implementation, the Project experienced long delays and periodic standstill of activities. Project
management was characterized by several shortcomings which significantly affected project
implementation and led to periodic unsatisfactory ratings between 2009 and 2010: (i) ineffective
institutional arrangements with a high turnover rate of key staff including the Project Coordinator; (ii)
inexperienced technical staff; (iii) communication and collaboration issues; and (iv) low performance in
financial management, and M&E implementation and utilization. However, beginning 2011, project
management improved as confirmed by satisfactory levels, and sustained until the end of the Project.

53  As per the covenants of the grant (outlined in the PAD), the Government was supposed to deposit CFA 200 million in the
Project’s account within 10 months of project effectiveness, and continue to deposit CFA 100 million every six month till project
closure; as well as maintain at least the same level of budgetary allocations to ABE for the implementation of the national program
for environmental management (Programme National de Gestion de l’Environnement). The Government did not comply with either
of these legal covenants. The Government only once deposited CFA 200 million at the beginning of project implementation, before
the Government’s contribution declined. Furthermore, ABE’s budgetary allocations were reduced on a yearly basis throughout
project implementation.

                                                                22
Implementation progress significantly improved. Additional shortcomings only occurred shortly before
project closing in the procurement. Delivery of works, equipment and services was occasionally delayed,
including non-compliance with World Bank procurement procedures in a couple of instances.
62.     Overall borrower performance – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: Overall borrower
performance takes into consideration both the Government’s and implementing agency’s performance
during preparation and implementation. On the basis of the justification provided above, overall borrower
performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.


6.       LESSONS LEARNED
63.      Lessons learned that were drawn and which could serve as guidance for similar projects in the
future include the following:

        The country’s lengthy and bureaucratic nature of the National Department of Public
         Procurement needs to be taken into account when designing projects. The lengthy and
         bureaucratic nature of the department significantly slowed down approval and administrative
         procedures, and thus substantially hampered the Project team’s ability to increase disbursement.
        The Project's PDO and indicators should be carefully reviewed during project preparation. A
         strong results framework including indicators that are realistic and directly linked to the PDO is
         fundamental in achieving envisaged project outcomes.
        A strong M&E framework including a dedicated M&E officer is of paramount importance. Until
         2012, no M&E system had been put in place, which would have allowed ABE to effectively assess
         implementation progress, and to monitor activities against disbursements as envisaged in the PAD.
         With the modifications introduced during the Project’s restructuring and the eventual establishment
         of an M&E system, the monitoring and reporting improved. The simplification of the Project’s
         indicators facilitated easier reporting and monitoring, and a newly designated and subsequently
         trained M&E officer closely monitored project activities and reported against the Project’s
         indicators.

        Government commitment at all levels is a crucial factor in achieving the Project's envisaged
         outcomes. The Bank should react promptly (i.e., revising the PDO or closing the Project) to any
         indications of diminishing commitment levels or other factors that indicate envisaged project
         outcomes may not be achieved. The Project’s design was based on (i) the assumption that
         substantial contributions in counterpart funding would materialize (i.e., US$7.3 million in
         counterpart funding compared to US$4.3 million in GEF funding); and (ii) the Government’s
         commitment to adopting several legal instruments. The Project would have benefitted from a
         restructuring in the beginning of project implementation (i.e., as soon as the change in the
         Government’s priorities became visible) to refocus project activities early on.

        Sufficient time needs to be allocated for stakeholder consultations and negotiations associated
         with the establishment of the CBCAs. Consultations and negotiations with local communities and
         authorities associated with creating the CBCAs turned out to be more complicated and lengthier



                                                     23
         than envisaged. Disbursements were subsequently slow as most project investments were tied to
         the creation of the CBCAs.

        Financing mechanisms that ensure project outcomes will be sustained beyond the Project's
         lifetime are important to establish during project implementation. Given the fact that the long-
         term impact of the CBCAs primarily depends on financing the recurrent costs for managing the
         protected areas, a sustainability instrument must be put in place prior to project closure. A financing
         window to Benin’s existing conservation trust fund could be considered.
        A regional approach to managing coastal marine biodiversity should be fostered. There are
         several coastal, marine and biodiversity management projects ongoing in West Africa, and the
         World Bank should consider developing a regional approach for their collective management rather
         than the present country-by-country approach.

        It is important to carefully review the Project's last ISR to avoid a possible disconnect with the
         ICR's rating.
        The ICR review meeting should be conducted as early as possible to allow for sufficient time for
         revisions and government consultation prior to its submission to the Board.

         AGENCY/PARTNERS
64.     The counterpart submitted a completion report, a summary of which is included in Annex 4. The
findings and substance of the report are consistent with the teams’ conclusions in this ICR. The
counterpart’s report further states that the benefits from the project go beyond the formal project results
framework. In addition, the draft ICR (translated into French) was shared with the Government; no
comments were received until the time of submission of this ICR.

ANNEX 4: SUMMARY OF BORROWER’S ICR AND/OR COMMENTS ON DRAFT ICR
RÉSUMÉ EXÉCUTIF
1. La mission d'évaluation finale du PGCBMC est une activité normale inscrite dans le document du
   projet. Conformément aux TDR de cette mission, l'évaluation porte sur la phase de la mise en
   œuvre du projet. Il est particulièrement question d'élaborer un rapport d'achèvement du PGCBMC
   dont les aspects suivants seront analysés : le contexte du projet, la présentation du projet restructuré,
   les facteurs ayant influencés la mise en œuvre et les résultats du projet, la performance de la gestion du
   projet, l'évaluation des résultats du projet, l'impact socio-économique, la durabilité, la performance des
   deux parties et enfin les enseignements tirés de la mise en œuvre du projet.
2. Conception du projet : Conformément aux directives du FEM, le projet s'inscrit dans le domaine de la
   préservation des ressources naturelles notamment marine et côtière. Ainsi, grâce au Projet de Gestion
   Communautaire de la Biodiversité Marine et Côtière (PGCBMC) quatre Aires Communautaires de
   Conservation de la Biodiversité ont été identifiées. Soutenu et financé par le Fonds pour
   l'Environnement Mondial (FEM), le PGCBMC a permis la création de trois (03) Aires Communautaires
   de Conservation de la Biodiversité (ACCB), et financé sous forme de dons des Activités Génératrices
   de Revenus (AGR) au profit des populations riveraines des ACCB.
3. Le document de projet a été particulièrement ambitieux en termes des résultats et des impacts attendus
   de la mise en œuvre du projet, dont la durée n'est que de 5 ans. Des indicateurs de réalisation repris
   dans le document sont pour la plupart non quantifiables et ne peuvent être mesurés qu'à la suite d'une
   appropriation par les bénéficiaires des acquis du projet, permettant ainsi de mesurer, dans le temps, les
   changements intervenus dans l'utilisation des ressources naturelles et de la production agricole pour
   réduire la vulnérabilité de la biodiversité face à une pression anthropique sans cesse grandissante.
4. Les composantes retenues pour la mise en œuvre du projet sont concrètes même si dans la composante
   relative à la création des organisations des communautés à la base on n'a pas prévu un plan de
   communication idoine. Il aurait également fallu considérer l'adoption de la loi sur le littoral comme une
   condition critique et prévoir les mesures de mitigation.
5. Au plan institutionnel, le projet est placé sous la tutelle de l'ancien Ministère de l'Environnement, de
   l'Habitat et de l'Urbanisme (MEHU) qui est chargé de la conservation de la nature, de la gestion des
   politiques et problèmes environnementaux. L'agence Béninoise pour l'Environnement (ABE) est la
   structure d'exécution du Projet. A cet effet, elle assure le rôle de secrétariat permanent du Comité de
   Pilotage (CP) en tant qu'organe de mise en œuvre de la composante et exécute toutes les tâches liées au
   suivi - évaluation consolidé en utilisant l'Observatoire de la zone littorale. Aussi des comités de pilotage
   et des unités de gestion ont été mises en place pour appuyer la mise en œuvre du projet.
6. Au plan technique, on constate que certains délais d'exécution prévus pour certaines activités sont très
   courts au vu des retards observés dans leur mise œuvre.
7. Mise en œuvre du projet: Depuis son démarrage, le projet a eu quatre (04) équipes de coordination.
   Cela constitue sans doute un élément potentiellement nuisible au fonctionnement harmonieux et
   efficace du projet.




                                                      39
8. Comme, il a été rapporté dans les rapports d'auto-évaluation du PGCBMC, un certain nombre d'activités
   programmées au niveau des différentes composantes n'ont pas été exécuté dans les délais requis. Les
   raisons qui expliquent cette situation sont entre autres :
       la lenteur administrative ;
       les procédures longues pour le vote des lois sur le littoral ;
       les appels à manifestation d'intérêts déclarés infructueux à plusieurs reprises ;
       les cabinets ad hoc sollicités non disponibles ;
       la non disponibilité à temps des résultats des études.
9. L'un des résultats du PGCBMC est la création dans le domaine côtier de trois Aires Communautaires
   de Conservation de la Biodiversité (ACCB) qui sont reconnues à travers la signature d'arrêté communal
   de création des ACCB. Ces aires communautaires sont :
       ACCB VODOUNTO de 17 ha dans la commune de Ouidah, Arrondisssement de Avlékété, Village
        de Hio;
       ACCB TOGBIN ADOUNKO de 89 ha dans la commune d'Abomey-Calavi;
       ACCB BAMEZOUN de 18,62 ha, dans les communes des Aguégués et de Dangbo avec une
        délimitation de 5m de Zone tampon tout autour.
10. L'ABE dispose aujourd'hui d'une base de données assez fournies de ces ACCB à travers les nombreuses
    études réalisées. Néanmoins, il faut noter que la délimitation et la création des ACCB sont les seules
    activités physiques réalisées à ce jour.
11. L'une des stratégies de ce projet a été également de financer des initiatives économiques à caractère
    individuel et collectif (micro-projets et AGR) et d'autres socio-communautaires au profit des
    populations des 3 ACCB. Ainsi, la quasi-totalité des activités prévues en ce qui concerne la première
    série de conventions signées avec les bénéficiaires ont été réalisées et en ce qui concerne les autres
    conventions, elles sont réalisées à environ 75%. Le taux global financière se situe autour de 77,45% et
    le taux global physique de réalisation se situe en moyenne autour de 79,33%.
12. Dans le cadre de la conservation des infrastructures de production ou de transformation, de stockage et
    de conservation pour une augmentation de la productivité et de capacité des conservation des produits
    destinés à la commercialisation, la plupart des équipements prévus pour être mis à la disposition des
    bénéficiaires du programme AGR l'ont déjà.
13. Sur le plan financier: Le Système de gestion financière du Projet de Gestion Communautaire de la
    Biodiversité Marine et Côtière (PGCBMC) est satisfaisant. Le projet a soumis quarante-quatre (44)
    demandes de réapprovisionnement de fonds (DRF) à la Banque Mondiale depuis 2009 à ce jour et son
    taux de consommation a atteint 100,00%. Le solde disponible à ce jour est de cent quarante-huit
    millions quatre cent cinquante-neuf mille cinq cent neuf (148.459.509) Francs CFA dans les livres du
    projet à la BCEAO et à ECOBANK contre Zéro (0) dans les livres de la Banque Mondiale. Une
    demande (n°45) est en voie d'acheminement pour environ 74.611.982 F CFA. Le processus de
    recouvrement de l'avance initiale a démarré sur la DRF 44 pour un montant de 26.928.509 F CFA.



                                                      40
14. Les ressources mobilisées au titre du Don (FEM+ETAT) sont évaluées de nos jours à Deux milliards
    deux cent un millions deux cent trente-six mille deux cent cinquante-neuf (2.201.236.259) francs CFA
    contre trois milliards cent cinquante millions (3.150.000.000) francs CFA soit une mobilisation globale
    de 69,88%.
15. Les dépenses sont exécutées ainsi qu'il suit :
       Catégorie 1 Biens 79,51%
       Catégorie 2 Travaux 49,33%
       Catégorie 3 Services de Consultants 99,84%
       Catégorie 4 Sous financement pour Sous projets 98,33%
       Catégorie 5 Coûts de Fonctionnement 86,37%
16. Les rapports intérimaires financiers semestriels au nombre de onze (11) sont transmis régulièrement
    avec une qualité jugée acceptable.
17. Les rapports d'audit interne et externe au titre de l'exercice 2013 ont été déposés dans les meilleurs
    délais et seront transmis à la Banque Mondiale sous peu.
18. La stratégie du PGCBMC est le faire-faire. Ainsi, les taux d'exécution (financière et physique) des plans
    annuels de passation de marché pour l'acquisition des biens et services pour le projet apparaissent
    comme des indicateurs incontestables d'efficacité de mise en œuvre des activités programmées. En
    Avril 2014, le taux d'engagement est de 97,91% ce qui dénote globalement d'une bonne performance
    financière du projet.
19. Au début du projet, l'exécution n'a pas utilisé le dispositif de suivi et évaluation comme outils de
    gestion. Le dispositif de suivi-évaluation a été formalisé en début de l'année 2012 et un manuel de suivi-
    évaluation existe.
20. Le mécanisme de suivi évaluation mis en place au niveau du programme, a adopté le principe de
    rapportage écrit, des réunions périodiques de concertation et les visites de terrain. Ce mécanisme
    fonctionne d'après une pyramide à base élargie où les informations remontent de la base au sommet.
    Les acteurs de ce mécanisme sont ci-après : (i) les chargés de mission (ii) les prestataires (iii) les
    bénéficiaires (iv) le chargé de suivi évaluation, (v) le coordonnateur du projet, (vi) les deux partenaires
    dont le FEM et le gouvernement béninois.
21. Mais en dépit de tout ce dispositif, les informations disponibles sur la mise en œuvre du programme
    comparées à celles consignées dans les documents de référence du programme signalent un dispositif
    de suivi-évaluation plus axé sur les moyens que sur les résultats. En effet, la mesure des progrès telle
    que consignée dans les différents rapports annuels d'activités et de capitalisation, ont plus mis l'accent
    sur les réalisations physiques et les moyens financés correspondants en terme de décaissement.
22. D'une manière globale, le projet a atteint les résultats attendus et ses effets touchent les bénéficiaires
    ultimes, constitués de plus au moins 1669 personnes avec un montant de financement qui avoisine les
    505 millions de FCFA pour l'ensemble des sites du projet.
