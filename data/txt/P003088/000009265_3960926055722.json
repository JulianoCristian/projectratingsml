First, new\n            employment opportunities will be generated.  Second, Zairian\n            entrepreneurship will be developed.  Third, the\n            participation of financial intermediaries will be increased\n            through large branch networks in the development of SSEs.\n            This will contribute to the decentralization of economic\n            activity.  Finally, Zaire's ability to prepare,\n            appraise and supervise SSE projects will be developed.\n            These objectives will be supported by a package of credit,\n            technical assistance and training specifically tailored to\n            the needs of enterprises in Zaire."}, "docdt": "1987-04-03T00:00:00Z"}
