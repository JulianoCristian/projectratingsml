  intermediaries to subborrowers for investments in\n            agriculture and other productive activities in rural areas.\n            The project has two equally important objectives. One is to\n            provide funds for farm and non-farm investments in rural\n            areas, and for working capital complementary to such\n            investments, to promote: (a) agricultural exports to improve\n            the country's balance of payments; (b) increased rural\n            production, incomes, and consumption; and (c) rural\n            employment. The other is to improve institutional capacity\n            to provide credit efficiently and to assist farmers to\n            develop bookkeeping and managerial skills. The project would\n            consist of (a) a line of credit for both agricultural and\n            non-farm investments; (b) a line of short-term credit to\n            cover working capital needs generated by investments; (c)\n            incremental staffing and equipment for a Project Unit (PU)\n            in BCH to supervise and coordinate administration of credit\n            funds by Financial Intermediaries; and (d) training for\n            staff of both the PU and FIs and for small-scale farmers."}, "docdt": "1983-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
