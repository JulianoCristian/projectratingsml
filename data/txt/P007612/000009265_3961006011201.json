        services and extend their coverage in participating medium\n            size cities; b) strengthen the capacity of Banco Nacional de\n            Obras y Servicios Publicos and the Ministry of Social\n            Development to appraise and supervise solid waste projects\n            and provide technical assistance to municipalities; c)\n            increase technical, administrative and regulatory capacity\n            at the state and local levels to improve sector management\n            and operations; d) improve the legal and regulatory\n            framework and cost recovery mechanisms of the sector to\n            encourage greater private sector involvement and safeguard\n            the environment; e) correct environmental problems and\n            reduce health hazards caused by inadequate collection and\n            disposal systems; and f) mitigate the social impact on\n            scavangers of the establishment of modern waste collection\n            and disposal systems. The project will have three main\n            components: 1) strengthening of federal institutions, local\n            governments and operating agencies which play a key role in\n            development of the sector; 2) supporting the investment\n            needs of participating cities through implementation of\n            comprehensive and integrated solid waste management plans;\n            and 3) providing support for scavengers and informal workers\n            impacted by the project through a social component."}, "docdt": "1994-05-16T00:00:00Z"}
