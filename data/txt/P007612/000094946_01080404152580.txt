3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
Context
At the time of preparation, Mexico had just signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
and this project was part of an arnbitious package of projects processed in relatively short time (Water and



Sanitation II and Northern Border Environment Project) and made available with the stated objective of
assisting Mexico's adjustment in the environment sector in response to the requirements of NAFTA and the.
commitments made under the CEC (Commission on Environmental Cooperation).
Project design and the development objectives were primarily influenced by the conditions of the solid
waste sector in Mexico. At that time, Mexico was undergoing rapid urbanization especially in small- and
medium-size cities, that, combined with federal government reforms to enhance participation of local
governments, placed significant pressure on the municipalities in these cities to undertake additional
responsibilities and be more responsive to the need for local environmental services. This was especially
evident in the solid waste sector which was assessed through extensive project preparation activities and
through the experience of the pilot project. The solid waste sector was characterized as having: (i) weak
institutions at the federal, state and local level; (ii) a limited supply of qualified professionals; (iii)
insufficient coverage and a lack of controlled final disposal; (iv) inadequate cost recovery which did not
permit sustainable investments; (v) an undeveloped regulatory framework; (vi) inadequate consideration
of the environmental effects of solid waste disposal practices; (vii) a large amount of scavenger
communities, making the adoption of modern solid waste systems difficult and raising difficult social
issues; and (viii) limited recycling.
Objectives
In response to this complex situation in the solid waste sector, the main original objectives of the project
were to: (a) improve solid waste services and extend their coverage in participating medium size and
priority cities; (b) strengthen the capacity of BANOBRAS and SEDESOL to appraise and supervise solid
waste projects and provide technical assistance to municipalities and states; (c) increase technical,
administrative and regulatory capacity at the state and local levels to improve sector management and
operations; (d) improve the legal and regulatory framework and cost recovery mechanisms of the sector to
encourage private sector involvement and safeguard the environment; (e) correct environmental problems
and reduce health hazards caused by inadequate collection and disposal systems; and (f) mitigate the social
impact of the establishment of modem waste collection and disposals systems on scavengers.
The objectives, as was said before, were designed as a direct response to the deficiencies identified in the
sector through the pilot project and during project preparation. They also were consistent with the Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) and government policies. The CAS supported programs aimed at improvements
in environmental management and devolution of expenditure and revenue responsibilities to local
governments. Similarly, the project reflected the government's priorities in improving environmental
management and fiscal decentralization. The project was also consistent with ongoing government policies
in the sector and helped the government identify new priorities for the sector.
Reflecting the thorough preparation, the objectives tried to address all of the identified deficiencies in this
sector in a comprehensive manner. As a result, the project design was quite complex with an
interdependence of objectives and uncertainty as to their ability to act in a coordinated fashion to improve
the sector. In hindsight, the complexity of the issues intended to be addressed should have precluded a
complex project design. Also, as originally designed, the project relied exclusively on SEDESOL's and the
local government's participation. At an institutional level, there should have been more of an involvement
from regional and local environmental authorities. In particular, the successful implementation of the
investment component was dependent on the successful strengthening of the federal, state and local
institutions and policies in the institutional component. This should have been identified at the start as an
ambitious goal.
3.2 Revised Objective:
-2 -



Context
The project was originally approved by the Board on June 9, 1994 and became effective on September 29,
1995. Less than three months after signing of the loan, the Mexican economy suffered a recession, lasting
over 2 years. High interest rates contributed to the slumping economy, increased bankruptcy rates and
caused drastic cuts in the federal budget. Because of these fiscal difficulties and despite significant efforts
at maintaining the viability of the project, BANOBRAS, the implementing agency, requested the
cancellation of a total of US$193.06 million out of the original loan of US$200 million (over 95% of
resources allocated) in two steps. On July 13, 1995 US$140 million was canceled and on April 28, 1997
US$53.06 million was canceled. The requests for cancellation were not sudden but rather a reflection of
the inability of the project to place the resources with municipalities for the purposes of the project. This
problem was detected during project supervision; however, the decision to cancel was delayed far too long
and in the absence of corrective actions or a wider discussion with the recipients on how to redesign the
project. It should have been apparent that the financial conditions were not available from the start to
implement the investment component and an earlier action was warranted.
In July 1998, three years after the crisis, the project was restructured to address the causes of the poor
performance of the investment component. Before the project was restructured, a small amount of the loan
proceeds were disbursed for the funding of technical assistance and institutional strengthening activities as
originally envisaged in the project scope. Some of the resources were instrumental in the enactment of a
federal standard for selection of solid waste disposal sites. Also, during this period, SEDESOL completed
the preparation of a comprehensive plan for investments in solid waste management with active
participation of several targeted municipalities.
The restructuring in July 1998 was designed to allow the implementation of these investments by
SEDESOL at a time when the federal budgetary difficulties had been addressed and the work completed on
the loan to date had provided enhanced capacity to these municipalities to meet loan conditionalities
(development of: an integrated solid waste management plan, an environmental impact assessment, a social
action plan and a cost recovery plan). The investments focused on a small group of municipalities that had
expressed interest and commitment in participating in the investment program. The restructuring had also
the intended goal of reducing expectations and enabling a higher profile for the institutional development
activities, which had been more successful.
Obiectives
Following approval of the restructuring by the Board on July 24, 1998, the revised objectives of the project
were to: (a) implement a pilot program of sustainable solid waste management at selected municipalities;
(b) strengthen the capacity of BANOBRAS and SEDESOL to appraise and supervise solid waste projects
and provide technical assistance to municipalities and states; (c) increase technical, administrative and
regulatory capacity at selected state and local level agencies to improve sector management and operations;
and, (d) improve the legal and regulatory framework and cost recovery mechanisms of the sector to
safeguard the environment. This set of objectives corresponded better to the realities of the sector.
3.3 Original Components:
The original $415.50 million project had the following three components:
Institutional Strengthening: US $24.7 million
This component was to finance technical assistance to the federal agencies involved in the development and
control of sector policies and regulations. In addition, this component was to finance assistance to states to
regulate solid waste services and to municipalities to strengthen their management and regulatory capacity
and also fulfill eligibility criteria for investments sub-loans.
- 3 -



Investment Support for Implementation of Integrated Solid Waste Management Plans: US $384.7
million
This component was to finance a line of credit through BANOBRAS for onlending to municipalities or
states that comply with subproject eligibility criteria for implementation of integrated solid waste
management plans which would comprise: (a) civil works, such as the closing of open dumps, construction
of transfer stations, landfills, incineration plants, containment cells for hospital wastes, recycling and
composting plants and access roads; (b) purchase of equipment, vehicles and spare parts for collection,
transport and final disposal of solid waste, including hospital waste handled by the municipality; and (c) the
construction and equipping of recycling stations to provide a sanitary, safe and efficient environment for
the scavengers to continue their work near the sanitary landfills.
Social Component for Scavengers: US $6.1 million
This component was to finance: (a) training in basic skills, in specialization in recycling and other
vocational areas, and in basic health, nutrition and child care; (b) construction for families currently living
in dumps which will be closed or transformed into sanitary landfills under the project; and (c) city-specific
market studies for recycling.
3.4 Revised Components:
Tlhe large investment component was not feasible as described above. The borrower and the Bank agreed
(albeit late) on a much more modest investment component, highly focused on municipalities where there
was a perceived high chance of success. The restructured project emphasized the support to capacity
building, information dissemination and training. It sought to link any investments to solid achievements in
these areas. Likewise, the project as restructured was seen more as a tool to identify sustainability in solid
waste management rather than as a lending instrument for acquisition of facilities. The basic premise was
that needed improvements in fiscal and environmental sustainability, rather than the availability of financial
resources, would guarantee the development of the required actions in solid waste management. In
addition, the project also sought to continue the slow process of support to improvements in regulations. As
restructured, the project had the following components:
Institutional Strengthening: US $6.82 million
As restructured, the project focused its efforts in this component. The original objectives remained largely
unchanged. However, emphasis was given to the successful completion of the activities supported under
this component. Capacity Building at the Municipal level was now seen as the crucial development for
achieving the development objective. The goals for the component were to finance technical assistance to
the federal agencies involved in the development and control of sector policies and regulations. In addition,
this component was designed to provide financial assistance to states to regulate solid waste services and to
municipalities to strengthen their management and regulatory capacity. The remaining resources allocated
to this component were to focus on direct consulting and technical assistance services to a small group of
targeted (seven) municipalities and to generic support provided through SEDESOL to the larger group of
medium and small size cities in the country. The focus group of municipalities included: (i) Aguascalientes
(State of Aquascalientes); (ii) Tampico-Madero-Altamira (State of Tamaulipas); (iii) Guanajuato (State of
Guanajuato); (iv) Manzanillo (State of Colima); (v) Mexicali (State of Baja California); (vi) San Luis Rio
Colorado (State of Sonora); (vii) Durango (State of Durango); (viii) Cuautla (State of Moreno); (ix) San
Luis Potosi (State of SLP); (x) Tapachula (State of Chiapas); and (xi) Monterrey (State of Nuevo Le6n).
Sub-loans to Municipalities: US $14.19 million
This component changed drastically. It was no longer a provider of funds but rather a companion to
achievements made under the capacity building activities. In this sense, the financial issue was downgraded
- 4 -



in relevance and the project became more of a pilot for investments rather than a lending instrument. Even
as restructured, BANOBRAS and the Bank team expressed doubts about the ability to place the limited
resources. However, at the end a decision to keep a small investment component was taken as there were at
least a few municipalities that were intent on using financial resources for capital investments. Still, -the
revised component was designed to finance pilot programs (via sub-loans) for the development of integrated
solid waste management plans at the selected municipalities, seeking maximum private sector participation
(the municipalities indicated by numbers i, v, and vi, above had declined participation in the investment
component at the time of restructuring).
3.5 Quality at Entry:
Quality at entry was rated unsatisfactory. The project preparation identified many of the project risks but
underestimated their significance, especially in light of the complexity of the project, institutional
difficulties and interdependence of objectives. In particular, the SAR identified weak institutional capacity
as a project risk and provided mitigation strategies as part of the institutional strengthening program. The
mitigation strategies failed to address some of the basic problems including high turnover of municipal
administrations and the subsequent loss of institutional memory and capacity.
Additionally, the SAR did not identify the risks associated with the viability of the mechanism used to
provide the investment sub-loans to the municipalities. The SAR did not acknowledge the risks that
macroeconomic instability (including high interest rates and municipal debt) could pose to the demand for
sub-loans. Additionally, the possibility that the way funds were transferred from the central government to
the municipalities would be reformed in a way that provided alternative resources for municipalities and
thus undermined the demand for the sub-loans was not listed as a risk in the SAR. In terms of missed
opportunities, the SAR did not identify the evident linkages between solid waste landfills and climate
change.
Not withstanding the foregoing, project preparation thoroughly assessed the problems in the sector and the
lessons learned from the previous project and the project objectives were specifically designed to address
these issues. The project was consistent with government policies and the CAS. The thoroughness of
preparation provided several ancillary benefits to the government and the Bank in terms of information,
ideas and methodologies. In particular, project preparation included a comprehensive study that provided
information on solid waste practices nationwide with more specific information on 25 cities. This study
provided much needed data on the solid waste sector for the Mexican government from which national
policies and local solid waste management plans could be developed. Similarly, the study on scavenger
communities completed during preparation, provided previously unavailable information on these
communities and developed a means of assessing and mitigating the social problems encountered in
developing modern waste management systems in sites with scavengers present. The study was innovative
for its time and subsequent discussions with the government during preparation provided a basis for
initiating new policies to incorporate issues on scavengers in solid waste planning. Finally, the project
developed an innovative way of complying with the Bank's environmental assessment requirements. The
project developed one of the first Sectoral Environmental Assessments in the Bank, a mechanism that is
now routinely used to assess projects such as this with impacts that are sector-wide.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Overall, the project has achieved what was intended after the restructuring. At the time, the alternatives
were: a) cancel the project and declare it unsatisfactory, with significant impacts on sector dialogue; or b)
- 5 -



restructure the project, taking stock of the failure to use it as a financing tool and focus on institutional
strengthening, training and dissemination and some limited subproject finance. In hindsight the decision to
restructure was correct. The project, during the last two years achieved the following: a) facilitated the
development of a new project (Methane Capture and Use) that may result in a new field of action locally
and through-out the region; b) promoted the drafting of a new version of the federal norm regulating landfill
construction, that if enacted, will facilitate the internalization of methane capture and use; c) consolidated
gains in institution building and private sector participation in the sector; and d) finalized a benchmarks
study for assessment of the causes and potential solutions for public and private sector performance in solid
waste management. None of the foregoing would have been achieved had the project been cancelled.
Further, on the basis of the achievements of the restructured project, there remains an intention and
potential scope for continuing dialogue on the sector.
Despite the poor performance of the investment component, in the years before the restructuring, the
implementing agencies carried out a significant share of the activities originally intended to be supported
through the institutional and technical assistance components of the project. The capacity of SEDESOL to
appraise and supervise solid waste projects and provide technical assistance to municipalities has been
strengthened through various training and field programs. Likewise, the regulatory framework has been
improved by the enactment of the federal standard on disposal sites, the development of model regulations
for the operation of municipal solid waste services and the adoption of model terms of reference for
environmental impact assessments (EIA) and social action plans (SAP).
Following restructuring, institutional strengthening and technical assistance to municipalities continued
through training on solid waste management. In addition, a national recycling study was completed by
SEDESOL and disseminated to the municipalities. Despite the reduced funding for investment activities,
achievements were made such as the design and construction of landfills in selected municipalities.
In addition to achievements within the scope of project objectives, the project made two important and
positive impacts within the solid waste management sector in Mexico as a whole. First and notable, the
project facilitated and paved the way for the demonstration project for Methane gas capture and use at a
landfill. This GEF supported project which is currently in its preparatory stages, builds upon the program
of the Mexico Solid Waste II project to modernize solid waste management in small and medium-sized
cities. The Methane project links effectively solid waste management in landfills with climate change
issues. Mexico is a signatory of the Kyoto protocol (ratified by Congress in April 2000) and therefore has
committed to a plan of action to mitigate the release of greenhouse gases. Methane releases from landfills
account for 10% of all methane emissions from Mexico. By combining methane capture and use with
modern solid waste management, an important source of financial resources has been made available to the
sector. The Methane project has shown that Methane releases can be eliminated at a competitive cost in
Mexico (around $5 per ton of CO2 equivalent), which should enable the participation of the sector in the
emerging international carbon market.
Second, as a result of the activities of the project, there has been considerable interest and willingness on
the part of the private sector to engage in management of solid waste in the municipalities. Compared to
the situation prevalent in 1995, there is now a substantial increase in the number of private companies in
solid waste management providing services to municipalities.
A key lesson the project has to offer is that the internalization of environmental issues offers not just a
challenge but an opportunity. Seizing the opening of the Carbon Market, as a complementary funding
mechanism for landfill management, should have been an early priority of the project; however it was not.
After restructuring the situation was corrected through the development of a companion project on methane

capture.
4.2 Outputs by components:
Institutional Strengthening
This component was satisfactory resulting in much greater involvement of the private sector in provision of
services and improved regulations and management systems at the municipal level. In some municipalities,
such as Monterey, significant progress was achieved in the development of sustainable financial and
environmental practices. The specific outputs included: (a) Pre-feasibility and feasibility studies for the
establishment of integrated systems of solid waste management in different municipalities; (b) Development
and review of executive projects for the development of landfills; (c) Master Plans and diagnostic studies
for municipal landfills; (d) Studies to optimize tariff and organizational structure at a landfill operation in
Monterrey, NL; (e) Promotion of the private sector involvement in selected municipalities; (f) Development
of methodological guides to evaluate projects; (g) Development of technical and administrative manuals;
(h) Development of a model for cost recovery; (i) Development of terms of reference for sanitary landfill
construction and environmental impact studies; (I) Training of technicians in 255 municipalities; and (k)
Development of a model system of qualifications, conforming to the requirements of IS09000.
Investment Support for Implementation of Integrated Solid Waste
This component was partially satisfactory. Of the 7 municipalities that were considered for participation in
the project, 3 participated. The investments amounted to US $1.0 million or 38% of the Bank's resources
designated for this purpose. Some of the major reasons for failure of the investments to reach a larger
number of municipalities were: (a) the inability to address the high transaction costs for the funds routed
from the Bank to BANOBRAS to the beneficiaries; and (b) changes in municipal priorities as a result of
changes of administration. These were also some of the causes for the poor performance of the original
investment component. However, several facilities were built that provide a significant body of experience
on modem solid waste management practices. In particular, the landfill in Monterrey, supported through
the project is a state of the art facility and provides a suitable base for the design and implementation of a
methane capture plant. The landfill in Monterrey has also been complemented with a full recycling unit
(not funded by the project) that reduces by about 30% the volume of solid residues reaching the future cells
of the landfill.
Proposed Add-on Project: Methane Gas Capture and Use at a Landfill-Demonstration Project
A GEF project has been developed as an add-on to the Second Solid Waste Management Project. The
project focuses on the development of the technology for the collection of landfill gas and use for energy
production. It will complement and build upon the activities being implemented under the Second Solid
Waste Management Project through provision of financial and technical assistance for: i) introduction of a
cost-effective, demonstrated technology to collect and utilize landfill gas; ii) demonstration of an
institutional structure, which includes private sector participation, under which landfill gas projects can be
implemented; iii) development of federal and municipal capacity for landfill gas collection and use
programs and project implementation; iv) design of a replication strategy for comparable cities in Mexico
and dissemination of lessons from the Mexican experience to other interested parties regionally. The project
was approved by the board in May 2001.

4.5 Institutional development impact:
On the institutional area, the project has had the best results. A study on best practices, undertaken as part
of the institutional component has provided a blueprint of actions needed to further strengthen the capacity
of the municipal institutions to deal with solid waste services (the study is applicable to other municipal
services as well). The study shows that the activities undertaken to strengthen business attitudes,
streamline incentives and provide training and information were essential to improve the record of services
by municipalities. A copy of the study can be found in the project files. Those municipalities that
effectively used the capacity building resources are much more likely to be able to effectively provide solid
waste management, even in the absence of financial resources from the Bank.

The major factor that affected implementation and caused cancellation of the majority of the project was
the economic crisis in Mexico. During the crisis interest rates increased, municipal capacity to borrow was
severely compromised and federal budgets were slashed. These combined to make the investment
component impossible to implement and limited the implementation of the technical assistance component.
The social component for scavengers was cancelled due primarily to the fact that no agreement was reached
at the time with the Government regarding resettlement issues.
Restructured Project
During the time of implementation of the restructured project the municipalities continued to struggle with
restructuring their debt, thus limiting their ability to borrow under the subloans. The cancellation of the
major portion of the loan during the economic crisis left many of the limitations in the sector identified at
appraisal unaddressed. These weaknesses limited implementation of the restructured project.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Government policies and regulations (or lack thereof) limited implementation of the project. In particular:
* The reform of the intergovernmental transfer programs in 1998 (from Ramo 26 to Ramo 33), diluted
the federal involvement in the management of federal resources thus limiting the role of SEDESOL as
originally envisaged in the project.
*   There was no national strategy on solid waste management.
*   The limited regulation at the national, state and local levels also decreased demand for the project and
limited private sector investment.
Additionally, the high turnover at the Municipal level prevented participation of municipalities in the
subprojects. In particular, several subprojects declined participation due to the frequent changes in the
municipal administration (every 3 years) and the associated disruption of the learning curve and change in
priorities. Other municipalities did not have the capacity to meet the subloan conditionalities.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
The Borrower and the Bank were not proactive in recognizing the impact of the economic crisis of 1995 on
the project and sector and failed to take adequate actions to minimize its effect on the project. Design of
the funding mechanism to municipalities was inflexible and consequently, when the recession occurred, the
municipalities could not afford to borrow from BANOBRAS. On the contrary, a more flexible design
whereby grants could be made available to municipalities in addition to sub-loans could have lessened the
impact of the recession on the participation of the municipalities.

5.4 Costs andfinancing:
The total project cost is estimated at $21.01 million representing only 5.1% of the estimated $415.50
million in the SAR. The final dollar costs of the project represent a drastic departure from the SAR
projected figure.This was primarily due to the fact that the component of Investment sub-loans which was
the largest contributor to the total project cost, was reduced from $384.70 million in the original project to
$14.19 million in the revised project due to the recession and consequent restructuring of the project .
Restructuring of the project involved cancellation of $193.06 million from the original loan of $200 million.
In addition the Social component for scavengers was eliminated from the scope of the revised project.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationalefor sustainability rating:
The overall rating for sustainability is unlikelv. Under the prevalent financial environment, the standard
conditionalities for lines of credit will not work. The conditionalities of the financing mechanism are rigid
and the terms stipulated were unattractive to the municipalities at the time the resources were available.
These problems will prevent the project from continuing in a sustainable manner. This is underscored by
the fact that the ability of the project to disburse funds and to realize the objectives mainly of a major
component of the project was greatly hampered. Still, the need for investments in infrastructure remains
unmet. In order for these needs to be addressed, the private sector should play a much more relevant role
accessing financial resources in the domestic market or through partnerships with parties from abroad. In
this respect, the international carbon market could play an important part in making investments in landfills
financially viable. This should be explored through the replication component of the recently approved
Methane project.  Capturing the market for global environmental services will contribute to the
sustainability of investments in the solid waste management sector.
If the regulatory changes identified during the project (modifications to NOM-084) are enacted, future
landfills will be designed taking into account the potential for landfill gas recovery.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
It is expected that the benefits of the Technical Assistance component of the project will be sustained and
will contribute positively towards the transition to regular operations.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
The project was not able to channel most of the lending funds. In this respect the overall performance for
the investment component as originally designed was unsatisfactory. However, the reasons for the poor
performance were of a structural nature and could not have been addressed through the project. The
restructuring of the project, initiated by the Bank, largely addressed this difficulty through a rebalancing of
the interventions to be fiuded, giving more relevance to the institutional and regulatory aspects. The Bank
did perform in terms of facilitating information and prompting the identification of potential borrowers but
the project was originally overdesigned.
7.2 Supervision:
The Bank did a satisfactory job in supervising the project. However, the restructuring should have been
done much earlier, as soon as the reasons for non performance of the investment component were identified.
-9-



In this respect, the supervision efforts should have led to an earlier action by the Bank and the Borrower.
The intensity of supervision missions was under the average before the restructuring (Fost interest?). After
the restructuring however, the frequency of supervision missions was increased and a much better
communication with beneficiaries (individual municipalities) was established.
7.3 Overall Bankperformance:
Overall, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, with a much improved rating after the
restructuring was approved.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The Borrower effectively participated in the preparation. Some questions however remain on the extent to
which the financial intermediary was cognizant of the efforts required at a retail level to channel the
financial resources.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
Satisfactory
7.6 Implementing Agency:
Satisfactory
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Satisfactory
8. Lessons Learned
Support for technical and financial viability studies are necessary to identify priority projects.
Training and technical assistance for administration and operation of municipal public services are
necessary before municipalities are expected to assume responsibilities under new legal and regulatory
policies.
Social development policies including social action plans should be mainstreamed into infrastructure
financing programs and included as a criteria for approval.
Financing should be channelled to encourage the development of responsible decentralized organizations
and provide incentives for the management of municipal public services in the form of a concession.
Bank should focus on recognizing and addressing the particular needs of scavenger communities and
undertake careful analysis to determine if the Bank's resettlement policies should be applied.
Good coordination between the sub-project financing agency and the agency providing technical assistance
to the municipalities is necessary.
Technical and social assessments should be carried out in an integrated manner and in consultation with the
scavenger communities.
The responsibility for bearing the costs of social action plans should be clearly defined among central

government, municipalities and local organizations.
Basic weaknesses of municipal organizations such as limited capacity and lack of continuity between
municipal administrations need to be addressed in order to achieve lasting improvements in the sector.
