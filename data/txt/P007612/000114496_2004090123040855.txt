                    Agreement
Dear Sirs:
          Please refer to the Loan Agreement between
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the
Bank) and Banco Nacional de Obras y Servicios Publicos,
S.N.C. (the Borrower) dated October 2, 1994 (the Loan
Agreement), as amended, entered into with respect to the
above-captioned Project.  We are pleased to inform you that,
pursuant to your request and our recent discussions on the
subject, the Bank agrees to amend said Loan Agreement as
follows so as to permit application of the Unidad de
Inversion (UDI) mechanism to contractual arrangements and
Subloans entered into pursuant to said Project:
LOAN AGREEMENT
1.  Section 3.01 of the Loan Agreement is hereby amended by
inserting a new paragraph (c) immediately after paragraph (b)
thereof so as to read as follows in its entirety:
"Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this
Agreement or in the Guarantee Agreement, the Borrower shall
cause the contractual arrangements referred to in this
Section to be irrevocably amended so as to require all of the
following (but solely with respect to such Loan proceeds
(hereinafter Affected Proceeds as more specifically labeled
below) which have been or may be onlent by the Guarantor to
the Borrower pursuant to said contractual arrangements to
cover amounts disbursed by the Borrower to Participating
Municipalities (or their States when such States are the
borrowers of the Subloans) under:  (I) non-Unidad de
Inversion (Investment Unit; hereinafter UDI)-denominated
Subloans, but are due to be repaid to the Guarantor after
said Subloans become UDI-denominated Subloans (hereinafter
UDI-repayable Affected Proceeds); or (II) UDI-denominated
Subloans (hereinafter UDI-disbursable Affected Proceeds)):
(i)  that such amendment shall have one or more effective
     dates, that of such dates one shall be applicable to the
     Affected Proceeds of each UDI-denominated Subloan and
     that for each UDI-denominated Subloan such date shall be
     the amendment date referred to in paragraph 6 (a) (i) of
     Schedule 5 to this Agreement (hereinafter the Benchmark
     Date);
(ii) that all Affected Proceeds be redenominated from pesos
     to UDIs as of the Benchmark Date for said Affected
     Proceeds according to the peso/UDI conversion rate
Page  2
     applicable to that date as published in the Guarantor's
     Diario Oficial (Official Gazette);
(iii) that the UDI-disbursable Affected Proceeds
      redenominated pursuant to paragraph (c) (ii) of this
      Section be disbursed by the Guarantor to the Borrower in
      pesos according to the peso/UDI conversion rate
      applicable to the date of disbursement as published in
      the Guarantor's Diario Oficial, be repaid and have
      interest charged thereon according to the terms of
      paragraphs (c) (v) and (c) (vi) of this Section but in
      all other respects be governed by the terms of the
      contractual arrangements as they read prior to their
      amendment allowed pursuant to this paragraph (c);
(iv) that the UDI-repayable Affected Proceeds redenominated
     pursuant to paragraph (c) (ii) of this Section be repaid
     and have interest charged thereon according to the terms
     of paragraphs (c) (v) and (c) (vi) of this Section but
     in all other respects be governed by the terms of the
     contractual arrangements as they read prior to their
     amendment allowed pursuant to this paragraph (c);
(v)  that all the Borrower's principal repayments to the
     Guarantor with respect to an UDI-denominated Subloan's
     Affected Proceeds be made in pesos, the amount of which
     shall be determined by adjusting for the difference in
     the value of the UDI between the Benchmark Date for such
     Affected Proceeds and the date of repayment by the
     Borrower, all as set forth in the Decreto por el que se
     establecen las obligaciones que podran denominarse en
     Unidades de Inversion (Decree establishing obligations
     that may be denominated in Investment Units) published
     in the Guarantor's Diario Oficial on April 1, 1995 (for
     purposes of the adjustment referred to herein, a repaid
     amount shall be applied to cancel the earliest
     outstanding disbursed amount); and
(vi) that all the Borrower's interest payments to the
     Guarantor on outstanding disbursed Affected Proceeds be
     made in pesos at a variable rate equal at the time of
     the interest payment to a publicly-quoted market-
     determined interest rate, satisfactory to the Bank and
     to be specified in the contractual arrangements, on UDI-
     denominated government bonds, except that, until a
     market to determine such rates is established, the
     applicable variable rate shall be equal at the time of
     the interest payment to the tasa real (real rate)
     calculated according to the formula set forth in the
     November 1, 1995 Oficio 305.-269/95 from the Guarantorþs
     Director General de Credito Publico of the Secretaria de
     Hacienda y Credito Publico to the Borrowerþs Director
     General.".
2.  Schedule 5 to the Loan Agreement is hereby amended by
inserting a new paragraph 6 immediately after the end of
paragraph 5 thereof so as to read as follows in its entirety:
"(a) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this
Agreement or in the Guarantee Agreement, the Borrower may,
with the agreement of the Participating Municipality (or its
State when such State is the borrower of the Subloan) and of
all other parties, if any, to a Subloan Agreement, amend such
Subloan Agreement (in no case prior to April 4, 1995) so as
to require all of the following:
(i)  that all Subloan amounts covered by said Subloan
     Agreement, which remain undisbursed from the Borrower to
     the Participating Municipality (or its State when such
     State is the borrower of the Subloan) or have been
     disbursed but not repaid, be redenominated from pesos to
     Unidades de Inversion (Investment Units; hereinafter
     UDIs) as of the date of such amendment according to the
Page  3
     peso/UDI conversion rate applicable to that date as
     published in the Guarantor's Diario Oficial (Official
     Gazette);
(ii) that the undisbursed Subloan amounts redenominated
     pursuant to subparagraph (a) (i) of this paragraph be
     disbursed in pesos according to the peso/UDI conversion
     rate applicable to the date of disbursement as published
     in the Guarantor's Diario Oficial, be repaid and have
     interest charged thereon according to the terms of
     subparagraphs (a) (iv) and (a) (v) of this paragraph but
     in all other respects be governed by the terms of the
     original Subloan Agreement as it read prior to its
     amendment allowed pursuant to this paragraph (a);
(iii) that the disbursed but not repaid Subloan amounts
      redenominated pursuant to subparagraph (a) (i) of this
      paragraph be repaid and have interest charged thereon
      according to the terms of subparagraphs (a) (iv) and (a)
      (v) of this paragraph but in all other respects be
      governed by the terms of the original Subloan Agreement
      as it read prior to its amendment allowed pursuant to
      this paragraph (a);
(iv) that all the Participating Municipalityþs (or its
     Stateþs when such State is the borrower of the Subloan)
     principal repayments to the Borrower with respect to the
     UDI-denominated Subloan be made in pesos, the amount of
     which shall be determined by adjusting for the
     difference in the value of the UDI between the date of
     the amendment referred to in subparagraph (a) (i) of
     this paragraph and the date of repayment by the
     Participating Municipality (or its State when such State
     is the borrower of the Subloan), all as set forth in the
     Decreto por el que se establecen las obligaciones que
     podran denominarse en Unidades de Inversion (Decree
     establishing obligations that may be denominated in
     Investment Units) published in the Guarantor's Diario
     Oficial on April 1, 1995; and
(v)  that all the Participating Municipality's (or its
     State's when such State is the borrower of the Subloan)
     interest payments to the Borrower on outstanding
     disbursed UDI-denominated Subloan proceeds be made in
     pesos at a variable rate equal at the time of the
     interest payment to a publicly-quoted market-determined
     interest rate, satisfactory to the Bank and to be
     specified in the Subloan Agreement, on UDI-denominated
     government bonds (plus a percentage point spread equal
     to no less than 2.5 percentage points), except that,
     until a market to determine such rates is established,
     the applicable variable rate shall be equal at the time
     of the interest payment to the tasa real (real rate)
     calculated according to the formula set forth in the
     November 1, 1995 Oficio 305.-269/95 from the Guarantor's
     Director General de Credito Publico of the Secretaria de
     Hacienda y Credito Publico to the Borrowerþs Director
     General (again plus a percentage point spread equal to
     no less than 2.5 percentage points).
(b)   Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this
Agreement or in the Guarantee Agreement, the Borrower may
enter into new, as yet unamended Subloan Agreements for UDI-
denominated Subloans which contain the disbursement,
repayment and interest provisions set forth in subparagraphs
(a) (ii), (a) (iv) and (a) (v) of this paragraph, but only if
the remaining provisions of said new Subloan Agreements are
consistent with the terms of this Schedule as relate to
Subloans not denominated in UDIs.".

amendments by signing and dating this letter in the spaces
