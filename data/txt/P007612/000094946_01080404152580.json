The economic\n            crisis in Mexico affected project implementation and caused\n            cancellation of the majority of the project. The\n            restructured project focused on institutional strengthening,\n            training, and dissemination, as well as limited subproject\n            finance. In addition to the achievements of the restructured\n            project objectives, the project facilitated and paved the\n            way for the demonstration project for Methane gas capture\n            and use at a landfill. Also, due to the project, there has\n            been considerable private sector interest and willingness to\n            engage in management of solid waste in municipalities."}, "docdt": "2001-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
