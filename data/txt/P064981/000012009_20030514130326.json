groundwater in the Sana'a\n            Basin aquifer, a timing which will allow for the conversion\n            of the Basin's economy into less water-intensive\n            activities, while favorable socioeconomic conditions will be\n            encouraged through community participation. The first\n            component seeks to achieve water savings, and conservation\n            in agriculture, by increasing irrigation uses through\n            physical interventions in upgrading piped delivery systems,\n            converting open channels to piped delivery systems, and\n            introducing pressurized irrigation, promoting community\n            participation. The second component will accelerate\n            groundwater recharge, through small conventional dams,\n            sub-surface dams, and other structures. Given the flaws of\n            the Water Law, the third component will help develop a\n            regulatory framework, to subsequently apply regulatory\n            procedures for water rights management, and, the National\n            Water Resources Authority will assume the responsibility for\n            basin-wide water resources investigation, regulation, and\n            monitoring. Moreover, a basin hydro-geological and water\n            resources investigation, and monitoring will aim at\n            analyzing project impacts on dam, and wadi structures\n            regarding aquifer recharge, and groundwater levels,\n            including as well, surveys, laboratory testing, and\n            satellite imagery/aerial photography to quantify impacts on\n            crops and irrigated areas. The fourth, fifth and sixth\n            components, will promote public awareness campaigns,\n            environmental management, and mitigation plans, and, support\n            project management activities, respectively."}, "docdt": "2003-04-23T00:00:00Z"}
