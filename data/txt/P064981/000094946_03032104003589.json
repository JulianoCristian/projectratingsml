(RECIPIENT-EXECUTED)", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The environmental and social issues\n            raised by the Sana'a Basin water management Program\n            Project for the republic of Yemen are grouped as follows:\n            design issues, including siting; construction issues,\n            especially for dams; operational issues; dam safety issues;\n            sustainability issues, especially water quality; pesticide\n            issues; health issues; wastewater treatment plant issues;\n            and resettlement issues. The objective of rehabilitating\n            existing dams is itself a mitigation measure to address\n            safety hazards. A dam safety expert has visited all sites\n            and preliminarily concluded that the sites and foreseen work\n            would not pose any safety risk. However, an international\n            expert will also be retained to review feasibility studies,\n            final designs, and bidding documents, and to participate in\n            the Mid-Term Review. Recommended non-structural safety\n            measures include installing instrumentation and monitoring\n            devices, operation and maintenance plans, including\n            emergency preparedness plans, and establishing a panel of\n            three national experts, who would supervise final designs\n            and safety measures. During construction, work areas\n            susceptible to erosion will not remain exposed for long\n            periods and sites will be restored to their original\n            contours and revegetated where directed; shoring will be\n            provided if needed in deeper trenches to ensure worker\n            safety; reduce noise by scheduling work during the daytime;\n            water worksites, quarries, and access roads to suppress\n            dust; provide controls to concrete and batching plants to\n            reduce air pollution and pollution of surface and\n            groundwater; distance fueling from watercourses or recharge\n            areas; put controls in place to prevent spillage; and have\n            contractors clean up any accidental spills; employ strict\n            measures for transport, storage, and use of explosives.\n            Where there are archeological finds, cease construction\n            until appropriate procedures for removal or preservation are\n            issued; transplant any rare or endangered species to safe\n            locations; to ensure worker health and safety, provide them\n            safe drinking water and sanitation facilities, suitable\n            clothing, first aid posts, and training in safe work\n            practices. While the consumption of qat, the predominant\n            crop in the Sana'a Basin, raises serious political,\n            social, and public health issues, and its reduction is\n            beyond the scope of this project, its consumption could be\n            made less risky with measures to minimize pesticide\n            residues. This report recommends demonstrating a model\n            integrated pest management plan, regular testing for\n            pesticide residues and farmer education, and monitoring of\n            groundwater quality. There is some danger that the project\n            works will increase the prevalence of schistosomiasis (or\n            bilharzias). In that case, water bodies close to human\n            habitations will be regularly inspected and monitored\n            monthly to detect and identify the breeding of vectors and\n            contain any colonies found through controlled spraying of\n            insecticides and molluscicides. A specialist will oversee\n            heath education and control measures. As for wastewater\n            treatment plant issues, the accumulated dried sludge will be\n            removed to a landfill site; a \"red flag\" system\n            will warn farmers when raw sewage is being bypassed; a\n            farmers will be educated on the hazards of treated and\n            untreated wastewater; and a ban placed on the use of\n            effluent to irrigate vegetables eaten raw."}, "docdt": "2003-01-15T00:00:00Z"}
