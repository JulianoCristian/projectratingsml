Annex 1. Field Study Regarding Biodiversity and Cultural Heritage
Introduction
Taking into consideration certam criteria, which include hydrological fcatures, supply
structures, irrigation demand and groundwater abstraction and socioeconomic aspects, four
areas were iutlally selected as possible potential sites for dam construction. These areas are
I   Western area (Hamdan and Bani Matar) This area covers sub-basins 14 and 15
2 Southeast area (Sanhan and Bani Bahloul) This area covers the sub-basm 19
3. Eastern area (Barn Hushaish and Bani Al-Harith). Thls area covers sub-basin 11, 12,
17 and north-east part of 9
4 Northeast area (Nihm and Arhab) This area covers sub-basins 5, 6 and part of 3
Eight possible sites were selected to construct new dams Thesc sites are located m the
western, eastern, and north-eastern areas However, only three of these sites will be given
priority during stage I of the project The eight sites are
5   Shicb Al-Mac'dc, Nihm - project site
6 Ban! cAbdillah, Nihm - dropped from project
7   Al-Mal5h/ near Al-Hmami, Bani Hushaysh - project site
8   As-Sin/ near Abi cAll, Bani Hushaysh - project site
9 Al-'Awrd/ near Darwan, Hamdan - dropped from project
10 Sa'ilat Al-cUqlah, Arhab - dropped from project
11   Bahman/ near Al-Jabbaylah, Nihm - project site
12 Wadi Hijrah, Bani Hushaysh - dropped from project
These arcas were visited during July 2001. An additional site - Bait Shaiban - was added to
the project works during the course of the EIA and was visited later by the EIA team, findings
on this site are reported on page 10 The findings of the environmental team on the eight
original sites are set out below
Other sites for later consideration are
1   Wadi Mukhtan, Ban! Hushaysh
2   Al-Qaratil, Bayt Ncam, Hamdan
Findings Regarding Biodiversity (by Dr. Abdel Karim Nasher, Biodiversity Specialist)
Eastern Area
This area was visited twice on 12 and 13 July 2001 The first one was made to an existing
dam in Bani Hushaish, namely Wadi Mukhtan Dam, which is located at N 150 22' 49", E 440
19' 43", alt 2400 masl There was plenty of water in the reservoir However, a good number
of plants was growing on the hillsides and were not affected by the large amount of water No
mosquitoes were seen breeding in the water. The common plants were Kanahla lanifolia,
Fagonia sp., Argemone mexicana ,and Aervajavanica A few plants of Citrullus colocynthis,
which is used locally for the treatment of skm itch and dermatitis, were seen near the dam
site. Also, Lavandula pubescens, used as an infusion for heartburn, was also seen growmg in
tlus area Despite the fact that these plants are used "occasionally" by people, they are not of
importance from the conservation point of view, and are not endangered species
Since vertebrate animals are generally shy and hide away in the presence of humans, the only
one seen was Agama yemenenszs, a common agamid lizard all over the country A small
1



stream was seen in the village, a few hundred meters from the dam It was full of Bufo
tadpoles, leeches and larvae and pupae of Simulium ruficorne All of these are not harmful,
and apparently were present m the area before the dam was constructed. There are a lot of
agricultural fields in this area, and most people grow qat and grape vines
The second visit was to the site of Al-Milah, near Al-Hinami village The suggested site for
the dam is suitable. It is a mountainous area, and the wadi contains small rocks and pebbles
No plants of conservation value were seen There were a few weeds which mcluded
Centaurea sp., Aerva javanhca, Lavandula puezscens, and Chenopodium sp No vertebrate
ammals were seen in this area However the people claim that there are many carnivores
which attack their livestock and chicken at night These are possibly wolves, jennets and
foxes People in and around this village are engaged in agriculture The most common crop is
qat, and grapes come m the second place. Construction of a dam m this site does not seem to
have a negative impact, as there are no rare and endangered plants growing m the wadi
On 26 July 2001, Bahman area was visited The suggested site for dam construction is a
narrow gorge located at N 150 31' 53" E 440 27' 47" (alt 2459 meters above sea level) This
wadi receives a large amount of water during the rainy season Most of the plants growing in
and around the wadi are weeds of no conservation value. A few trees of wild fig Ficus sp
were seen growing on the sides of the wadi. The most common herbaceous plants are Dipcadi
veride, Echmnops sp, Solanum incanum, Fagonia sp, Boerhavia sp, Puhcaria sp, Fagonia
sp and a few grass species A single plant of the succulent Klernia pendula was seen growmg
on the wadi side A few Aloe sp Plants were also seen. No animals were seen at the time of
the visit However, the inhabitants of the area claim that foxes are common in the area, and
they appear at night
On 31 July 2001, a visit was made to Al Hijra village. The suggested site for the dam is
located at N 15° 31' 46" E 440 34' 55", altitude 2410 meters above sea level The most
important plants growing in the area include Caralluma petraea, succulent Euphorbia sp , and
Dipcadi veride Common weeds of no conservation value were various grass species, Fagoni
sp, Sonchus sp, Tagetes minuta, and Pujicaria sp There were several fields of qat in the
bottom of the wadi These will defintely be affected and will be flooded if a dam is to be
constructed there Therefore, it is very important to bear in mind the problem of compensating
the farmers m this area.
Northeast Area-
On 19 July 2001, the team visited Nihm on the north eastern part of the basin Two sites
proposed for construction of new dams were visited The first is located near Shib-al-Maadi
village (N 15° 43' 24" E44° 27' 51", alt. 2047 masl). The site proposed for the dam
construction is near a rocky plateau, mainly limestone rocks Two plant species, Acacia sp
and Ziziphus spina-christi can be seen growmg in the bottom of the wadi The wood of the
first plant is used as fuel and the leaves are consumed by camels The wood of Ziziphus is
used by the locals in house construction and the fruits are edible These trees, which make a
small population in the wadi, will be destroyed when the dam is constructed The most
important plants from conservation point of view are Euphorbia balsimefera, Euphorbia sp,
Caralluma spp and Aloe sp
Vcry few lizards of Agama sp. were seen in the area The people who responded to the
questionnaire said that wolves, foxes and hyenas are also found People in the area are
engaged in agriculture where they grow qat, grapes There are also a few orchards where
some fruit trees are grown
This is now a moot point, since this site has been dropped from the project
2



The Acacia and Ziziphus plants growing in the wadi constitute a small population of these
two species compared to the populations growing elsewhere m the village, which will not be
affected by the dam Other plants growing in the area are weeds of no conservation
importance These are Aerva javanica, Calatropis procera, Solanum incanum, Lavandula
dentate and some grasses which have no conservation value
The second site is located near the mountainous village of Bani Abdullah The main activity
of the people is growmg qat. Very few vine fields were seen The suggested site for the dam
(N 150 31' 55" E 440 26" 02", alt 2364 masl) lies in a relatively narrow wadi with sparse
vegetation. The few plant species growing there were weeds of no conservation value Only
Agama lizards were seen in the wadi. However, people claim that snakes and monitor lizards
are also found m the area
On 31 July 2001, Az-Zubairy village in Arhab was visited The proposed site for the dam
(Sailat al Oqla) is located at N 15o 35' 13" E 44o 20' 51", altitude 2184 meters above sea
level. It is a narrow wadi with sandy/rocky bed It has a high potential for absorbing water
efficiently There are several Acacia trees growing at the sides of the wadi, which are likely to
be affected if the dam is constructed. The most important plants from conservation point of
view are Dipcadi veride and Caralluma spp No animals were seen during the time of the
visit, but the inhabitants claim that hyenas, wolves, and foxes are frequently seen in the arca

*    Shicb Al-Macadi, Nlhm
*   The dam site is located in a wadi bed in a limestone rock formation
*   No habitation or dwellmgs of any sort are found. No irrigation structures or
agricultural terraces are found
*   No visible sign of potential cultural importance of the site.
*   The site is not part of any known folk tradition or practice
DAM SITE 2 (Bami cAbdillah):
*   N15031'55"E44026'02" alt. 2,364 masl

newly constructed terraces at the wadi bed of newly reclaimed agricultural land
*   No visible sign of potential cultural importance of the site
*   The site is not part of any known folk tradition or practice
*   Not far away from the site downstream, there exist simple single-room structures
constructed side by side in an overhanging hollow rock formation on the wadi side
These rooms are used now by the farmers to store fine clay used to dust plants (a
traditional way for plant protection against certam diseases) This place is curiously
named Juruf as-Salat-m literally meaning Caves of the Sultans, which may suggest
special importance of the site2
Also a moot point, as this site is no longer in the project

Findings on the Bait Shaiban Site (biodiversity and cultural heritage)
The Bait Shaiban site (also known as Thajer) is located in the Nihm district The nearest
upstream village is Hawrah and down stream the village of Bait Shalban Approximately one-
third of the cultivable land in the areas surrounding the villages is farmed, mainly qat and
some fruit trees and grape irrigated from open wells The proposed dam site lies in a remote,
shallow, fairly narrow and gently sloping wadi, with sparse vegetation, mainly grasses, weeds
and scrub No flora species of conservation interest were noted No animals, other than a few
lizards, were seen during the time of the visit but local inhabitants report that foxes are
frequently seen in the area No sites of architcctural or cultural importance were seen The
dam would not affect any buildings or cultivation

the project9
5 What are the key issues to be addressed in the environmental assessment and do the
terms of reference reflect these issues?
Brief Summary of Working Groups' Findings and Recommendations
A. Responses and recommendations arising from specific questions:
Group 1. Public Health, Domestic Water, Irrigation and Wastewater Reuse
Water Quality Benefits Water mming and evaporation will be decreased
Water Quality Concerns Salinity / high evaporation may be increased
Water Availability Benefits Deep aquifers will be preserved and promotion of wastewater
reuse will ease increase water availability
Pollution Benefits Wastewater treatment will be improved thereby reducing pollution
Pollution Concerns. Run off from untreated wastes may form sources of pollution
Sanitation Benefits Promotion of household samtation will improve environment and
public health
Wastewater and Sludge Reuse Benefits: Improvements to Sana'a wastewater treatment
plant's effluent, which is used for irrigation, will improve environment and public health
Pests and Pesticides Benefits. Adoption of integrated pest management plan, improvement
of environment and public health
Solid Wastes Management Benefits Public awareness campaign will reduce dumping and
improve the environment
Conjunctive Water Use benefits Increased water availability for household and personal
use will improve public health
15



Group 2. Dams and Sam Safety
Benefits Groundwater recharge and water availability for irrigation Reduction of
dam failure risk and secured benefits
Issues Poor dam maintenance / repair and lack of safety inspection Possible need for
resettlement and land acquisition which will impact on traditional systems Voluntary
contribution may be required Weak institutional capacity in GDI and other
organization such as NWRA Groundwater recharge benefits may be offset by
evaporation
Group 3. Biodiversity & Cultural Heritage
Concerns re Flora. Some succulents are very rare (i e Carulluma) and should be
transplanted to new sites
Concerns re Fauna Reptiles and rodents should not pose a problem in small dam sites,
however, some snail vectors breed in dams and eggs survive dry periods, biological
control should be investigated
Benefits re Blodiversity Creating water bodies can have positive impact on birds and other
species and flora
Benefits Preservation of historic sites and buildmgs, and restoration and rehabilitation of
neglected cisterns and irrigation systems
Concerns Loss of structures, cisterns, terraces, and watch towers etc, and damage to
religious buildmgs, rural grounds and other social and culturally important sites (spaces),
although this was thought to be minimal
B. Responses and Recommendations Arising from General Questions:
2 What are the best social and institutional arrangements to ensure that the benefits of the
project are realized by the community and that potential issues are addressed?
"At the community level Local Councils, Water Users Associations should be involved
and awareness campaigns mounted in schools and clinics etc
At the higher level. capacity builduig m EPC and GDI for monitoring is required, plus a
registration and licensing system for water pumping should be introduced"
3. Have all the key stakeholders been identified, or who has been omitted'
"Stakeholders to be involved are NGOs, farmers associations, big farmers, share croppers,
women, local leaders/local councils, social support groups, private sector, Government
(EPC, GDI, MOH, NWRA). Dam safety should be one of the focal points for Government
involvement"
4 What are your recommendations for future consultations and public disclosure regarding
the project'
"Increase consultation in the field, use media to promote project, use focus groups and one
to one interviews, use women as entry points, promote inter-community field visits Public
awareness campaign and mechanism for grievances".
16



5 What are the Main Issues to be addressed in the EIA and are these covered in the EIA
TOR?
Consensus on issues to be addressed:
Dam safety
Public Health (including household water supply, sanitation and the Sana'a WWTP)
Biodiversity
Cultural Heritage
Pesticides
Monitoring water quantity and quality
Promotion and involvement of women
It was agreed that the EIA TOR generally covered the above issues, but that they
should be refined to ensure their comprehensiveness.

Annex 5. Summary of the Stakeholders Meetings
Main Issues for Stakeholders Meetings
A realistic evaluation of the situation and identification of specific problems that may be
particular to any basin requires a direct involvement of all concerned stakeholders / users
Information collected through meetmgs with such parties is usually the 'safeguard' for the
success of any action plan for water resources management. Important issues relevant to the
situation in the Sana'a Basin were identified, as described in Annex 4 Specific issues to be
discussed during the stakeholders meetings and a provisional question l1st for this purpose is
given in Table 5 3
Main Outcome of the Meetings
Main Issues:
Main issues that appeared to be of most concern to all stakeholder groups are summarized as
follows
1  Groundwater depletion scarcity: This was raised by all groups as the most serious
problem affecting all districts Several evidences were cited including
*  In Wadi RUjam - Sa'awan shallow hand-dug wells ( - 15m deep) were most
common m the past Farmers began to deepen these wells to - 30m in 1972
usmg local metal tools known as "Suppayr", until modern drlling techniques
were introduced in the late 1970s From early 1980 onwards, a significant
drop in water level was observed such that the average well depth ranged
between 200-250 meters Now most boreholes are 2 400m deep and the
"water reservoir" is still gettmg deeper and deeper
*  In Hamdan, there are large number of wells which are being over-pumped in
a manner that, according to one farmer, is likely to be disastrous unless quick
and effective measures are taken.
*  Arhab district is practically a mountainous zone devoid of groundwater
resources except for 4 or 5 areas, as a result of which many locals migrate to
Sana'a City because of lack of fresh water for drmking
*  In Bamn Al-Harith, many farmers started rehabilitatng catchment areas for
agriculture purposes by using surface flow/flood water that used to either
recharge the shallow aquifer or benefit downstream users As a result, more
and more users are drilling boreholes that tap the deeper aqulfer system
*  In Sanhan-Bam Bahloul, there is a drastic change in groundwater use where
practically very few shallow dug wells (known locally as Yousufi wells)
existed in the near past whereas deep boreholes are now spreading across the
district in a frightening manner In the Bani Bahloul, part of this district, the
inhabitants of Bait Uqb village had to abandon their wells as the depth of
findmg groundwater has reached 500-800 meters
2. Inadequate infrastructure: A good number of water harvesting structures (small
dams, reservoirs, ponds, etc ) have been constructed through public/private
cooperative efforts and funds However, many of them have totally collapsed Those
that still exist are in poor shape due mainly to lack of financial resources and/or
proper maintenance Specific examples given by the participants include.
In Sanahan-Bani Bahloul, construction of the Hamal Dam, constructed by the
locals as a good means of aquifer recharge, is now abandoned
19



*  In Hamdan, a reservoir dam was built in Tawthan area long time ago for
collecting rainwater but the locals are not benefiting from it apparently
because "the water dinltrates deep through the rocks"
*  In Bani Al-Harith, there is an ideal location for a dam in Al-Ushsha east of
Bayt-Doudah in Al-Baahuh that the locals would like to be considered as a
potential site within this study.
*  In Sanhan-Bani Bahloul, there are a number of suitable sites for dams such as
Al-Qushaybah area, which is known to have good catchment characteristics
.  In Nihm, there is substantial quantities of surface water that flows out
towards Wadi Al-Jawf and that could be utilized by the locals for irrigation if
proper dams and/or other water-retaimng structures
*  In Arhab, there are a number of reservoirs for water harvesting m different
areas, some in good shape while others need rehabilitation
*  In Nihm, there are two dams (Shayban and Hatha) that could not be
completed due to lack of resources
*  Two other sites that are considered important for the population in both
Arhab and Nihm are
> Musayreka plain in the foothills of Jabal Sama', and
' Al-Kharid spring area, which could also be used for supplying the
urban population in Sana'a with fresh water.
3  Dishonesty of the Government: All parties, without exception, expressed a great
anxiety and mistrust m the Government with regards to seriousness in alleviating the
water-related problems that exist in their districts. It appeared that most of those
present did not deal with NWRA, or even hear about it Rather, the negative feeling
expressed was mainly engraved in them over many years of contacts with NWRA and
the MAI, particularly the irrigation bodies attached to the latter mainly the Directorate
of Irrigation and the ACU Specific issues/incidents that were raised in relation to this
institutional aspect mclude
*  Representatives from Bani Al-Harith expresscd their anger mamly through
the performance of NWSA, which they regard as a complete lack of concern
for the local population in this district They summarized their grief in the
following points, all related to environmental aspects
>  Continuous discharge of sewerage into their cultivatcd lands and
nearby wadi channel for 15 years
>  Construction of treatment plant recently without any consideration
for building a separate plant for the solid waste
>  Inefficient operation of the new plant in a continuous manner as a
result of which huge quantities of accumulated waste gets suddenly
released to inundate the cultivated crop and human health
degradation.
>  Lack of proper canal system to discharge the wastewater such that
the local can make use of it while at the same time not being
subjected to its harmful effects
>  Total absence of any activities to fight disease-carrying insects that
appeared as a result of the wastewater discharge.
>  Lack of Government response to the local populations' need for
municipal water despite the fact that several boreholes have been
drilled for this purpose, which only require the installation of
distribution system
*  Representatives from the other districts expressed mamly their frustrations
with Government officials (urban inhabitants) who "always promise but
20



never do anything for the rural areas". The following expressions were often
thrown from different persons
>  Farmers simply do not feel that anything positive will come out of
the current meetmgs as nothing have materialized from similar
meetings in the past.
> Government officials, particularly those involved m projects
implementations, "should first respect their words and we are ready
to fully cooperate with them "
>  We should not think only about how to get new water supply
sources for the city, but also about the rural population, such that
an action, such as building dams, could benefit both population
groups
>  There are certam powerful social groups/mdividuals with strong
links to the Government (e g the Irrigation Cooperative, Sheikhs,
etc ) who monopolize the water-related issues, hence the
implementation of any activity withm the context of this project
should be through direct contact with the mam beneficiaries
Perceived Solutions
There was a strong consensus that dams construction/rehabilitation, adoption of modern
irrigation systems and implementation of an intensive public awareness program in the rural
area are the main solutions (in this order) Specific details relevant to thcse proposed actions
mcluded.
  Construction of surface reservoirs and other water-retaining structures in the
ideal solution for alleviating some of the pressure from the aquifer system
*  Recharge dams have proven effectiveness in several areas (e g Mukhtan in
Bani Hushaysh) and the experience learned should be taken into
*  Let us start first with the rehabilitation of the numerous different structures
scattered in the various districts, usmg local material (known as Al-Qudad)
that has proven effectiveness and endurity We can then evaluate the
feasibility of resuming construction of incomplete works while at the same
time planmng for new ones
*  Planning for any new dams/structures should be in accordance with actual
needs in each region rather than satisfying or pleasing certam tribe or social
groups
*  Selection of sites should be based on careful and scientific analysis and
approach
  All farmers are willmg to adopt using modem irrigation methods but first Ict
the Government convmce us that it actually works as an effective water-
saving mechanism without affectmg crop yield
Specific Issues:
A number of issues raised during the meeting were either zone-specific problems, or
expressed interesting opinions that reflected on the farmers perceptions stemming from their
own point of views on the futurc of the region. Among the first category were the following
Environmental and Water Quality Monitoring in Bam Al-Harith
It is clear from the information given above that pollution issues related to the
current practice of wastewater disposal is spreading m Bani Al-Harith
Participants from this district put forward some interesting suggestions for
handling the situation
21



>  Continuous monitoring on the wastewater treatment plant
operations to ensure that water discharged from the plant is clean
and suitable for irrigation use
>   Discharge of hydrocarbon-based pollutants mto wadi channel,
particularly oil and other lubricants discharged from gas station and
car-wash workshops, should be closely monitored and controlled
by forcing these places to put all such materials in special
tanks/barrels to be collected later on regular basis and stored in
properly-sealed reservoirs.
> Any such monitoring programs are likely to be ineffective if local
inhabitants from the district are not involved directly.
* Heavy Reliance Rainfed Irrigation in Sanhan - Bani Bahloul About 60% of
the farmers m these two districts, officially combined into one still live on
ram-fed cultivation along major wadis. Among the most common problems
affecting crop yields (and hence water-use efficiency) are soil/land erosion
and infectious diseases due to heavy attack by plant insects Effective
rehabilitation measurers are therefore urgently needed
*  Concentration of Dams Construction in Nthm and Bani Hushaysh - Khawlan
A good number of dams have been constructed m Nihm as well as Bani
Hushaysh - Khawlan districts, mostly through cooperative efforts with public
and/or private money. In Nihm, the main aim behmd constructmg these dams
was surface water retention while those in Bam-Hushaysh-Khawlan were
both for retention as well as recharge purposes. Of particular importance with
respect to the situation In the latter region is the heavy role that the
Agricultural Cooperative Union (ACU) has played through the Cooperative
Society for Irrigation and Hydraulic Structures This society has been
involved in the construction of three recharge dams (two in Mukhtan, one
existing and another under construction plus a proposed one (in As Sarf
area)) and three reservoirs (one each in Wadi Sa'awan, As sir, and Ash
Sharya area)
*  The Need of Galvamzed Pipes m Hamdan   Most areas in this district are
mountainous such that many farmlands are cultivated on almost barren rocks
with very limited soil cover Experience has shown that the construction of
modern irrigation systems using polyethylene pipes is not suitable for this
terram Hence, any future development in the area should consider
galvanized (metal) pipes.
*  High Rock Permeability in Bani Al-Harith During a heavy flood, it has been
observed that flood water directed in an open dug well has quickly
disappeared from the well The same water (as judged from its quality) was
later found in a borehole 500 m away that the locals were pumping from
*  Horizontal Expansion of the City into Agricultural Land Farmers from this
district complain that their agricultural land is shrinking due to the expansion
of urban area, as well as asphalt roads (highways) connecting the city to
secondary towns in the Arhab and Nihm regions
Interesting ideas that were brought up during the meetings and are related to future
expansion in pump-irrigated areas mclude
*  Responslbility for regulating and monitormg any future expansion, as well as
controlling, must be vested m a specific body/institution that, preferably,
should also be m charge of the expansion of urban areas into agricultural
lands.
.  The implementation of any development works or management plans is
bound to fail without involving the immediate beneficiaries m an effective
manner, particularly with respect to operation and maintenance
22



*   Controlling the expansion means "sacrificing and compromising with the
future of our sons and grandchildren so what are we (farmers) getting from
the Government in terms of compensations"

Annex 7. Pesticides Use and Pest Management Plan
Situation in Yemen - Use of Pesticides
Agriculture plays an important role in the Sana'a Basin Its total areas are estimated to be
3200 km2, of which 110,000 ha arable with 24,000 ha are irrigated Unfortunately in recent
years, farmers have began to shift from traditional substance crops such as whcat, barley,
corn and sorghum to qat, which occupies about 45% of the irrigated area, followed by grapes
of 30%, and the rest of land is balanced among vegetables, cereals and tree crops
Agricultural crops are the targets of several pests including insects and diseases whose active
presence can cause a reduction in crop quality and quantity Farmers m the Sana'a Basin
increasingly rely on pesticides to control crop pests and also on non-organic fertilizers to
increase the crop yielded Even though use of these chemicals may give farmers good profits
in the short term, it can create serious problems for human health and the cnviromnent
Unfortunately, little information is available concermng the type of pesticides and fertilizers
bemg used and their application.
The use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides has grown enormously in the past decade
particularly to maximize cash crops such as qat and grape Moreover, traditional practices,
such as dustmg of grape to reduce fungal mfections, hand weeding, and crop rotation, are
declmmg in use Although control regulations do exist they are not enforccd which leads to a
serious public health hazards and damage to crops The Yemen Observer (July 28, 2001)
reported a number of cases m which farmers became seriously ill through chewing qat that
had been treated with "unidentificd killer pesticides" Recent scientific studies have indicated
insecticide residue in vegetables and fruits In another study, organochlorine insecticide
traces was detected in human milk
The scarcity of water may force farmers to use less water for irrigation, but availability of
water may encourage farmers to excessively use water to irrigate their crops Thls cxcessive
use of water, together with misuse of pesticides and fertilizers and other chemicals, may
increase irrigation runoff which will have an impact on the water quality of the aquifer in the
basm Therefore, to avoid and mitigate such runoff the design options for irrigation channels
should be as such to reduce such runoff.
Practice and Extent of Pesticide and Fertilizer Use in Yemen
A field survey was camed out in July 2001 Eight locations were selected for sampling
representing the four pilot sub-basins of the Sana'a Basm Barn Husias, Hamdan, Arhab, and
Nahem The survey indicated that the main pests in the Sana'a Basin attackmg qat and grape,
the main crops in the area, are, powder mildew, downy mildew, mealybug, scale insects,
jassid green worm and spiders Farmers claim that, in the past, pest problems did not exist
and only in recent years, after the introduction of synthetic pesticides, had the pest problems
appeared and that it was gettmg worse year after year. The study results also indicated that
lack of knowledge and carelessness are common among farmers who deal directly or
indirectly with toxic chemicals whlch cause health and environmental hazards The interview
revealed that farmers in the Sana'a Basin utilize several pesticides, however, dimethoate and
penconazole were found to be widely used and highly preferred by farmers in all the sub-
basms Most farmers had little idea of recommended dosages to protect their crops, farmers
used their ownjudgment based on experience The qat growers, for example, stated that they
can manage to increase qat production and harvest three to four times a year through the
application of more pesticides, fertilizers and irrigation All of farmers interviewed stated that
they do not wear any protective clothing whilst applying pesticides, nor take showers on
26



completion Most farmers stated that pesticides containers are stored in their houses or farm
building and not kept secure from children Empty pesticide containers are dumped
indiscriminately and, in a couple of instances, half-liter pesticide bottles were used as
drinking water containers A study by the Yemeni/German Plant Protection Project
(Salman, 1993) undertook blood tests for Cholinesterase (an enzyme) Inhibition which is an
indicator of organophosphorus pesticides poisoning A sample of some 288 farmers and
sprayers, pesticides shopkeepers, habitual qat chewers and a control group were tested The
study found that there was a high level of exposure to poisoning particularly within the
farmers' sprayers and qat chewing group, shop keepers were at less risk More than 60% of
habitual qat chewers displayed enzyme inhibition but were not interested in trying to find
untreated qat, or qat that had not been sprayed for more than two weeks and washed Similar
levels of enzyme inhlbition were seen in the spraying group The major symptoms being
suffered were headaches and tiredness
General Principles of Integrated Pest Management
In order to control or minimize pests which damage crops whilst protecting the environment,
a holistic approach or strategy has developed over recent years known as Integrated Pest
Management (IPM) IPM strives to bc ecologically sound yet pragmatic such that
communities can be mvolved in its implementation. IPM brmgs together the best strategies of
all control measures that can be applied to a given problem created by pests There are four
basic clements of IPM natural control, insect biology, ecology and adoption of sound
Economic Threshold Levels (ETL) as a basis for applying control measures such as
pesticides Natural Control relates to the fullest utilization of naturally occurrung suppressive
factors, including any practices by man that make the ecosystem less favorable for the growth
of a pest population A sound knowledge of insect biology and ecology is essential to both
natural control measures and the use of ETL and CAT, particularly an understanding of the
dynamuc relationship between the pest and the crop durmg the growth cycle Adequate pest
sampling data is essential in determimng the timing, frequency and dosage of interventions
IPM is not unknown in Yemen and research and pilot activities on citrus crops, potatoes, etc
have taken place but have not been widely adopted Present govcrnment pest control practice
in Yemen take three forms The most common are one-off campaigns that are aimed at
specific problems such as the eradication of locust or army worms durmg infestations The
second is limited biological control through the introduction natural predators on crop pests,
such as the ladybird beetle, whlch is presently bemg cultured in mass m Sana'a for release
agamst the mealybug which is a serious grape pest Third, farmers can approach GDPP to
request spraymg or allocation of chemicals However, the funds and resources are limited, as
are the research and information and databases.
Pesticides Management Planning
In order to mitigate the negative impact of the use of pesticides and fertilizers, the following
approach must be implemented.
*  Encourage and promote farmers to retain their traditional practices in plant protection
*  Educate and tram farmers and pesticide and fertilizer dealers on safe way of handling and
applying the toxic chemicals and the necessary precautions that must be taken
*  Use more appropriate tools like TV, radio and personal communications to raise public
awareness
  Tram medical personnel in the Sana'a Basin on handling pesticide poisoning and provide
them with necessary materials
*  Utilize more efficient and appropriate measures to enforce the pesticide laws, rules and
regulations
27



*  Introduce any additional legislation to better regulate the pesticide and fertilizer use and
handlmg including prohibiting the importation and sale of any chemical products without
an official permission from the governmental authority
*  Ensure that the protective clothing is available at local market and at a reasonable price
*  Design and implement IPM programs as described below
These activities will not be effective and successful without participation and sharmg
responsibility with all parties m the basin, including local authorities, NGO, farmers,
chemical dealers and governmental institutions
1PM Action Plan for Grape Cultivation4
The startmg pouit in launching an IPM program is to gather information on indigenous
farmer traditional practices as well as on the agro-ecological system in each sub-basin
However, it must be noted that the agro-ecological system of each basin and each crop has its
own pest problem, therefore, an IPM plan must be designed specifically for a particular crop
Despite its benefits, farmers may not readily accept integrated pest management techniques
because of the complexity of the IPM techniques Lack of incentive to change their
traditional pest management practices, inadequate information of economic threshold levels
for various pests, inadequate supply of suitable tramed to help farmers understand and apply
IPM techniques
Main Objective:
To design a demonstration or pilot Integrated Pest Management (IPM) plan for grapcvine
cultivation in the Sana'a Basin Project pilot areas and communicate the recommendations to
the farmers by way of consultations, farmer field schools and "field days" Grapevine
cultivation uses much less water than qat However, for grapevme farmers, qat is an attractive
alternative crop because of its higher profitability. By helping the grapevme farmers to
achieve a better level of production from their crop, the shift from growmg grapes to growing
qat can be slowed down to some extent
The MAI Department for Plant Protection has identified a second important issue which is
that the majority of the pesticides dealers are concentrated in the Sha'ub area m the center of
Sana'a City. These consist of rows of open fronted shops in which the pesticides are stored
mdiscriminately on the floors or m cellars, which is felt to constitute a public health risk
Expected outputs
(i) Grape farmer would use environment-friendly methods to control pests and diseases
(n) Grape farmers become more aware of natural methods of control of pests and plant
diseases and of the negative effects of pesticide use on the natural environment and
health.
(iii) Rccommendations for dealers to improve control and storage of pesticides
Field Operational Plan:
The following operational plan is envisaged
(a) Initially, a Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) would be undertaken among grapevine
farmers in the Bani Husheish area to gather information about the crop pests, plant
diseases and present knowledge and practices regarding their control. Other social,
physical, ecological, economic and environments data would also be gathered The
results will be discussed with the farmers and a joint action plan formulated
A similar program will shortly be developed for qat - see Main Text, para 1 14
28



(b) The second step would be the development of an IPM plan, through consultation between
the farmers and outside facilitators The plan would consist of a package of
recommendations for the farmers, including plant protection measures, better agronomic
practices mcluding pesticides use and management as one component of a series of
measures, plus improved marketing strategies
(c) Training and communicating the IPM plan and its recommendations to the grapevine
farmers, through field days and farmers' field schools would follow this
(d) A post-campaign evaluation would be undertaken after one year
Supporting activities:
A number of supporting activities would be undertaken including
(a) Production of mformation brochures and posters outlimng the IPM plan Plus simplified
versions of the pesticide and plant quarantme laws and their regulations that could be
easily understandable by the general public These would be dissemmated through
various media mcluding radco and TV
Expected outputs.
(i) All dealers of pesticides and agricultural products are familiar with the rcgulations
concerning pesticides
(ni) Farmers and "importers" are familiar with the dangers of importing plants and plant
products and with the quarantme regulations
(b) Trammg of targeted groups (extension agents, farmers, farmers' wives, cooperatives,
pesticide importers and dealers) about the dangers of pesticides and the safe use of
pesticides, including the training of farmers in adequate application techniques and safety
precautions
Expected outputs:
(i) The targeted groups would be aware of the dangers of pesticides and know how to
handle them safely
(ni) The hazards of the release of excessive amounts of pesticides into the environment
will have been reduced
c) Establishing a mobile information unit, managed by the MAI General Department of
Plant Protection
Expected outputs.
(i) Farmers and extension agents would have better and easier access to information
about pest control and plant disease identification and control
(ni) Computerized information and data on plant protection is readily available
(iii) Documentaries about plant protection to be used for further traming would be
available in the field on videotape
(d) To undertake a study about the feasibility and costs of relocating the pesticide stores and
shops concentrated in the Sha'ub area to a safer location outside of the center of Sana'a
Expected output
(i) A report on the feasibility of moving the pesticide stores and shops from Sha'ub to a
safer location outside of the center of Sana'a would be made available
Implementation Arrangements and Costs
The activities will be executed by the staff of the General Dcpartment of Plant Protection, in
collaboration with extension staff of other institutions, such as the Agricultural Research and
Extension Authority, and the Northern Regional Development Authority, plus the Sana'a
Basin project management staff
Total estimated cost (2 years) US$ 95,000

Support to the New Pesticide Residue Laboratory
A new pesticides residue laboratory has been constructed in the General Department of Plant
Protection headquarters m Sana'a City, with support from German bilateral aid However, the
laboratory lacks staff and equipment and additional support is requested for the purchase of
some equipment and training of some members This would enable the laboratory to be
operational at an earlier date and thus to be able to monitor agricultural crops produced in the
area for pesticide residues, thus protecting consumers and improving pest management
practices A list of requirements has been prepared by the Department Total estimated cost
$20,000

Annex 8. Dam Safety Expert's Report No. 1 (February 2002)
Executive Summary
1    The Project includes feasibility studies for three new dams and rehabilitation of ten existing
dams and will be carried out by Hydrosult Consulting The studies for one new dam and two
existing dams rehabilitation is carried out by TAGDI. The dam safety expert (DSE) will review the
studies carried out by the consulting firm and TAGDI and to provide comments and
recommendations
2    The Dam Safety Expert for the Sana'a Basin Water Management Project (SBWMP) was
convened to perform his services startmg Nov 2002 to review the TAGDI reports about one new
dam and other two existing dam's rehabilitation within the above mentioned project (Shaiban Dam
and Thoma and Tozan Dams)
3    The technical issues, which the PPT requested the DSE to consider, include the following
major aspects of planning, investigation, designing, construction supervision, and procurement/bid
tendering, O&M, and safety inspection
4    Review of the TAGDI Preliminary Reports, concerming Thoma, Tozan Dams and Shaiban
site, was carried out in Jordan in Dec 2001, discussed with their expert Mr Hubbosh while he was
in Jordan for about four days The comments were sent directly on Dec, 7th and 27'h to TAGDI,
WB and PPT (see Attachments 1 and 2)
5    The visit to Yemen was made on Jan 30 /3 I't and ended on Feb 1 I h, 2002 Two site visits
were made to the existing dams, on Feb. 5th to Tozan dam and on Feb 9th to Thoma Dam and U S
Shaiban proposed dam site with TAGDI technical staff and their Yemen counterparts Several
meetings were held with TAGDI team to discuss the findmgs of the sites' conditions Two meetings
were held with Hydrosult Consulting Firm on Feb 1't and 8'h m their office, attended by TAGDI,
PPT and W B consultants, to discuss several subjects on Criteria for Ranking rehabilitation of
existing dams and evaluation matrix of potential dam sites. No rcports have becn handlcd from
Hydrosult during my first mission to Yemen.
6    The Thoma Dam is m a serious condition and is badly needed for rehabilitation, especially
the spillway, left and right abutment and D S area Although I haven't received, during my
mission, the mvestigation reports done by the MOMR
7    Tozan Dam needs some investigation works, but from the reconnaissance investigation the
right abutment should be grouted to cut off the water privilege pass, between the reservoir and D S
area, which interconnect the dyke and the joints within the sandstone formation. Thc Concrete face
would be easier to be rehabilitated If it was not damaged by man-made, as existed now
8    Thc U S Shaiban site should be investigated by about three borcholes (B Hs ) to chcck the
foundation, right and left condition Also, the Borrow area at the left bank should be mvestigated,
quality and quantity-wise From the information provided by the TAGDI Team and the site visit on
Feb, 9th, it appears that the U S site is more favorable than the D S site but needs to be confirmed
by further mvestigation
9    Thoma Dam was taken over recently in March 2000 and maintenance certificate has not been
issued yet while Tozan Dam was constructed before about 15 years Both present conditions are not
satisfactory, the first because it was not constructed and supervised properly while the second it was
not treated properly during the post construction period, i e no remedial work such as cracks and
open joints in the U S concrete face should be filled with asphalt or epoxy resin instead of
removing wide area from the concrete Also, no grouting works in the abutments were carried out
31



during the construction stage That is why items 2 &3 from the W B operational policies in relation
to Safety of Dams should be strictly applied concerning the design, construction, supervision and
O&M
1-Introduction
The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the Dam Safety Expert (DSE) established by the PPT under the
Mimstry of Panning and Development for the SBWMP is as follows
To undertake a comprehensive review and evaluation of the feasiblity studies of the four new
dams, including planning, investigation design, construction supervision/quality control and O&M
to ensure their safety aspects Also to review the assessment of the ten existing dams in the
mception report and finalize the dams to be rehabilitated in the project to ensure their safety and
proper function, in consultation with PPT, FAO/IC, GDI and W B
The report No. 1 presents the review made by the DSE between Dec 2001 and Feb 1 I 2002 on the
studies made for the two existing dams and one new dam carried out by TAGDI Also, the review
depends on the site visits made to the three sites with TAGDI team and subsequent discussions
The DSE wish to acknowledge the helpful assistance provided during this assignment by the
TAGDI team who provided useful dialogue and wide ranging discussions on the two existing dams
(Thoma and Tozan) and the new Shaiban proposed dam. I would like to thank Mr Harmal who
made my tasks much easier by providing the site entry security permission and the transportation
means I would like to acknowledge the helpful correspondences with Mr Satoru, which was
directed by email
2-Tcchnical Issues and Evaluation
2/1-Thoma Dam
The principal issues considered by the DSE are as follows
*  The present condition of the dam body and foundation
*  Spillway condition
*  Right and left abutments
*  Seepage traces esp., sand boil
*  Construction problem
*  Quality control
*  New investigation works
*  Proposed rehabilitation works
The TAGDI Report was sent by email on Nov 27 and 29, reviewed, discussed and responded by
email to TAGDI on Dec 200 1(see Attachments 1 and 2)
My comments are
The dam was designed by GDI local engineer and no previous mvestigation was carried out to
investigate either the foundation or the Borrow areas. The construction supervision was inefficient
due to the limited capacity and funds of GDI, beside mcomplete conditions of contract and
instructions
2/1/1 The upstream and downstream slopes were carried out without any berms as m the submitted
drawings No traces for any slopes failure appear on the D S or U S.
The GDI supervision staff for the construction informed me that the dam work was suspended by
about one year at about mid-height of the dam, and then continued later on to the crest level This
might be resulted in developing a tension cracks in the clay core at that level due to dryness and
32



hasn't been treated properly before filling the next layers This might resulted in seepage potential
zones within the dam
Much sediment (resulted from the ponds created by the backwater from the spillway discharge) and
waste material is available at the vicinity of the downstream toe of the dam Therefore, piping of
concentrated leaks may progress unobserved and lead to failure The D S leaks should be located
and the area should be cleaned from all deposit
No treatment was carried out to the foundation except the excavation of cut off trench under the
dam, which was filled by cohesive clayey material, but it seems that the contact between the dam
and abutments is weak and inefficient
2/1/2 The spillway condition is very serious The chute foundation, beyond the concrete lining, has
been washed out as well as the foundation under the left guide wall which resulted in a long water
openig which direct the flood towards downstream toe
The spillway capacity has been checked by TAGDI and found that 100-year frequency flood is
used as mflow design which is sufficient for this structure The outlet facilities could bc used to
enhance the spillway capacity by passmg part of the mflow design flood
2/1/3 I was informed by the TAGDI team that big cavity is available at the contact between the
dam and the left abutment and the driller noticed this during the investigation work
2/1/4. Traces of leaks at D S area could be noticed, sand boihng might happen there
2/1/5 The quality of the construction work seems to be unsatisfactory Only four density tests were
carried out for the core, two for trial tests and the other two for the embankment (degree of
compaction rangcs between 84% to 98%). The results do not represent the situation and
undependable.
2/1/6 Recent investigation works were carried out by the MOMR (some B Hs, permeability tests,
ctc ) but no documents have been submitted to cvaluate the condition The taking over certificate
was issued in March 2000 but the maintenance certificate has not been issued due to the present
condition of the dam and spillway
2/1/7 Although the result of the investigation works has not been submitted but the rehabilitation
work might be consisted from the following.
Grouting the left and right abutments to minimize the water seepage there If the carried out
investigation shows high permeable zone under the dam some grouting work will be done
accordingly
Concreting the chute foundation in addition to constructing the reinforced concrete foundation
under the left guide wall of the spillway connected to chute slab Thls will direct the floods water
far away from the D S slope of the dam. The stilling basm area should be filled with big boulders
Cleaning of all the sediment and waste excavated material located at the D S area adjacent to the
toe of the dam
Construct relief wells and drain ditch at the D S area to control the pressure of seeping water under
the foundation (Design criteria were handled to TAGDI) Any uncontrollcd seepage appears m the
form of springs in the ground D S from the dam is potentially dangerous Until the construction of
relief wells, the area D S must be observed and controlled with filter, especially if sand boll
cxisted, a sandbag protection around the boil should be placed
33



Treatment of the upstream face depends on the result of the groutmg works in the left right
abutment If the seepage through the dam body will continue, the asphaltic concrete could be used
to treat the U S face
The contractor for the rehabilitation works should be professional in this field and carefully chosen
and supervised properly
2/2 Tozan Dam
The principal issues considered by the DSE are as follows
*  The present condition of the dam body, concrete facc and foundation
  Right and left abutments
*  Scdiment and topography of the present reservoir
*  Bottom outlet
*  Spillway condition
*  Seepage traces
*  New investigation works
*  Proposed rehabilitation works
The TAGDI Report was sent by email on Nov 27 and 29, reviewed, discussed and responded by
email to TAGDI on Dec 2001(see Attachments 1 and 2).
My comments are
2/2/1 The last part (about 1 km) of the access road to the dam site should be rehabilitated, as it can't
be used at present by any vehicle
2/2/2 No serious traces for any settlement or slope failure at the dam crest, downstream slope and
upstream slope have been observed Only some cracks and narrow joints opemng m the concrete
slab were noticed, besides a man-made breakmg in the concrete face at left hand side, where a
previous trial was made to remedy the concrete Unfortunately, this made the problem worse. The
main reason for this main crack is the differential settlement between the foundations under the
right portion of the dam, which is compressible while the steep rock abutment is incompressible
The problem could be easier solved if the Concrete Face (C.F ) was not broken and removed by
jackhammer Foundation has not been investigated yet for better evaluation
2/2/3 The right abutment consisted from sandstone formation It is observed that this formation is
intersected by mineral dike and interconnected to the rock joints, therefore, a potential privilege
pass to water is available between the reservoir and the D, S right area.
The GDI surveyor carried out the topographic surveying for the reservoir and the free board, and he
will prepare the ratmg curves for the reservoir accordingly
2/2/4 The bottom outlet (B 0 ) is used by the farmers there to evacuate the reservoir upon arrival
of big flood exceeding the opening elevation in the (C F ). Some small smk holes are available near
the entrance of the (B 0 )
2/2/5 The spillway condition is 0 K but it needs some protection work (about 500 m3 of big
boulders to prevent the stilling basm area from being scoured The spillway capacity was checked
by TAGDI and found that the 100-year frequency flood is used as inflow design, which is suitable
for this structure
34



2/2/6 Seepage traces are seen in the reservoir near the (B 0 ) and near the right D S area around
outlet of the (B.O )
2/2/7 TAGDI has prepared the TOR for the required investigation works (2 B.Hs) at the right
abutmcnt and D S right area to investigate the permeability of the two locations and the foundation
shearing strength MOMR will carry out the work, which depend on the condition of the access
road
2/2/8. During the last visit to the site on Feb 5th, the rehabllitation work, which include grouting,
C F rcmedial works and placement of well graded gravel beneath the damaged slab, applying
cracks filling with asphalt and providing boulders to protect the far end of the spillway, have been
estimated and TAGDI has prepared the draft B/Q schedule It will be checked and the cost will be
roughly estimated, and will be confirmed later depending on the mvestigation results
As the dam has not been filled with its full reservoir capacity, it was controlled only up to the level
where the concrete face was damaged, therefore, the dam stability should be checked dependmg on
the investigation results.
3-Bayt Shaiban- (New Dam)
The evaluation matrix of the potential dam sites within Sana'a Basm, which was agreed upon with
Hydrosult, shows that Shalban site comes in the second ranking priority within the nine potential
dam sites (See Annex 3 for comparison between the U S and D S sites which shows the
preferability of the U S Site )
TAGDI has completed the field topographic survey and the hydrology studies, and the related
information is under preparation by TAGDI
The TOR for the investigation work has been prepared by TAGDI and will be corrected because of
the visit on Feb 9th, 2002, where Borrow areas at the left abutment shall be investigated to confirm
the quality and quantity of the existing material, X e clay, filter and rock The dam type might be
Concrete face rock fill dam if the impervious and pervious soil are not available in enough quantity
or the dam will be a zoned type dam depending on the result of the geological and geotechnical
investigation Therefore, it is badly needed to construct the access road on the left abutment of the
site to have the MOMR equipment to carry out the investigation I recommend that the study for
this site should be carried out m details.
4-Conclusions and Recommendations
4/1 Thoma Dam is badly needed for rehabilitation MOMR investigation report should be issued to
have the appropriate comments for the rehabilitated works.
The dam should be monitored properly, preferable as per text issued by the Bureau of Reclamation
for the Safety Evaluation for Existmg Dams previously sent to TAGDI by email
4/2 Tozan Dam, the investigation works is preferable to be carried out to confirm and evaluate the
required grouting works The C F should be rehabilitated to increase the efficiency of this dam and
to make it safer
4/3 Shiban Dam Project, the study should be confirmed by the investigation works so as to choose
the best dam type suitable for this site.
4/4 Usually, most of the small dams' foundation, where required, is treated by consolidation
grouting to strengthen the foundation and minimize the water seepage, but it has been noticed that
this instruction has not been followed for the existing dams
35



4/5 The construction supervision plays a major role for controlling the required rehabilitation
works for the dams In future, efficient and complete contract conditions and specifications are
required
Attachment 1 (December 07 2001)
Dear Wajih (TAGDI),
Greetings from Jordan, attached herewith please find my comments which are related to the
summary report and to the five drawings of the two existmg dams Upon your arrival mn Jordan, we
will carry out further discussion related to these dams
Furthermore, it is preferable, where applicable, to use the SEED Manual attached as a guidelme for
checklist examination of dams The attached checklist is taken from the SEED manual prepared by
the U S Department of the Interior Water and Power Resources Services
Tozan Dam
1) It is not clear what exactly the upstrcam facc is made of Is it an asphalt concrete as in the
drawing or remforced concrete as was mentioned m the summary report?
2) There is a difference in the slope mentioned m the drawing and in the summary report as the U/S
slope in the report is 2H IV while in the drawing it is I 8H IV Which is correct9
3) Give sketch to the U/S face and cracks location
4) Show the volumes, areas, elevation curves and the elevation of the water m the reservoir, also
show where the farmers control the water level, which is not to be higher than the crack location in
the upstream face and indicate the reservoir water volume at that level
5) Give a sketch where the water leaks in the D/S slope of the dam or foundation and show clearly
the area and elevation of the water leak in the sketches It is not confirmed yet whether the seepage
is coming through the foundation or from the dam body
6) Nothing has been mentioned about the crest, upstream face and downstream face settlement
Give comparison between the elevation as built and the present situation
7) The underneath transition zone (1) between the face and zone (2) should be checked and proved
to be well graded and well densified Accordingly, the face will be rehabilitated or upstream
geotextile membrane should be considered and installed
8) Nothing has been said about sediment in the reservoir and how much the rcservoir volume being
affected in the last 14 years (from 1987 till 2001) and does the area around the draw off works
needs to be cleaned or not
9) Stability of the dam should be checked Similarly, check if crackmg of the U/S face was due to
settlement or slope failure Additionally, the dam stability should be checked under earthquake
loading
10) Nothing has been said about Spillway. Is it designed properly to discharge the anticipated flood
in the area?
I1) Water measurement scales are required to be installed at the upstream face Bench mark should
be fixed at right or left abutment to monitor dam body movement
36



12) Condition of the bottom outlet should be described if it needs rehabilitations
13) One or two boreholes with approximate depth of about 25 m at the right abutment could be
investigated and water permeability test shall be carried out. If permeability is excessive more than
3 to 5 Leagons grouting might be needed
Thoma Dam
1) Extreme seepage was observed from abutment, foundation and through the embankments
etc Also as it was mentioned that some sand particles were seen m the seeping water. Thls
is called piping phenomenon, this should be checked and treated accordingly
2) Two-dimensional seepage study should be carried to quantify the allowable seepage
through the dam and foundation and compare it to the actual condition and evaluatc the risk
associated with that
3) Check the stability of the dam considering the actual condition Besides, the dam should be
checked considering all possible loading conditions such as rapid draw down, normal
condition, steady flow, earthquake loading, i e OBE and MCE condition
4) All components of the Spillway design should be checked and modified if they were not
adequate and rchabilitation should be carried out accordingly.
5) Referring to item 8 from page 6 It has been noticed that thick sediment is being deposited
at the downstream toe of the dam This is resulted from the backwater curve at the far end
of the spillway (stilling basin) where this water is m touch with the toe of downstream
slope This should be prevented and sediment must be cleaned for future visual inspcction
6) Nothing is being mentioned about the treatment of the foundation by grouting during the
construction phase except a cutoff trench filled by impervious zone
7) I am in agreement with the investigation program proposed by the TAGDI team, however,
soil samples or m-situ tests should be carried out to determine the shear strength of the soil
to be able to carry out stability analysis for all the components of the dam
8) Ratmg curve for the reservoir volume, area, elevation should be added to the report and
water level scale should be installed
9) Refer to the proposed treatment for the upstream riprap by mortar grouting Thls is not
practical solution since it hughly possible to crack agam Also, I agree with the proposed
installation of the relief wells
10) Water publmng phenomenon in the reservoir should be investigated Is it due to existing
occluded cavities or holes by burrowing ammals? A treatment should be carried out, i e by
impervious blanket.
11) Nothing has been said about the draw off works.
New Dam on Wadi Bayt Shayban
1) I have not got the topographic map for the area, so I can't locate any other potcntial dam
site
2) Check the annual water yield for both sites, i e at the lower and upper dam site
3) Make sure that full geotechnical and geological investigation should be carried out to make
sure that foundation is adequate, stability is performed using the correct shear strength
parameters, seepage calculation is carried out correctly, etc
37



Attachment 2 (December 27 2001)- additional comments in relation to Thoma, Tozan and Shayban
dams
Tozan Dam
One borehole should be carried out in the dam body, the borehole should extend up to 3/4 of the
dam height in the foundation Samples should be collected otherwise SPT should be conducted m
the dam body and foundation Also, water permeability tests in the foundation should be carried
out As a village is located I km downstream of the dam with about 4000 population, the stability
of the dam should be checked
Steel net is recommended to be installed at the banks of the dam to prevent rock falling oni the
upstream face of the dam
Thoma Dam
Two boreholes should be carried out through the dam body, one at the crest and extends to about
3/4 of the height of the dam m the foundation, and the other at upstream berm and extends only to
the foundation level From these two boreholes, disturbed and undisturbed samples should be
collcctcd These samples should be tested to determine the dramed and undrained direct shear tests,
Atterberg limits, Density, Gradation, etc Core samplcs should be collccted where is possible,
otherwise SPT should be conducted Water permeability tests should be used to estrniate
permeability in the dam body and foundation Full stablity analysis should be carried out to insure
the dam is stable under static and dynamic loading(earthquake) In checking the stability of the dam
under earthquake loading, the existing village downstream should be considered Upstream
Geomembrane (impervious Membrane) could be recommended to prevent seepage CD-R showing
the installation of this membrane on some other dams will be provided to you, upon getting it from
the source
Shayban Dam
A decision, preliminary sensitivity, analysis has to be carried out for the two sites location, showing
the reservoirs volume, Reservoir filling potentiality, suitability of dam's foundation, Banks
condition, availability of construction material, spillway excavation ,dam type and prcliminary cost
The higher site weighted ratmg, from the sensitivity analysis, will be considered
However from TAGDI prelimmary report, it seems that the Upstream site is more preferable
The followmg should be checked
Check suitability of the dam foundation, permeability, quality of rock, modulous of elasticity and
strength, etc.
Evaluation of local materials, haulage distance and it availability with reference to the dam type
Stability analysis, static and dynamic, should be carried out for the dam Accordingly, samples
should be collected to determine strength  Drained and undramned direct shear tests is
rccommended Soil mdexes should be determmed like Atterberge limits, gradation, density, etc
If the upstream site is chosen the inter-catchment flow between the upstream and downstream sites
could be collected by other water harvesting method depending on the topography of the area

Annex 9. Sana'a Waste Water Treatment Plant- Rapid Assessment
Background
1   The waste water treatment plant (WWTP) was originally designed by Howard
Humphreys consulting engineers in 1995 Later in 1997, NWSA awarded a tender for
construction to a partnership of Dumez-Degremont based on the original design MISR
consulting engineers were awarded a supervision contract, which also required that the
original design be reviewed. It seems that the original design was not reviewed in depth
and construction took place on the basis of the 1995 design The WWTP was completed in
mid-2000 and was operated by Dumez-Degremont under a one-year commissiomung phase,
which ended in May 2001
WWTP Equipment and Processes
2.  The inlet works consists of 2 no (number) mechanically racked screens for normal
use and 1 no manually racked screen in the bypass channel Penstocks to divert incoming
flows to a 1 5 m dia bypass pipeline discharging into the adjacent wadi 4 no screw pumps
(3 duty, 1 standby) rated at 800 I/s lift the influent to allow gravity flow through the
works 2 no 8 0 m dia mechanical detritors are provided for grit removal, each with a grit
washing machine
Biological treatment consists of Activated sludge treatment in 8 no aeration lanes, 105 m
x 21 m x 5 5 m deep, each with an inlet mixer and 4 no aerators Settled "activated'
sludge is taken from the sludge settling tanks and returned to the inlet works
Sedimentation consists of 8 no 30 m dia mechanically scraped "secondary" settling
tanks
A Form of Tertiary treatment consists of Chlorination in a contact tank with 20 minutes
retention (a separate chlorine store is provided on site). Plus an effluent polishmg lagoon
with a volume of 4 45 days flow at average design flow
Sludge lreatment consists of. 4 no 8 0 m dia sludge thickening tanks each with mechamcal
stirrers, floor scrapers and a pump dischargmg to the sludge drying beds. Polymers are
added to accelerate dewatering 20 no sludge drying beds are provided each 55m x 27 5m
with sand and gravel under drainage and designed for manual desludging These are being
upgraded
Flow Measurement consists of A weir at the outlet of the chlorination tank measuring
flow through the plant A weir at the outlet of the aeration channels measurng flow to the
sludge thickening tanks A flume in the pipelne measurimfg returned activated sludge
Electrical energy. is drawn from the mains but is backed up by 2 no 2000 kVA diesel
generators The plant manager reports an operating cost for electricity of
$ 130,000/month The plant is also equipped with, an office, laboratory, workshop and
store, canteen and kitchen, and showering facilities
Effluent Disposal effluent is discharged into an adjacent wadi from which some 600
farmers pump the effluent to irrigate approximately 280 ha of land
40



Design Criteria and the Actual Situation
3   The original design assumed that the incoming sewage would have a biochemical
oxygen demand (BOD) loading of 500 mg/l and suspended solids (SS) loading of 750 mg/l
and that the ultimate average design flow (ADF) would be 50,000 m3/day and a peak flow
of 3x ADF The proposed quality standard for the treated effluent was set at a BOD of 30
mg/l and SS of 30 mg/l. Sludge production was estimated to be some 570 m3/day
4   In reality, the mcoming sewage was found to be much stronger In February 2001, the
mcoming BOD ranges from 520 to 1,360 with an average of 940 mg/I, almost 100% higher
than anticipated Similarly, the SS range from 554 to 1352, with an average of 1004 mg/I,
some 140% higher than anticipated The incoming flow rate ranges from 10,650 to 52,000,
with an average of 26,900 m3/day, some 53% of the anticipated ultimate design capacity
The actual quality of the treated effluent is withm BOD ranges from 6 6 to 62 4, with an
average of 23 8 mg/I, and SS ranges from 3 6 to 132 with an average of 27 9 mg/l These
are acceptable standards in terms of BOD and SS, if consistency can be achieved
However, mdependent micro-biological tests have indicated that helminths and pathogenic
bacteria are still viable in the effluent as mdicated m the table below
5   However, the plant is occasionally bypassed by its operators who close thc inlet
penstocks, so that raw sewage is discharged into the adjacent wadi, under three
circumstances. First, during electricity failure or during periods of low voltage, the standby
generators have failed to "trip-in" Second, it was also assumed that the incoming trunk
main would transport sewage only, however, the city's storm water dramage is findmg its
way into the sewer system, which means that, during the ramy season, storm water flushes
out the sewerage system and these excess flows bypass the WWTP via an overflow weir at
the inlet, polluting the wadi to the rear of the plant Third, plug flows of mineral oil and
grease have been observed to be entermg the plant During these occurrences, operators
bypass the plant m order to protect its operations
6   A further problem is that the sludge production is more than twice than anticipated
The effects of this are that the sludge drying beds are overloaded and too little sludge is
bemg drawn off from the aeration channels, which inhibits the activated sludge process
and overloads the secondary settling tanks Independent micro-biological tests have
indicated that, although helminths and pathogenic bacteria are still viable in fresh sludge,
these had died off after six months

7.  A recent micro-biological analysis of the effluent from the WWTP was carried out by
WEC, University of Sana'a, a summary of which is shown in the table below As can
readily be seen, the presence of pathogens contravenes the Yemeni Standards for irrigation
water, which stipulates zero pathogens

Identified Problems
8   Consulaqua, a German Consulting Company, was commissioned m 2000 to review
the operations of the WWTP and to make recommendations for solutions to the problems
that had arisen and to review the possibilities for wastewater and sludge reuse Six
particular problems were identified
(l)    Sludge drying and disposal.
(ii)   Discharge of raw sewage mto the wadi and mconsistcnt effluent quality
(m)    Foul odors emanating from the WWTP
(iv)   Establishing optimum plant operations.
(v)    Achieving the ultimate plant design capacity
(vi)   Safe disposal of the effluent and sludge
The consultant recommended four packages of improvements Package 0 comprises a
number of measures to improve plant operations, including constructing primary
sedimentation tanks and additional sludge thickeners and improvements to thc bypass
channcl Package I includes geological exploration and effluent reuse through aquifer
recharge and improved irrigation Package 2 includes sludge treatment using mechanical
dewatering, improving the drying beds and construction of a packagmg station Package 3
includes Odor Control measures These measures are prioritized into primary and
secondary interventions each having stages or steps. Many of the recommendations have
merit but others appeared costly in terms of capital and operational costs The total cost of
all the packages was some $47 m, of which up to $21 m would be for a facility to use the
treated effluent to recharge the aquifer These modifications would add an operations and
maintenance burden of approximately $8 m per year
42



9   The purpose of this assessment is not to comment on Consultaqua's recommendation,
however, it is recommended that any further works should be the subject of a detailed
design study that should emphasize appropriate and least cost technological solutions
Possible Solutions
10 Sludge Drying and Disposal The production of sludge is more than twice that
anticipated and the sludge drying beds and sludge stock plhng area is far too small This is
exacerbated by NWSA who have not removed any sludge from the site, as they were
expected to do each six months under the terms of the contract It is claimed that some
100,000 m3 of dried sludge are presently stockpiled at the plant The immediate solution
would be to find as suitable landfill sitc nearby in which to dispose of the sludge In
parallel, the area of drying beds and stockpiling area should be mcreased by obtaming land
adjacent to the WWTP This may be linked to giving dried sludge to farmers for their own
use or resale as a soil conditioner The local farmers cooperative have expressed interest in
undertaking this enterprise. Sufficient drying time of sLx months or more should be
allowed to ensure the die-off of pathogens, helmmths and ova and regular micro-biological
and chemical testing of the sludge should be carried out to safeguard health The sludge
loading on the acration tanks could be greatly reduced by providing primary
sedimentation.
Discharge of raw sewage and inconsistent effluent quality An immediate action would bc
for NWSA to investigate where oil and storm water is entering the sewer and seek to stop
the dumping. In parallel, a holdmg tank of 24-36 hours capacity should be constructed at
the inlet to store excess storm water flows or flows polluted with oil and grease and
equipment provided to skim off the oil and pump the stored influent back into the
treatment stream when the flow has returned to normal.
Foul odors emanating from the WWTP Foul odor emanates mainly from the inlet area,
the aeration channels and the sludge drying areas of the plant which is an
embarrassment, as the plant is adjacent to the mternational airport Odors from the sludge
drying area and aeration channels can be mimmized by improving operations and,
particularly, removmg the dried sludge to land fill or other disposal Consulaqua
recommends enclosing the inlet works and providing an exhaust fan, ducting and a bubble
aerator in the aeration tanks This is a reasonable suggestion but other alternatives should
be sought for comparison
Safe disposal of the effluent The wastewater (effluent) is a valuable resource in the water
scarce Sana'a Basm It could be reused in two ways; for aquifer recharge or irrigation
Irrigation could be made more efficient by providing a balancmg lagoon after the outlet
from the WWTP and providing a piped or channel gravity distribution system The
feasibility of such a system has been investigated by the FAO Watershed Management and
Wastewater Reuse Project that was active in the area Although the effluent is chlorinated
before discharge, there is a risk m operating such a scheme - the WWTP must maintain a
consistent flow of effluent free from pathogens, as the farmers may use the effluent for
irrigatiori of tomatoes and other crops that need not be cooked before consumption This
risk to public health could be controlled by strict monitoring of the effluent, education of
the farmers and control of cropping patterns Aquifer recharge is more problematic due to
the risk of polluting the aquifer or alternatively the high costs of purification (Consulaqua
estimates $34m capital costs and $2.77m/year operational costs which seem unrealistic) A
secondary issue is that farmers have assumed the right to use the effluent for irrigation and
diverting the flow to aquifer recharge may cause social problems.
43



* Next Steps
11 The design and operational problems of the Sana'a WWTP pose clear health risks to
the population, both to farmers using the effluent for irrigation and to consumers of the
crops they produce, especially vegetables eaten raw  There are also risks to the
environment, to the ecosystems along the wadi and to groundwater quality These
problems arc most severe when raw sewage is being bypassed around the plant Howcvcr,
even when the treatment process is working correctly and the effluent standard in terms of
BOD and SS are within acceptable ranges, the reuse of the effluent calls for better
monitoring and restrictions on the crops grown because of the pathogenic content in the
effluent. The present mabihty to deal with the large volumes of sludge is also creating an
increasingly severe health and environmental threat, as the partly stabilized wet sludge also
contains high levels of pathogens until drying and degradation has taken place
12 Addressing these issues will require two types of actions First, short-term actions
that could be implemented immediately. Second, the completion of a detailcd plant audit,
and the production of final designs for minimum plant modifications, e increased area of
sludge drying beds, construction of detention tanks to avoid bypassing the plant, primary
settling tanks to reduce the sludge load and odor control. It is envisaged that the detailed
design study will be funded by the Government The detailed designs could commence in
February 2003 and be completed within four months. The civil works would be funded
from the Arab Fund. The works themselves could be completed within 12 months, if a
contractor with good resources could be hired It is estimated that the minimum
improvement costs would be approximately $12 million.
13 The WWTP management may fall under a leasc management contract being
negotiated by the Sana'a Local Corporation It is essential that WWTP performance
guarantees and penalties for non-performance be specified in the contract
14  The "short-term actions" that could be mstituted m the immediate future should
include the following actions, which are reflected in the EMP
*   Removal of the accumulated dried sludge within the WWTP to a land fill site
*   A "red flag" system to warn farmers if raw sewage is being discharged to the wadi
*   Farmer education on the hazards of treated and untreated wastewater
A ban on the use of effluent to irrigate vegetables eaten raw.
A restriction of the types of crops being grown
15 In parallel, a feasibility study funded by CIDA has been launched to review the reuse
of wastewater and sludge The recommendations of this study, which should be available
m early 2003, will provide clear guidance as to future strategy for safe and economic waste
water and sludge reuse

Part 1. Chemical and Physio-chemical Analyis for Wastewater and Sludge from
Wastewater Treatment Plant in Sana'a
Sampling and Reservation and Methods of Analysis
A.     Wastewater:
Al.     Samples collection:
Samples were collected from mfluent of the wastewater treatment system for 24 hrs and
after the retention pond Samples were collected m plastic bottles of 500 ml, with care to
leave ample air space when closmg the contamer. Two samples were of each were
collected
A2.     Samples reservation:
Samples were mixed with some drops of chloroform for preservation and kept in
refrigerator at 4°C
A3.     Methods of Water Analysis:
1   Suspended Solids (S.S). was determmed using filtration technique followed by
weighing according to the standard methods
2   pH was determined by pH meter
3   EC was determmed by electrical conductivity meter
4 Na+- was determmed by atomic absorption spectrophotometer at characteristic
wavelength Standard Solution was prepared
5   Ca7 and Mg+ were determined by titration with Fersmite
6. Residual chlorine was determined by lodometric method
7   Determination of chloride (Cl-) was determmed by titration of chloride with silver
nitrate
8   Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) was determined by Kjeldahl method
9 Heavy metals as "B, Mn, Cu, Pb, Cd, Ni, Zn, Se, Cr, Al, and Co" were determined
by atomic absorption spectrophotometer
10   Heavy metal as "Cn" was determmed by spectrophotometer

C.     Methods of Analysis:
I  Extract preparation extract was prepared proportionally (1 1) distilled water and
sludge. This quantity should be sufficient for the following analysis
1-1 pH determination using pH meter
1-2 EC using Electrical Conductivity meter
1-3 Na, Ca, Mg, Cl was determined as mentioned for the wastewater
2   Heavy metals as B, Mn, Cu, Pb, Cd, Ni, Zn, Se, Cr, Al, and Co" were determined
after digestion of samples, by atomic absorption spectrophotometer, while "Cn" was
determined by spectrophotometer
3   Organic matter (O M) was determmed by "Weakly & Blake" method This method is
based on oxidation of orgamc matter
4   Total mtrogen was determined by digestion, distillation by Kjeldahl method followed
by titration
Results and Discussions
Wastewater after retention pond:
Comparing the results of the analysis (Table 11-1) with the standard guidelines for irrigation,
the following conclusions can be drawn
Chloride is in the range of 7-8 meq/l, which is less than the maximum allowable However,
according to FAO, 4-lOmeq/l is considered as the range of negative effect Chloride at high
concentrations might cause some problems to some fruits such as grapes
EC, which reflects the saluuty of the wastewater, mdicates that EC are high This concludes
that wastewater is in the range of medium to high salnity A continuous application of this
water will render the soil as sahne SAR was calculated to be 14 7, which indicates the
possible negative effect on irrigated soil, which will then have an impact on the growth of the
plants
High pH of 8 1 indicates the wastewater has included high concentration of base as Ca C03,
which will cause a decrease in the soil fertility, which will have a bad effect on the plant
growth, especially in the Yemen soil which is generally base
Concentration of Boron was in the high limits, which might cause toxicity to some plants.
Heavy metals as Cobalt, Boron, Nickel, and Cadmium have exceeded the permissible levels
for irrigation water This would cause accumulation of heavy metals in the soil and eventually
will cause toxicity to plant
Copper and Chromium, although their concentrations are still close to the allowable levels,
the continuous use will cause accumulation with time, which will pollute the soil and affect
the plant growth
Moreover, as far as the health conditions of people and animals is concerned, some heavy
metals might not affect the plant growth but could have a toxicity effect on the people and
ammals Accumulation of heavy metals in the plant will be transferred and accumulated in the
bodies of the consumers However, thls implies contmuous measurements of the heavy metals
47



concentrations m the soil and plant irrigated by the wastewater after retention ponds, which
are ultimately consumed by the people and animals
Influent Wastewater:
From Table 11-1, it is clear that only Cobalt was detected at higher concentrations of 0 08-
0 09mg/I which is higher than the industrial wastewater guidelines, which should not be
higher than 0.05mg/l This needs more investigations to check the source of this high
concentration level
Sludge:
From Table 1 1-2, it is shown that all values are within the values expected in the international
typical sewage sludge
The sludge, as an organic matter, is generally used to improve the soil especially the base
soils This is very useful for Yemen as the Yemen soil is gencrally base However, care
should be taken when adding sludge to soil
Apart from wastewater application, sludge application to soil is more safe as it can easily be
controlled by dosing the proper weight of sludge to soil according to the chemical
concentrations needed in the final mixture
Awareness of the biological pollution should be done with the farmers in order to avoid the
transfer of diseases from the sludge due to application and direct contact with the sludge and
plants.

Part 2. Microbiological Analysis for Wastewater and Sludge from Wastewater
Treatment Plant in Sana'a
Introduction
Pathogenic orgamsms in wastewater and sludges as fungi, bacteria and pathogenic protozoa
cause many diseases for humans and animals Fungi pathogenic to humans such as Candida
albican, can be recovered in varying numbers from wastewater treatment plant effluents,
streams receivmg such effluents, and recreational waters In humans, this fungus is usually a
commensal organism, in healthy adults have detectable levels in their feces also a very large
proportion of the female population has vaginal candidcasis m varying degrees of severity
984 species of fungi listed in water and wastewater (Cooke, 1986) Trichophyton
mentagrophytes, the cause of tinea pecls or athlete's foot
Pathogenic bacteria that have been transmitted by water or wastewater are  Salmonella,
Shigella, Escherchia coli, Vibrio cholera, Mycobactertum, Leptospira and Francisella These
organisms cause many diseases for humans and animals such as fever, vomiting, diarrhea,
weakness and weight loss The distribution of E colt is worldwide in water sources
(Wachsmith, 1984)
The parasitic protozoa and helminths of primary concern in drinking water and wastewater
are Entamoeba histolytica, Giard&a lamblia, Naegler:a, Taenia worms, Ascarts worm,
Belharisia worms and others as Ancylestoma duodenale. These organisms cause diarrhea or
gastroenteritis of varying severity for humans and some animals
Between 1963 and 1984, 90 waterbome outbreaks and more than 23,000 cases of giardcasis
were reported in America (Craun and Jaku Bowski, 1987) Micro-organisms examination of
wastewater and sludge may indicate the effectiveness of wastewater treatment process
The aim of this project is to analysis the wastewater and sludge from wastewater treatment
plant in Sana'a, m order to investigate the quality of wastewater and kind, and density of
micro-orgamsms in wastewater and sludge
* Materials and methods
A.     Sampling:
AL.Wastewater:
Samples were collected from mfluent of the wastewater treatment system for 24 hours and
from retention pond Sterilized bottles 11 were used with care to leave ample air space in the
bottle (at least 2 5cm) to facilitate mixing by shaking before examination Two samples each
were taken
A2. Sludges:
Samples were collected from thickener, drying beds and from the storage at different places
(three, six and twelve months age) Sterilized containers for 1 kg sludge were used Two
samples each were taken
53



B.     Preservation and storage:
Samples were transported to laboratory within 30 minutes and started microbiological
exammation promptly to avoid unpredictable changes.
Samples were stored in refrigerator at 5°C during examination The time elapsed between
collection and examination did not exceed 24 hours.
Each plate with sample number, dilution, date, and any other necessary information beforc
examination was marked
C.     Methods of Analysis for water and sludge:
To examine fungi and bacteria, membrane filter technique was used as follows
Membrane filter technique
Procedure
Preparation and dilution:
To a sterile 250- ml erlenmeyer flask 135 ml sterile distilled water and 15 ml sample from
both influent of the wastewater treatment system and retention pond were added individually
to obtain a 1 10 sample dilution
Dilution was continued until 1 1000 sample dilution with shaking vigorously after each
transfer A stcrile measuring device was rinsed with sterile distilled water between samples
To examine sludge, 10 Og sludge from different samplmg positions were dissolved in lOOml
sterile distilled water and filtrated to remove debris Then 15 ml solution from each sample
was added to 135 sterile distilled water to obtain a 1 10 sample dilution Dilution was
continued till 1 1000 samplc dilution
Media
1 For fungi, Streptomycin Tetramycin Malt Extract Agar (STMEA) is useful in analyzing
sewage and polluted water (Quresh and Dutka, 1978) 30 Og malt extract, 5 Og pepton, and
15 Og agar were mixed m 800 ml distilled water and was sterilized 70 0 mg each of
streptomycin and tetramycin in separate 100 ml portion distilled water Then the mixturc was
sterilized by filtration and were added to the cooled (45°C) agar base The pH was 5 4
2 For bacteria, Trypton glucose yeast agar was used for bacteria, 5 Og trypton, 2 Og yeast
extract, l.Og glucose, 15.Og agar and 11 distilled water The pH was 7.0 Then 20-ml portion
fungi and bacteria media were poured into sterile petri dishes and let agar harden
* Filtration
lOOml of well-shaken sample of the dilutedl 1000 sample was filtered through membrane
filter with pore size of o.8p.nm Filters were transferred onto surface of pre-dried agar plates.
* Incubation
All petri dishes for fungi were incubated at 15°C for 7-10 days, but bacteria mcubated at 35°C
for 24-48 hours
* Counting and recording
A binocular dissectmg microscope was used at a magnification of lOx, all colonies were
counted on each selected plate. Record results were as colony forming units (CFU) /100 ml

origmal sample Sludge samples were reported as "CFU/g wet weight Average number of
colonies for four plates and for two samples were counted by the following cquation
(Total) coliform colomes or other pathogens/100 ml
coliform colonies or other counted pathogens x 100
ml sample filtered
To examine pathogenic protozoa, concentration technique was used as follows
100 ml samples from both influent to wastewater treatment plant, and retention pond were
filtered by cheesecloth also 10 Og sludges from different sampling positions were mixed in
I OOml sterile distilled water and filtrated to remove debris
50 ml from each sample was filtered through membrane filter Membrane filter was removed
by a pair of forceps and placed to side wall of a 100-ml beaker and repeatedly flushed filter
surface with several milliliters dcstilled water Scanned portions of each sample concentrate
were poured into a 10- ml conical ccntrifuge tube and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes
Without disturbmg sediment, removed supernatant with a capillary pipette then a drop of the
remainder was transferred to a microscope slide and a Sedwick-Rafter counting cell for
examination and counting

Results and Discussions
Table 11-3 shows that there were differences among density of various bacteria in
wastewater The density of bacteria in influent of the wastewater treatment system were more
than retention pond and this is due to efficiency of chlormation process (80-94%) Chlorine
dose used is about 6-lOmg/L (Hamid Alkomisy, personal communication)
In Table 11-4, numbers of bacteria m thickener were more than that in drying bed Thls is due
to the presence of organic material Bacteria decrease in the sludge from the storage of twelve
months Thls is due to the exposition of sludge to sun, which killed the bacteria
Table 11-3 shows that there were differences among density of Candida in the wastewater
The density of fungus m Retention pond was less than that in the influent of the wastewater
treatment system by 50%
This means that efficiency of chlorination process was more useful on bacteria than fungi
Fungi are more resistant to chlorination and disinfection than colhform bacteria.
Rosenengweig et al (1983) reported that fungal cells, especially Conidia, can survive at much
higher doses of chlorme than coliform bacteria, including 10 mm exposure He found that
Fungus m thickeners was more than that in drying bed this relevant into organic substances in
thickeners and exposition of drymg bed to sun
Table 11-3and 11-4 show that there were differences among density of various protozoa and
other parasites in wastewater and sludge. The density of protozoa in retention pond were less
than that m influent of wastewater treatment system by 10- 50%
This indicates that cfficiency of chlorination process in the treatment plant is 10 - 50% for
protozoa Gzardra cysts and other protozoa are more resistant to disinfection than bacteria
Sludge monitoring also may indicate treatment processes efficiency The density of protozoa
m thuckener were more than that in drying bed relevant into organic materials and the
effectiveness of sunshme and other factors

Terms of Reference
1. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND PHASE I PROJECT OBJECTIVES
The Sana'a Basm is located in central highlands of Yemen and includes the Capital City
Sana'a The basin has an area of 3,200 km2 and an average elevation of 2,200 meters
above mean sea level Current population of the basm is estimated at about 1 5 million, of
which 300,000 live in the rural areas, and the population growth rate is projected to decline
from the current 6% to about 4% by 2030 The basin includes some 110,000 hectares (ha)
of arable land, of which about 20,000 ha are irrigated Groundwater is the major source of
water m the basm  Abstractions began to exceed recharge during the mid 1980s as a
consequence of the rapid urban population growth and a sharp mcrcase m water use by
agriculture, encouraged by the introduction of tube-well technologies The basin is
experiencmg a serious depletion of groundwater resources with an associated alarming
degradation m water quality. The situation is further complicated by the absence of an
integrated water resources management plan for the basm mcluding lack of data, absence
of a regulatory framcwork to manage the groundwater extractions and inefficient irrigation
practices  Unless action is taken to improve the management of the basin's aquifers,
current levels of water resources depletion will crcate a crisis in water availability and
supply in the near future In addition a new Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) has
recently been commissioned to the north of Sana'a, its effluent could provide a valuable
resource if public health issues can be avoided The Government of Yemen is well aware
of the situation and is taking steps to address the water resources management issues in the
basm
To address some of the development issues, the Government and the World Bank have
agreed to prepare a Sana'a Basm Water Management Program The objectives of this
proposed program are a) to increase both quantity and the usable life of the groundwater
resources available for domestic and industrial use in the Basm, and so to postpone the
date at which the new supplies have to be brought m from outside the Basm, and b) to
simultaneously increasc the efficiency of agriculture water use so as to allow time for a
gradual shift to a less water-based rural economy in the Basin.
The Sana'a Basin Water Management Program will be implemented through an Adaptable
Program Credit (APC) financed by the International Development Association (IDA) a
part of the World Bank Group This would allow IDA and the Government of Yemen to
agree on a long-term (15 years) program to be implemented in three consecutive phases of
which the proposed project is the first phase Each phase would be built on the experience
and progress of the preceding one and startmg only after certam milestones have been met
In this first phase (five years), technological solutions and institutional arrangements will
be tested on a pilot basis in four representative sub-basms for later incorporation into a
full-scale basin-wide program to be implemented durmg the subsequent two phases
The objectives of Phase I of this Program are 1) to test and develop demand and supply
management methods for large-scale implementation throughout the Basin during the
subsequent phases of the program; 2) to establish the regulatory, legal and institutional
framework needed for more sustamable water resources management in the Basin, and 3)
to carry out the preparation of the Phase II project of the Program
These TORs where modified in May 2001 to reflect the findings of World Bank mission to
identify the pilot sub basins and the proceedings of an Environmental Assessment Scoping
and Public Disclosure workshop..
60



2.  ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES AND REQUIREMENTS
The Sana'a Basin Water Management Project has been designated as a Category A projcct
requiring an environment assessment, m accordance with the Bank's Operational Policy
(OP 4 01) Additional Bank environmental and social safeguard policies to be evaluated
for possible application and compliance would include Natural Habitats (OP 4 04), Pest
Management (OP 4 09), Involuntary Resettlement (which includes involuntary land
acquisition (OD 4.30), Cultural Property (OP 4 11) and Safety of Dams (OD 4 37) which
are available in Arabic and English In addition, the project should comply with the
provisions of the Water Resources Management Policy The Environmental Assessment
should also comply with Yemem Environmental Protection Law No 26 of 1995 Given the
spatial dimension and complexity of the water issues in the Sana'a Basm, a Regional
Environmental Assessment (REA) would be conducted as part of the project preparation
The objectives of this REA are to (1) examine the environment issues and impacts
associated with the water resources, irrigation and agricultural strategies, policies,
programs and projects m the basm; (2) evaluate and compare the impacts these against
those of the alternatives, (3) assess legal and institutional aspects relevant to the issues and
impacts, and (4) recommend broad measures to strengthen environmental management in
the sector Particular attention will be given to potential cumulative impacts of multiple
activities envisioned in the Project
A number of studies have been identified as necessary to the preparation of a Sana'a Basin
Water Management Program. These studies are designed to fill the gap in the information
and knowledge required to develop a project targeted at the real water issues in the basin
and to provide extensive input m the preparation of the REA Phase I of the program will
be implemented in the selected four sub-basms is expected to focus on cnhancing supply
management through groundwater recharge schemes (particularly small retention dams
and underground recharge) as well as on improving demand management through the
improvement of irrigation efficiency In parallel with dcmand and supply management, the
project will also assist in setting up water momtoring system and addressing the social and
institutional issues The project will take place within the context of the strategic water
resources management plan for the basm currently being developed by the Yemen
National Water Resources Authority (NWRA) with assistance from UNDP
2.1 Coordination with Other Project Preparation Studies
These terms of reference (TOR) are intended to integrate the environmental assessment
(EA) requirements with the Phase I project preparation components into a single process
The intcrnational and local specialists specified in this document will join the other
spccialists engaged in the project preparation to form a multidisciplinary team for the
preparation of the project, including the environmental impact The international
environmental assessment specialist will have the overall responsibility for the preparation
of the draft environmental assessment report.
The international enviromnental assessment specialist (the Consultant) and his specialist
team (biodiversity, public health and cultural heritage) will be members of the Project
Preparation Team (PPT) and will liaise directly with study teams. The studies that will
form the basis for desigmng the project components to be prepared by the PPT are listed in
the table below These studies will also provide basic data for the EA. Each of the
individual studies, other than Satellite Imagery have a specific environmental component
The Consultants will also liaise with NWRA staff working on the Sana'a Basm Master
Plan (with assistance from UNDP), to collect mformation which would be relevant to the
EA

3. POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES ARISING FROM THE PROGRAM
AND PHASE 1 PROJECT
As expected in any program or project, the program and phase 1 project have the potential
to create both negative and positive environmental impacts as a result of rehabilitation and
construction and operation of groundwater recharge enhancement schemes, mistallation of
irrigation improvement equipment, as well as institutional and social arrangements Some
of the commonly known potential environmental impacts of water resources and irrigation
improvement projects are categorized and described below.
3.1 Land and Soil Resources
.  Increased crop yields due to improved irrigation may mvolve increased use of
pesticides and fertllizers and their related impacts. Long-tcrm accumulation of
chemicals in the soil may permanently alter the types of crops that can be supported
Different water use scenarios may have effects on production of cash and subsistent
crops such as fruits, vegetables, qat5, etc.
5      Qat is a cash crop produced predommantly in the highlands of Yemen A large proportion of
the population is dependent on qat production and sale for their livelihood Furthermore, qat plays an
important role in Yemeni social life.
62



. In some locations, increased irrigation and drainage could lead to significant
accumulation of salts and its related impacts on the soil fertility, crop yields, and
natural plant communities
* Land may need to be taken for estabhshment of improved drainage on individual
farms and for dramage areas This may require involuntary acquisition of small areas
of land to construct these improvements
3.2 Water Resources/Water Quality
* Water logging and associated impacts resulting from the proposed small dams and
wastewater recharge components of the project Thius includes the impacts on the water
quality issues in recharging of the aquifer Similarly the impacts of irrigation runoff on
the water quality of the aquifers in the basm Construction of the small dams may
require involuntary land acquisition and will also require site specific archaeological
surveys to assess potential adverse impacts to cultural property
* Impacts of tube well pumping on the water resources in the basin including potential
problems of saline water intrusions into freshwater aquifers
* Increase in sedimentation and silting due to the construction of recharge basins and
small dams
* Impacts on the water quality due to point and non-point sources For example non-
point sewage pollution due to cesspits and solid wastes dumpmg
3.3 Natural Habitats and Cultural Heritage
*  While the increase in rrigation and recharge basins could alter the hydrology of the
area affecting the local natural and man-made habitats of importance to resident and
migratory species. In addition, the proposed project could also create new aquatic
habitats on a local basis These issues should be evaluated at the program and phase I
project level on the basis of a project area review of natural habitats, whlch should be
complemented by field based surveys of proposed sites for investment activities
*  The region is rich in cultural heritage and hence potential impacts of the project should
be evaluated including sites of archaeological, historical, architectural and/or sacred
significance A desk based review of cultural heritage values should be made at the
program level while site specific investigations will be carried out for all proposed site
specific investments The investigation will also evaluate potential impacts to
graveyards and/or burials Chance Find Procedures will be developed for use in the
project to address management of unknown archeological finds that may be
encountered during the course of construction activities
* Increased crop yields may require changes in field patterns and involve land leveling
Given the ancient and/or historic nature of terraces m many places in Yemen, proposed
actions should be reviewed for their potential archaeological impact In addition, land
leveling may damage or destroy archaeological sites and areas proposed for land
leveling should be subject to site specific archaeological reviews
3.4 Public Health Issues
* Impacts due to the pollution being caused by urban wastewater and the potential
impacts of the increase in habitats for pests and other disease vectors as result of the
recharge basins and small dams. This issue is particularly important with the
inadequate sewage treatment and potential for water resource contamination m the
Basm
 Reuse of treated wastewater and sludge, particularly from the Sana'a Waste Water
Treatment Plant, through direct application or recharge and pumpmig may adversely
affect health of the farmers, as well as the consumers
63



* Potential public health impacts resulting from water borne diseases due to the presence
of small dams, irrigation and dramage structures and stagnant water bodies
* Potential public health impact related to pest management activities
3.5 Pesticides and Pest Management
.  Increased crop yields due to umproved irrigation may mvolve increased use of
pesticides and fertilizers Exposure of agricultural workers to pesticides and fertilizer
* Impacts to surface and groundwater quality from the use of pesticides and fertilizers
3.6 Damns And Dam Safety
*  The Sana'a Basm contains more than 40 hydraulic structures of which 25 are dams of
more than 15 meters in height Of these dams many are in need of repair and
rehabilitaton and may be a hazard to public safety
* The project will propose construction of a number of new dams or recharge structures
that may entail the acquisition of land or possibly resettlemcnt although this is
unlikely.
*  A Dam Safety Review activity will be carried out separately to examine the quality
and safety aspects of the design of the new dams and the required rehabilitation work
.
4. CONSULTANT SCOPE OF WORK
Using the above mentioned preparation studies and other relevant assessments, the
consultant will be responsible for the following tasks
4.1 Initial Scoping, Stakeholder and Public Disclosure Consultation
Generally the Consultant will collect and review existing information on the relevant
physical, socio-cultural and biological environmental characteristics of the Sana'a Basin
This will help to provide baselme conditions from which to establish benchmarks for
project impact assessment and monitormg. However, more specific studies will be required
in the pilot sub basins where, for example, potential dam sites or sites of cultural heritage
may require mspection
* Review relevant reports, data, maps, charts, documents, study results prepared by the
national and international consultants including but not limited to those prepared by
Italconsult, Mosdgiprovodkoz, SAWAS Review the NWRA Regional Plan being
assisted by UNDP, mcluding Water Resources Management Action Plan for the Ta'iz
Region and preparation documents for a Sana'a Water Resources Management Action
Plan Review the working papers, PCN, PCD, and othcr documents prepared by the
World Bank for the Sana'a Basm Water Management Project Review the results of
the Social Assessment, the Satellite Imagery Assessment, the Isotope Application
studies, and other studies
* On the basis of this review and in cooperation with the Environmental Protection
Commission (EPC), carry out scoping and stakeholder consultations in coordination

4.2.3. The Socio-economic Environment: The social assessment for the Sana'a Basm
Water Management Project was conducted m 1999-2000 as a preparatory step for the
design of the project This assessment shows the social and economic conditions that exist
and the possible risks afforded by the project The Consultant should use the social
assessment as the point of departure to focus the investigation on the links between the
beneficiary population and the specific physical and health problems that could arise On
the basis of the combined findigs provide the socially appropriate mitigation measures
The Consultant should conduct analysis and evaluation of population figures and
distibution, land use, planned development activities, identification of affected persons,
community structure, and organization with respect to water use Furthermore, employment,

properties, tribal peoples and customs, aspirations, attitudes and restramts to changes in
water use behavior should be assessed The Consultant will also refer to planned rural
assessments which will determine the extent of agricultural areas, cropping patterns and
intensities, typical crop yields, farm incomes, irrigation water requirements and
consumption patterns. The Consultant is expected to work closely with the PPT to benefit
from the information being collected and to ensure that additional information needed to
carry out this task are indeed gathered by the PPT and the study teams Particular emphasis
should be placed on the role and impact on women
4.2.4. The Cultural Heritage Environment: The Consultant should assess, using

Sana'a Basin Water Resources Management Project
Environmental Impact Assessment
Terms of Reference - Pest & Pesticides Specialist
Background:
The GOY is preparing a Water Resources Management Project for the Sana'a Basm for
World Bank fundmg A mandatory requirement of the World Bank for the processmg of
the project is that an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) be carried out Thc EIA will
focus on a number of specific areas including, Land and Soil Resources, Water Resources
and Water Quality, Public Health, Natural Habitats and Cultural Heritage Some indicative
information for the EIA will be collected durmg a Stage 1 Basin Characterization Study
surveys which will be complete by mid April 2001 and result in the selection of three or
more pilot sub basins in which the project will concentrate. However, primary data and
information for the EIA will be gathered during three Stage 2 project preparation studies
X e Supply Management and Aquifer Recharge, Demand Management and Irrigation
Improvement, and Institutional and Social Design Which will be undertaken between
May and August 2001 In parallel an EIA tcam will be formed consisting of an
International Environmental Expert/ team leader plus four national experts on Public
Health, Biodiversity, Pest Management and Cultural Heritage who will undertake
additional studies and analysis in order to prepare an EIA Report and Mitigation Plan The
areas surrounding Sana'a are heavily cultivated and the farmers make use of fertilizers and
pesticides which may have environmental impact on ground water and surface water and
be a hazard to public health
Scope of works:
It is anticipated that the consultant will make up to one month's part time inputs durmg the
period between June and August 2001 consisting of the following tasks
Review and analyze relevant documentation and data collected in the stage 2 project
preparation studies These terms of refcrence should be rcad in conjunction with the TOR
for stage two studies in order that the consultant should be fully aware of the data that will
be provide to him/her and that which will have to be collected from the field
Based on field visits and any available data and studies estimate the types and extent of the
use of pesticides and fertilizer in the Sana'a basm.
Evaluate the exposure of agricultural workers to pesticides and fertilizer and evaluate the
risk to health and well being
Evaluate the impacts of pesticides and fertilizer on surface and groundwater quality
Propose mitigation measure to reduce any negative impacts of the use of pesticides and
fertilizer and develop a Pest Management Plan.
Participate in the EIA "reporting workshop" in which the findings of the studies and
proposed mitigation plan are presented and discussed.
