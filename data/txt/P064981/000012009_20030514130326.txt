purpose and 
program 
phasing: 
Program 
Purpose 
The 
main 
purpose 
of 
the 
15-year 
Adaptable 
Program 
Lending 
(APL) 
operation, 
of 
which 
the proposed 
project 
is 
Phase 
1, 
is 
essentially 
to 
assist 
the Government 
of 
Yemen 
(GOY) 
in 
slowing 
down 
depletion 
of 
groundwater 
in 
the 
Sana'a 
Basin aquifer 
to 
gain 
time 
for 
GOY 
to 
convert the 
Sana'a 
Basin 
economy 
to 
less 
water-intensive 
activities and 
encourage out-migration. 
Program 
Phasing 
The 
APL 
is 
designed 
in 
three 
phases, 
each 
of 
about 
five 
years. 
Phase 
I, 
described 
in 
detail 
in 
Section 
C, 
is 
designed 
to 
test 'best 
practice' 
technologies and 
approaches 
for 
demand 
and 
supply 
management, 
as 
well 
as 
institutional 
arrangements. 
Results 
would 
be 
closely monitored. Based 
on 
clearly defined 
'triggers' 
(see 
B-4 
- 
Triggers 
for 
Subsequent 
Credits), 
follow-on 
phases 
would 
expand 
experiences 
and 
lessons 
gained 
throughout the 
Sana'a 
Basin. 
Problem 
Statement 
Yemen, 
at 
the southern 
tip 
of 
the 
Arabian 
Peninsula, 
faces 
extreme 
water 
shortages. 
Water 
availability 
in 
Sana'a 
City, 
capital 
of 
Yemen, 
is 
one 
of 
the 
scarcest 
in 
the 
world. 
Bringing 
in 
water 
from 
outside the 
basin 
has 
been 
studied 
and 
proven 
highly 
uneconomical 
(in 
excess 
of 
US$l/m3 
to 
more 
than 
US$8/m3 
- 
desalination) 
andor 
socially 
controversial. 
If 
the 
water 
resource 
is 
to 
be 
preserved 
and 
protected 
for 
an 
extended 
life, 
there 
is 
no 
alternative 
to 
this 
project 
which 
aims 
at 
using 
water 
within 
the basin 
more 
efficiently 
by 
improveddemand 
management 
and 
increased 
recharge. 
Some 
highlights 
Hvdrologv 
The 
Sana'a 
basin 
is 
hydrologically 
self-contained, 
with 
very 
little 
outflow, 
only 
in 
years 
with 
heavy 
rainfall. Information 
on 
the 
more 
detailed 
hydrology 
of 
the 
Sana'a 
Basin 
is 
scant. 
Available 
data 
on 
storage 
and 
recharge 
stems 
and 
is 
extrapolated 
from 
studies 
and 
reports 
carried out 
and 
compiled 
in 
the 
1970's 
and 
1980's. 
Much 
of 
the data 
may 
have been 
copied 
from 
one 
report 
to 
another. 
There 
is 
no 
perennial 
surface 
water 
in 
all 
of 
Yemen. 
Annual 
average 
precipitation 
(past 
30 
years) 
is 
about 
700 
- 
800 
million 
cubic 
meters 
(MCM). 
Of 
that 
only 
about 5 percent 
infiltrates 
the 
ground 
and 
the rest 
evaporates. 
Another 
40 
MCM 
to 
80 
MCM 
seeps 
into 
the 
ground 
from 
irrigation 
and 
sewage 
return 
flows. 
The 
groundwater 
configuration 
- 
simplified 
- 
has 
two 
major 
strata: 
a 
shallow aquifer 
(alluvium 
and 
volcanic), 
with 
depths 
from 
30 
m 
to 
about 
70180 
m; 
a 
deep 
aquifer 
(Tawilah 
aquifer), 
slanting 
from 
north to 
south, 
with 
depths 
from 
less 
than 
100 
m 
to 
more 
than 
1,000 
m 
(see 
graph, 
below).

There 
is 
no 
perceptible 
recharge 
from 
the 
shallow 
to 
the 
deep 
aquifers 
(confirmed 
by 
isotope 
tests 
carried 
out 
by 
the International 
Atomic 
Energy 
Agency 
(MEA). 
Horizontal 
transmissivity 
within 
the 
Tawilah 
aquifer 
is 
estimated 
to 
be 
minimal. 
For 
practical 
purposes, 
the 
Tawilah 
water, characterized 
by 
high 
quality, 
may 
be 
considered a 
fossil 
aquifer. 
According 
to 
estimates 
derived 
from 
earlier 
studies, 
the 
economically 
exploitable 
deep 
aquifer stock 
is 
between 
2 
and 
3 
billion 
cubic 
meters 
(BCM). 
Water 
A 
bstractioniuse 
Groundwater 
use 
began 
to 
exceed recharge 
in 
the 
basin 
in 
the 
mid-1980s 
- 
the 
result 
of 
rapid 
expansion 
of 
irrigation, 
triggered 
by 
the 
introduction 
of 
the 
tubewell 
engine 
pumps 
and 
submersible 
pump 
technology 
in 
the 
seventies, 
plus 
subsidized 
diesel. 
Total 
water abstraction 
is 
about 
250 
MCM 
per 
year (about 
100 percent 
to 
150 percent 
higher 
than 
recharge). 
More 
than 
80 percent 
goes 
to 
irrigated 
agriculture 
(of 
which 
about 
half 
for 
qat 
- 
see 
below), 
with 
the 
balance 
for 
domestic 
and 
industrial 
use. 
Water 
abstraction 
is 
completely 
uncontrolled, 
unmetered, 
unlicensed 
and unpaid 
for. 
A 
recent 
well 
inventory 
(August 
2002) 
revealed 
about 
13,000 
wells 
in 
the 
Sana‘a 
Basin 
- 
and 
growing. 
Of 
these, 
only 
about 
70 
are state-owned 
for 
public 
water 
supply.

A 
farmer's 
first 
choice 
is 
to 
pump 
from 
the shallow 
aquifer. Once 
it 
is 
depleted, 
and 
if 
affordable, 
he 
will 
drill 
into 
the 
Tawilah 
aquifer, hence 
depleting 
the 
drinkingquality 
water. 
Water 
OualihdSana'a 
Wastewater 
Treatment 
Plant 
('WWT 
PI 
Infiltration from 
cess 
pits 
and the 
inadequate treatment 
of 
urban 
sewage 
results 
in 
high 
levels 
of 
biological 
contamination 
in 
the 
alluvial 
aquifer and 
in 
the 
fractured 
zones 
of 
the 
volcanic aquifer 
underlying 
the 
city 
of 
Sana'a (see 
basin 
geological 
cross-section, 
above). 
The 
WWTP 
was 
completed 
in 
mid-2000, 
but 
the 
quality 
of 
the treated 
effluent 
has 
been 
inconsistent 
since  the plant's 
commissioning. 
The plant 
is 
often 
been 
bypassed, 
especially 
during 
peak flows, 
energy 'black 
- 
or 
brown-outs' 
and 
when 
oil 
and 
slaughterhouse waste 
arrives 
with 
sewer, 
releasing 
untreated 
effluent 
into 
the 
wadi to 
the 
north 
of 
the 
plant. 
Effluent, 
treated 
or 
untreated, 
is 
used 
by 
about 
600 
farmers 
for 
irrigation 
of 
about 
300 
ha 
of 
land, 
including 
for 
vegetables. 
This 
poses 
high 
risks 
of 
public 
health 
for 
both 
the 
farmers 
and 
vegetable 
consumers, 
as 
well 
as 
for 
aquifer 
contamination.  Recent 
reviews 
indicate that 
substantial 
modification 
to 
the 
WWTP 
design 
may 
be required 
to 
guarantee 
safe 
effluent 
(see 
Section 
E-5, 
below). 
Water 
Legislation 
Until 
August 
31, 
2002, 
Yemen 
had 
no 
water 
law. The 
new 
Water 
Law 
is 
an 
excellent 
step 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
improved 
water 
management, 
but 
it 
still 
allows 
water 
abstraction 
without 
license 
up 
to 
80 
m 
depth; 
it 
has 
no 
provision 
for 
water abstraction 
metering, 
nor for 
levying 
a 
water 
charge 
for 
irrigation 
water. 
Oat 
Qat, 
a 
leaf from 
a tree 
or 
bush, 
when 
chewed 
has 
stimulating 
effects. 
Qat 
is 
a 
robust 
plant 
that 
can 
go 
without 
(or 
very 
little) 
water 
for 
years 
and 
even 
survives 
droughts. 
It 
grows 
under 
similar 
altitude 
and 
climatic 
conditions 
as 
does 
coffee, 
but 
only 
in 
frost 
and 
wind 
protected 
areas 
on 
the fringes 
of 
wadis, 
not 
in 
large 
plains. 
Thus, 
qat 
expansion 
is 
naturally 
limited, 
The 
use 
of 
qat 
is 
widespread 
and 
growing. 
It 
is 
controversial 
in 
terms 
of 
its 
socio-economic  impact. 
While 
it 
is 
highly 
profitable 
for 
farmers, 
it 
may 
devour 
as 
much 
as 
half 
of 
an 
average 
family's 
budget, 
thereby 
depriving 
families 
from 
other 
necessities 
and 
contributing 
to 
malnutrition, 
especially 
in 
children. 
Qat poses 
severe 
health 
hazards 
linked 
to 
uncontrolled 
pesticides spraying. 
A 
qat 
pest management 
plan 
is 
foreseen 
under 
the 
project. 
While 
the 
project 
is 
NOT 
supporting 
qat, 
it 
can 
not 
ignore 
it. 
Qat 
covers about 
half 
of 
the 
irrigated 
surface 
and 
consumes 
about 
half 
of 
irrigation 
water 
in 
the basin. 
Water 
savings 
from 
improved 
qat 
irrigation 
would 
make 
a 
significant impact 
in 
the 
overall 
water 
balance 
of 
the basin. 
Qat can 
not 
be 
excluded 
from 
the 
project. 
Short 
of 
selling 
water 
to 
the city, 
no 
alternative crop 
is 
as

profitable 
as 
qat 
for 
the farmer. Comparable 
switching 
values 
indicate 
that 
irrigating 
qat remains 
profitable 
with 
pumping 
of 
up 
to 
about 
800 
m 
depth. 
For 
vegetables 
and 
fruits, 
the 
next 
valuable 
crops 
of 
the 
basin, 
this 
value 
is 
only 
about 
300

to 
400 
m.

The 
larger 
qat issue 
is 
beyond 
the 
scope 
of 
this 
projectlAPL. 
A 
dialogue between 
the 
International 
Development Association 
(IDA) 
and 
GOY 
on 
qat 
and 
its 
socio-economic 
and 
health 
impacts has 
been ongoing 
for 
a 
number 
of 
years 
and 
continues.

The project 
- 
and indeed 
the 
APL 
- 
has 
to 
be 
seen 
against 
this 
rather 
complex 
backdrop. 
It 
is 
clearly 
a 
high 
riswhigh 
reward 
operation. 
Many 
of 
the methods 
proposed 
are 
untested 
in 
Yemen 
require 
close 
monitoring 
and 
amount 
largely 
to 
a 
'trial 
and error' 
approach. 
But 
embracing 
the 
project, 
may 
have 
far 
reaching benefits 
for 
the future 
of 
the country,  whose 
dependence 
on 
water 
is 
so 
crucial. 
Not 
doing 
it, 
would 
mean 
letting 
a

Project 
development objective: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
Out 
of 
about 
110,000 
ha 
of 
arable 
land, some 
24,000 
ha 
are 
irrigated. 
About 
12,000 
ha 
of 
these are 
in 
the 
project

(Phase 
I

of 
which 
about 
4,000

would initially 
be 
targeted 
for 
improved 
irrigation. 
The 
objective 
is 
to 
increase 
both 
the

In 
view 
of 
the severity 
of 
Yemen’s 
water scarcity 
(see 
2 
below), the 
new 
CAS 
(Report 
No. 
24372-YEM, 
August 
6, 
2002) 
highlighted 
the 
sustainability 
of 
water 
resources 
as 
one 
of 
the 
key 
objectives 
for 
the 
nation 
and 
for 
IDA 
assistance. 
As 
in 
the previous 
CAS 
(1999), 
the present 
CAS 
emphasizes 
improving 
water 
management 
for 
environmental sustainability and 
economic growth, 
as 
one 
of 
the 
four 
main 
focus 
areas, 
along 
with 
governance 
and 
public 
administration 
modernization, support 
to private 
investment 
and 
social improvements 
targeted 
at 
poverty 
alleviation. 
The 
proposed 
project 
has 
been 
identified 
by 
GOY 
and 
IDA 
within 
this 
context and 
is 
hlly 
consistent 
with 
the 
CAS. 
The 
CAS 
focus 
on 
improved 
water 
management 
is 
built 
on 
extensive 
analytical 
sector 
work 
carried out 
over the last 
five 
years 
by 
GOY 
in 
close 
collaboration 
with 
IDA. 
The 
main 
thrusts 
of 
this 
work 
are 
summarized 
in 
the 
following 
three reports: 
(i) 
the 
Water 
Sector Strategy (Report No.15718 
of 
August 
13, 
1997); 
(ii) 
the 
Agriculture 
Strategy 
(Report No.17973 
of 
September 
15, 
1998; 
and 
(iii) 
the 
Irrigation 
Sector 
Note 
issued 
in 
January 
1999. 
Also, 
consistent 
with 
the CAS, 
a 
programmatic, 
participatory, 
forward-looking 
extension 
of 
the 1997 
Water 
Sector Strategy 
is 
envisaged. 
2. 
Main 
sector 
issues 
and 
Government 
strategy: 
The dramatic 
nature 
of 
Yemen’s 
water 
scarcity, 
well 
documented 
in 
the  1997 
Water 
Strategy 
Report, 
identified four major 
challenges: 
(i) 
Institutions 
with 
limited 
capacity, have made 
it 
difficult 
to 
implement 
projects, 
in 
particular 
in 
the 
water 
sector. 
As 
a 
result, quasi-autonomous 
Project 
Management 
Units 
(PMUs), 
or 
Project 
Management 
Implementation 
Units 
(PIUs) 
were 
traditionally 
set 
up 
to 
implement projects 
in 
parallel to 
the 
line 
ministries 
and 
agencies. 
Recurrent 
costs 
of 
these 
units 
were 
paid 
under the 
project, 
This 
has, 
however, 
not 
been conducive 
to 
sustainable 
institution 
and 
capacity 
building 
and, 
in 
some 
cases, 
may 
have 
undermined the 
authority 
of 
line 
ministries 
or 
agencies. 
The 
GOY 
and 
IDA 
agreed 
to 
move 
away 
from 
this 
model 
and 
to shift 
to 
full 
implementation 
by 
line 
ministries 
and 
agencies. 
The 
proposed 
project 
is 
the 
first 
operation 
with 
the 
new 
approach. 
The physical 
components 
would 
be 
implemented 
by 
the 
line 
ministry 
and 
agency. 
A 
permanent 
Technical 
Secretariat 
to 
the 
Sana’a 
Basin 
Commission 
(TS-SBC) 
will 
be 
created. 
The 
TS-SBC 
will 
have 
oversight and 
monitoring 
responsibility 
of 
project 
implementation, 
as 
well 
as 
initially 
for 
project 
procurement 
and 
financial 
management 
(FM). 
Special 
training 
in 
procurement 
and 
FM 
will 
be 
provided 
by 
the 
project 
to 
the 
line 
ministrylagency. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
in 
Phase 
II 
of 
the 
APL 
these 
responsibilities 
may 
be 
devolved 
to 
the 
line 
ministrylagency. 
(ii) 
Groundwater 
mining 
threatening 
sustainability 
of 
the resource 
(water 
tables 
dropping 
in 
some 
areas 
up 
to six 
meters 
a 
year). 
(iii) 
Developing 
new 
affordable 
water 
resources 
for 
Yemen’s 
growing 
cities 
(Sana‘a 
City 
receives 
water 
from 
the 
public 
system 
only 
once 
every 
four 
days). 
(iv) 
Inadequate 
access 
to 
safe 
water 
and 
sanitation 
(less 
than 
half 
of 
Yemen’s 
population 
has 
access 
to 
drinking 
water 
and 
even fewer 
to 
safe 
sanitation). 
All 
of 
these 
challenges 
are 
present 
in 
the 
Sana’a 
Basin. 
IDA 
proposed 
an 
action 
agenda, 
including: 
(i) 
measures 
at the macro 
level 
(efficiency 
pricing for 
water, 
phasing  out 
of 
diesel 
subsidies, 
national 
debate 
on 
water 
uselconservation, 
reorientation 
of 
public 
expenditures, 
action 
on 
qat); 
(ii) 
drastically 
improved 
sector management 
(restructuring 
of 
the 
urban 
and 
-8- 
Page  13
rural 
water 
supply 
sectors, 
water conservation 
in 
agriculture 
and 
a 
regional 
approach 
to 
water 
planning); 
(iii) 
local level 
solutions 
(building 
on 
Yemen's 
tradition 
of 
community-based 
water 
management); 
and 
(iv) 
institutional 
development 
measures 
(adoption 
of 
a 
national 
water 
strategy, a 
water law, 
and 
capacity 
building 
for 
water 
institutions). 
Since 
1997, 
discussion 
within 
Yemen 
on 
the above 
agenda 
culminated 
in 
the 
adoption 
of 
a 
National 
Water  Strategy 
by 
the 
Council 
of 
Ministers 
in 
December 
1998, 
which 
broadly 
endorses 
the 
agenda 
discussed 
in 
IDA's 
1997 report.

to 
be 
further 
developed 
under 
the 
Urban Water

Adoption 
of 
a 
demand-driven approach 
to 
rural 
water 
supply 
(with 
IDA 
support 
under 
the 
ongoing

Adoption 
of 
a 
policy 
of 
cost 
recovery and 
hand-over 
of 
spate 
irrigation 
schemes 
to 
users 
(with 
IDA 
support 
under 
the 
ongoing 
Irrigation

Project). 
Implementation 
of 
a 
water conservation

in 
agriculture 
and 
the creation 
of 
a 
mechanism 
to 
promote 
it 
(under 
the 
recently 
completed 
Land 
and Water 
Conservation 
Project 
(LWCP)  and the 
Groundwater and 
Soil 
Conservation Project 
(GSCP), 
under 
preparation). 
Initiation 
of

(GDI) 
and

completed 
dam 
inventory 
for 
Sana'a 
Basin 
(funded  under 
the 
ongoing 
Southern Governorates 
Rural 
Development 
Project). 
Approval 
by 
Parliament 
of 
a 
Water

in 
July 
2002,

on 
August 
3

by 
H.E. 
President 
Saleh, 
followed 
by 
Cabinet 
Decrees, 
declaring 
the basins 
of 
Sa'ada, 
Sana'a 
and 
Tai'iz 
as 
'protected

under 
Article 
49 
of

Decree 
in 
September 
2002 
(Decree 
# 
263,2002 
of 
September 
10,2002). 
The 
challenge 
is 
enormous 
and 
many 
years 
of 
sustained 
commitment 
at 
all 
levels 
will 
be 
needed 
to 
achieve 
a 
measurable 
impact. 
Though 
GOY'S 
actions 
point 
in 
the 
right 
direction, 
so 
far 
there 
has 
been 
little 
discernible impact 
on 
the ground, 
especially 
on 
those 
aspects 
of 
sector 
reform 
that 
could 
contribute 
to 
controlling 
groundwater 
mining. 
IDA's 
approach 
is 
to 
support 
Yemen 
in 
moving 
towards 
a 
viable 
strategy, 
a 
national 
debate 
on 
groundwater conservation, 
vastly 
improved public 
awareness 
and 
by 
testing 
solutions 
on 
the 
ground. 
The 
proposed 
projectlprogram 
is 
the 
key 
vehicle 
for 
pushing forward 
changes 
in 
water 
resource 
management.

Sector 
issues 
to 
be 
addressed 
by 
the project and 
strategic 
choices: 
The 
proposed 
project 
would 
address 
key 
sector 
issues 
on 
water resource 
management. 
(a) 
Water 
rights 
and 
regulation. 
Traditional 
water 
right 
systems 
deal adequately 
with 
surface 
water 
but 
do 
not 
provide 
a 
workable 
framework 
for 
groundwater. 
Groundwater 
exploitation 
is 
essentially 
unregulated. 
The 
owner 
of 
each 
of 
Yemen's 
50,000-100,000 
wells 
(13,000 
wells 
in 
the 
Sana'a 
Basin) 
is 
sovereign 
master 
of 
how 
much 
to 
pump. 
The 
"law 
of 
capture" prevails, 
and 
the 
incentives 
favor 
competitive 
mining 
over 
conservation. 
With 
the 
objective 
of 
changing 
pumping 
behavior, 
the 
proposed 
project 
would 
help 
draft 
and implement 
bylaws 
for 
the 
new 
Water  Law. 
As 
a 
priority, 
for 
the  'protected 
zones', 
the 
project 
would 
help 
build 
up 
monitoring 
capacity 
and 
introduce 
a 
system 
of 
self-regulation 
by 
water 
users. 
Future 
groundwater 
exploitation 
would be 
subject 
to 
licensing 
in 
advance. 
The 
new 
law 
gives 
NWRA 
these 
powers, 
but 
also 
allows 
delegation 
to 
stakeholder 
groups, 
for 
example, 
WAS 
for 
water management 
at 
the 
local 
level. 
(b) 
The 
new 
Water 
Law 
is 
key 
to 
an  effective 
water 
management program. 
It 
is 
an  important 
achievement, 
especially 
with 
water 
management 
at 
the 
center 
of 
the 
new 
CAS  for 
IDA 
interventions. 
Yet, 
the 
new 
Law 
has 
several 
significant 
flaws, 
most 
of 
which 
can 
not 
be 
simply 
'corrected' 
through 
bylaws, 
because 
the 
basic 
provisions 
are absent 
in 
the 
Law. 
These 
are 
the 
four 
key 
issues: 
(i) 
The 
Law 
does 
not 
provide 
for 
water abstraction 
measuring; 
(ii) 
The 
Law 
does 
not 
provide 
for 
levying 
of 
water 
charges; 
(iii)The 
Law 
allows 
well-diggingldrilling 
up 
to 
60 
m 
without 
a license, 
plus, 
it 
allows 
a deepening 
of 
any 
well 
by 
20 
m 
once 
(who 
is 
monitoring 
?) 
without 
a license, 
which 
makes 
effectively 
wells 
up 
to 
80 
m 
depth 
license-free; 
and 
(iv)The 
Law 
grandfathers 
all 
past 
water 
rights, 
plus 
gives 
water 
rights 
to wells 
drilled 
after  the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
Law. 
At 
the 
same 
time, each 
well 
may 
be 
registered 
within 
three 
years 
from 
effectiveness of  the 
Law, 
thus 
encouraging 
farmers 
to 
drill 
as 
many 
wells 
as 
possible 
without 
license, 
from 
now 
to 
the 
middle 
of 
2005, 
when 
all 
wells 
have 
to 
be 
registered. 
This 
would 
increase farmers'  water 
rights, 
which 
- 
based 
on 
current abstraction 
- 
already exceed 
renewable 
resources 
by 
100 
percent 
to 
150 
percent. 
These 
shortcomings 
are 
a 
significant 
hindrance 
for 
effective 
water 
management. 
After 
consultation 
with 
IDA 
and 
other 
donors, 
GOY 
decided 
to 
declare 
under 
Article 
49 
of 
the 
Water Law, 
the 
basins 
of 
Sana'a, 
Sa'ada 
and 
Tai'iz, 
as 
'protected 
zones' 
(Cabinet 
Decrees 
# 
343 
to 
346, 
of 
November 
19, 
2002). 
This 
mitigates 
the 
law's 
flaws 
in 
the 
three 
most 
water 
scarce 
areas 
of 
the 
country.  Special 
bylaws 
will 
be 
drafted 
for 
these 
'protected 
zones' 
and 
the 
Water 
Law 
at large 
with 
IDA'S 
assistance. 
(c) 
The 
capacity 
for 
institutional 
arrangements 
to 
improved 
water 
management 
is 
insufficient 
and 
fragmented. 
Public 
institutions 
often 
lack 
authority over 
tribal 
structures and the 
strong autonomy 
of 
local 
water 
users. 
Experience 
shows 
that enforcement 
can 
only 
be 
successful 
on 
a 
partnership 
basis, 
through 
a system 
of 
self-regulation. 
The 
project 
would 
couple 
regulation 
with 
a 
participatory 
water 
resource management approach 
and 
a 
public 
information 
and 
awareness 
program 
(see 
details 
in 
Section 
C-4). 
Social 
consciousness 
is 
crucial 
for 
protecting 
the 
limited 
water resources 
of 
the 
basin 
and 
to 
engendering support 
for 
the 
regulatory activities required 
to 
conserve 
these resources. 
The project 
would, 
therefore: 
(i) 
Develoo 
NWRA's 
capacitv 
for 
water 
resources management.  Sections 
C-2 
and 
C-4 
below 
- 
10- 
Page  15
describe 
NWRA's 
future 
role 
in 
the 
proposed 
project 
in 
detail. 
Broadly, 
NWRA 
through 
a 
recently 
created 
Sana'a 
Branch, 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
implementation 
and monitoring 
of 
a 
comprehensive 
regulatory 
system (bylaws) based 
on 
the 
decree 
declaring the 
Sana'a 
Basin 
as 
a 
'protected 
zone' 
(see 
above). 
The project 
would 
support 
an 
intensive 
capacity-building program 
for 
the 
NWRA 
Sana'a 
Branch. 
(ii) 
Promote 
an institutional framework 
in 
which 
the 
NWRA 
Sana'a 
Branch 
(see 
below) 
would 
delegate management 
of 
the 
resource 
to 
the most 
decentralized 
feasible 
level 
- 
to 
stakeholder 
organizations 
wherever possible. 
Peer 
enforcement and 
self-regulation 
are 
likely 
to 
be 
the best 
way 
in 
Yemeni 
conditions 
to 
ensure 
prudent water 
management. 
Stakeholder organizations 
would 
be 
created 
where 
needed. 
They 
would 
be 
built 
on 
existing 
social 
structures such 
as 
LCs, 
water 
user cooperatives, associations, 
and 
community 
organizations. 
(iii)Build 
up 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
recently 
created 
s, 
with 
a 
long-term 
view 
to 
convert 
it 
into 
a 
Sana'a 
Basin 
Agency 
(SBA). 
(iv) 
Strengthen 
GDI's 
technical, 
financial 
and 
procurement 
capacity 
for 
its 
vital 
role 
in 
irrigation 
improvement and 
dam 
construction. 
(d) 
Save 
water 
in 
agriculture, 
and 
make 
saved 
water available 
for 
higher 
value 
uses 
in 
the 
basin. 
As 
elsewhere 
in 
Yemen, 
irrigation efficiency 
is 
low. 
Achieving project 
and 
program 
objectives 
will 
depend 
largely 
on 
water savings 
in 
irrigation. 
Techniques 
for 
irrigation 
improvement 
are 
known 
and 
have been demonstrated 
under the completed 
IDA-financed LWCP. Under 
the proposed project, the 
focus 
would 
be 
on 
forging 
a 
partnership between 
the 
GOY 
and 
farmers 
to 
increase 
the water 
use 
efficiency 
through 
modem  irrigation 
technologies, 
to 
confine  agriculture  increasingly 
to 
the 
enhanced 
use 
of 
rainfall, 
and 
to 
extract 
irrigation 
water 
from 
the 
shallow 
aquifers.  Farmers 
would 
be 
offered 
an 
incentives and Rules 
package 
to 
adopt 
improved irrigation 
technologies, 
under 
which 
they 
would 
also 
commit 
themselves 
not 
to 
expand 
their 
irrigation 
perimeters 
(C-4 
- 
Package 
of 
'Incentives 
and 
Rules').

to 
maximize 
water 
conservation. 
To 
progress 
from 
one phase 
to 
another, 
a 'trigger'

would 
be 
set 
up.

C. 
Program and 
Project Description 
Summary 
1. 
Project 
components 
(see 
Annex 
2 
for 
a 
detailed description 
and 
Annex 
3 
for 
a 
detailed 
cost 
breakdown): 
Project activities 
would 
focus 
on 
10 
sub-basins 
(out 
of 
22 
in 
the entire Basin) 
in 
four 
representative 
Basin 
zones: 
in 
the Western Area 
(southem 
Hamdan 
and 
Bani 
Matar 
districts); 
South Eastern Area 
(Bani 
Bahloul, 
eastern 
part 
of 
Sanhan 
districts);  Eastern 
Area 
(Bani 
Hushaish, 
northern 
Bani 
AI 
Harith, 
part 
of 
Khawlen 
districts); 
and 
North 
Eastem 
Area 
(Nihm, 
and 
part 
of 
Arhab 
districts) 
- 
see 
map 
for 
details. 
Small 
dam 
rehabilitation, 
according 
to 
priorities 
based 
on 
safety 
criteria, 
would 
be 
basin-wide. 
The 
areas 
were selected 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
(i) 
representativeness 
of 
the 
sub-basins; 
(ii) 
high 
chance 
of 
success 
in 
meeting 
project 
goals; 
and 
(iii) 
favorable 
environmental 
impact 
on 
the 
selected 
sub-basins, 
Le.: 
(i) 
scope 
for 
irrigation 
improvement and 
reduction 
in 
groundwater 
abstraction; 
(ii) 
favorable 
socioeconomic conditions, 
triballethnic 
homogeneity, 
and 
communities' 
willingness 
to 
participate; 
(iii) 
positive 
impact 
on 
the 
potential 
recharge; 
and 
(iv) 
scope 
for 
supply 
structures 
(dams) 
development 
and 
improvement. 
(a)  Demand 
Management 
and 
Irrigation 
Improvement 
(Total 
cost 
US$I 
1.7 
million) 
This 
component 
seeks 
to 
achieve  water  savings 
and 
conservation 
in 
agriculture 
by 
increasing the 
efficiency 
of 
water 
use 
for 
irrigation 
through 
introduction 
of 
modem irrigation 
technologies. 
The 
component 
would 
focus 
on all 
or 
part 
of 
the 
10 
selected 
sub-basins. 
However, 
out 
of 
the 
total 
12,500 
ha 
irrigated 
land 
of 
these 
sub-basins, 
the 
project 
would initially 
target  about 
4,000 
ha. 
These 
areas 
have 
proven the most 
suitable 
during 
stakeholder 
assessments 
in 
the course 
of 
project 
preparation. 
Activities 
would 
include: 
Water 
Conservation: 
Physical interventions under 
this 
component 
would 
be 
demand-driven 
with 
an incentive 
system 
(see 
C-4 
(vi), 
below). 
Improved overall irrigation 
efficiencies 
in 
the target 
area are 
expected through: 
(a) 
upgrades 
of 
existing 
piped delivery 
systems; 
(b) 
conversions 
of 
open channel 
to 
piped 
delivery 
systems; 
and 
(c) 
introduction 
of 
modem 
pressurized 
irrigation to 
fields 
already 
served 
by 
satisfactorily 
piped delivery 
systems. 
Also 
included 
may 
be 
up 
to 
300 
ha 
of 
land 
leveling, 
plastic 
tunnelslcovers 
for 
technology  demonstration 
purposes 
and 
wadi 
protection 
works 
in 
vulnerable 
areas. 
To 
reduce 
the 
risk 
of 
irrigation 
expansion,  pipes 
for 
conveyance 
systems 
would, 
wherever possible, 
be 
PVC 
rather than 
steel 
to 
make 
diversion 
of 
water 
to 
new 
areas 
more 
difficult. 
(ii) 
Communitv 
Organization: 
The project 
will 
be 
advertised 
in 
the 
selected 
sub-basins, 
and farmer 
groups 
(usually  around 
a 
well) 
interested 
in 
participating 
will 
register 
with 
the 
Local 
Council 
(LC) 
or 
the TS-SBC 
(see 
(9 
ii, 
below). 
They 
will 
then 
be 
visited 
by 
a 
social 
mobilization 
team 
([SMT] 
- 
see 
Institutional 
Arrangements) 
to 
discuss 
obligations 
and benefits 
of 
participation. 
The 
SMT 
will 
help 
with 
the  creation 
of 
community-based 
WAS. 
These 
WAS, 
the 
most 
decentralized 
legally 
established 
institutional 
entities, 
would 
be 
supported 
by 
the technical 
and 
managerial 
training 
and 
extension 
programs, 
carried out 
by 
GDI 
through 
the 
SMTs. 
(b) 
Supply 
Management 
and Recharge 
Improvement 
(Total 
cost US$10.2 
million) 
This 
component 
would 
enhance 
and 
accelerate 
groundwater 
recharge 
through 
mostly 
small 
conventional 
dams, 
sub-surface 
dams 
and 
other structures. 
It 
is 
expected 
that farmers 
would 
then 
pump 
from 
shallow 
aquifers 
instead 
of 
the 
deep 
aquifers 
which 
are 
a 
critical 
supply 
source 
of 
drinking 
water 
for 
urban 
and 
rural 
domestic 
use. 
The project 
would 
(i) 
build 
five 
recharge structures, 
including 
four 
dams (one 
of 
18 
- 
12- 
Page  17
m, 
one 
of 
16 
m 
and 
others 
of 
less 
than 
10 
m 
height)  and 
a 
series 
of 
low 
cascading 
check 
structures. 
During 
implementation, 
other 
potentially viable 
recharge technologies,  such 
as 
underground 
dams 
to 
catch 
sub-surface 
flows 
in 
wadis, 
spate 
breakers 
and water harvesting 
structures, 
would 
also 
be 
studied; 
(ii) 
rehabilitate existing 
hill 
dams 
to 
prevent 
potential 
dam 
failure 
as 
well 
as 
to 
recover recharge 
capacity 
diminished 
by 
accumulated 
sediments; 
and 
(iii) 
establish 
a sustainable 
dam 
management 
system

(i) 
Regulatory 
Framework  Develoument  and 
Application: 
Given 
the 
flaws 
of 
the 
Water  Law,  the 
project 
would 
support 
and 
assist 
NWRA 
with 
the 
drafting 
and 
finalizing 
of 
bylaws and 
regulations 
to 
mitigate 
some 
of 
the shortcomings of 
the law. 
Subsequently, 
regulatory 
systems 
and 
procedures 
for 
water 
rights 
management, 
including 
for 
registration 
and 
permits 
of 
well 
users 
and 
drillers, 
will 
be 
developed and applied. 
The 
Sana’a 
Basin 
may 
become a 
demonstration 
model 
for 
the 
country. 
(ii) 
Basin 
Water 
Management: 
The 
new 
NWRA 
Sana’a 
Branch 
will 
assume 
responsibility 
for 
overall 
basin-wide 
water resources 
investigation, 
regulation 
and 
monitoring. 
This 
will 
include, delegation 
to 
- 
13- 
Page  18
user groups 
and 
monitoring 
of 
the 
regulatory 
system, 
overview 
and 
execution 
of 
water 
resource 
research 
and 
monitoring 
programs 
in 
coordination 
with 
other responsible 
agencies 
and 
stakeholder 
groups 
(see 
below). 
It 
will 
also 
include 
supporting 
the 
evolution 
and 
operations 
of 
the 
SBC 
(representing 
all 
water 
sector stakeholders) 
in 
an 
equitable 
and 
sustainable 
development 
and 
use 
of 
the 
basin's 
water 
resources. 
The project 
will 
support the 
NWRA 
Sana'a 
Branch and 
the SBC 
in 
the 
development 
of 
capabilities 
in 
all 
of 
these 
areas, 
with 
training, 
technical 
assistance 
and 
equipment. 
(iii) 
Basin 
Hvdrorreolo~cal 
and Water 
Resources 
Investigations and 
Monitoring: 
For 
the 
project 
area, 
systems 
will 
be 
developed, 
where 
possible, 
through 
community 
management 
to 
monitor 
and 
record 
climate, 
rainfall, 
wadi 
flows 
and 
groundwater  levels. 
Investigations  and 
studies 
will 
include: 
(a) 
analysis 
of 
project 
impacts 
through 
dam 
and 
other 
wadi 
structures 
on 
aquifer 
recharge 
and 
groundwater 
levels 
(covering 
also 
rehabilitation 
dams 
outside  the 
four 
sub-basin 
zones); 
(b) 
exploratory 
deep 
boreholes; 
(c) 
physical 
surveys 
and 
laboratory 
testing 
for 
aquifer 
modeling 
to 
gain 
a 
better understanding 
of 
the basin's 
hydrogeological 
characteristics 
and 
of 
the 
groundwater 
balance; 
(d) 
satellite 
imagerylaerial 
photography at 
three 
points 
in 
time 
during 
the course 
of 
the 
project 
to 
analyze 
and quantify  project 
impacts 
on 
cropping and irrigated 
areas; 
and 
(e) 
field 
level 
water 
balance 
assessments 
at 
similar intervals 
to 
determine 
the effects 
of 
irrigation 
system 
improvements 
on 
water 
use. 
These 
programs 
will 
be 
coordinated between 
NWRA 
Sana'a 
Branch 
and 
relevant 
Ministry 
of 
Agriculture 
and 
irrigation 
(MAI) 
departments. 
Support 
for 
equipment  and 
technical 
assistance 
(TA) 
will 
be 
provided 
under 
the 
project. 
The 
investigations 
may 
need 
to 
be 
extended 
to 
areas 
outside 
of 
the 
basin 
to 
cover 
potential additional 
water 
sources 
not 
previously 
studied, 
e.g,, 
the 
aquifer 
under 
the sparsely 
populated 
desert 
area 
of 
Ramlat 
Assaba'atain. 
(d) 
Information 
and 
Public 
Awareness 
Campaign 
(Total 
cost US$1.2 
million) 
Despite 
past 
GOY'S 
efforts  at 
raising 
public 
awareness 
of 
the 
severe 
water 
scarcity 
in 
the 
Sana'a 
Basin, 
the 
level 
of 
understanding 
of 
the 
impending crisis 
among 
the 
public 
at 
large, 
including 
many 
politicians 
and decision 
makers, 
is 
still 
weak. 
The 
IPAC 
would 
be carried 
out 
by 
the 
NWRA 
Sana'a 
Branch, 
through 
a 
specially-staffed 
IPAC 
unit 
(C-4, 
below), 
in 
close 
collaboration 
with 
the  TS-SBC. 
The 
IPAC 
component 
would 
consist 
of an 
intense 
program 
to 
convey 
nuanced 
messages 
of 
water 
conservation 
to 
well-targeted 
population 
segments. 
Specifically 
it 
would 
address: 
(i) 
schools, 
both 
teachers 
and 
students; 
(ii) 
parliamentarians; 
(iii) 
journalists; 
(iv) 
small 
and 
large 
farmers; 
(v) 
women 
(through 
health 
centers 
and 
hospitals), 
and 
men 
(through 
WAS 
and 
LC 
meetings); 
(vi) 
industrial 
users; 
and 
(vii) 
rural 
and 
urban 
domestic interests 
groups, 
The 
campaign, 
designed 
as 
an 
initial 
four-year program, 
would 
likely 
continue 
as 
an 
open-ended 
endeavor 
to 
conserve 
the 
livelihood 
of 
the 
basin. 
It 
would 
use 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
media, 
such 
as 
TV, 
radio, 
newspapers, 
seminars, 
and 
focus groups 
(a 
detailed 
IPAC 
implementation 
plan 
is 
in 
the 
project 
file). 
(e) 
Environmental 
Management 
Plan 
and 
Mitigation 
Program 
(Total 
cost US$0.7 
million) 
The 
proposed 
project 
is 
essentially 
aiming 
at 
improving 
the 
overall 
environmental 
situation 
of 
the 
Sana'a 
Basin, 
notably 
through water 
resource conservation, 
pollution 
prevention 
and 
improving 
environmental 
health 
conditions. 
Partly 
due 
to 
the 
construction 
of 
recharge 
dams 
(of 
which 
only 
two 
exceed 
the 
15 
m 
statutory 
limit 
- 
one 
of 
16 
m, 
another one of  18 
m), 
and 
partly 
because 
of 
the 
project's 
complexity 
and 
social 
sensitivity 
(dealing 
with 
a 
scarce resource), 
the 
project 
has 
been 
rated 
as 
an 
Environmental 
Categow 
A 
operation,  thereby 
triggering 
a 
full 
Environmental  Impact 
Assessment 
(EIA) 
with 
an 
Environmental 
Management 
Plan 
(EMP) 
and 
Mitigation 
Program 
(see 
Annex 
2). 
Evaluations carried out 
under 
the 
EIA 
concluded that 
other 
than 
Dam 
Safety 
(OPIBP 
4.37), 
Involuntary 
Resettlement (and 
Land 
Acquisition) 
(OPlBP 
4.12) 
and 
Pest 
Management 
(OP 
4.09), 
none 
of 
the Safeguards 
were 
triggered. 
A 
-14- 
Page  19
dam 
safety 
report 
has 
been  prepared. 
Its 
Executive 
Summary 
is 
part 
of 
the 
EM. 
A 
model 
Pest 
Management 
Plan 
(PMP) for 
grapes, 
the 
most prevalent 
crop 
other than 
qat, 
has 
also 
been 
prepared (also 
included 
in 
the 
EIA). 
Due 
to 
the 
high 
prevalence 
of 
qat 
in 
the 
basin 
and 
its 
indiscriminate 
spraying 
with 
uncontrolled 
pesticides,  the 
proiect 
would 
also  design 
a 
qat 
PMP 
within 
six 
months 
of 
Proiect 
Effectiveness. 
Although 
no 
involuntary 
resettlement 
is 
expected, 
an 
Involuntary 
Resettlement and 
Land 
Acquisition 
Framework 
has 
been prepared 
(Part 
of 
the 
Ea). 
Mitigation 
measures 
and 
related 
costs €or 
these 
Safeguards 
are 
described 
in 
Section 
E-5 
and 
Annex 
2, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
the 
EIA.

Project Management and 
Monitoring 
(Total

US$l.5 million) 
(i) 
The 
long-term idea 
is 
to 
move 
towards basin water 
management, 
through 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
SBA. 
As 
an 
initial 
step, 
the 
SBC 
was 
recently 
created 
by 
Prime 
Minister 
Decree (Section 
B-2, 
above). 
The 
SBC 
is 
chaired 
by 
the 
Mayor 
of 
Sana'a 
City.  Membership 
consists 
of 
a 
broad 
stakeholder 
representation, 
including, 
the 
Office 
of 
the 
Governor 
of 
Sana'a, 
Ministry 
of 
Planning 
and 
Development 
(MOPD), 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
(MOF), 
Ministry 
of 
Information, 
Ministry 
of 
Interior, 
Ministry 
of 
Electricity 
and 
Water  (MEW), 
MAI, 
NWRA, 
NWRA 
Sana'a 
Branch, 
Sana'a 
Local 
Corporation, 
Agricultural 
Cooperative 
Union 
(ACU), 
representatives 
of 
WAS, 
Water 
User 
Federations 
(WUFs) 
and 
LCs. 
The 
SBC 
may 
be 
extended 
as 
warranted. 
The 
feasibility 
and 
modalities 
of 
an 
SBA, that 
may 
evolve 
from 
the 
SBC 
and 
become 
a 
model 
for 
future basin 
agencies, 
would 
be studied 
during 
the 
early 
stages 
of 
project 
implementation. 
(ii) 
TS-SBC 
would 
be 
created (extension 
of 
current 
Project 
Preparation Team 
unit) 
under 
the 
SBC. 
The 
tasks 
and 
responsibilities 
of 
the 
TS-SBC 
would 
include, 
overall 
project 
coordination, 
monitoring 
(including  EMP),  project 
procurement  and 
FM, 
institutionaUcapacity 
buildingtraining 
activities, 
including 
support 
to 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Public 
Health 
and 
Population's 
(MOPHP) 
Bilharzia mitigation 
program, 
and 
as 
needed 
to 
implement 
the 
EMP. 
In 
addition, 
the TS-SBC 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
preparation 
of 
Phase 
11 
of 
the 
SBWM 
APL. 
(iii)The 
Demand 
and 
Supply 
Management  components 
would 
be  implemented 
by 
the 
line 
ministry 
(MAL'GDI), 
through an 
expanded 
existing Project Implementation 
Unit 
from 
the 
LWCP 
that has 
been 
fully 
integrated 
into 
the 
ministry. 
Tasks 
and 
responsibilities 
would 
include 
design, 
implementation, 
SMTs, 
monitoring,  capacity 
buildingtraining, 
including 
to 
Department 
of 
Plant 
Protection 
(DPP) 
and 
WGDI, 
coordination 
with 
SSARDA 
and 
the 
Agricultural 
and 
Fisheries 
Promotion 
Fund 
(AFPF), 
which 
carry 
out, 
or 
finance 
similar 
activities. 
An 
FMS, 
compatible 
with 
the 
project 
FMS 
in 
the 
TS-SBC, 
would 
be 
set 
up 
and 
assisted 
with 
training 
to 
build 
an 
independent, 
transparent 
FMS 
in 
MAI. 
Training 
would 
also 
be 
provided 
for 
procurement 
management. 
(iv) 
The 
NWRA 
Sana'a 
Branch 
would 
receive 
TA 
for 
capacity 
building 
and 
training to 
fulfill 
its 
role 
as 
a 
basin 
manager (water  resource use 
and 
recharge 
monitoringlplanning, 
water 
quality 
control)  and 
implementer 
of 
the 
Water 
Law. 
In 
addition, the 
IPAC 
component 
would 
be implemented 
through 
a 
special 
unit 
within 
the 
NWRA 
Sana'a 
Branch 
and 
funded under the project.

Key 
policy 
and 
institutional reforms 
supported 
by 
the 
project: 
Some 
of 
the 
policies 
and institutional reforms 
that 
would 
be 
sought 
under 
the 
project 
are 
essential 
for 
the 
Sana'a 
Basin; others 
are 
of 
broader 
application 
throughout 
the 
country: 
(i) 
Following 
the 
approval 
by 
Parliament 
of 
the 
Water 
Law, 
and 
the 
decree 
to 
declare the basins 
of 
Sana'a 
, 
Sa'ada 
and 
Tai'iz 
as 
'protected 
zones', 
a 
related regulatorv framework 
[bvlaws) 
is 
needed 
to: 
(a) 
address 
the 
'protected 
zones', 
and 
(b) 
mitigate 
some 
of 
the Law's 
flaws 
(see 
Section 
B-3, 
above). 
The 
framework 
would 
include registration 
and 
regulation 
of 
groundwater 
rights, 
defining 
NWRA's 
role 
and 
powers 
in 
water 
management, 
and 
delegating 
management 
and enforcement 
powers 
to 
decentralized, 
local level 
institutions 
to 
self-regulate water 
use. 
The 
bylaws 
for 
the 
'protected 
zones' 
should 
have the objective 
of 
gradually 
and 
over 
time 
limiting 
abstraction 
to 
the 
annual 
natural 
recharge 
and, 
as 
a 
priority, 
averting 
the 
risk 
of 
aquifer 
pollution 
from 
the 
WWTP. 
They 
should include: 
(a) 
a 
ban 
on 
well 
drilling 
for 
agriculturallirrigation 
use; 
(b) 
licensing 
of 
all 
wells, 
irrespective 
of 
depth; 
(c) 
mandatory water abstraction 
metering; 
(d) 
a 
provision 
that 
may 
allow 
over 
time 
levying 
water 
charges 
for 
agriculturallirrigation 
use; 
(e) 
the 
improvementlrehabilitation 
of 
the 
Sana'a 
WWTP; 
and 
(vi) 
mechanisms 
for 
monitoring 
and 
enforcement 
of 
effluent quality and 
adherence 
to 
the 
bylaws. 
(ii) 
NWRA. 
A 
NWRA 
Sana'a 
Branch 
has 
been established 
(see 
'Institutional 
and 
Social 
Development, 
Capacity 
Building', 
above). 
(iii)= 
has been created 
(see 
'Project Management', 
above).

]Benefits 
and 
target 
population: 
The 
principal 
benefits 
and beneficiaries 
of 
the 
Project 
would 
be 
as 
follows: 
(i) 
An 
extension 
of 
the 
useful 
life 
of 
groundwater resources 
in 
the 
basin 
through 
water 
savings. 
A 
total 
of 
8 
MCM 
would 
be 
saved 
annually through 
project 
activities, 
of 
which 
7 
MCMlyear from 
irrigation 
improvement 
on 
about 
4,000 
ha 
and 
about 
1 
MCMlyear from 
the 
construction  and 
rehabilitation 
of 
dams. 
Beneficiaries 
would 
primarily 
be 
the 
people 
in 
the 
project 
area, 
including 
Sana'a 
City 
(almost 
all 
of 
the 
1.5 
million 
people 
in 
the 
basin). 
(ii) 
Decrease 
the 
likelihood 
of 
human 
and 
socio-economic 
losses 
associated 
with 
dam 
failure. 
Beneficiaries 
are 
the people downstream 
of 
the 
dam 
estimated 
at 
about 
6,000. 
4. 
Institutional 
and 
implementation 
arrangements: 
Physical 
components, 
i.e. 
supply 
and 
demand 
management, 
would be 
implemented 
through 
the 
respective 
line 
ministries 
or 
agencies 
(MA1 
and 
NWRA 
Sana'a 
Branch), 
The latter 
would 
be 
particularly 
in 
charge 
of 
implementing 
a 
water 
monitoring 
and abstraction 
regulation 
system. 
Overall project 
coordination 
and 
monitoring 
would 
be 
entrusted 
to 
the TS-SBC 
attached 
to 
the 
SBC 
(see 
Institutional 
Development 
and 
Capacity 
Building, 
and 
Project 
Management 
and 
Monitoring, C-1 
above). 
The 
following 
institutions 
will 
be 
involved 
in 
project 
implementation: 
National 
Level 
(i) 
s. 
(See 
'Project Management 
and Monitoring",  C-1 
(f) 
above). 
(ii) 
The 
TS-SBC 
would 
report technically 
to 
the 
SBC. 
While 
project 
budgets 
would 
be 
approved 
annually 
by 
the 
SBC, 
project 
funds 
(local 
and 
foreign) 
would 
flow 
directly 
from 
Finance 
to 
the 
TS-SBC. 
The 
TS-SBC 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
overall 
project 
coordination, 
monitoring, 
budgeting, 
accountinglfinancial 
management, 
procurement 
and 
disbursement. 
It 
would initially 
function 
as 
the 
Technical 
Secretariat 
of 
the 
SBC, 
later 
it 
would 
be 
fully 
integrated 
into 
the 
Sana'a 
Basin 
Agency, 
if 
such 
an 
agency was 
to 
be 
created. 
TS-SBC 
key 
staff 
would 
include 
six local 
staff: 
(a) 
a 
TS-SBC 
Manager, 
expert 
in 
water 
resources 
engineering 
and 
water 
management; 
(b) 
a 
social 
and 
WUA 
development  specialist; 
(c) 
a 
procurement 
and 
contracts  management specialist: 
(d) 
a 
program 
and 
progress 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
specialist; 
(e) 
a 
financial 
management  specialist; 
(f) 
a 
full 
time 
environmental 
monitoring 
specialist; 
and 
(g) 
an 
executive 
secretary. 
Funding 
for 
a 
number 
of 
short-term 
international 
TA 
consultants 
would 
also 
be 
made available. 
Specific 
terms 
of 
reference 
(TORs) 
would 
clarify 
the 
roles, 
responsibilities, 
and powers 
of 
the TS-SBC, 
and relationships between the 
TS-SBC 
and 
other 
agencies, 
such 
as 
NWRA; 
SBC; 
the 
implementing 
line 
ministries 
or 
agencies 
(MAI, 
NWRA 
Sana'a 
Branch) 
and 
stakeholder 
groups 
(WAS, 
WUFs, 
LCs). 
The 
TS-SBC 
would 
also 
work 
with 
other 
agencies 
and 
private 
companies, 
as 
far 
as 
possible, 
on 
a 
contract 
basis. 
The 
TORs 
for 
the TS-SBC 
and 
staffing 
plan 
are 
included 
in 
the 
Project Implementation 
Manual 
(PIM). 
(iii) 
NWRA, 
responsible 
for 
country-wide 
water 
resource 
monitoring 
and 
management, 
has 
currently 
two 
branch 
offices 
in 
Tai'z 
and 
Aden. 
The 
NWRA 
Sana'a 
Branch 
would 
be responsible 
mainly 
for 
-17- 
Page  22
implementing, 
enforcing 
and 
monitoring 
the 
Water 
Law 
(see 
'Institutional 
and 
Social 
Development', 
above) 
and 
the 
implementation 
of 
IPAC 
(see 
C-1,  above). 
The 
IPAC 
Unit 
would 
be 
staffed 
by 
an 
international 
communicationslpublic  relations expert 
and three 
local 
experts 
with 
a 
background 
in 
communication, 
social 
sciences, 
and psychology. 
The 
team 
would 
receive basic 
training 
from 
an 
international 
consultant 
and regular 
refresher 
courses 
thereafter. 
(iv) 
MAZIGDI 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
physical implementation 
of: 
(a) 
Demand Management: 
irrigation

works 
(as 
described 
in 
Section 
C-1, 
above). 
The  existing 
project 
unit 
would 
be 
expanded 
as 
needed. 
It 
should 
include 
at 
least 
an 
imgation 
engineerlprocurement 
specialist, 
a 
social  scientist 
and 
an 
accountantlFM 
specialistladministrator; 
and 
(b) 
Sumlv 
Management: 
the construction 
of 
five 
new 
dams 
and 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
eleven 
existing 
dams, 
would 
be 
implemented through 
GDI 
directly, 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
the 
international 
TA 
team 
which may 
have 
to 
be 
expanded 
as 
required. 
In 
order 
for 
GDI 
to 
be 
able 
to 
implement 
this 
program, 
its 
capacity 
would 
have 
to 
be 
built 
up 
drastically 
(foreseen 
under 
the 
project) and 
it 
would 
have 
to 
contract 
out 
most 
of 
the 
work.  Overall implementation 
and 
overview 
would 
require 
at  least 
a 
hydrogeologist, 
a 
dam 
engineerlprocurement  specialist,  a 
social 
scientist, 
and 
an 
accountant/FM 
specialistladministrator. 
The 
three 
latter 
may be 
shared 
with 
the existing Demand 
Management 
Unit. 
An 
independent 
Dam 
Safety 
Panel 
of 
three 
regional 
experts 
would 
be 
available 
on 
a 
contractual 
basis, 
Throughout 
the 
project, 
however, 
GDI 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
dam 
monitoring, 
supervision 
of 
maintenance, 
O&M 
training 
to 
WAS 
(through the 
project), 
provision, 
on 
a 
rental 
basis, 
of 
heavy 
equipment 
for 
maintenance 
of 
access 
roads, 
dams 
and 
desiltation. 
GDI 
would 
also 
be 
responsible 
for 
monitoring 
cost 
recovery 
of 
O&M 
costs 
by 
WUFs 
(see 
below). 
The 
bulk 
of 
the 
O&M 
budget 
for 
dam 
maintenance 
would 
be 
borne 
by 
GDI 
(see 
para. 
viii, 
below). 
While 
FM 
and 
procurement 
would 
initially 
be 
managed 
by 
the 
TS-SBC, 
MAllGDI 
would 
prepare 
the procurement 
documents 
and receive 
training 
in 
these 
fields, 
so 
that 
for 
Phase 
11 
of 
the 
APL, 
these 
responsibilities 
could 
be 
transferred 
fiom 
the TS-SBC 
to 
the 
line 
ministry. 
(v) 
Within 
MAZIGDI, 
through 
consultancy 
services, 
SMTs 
(two 
for 
demand management 
and 
one 
for 
supply 
management), 
would 
be 
established. 
The 
SMTs 
would 
be 
social intermediaries between 
the 
WGDI 
and the 
stakeholder organizations, 
namely 
well-field 
WUAs 
for 
demand management 
(irrigation) 
and 
wadi 
WUFs 
(dam 
management) 
for 
supply 
management 
(see 
below). 
Their 
major 
role would be 
to 
raise 
awareness 
among farmers 
and 
to inform 
them 
of 
technology 
options, costs 
and 
benefits 
of 
modem 
irrigation 
equipment. 
They 
would 
also 
explain 
the 
incentive 
system 
available under the 
project 
and 
enlist 
the farmers' 
commitment 
to 
refrain 
from 
irrigation 
expansion, 
in 
return 
for 
subsidized 
modern 
irrigation 
equipment. 
On 
dams, 
they 
would 
instruct 
communities 
about 
dam 
safety, maintenance 
and 
O&M 
cost recovery. 
Each 
SMT for 
demand 
management 
would 
consist 
of 
three 
local 
staff 
an 
imgatio~groundwater 
engineer, 
an 
agroeconomiclfinancial 
specialist, 
and 
a 
sociologisthocial 
communicator~A 
specialist. 
The latter 
might 
be 
a woman, 
but 
flexibility 
for 
cultural 
sensibilities 
should 
prevail. 
For 
supply 
management, 
the 
SMT 
would 
comprise 
two 
local 
staff, 
one 
sociallinsti~tional~UA 
specialist and one 
dam 
O&M 
engineer. 
Visits 
to 
stakeholders 
should 
always 
take 
place 
in 
a 
team, 
in 
order 
to 
assure 
the consistency 
of 
the 
messages 
conveyed 
by 
the 
SMT. 
Since 
participation 
is 
based 
on 
demand, 
it 
may 
require 
several 
interactions between the 
SMTs 
and farmerslcommunities, 
until 
they 
decide 
for 
or 
against 
participation. 
Once  a 
WUAlWUF 
agrees 
to 
participate and 
is 
established, 
it 
would 
sign 
a 
tripartite 
contract 
with 
MAI 
and 
the TS-SBC 
for 
Demand 
Management; 
and 
LC 
and 
MA1 
for 
Supply 
Management. 
The 
contract 
would 
stipulate, 
among 
other 
conditions, 
on: 
(a) 
Demand 
Management, 
that 
in 
return 
for 
subsidized 
modern irrigation 
technology, 
irrigation 
areas 
would not 
be 
expanded; 
and 
(b) 
on 
Supply 
Management, 
that, 
as 
far 
as 
GOY 
is 
concerned, 
-18- 
Page  23
any 
land 
to 
be 
flooded, 
including 
private 
land, 
would 
be 
a 
local 
contribution 
to 
the project. 
Any 
compensation 
issues 
would 
be settled 
within 
the community. 
A 
Resettlement 
Policy 
Framework 
(RPF) 
has 
been 
prepared 
as 
part 
of 
the 
EL4 
to 
cover 
the 
unlikely 
event 
that 
compensation 
for 
land 
andor 
resettlement 
may 
become 
an 
issue 
(OPIBP 
4.12). 
Functions and 
staffing 
of 
the 
SMTs 
are 
described 
in 
the 
PIM. 
Stakeholder 
Level 
(vi)WUAs: 
Water 
user 
groups 
(WUGs) 
around 
wells 
and 
village-level 
WUAs 
are 
in 
some 
cases 
already existing.  The project, 
through 
the 
SMTs, 
would 
encourage 
the 
formation 
of 
WUGs 
and 
help 
with 
the creation and 
legal registration 
of 
WUAs 
(Water Law 
# 
33 
of 
August 
31, 
2002). 
An 
officially 
registered 
village 
or well-field 
WUA 
is 
a 
prerequisite 
for 
participation 
in 
the 
irrigation 
modernization 
program. 
WAS 
constitute 
official 
stakeholder representations 
to 
whom 
the 
central 
structure 
(NWRA 
Sana'a 
Branch) 
is 
expected 
to 
delegate 
management, 
regulatory and 
enforcement 
responsibilities,  and 
who 
would 
also 
be 
represented 
in 
the 
SBC. 
The 
WAS 
would 
be 
responsible 
for: 
(a) 
self-regulation 
and 
enforcement 
of 
groundwater 
abstraction 
rights; 
and 
(b) 
implementation 
and 
management 
of 
groundwater 
conservation 
schemes. 
This 
NWRAlstakeholder 
partnership 
would 
be 
tested 
in 
the 
project, 
as 
it 
does 
not 
yet 
exist. 
WUAs 
would 
also 
be 
encouraged 
outside the 
targeted 
areas 
for 
irrigation 
modernization. 
(vii) 
WUFs: 
Local 
beneficiaries 
of 
dam 
and 
recharge structure developments 
along 
a 
wadi 
branch 
would 
be 
organized 
into 
village 
or 
multi-village 
WUFs, 
following 
social 
mobilization 
principles 
similar 
to 
those 
for 
the 
demand management 
interventions. 
These 
wadi-based 
WUFs 
would 
be 
formed 
in 
advance 
of 
implementing physical 
infrastructure. 
They 
would 
be 
in 
charge 
of 
maintaining 
the 
dam 
recharge 
capabilities 
(see 
para 
(viii, 
below). 
Overlaps 
and 
mergers 
between 
WUAs 
and 
WUFs 
may 
occur and 
be 
desirable 
in 
areas 
where 
both 
types 
of 
intervention 
are 
present. 
In 
any 
event, 
WUAs 
may 
federate 
to form 
WUFs 
at 
the sub-basin 
level. They 
would 
also 
be 
represented 
as 
water 
sector stakeholders 
on 
the SBC. 
(viii) 
O&M 
of 
Dams: 
Routine 
O&M 
of 
dams 
will 
be two-fold. 
First, 
for 
dam 
structure, 
performance 
and 
safety, 
GDI 
and 
GOY 
will 
be 
primarily 
responsible. 
This 
includes 
dam 
repairs 
and 
maintenance 
of 
access 
roads 
requiring 
heavy 
equipment. 
Second, 
sustainability 
of 
benefits 
from 
recharge 
and 
access 
roads 
will 
be 
the 
responsibility 
of 
downstream 
beneficiaries. 
For 
GDI 
and 
as 
indicated 
above, 
the 
project 
will 
provide 
training, 
capacity 
building, 
initial 
support 
facilities, 
including 
equipment, vehicles 
and 
software, 
to 
carry out 
regular 
dam 
inspections and 
assessments. 
Provision 
is 
also made for  annual 
dam 
safety 
inspections 
by 
a 
panel 
of 
experts, 
in 
accordance 
with 
World 
Bank 
safeguard 
policies. 
WAS 
will 
be 
assisted 
with 
training 
and 
extension 
services, 
including 
leasing 
of 
heavy 
equipment, 
as 
needed, 
for 
annually 
removing 
silt 
deposits. 
Dam 
and 
reservoir 
access 
roads 
not 
requiring 
heavy 
equipment 
will 
also 
be  maintained 
by 
the 
beneficiary 
communities. 
Heavy 
equipment 
for 
dam 
(dredging) 
and 
access 
road 
maintenance 
work would 
be 
either 
leased 
by 
GDI 
and 
sub-let 
to 
WUFs, 
or 
the 
latter 
could 
directly 
hire 
the equipment 
from 
the 
private 
sector. 
Specialized 
maintenance 
work 
on 
dam 
or 
access 
roads 
would 
be 
carried out 
by 
GDI 
or 
private 
contractors. 
GDI 
would 
be responsible 
for 
payment 
and 
would 
collect 
the 
community 
counterpart 
funds 
from 
the 
WUFs. 
GDI 
would, 
initially 
through project 
consultancy 
services, 
provide 
training 
and 
TA 
to 
WUFs 
in 
the concept 
of 
maintenance 
and 
for 
light 
maintenance 
work, 
as 
described 
above.

(ix) 
Stakeholder foralconsultations: 
During 
project 
implementation, 
extensive stakeholder consultations 
(workshops,  focus 
group 
meetings, 
explicit 
representation 
in 
SBC 
eventslmeetings) 
would 
take 
place 
- 
a 
continuation of 
the 
project 
preparation 
process. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
this 
would 
create 
momentum 
and 
trust 
and, 
as 
a  result, 
ownership 
by 
the 
stakeholders. 
Such 
events 
would 
be 
organized 
by 
the TS-SBC, 
but 
could 
also 
be 
initiated 
by 
the 
stakeholders themselves. 
Financial 
Management 
(FM) 
and 
Accounting. 
The 
FM 
arrangements 
are 
detailed 
in 
Annex 
6 
and 
summarized 
below. 
The project 
FM 
responsibility 
will 
be 
centralized at 
the TS-SBC. 
The 
TS-SBC 
will 
be 
solely 
entrusted 
with 
all 
aspects 
of 
project 
FM, 
including: 
processing 
of 
all 
financial 
transactions, 
maintaining 
project’s 
records 
and books 
of 
accounts, 
financial 
and 
progress 
reporting, 
reconciliation 
of 
project’s 
account 
and 
project’s records 
with 
IDA 
records, Special 
Account 
replenishments, 
compilation 
and 
updating 
of 
annual 
budgets 
as 
well 
as 
analysis 
of 
variations between actual 
expenditures 
and the approved 
budgets. 
The 
project 
accounts 
will 
be maintained 
on 
accrual 
basis 
to 
enable 
monitoring 
of 
all 
costs adequately. 
FM 
System: 
Establishment 
of 
adequate 
FM 
system  acceptable 
to 
IDA 
will 
be 
a 
Condition 
of 
Efectiveness. 
The main 
elements 
of 
adequate 
FM 
system 
are: 
(i) 
qualified financial 
officer; 
(ii) 
FM 
procedural 
manual; 
(iii) 
accounting 
records 
and 
books 
of 
accounts; 
(iv) 
appointment 
of 
qualified 
independent 
auditor;  and 
(v) 
set 
up 
of 
computerized  accounting 
and 
reporting 
system  capable 
of 
producing 
Financial 
Monitoring 
Reports 
(FMRs). 
Completion 
of 
the 
first 
four 
components 
in 
a manner 
satisfactory 
to 
IDA 
would 
be sufficient 
to 
meet the 
Condition 
of 
Effectiveness. 
To 
expedite 
the process 
of 
establishment 
of 
adequate 
FM 
system, 
the 
TS-SBC 
will 
benefit 
from 
FM 
experiences 
gained 
through 
previous 
IDA-financed 
projects 
(Le. 
Rural 
Access  Project), 
through 
the 
adaptation 
of 
existing 
FM 
manuals 
to 
the specific 
needs 
of 
this 
project 
by 
the 
project 
financial 
officer. 
Therefore,  the 
appointment 
of 
qualified financial 
officer, 
which 
will 
take 
place 
shortly 
after 
signing 
the 
credit 
agreement 
according 
to 
TORS 
acceptable 
to 
IDA, 
is 
a 
key 
step 
toward 
having 
adequate 
FM 
system. 
The 
computerized 
FM 
system 
will 
be 
based 
on 
local 
FM 
software 
to 
be 
selected 
from 
the several 
off-the 
shelf 
software applications 
available 
on 
the 
local 
market. 
Reporting: The 
TS-SBC 
will 
prepare semi-annual 
project 
FMR 
and 
submit 
them unaudited 
to 
IDA 
within 
45 
days 
from 
semester-end. 
The 
project’s  accounting 
system 
and 
chart 
of 
accounts 
will 
be 
set 
up 
in 
a 
manner that 
facilitate 
automatic 
generation 
of 
the 
FMR, 
as 
well 
as 
project 
annual 
financial 
statements. 
The 
contents 
and 
format 
of 
the 
project 
FMR 
were prepared 
and 
agreed 
upon 
during 
negotiation. 
Copy 
of 
the 
FMR 
exists 
in 
the 
PIM 
and 
project 
files. 
The 
proposed 
project 
includes 
TA 
to 
the 
project 
implementation team 
in 
MAI 
for 
capacity 
building, 
training, 
and 
strengthening 
the 
ministry’s 
FM 
and 
procurement 
systems 
and 
staff, 
so 
that 
MAI 
will 
be 
able 
to 
carry 
out 
FM 
and 
procurement 
functions 
in 
the 
second 
and 
third 
phases 
of 
the 
APL. 
Flow 
of 
Funds: 
For 
IDA 
funds, a 
Special 
Account 
in 
US 
Dollars 
will 
be 
established 
in 
the 
Central 
Bank 
of 
Yemen 
(CBY) 
and 
managed 
solely 
by 
the 
TS-SBC 
(see 
Annex 
6-B). 
Withdrawals 
from 
IDA 
funds 
will 
be 
made 
using 
traditional 
disbursement 
methods, 
including 
direct 
payments, 
payments 
against 
special 
commitments, reimbursements 
and 
replenishments 
to 
the Special 
Account 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
Statement 
of 
Expenditures 
(SOEs) 
and 
full 
documentation, 
as 
required. 
GOY’S 
share 
of 
the 
project 
cost 
will 
flow 
through 
a 
local 
currency 
account 
at 
the 
CBY. 
Also, 
a 
separate 
project 
account 
will 
be 
established 
at 
a 
commercial 
bank 
or 
the 
CACB 
for 
contributions 
received 
from 
project 
beneficiaries 
and 
WUAs 
(Demand 
Management 
component), 
and 
disbursement 
from 
this 
account 
will 
be 
made 
by 
the 
TS-SBC 
to 
support 
project 
costs 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
project’s 
internal control 
procedures. Payments 
to 
contractors 
and 
- 
20 
- 
Page  25
third 
parties 
from 
the 
Special 
Account 
and 
GOY’s 
share 
account 
will 
follow 
standard arrangements 
currently 
applied 
to 
all 
IDA 
(and 
externally) financed projects  (detailed 
in 
Annex 
6). 
These 
procedures 
involve 
the 
MOF, 
MOPD 
and 
CBY. 
Internal control 
procedures are 
stipulated 
in 
the 
FM 
manual. 
Auditing: 
The 
project financial 
statements 
(balance 
sheet, 
special 
accounts, 
and 
cash 
flow 
statements) 
will 
be 
subject 
to 
annual 
audit, 
in 
accordance 
with 
International 
Standards 
on 
Auditing 
and 
TORS 
acceptable 
to 
IDA. 
The 
audit 
will 
cover 
all 
project 
records 
and 
accounts, 
including 
audit 
of 
the 
Special 
Account, 
GOY’s 
share 
local 
account, 
and the beneficiaries’ 
and 
WUA 
contributions 
deposit account, 
Also, 
the 
audit 
will 
cover 
all 
project 
expenditures 
with 
particular attention 
to 
those expenditures made 
under the 
SOE 
procedures. 
The 
audit 
will 
be 
conducted 
by 
a 
qualified 
auditor 
acceptable 
to 
IDA, 
selected 
under 
selection 
procedures 
applicable 
to 
selection 
of 
IDA 
consultants (least cost method). 
Procurement 
The 
TS-SBC 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
procurement 
of 
the 
entire 
project. 
The project 
would 
provide 
training 
and 
TA 
for 
the 
required 
staffing 
of 
the 
line 
ministry 
(MAI), 
so 
that eventually 
it 
will 
be 
capable 
to 
cany 
out 
these 
activities 
autonomously 
(see 
above). 
Details 
on 
Procurement 
and 
FM 
are 
explained 
in 
Annex 
6. 
D. 
Project 
Rationale 
1. 
Project 
alternatives 
considered 
and 
reasons 
for 
rejection: 
Three alternatives were 
considered: 
(i) 
Imvorting 
Water 
from 
Outside 
the 
Sana’a 
Basin. 
This 
alternative 
would 
not 
only 
be 
expensive 
and 
in 
the 
long-term most 
likely 
unaffordable 
(see 
Section 
A-l), 
but 
it 
would 
also 
entail 
high 
risks 
of 
political 
and 
social conflicts,  especially 
for 
transfers 
from 
areas 
where water 
is 
already 
heavily 
used. 
Such 
conflicts 
over water 
have 
occurred 
elsewhere, 
notably 
in 
Tai 
’z 
(Tai’iz 
Water 
Supply 
Project). 
This 
led 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that 
the 
most 
viable 
approach 
in 
the self-contained 
Sana’a 
Basin 
is 
relying 
on 
water available 
within 
the basin, 
by: 
(a) 
improving irrigation 
efficiency,  thereby reducing 
the gap 
between abstraction 
and 
recharge; 
and 
(b) 
accelerating 
recharge 
of 
precipitation 
(Section 
A-1). 
(ii) 
Top-down 
Avvroach to 
Water 
Resource Management. 
Community 
involvement 
in 
water  resource 
management 
is 
difficult 
and 
time 
consuming, 
and 
outcomes 
may differ from 
what 
planners 
predict. 
Hence, 
a 
more top-down 
approach was considered 
for 
the 
proposed project, 
It 
was 
rejected 
due 
to 
findings 
during 
project 
preparation, 
from 
sector work, 
other 
projects 
and 
from 
experiences elsewhere 
in 
Yemen: 
(a) 
in 
Yemen, 
like 
in 
other countries, 
local 
communal institutions 
have 
a 
good 
success 
potential 
for 
groundwater 
management 
because 
of 
vested 
interests 
of 
users 
from 
a 
common 
source; 
(b) 
water 
management 
institutions 
have 
to 
include, 
in 
one 
form or 
another, 
all 
those 
who 
have 
water 
rights 
and, 
therefore,  an 
interest 
in 
water  management 
(water 
rights, 
perceived 
or 
real, 
are 
often 
fiercely 
defended); 
and 
(c) 
a 
‘topdown’ 
centrallofficial 
institution may 
have 
some 
impact 
as 
an 
‘umbrella’ 
or 
framework 
for 
regulation, 
but 
only 
if 
it 
responds 
to 
the 
demands 
of 
broad-based 
stakeholder organizations. 
(iii) 
Business 
as 
Usual. 
A 
preliminary 
socio-economic  analysis 
conducted 
during 
project 
preparation 
compared the economic 
merits 
of 
business 
as 
usual 
(no 
action) 
with 
a 
progradproject 
aiming 
at 
increasing 
recharge 
and 
improving 
water 
use 
efficiency. The 
analysis, based 
on 
current 
rough 
and 
unproven 
assumptions 
of 
an economically 
accessible 
groundwater 
storage 
of 
between 
2 
BCM 
and 
3

Page  26
BCM 
(using 
standard 
discount 
values) 
and 
on 
the 
social 
and 
political 
difficulties 
of 
transferring 
water 
from 
one 
area 
to 
another (example:  Tai'z), 
led 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that: 
(a) 
the 
project 
could 
considerably 
extend the estimated 
life 
of 
the 
aquifers; 
(b) 
such 
an 
extension 
would 
allow 
the 
GOY 
to 
plan 
for  measures 
to 
change 
water-use 
behaviors and 
patterns 
in 
the 
basin; 
and 
(c) 
linear long-term 
projections 
usually 
result 
in 
overly 
pessimistic 
pictures. 
Unpredictable 
long-term 
social 
behavior 
creates 
socio-environmental 
dynamics 
that 
tend 
to 
favor 
survival 
rather 
than 
doomsday scenarios. 
As 
a 
consequence, 
the 
longer 
the 
time 
to 
full 
economic exhaustion 
of 
the 
aquifers, 
the better 
the 
chances 
that 
a 
socially 
acceptable 
solution 
for 
the 
Sana'a 
Basin population may 
be 
found. Hence, 
the 
project 
team 
has 
decided 
to 
proceed 
with 
the proposed 
programi'project. 
Sector Issue 
(vi) 
APL 
vs. 
Conventional 
Sector 
Investment Credit. 
The 
water 
sector, 
particularly 
viable 
water 
resource 
management, 
is 
key 
for 
the 
future 
economic 
development 
of 
Yemen. 
The 
GOY 
and 
IDA 
have 
decided 
(see 
CAS) 
that 
IDA 
would 
provide long-term 
support 
to 
this 
sector. 
The 
SBWM 
Project 
is 
a 
multi-faceted 
integrated 
water resource management 
operation that 
would 
address 
and 
test 
complex 
social 
and 
technical 
issues 
(water 
rights, 
participatory 
water 
managemen~re~latio~enforcement; 
publicflocal 
partnerships, 
novel 
demand management 
and 
recharge technologies) 
requiring 
long-term 
monitoring 
in 
order 
to 
define 
'best practices' 
in 
the 
Yemeni 
context. 
Integrated 
basin 
management 
is 
also a 
first 
for 
Yemen. Hence, 
it 
was 
decided 
at 
the 
PCD 
stage 
that 
an 
APL 
approach 
would 
be 
best 
suited 
for 
this 
long-term 
support 
and 
for 
drawing 
lessons 
that 
may 
be 
applied 
to 
other basins 
in 
Yemen.

Lessons 
learned and 
reflected 
in 
the 
project 
design: 
From 
the 
Taiz Water 
Supply 
and 
Sanitation 
Project 
The small 
Taiz 
Water Supply 
and 
Sanitation 
Pilot 
Project 
has 
a 
water 
resource management component 
that 
addresses 
issues 
of 
stakeholder 
involvement 
in 
resource management 
and water 
conservation. 
The 
implementation 
of 
the 
project 
has 
been 
difficult. 
Project implementation 
progress was 
finally 
up-graded 
to 
”satisfactory”, 
while 
meeting 
Development  Objectives 
was  ”unsatisfactory”. 
The 
project 
has 
been 
completed and 
the 
ICR 
has 
been finalized. 
Useful 
lessons 
for 
this 
project, include: 
(i) 
An 
up-front good 
understa~ding 
of 
the 
water 
resource, 
the 
shape 
of 
the 
aquifers 
and 
the 
relation 
between 
them, 
and 
the 
relationships 
between surface 
and 
groundwater 
resources 
is 
helpful 
for 
identifying 
the 
“hydraulic 
goal” 
of 
the 
project, 
i.e., 
the concept 
of 
sustainability 
of 
an aquifer 
andor 
its 
‘acceptable’ 
rate 
of 
depletion. 
But 
in 
Yemen, 
this 
is 
in 
most 
cases 
not 
well 
known. 
(ii) 
A 
clear 
water 
resource 
management 
strategy 
is 
required 
to 
define 
how 
the 
hydraulic goal 
is 
to 
be 
achieved, 
what the 
role 
of 
each 
actor 
is, 
and 
what 
is 
the 
package 
of 
rules and 
incentives 
which 
are expected 
to 
bring 
about 
changes 
in 
water management 
behavior. 
(iii) 
A 
stakeholder analysis 
should be carried out 
that: 
(a) 
identifies 
rights 
holders, the 
nature 
of 
their 
rights 
and 
their 
interests; 
(b) 
identifies 
other 
users 
and 
their 
rights, 
interests 
and 
relation 
to 
the 
water 
rights 
holders; 
(c) 
analyses 
the 
existing 
organizational 
and 
institutional 
structure, 
including 
the 
rules 
and 
sanctions; 
and 
(d) 
conducts  a 
“socio-political” 
assessment 
of 
the 
dynamics 
and 
the 
scope 
for 
change. 
(iv) 
The 
enabling~amework 
for 
decentralized 
management 
is 
crucial 
for 
the 
success 
of 
a 
project. 
This 
means: 
(a) 
allowing local 
organizations 
to 
handle 
their 
own 
affairs; 
(b) 
recognizing 
and 
respecting 
traditional 
rights 
and 
the 
decisions 
of 
decentralized institutions; 
and 
(c) 
providing 
needed tools, rules, education, 
information, 
technology, incentives, a 
“court 
of 
appeal”. 
From 
the 
Land 
and Water 
Conservation 
Project 
(LWCP) 
The 
principal 
relevant 
lessons 
from 
LWCP 
are, 
first, 
that 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
reap 
substantial water 
savings 
in 
irrigation 
by 
the 
introduction 
of 
piped 
conveyance 
and 
distribution 
systems, 
using 
buried 
PVC 
pipes. 
About 
550 
ha 
of 
these 
systems 
have  been 
installed 
in 
the 
Sana’a 
Basin 
under 
LWCP. 
Localized 
irrigation 
improvements,  such 
as 
drip 
and 
bubbler 
technologies,  have also 
been 
piloted 
under 
LWCP. 
The results 
of 
these 
pilots 
have 
been 
mixed, 
but 
recent analysis 
suggests 
that 
in 
practice 
overall 
irrigation 
efficiency may 
be 
increased 
by 
these 
means 
from 
the present 
35 
percent 
to 
about 
60 
percent. 
A 
second 
lesson 
is 
that farmers 
are 
interested 
in 
taking 
up 
the costs 
of 
these 
improvements, 
but 
generally 
only 
if 
a 
measure 
of 
subsidy 
(under 
LWCP 
about 
30-40 
percent) 
is 
provided. 
The 
economic 
analysis  shows 
positive 
benefits 
when 
water 
is 
valued 
at 
opportunity 
cost (measured 
as 
the 
return 
to 
water 
in 
the highest 
value available 
use), 
but 
most farmers 
do 
not pay 
the 
opportunity 
cost 
for 
water. Subsidies 
are 
therefore 
needed 
- 
as 
an 
interim 
measure, 
combined 
with 
an 
intensive 
awareness 
campaign 
- 
to 
progressively 
persuade farmers 
to 
change 
their 
pumping 
behavior. 
Although 
the 
incentive 
system 
has 
shown 
positive 
results 
in 
reducing 
pumping, 
a 
final 
lesson 
is 
that 
there 
is 
no 
guarantee 
that  water 
saved 
will 
not 
be 
reused 
by 
the 
same 
farmer 
or 
neighboring 
farmers 
to 
expand 
cultivation. 
There was 
no 
enforcement 
to 
stop 
irrigation 
expansion 
under 
the 
LWCP. 
The 
proposed 
project 
would 
require 
contracts 
(to 
be 
enforced 
by 
community 
management 
institutions) 
to 
ban 
irrigation 
expansion 
(see 
C-1 
Demand 
Management; 
C-4 
- 
Institutional 
Arrangements).

Indications 
of 
borrower 
commitment 
and ownership: 
As 
mentioned 
in 
Section 
B 
- 
2 
- 
Main 
Sector 
Issues 
and Government 
Strategy, 
IDA 
has 
been 
working 
with 
GOY 
since the mid-1990s 
to 
reform 
and modernize 
the 
water 
sector. 
This 
resulted 
in 
a 1997 
IDA 
Water 
Strategy, 
the 
gist 
of 
which 
was adopted 
by 
the 
Council 
of 
Ministers 
in 
December  1998 
as 
the 
Yemeni 
Water 
Strategy. 
This 
strategy 
encompasses 
among 
other 
approaches, 
integrated 
water resource 
management. 
At 
the request 
of 
the 
GOY, 
IDA 
started 
preparing 
the 
SBWM 
Project 
in 
1999. 
Further 
indications 
of 
commitment 
and 
ownership include: 
(i) 
Approving 
the Water 
Law 
(although 
the 
Law 
has 
serious  shortcomings), 
and 
declaring  the 
water-scarcest 
areas 
of 
the 
country, the basins 
of 
Sana'a, 
Sa'ada 
and 
Tai'iz, 
under 
Article 
49 
of 
the 
Water 
Law 
as 
'protected 
zones 
(see 
B-3 
above). 
(ii) 
Beginning 
of 
work 
by 
NWRA 
on 
the 
Sana'a 
Basin Master 
Plan. 
(iii) 
Setting 
up 
a 
Supervisory Committee under 
the 
MOPD 
to 
supervise 
project 
preparation. 
(iv) 
Active 
participation 
of 
MAUGDI. 
(v) 
Creation 
of 
SBC 
under  the 
chairmanship 
of 
Mayor 
of 
Sana'a 
City, 
pointing 
the 
direction 
towards water 
management 
through basin 
management agencies country-wide. 
5. 
Value 
added 
of 
Bank 
support 
in 
this 
project: 
The 
IDA'S 
long-standing 
involvement 
in 
the water sector 
in 
Yemen 
puts 
it 
at 
the 
forefront 
for 
the 
Sana'a 
Basin 
water 
management 
reform 
agenda. 
IDA 
is 
by 
far, 
GOY'S 
principal 
partner 
in 
water 
resources 
management 
and 
strategy. 
GOY, 
IDA 
and 
other  donors 
worked 
together 
on 
the 
1997 
Water 
Sector 
Review, 
and 
IDA 
assisted 
in 
the 
development 
and 
discussion 
of 
the 
National 
Water 
Strategy, 
approved 
by 
the Cabinet 
(see 
above). 
Also, 
the 
IDA 
has 
been 
financing 
and 
intensively 
supervising 
the 
Taiz 
Water 
Supply 
Pilot 
Project 
since 
1996, 
which 
was 
testing 
approaches 
to 
integrated water 
resource management 
and 
producing 
lessons that 
will 
be 
of 
value 
for 
implementing the 
SBWM 
progradproject 
(see 
D-3). 
Finally, 
IDA 
has: 
(i) 
worldwide 
experience 
with 
integrated water 
resource management; 
(ii) 
technical 
resources 
that 
can 
bring 
international 
expertise 
to 
bear 
on 
the 
complex 
problems 
of: 
(a) 
groundwater 
management 
under 
severe 
drought  and 
overdraft 
conditions; 
(b) 
institutional 
arrangements that have 
worked 
elsewhere; 
and 
(c) 
water 
legislation 
and 
regulation; 
and 
(iii)the 
respect 
of 
other donors 
in 
Yemen 
(and 
elsewhere) 
to 
take 
the 
lead 
in 
a 
joint 
effort 
to 
help 
GOY 
to 
come 
to 
grips 
with 
groundwater 
management.

Main 
project 
benefits 
are 
to 
(i) 
increase the 
useful 
life 
of 
groundwater 
resources 
in 
the basin through 
net 
water 
savings 
(from 
components 
a, 
b, 
c 
and 
d); 
and 
(ii) 
decrease 
the 
likelihood 
of 
human 
and 
socio-economic 
losses 
due 
to 
dam 
failure 
(from 
component 
b). 
Additional 
benefits, 
although 
not 
specifically 
stated 
in 
the 
project's 
objectives, 
are 
an 
increase 
in 
farmers' revenue 
through improved 
financial 
returns 
of 
water 
in 
irrigation 
(component 
a). 
(i) 
The 
primary 
objectives 
of 
the program, 
of 
which 
the 
proposed 
project 
is 
the 
first 
phase, 
are: 
(a) 
to 
increase the 
efficiency 
of 
agricultural 
water 
use 
within 
the 
Sana'a 
Basin; 
and 
(b) 
accelerating 
aquifer

24 
- 
Page  29
recharge 
to allow for 
a gradual 
shifi 
to 
a 
less 
water-based 
rural 
economy. 
Accordingly, 
the 
project 
will: 
(a) 
improve 
the  knowledge 
of 
the  water 
balance 
and 
usable  groundwater 
storage; 
and 
(b) 
test  a 
combination 
of 
technical, 
financial, 
regulatory and institutional 
instruments 
aimed 
at 
increasing 
the 
availability 
of 
water 
(supply 
management) 
and 
decreasing 
its 
demand (demand 
management). Subsequent 
phases 
of 
the 
program 
will 
be 
based 
on 
the 
findings 
of 
the 
first 
phase, 
allowing 
a 
better understanding 
of 
the 
resource 
and 
of 
the 
measures 
to 
be implemented 
to 
best reduce the 
rate 
of 
aquifer 
depletion. 
A 
strong 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
system 
will 
be 
set 
up 
under 
the project. 
Given 
current knowledge 
of 
the 
hydrogeology, 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
quantify 
by 
how 
much 
the 
project 
would 
extend 
the 
useful 
life 
of 
groundwater 
resources. Indeed,  the  groundwater 
imbalance 
and 
the 
exploitable 
groundwater 
storage 
are 
fraught 
with 
high 
degree 
of 
uncertainties, 
and 
the 
overall 
effect 
of 
project 
interventions 
on 
the 
aquifer 
system 
is 
to 
a 
large 
extent 
unknown. 
A 
more direct 
way 
of 
estimating 
project 
benefits 
was 
used consisting 
of 
aggregating, 
at the 
level 
of 
the 
basin, expected 
Net 
Water 
Savings 
(NWS) 
and 
estimating their 
economic 
value 
according 
to 
their 
expected 
future 
use. 
NWS 
are 
expected 
to 
reach 
8 
MCMJyear 
at 
full 
development 
of 
Phase 
I, 
of 
which 
7 
MCMJyear 
from 
the 
irrigation 
improvement 
component 
and 
1 
MCMJyear 
from 
the groundwater  recharge component. 
The 
public 
awareness 
campaign 
and the 
legal 
and 
institutional 
development  components 
are 
critical 
to 
achieve 
these 
savings 
by 
helping 
contain 
irrigation 
expansion 
and 
by 
encouraging the 
adoption 
of 
improved 
technology 
and 
management 
systems, 
including 
the 
proper 
O&M 
of 
infrastructure. 
Additional 
NWS 
from 
the 
public 
awareness 
campaign and the 
legal 
and 
institutional 
framework were 
not 
quantified, 
They could 
be 
substantial however, 
as 
their 
scope 
is 
not 
limited to 
the 
areas 
covered 
by 
the project's 
physical 
investments, 
but 
includes  the  entire 
Sana'a 
Basin 
and 
concerns 
all 
water 
uses 
(not 
only 
irrigation). 
As 
more 
awareness 
of 
water scarcity 
in 
the 
basin 
takes 
hold 
and 
a 
proper regulatory 
system 
is 
in 
place, 
willingness 
and capacity 
of 
local 
communities 
and 
GOY 
to 
counter 
the 
depletion 
of 
the aquifers 
may 
also 
improve. 
Water 
savings were 
valued according 
to 
their 
expected future 
use 
in 
the 
municipal 
and 
industrial 
(M&I) 
and agricultural 
sectors. 
The 
base 
case 
scenario 
assumes 
that 
allocation 
to 
M&I 
increases 
over 
time. 
The 
economic value 
of 
water 
in 
agriculture 
is 
estimated 
at 
US$0.26J"3 
of 
net 
water 
used 
and 
US$2.6/m3 
in 
M&I. 
Covering 
50 
percent 
of 
the 
irrigated 
area, 
qat 
is 
the 
main 
crop 
grown 
in 
the 
Sana'a 
Basin. 
It 
is 
also 
by 
far 
the most 
profitable 
crop. 
Under 
current 
price 
structure, qat 
is 
financially 
viable 
even 
when 
the 
water table 
is 
as 
deep 
as 
800 
meters, 
whereas vegetable 
and 
hit 
become 
unviable 
at 
about 300-400 
meters. Qat cannot 
be 
excluded 
from 
the project, 
and 
actually 
a 
large 
portion 
of 
the water 
savings 
are 
expected 
from 
improved 
qat 
production. 
(ii) 
Decrease  in 
the 
likelihood 
of 
human 
and 
socioeconomic 
losses 
associated 
with  dam 
failure. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
11 
dams, 
the 
project 
will 
strengthen 
nonstructural 
dam 
safety 
measures 
such 
as 
monitoring 
of 
the 
dam 
safety, 
O&M 
of 
the 
dams 
and 
the development 
of 
emergency 
preparedness 
plans 
(Dam 
Safety requirement, 
OP 
4.37, 
BP 
4.37). 
Benefits 
from 
this 
component 
were 
not 
valued 
as: 
(a) 
no 
quantitative 
estimate 
is 
available 
on 
potential 
property 
damage; 
and 
(b) 
no 
attempt  was 
made 
to 
quantify 
the 
economic  cost 
of 
mortality 
and 
injuries. 
However, 
it 
is 
clear that  the 
dams 
selected 
for 
rehabilitation 
would 
pose serious threats 
to 
downstream populations 
(estimated 
at 
about 
6,000 
people) 
and 
their 
properties, 
if 
they 
were 
not 
rehabilitated. 
(iii) 
Agricultural 
benefits. 
In 
addition 
to 
saving 
water, 
irrigation 
improvement 
has a 
positive impact 
on 
farmer 
revenues, 
as 
crop yields 
and 
produce 
quality 
improve 
and 
labor 
and 
pumping 
costs 
decrease. 
Based 
on 
experiences 
from 
LWCP, 
at 
full 
development, 
yield 
increases 
are 
expected 
to 
range 
from 
2 
to 
4 
percent and 
the 
reduction 
in 
the 
volume 
of 
water 
pumped 
from 
20 
percent 
to 40 
percent, depending 
on 
the type 
of 
irrigation 
improvement 
considered. 
Additional yield 
increases 
from 
the extension 
services 
- 
25

Page  30
were 
not 
quantified, 
nor 
were the 
potential 
improvements 
in 
the 
quality 
of 
agricultural 
products 
valued. 
The 
detailed economic 
analysis 
is

Proposed 
cost 
sharing arrangements 
Irrigation 
improvements: 
Capital 
cost 
sharing 
principles 
for 
irrigation 
improvements 
are 
based 
on 
those 
for 
the 
previous 
LWCP. 
However, they 
have been 
modified 
to 
reflect 
the 
key 
objectives 
of 
the 
project. 
Specifically, 
increased 
levels 
of 
project 
subsidies 
to 
participating 
users 
have 
been 
defined 
to: 
(a) 
accelerate 
participation 
in 
the 
first 
phase, 
thereby 
having 
a 
strong 
demonstration 
effect; 
and 
(b) 
serve 
as 
incentive 
to 
farmers 
to 
refrain 
from 
future 
use 
of 
the 
saved 
water and 
future 
extension 
of 
irrigated 
areas. 
The 
selected 
levels 
of 
beneficiaries contributions 
to 
capital 
costs are 
indicated 
in 
the table 
below. 
All 
O&M 
costs 
would 
be 
bome 
by 
the 
direct 
beneficiaries. 
The 
water 
users' share 
would 
be 
paid 
in 
two 
stages: 
(a) 
a 
down-payment 
of 
YR 
20,000 
would 
be 
made 
prior to 
design, 
to 
ensure 
farmer's 
commitment 
to 
the 
project; 
and 
(b) 
the 
balance 
would 
be 
paid prior to 
installation 
of 
the 
equipment. 
Water 
users 
would 
deposit 
their 
contribution 
in 
a special account at 
the 
Sana'a 
branch 
of 
the 
CACB 
which 
should 
notify 
the 
project and credit 
the project's 
account 
from 
the 
deposit 
as 
quickly 
as 
possible. 
It 
is 
foreseen 
that water 
users 
could 
access 
credit 
from 
CACB 
to 
finance 
their 
share 
of 
the 
investment 
cost. 
The 
project 
would 
support 
this 
effort 
by 
helping 
water 
users 
in 
the  credit 
applications  and 
providing 
the 
bank 
with 
all 
necessary 
information 
regarding 
the  proposed 
activities 
to 
be 
financed. 
However, 
the 
project 
would 
not 
finance 
or 
guarantee 
in 
any way, 
the 
farmer's 
share 
of 
investment. 
Annex 
2 
and 
4 
contain more 
details 
on 
the proposed 
cost 
sharingiprocurement 
arrangements 
for 
the 
demand management 
component. 
Construction and 
rehabilitation 
of 
recharge 
dams: 
Contributions 
from 
beneficiaries 
to 
the 
capital 
costs 
of 
dams are 
not 
foreseen. 
This 
applies 
also 
to 
those 
O&M 
costs 
that  relate 
directly 
to 
dam 
structure 
performance 
and 
safety. 
GDI 
would 
take 
on 
the 
responsibility 
for 
routine 
inspections  and 
safety. 
However, 
local 
beneficiary 
communities 
would 
carry 
out 
or 
arrange 
for: 
(a) 
dry 
season 
sediment 
removal 
from  reservoirs 
for 
maintaining 
recharge benefits, 
and 
(b) 
maintenance 
of 
darn 
and 
reservoir 
access 
roads, 
Based 
on 
preliminary 
estimates, 
farmers 
contributions 
may 
cover 
up 
to 
15 
percent 
of 
(a) 
and 
(b). 
This 
level 
will 
be revised 
based 
on 
a 
community financial 
assessmentslwillingness-to-pay 
survey 
to 
be 
carried out 
by 
SMTs 
during 
the 
initial 
social intermediation. 
Fiscal 
Impact: 
The 
project's 
overall fiscal impact 
will 
be 
negligible. The project 
cost 
of 
US30 
million 
would 
be 
bome 
by 
GOY 
(12 
percent),  the 
IDA 
credit 
(80 
percent) 
and 
the  contributions 
(in 
kind 
or 
financial) 
of 
- 
26 
- 
Page  31
beneficiaries 
(8 
percent). 
Over 
the five-year 
implementation 
period 
of 
the 
project, 
GOY 
will 
have 
to 
provide 
US$3.5 
million 
counterpart 
funds 
or 
an 
average 
of 
about 
US$0.7 
million 
a 
year. 
This 
is 
less 
than 
2 
percent 
of 
the annual budgets 
of 
MA1 
and 
NWRA 
combined 
(the 
two 
implementing 
agencies). 
Since 
about 
US$1.9 
million 
of 
the 
total 
project 
cost 
are 
taxes, 
net 
GOY 
contribution 
will 
only be 
USS1.6 
million 
over the implementation 
period 
of 
the 
project. 
3. 
Technical: 
Water 
Resources 
and 
Hydrogeological 
Assessment 
The aquifer 
system 
in 
the 
Sana'a 
Basin 
is 
complex and 
our knowledge 
is 
limited. 
Thus, 
the analysis 
of 
the 
groundwater 
balance 
focuses 
on 
the 
consumptive 
use 
versus 
active 
replenishment. 
Estimates 
of 
the 
net 
consumptive 
use (after 
deduction 
of 
recharge 
from 
reflow) 
range 
from 
155 
MCM 
to 
190 
MCM. 
Recharge 
from 
precipitation 
is 
estimated 
from 
40 
MCM 
to 
65 
MCM. 
The 
deficit, 
or 
mining 
of 
aquifer 
storage, 
is 
therefore 
between 
90 
MCM 
and 150 
MCM 
per 
year. 
While 
the 
recharge 
effect 
on 
shallow 
aquifers 
in 
some 
areas 
seems 
to 
be significant 
(Thoma, 
Allujima 
and Al-Jeaf 
dams), 
even 
with 
widespread 
agricultural 
real 
water 
saving 
(introduction 
of 
modern 
irrigation 
technologies) 
and 
intensified 
artificial 
wadi 
recharge, 
it 
is 
unlikely 
that 
a 
water 
balance can 
be 
restored 
in 
the 
basin. Hence, the strategy 
is 
to 
reduce the 
speed 
of 
mining 
and 
extend 
the 
useful 
life 
of 
the 
aquifers 
to 
gain time 
for 
GOY 
to 
find 
long-term 
solutions, 
for 
example, 
in 
shifting 
the focus 
of 
the 
basin' 
s 
economy 
to 
less 
water 
intensive activities 
and 
to 
encourage 
out-migration. 
During 
project 
implementation, 
more 
accurate 
figures 
on 
actual 
depletionhecharge rates 
of 
the 
deep 
Tawilah 
aquifer, 
as 
well 
as 
of 
the shallow 
ones, 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
obtained through 
exploration 
and 
monitoring 
wells. 
Furthermore, 
water transfer 
options 
beyond 
those 
studied under 
SAWAS may 
also 
have 
to 
be 
explored, 
notably 
those 
in 
little 
populated 
areas 
like 
the 
groundwater 
resources 
of 
the 
desert 
area 
of 
Ramlat 
Assaba'atain. 
Wastewater 
Rechargemeuse 
The 
option 
of 
recharging 
wastewater 
from 
the 
Sana'a 
urban 
area has 
been considered 
@resent average 
about  7 
MCM 
per 
year), 
but 
was discarded 
because: 
(a) 
the 
effluent 
is 
currently 
used 
by 
about 600 
farmers 
downstream 
from 
the 
treatment 
plant, 
who 
are 
using 
it 
to 
irrigate 
about 
300 
ha 
of 
land 
and 
taking 
it 
away 
from 
them 
may 
create 
unrest; 
(b) 
artificial 
recharge 
requires 
an 
effluent quality 
assurance 
(to 
prevent  aquifer 
pollution) 
that  can 
not 
be 
guaranteed; 
and 
(c) 
artificial 
recharge  technologies 
are 
sophisticated, 
requiring 
well-trained 
staff 
and 
may 
have 
high 
operating 
costs 
(energy). 
Recharging 
naturally 
from 
open ponds 
would 
not 
be 
feasible 
or 
practical 
because 
farmers 
would 
inevitably 
use the 
water 
in 
ponds 
for 
irrigation, 
plus 
evaporation 
rates 
in 
this 
dry 
highland 
climate 
are 
too 
high 
to 
justify 
the 
investment. 
RurallUrban Water 
Transfers 
The 
difficulty 
of 
arranging equitable 
and sustainable 
rural-urban 
transfers 
has 
been 
at the 
heart 
of 
the 
urban 
water 
supply 
problem 
for 
years. 
GOY 
has 
tended 
to 
assert 
national 
ownership 
and 
to 
appropriate 
the 
resource 
by 
drilling 
deeper 
for 
urban 
use 
than 
other 
users, 
but 
this 
has 
contributed 
to 
competitive 
over-pumping 
of 
aquifers. 
Competition 
for 
water 
has become 
so 
intense 
that  communities have 
even 
opposed  test 
drilling 
(Tai'iz 
Water 
Supply 
Pilot 
Project). 
Official 
water 
markets 
are 
not 
allowed. 
Unofficial 
water 
transfers 
exist 
everywhere 
through 
the 
sale 
of 
water 
in 
tanker trucks 
from 
agriculture 
wells 
to 
domestic users (about 
two-thirds 
of 
all 
water 
supplied 
in 
Sana'a 
comes 
from 
private 
sources 
- 
two 
private 
distribution 
networks 
and 
tanker  trucks). 
However, 
an 
open discussion 
of 
rural 
- 
urban 
transfer 
would 
not 
be 
well-received 
by 
the 
farming community 
at 
this 
point. 
This 
has 
been 
clearly 
demonstrated 
during 
stakeholder meetings 
in 
the course 
of 
project 
preparation. 
- 
27 
- 
Page  32
A 
different  approach 
is 
proposed. 
Initially, 
water 
not 
abstracted 
for 
irrigation 
from 
the 
Tawilah 
aquifer 
which 
primarily 
serves 
Sana'a 
City 
and 
adjacent 
suburbia, 
is 
water  saved 
for 
later 
municipal 
use. 
Therefore, 
making 
more 
water  available 
from 
shallow 
depths 
for 
agricultural 
purposes 
is 
a 
win-win 
situation.  Farmers 
save 
on 
pumping 
costs 
and 
urban 
dwellers 
benefit 
from 
a 
longer 
life 
of 
the 
deep, 
largely unpolluted 
aquifer. 
In 
the longer 
run, 
and 
as 
abstraction 
regulations, 
water 
rights 
and 
well 
metering 
take 
hold, 
in 
combination 
with 
improved irrigation 
technologies 
and an 
intense 
awareness campaign, 
it 
may 
be 
possible 
that, 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
year, 
well 
owners 
find 
they 
have 
used 
less 
water 
than 
their 
allowed 
quota. 
This 
may 
create a 
farmer-driven 
market 
to 
sell 
excess 
water 
to 
urban 
areas. 
A 
savvy government 
may 
then 
play 
a 
supportive 
role 
in 
organizing 
and 
regulating rural-urban 
water 
trade. 
4. 
Institutional: 
Water 
Law 
As 
mentioned 
in 
B-3 
above, 
the 
Water 
Law 
had 
been 
approved, 
but 
it 
has 
significant 
flaws. However, 
in 
the 
country's water-scarcest 
areas, 
the 
basins 
of 
Sana'a,  Sa'ada 
and 
Tai'iz, 
these 
flaws 
have been 
mitigated 
by 
Cabinet 
Decrees 
declaring 
the 
areas, 
under 
Article 
49 
of 
the 
Water Law, 
as 
'protected 
zones'. 
Bylaws 
for 
the 
Water 
Law 
in 
general 
and 
for 
the 
'protected 
zones' 
in 
particular 
will 
be drafted shortly 
with 
assistance 
from 
IDA. 
Water 
Use 
Rights 
The 
law 
addresses 
water 
rights, 
but 
may 
in 
the 
short 
run 
encourage 
more 
well-drilling, 
thereby increasing 
water 
rights 
which 
- 
already 
today 
- 
exceeds 
renewable capacity 
by 
100 
percent 
to 
150 
percent. 
The 
'protected 
zones' 
decree 
would 
help 
alleviate  over-pumping 
in 
the 
critical 
areas, 
including 
the 
Sana'a 
Basin 
(Section B-3, 
above). 
Package 
of 
Incentives 
and 
Rules 
To 
change 
water 
management 
behavior, a package 
of 
incentives 
and 
rules 
for 
water 
users 
in 
the 
basin 
is 
proposed. 
Irrigation 
equipment 
would 
be 
provided 
under 
a cost-sharing 
agreement 
(subsidy) 
(see 
C-4 
- 
Institutional 
Arrangements) 
provided 
farmers reduce 
pumping 
from 
the 
deep 
aquifer and do 
not 
expand 
irrigated 
areas. 
Dams 
would 
be 
built 
and 
rehabilitated 
under 
a 
contract 
with 
the 
beneficiaries, 
stipulating 
that 
they 
take 
care 
of 
O&M, 
with 
a cost-sharing agreement 
between 
govemment 
(GDI) 
and 
beneficiaries 
to 
be 
phased 
out over 
the 
project 
period 
(C-4, 
above). 
This 
approach 
is 
consistent 
with 
that 
used 
in 
programs 
worldwide 
for 
changing 
individual 
resource management behavior, 
where 
the 
public 
benefit 
greatly 
exceeds 
the 
private 
benefit, 
and 
where the 
costs 
are 
bome 
largely 
by 
individuals, 
but 
the 
benefits 
are 
felt 
by 
the 
population 
at 
large. 
Typically, 
subsidies 
of 
various 
kinds 
are 
applied 
in 
return 
for 
agreement 
to 
comply 
with 
certain 
rules. 
Experience 
also shows 
that at the 
end 
of 
the subsidized investment 
phase 
such 
programs can 
deteriorate, 
unless there 
is 
a 
continuing 
flow 
of 
benefits 
andor 
unless a 
pattem 
of 
respect 
for 
new 
rules can be 
developed. 
Yemeni 
experience 
with 
this 
approach 
is 
very 
limited, 
and 
outcomes 
are 
difficult to 
predict. 
Therefore, 
close 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
would 
be 
essential. 
4.1 
Executing 
agencies: 
NWRA 
has 
national responsibilities, 
but 
limited 
capacity 
and, 
therefore, 
its 
active 
role 
in 
the 
project 
would 
be 
limited. 
Consequently, 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
NWRA 
Sana'a 
Branch 
is 
proposed. 
With 
strong 
support 
-28- 
Page  33
(capacity 
building, 
training, 
TA) 
from 
the project, 
it 
is 
expected that  the 
NWRA 
Sana’a 
Branch 
will 
become a 
viable 
regulatory 
and 
planning 
agency 
for 
the 
Sana’a 
Basin. (C-4 
- 
Institutional 
Arrangements). 
4.2 
Project 
management: 
See 
above 
and 
also 
C-4 
- 
Institutional 
Arrangement. 
4.3 
Procurement 
issues: 
The 
TS-SBC 
will 
have a 
procurement 
officer 
among 
its 
staff. 
Intensive 
training 
is 
foreseen 
to 
build 
up 
the 
TS-SBC‘s 
procurement capacity 
in 
the 
first 
year. 
A 
procurement 
plan 
for 
the 
first 
year was agreed 
upon 
during 
negotiations. 
A 
full 
procurement 
capacity 
assessment 
would 
be 
carried out 
once  the 
TS-SBC 
is 
fully 
operational. 
More 
detailed procurement

Financial 
management 
issues: 
The 
FM 
arrangements 
to 
be used 
in 
the 
project 
would 
be 
centralized 
at 
the 
TS-SBC 
within 
the 
SBC. 
The 
identified 
risk 
areas 
are 
assessed 
as 
High 
due to: 
(a) 
the 
complexity 
of 
the 
project 
arrangements; 
(b) 
the 
involvement 
of 
several government 
agencies 
and 
local 
WAS 
in 
the 
implementation 
process; 
(c) 
local 
contributions 
from 
beneficiaries  and 
WUAs, 
which 
require 
close 
monitoring 
and 
detailed accounting 
procedures; 
and 
(d) 
the  TS-SBC 
financial 
officer 
and other 
staff 
would 
be 
newly 
recruited 
without 
relevant 
experience 
in 
IDA-financed  project. 
These 
risks 
would 
be 
mitigated 
through: 
(a) 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
fully 
staffed 
TS-SBC, 
with 
a 
qualified financial 
officer, 
would 
allow 
the 
necessary segregation 
of 
duties 
according 
to 
the 
generally 
accepted 
internal 
control 
rules; 
(b) 
expedite 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
FM 
manual through 
adaptation 
of 
the 
FM 
manual 
of 
the 
Rural 
Access 
Project 
to 
the 
specific 
needs 
of 
this 
project 
(time 
and 
cost 
savings); 
(c) 
a 
well-defined 
role 
of 
the 
MOF 
and 
MOPD 
in 
the disbursement 
approval 
stage; 
(d) 
intensive 
reviews 
by 
IDA 
staff,  for 
both 
procurement 
and 
SOEs, 
would 
strengthen 
the 
internal 
control 
and 
minimize 
the inherent 
risks 
associated 
with 
SOEs; 
and 
(e) 
close 
supervision 
by 
IDA’S 
staff.

Environmental: 
5.1 
Summarize the 
steps 
undertaken 
for 
environmental 
assessment 
and 
EMP 
preparation 
(including 
consultation 
and 
disclosure) 
and 
the 
significant 
issues 
and 
their 
treatment 
emerging 
from 
this 
analysis. 
This 
project 
is 
an 
environmental  improvement 
operation. 
It 
has 
been 
classified 
as 
an 
environment 
Category 
‘A’ 
intervention 
because 
of 
the 
proposed  construction 
of 
two 
small 
hill 
dams 
(recharge 
structures) 
that 
exceed 
15 
meters 
of 
height 
(16 
m 
and 
18 
m), 
the 
potential 
social 
issues 
related 
to 
water 
management 
in 
an 
extremely water 
scarce 
environment, 
and 
the 
overall complexity 
of 
the project. 
This 
triggered 
a 
full 
EIA 
(OP 
4.01) 
and 
an 
EMP. 
Environmental 
Category: 
A 
(Full 
Assessment) 
The draft 
EM 
and 
EMP 
have 
been 
prepared 
and distributed 
to 
the 
InfoShop 
on 
March 
7, 
2003. 
The 
document 
was 
also 
disclosed 
to 
the 
public 
in 
Yemen 
on 
March 
10,2003 
through 
the 
World 
Bank 
office 
in 
Sana’a, 
the 
Water 
and 
Environment 
Center 
(WEC) 
of 
the 
Sana’a 
University, 
the 
Public Library, 
the 
Environmental Protection 
Authority 
(EPA), 
as 
well 
as 
the 
Office 
of 
the 
Project 
Preparation 
Team. 
Both, 
the 
full 
EIA 
and 
the 
Executive 
Summary 
with 
the 
EMP 
are 
also 
available 
in 
the 
Project 
File. 
The 
EL4 
was 
carried 
out 
on 
behalf 
of 
GOY, 
under 
the leadership 
of 
an 
intemational 
environmental 
specialist, 
with 
four 
local 
experts 
in 
pest 
management, 
cultural 
heritage, 
biodiversity, and 
public 
health. 
The 
EL4 
drew 
data 
from 
ongoing project preparation 
studies, 
satellite 
imagery, 
social 
assessment, 
rapid 
rural 
appraisal, 
wells 
and 
dams 
inventories 
and 
several 
field 
visits. 
It 
also 
assessed 
a 
number 
of 
institutions 
at 
both 
national 
and 
local 
levels, 
governmental 
and 
non-governmental, 
which would 
or 
might 
be 
involved 
in 
the 
project 
and 
its 
social and environmental 
complexity. The 
main 
counterparts 
for 
this 
-29- 
Page  34
project 
would 
be 
the 
NWRA 
Sana‘a 
Branch, 
WGDI 
and the 
DPP, 
which 
would 
play 
a 
key role 
in 
implementing 
the 
PMP. 
The 
MOPHP would 
closely 
monitor 
the 
incidence 
of 
schistosomiasis 
in 
the 
project 
area. 
The 
EIA 
evaluated 
the 
Bank’s 
Environmental 
and 
Social 
Safeguard 
Policies 
for 
possible application, 
Particularly reviewed 
were 
“Natural  Habitat”  (OPIBP 
4.04);  “Pest 
Management” 
(OP 
4.09); 
“Cultural 
Property” 
(OPN 
1 
1.03); 
“Involuntary 
Resettlement” 
which 
includes 
Involuntary 
Land 
Acquisition 
(OPIBP 
4.12); 
and 
“Safety 
of 
Dams”  (OPIBP 
4.37). 
Except 
for 
Dam 
Safety, 
Involuntary 
Resettlement 
(for 
land 
acquisition) 
and 
Pest 
Management, 
the 
Bank’s 
Safeguard 
Policies 
are 
not 
triggered. 
Related 
issues 
and 
mitigation 
measures 
are 
described 
below. 
Dam 
Safetv 
(i) 
The 
rehabilitation 
of 
existing 
dams 
proposed 
for 
this 
project 
is 
a 
mitigation 
measure 
to 
address 
safety 
hazards. 
Out 
of 
44 
dams 
in 
the 
basin, 
24 
were 
assessed 
as 
needing 
rehabilitation. 
Out 
of 
these, 
11 
dams 
throughout the basin 
are 
considered 
priorities 
and 
included 
in 
the proposed project, 
as 
they 
may 
pose a serious safety 
risk 
for 
downstream 
populations 
and 
require 
immediate 
work. 
(ii) 
Out 
of 
the 
nine 
sites 
for 
new 
dams 
identified, 
the 
project 
team 
selected 
five 
recharge 
structures, 
two 
of 
which 
exceed 
15 meters, 
two 
smaller 
dams 
and 
a cascading series 
of 
check 
structures. 
In 
addition, 
other 
smaller 
surface 
retention, 
or 
sub-surface 
structures 
will 
be 
tested 
during 
project 
implementation. 
The 
selection 
of 
the 
dam 
sites was  based 
on 
a 
rapid 
social 
assessment 
which 
determined 
the 
level 
of 
community 
demand, 
or 
willingness 
to 
participate. 
Observing 
the 
demand-responsiveness 
principle, 
only 
sites 
with 
the highest favorable 
rating 
were 
selected. 
A 
dam 
safety 
expert 
visited 
all 
sites 
and 
preliminarily 
concluded that the 
sites 
and 
foreseen 
work 
for 
the 
selected 
dams, 
both 
rehabilitation 
and 
new, 
would 
not 
pose 
any safety 
risk. 
However, he 
will 
also 
review 
feasibility 
studies, 
final 
designs 
and 
bidding 
documents. 
In 
addition, nonstructural 
safety 
measures 
were 
recommended 
and 
would 
be 
taken 
by 
the design 
engineers, 
such 
as 
installation 
of 
instrumentation 
and 
monitoring 
devices, 
O&M 
plans, 
including 
emergency  preparedness 
plans, 
and 
establishment 
of 
an 
independent 
panel 
of 
experts 
who 
would 
supervise 
final 
designs 
and 
safety 
measures. 
To 
avoid 
any 
landscape 
disfiguration,  construction 
contract  documents 
would 
stipulate that 
stone and 
gravel 
would 
only 
be 
provided 
by 
official 
quarries. 
The  Summary 
of 
the 
Dam 
Safety 
Report 
is 
part 
of 
the 
EM. 
Together 
with 
the 
full 
Dam 
Safety Report, 
it 
is 
also 
available 
in 
the 
Project File. 
Land 
Acauisition 
No 
involuntary 
population 
resettlement 
would 
be required 
in 
the 
identified 
dam 
sites. 
In 
the 
majority 
of 
cases, 
the 
land 
to 
be 
flooded 
would 
be 
“common  land”, 
not 
used 
for 
productive 
purposes 
and 
owned 
by 
the community. 
Nevertheless, there 
may 
be 
cases 
when individually-owned 
land may 
be 
inundated, 
in 
which 
case 
GDI’s 
pragmatic, 
demand-based 
approach 
for 
involuntary 
‘land 
acquisition’ 
would 
apply. 
GDI 
traditionally 
responds 
to 
a 
community 
demand 
for 
a 
dam 
by 
carrying 
out 
a survey 
of 
the 
area, 
identifying 
the 
land 
that 
would 
be 
flooded. 
The 
communities 
and 
responsible 
LCs 
internally 
discuss 
and 
agree 
on 
a compensation 
(in 
most 
cases 
a substitute 
land 
area) 
and 
sign 
a 
tripartite 
contract (community, 
LC, 
MAI-GDI) 
that 
no 
compensation 
from 
GOY 
is 
required. 
The 
land 
contribution 
constitutes 
the 
community’s 
share 
towards 
the 
construction 
of 
the 
dam 
and 
the 
benefits 
derived 
from 
it. 
If 
no 
agreement 
is 
reached, 
no 
darn 
is 
built. 
This 
policy 
has 
been 
in 
force 
since 
1994 and 
has 
so 
far 
never 
led to 
a 
dispute 
(Letter 
from 
MAI 
on 
Land 
Acquisition 
PoZicy 
- 
March 
11, 
2002 
- 
Project 
File). 
However, 
to 
cover 
the 
possibility 
that 
some 
involuntary 
expropriation 
might 
be 
necessary, 
the 
policy 
on 
Involuntary 
Resettlement 
has 
been declared 
applicable 
and 
actions 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
are 
presented 
in 
Section 
7.2 
- 
30 
- 
Page  35
below. 
Pest 
Management 
Pesticides 
and fertilizers 
are 
used 
freely 
and increasingly. 
Even 
though 
there 
is 
no 
direct linkage 
between 
the 
rising 
use 
and 
the 
proposed 
project, 
the 
EL4 
proposes a 
model 
PMP 
to 
be applied 
in 
the 
project 
areas 
for 
grapes, 
the 
second 
most  prevalent 
crop 
(first 
is 
qat). 
During 
the 
first 
half 
year 
of 
project 
implementation, 
a 
similar 
PMP would 
also 
be 
designed 
for 
qat. 
These 
two 
plans 
would 
cover 
about 
70 
percent 
of 
all 
crops planted 
in 
the basin. 
Other 
plans, 
notably 
for 
vegetables, 
would 
also 
be 
designed. 
These 
plans  are 
at 
once  a 
mitigation 
measure 
against 
harm 
that 
may 
occur 
from 
excessive use 
of 
chemicals, a 
protection 
of 
public 
health 
and 
a 
learning 
instrument 
for 
DPP 
within 
MAI, 
which 
would 
be 
in 
charge 
of 
implementing 
it, 
DPP 
would 
gain 
experience 
with 
alternative 
means 
to 
combat 
plant 
pests. 
If 
successful, 
these 
models 
could 
be 
replicated 
for 
other 
areas 
in 
the 
basin and 
the 
country. 
The 
sample 
PMP 
for 
grapes 
is 
part 
of 
the 
EIA 
and 
will 
also 
be 
included 
in 
the 
PIM 
and 
in 
the 
Project File. 
Other 
Potential 
Risks 
(i) 
Public 
health: 
Mitigation 
of 
any 
potential 
public 
health 
risks 
related 
to 
the 
project 
will 
be carried 
out 
by 
the 
MOPHP 
as 
part 
of 
its 
Bilharzia control 
program. 
Regular 
inspections 
of 
water bodies close 
to 
human  habitations 
will 
take 
place 
to 
detect 
and 
identify 
the  breeding 
of 
vectors, 
such 
as 
schistosomiasisbilharzia 
which 
is 
prevalent 
in 
the 
Sana'a 
Basin. 
Any 
aquatic 
snail 
colonies 
found 
will 
be 
eradicated 
through 
controlled 
spraying 
of 
molluscicides. 
Bilharzia 
statistics 
will 
be 
monitored 
with 
close 
attention 
to 
the 
project intervention 
sub-basins 
for 
any 
unusual 
pattern. 
Monitoring 
will 
be 
on 
a 
bi-annual 
basis 
as 
part 
of 
the 
ongoing 
effort 
by 
the 
existing clinics 
and health 
facilities 
in 
the 
project 
area. 
A 
public 
health 
bilharzia 
specialist 
will 
be 
available 
as 
a consultant, 
as 
part 
of 
the 
environmental 
resource 
team 
in 
the 
TS-SBC, 
in 
charge 
of 
developing 
and 
overseeing 
both 
health 
education 
and 
control 
measures. 
(ii) 
Shallow 
aauifer  water 
auality: 
A 
survey 
of 
water 
quality 
carried out 
in 
199511996 
by 
SAWAS 
sampled 
water 
in 
77 
hand-dug 
wells 
between 
20 
to 
100 
meters 
deep 
and 248 
boreholes 
between 
100 
and 
400 
meters 
deep 
in 
the 
Sana'a 
Basin. 
Tests 
indicate 
that generally the water 
quality 
is 
suitable 
for 
irrigation. 
As 
would 
be 
expected, 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
water 
in 
the 
shallow 
wells 
was 
poorer 
than 
the 
deeper 
boreholes. 
Biological 
testing 
and 
tests 
for 
pesticides 
residuals 
were 
not 
carried 
out, 
however 
in 
a 
number 
of 
boreholes 
and, 
in 
particular, 
in 
shallow 
wells 
the 
levels 
of 
Chlorides 
(CI), 
Sulfates 
(S04) 
and 
Nitrogen 
Trioxides 
(N03) 
exceed 
the 
WHO 
standards 
for 
drinking 
water. (Recommended 
limits for 
C1 
are 250mgl1, 
for 
SO4 
are 250mg/1 
-and 
for 
NO3 
SOmgll). 
One-third 
of 
shallow 
wells 
exceeded the 
limits 
for 
Chlorides, whereas 
all 
of 
the 
boreholes 
were 
below 
the 
limit. 
Additional 
water 
quality 
tests 
of 
samples 
of 
shallow 
wells 
in 
the 
project 
area 
were 
carried 
out 
during 
the 
project 
preparation. 
The 
presence 
of 
low 
levels 
of 
coliform 
bacteria 
found 
in 
the 
samples 
(9 
- 
16 
per 
100 
ml) 
indicates 
a 
degree 
of 
pollution 
that 
is 
not 
unusual 
in 
open 
wells 
in 
an agricultural 
area, 
where 
pollution 
is 
common 
from 
surface 
sources 
of 
animal and 
human 
wastes. 
Although, 
the 
quality 
of 
water 
for 
drinking 
is 
questionable 
without 
disinfection, 
it 
is 
highly 
improbable that 
any 
transfer 
of 
biological 
pollution 
to 
the 
lower 
aquifer 
could 
take place. 
This 
is 
confirmed 
by 
recent 
isotope 
tracing 
that 
indicates 
that 
the 
recharge 
rate 
of 
the 
lower 
fossil 
aquifer 
takes 
several 
decades 
during 
which 
pathogens 
could 
not 
survive. 
(iii 
Wastewater 
and 
sludge: 
As 
pointed 
out under 
A-1 
above, 
the 
intermittently 
treated 
effluent 
of 
the 
Sana'a 
WWTP 
poses 
a serious 
health 
and 
aquifer 
pollution 
risk. 
It 
is 
inconceivable that 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
the  proposed 
project 
would 
be 
conserving  water 
through 
modem 
irrigation 
and  aquifer 
-31 
- 
Page  36
recharge, 
while 
the 
WWTP 
risks 
to 
pollute 
the groundwater  stock. 
Thus, 
the improvement 
of 
the 
WWTP 
must 
be 
a 
priority 
in 
order 
for 
the proposed 
project 
to 
go 
ahead. 
It 
was agreed 
with 
GOY 
that 
improvements 
would 
be 
made 
both 
in 
the 
treatment 
of 
WW, 
so 
that 
it 
may 
be 
reused for 
restricted 
irrigation 
without pollution 
and health 
risk, 
and 
in 
sludge, 
so 
that 
dried 
sludge 
may 
be 
reused 
as 
soil 
conditioner 
without 
the 
hazard 
of 
surviving 
pathogens. 
GOY 
will 
finance 
the 
final 
engineering design 
study 
and 
has secured 
funding 
from 
the 
Arab 
Fund 
for 
the necessary 
improvement 
works 
of 
the 
WWTP. 
The 
TORS 
for 
the 
final 
engineering 
study 
of 
the 
WWTP 
improvement 
were 
approved 
by 
IDA 
and 
agreements 
were 
reached 
during 
negotiations 
that the 
following 
effluent 
and 
sludge 
quality 
standards 
will 
be 
met: 
(i) 
Microbiological 
quality 
standards 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
World 
Bank's 
Pollution 
Prevention 
and 
Abatement 
Handbook, 
namely 
for 
restricted 
and 
unrestricted 
irrigation: 
- 
zero 
(0) 
- 
less 
than 
one 
viable intestinal 
nematode 
egg 
per 
liter 
(on 
an 
arithmetic 
means 
basis) 
- 
i.e., 
for 
restricted and 
unrestricted 
irrigation; 
and 
less 
than 
four 
hundred 
(400) 
faecal 
coliform 
bacteria 
per 
hundred 
(100) 
milliliters 
(on 
a 
geometric 
means 
basis) 
for 
restricted 
and 
unrestricted irrigation. 
Unrestricted 
irrigation 
refers 
to 
irrigation 
of 
trees, 
fodder and 
industrial 
crops, 
fruit 
trees 
and 
pasture; 
and 
restricted 
irrigation 
refers 
to 
irrigation 
of 
edible 
crops, 
sports 
fields 
and 
public 
parks. 
(ii) 
The 
chemical 
parameters 
to 
be 
met 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
World 
Bank's 
Pollution 
Prevention 
and 
Abatement  Guidelines 
for 
"Limits 
for 
Processed Wastewater,

test  a 
number 
of 
supply 
and

How 
have 
stakeholders been 
consulted 
at 
the 
stage 
of 
(a) 
environmental 
screening 
and 
(b) 
draft 
EA 
report 
on 
the environmental impacts and proposed environment 
management 
plan? 
Describe 
mechanisms 
of 
consultation 
that 
were used 
and 
which 
groups 
were 
consulted? 
In 
accordance 
with 
the  Bank's 
public 
consultation 
and  disclosure 
policy, 
as 
set 
out 
in 
BP 
17.50, 
stakeholders 
and 
other interested 
parties were 
given 
the 
opportunity 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
project 
design 
process. 
Two 
one-day 'scoping'  workshops 
were 
held, 
one 
early 
on 
during 
project 
preparation 
to 
launch 
a 
process 
of 
public 
consultation 
and 
public 
disclo$ure, the second 
in 
November 
2002. 
During 
the early 
stages 
of 
project 
preparation, 
five 
stakeholder 
meetings 
hosted 
by 
NWRA 
were also 
held 
in 
the 
affected 
areas 
. 
They 
were 
well 
attended 
by 
representatives 
of 
the 
communities 
in 
these 
areas. 
Under 
the auspices 
of 
the 
TS-SBCMWRA 
Sana' 
a Branch, 
this 
practice of 
public 
consultationldisclosure 
would 
continue throughout 
the 
project implementation 
period. 
LCs 
would 
serve 
as 
points 
of 
contact 
in 
the 
field,  where the 
public may 
refer 
to 
for 
information, 
or 
where 
it 
could 
lodge 
grievances 
and 
concerns. 
5.5 
What 
mechanisms have been established 
to 
monitor 
and 
evaluate the 
impact 
of 
the 
project 
on 
the 
environment? 
Do 
the 
indicators 
reflect 
the objectives 
and 
results 
of 
the 
EMP? 
An 
EMP 
has 
been 
prepared 
as 
described above and in 
Annex 
2. 
Key 
monitoring 
indicators 
are 
reflected 
in 
Annex 
1. 
6. 
Social: 
6.1 
Summarize 
key 
social 
issues 
relevant 
to 
the 
project 
objectives, 
and 
specify 
the 
project's social 
development outcomes. 
It 
is 
not 
uncommon 
that 
social 
conflicts 
arise 
over 
water. 
Although 
conflicts 
are 
not 
anticipated 
during 
project 
implementation, 
and 
all 
possible 
preventive 
and 
mitigations 
measures 
would 
be 
taken 
(ie., 
full 
participation 
by 
the communities, 
responding 
to 
demand), 
tribal 
animosities 
can 
not be 
entirely 
ruled 
out. 
For 
this, 
plus 
the 
environmental 
reasons 
mentioned 
above, 
the 
project 
has 
been 
rated 
as 
a 
Category 
"A 
operation 
(E-5, 
above). 
Non-expansion 
of 
irrigation 
may 
also 
be 
a 
delicate 
condition 
for 
farmers 
to 
follow, 
especially 
since 
many 
of 
them 
are 
poor 
and 
see 
water 
as 
a 
revenue-eaming 
resource. 
This 
is 
exacerbated 
by 
the 
lack 
of 
full 
understanding 
of 
the 
long-term 
impact 
of 
over-pumping 
or 
aquifer 
depletion. Changing 
mind-sets 
would 
be 
slow. 
But 
measures 
to 
accelerate 
this 
process 
and 
to 
mitigate 
the 
negative 
impact 
that 
a 
limitation 
on 
irrigation 
expansion 
may 
have 
are 
foreseen 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
incentive 
package 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
program 
for 
improved 
irrigation 
methodologies 
(C-1 
(a) 
and 
C-4, 
above), 
the 
rehabilitation 
and 
construction 
of 
up-stream 
dams, 
and 
through the 
PAC 
program 
(C-4, 
above). 
6.2 
Participatory 
Approach: 
How 
are 
key 
stakeholders 
participating 
in 
the 
project? 
The project 
would 
follow 
a demand-responsive approach. 
SMTs 
are 
foreseen 
to 
intermediate between the 
public 
sector 
agencies 
and 
the 
local 
communities 
(see 
Section 
C-4). 
6.3 
How 
does 
the 
project 
involve 
consultations 
or 
collaboration 
with 
NGOs 
or 
other 
civil 
society 
organizations? 
Several 
levels 
of 
consultations  have 
taken place 
during 
project 
preparation 
and 
will 
continue 
during 
project 
implementation. 
(i) 
Environmental 
and 
social 
consultations:  Several 
workshops  and 
stakeholder meetings 
have taken 
place 
in 
the course 
of 
preparation, 
during 
which 
stakeholder groups 
from 
government 
officials 
to 
NGOs 
and 
other 
civil 
society 
representatives 
to 
water 
users 
and 
farmers 
were 
informed 
and consulted

(see 
Section 
C-4). 
6.5 
How 
will 
the project 
monitor 
performance 
in 
terms 
of 
social 
development outcomes? 
The 
TS-SBC 
would 
have a special 
staff 
to 
monitor 
the 
EMP 
(see 
Section 
C-4, 
above), 
the 
Mitigation 
Plan, 
as 
well 
as 
social 
and 
environment-related 
project implementation 
progress, 
and 
to 
collect 
and 
complete baseline information. 
Since the 
latter 
is 
only 
scantily available at 
this 
stage, 
it 
would 
be 
built 
up 
during 
project 
implementation 
for 
the 
long-term benefit 
of 
Sana’a 
Basin 
management 
and, 
especially, 
for 
the 
subsequent phases 
of 
the 
APL.

Safeguard 
Policies:

The 
Borrower 
has 
prepared 
a Resettlement 
Policy 
Framework 
(RPF) 
acceptable 
to 
IDA 
and 
disclosed 
locally 
and 
through the 
Infoshop. 
The 
RPF 
is 
presented 
as 
Annex 
1 
1. 
When 
a 
dam 
site 
is 
identified, 
the 
Borrower 
submits 
to 
IDA 
a 
Land 
Acquisition 
Plan 
identifying 
the  site 
and 
its 
key 
characteristics, 
including 
ownership,  evidence 
of 
consultations  and 
informed-community 
agreement, 
and 
expected 
adverse 
socio-economic impacts, 
if 
any. 
IDA 
advises 
the 
Borrower 
whether 
a Resettlement 
Action 
Plan 
(RAP) 
is 
required 
for 
that 
site, 
and 
whether 
further action 
must 
be 
taken 
to 
ensure 
and 
demonstrate 
full 
community 
consensus, 
or 
else, 
whether 
dam 
site 
approval 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
RAP.

Sustainability 
and 
Risks 
1. 
Sustainability: 
M 
M 
The 
Drincival 
issues 
of 
physical 
sustainabilitv 
are: 
(a) 
the 
mining 
of 
the 
Tawilah 
sandstone, 
which 
has 
to 
be brought 
within 
an 
economically 
rational framework 
by 
dedicating 
the 
aquifer 
to 
the 
highest 
value 
uses 
(municipal 
use); 
and 
(b) 
the 
mechanisms 
for 
sustainable management 
of 
other 
water 
sources, 
including 
the 
alluvial 
and 
volcanic 
aquifers,

(agricultural 
use). 
Careful

on 
special 
study 
and 
on 
experience 
from 
LWCP 
- 
need 
to 
be 
adjusted 
as 
required 
during 
implementation. 
The 
key 
assumptions 
leading 
to 
institutional 
sustainabilitv  include: 
(a) 
the 
likelihood 
of 
rising 
returns 
through 
water 
use 
efficiency 
and 
an 
extended 
water 
availability; 
(b) 
the 
viability 
of 
the approach 
of 
"ownership 
by 
stakeholders" 
of 
the 
program's  water resource management 
strategy; 
and 
(c) 
the 
success 
of 
arrangements 
for 
basin-wide 
planning 
and 
management.

first 
phase 
of 
this 
APL 
is 
testing 
different 
technical 
and 
social 
options, 
taking 
a 
calculated 
risk 
is 
justified. 
If 
this 
first 
phase 
is 
successfid, 
not 
only 
will 
it 
set 
a 
positive trend 
for 
the 
subsequent 
phases, 
but 
it 
may 
also 
serve 
as 
a 
model 
for 
dealing 
with 
similar 
situations 
in 
other 
water 
basins 
in 
Yemen, 
and 
perhaps elsewhere 
in 
the 
region. 
In 
any 
case, 
implementation 
of 
this 
first 
phase 
is 
expected 
to 
yield 
substantial 
new 
knowledge 
of 
the 
basin's 
hydraulic 
strata 
and 
about management 
tools 
to 
increase the 
efficient 
use 
of 
the 
scarce 
resource.

Possible 
Controversial 
Aspects: 
Delegation 
of 
water management remulatow and enforcement 
responsibilities 
to 
local 
institutions: 
NWRA 
may 
be 
reluctant 
to 
delegate 
regulatory 
and enforcement 
responsibilities 
to 
stakeholder 
organizations,  such 
as 
WAS, 
WUFs, 
or 
LCs. 
The project team 
believes that 
self-management, 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
a clear 
regulatory 
system 
(bylaws) 
by 
local 
communities, 
may 
be 
the most 
promising 
solution 
to 
come 
to 
grips 
with 
the current 
indiscriminate exploitation 
of 
the 
basin's 
water 
resources. 
Mitigating 
measures 
are: 
(a) 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
NWRA 
Sana'a 
Branch 
which 
will 
be 
in 
charge 
of 
regulating 
the 
Sana'a 
Basin 
and 
which 
will 
receive 
TA 
through 
the project; 
and 
(b) 
the 
introduction 
of 
bylaws 
that 
would 
foster 
delegation 
of 
these 
responsibilities (drafting 
of 
bylaws 
supported 
by 
TA). 
Nevertheless,  the  process 
will 
be 
slow 
and 
an 
endeavor 
for 
learning 
by 
experience. 
The 
Droiect 
mav 
be 
construed 
as 
assisting qat 
productiodexpansion: 
Qat 
consumption 
is 
indeed 
socio-economically controversial 
(see 
A-1, 
above). 
But 
the 
project 
does 
not 
assist 
or 
promote 
qat 
plantation. 
It 
merely 
helps 
reduce 
water  consumption 
of 
existing 
qat 
plantations 
(constituting 
nearly 
50 
percent 
of 
all 
irrigated 
areas 
in 
the basin) 
by 
introducing 
modem 
irrigation 
systems. 
It 
is 
recognized that the 
use 
and reduction 
of 
qat 
use 
is 
beyond the 
scope 
of 
this 
project 
and 
is 
being 
pursued 
through 
a 
long-term 
dialogue between 
IDA 
and 
GOY. 
Mitigating 
measures 
include: 
(a) 
the 
'benefits 
and 
rules' 
scenario 
of 
limiting 
irrigation 
expansion, 
described 
above; 
and 
(b) 
the 
ongoing

REPUBLIC 
OF 
YEMEN: 
Sana’a 
Basin Water Management Project 
SBWM 
project 
activities 
would 
be carried out 
in 
four 
representative sub-basin 
zones: 
in 
the

Western Area 
(southern 
Hamdan 
and 
Bani 
Matar 
districts); 
South Eastem 
Area (Bani 
Bahloul,

part 
of 
Sanhan 
districts); 
Eastern 
Area (Bani 
Hushaish,

part 
of 
Khawlen 
districts); 
and 
North 
Eastern 
Area 
(Nihm, 
and 
part 
of 
Arhab 
districts) 
- 
see 
map 
for 
details. 
These 
areas 
were 
selected 
on 
the basis 
of: 
(a) 
representativeness 
of 
the 
sub-basins; 
(b) 
high 
chance 
of 
success 
in 
meeting project 
goals; 
and 
(c) 
favorable  environmental 
impact 
on 
the 
selected 
sub-basins, 
i.e.: 
- 
positive impact 
on 
the 
potential 
recharge; 
- 
scope 
for 
supply 
structures 
(dams) 
development 
and 
improvement; 
- 
scope 
for 
irrigation 
improvement and 
reduction 
in 
groundwater 
abstraction; and 
- 
favorable 
socio-economic 
aspects, 
communities’ 
willingness 
to 
participate. 
Project 
execution 
is 
planned 
to 
occur over 
a 
five-year 
project 
period.

ManaPement 
and 
IrriPation 
Imnrovement 
This 
first 
component 
seeks 
to 
achieve 
water 
savings 
and 
conservation 
through 
interventions 
aimed 
primarily 
at 
increasing 
the 
efficiency 
of 
water 
use 
from 
irrigation 
systems 
in 
the 
Sana’a 
Basin. 
These 
are 
viewed 
as 
pilot 
interventions 
with 
a 
view 
to 
expansion 
in 
subsequent 
program 
phases. 
All 
of 
these 
interventions 
are 
planned 
to 
occur 
within 
the 
selected 
Phase 
I 
project 
area, 
which 
comprises 
all 
or 
part 
of 
10 
out 
of 
the 
22 
sub-basins 
of 
the 
Sana’a 
Basin. 
More 
precisely, 
the 
target 
irrigation 
improvement 
areas 
fall 
within 
8 
defined 
sub-catchments 
which 
have 
a 
total 
area 
of 
about 
127,300 
ha 
and 
a 
total 
irrigated 
area 
of 
about 
12,500 
ha; 
these 
areas 
are 
about 
40% 
and 
53% 
respectively 
of 
the 
corresponding 
total 
Sana’a 
Basin 
areas. 
The 
actual 
overall 
target 
irrigation 
improvement 
area 
is 
about 
4,000 
ha; 
this 
corresponds 
to 
3 
1 
% 
of 
the 
irrigated 
area 
within 
the 
8 
sub-catchments, 
and 
to 
17% 
of 
the 
irrigated 
area 
within 
the 
Sana’a 
Basin 
as 
a whole. 
The 
planned interventions 
largely 
comprise 
the 
improvement 
of 
delivery 
(conveyance 
and 
distribution) 
systems 
through 
upgrades 
of, 
or 
conversions to, 
piped 
systems, 
and 
the 
introduction 
of 
various 
modern 
on-farm 
pressurized 
irrigation 
technologies 
that 
have 
previously 
been 
proved 
effective 
in 
enhancing 
water 
use 
efficiencies.  The 
selected 
technology 
types 
and 
target 
areas 
for 
each 
of 
these 
have been 
arrived 
at 
on 
the basis 
of 
assessments 
of 
both 
technical 
suitability 
and 
user 
acceptability. 
They 
are 
summarized 
by 
sub-catchment 
in 
the 
table 
below. 
Further 
projected 
physical 
interventions 
include: 
(a) 
wadi 
bank 
protection 
works, 
for 
some 
vulnerable parts 
of 
the 
target 
irrigation 
area; 
(b) 
land levelling 
over 
3 
15 
ha, 
within 
the 
areas 
targeted 
for 
delivery 
system 
upgrades 
or 
conversions 
only; and 
(c) 
introduction 
of 
plastic 
tunneldcovers 
for 
10 
ha 
of 
demonstration 
plots, 
within 
the 
areas 
targeted 
for 
modem 
on-farm 
pressurized 
system 
installations.

Implementation 
of 
this 
component, 
including 
final 
assessment 
and 
selection 
of 
specific 
locations 
for 
each 
intervention 
type 
within 
each 
sub-catchment, 
is 
to 
be carried out 
with 
full 
community 
participation 
and 
agreement. 
Physical 
interventions 
are 
to 
be 
preceded 
by 
initial 
social 
mobilization 
efforts 
at 
village 
and 
farmer 
levels, 
and 
consequent 
establishment 
of 
suitable 
institutional 
arrangements 
for 
community-based 
water 
management, 
including 
WAS. 
They 
would 
then 
be carried 
out 
in 
parallel 
with 
capacity 
building 
and 
training 
programs. 
Users 
would 
thereby 
assume 
responsibilities 
for 
sustainable 
systems 
development, 
management, 
O&M, 
suitably 
supported 
by 
adequate 
extension 
services. 
Capital 
cost 
sharing 
principles 
proposed 
for 
this 
project 
component 
are 
based 
on 
those 
for 
the 
previous 
LWCP 
and 
its 
proposed 
successor, 
the Groundwater and 
Soil 
Conservation 
Project 
(GSCP). 
However, 
they 
have been 
modified 
to 
reflect 
the 
key 
objectives 
of 
the 
SBWMP. 
Specifically, 
increased 
levels 
of 
project 
subsidies 
to 
participating 
water 
users 
would 
serve 
as 
incentives 
to 
farmers 
to 
refrain 
from 
fiture 
use 
of 
the saved 
water 
and 
fiture 
extension 
of 
irrigated 
areas. 
Results 
of 
the special 
study 
carried 
out 
during 
project 
preparation 
are 
available 
in 
the 
project  file. 
The 
selected 
levels 
of 
beneficiary 
contributions 
to 
capital 
costs 
are 
indicated 
in 
the 
sections 
below 
for 
each 
type 
of 
proposed 
project 
intervention. 
It 
is 
intended 
that 
all 
O&M 
costs 
would 
be borne 
by 
the 
direct 
beneficiaries. 
Seven 
sub-components 
of 
this 
first 
project 
component have 
been 
defined. 
They 
are summarized 
below. 
Sub-component 
1 
(a) 
- 
Upgrading 
of 
piped-irrigation deliverv 
systems. 
This 
sub-component 
is 
directed at 
those 
irrigation 
areas 
that 
are 
already 
filly 
or 
partially 
equipped 
with 
GI 
or 
PVC 
pipeline 
conveyance 
and 
distribution 
systems, 
but 
that 
operate 
with 
lower-than-expected 
water 
use 
efficiencies 
due 
to 
the water 
delivery 
systems 
being 
either 
in 
disrepair 
or 
incomplete, 
The 
systems 
would 
be 
upgraded under 
the 
project 
to filly-piped 
closed 
systems 
delivery 
to 
field 
level, 
leading 
to 
estimated 
irrigation efficiency 
increases 
averaging 
about 
15%. 
The 
sub-component includes: 
(a) 
detail 
study, 
design  and 
supervision 
of 
system  improvements; 
(b) 
supply 
and 
installation 
of 
pipes 
and 
accessories; 
and 
(c) 
corresponding incremental 
O&M 
during 
the 
project 
period. 
The 
estimated 
average 
unit 
capital 
cost 
is 
US$8251ha 
and 
the 
target 
area 
is 
1,660 
ha, 
giving 
a 
total 
estimated 
capital 
cost 
of 
- 
44 
- 
Page  49
US$1,369,500. 
Adding 
the 
incremental 
O&M 
allowances 
gives 
an 
overall 
estimated 
baseline 
cost 
of 
US$l74S3,10O. 
The 
proposed 
levels 
of 
contribution 
to 
capital 
costs 
by 
direct 
beneficiary 
water 
users 
in 
this 
case 
are 
40% 
of 
inaterial 
costs 
and 
20 
% 
of 
installation 
costs. 
This  intervention 
type 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
non-controversial, 
relatively 
easy 
to 
implement, 
not 
very 
disruptive 
during 
implementation, 
and 
well 
supported 
by 
farmers. 
It 
is 
projected 
that, 
following initial 
satisfactory set-up 
of 
institutional 
arrangements, 
there 
would 
be quite 
intensive 
implementation activities 
for 
this 
sub-component 
from 
mid-Year 2 
to 
mid-Year 
4 
of 
the 
project 
period, 
with 
a 
subsequent 
tailing 
off 
of 
activities over 
the 
remaining 
period. 
Sub-comDonent 
1 
(b) 
- 
Conversion 
of 
open 
to 
piped-irrigation 
deliverv 
systems. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
this 
sub-component, 
the 
targets are 
irrigation 
systems 
that 
currently 
comprise 
conventional 
open channel 
networks 
and 
hence experience 
large 
water 
losses. 
Delivery 
systems 
would 
here 
be 
totally 
converted 
to 
fidly-piped 
closed 
systems 
down 
to field 
level. 
The 
irrigation 
efficiency 
increases 
that 
would 
result 
from 
this 
intervention 
type 
are 
estimated 
at 
about 
25%. 
Included 
in 
the sub-component 
are: 
(a) 
detailed 
study, 
design 
and 
supervision 
of 
system conversions; 
(b) 
supply 
and installation 
of 
pipes and 
accessories, 
PVC 
in 
some areas 
and 
GI 
in 
other 
areas; 
and 
(c) 
corresponding incremental 
O&M 
during 
the 
project 
period. 
Buried 
PVC 
pipelines 
are 
preferred and 
are 
to 
be 
used 
wherever  possible, 
but 
surface-laid 
GI 
pipelines 
are 
often 
needed 
where 
terrain 
is 
hilly 
and 
rocky. 
Estimated 
unit 
capital 
costs 
and 
target 
areas 
are 
US$1,02Sha 
and 
180 
ha 
for 
PVC 
pipeline 
systems, 
and 
US$1,2SOha 
and 
420 
ha 
for 
GI 
pipeline 
systems. 
The 
total 
target 
area 
is 
600 
ha, 
and 
the 
total 
estimated 
capital 
cost 
is 
US$709,500. 
Adding 
the 
incremental 
O&M 
allowances gives 
an overall 
estimated 
baseline cost 
of 
US$747,600. 
In 
this 
case 
also, 
the 
proposed 
capital 
cost 
contributions 
by 
the 
direct beneficiary 
water 
users are 
40% 
of 
material 
and 
20% 
of 
installation 
costs. 
Implementation 
aspects 
of 
this 
sub-component have been 
considered 
comparable 
to 
those 
of 
the 
previous 
one 
above, 
farmer 
acceptance 
included.  However, 
the 
preparatory study and design requirements 
would 
be 
greater, 
as 
would 
be 
the 
potential 
for 
disruption 
to 
irrigation 
operations. 
Following 
the 
initial 
institutional 
development 
efforts, 
quite 
intensive 
sub-component 
implementation activities 
are 
planned 
for 
the 
period 
from 
mid-Year 
2 
to 
mid-Year 
4, 
with 
reduced 
activities 
later. 
Sub-component 
1 
(c) 
- 
Introduction 
of 
modern 
on-farm 
pressurized 
irrigation 
systems. 
The 
two 
previous 
sub-components 
address 
the 
problem 
of 
water 
wastages 
due 
to 
deficiencies 
in 
the 
irrigation delivery 
(conveyance 
and 
distribution) 
systems 
down 
to 
but 
excluding 
the 
field 
level. 
Under 
this 
third 
sub-component, 
the 
introduction 
of 
various 
proven modern 
pressurized 
systems 
that integrate 
both 
distribution 
and 
field 
application 
systems at 
on-farm 
level 
is 
projected. 
This 
would 
be carried 
out 
in 
areas 
with 
conveyance 
systems 
that 
are 
already 
fully-closed 
pipeline 
systems. 
The resulting 
irrigation 
efficiency 
increases 
are 
estimated 
at 
about 
35%. 
The 
sub-component 
includes: 
(a) 
detailed 
study, 
design 
and supervision 
of 
system 
installations; 
(b) 
provision 
of 
head 
reservoirs; 
(c) 
supply 
and 
installation of 
booster 
pumps 
and fertilizer  injectors; 
(d) 
supply 
and 
installation 
of 
on-farm and 
field 
system networks, 
including 
conveyance pipelines,  mains, 
sub-mains, 
laterals 
and 
emitters 
(bubblers,  drippers, 
sprinklers 
and 
mini-sprinklersimicro-sprayers); 
and 
(e) 
corresponding 
incremental 
O&M 
during 
the 
project 
period. 
Estimated 
capital 
costs 
and 
target 
areas 
are 
given 
in 
the 
table 
below.  The 
total 
estimated 
capital 
cost 
is 
US$4,947,000. 
Adding 
the 
incremental 
O&M 
allowances gives 
an 
overall 
estimated baseline cost 
of 
US$S,277,744.

Previous 
project 
experience 
has 
shown  that 
bubbler 
systems 
generally 
are 
well 
adapted 
to 
the 
agro-climatic, 
technical 
and 
social 
situation 
in 
the country. 
They 
work 
well 
with 
the 
commonly 
grown 
and preferred 
crops, 
are 
easy 
to 
design 
and 
manage, 
and 
are 
acceptable 
to 
farmers. 
This 
explains 
the 
relatively 
heavy 
focus 
on 
bubbler 
systems 
within 
this 
sub-component. 
Their introduction 
is 
primarily 
aimed 
at 
areas 
where 
the 
normally 
predominant 
crops (qat 
and 
grapes) are 
grown. 
In 
contrast, 
drip 
systems 
are 
better suited 
for vegetable 
and 
fruit 
tree 
areas, 
and 
it 
is 
planned 
to 
pilot 
them 
in 
such 
areas. 
Piloting 
of 
mini-sprinkler 
or 
micro-sprayer 
systems 
is 
intended 
for 
areas 
under grape 
to which 
they 
are 
considered 
most 
suited. 
Sprinkler 
systems  are 
seen 
to 
be 
the  least 
favorable  technology 
for 
wide 
application, 
but 
they 
may 
represent a 
preferred 
system 
for limited 
areas 
under 
mixed 
crops 
(grains, 
forages 
and 
some 
vegetables), 
hence 
their 
piloting 
is 
projected 
accordingly.  Proposed 
direct beneficiary 
contributions 
to 
capital 
costs 
of 
these systems are 
25% 
of 
material 
and equipment 
costs 
and 
10% 
of 
installation 
costs.

cost 
(US$) 
In 
the 
case 
of 
this 
sub-component, because 
of 
the direct on-farm 
impacts, 
it 
is 
expected that 
initially 
there 
would 
not 
be 
a 
very 
wide 
farmer 
acceptance 
of 
the 
proposed 
system 
modernization. 
The 
initial 
social 
mobilization 
and 
institutional 
development 
efforts 
would 
need 
to 
address 
this 
issue, 
particularly 
through 
organized demonstration 
visits 
to 
previously modemized 
irrigation 
areas. 
Subsequently, a 
reasonably 
moderate 
implementation 
effort 
for 
installation 
of 
pilot 
pressurized 
systems 
under 
this 
sub-component 
is 
planned 
for 
mid-Year 
2 
to 
mid-Year 
3 period, 
to 
be 
followed 
by 
more 
intensive 
implementation activities 
over 
the 
remaining project 
period. 
Sub-comuonent

(d) 
- 
Other 
farm-level 
irrigation 
protection 
and 
imurovement 
measures. 
(i) 
Wadi 
bank 
urotection 
and 
(ii) 
land 
leveling. 
Wadi 
bank 
protection works 
may be 
warranted at 
some 
critical 
locations 
where other 
project works and 
investments 
could 
be 
at 
risk 
of 
damage 
from 
flash 
floods. 
This 
sub-component 
therefore includes 
some 
provisions 
for 
study, 
design, 
construction 
and 
incremental 
O&M 
of 
small-scale 
gabion 
and 
other 
protection works 
for 
these 
locations. 
In 
addition, 
within 
that 
portion 
of 
the 
project 
area 
that 
is 
not 
designated 
for 
installation 
of 
modern on-farm 
pressurized 
irrigation 
systems, 
there 
are 
several 
mixed 
crop 
and 
fruit 
tree 
areas 
where 
it 
is 
judged 
that 
irrigation 
efficiencies 
would 
be markedly 
improved 
by 
land 
leveling. 
Provisions 
are 
therefore 
also 
made 
under 
this 
sub-component 
for 
topographic 
studies, 
field 
designs 
and 
land 
leveling 
operations, 
plus 
incremental 
O&M 
to 
be 
executed 
in 
conjunction 
with 
the  delivery 
system 
upgrades 
and 
conversions 
of 
sub-components 
l(a) 
and 
l(b). 
The 
target 
areas 
for 
this 
are 
199 
ha 
within 
the 
upgrade 
areas 
and 
116 
ha 
within 
the conversion 
areas, 
totalling 
315 
ha 
overall. 
It 
has 
been 
estimated that a 
lump 
sum 
allowance 
of 
US$200,000 
would 
be 
adequate 
to 
cover the 
capital 
costs 
of 
both 
the 
wadi 
bank protection 
and 
the 
land 
leveling 
works. 
Adding 
the 
incremental 
O&M 
allowances gives 
an 
overall 
estimated baseline  cost 
of 
US$210,400. 
Beneficiary 
farmers 
would 
contribute 
40% 
of 
material 
and 
20% 
of 
installation 
costs 
of 
wadi 
bank 
protection 
works, 
and 
20% 
of 
the costs 
of 
land 
leveling 
works.

Introduction 
of 
plastic 
coversltunnels 
for 
irrigated 
crops. 
Plastic 
tunnelslcovers 
for 
crops 
are 
potentially 
attractive 
means 
of 
reducing overall 
water 
use, 
not 
through  reduced water 
losses 
but 
through 
crop 
evapo-transpiration reductions. 
They 
also 
offer 
other 
crop 
production 
benefits. 
They 
are 
best 
suited 
to 
vegetable 
cropping 
areas 
irrigated 
with 
modem 
localized 
(non-sprinkler) 
systems. 
Provisions 
are 
made 
under 
this 
sub-component 
for 
studies, 
designs, 
supply, 
installation 
and 
incremental 
O&M 
of 
plastic tunnelhover 
systems, 
and corresponding farmer training. 
This 
would 
be 
for 
demonstration 
vegetable 
plots 
within 
the 
areas 
targeted 
for 
modern 
localized irrigation 
system 
installations 
under 
sub-component 
1 
(c) 
and 
would 
be 
implemented 
in 
conjunction 
with 
these 
for 
selected 
volunteer 
farmers. 
The 
estimated 
capital 
cost 
is 
US$8,000ha 
and 
the 
target 
area 
is 
10 
ha, 
giving 
a 
total 
capital 
cost estimate 
of 
US$80,000. 
Adding 
the incremental 
O&M 
allowances 
gives 
an 
overall 
estimated 
baseline cost 
of 
US$88,000. 
Beneficiary 
farmers 
would 
contribute 
25% 
of 
the 
material and 
10% 
of 
the 
installation 
costs 
for 
plastic 
coversltunnels.

O&M 
svstems. 
The defined 
target 
irrigation 
improvement 
areas 
within 
each 
of 
the 
8 selected sub-catchments represent 
roughly 
between 
20% 
and 
50% 
of 
the 
corresponding 
total 
sub-catchment 
irrigated 
areas. 
Specific 
sub-catchment 
intervention 
areas 
would 
be 
selected 
with 
the corresponding communities 
and 
farmers 
in 
a 
participatory 
and 
demand-responsive 
manner, 
ensuring that 
important 
project 
criteria 
and conditions, 
including 
both 
physical 
and 
socio-institutional-financial 
factors,  are met. 
The 
process 
would 
include 
joint 
communitylproject 
surveys 
and 
assessments 
of 
farmer  groups,  wells, 
irrigation 
systems, 
service 
areas, 
cropping 
pattems 
and 
financial 
aspects. 
This 
would 
be 
integrated 
with 
the 
social 
mobilization 
effort 
aimed 
at 
establishing 
the needed 
institutional 
organizations 
for 
water management 
at 
village 
level, 
i.e., 
WUAs. 
The provisions 
made 
under 
this 
sub-component 
cover 
these 
initial 
social 
mobilization 
and 
socio-institutional 
assessmenthaseline  survey 
tasks, 
as 
well 
as 
the  subsequent 
community 
water 
management 
training 
and  extension 
programs, 
The 
corresponding  estimated 
baseline  costs 
are 
US$79

would 
correspond 
to 
about 
400 
wells 
in 
20 
villages. 
Since 
some 
villages 
may 
not 
wish 
to 
take 
part 
in 
the 
project, 
or 
may 
lack 
the 
qualifications 
needed 
for 
successful 
project 
interventions, 
it 
is 
assumed 
that  at 
least 
30 
candidate 
villages 
would 
be 
visited 
for  initial 
discussions 
and 
assessments. 
The 
candidate 
villages 
would 
be 
chosen 
at 
the 
start 
of 
the 
project 
in 
accordance 
with 
criteria applied 
during 
project 
preparation, 
and 
are 
likely to 
include 
most 
of 
the villages 
surveyed 
at 
that 
time. 
Within 
each village, 
the 
initial 
assessment 
would 
need 
to 
broadly 
consider 
all 
of 
the 
wells, 
and 
their 
irrigation 
systems 
and 
cropped 
areas, 
before 
arriving 
at 
a 
mutually 
acceptable 
selection 
of 
wells, 
systems 
and 
areas 
to 
be 
improved 
under 
the 
project. 
The 
corresponding 
institutional 
organization 
effort 
would 
be directed 
at 
formalizing 
all 
well 
WUGs 
in 
the 
village 
(not 
only 
those 
which 
would 
be 
selected for 
irrigation 
system improvements), 
and 
at 
establishing 
village-level 
WUAs 
of 
which 
all 
of 
the 
village 
WUGs 
would 
be 
members. 
Training, 
support  and extension programs 
would 
be 
developed 
for 
and directed 
to 
these 
same 
water 
management 
entities. 
The 
WUGlWUA 
social 
mobilization 
and 
irrigation 
welllsystedarea 
assessment 
tasks 
are 
planned 
for 
execution 
over the 
first 
four 
years 
of 
the 
project. 
For 
this, 
two 
3-person 
local 
SMTs 
would work 
in 
parallel 
in 
separate 
assigned 
sub-catchments, 
and 
would 
be 
supported 
by 
a 
local 
surveyor  and 
small 
survey team 
for 
the 
physical 
system and 
socio-institutional 
assessments. 
The 
SMTs 
would initially 
undergo 
training, conduct social 
mobilization, 
and 
become 
familiar 
with 
their 
assigned 
sub-catchments, 
communities 
and 
project 
beneficiaries. 
They 
would 
also 
provide 
relevant 
supportltraining and 
extension 
-47- 
Page  52
services 
to 
the communities over 
the 
last 
three 
years 
of 
the 
project 
and 
beyond, 
as 
needed. 
The 
farmer, 
WUG 
and 
WUA 
training 
programs 
would 
develop water 
resource, 
imgation, 
agricultural, 
institutional and 
financial 
management 
understanding and 
skills. 
They 
would 
complement 
both 
the 
socio-institutional 
developments described above 
and 
the 
physical 
system 
improvement 
studies, 
designs 
and 
installations 
covered 
by 
the 
previous 
sub-components. 
Some 
provision 
is 
also made 
for 
assistance 
to 
farmers 
and 
WUA 
officials 
for 
visiting 
sites 
and 
WAS 
elsewhere 
in 
the 
Sana’a 
Basin 
or 
adjacent 
areas, 
where 
current 
or 
previous project 
interventions 
may 
serve 
as 
useful 
demonstrations 
of 
the 
nature and 
benefits 
of 
water 
management’s 
physical 
and 
institutional 
improvements. 
A 
cyclical 
development 
approach 
is 
planned, 
aimed 
at commencing 
project 
interventions 
within 
a 
few 
villages 
in 
the 
first 
year 
and 
within 
similar 
or 
greater numbers 
of 
villages 
in 
the 
subsequent 
three 
years. 
This 
provides 
an 
opportunity 
for 
improvement 
of 
implementation 
processes 
and 
methodologies 
through 
modifications 
and 
refinements 
based 
on 
initial 
application 
experiences. 
Since 
project 
interventions 
are 
viewed 
as 
pilots, 
upper, 
middle 
and 
lower 
sub-catchment 
areas 
would 
be 
equitably 
represented. 
Within 
and 
between 
sub-catchments, 
an 
upstream 
to 
downstream 
development 
progression 
would 
be followed. 
This 
should 
allow 
the 
project 
to 
better 
address 
the 
effects 
of 
earlier 
interventions 
on 
later 
ones. 
Sub-component

Caoacitv 
building 
for 
irrigation 
svstems 
develooment 
and 
extension 
(MAI). 
The 
MAI, 
through 
its 
local 
Sana’a 
unit 
andlor 
extension 
agencies, 
would 
need 
to 
assume 
a 
partnership 
role 
in 
the project’s 
demand management development, 
training 
and 
extension activities. 
This 
would 
be 
achieved 
through 
its 
close 
and 
frequent 
liaison 
with 
the 
project, 
and 
perhaps 
more 
directly 
through 
staff 
secondment 
or 
other contractual 
arrangements 
for 
local 
extension 
agents. 
The 
MAI 
local 
unit 
is 
expected 
to 
be the 
agency 
that would, 
upon 
project 
completion, 
assume 
responsibility 
for 
needed 
continued 
and 
ongoing 
support 
to 
water 
users 
for 
irrigation 
system developments 
and 
demand management 
activities 
in 
the 
Sana’a 
Basin. 
This 
sub-component 
therefore 
covers 
capacity 
building 
that 
may 
be 
needed 
for 
MA1 
to 
take 
on 
this 
task. 
Relevant 
training 
programs 
for 
the 
staff 
are 
provided 
for,  together 
with 
joint 
agencyfWUA 
study 
tours 
to 
comparable 
locations 
within 
Yemen, 
where 
similar 
project interventions 
have 
proved 
successful. 
Allowance 
is 
also made 
for 
a 
number 
of 
formal 
education 
programs 
for 
suitable 
staff 
to 
be 
supported 
by 
the 
project.  The 
estimated baseline cost 
for 
this 
sub-component 
is 
US$122,000. 
Subcomponent 
1 
(E) 
- 
Component 
1 
implementation 
sup~ort. 
The project 
management 
philosophy 
favors 
contracting out 
of 
all 
or 
most 
of 
the 
project implementation 
tasks. 
The preferred 
Component 
1 
implementation 
arrangement 
is: 
(i) 
for 
the 
physical 
works 
and 
equipment 
supply 
and installation,  covered 
by 
sub-components l(a), 
l(b), 
l(c) 
and 
l(d) 
above, 
to 
be 
tendered 
and 
contracted out 
to 
contractors 
and 
manufacturerslsuppliers, 
and 
(ii) 
for 
a 
suitably 
qualified 
and 
experienced 
consulting 
firm 
to 
be 
engaged 
to 
oversee 
all 
of 
the 
Component 
1 
interventions, 
both 
physical 
and socio-institutional. 
The consulting 
firm 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
implementation 
studies, 
design 
and 
construction  supervision 
relating 
to 
the 
physical 
system improvements,  also 
covered 
by 
sub-components 
l(a), 
l(b), 
l(c) 
and 
l(d) 
above, 
and 
for 
the 
institutional 
development 
and 
capacity 
building 
tasks, 
partially 
covered 
by 
sub-components 
l(e) 
and 
l(f) 
above. 
The 
present sub-component 
l(g) 
covers 
the 
remaining 
estimated 
consulting 
firm 
contract 
scope 
and 
costs, 
for 
(i) 
general 
overall 
Component 
1

and 
administration, 
and 
(ii) 
specific 
support 
items 
relating to 
the 
institutional 
development 
and 
capacity 
building 
tasks. 
They provide 
for 
technical and managerial 
direction 
and 
assistance 
from 
well 
qualified 
regional 
or 
international 
consultants, needed 
vehicles and 
equipment, 
and 
field 
and 
office 
operations 
and 
supplies. 
The 
estimated 
baseline 
cost 
is 
US$1,168,000.

The  objectives 
of 
this 
component 
are: 
(a) 
to 
enhance 
groundwater  recharge 
through 
new 
artificial 
recharge 
schemes 
including 
conventional 
dams, 
sub-surface 
dams 
and 
other  structures, 
mainly 
to 
the 
Quatemarly 
Alluvial 
aquifer, 
to 
allow 
farmers 
to 
pump 
from 
shallow 
aquifers 
instead 
of 
deep 
aquifers 
that 
are 
critical 
for 
drinking 
water 
supply 
for 
Sana'a 
City; 
(b) 
to 
rehabilitate 
existing 
darns 
that 
need 
urgent 
intervention 
to 
prevent 
potential dam 
failure 
as 
well 
as 
to 
recover recharge 
capacity 
diminished 
by 
accumulated 
sediments; 
and 
(c) 
to 
establish 
a sustainable 
dam 
management 
system 
through 
strengthened 
capacity 
of 
MAI's 
GDI 
as 
well 
as 
participation 
of 
newly 
established 
WAS 
and 
WUFs 
in 
O&M 
activities 
and 
their 
fbding. 
During 
project 
preparation, 
after 
identifying 
and 
examining 
24 
existing 
dams 
requiring rehabilitation 
and 
9 
potentially viable 
new 
dams, 
a systematic 
ranking 
and selection 
process was 
carried 
out. 
Low 
safety 
hazard 
and 
poor local 
social 
support 
led 
to initial 
elimination 
of 
a 
number 
of 
candidate 
dams. 
Ranking 
of 
dams 
for 
rehabilitation 
was 
then 
based 
primarily 
on 
recharge 
potential, 
safety 
hazard and 
social 
support 
factors.  Recharge 
potential 
and socio-environmental factors were 
the 
primaxy 
criteria 
used 
in 
the 
ranking 
of 
potential 
new 
darns. 
The 
process 
led 
to 
selection 
of 
11 
existing 
and 
5 
new 
dams 
to 
be 
covered under 
the project. 
Of 
the 
5 
potential 
dams, 
4 
would 
be 
conventional 
dams 
while 
the 
fifth 
would 
be 
a series 
of 
cascadelcheck 
dams. 
Details 
of 
the selected 
dams are

In 
relation 
to 
the 
selected 
11 
existing 
and 
4 
new 
conventional 
dams, 
the Component 2 
project provisions 
include 
for  final 
detailed 
studies  and 
designs, 
physical  works 
execution  and 
supervision, 
and 
corresponding incremental 
O&M 
within 
the 
period 
of 
the project. 
The 
component also 
provides 
for 
detailed 
definition 
studies 
relating to 
potential 
subsurface 
dams 
and other 
viable 
and 
cost-effective 
recharge 
systems, 
including 
a 
series 
of 
cascadelcheck 
dams, 
as 
well 
as 
an 
allowance 
for 
subsequent 
implementation 
of 
the 
most 
favored 
of 
these 
structures. 
Implementation 
of 
this 
component, 
including 
the 
final 
detailed 
studies 
and 
designs 
of 
dams, 
is 
to 
be 
carried out 
with 
the 
participation 
and 
full 
agreement 
of 
the 
affected 
communities 
and, 
above all, 
in 
consultation 
with 
those 
who 
are 
or would 
be 
entrusted 
with 
care 
and 
maintenance 
of 
the structures. 
In 
advance 
of 
physical 
interventions, 
social 
mobilization 
and 
financial 
assessment 
would 
take 
place at 
village 
and 
wadi 
branch 
levels 
to 
set 
up 
suitable 
institutional 
arrangements 
for 
O&M, 
in 
the 
form 
of 
user 
associations. 
Works 
would 
then be carried 
out 
in 
parallel 
with 
capacity 
building 
and 
training 
programs 
for both 
dam 
management 
and extension 
service entities. 
For 
capital 
costs 
of 
works 
of 
this 
project 
component, 
it 
is 
not 
proposed 
to 
seek 
contributions 
from 
the 
beneficiary 
communities. 
This 
applies also 
to 
those 
O&M 
costs 
that relate 
directly 
to 
dam 
structure 
performance 
and 
safety. 
It 
is 
intended that 
GDI 
would 
take 
on 
the 
responsibility 
for 
such 
routine 
inspections 
and 
remedial 
works. 
However, 
it 
is 
proposed that the 
local 
beneficiary 
communities 
would 
carry out 
or 
arrange 
for: 
(a) 
dry 
season 
sediment 
removal 
from 
reservoirs 
to 
improve 
recharge; 
and 
(b) 
upkeep 
of 
dam 
and 
reservoir 
access roads, 
all 
on 
an 
annual 
basis. 
Beneficiary contributions 
to 
O&M 
costs 
may 
be 
between 
10% 
and 
20%, 
but 
will 
be 
assessed 
early 
on 
by 
sociallwillingness-to-pay 
surveys. 
Benefits 
of 
this 
component 
may 
accrue 
not only 
to 
the 
local 
sub-basin 
communities 
but 
also 
to 
water 
users 
in 
other 
extended 
areas 
of 
the 
Sana’a 
Basin, 
During 
the course 
of 
the 
project, 
it 
is 
expected 
that 
a 
better 
identification 
of 
the 
overall 
beneficiaries 
would 
be 
obtained. 
For 
implementation 
management 
and 
monitoring 
purposes, 
six 
sub-components 
of 
this 
second 
project 
component 
have  been 
defined. 
These 
cover 
technical 
interventions, 
institutional 
development 
and 
implementation 
support 
aspects, 
as 
summarized 
below. 
Sub-component 
2(a) 
- 
Rehabilitation 
of 
existing 
recharge 
dams. 
This 
sub-component  covers 
the 
final 
studies 
and 
designs, 
works 
execution  and 
supervision, 
and 
incremental 
O&M 
for 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
11 
existing 
dams 
in 
the 
Sana’a 
Basin. 
The required works 
vary 
between the 
dams 
but 
may 
include: 
(a) 
dam 
body 
and foundation 
repairs 
and 
improvements 
for 
enhanced  safety 
and 
operation, 
dam 
stability, 
flood 
discharge 
capacity, 
outlet 
performance, 
leakagelseepage 
control 
and erosion protection, 
plus 
other 
works 
such 
as 
temporary 
site 
buildings 
and 
facilities; 
and 
(b) 
reservoir 
area 
desilting 
for 
enhanced  recharge, 
and 
access 
roads 
upgrading 
or 
construction 
for 
improved 
O&M. 
The 
defined 
scope 
of 
these 
categories 
of 
work, 
in 
terms 
of 
capital 
cost 
estimates, 
is 
summarized 
for 
each 
dam 
in 
the 
table 
below. 
The 
table 
also shows 
the 
estimate 
for 
corresponding 
detailed 
design 
(7%) 
plus 
construction supervision 
(5%). 
The 
total 
estimated 
capital 
cost 
for 
rehabilitation 
of 
the 
11 
existing 
dams 
is 
US$3,391,516. 
Adding 
the incremental 
O&M 
allowances gives 
an 
overall 
estimated baseline 
cost 
of 
US$3,466,877.

With 
regard 
to 
implementation 
approach 
and 
timing 
for 
dam 
rehabilitation, 
it 
is 
projected 
that 
during 
Year 
1 
the process 
would 
start 
for 
three 
dams 
(Thoma, 
Tozan 
and 
Beryan) 
whose 
rehabilitation 
is 
considered 
to 
have 
the 
highest 
priority. 
The 
procedures 
and 
methodologies 
for 
an 
integrated 
technical 
and 
institutional 
development  process 
(community 
assessment 
and  mobilization, 
final 
studies 
and 
designs, 
set 
up 
of 
institutional 
arrangements, 
tendering and 
contracting 
of 
works, 
works 
execution, 
and 
initial 
routine 
O&M) 
are 
part 
of 
implementation 
of 
project 
tasks. 
They 
would 
be 
refined 
as 
appropriate 
for 
subsequent 
application 
to 
the 
remaining dam 
rehabilitation. 
The 
process 
is 
planned 
to 
commence 
for 
four 
further 
dams 
(Al-Masham, 
Eial 
Hussein, 
Ben 
Naji, 
and 
Al-Arisha) 
during 
Year 
2 
and 
for 
the

This 
sub-component corresponds 
to 
the construction 
of 
4 
selected 
new

in 
the 
Sana’a

(2 
dams 
of 
18 
m 
and 
16 
m 
in

and 
2 dams

It 
covers 
final 
studies 
and

Works 
can 
be 
categorized 
as: 
(a) 
dam

including 
excavation, 
fill

and 
(b)

For

of 
new

the 
implementation 
approach 
and 
timing 
was 
projected 
on 
the 
basis of 
considerations  comparable 
to 
those 
for 
rehabilitation 
of

is 
planned 
to 
commence

The 
primary 
focus 
of 
Component 
2 
is 
on 
conventional 
dams, 
either 
on 
rehabilitation 
of 
existing

to 
restore

generate recharge benefits, 
or 
on

However, 
the

During 
the 
Phase

able 
to 
continue 
and 
expand 
their

on 
a 
long-term

The 
initial 
process, 
to 
be 
supported 
under 
this 
sub-component 
and carried out 
during 
Year

of 
the

would 
be 
drafting, 
discussing, 
agreeing  and 
finalizing 
the 
bylaws  that 
would  allow  for 
meaningful implementation 
of 
the 
Water 
Law. 
Over 
the 
following 
three

and 
introduction 
of 
guidelines, 
systems 
and procedures 
for 
water

would be 
implemented. 
The 
principles,

all 
specific 
investigations, 
inventorying, 
computerized

The 
NWRA 
Sana’a 
branch 
would 
become 
the 
water sector 
regulatory 
agency 
for 
the 
Sana’a

As 
such, 
it 
would 
be 
the 
initial

user 
within 
NWRA 
of 
the 
regulatory

The 
project’s 
institutional 
development 
for 
water 
management 
at 
village 
and 
wadi 
branch 
levels, 
carried 
out 
as 
part 
of 
Components 
1 
and 
2, 
would 
be 
extended 
to 
reach 
the 
first 
level 
of 
sub-catchments 
and 
then 
of 
the 
overall 
Sana’a 
Basin. 
This 
is 
an 
institutional evolution 
that 
would 
advance stakeholder water 
management 
from 
the 
single-source 
(well-field 
or 
wadi) 
level 
of 
the 
WAS 
to 
an 
integrated multi-source 
and 
multi-use 
level 
of 
well-defined natural hydraulic 
units. 
The 
SBC 
would 
comprise 
WUF 
representatives 
plus 
representatives 
of 
GOY 
and 
other 
Sana’a 
Basin 
stakeholder  entities, 
and 
would 
in 
addition 
incorporate 
key 
legal, 
social 
and 
technical 
permanent 
advisors. 
The SBC 
would 
meet 
at 
least 
four 
times annually 
for 
basin-wide  decision-making 
on 
water 
sector 
policies, 
strategies, 
priorities, 
planning,  monitoring, 
implementation 
and 
dispute  settlements. 
Execution 
of 
emerging 
actions 
would 
be  carried 
out, 
supervised 
andor 
monitored 
by 
TS-SBC 
in 
coordination 
with 
WUFslWUAs, 
NWRA, 
MAI, 
NWSA 
and 
other 
agencies. 
Also, 
most importantly, 
the 
commission  would,  through 
its 
chairperson,  have 
the 
authority 
to 
refer 
important 
unresolved 
issues 
directly 
to 
the 
Prime Minister’s office. 
The SBC 
was established (Cabinet Decree 
# 
263, 
of 
September 
10, 
2002). 
A 
TS-SBC 
would 
be 
created 
and 
attached 
to 
the 
SBC 
for 
project 
oversight 
and 
management. 
The 
possible conversion 
of 
SBC 
into 
a 
Sana’a 
Basin 
Agency 
would 
be 
studied. 
A 
small 
team 
of 
professional 
institutional 
and water 
management experts 
would 
focus 
exclusively 
on 
WUF 
and SBC 
institutional 
development 
aspects. 
These 
interventions 
are 
planned 
to 
occur at about the 
mid-point 
of 
the 
project 
period. 
This 
would tie 
into 
Component

and 
2 
socio-institutional 
developments 
achieved 
during 
the 
first 
part 
of 
the

this 
sub-component 
is

Provisions 
are 
made 
for 
the setup 
and 
execution 
of 
a comprehensive 
hydrogeological 
and 
water 
resource 
monitoring 
and 
investigation 
program. 
It 
aims 
at 
a 
better understanding and 
quantification 
of 
Sana’a 
Basin 
surface and 
groundwater 
resources 
availability, 
and 
at 
achieving realistic 
estimations 
of 
the 
impacts 
of 
water 
saving and 
aquifer 
recharge investments 
in 
the 
basin. 
Details 
are 
summarized 
in 
the 
four 
sub-sections 
below. 
An 
extension 
of 
the 
investigations 
to 
areas 
outside 
of 
the basin 
may 
also 
be 
warranted. 
This 
would 
be 
for 
assessment 
of 
potential additional 
water 
sources 
not 
previously 
studied. 
One 
of 
these 
could 
be

Aauifer 
Storage 
Investigations 
and 
Assessment: 
This 
investigation 
and 
assessment 
package 
would 
aim 
at 
quantifying 
the  storage 
volume 
of 
the  Cretaceous 
Sandstone 
and 
overlying 
Quaternary 
Alluvial 
aquifers, 
both 
the 
portions 
already 
drained and the 
portions 
that 
would 
be drained over the 
coming 
years. 
It 
would 
focus 
on 
the 
aquifers 
underlying 
the 
irrigation 
areas 
in 
the 
vicinity 
of 
the 
NWSA 
NW 
and 
NE 
wellfields. 
The 
package 
would 
include: 
(a) 
construction 
of 
maps 
and 
sections 
to 
delineate 
the 
aquifers and the 
amount 
of 
historical 
depletion; 
(b) 
qualitative geological 
assessment 
of 
water 
storage properties; 
(c) 
drilling 
of 
three 
exploratory 
boreholes 
for 
core 
sampling, 
geophysical 
logging, groundwater 
sampling; 
and 
(d) 
laboratory 
testing 
of 
rock 
drill 
cores 
and 
field 
samples. 
The 
assessment 
would 
make 
use 
of 
both 
historic 
and 
current 
well 
inventory 
data 
relating 
to 
groundwater 
levels  and 
abstractions, 
and 
all 
available  geological 
information. 
Expected 
outputs 
include 
substantially 
improved 
estimates 
of 
hydrogeological 
characteristics and 
of 
groundwater 
availability. 
Three observation 
wells 
for 
future 
groundwater 
monitoring 
would 
also 
be 
drilled. 
Further details 
are 
available 
in 
the project file. 
The 
assessment 
would 
be 
carried out 
in 
the 
first 
year 
of 
the 
project 
by 
a 
small 
team 
of 
international 
and 
local 
consultants, 
and 
NWRA 
staff. 
The 
corresponding 
estimated baseline cost 
is 
US$804,400. 
(ii) 
Hvdrological 
Monitoring 
and 
Analvses: 
The  project 
would 
also 
provide 
for 
an  intensive 
hydrological  monitoring 
and 
analysis 
program 
at 
three 
levels: 
(a) 
sample  sub-basin 
level, 
for 
monitoring 
and analyzing 
of 
groundwater levels, 
abstraction 
volumes, chemistry, 
as 
well 
as 
rainfall 
and 
surface 
water  flows, 
to 
determine the 
impacts 
of 
recharge enhancement 
interventions 
and 
to 
establish 
sub-basin 
water 
balances; 
(b) 
field 
level, 
for 
monitoring 
and 
analyzing 
of 
water 
deliveries, 
beneficial 
ET, 
non-beneficial 
ET 
and evaporation, 
soil 
moisture 
content, 
runoff 
and 
deep 
percolation, 
to 
estimate 
field 
water 
balances 
and net water 
savinglrecharge  impacts; 
and 
(c) 
basin 
level, 
for 
deriving overall 
Sana’a 
Basin 
water 
balances. 
Further 
details 
are 
available 
in 
the 
project 
file. 
The 
basin-level 
hydrological monitoring 
would 
be 
conducted 
by 
the 
NWRA 
Sana’a 
Branch, 
while 
the sub-basin 
and 
field-level 
monitoring 
would 
be carried 
out 
by 
the 
specialized 
MAI 
monitoring 
and 
extension 
units 
(e.g. 
CWMU 
and 
AREA). 
Support 
in 
the 
form 
of 
equipment 
and 
incremental 
staff 
costs 
would 
be 
provided 
under  the  project. 
The 
corresponding  estimated 
baseline  cost 
is 
US$467,000. 
Specific 
hydrological 
analyses 
and 
evaluations 
would 
be 
performed 
at 
three 
points 
in 
time 
during 
the 
course 
of 
the 
project. 
An 
early (Year 
1) 
study 
for 
baseline 
assessment 
would 
be followed 
by 
middle 
(Year 
3) 
and 
late (Year 
5) 
studies 
for 
mid-term 
and 
fmal 
impact 
assessments. 
The 
results 
would 
be 
compared 
and combined 
with 
monitoring 
program 
results 
to 
date, 
as 
well 
as 
available 
historical 
data, 
current 
well 
inventory 
data, 
supplementary 
study-specific 
investigations, 
outputs 
from 
the 
aquifer 
assessment 
study 
(see 
above), 
from 
the satellite 
imagery and aquifer 
modeling 
studies 
(see 
below). 
A 
small 
team 
of 
international 
and 
local 
consultants 
would 
analyze 
the 
data 
with 
NWRA 
and 
MAI 
staff. 
The 
estimated baseline cost 
for 
this 
is 
US$214,800. 
(iii) 
Satellite 
Imagerv 
Studies: 
Advanced remote sensinglsatellite imagery 
studies 
with 
extended 
ground 
truthing 
would 
be performed 
at 
the 
same 
three 
points 
in 
time 
as 
the 
hydrological 
analyses 
(early, 
middle 
and 
late 
project 
period) 
and 
would 
provide 
input 
to 
all 
levels 
of 
these 
(field, 
sub-basin 
and 
basin). 
The 
studies 
would 
seek 
to 
estimate 
cropped 
and 
irrigated 
areas, 
cropping 
patterns 
and 
evapo-transpiration levels, 
all 
of 
which 
are 
important 
for 
project 
impact 
and water 
balance 
analyses. 
International 
and 
local 
consultants supported 
by 
NWRA 
and 
MAI 
staff 
would 
be 
in 
charge 
of 
the 
-

studies. 
The 
estimated baseline cost 
for 
these 
is 
US$263,000. 
(iv) 
Aauifer  Modeling 
Studies: 
Based 
on 
the 
results 
of 
the 
hydrogeological 
investigations 
and 
assessments, 
refined 
aquifer 
characteristic  values 
and 
abstraction 
estimates 
would 
be 
used 
in 
the 
updating 
of 
the 
basin-wide aquifer 
model 
(USGS 
MODFLOW) 
and 
subsequent 
simulating 
of 
current 
(for 
verification) 
and 
potential 
future 
aquifer 
use scenarios. 
International and 
local 
consultants 
supported 
by 
NWRA 
and 
MAI 
staff 
would 
conduct the 
modeling 
work. 
The 
estimated 
baseline 
cost 
for 
this 
is 
US$59,400. 
(v) 
Monitoring 
Water 
Ouantitv. 
Oualitv 
and Pollution: 
A 
system 
would 
be 
developed 
for 
the 
selected 
four 
sub-basins 
to  monitor 
and 
record rainfall, 
wadi 
flow, 
evaporation, 
groundwater  level, 
and 
recharge 
rates. 
Data 
recording, 
collection 
and 
analysis 
mechanisms 
would 
be 
established, 
emphasizing 
sustainable 
community 
management. 
In 
particular, groundwater levels 
would 
be 
closely 
monitored 
to 
check 
pumping 
regulation 
and 
recharge effects. 
Deep boreholes 
and 
Sana'a 
basin-wide 
monitoring 
would 
also 
be 
conducted 
to 
better 
understand 
hydrogeological 
and 
geological formations 
and aquifer 
balance. 
The 
equipment, 
investigation 
and 
recurrent 
costs 
for 
monitoring, the latter 
on 
a 
declining 
basis, 
as 
well 
as 
training 
would 
be 
provided 
by 
the 
project. 
NWRA 
Sana'a 
Branch 
and 
its 
designated 
community 
groups 
would 
assume 
primary 
responsibly 
for 
these 
activities. 
Other 
monitoring 
measures are 
planned 
in 
the project, 
including 
groundwater 
pollution 
and pesticide 
residuals, 
to 
be monitored 
by 
NWRA 
Sana'a 
Branch 
with 
MAI 
PPD. 
As 
existing 
data 
in 
these 
areas 
are 
limited, 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
establish 
a baseline 
from 
which 
any 
changes 
can 
be 
measured. 
In 
addition,  the 
quality 
of 
WWTP 
effluent 
and 
sludge 
would 
be 
monitored 
by 
the 
Sana'a 
Local 
Corporation. 
EPA 
would 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
the established 
standards. 
The 
estimated 
baseline 
cost 
for 
this 
is 
US$252,000.

Despite 
past 
GOY 
efforts 
at 
raising public 
awareness 
of 
the 
severe 
water scarcity 
in 
the 
Sana'a 
Basin, 
the 
level 
of 
understanding 
of 
the 
impending crisis 
among 
the 
public 
at 
large, 
including 
many 
politicians 
and 
decision-makers, 
is 
still 
weak. 
The 
PAC 
would 
consist 
of 
an 
intense 
four-year 
program 
to 
convey 
nuanced 
messages 
of 
water conservation 
to 
well-targeted 
population 
segments. 
Specifically, 
it 
would 
address: 
(a) 
schools, 
both

(b) 
parliamentarians; 
(c) 
journalists; 
(d)

WUAs 
and 
LC 
meetings); 
(f) 
industrial 
users; 
and 
(g) 
rural 
and 
urban 
domestic  interests groups. 
The 
campaign, 
designed 
as 
an 
initial 
four-year program, 
would likely 
continue 
as 
an 
open-ended endeavor 
to 
conserve the 
livelihood 
of 
the 
basin. 
It 
would 
use 
a

would 
provide 
the 
foundation 
for 
this. 
The 
newly 
established 
NWRA 
Sana’a 
Branch 
(supported 
by 
TS-SBC 
and 
EPA) 
would 
be 
the 
main 
agency 
in 
monitoring 
and 
enforcing 
the 
Water 
Law 
and 
would 
ensure 
that 
the 
main 
provisions 
of 
the 
Mitigation 
Plan 
can 
be 
implemented. 
This 
includes licensing, 
drilling 
of 
new 
wells, 
establishing 
maximum 
abstraction 
rates, 
maintaining 
a 
database 
of 
wells 
and 
boreholes 
in 
the basin, 
monitoring 
water 
quality, and 
overall monitoring 
of 
water 
levels 
and 
quality 
with 
the 
basin 
aquifer. 
Dam 
Safety, 
Siltation 
and 
Downstream 
Effects 
An 
important 
component 
of 
the 
mitigation plan 
is 
to 
ensure 
that 
all 
dams 
and water 
recharge structures 
remain 
safe 
and 
do 
not 
pose a 
threat 
to 
human 
life 
and property. 
Eleven 
dams 
in 
need 
of 
urgent 
repair 
would 
be rehabilitated 
and 
five 
new 
recharge structures 
would 
be 
constructed 
to 
best 
engineering 
practice, supervised 
by 
TS-SBC. 
The 
GDI 
and 
the 
agencies, 
to whom 
TS-SBC 
may 
delegate 
its 
powers, 
would 
undertake 
regular  inspections 
of 
all 
dam 
structures 
to 
ensure 
their 
integrity 
and 
report 
any 
potential 
failures 
to 
the responsible authorities. 
It 
would 
monitor 
speedy 
repairs 
and 
rectification 
of 
any 
faults. 
A 
best 
practice 
of 
dam 
construction manual 
would 
be 
developed 
by 
GDI 
for 
use 
by 
any 
agency 
involved 
in 
dam 
construction. 
A 
dam 
safety 
expert 
would certify 
the 
soundness 
of 
both 
the 
new 
and 
rehabilitated 
dams. 
The 
dam 
sites 
would 
be 
selected 
to 
ensure 
that 
maximum 
infiltration 
would 
take 
place, Agreements 
would 
be 
reached 
with 
downstream 
fanners 
regarding periodic 
discharges 
of 
water 
to 
ensure 
minimum 
impact 
on 
spate 
irrigation 
and other possible 
ecological 
effects 
assessed 
to 
be 
minimal. 
In 
addition, 
farmers, 
as 
part of 
the 
agreement 
to 
construct  a 
dam, 
would 
be 
required 
to 
undertake 
annual 
desilting. 
The 
silt 
which 
has 
a 
high 
nutrient 
value 
can 
be 
used 
as 
a 
soil 
conditioner, 
or 
disposed 
of 
on 
common 
unproductive 
land. 
The 
summary 
of 
the 
dam 
safety 
review 
report produced 
during 
project 
preparation 
is 
available 
in 
the 
project 
file. 
Public 
Health 
The 
mitigation 
of 
any 
public 
health 
risks, 
although 
limited, 
in 
particular 
the 
breeding 
of 
mosquitoes 
and 
aquatic 
snails, 
the 
potential 
vectors 
of 
malaria and 
bilharzia 
would 
be 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
MOPHP 
through 
it’s 
eradication and 
control 
groups 
who 
have expressed 
willingness 
to 
collaborate 
with 
the 
project. 
The 
project 
would 
support 
their 
operations 
through 
funding 
and 
institution 
building. 
The 
control 
measures 
would 
include 
the 
regular inspections 
of 
water 
bodies 
close 
to 
human populations 
to 
detect 
and 
identify 
the 
breeding 
of 
vectors, 
and 
the 
control 
of 
any 
populations 
found 
through 
controlled 
spraying 
of 
insecticides 
and 
molluscicides. 
They 
would 
also advise 
the relevant authorities 
to 
apply physical 
control 
measures 
such 
as 
cutting 
back 
water-side 
vegetation 
and 
lowering 
the water 
level 
in 
the 
dams. 
These 
- 
59 
- 
Page  64
physical 
measures 
are 
very 
effective 
in 
controlling 
the 
bilharzia 
vector. 
In 
parallel, 
as 
part 
of 
the 
communications 
and 
education 
component of the 
project, 
good 
sanitation 
and 
personal 
hygiene 
practices 
would 
be 
promoted 
in 
order 
to 
reduce the transmission 
of 
water-based 
disease 
vectors. 
Any 
increase 
in 
the incidence 
of 
malaria 
andfor 
bilharzia 
would 
be 
monitored through 
the 
monthly 
records 
maintained 
by 
clinics 
and 
health 
facilities 
in 
the 
project 
area. 
In 
order 
to 
reap 
the social 
benefits 
of 
the 
project, 
improve 
public 
health 
and 
in 
particular 
to 
mitigate 
against water-based 
disease 
vectors, 
it 
is 
essential 
to 
improve 
domestic 
water 
supplies 
in 
terms 
of 
quality 
and accessibility, 
and 
personal 
hygiene. 
A 
campaign 
to provide 
increased coverage 
of 
public 
water 
supply 
stand 
posts 
and 
latrines 
should 
be 
launched, together 
with 
a 
hygiene  education 
program 
that 
emphasizes 
safe excreta 
disposal 
and 
hand 
washing. 
Land 
Acquisition 
No 
involuntary 
resettlement 
is 
anticipated 
in 
the 
project.  However, 
agreements 
would 
have 
to 
be 
reached 
with 
the 
local 
community regarding 
land 
acquisition. 
The 
GDI, 
under 
the 
MAI, 
differentiates  between 
land 
acquisition 
for 
large 
public 
works  projects 
and the 
small 
dams 
that 
benefit 
discrete 
farming 
communities. 
Since 
1994, 
GDI 
has 
adopted a pragmatic, demand-based approach 
to 
the 
acquisition 
of 
land 
for 
dam 
construction when 
it 
is 
primarily 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
the 
local 
community. 
The 
procedure 
is 
as 
follows: 
After 
GDI 
receive 
a request 
from 
a 
particular community 
to 
construct 
a 
dam, 
they respond 
by 
conducting 
a 
survey 
of 
the 
area 
and 
producing 
a design 
which 
defines 
the 
land 
requirement 
and 
land 
ownership. 
This 
is 
discussed 
with 
the 
community and 
if 
they 
agree 
to 
go 
ahead, 
they 
sign 
a 
contract 
with 
GDI 
to 
provide 
the 
land 
as 
a 
contribution 
to 
the 
costs. 
The 
communities 
themselves, 
through 
an 
internal 
process, agree 
on 
compensation 
for 
individuals 
whose 
land 
would 
be 
built 
over 
or 
inundated, 
most 
often 
by 
providing land 
in 
an 
alternative location. 
Similarly, 
if 
there 
are 
conflicts 
with 
downstream 
or 
adjacent 
communities, 
they 
must 
reach 
a documented 
agreement 
on 
allocation 
of 
water 
rights 
before 
GDI 
would 
commence 
construction 
of 
the 
dam. 
Similar 
practices 
are 
adopted 
by 
the 
Social 
Development 
Fund 
Project 
and 
the 
Agriculture 
and 
Fisheries 
Development 
Fund. 
This 
procedure 
complies 
with 
the Bank‘s 
Operational Policies, 
if 
the 
agreement 
is 
mutual 
and 
is 
registered 
as 
described 
above. 
The 
following 
translation 
from 
Arabic 
is 
of 
the 
form 
used 
by 
MA1 
to 
reach 
agreement 
with 
the 
communitylland 
owners 
regarding contributing 
land 
for 
dam 
construction. 
The 
form 
is 
signed 
and 
dated 
by 
representatives 
of 
MA1 
and 
the community. 
“We, 
the 
undersigned and owners 
of 
this 
land,  declare 
that 
our 
land 
can 
be 
used 
for 
the 
implementing 
of 
this 
project. 
An 
agreement has 
been reached 
with 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Agriculture 
and 
Irrigation 
declaring 
that 
we 
are 
ready 
to 
give 
up 
our 
land 
for 
the establishment 
of 
this 
project. 
This 
agreement 
includes 
giving 
up 
the 
lake, rocks, 
soil, 
and 
water 
and 
anything 
else 
located 
on 
the 
land 
that 
can 
be 
of 
use 
for 
project 
implementation. 
We 
also declare 
that 
we 
would 
take 
full 
responsibility 
of 
constructing 
a 
road 
through 
which 
cars 
trucks 
and other 
project 
requirements 
could utilize 
at 
our 
expense”. 
Therefore, 
it 
is 
important when 
surveying 
any 
potential 
dam 
site 
to 
determine  the 
extent, 
use 
and 
ownership 
of 
the 
land 
(if 
any) 
that 
would 
be 
required and 
to 
enter 
into 
a 
dialogue 
and 
agreement 
with 
the 
community 
regarding 
the 
transfer. 
This 
should be 
fully 
documented 
and 
legally 
registered 
as 
described 
above. 
Productive 
and private 
land 
should be avoided 
to 
the extent 
possible. 
An 
observer 
should 
ensure 
that 
an 
equitable process 
has 
taken 
place. 
This 
may 
entail 
short-term 
inputs 
from 
a 
social 
scientist. 
As 
in 
the 
majority 
of 
cases, 
this 
would 
be 
“common 
land”, 
the 
impact 
would 
be 
minimal. 
A 
copy 
of 
an 
official 
letter 
from 
MAI 
outlining 
its 
land 
acquisition 
policy 
is 
available 
in 
the 
project file.

Involuntary 
Resettlement 
(OPIBP 
4.12) 
In 
the 
event,  however,  that 
involuntary expropriation may be 
required, 
the 
Borrower 
has 
prepared 
a 
Resettlement 
Policy 
Framework 
(RPF) 
acceptable 
to 
IDA 
and 
disclosed 
it 
locally 
and 
through 
the 
Infoshop. 
The 
RPF 
is 
presented 
as 
Annex 
11. 
When 
a 
dam 
site 
is 
identified, 
the 
Borrower 
submits 
to 
IDA 
a 
Land 
Acquisition 
Plan 
identifying 
the 
site 
and 
its 
key 
characteristics, 
including 
ownership, 
evidence 
of 
consultations and 
i~ormed~ommunity 
agreement, 
and 
expected adverse socio-economic 
impacts, 
if 
any. 
IDA 
advises the 
Borrower 
whether 
a Resettlement 
Action 
Plan 
(RAP) 
is 
required 
for 
that 
site, 
and 
further 
action 
must 
be 
taken 
to 
ensure 
and 
demonstrate 
full 
community 
consensus, 
or 
whether 
approval 
is 
then 
dependent 
on 
IDA’S 
approval 
of 
the 
RAP. 
Wastewater 
Treatment, Wastewater 
Reuse 
and 
Sludge Reuse 
The 
operations 
and functioning 
of 
the 
WWTP 
should be 
modified 
and 
improved 
as 
a 
separate endeavor, 
so 
as 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
effluent 
does 
not 
pose a 
public 
health 
risk, 
nor 
pollute 
the 
aquifer. 
Mitigation 
requires 
major 
upgrading 
of 
the 
WWTP, 
including 
the 
construction 
of 
primary 
sedimentation 
tanks 
and 
a 
holding 
lagoon 
in 
which 
to 
store 
excess 
flows 
until 
it 
can 
be 
treated 
in 
the 
plant. 
Operatives 
in 
the 
WWTP 
and 
sludge reuse 
facilities should be 
provided 
with 
protective 
clothing 
and 
given 
adequate 
safety 
training 
by 
the 
Sana’a 
Local 
Corporation. 
The 
irrigation 
system 
should be 
improved 
by 
providing 
a 
balancing lagoon 
and 
improved 
distribution 
system. 
In 
addition,  a sludge 
drying 
and 
reuse system 
should 
be developed 
for 
reuse 
as 
a 
soil 
conditioner. 
The 
chemical and 
biological quality 
of 
wastewater 
and 
sludge 
that 
is 
to 
be 
reused 
should 
be regularly 
tested 
by 
the 
Sana’a 
Local 
Corporation 
to 
ensure 
that 
it 
does 
not 
pose a 
threat 
to 
public 
health. 
NWRA 
Sana’a 
Branch should 
also 
carry out 
spot checks 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
WHO 
standards. 
A 
detailed 
study 
should be 
conducted 
to 
determine the 
best 
technical 
solutions 
and 
costs 
of 
these 
improvements. 
Implementation 
of 
the 
SBWM 
Project should be 
contingent 
on 
satisfactory 
parallel 
implementation 
of 
WWTP 
improvements. 
Pest 
Control 
and 
Pesticides 
Management 
The 
excessive 
and  improper 
use 
of 
pesticides 
and 
fertilizers 
would 
be 
mitigated 
through 
the 
demonstration 
of 
a 
model 
integrated 
pest 
management 
(IPM) 
plan 
in 
the 
project 
areas 
for 
the 
cultivation 
of 
grape. 
This 
would 
serve 
as 
a component 
of 
the 
farmer education 
initiative 
which would 
include 
“field 
days” 
and 
a 
mobile 
workshop 
which would 
stress 
good 
and 
safe 
practice 
for 
pesticides 
application 
and 
storage 
in 
the 
field. 
In 
addition, 
regular testing 
for 
pesticides residue 
would 
take place. 
These 
activities 
would 
be 
undertaken 
by 
the 
MAI 
DPP 
over a 
two-year period. 
Details 
of 
the 
IPM 
Plan 
are 
available 
in 
the 
project file. 
In 
addition, 
an 
IPM 
for 
qat 
would 
be 
prepared 
within 
six 
months 
of 
project 
effectiveness. 
Awareness 
and 
Education 
A 
number 
of 
awareness 
building, 
training 
and education 
initiatives 
are 
proposed 
in 
the 
project 
and 
described 
elsewhere. 
General 
messages 
and 
information 
regarding 
environmental 
mitigation 
measures are 
integrated 
within 
the communication 
strategy. 
Health 
and 
hygiene education 
is 
an 
important 
aspect 
of 
reducing 
the 
risks 
of 
malaria  and bilharzia. 
The 
costs 
are 
included 
in 
the 
awareness 
and 
education 
campaign 
budgets.

Short-Term 
Construction 
Risks 
The 
short-term 
environmental 
pollution 
risks 
associated 
with 
the construction 
phase 
of 
the 
project 
would 
be 
mitigated 
through 
a 
number 
of 
measures, 
most 
of 
which 
would 
be 
stipulated 
in 
the 
terms 
of 
contract 
with 
the 
building 
contractor. 
These 
would 
include 
control 
of 
oil 
and 
diesel 
spillages, 
control 
of 
quarrying, 
dust 
suppression, 
construction 
of 
access 
roads and 
reporting 
of 
“chance 
finds” 
of 
artifacts 
of 
archeological  importance. 
Compliance 
with 
these 
measures 
would 
be 
the 
responsibility 
of 
TS-SBC 
which 
would 
supervise the works. 
Non-compliance 
would 
be 
penalized 
through 
invocation 
of 
penalty 
clauses. 
During 
the 
construction 
of 
the works,  water 
quality 
safeguards 
should 
ensure 
that 
vehicle 
fueling 
and 
maintenance 
areas are 
bounded 
and 
located at 
least 
100 
m 
from 
watercourses, 
or 
recharge 
areas. 
The 
contractor(s) 
would 
progressively rehabilitate 
the 
work 
areas 
to 
ensure 
that 
disturbed 
sites, 
which 
are 
susceptible 
to 
erosion, 
would 
not 
remain 
exposed for 
long 
periods. 
To 
the extent 
possible, 
the 
work 
should 
not 
be 
carried 
out 
during 
the 
rainy 
season(s). 
The 
borrow 
pits 
or 
quarries 
would 
be carefully 
designated 
by 
the 
environmental 
specialist 
of 
TS-SBC 
to 
cause 
the  least 
possible 
impacts. 
The 
construction 
of 
temporary 
roads 
to 
reach the 
dam 
sites 
may 
cause 
disruption of 
some 
cultivated 
lands 
and 
terraces 
and 
must 
be carefully routed 
in 
consultation 
with 
the 
local 
community and 
then 
be 
regularly 
watered 
to 
suppress 
dust. 
Noise 
and 
dust 
would 
affect 
communities 
adjacent 
to 
construction 
sites, 
particularly when 
heavy 
equipment 
is 
in 
use 
and the contractor 
would 
be 
required 
to 
maintain 
it 
in 
good 
order 
and 
use 
silencing 
and 
dust 
suppression 
measures, 
when 
appropriate. 
The health 
and 
safety 
of 
the 
work 
force 
would 
be 
protected 
as 
part 
of 
the 
contractual 
arrangements. 
This 
would 
include the 
provision 
of 
safe 
water 
supply 
and 
appropriate 
sanitation at 
the campsite. Awareness 
raising 
and other 
safety 
measures 
would 
be 
introduced 
to 
eliminate 
or 
prevent the 
risks 
of 
injuries 
due 
to 
accidents. 
Public Consultation Mechanism 
As 
an 
extension 
of 
the 
public 
disclosure 
principle 
and 
practice throughout 
the 
project 
implementation 
process, 
a 
point 
of 
contact 
would 
be 
maintained 
in 
the 
field 
to 
which 
the 
public 
may 
refer 
for 
information 
or 
lodge any 
grievance 
or 
concerns. 
The 
public 
consultation 
mechanism 
would 
be 
maintained 
by 
the 
NWWSB 
or 
TS-SBC 
throughout the 
life 
of 
the project. 
Institution 
Building 
and 
Capacity 
Building 
As 
part 
of 
the 
EMP, 
a 
number 
of 
institutional 
and 
capacity 
building 
initiatives 
are 
required 
and 
would 
be 
developed 
by 
TS-SBC 
with 
the 
concerned 
institutions 
and 
with 
the 
farmers 
in 
the 
pilot 
areas. 
These 
include: 
(i) 
building 
the capacity 
of 
the 
NWRA 
Sana’a 
Branch; 
(ii) 
assisting the 
MAVDPP 
in 
developing 
the pesticides residue 
testing 
facilities; 
(iii) 
assisting 
the 
MPH 
Bilhazia 
and 
Malaria 
Eradication 
Units 
in 
developing methodology 
for 
systematic 
monitoring 
and 
testing 
for 
the 
presence 
of 
vectors, 
and 
designing 
appropriate 
control 
dosage 
rates 
of 
insecticides 
and 
molluscicides; 
and 
(iv) 
strengthening 
the 
EPA 
in 
its 
regulation 
and 
enforcement 
responsibilities. 
Environmental 
Resource 
Team 
and 
Chance 
Finds 
An 
Environmental Specialist 
would 
be placed 
in 
TS-SBC 
to 
monitor 
and 
oversee 
the

EL4 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
Recommendations 
from 
the 
EL4 
carried out 
during 
project preparation 
are 
available 
in 
the 
project file. 
Conditionality 
A 
major 
recommendation 
is 
that 
the 
project should 
proceed 
subject 
to 
certain conditions 
being 
met. 
First, 
a general 
commitment 
by 
GOY 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
EMP 
and, 
in 
particular, 
the 
enactment 
of 
the 
Water 
Law 
and 
the 
early 
issuance 
of 
the 
bylaws 
that make 
it 
operational. 
Regulation 
and 
enforcement 
- 
64 
- 
Page  69
are 
an 
essential element 
of 
the 
EMP, 
without 
which 
it 
cannot 
be 
implemented. 
A 
commitment 
to 
the 
improvement 
of 
the 
WWTP 
to 
ensure adequate 
quality 
of 
the 
effluent 
to 
mitigate 
against 
any 
public 
health 
risk 
and 
aquifer 
pollution 
is 
a 
condition 
for 
Disbursements 
for 
the 
Supply 
Management 
Component. 
Tender 
Documents and 
Conditions 
of 
Contracts 
It 
is 
essential 
that 
environmental  conditions 
are 
included 
in 
any 
tender documents and 
conditions 
of 
contract 
for 
any 
construction  works. 
These 
would 
include 
instructions 
to 
the 
contractor  regarding 
environmental 
mitigation 
measures 
to 
be 
observed 
during 
construction 
and 
processes 
to 
be 
followed 
in 
case 
of 
any 
“chance 
fmds” 
of 
any 
artifacts 
or 
rare 
species 
of 
flora or 
forna 
are 
found. 
Environmental 
Resource 
Team 
An 
Environmental 
Specialist 
would 
be placed 
in 
the 
TS-SBC 
to 
monitor 
the 
EMP. 
Plus 
a 
local 
resource 
team 
would 
be 
identified 
that can 
be called 
upon 
from 
time 
to 
time 
in 
the event 
that any artifacts 
or 
rare 
species 
of 
flora or 
forna 
are 
found. 
The 
team 
would 
consist 
of 
a 
biodiversity 
and 
heritage 
specialist 
who 
could 
then 
readily 
make 
assessments 
regarding 
the 
significance 
of 
any 
such 
findings. 
Coordination 
of 
Communications 
A 
number 
of 
communication 
interventions 
are 
planned 
within 
the  project, 
which 
include 
public 
awareness, 
farmer education, pesticides management 
and 
health 
and 
hygiene 
education. 
These 
should 
be 
well 
coordinated 
so 
as 
to 
ensure 
consistent 
messages 
and 
in 
order 
to 
share 
resources. 
In 
addition, 
these 
should 
be 
integrated, whenever possible, 
into 
the 
existing 
extension 
services 
and 
designed 
so 
that 
they 
can 
be institutionalized 
after the projects 
completion. 
Urban 
Water 
Supply Demand 
Management 
The project 
goes 
some 
way 
in 
addressing the 
water 
resource management issues 
in 
the 
rural 
areas 
of 
the 
Sana’a 
Basin 
which 
has 
an 
indirect 
effect 
on 
urban water 
supplies. 
It 
is 
recommended that 
a 
more 
proactive 
approach 
is 
taken 
toward 
demand management 
in 
the 
city 
of 
Sana’a. 
A 
number 
of 
urban 
demand management 
measures 
can 
be 
utilized 
through 
water 
pricing,  leak detection and 
repair. 
These 
measures, 
although 
beyond 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
proposed project, 
should 
be 
introduced 
in 
the 
parallel 
urban 
projects. 
In 
addition, 
provision 
should be 
made 
at 
the 
WWTP 
to 
dispose 
of 
septic 
tank 
wastes 
carried 
by 
vacuum 
tankers. 
Flexibility 
Given 
the 
limited 
knowledge 
of 
the complex water 
management 
situation 
in 
the 
basin 
in 
the 
initial 
stage, 
enough 
flexibility 
should be 
allowed 
in 
the 
early 
stages 
of 
project 
implementation 
to 
readjust the 
project 
strategies, 
scope 
and 
procedures 
as 
more 
knowledge 
is 
gained 
through 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation.

Project 
Manapement 
and 
Monitoring 
As 
previously 
indicated, 
the 
favored project 
management 
approach 
maximizes implementation through 
contracts 
for 
execution 
of 
project 
tasks. 
This 
leads 
to 
formulation 
of 
a 
TS-SBC 
whose 
role 
is 
one 
of 
overall 
project 
oversight, 
direction,  coordination,  review, 
procurement, 
administration 
and 
monitoring 
rather 
than 
of direct implementation.  The 
result 
is 
a 
quite 
compact 
unit 
that 
would, 
however, 
need 
to 
be 
- 
65 
- 
Page  70
staffed 
by 
well-qualified 
and motivated 
professionals 
who 
are 
specialized 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
relevance 
to 
the 
project. 
For 
the 
management, 
direction, 
coordination 
and 
review 
functions, 
the 
required 
specialization 
areas 
are: 
(a) 
project 
management 
and 
public 
information; 
(b) 
engineering and 
water resource 
management; 
and 
(c) 
institutional 
and 
social 
development. 
For 
the 
procurement, 
administration 
and 
monitoring 
functions they 
are:(i) 
procurement 
and 
contract 
management; 
(ii) 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation; 
(iii) 
financial 
management 
and 
accounting; 
and 
(iv) 
office 
administration. 
To 
cover 
these 
areas, 
provision 
is 
made 
for 
a 
full-time 
TS-SBC 
core 
team 
of 
seven 
local 
professionals. 
A 
water  resourcelengineering 
specialist 
would 
be 
TS-SBC's 
director. 
A 
small 
complement 
of 
full-time local 
core 
support staff, 
for 
secretarial 
functions, 
driving 
and 
guard 
duties, 
is 
also 
provided 
for. 
An 
individual 
long-term 
local 
consultant 
is 
to 
be 
engaged 
to 
coordinate 
and 
oversee 
the  project's 
environmental 
monitoring 
activities 
within 
TS-SBC. 
Essential 
short-term 
TA 
to 
TS-SBC 
by 
wellqualified 
regional 
or 
international 
consultant 
is 
also 
provided 
for. 
It 
is 
envisaged 
that 
these 
inputs 
would 
be 
directed 
primarily 
at 
assistance 
with 
set 
up 
and 
implementation 
of 
project 
management 
and 
supervision 
procedures,  procurement 
of 
implementation 
consultants 
and 
contractors, 
timely 
technical 
reviews, 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
processes 
and 
outputs. 
For 
the 
MAYGDI 
project implementation 
units, 
the 
principal 
required 
specialization 
areas 
are 
imgation 
engineering, 
dams 
engineering 
and 
social 
mobilization, 
plus 
all 
aspects 
of 
training 
and 
extension 
related 
to 
these. 
Consequently, a 
project 
allowance 
is 
made 
for 
three 
local 
professionals 
to 
cover 
these 
areas. 
The 
estimated 
overall 
baseline 
cost 
for 
these 
project 
management 
and 
monitoring 
inputs 
is 
US$2,275,000. 
In 
accordance 
with 
the 
planned institutional 
evolution 
over 
the 
course 
of 
the project, 
the 
TS-SBC 
may, 
during 
the last 
few 
years 
of 
the project, 
be 
transformed 
or 
incorporated 
into 
and 
assume 
the 
duties 
and 
tasks 
of 
the 
Sana'a 
Basin 
Agency, 
if 
such 
an 
agency was 
to 
be 
created. 
The 
agency 
would 
then 
function 
as 
coordinator 
for 
Phase 
I 
project 
implementation. 
It 
would 
expand, 
as 
necessary, 
to 
allow 
it 
to 
implement 
and 
supervise 
Phase 
II 
operations 
of 
the 
APL.

Additional 
benefits, 
although 
not 
specifically 
stated 
in

objectives, 
are 
an 
increase 
in

Groundwater mining

Increasing 
the 
useful 
lfe 
of 
groundwater 
resources 
in 
the 
Sana 
'a 
Basin 
is 
the 
primary 
objective 
of 
the 
program, 
of 
which 
the 
proposed 
project 
is 
the 
first 
phase. 
Accordingly, 
the 
project 
will: 
(a) 
improve 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
water 
balance 
and 
usable groundwater 
storage; 
and 
(b) 
test a 
combination 
of 
technical, 
financial, 
regulatory 
and 
institutional 
instruments 
aimed 
at 
increasing the 
availability 
of 
water 
(supply 
management) 
and 
decreasing 
its 
demand (demand 
management). Subsequent phases 
of 
the 
program 
will 
be 
designed 
based 
on 
the 
findings 
of 
the 
first 
phase, 
allowing 
a 
better understanding 
of 
the 
resource 
and 
of 
the 
measures 
to 
be 
implemented 
to 
best reduce 
the 
rate 
of 
aquifer 
depletion. 
A 
strong 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
system 
will 
be 
set-up 
as 
part 
of 
project 
activities.

Given 
current 
knowledge 
of 
the 
hydrogeology, 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
quantify 
by 
how 
much 
the 
project 
would 
extend 
the useful 
life 
of 
groundwater  resources. Indeed, 
the 
groundwater 
imbalance 
and the 
exploitable 
groundwater 
storage 
are 
fraught 
with 
high 
degree 
of 
uncertainties; 
and 
the 
overall 
effect 
of 
project 
interventions 
on 
the 
aquifer 
system 
is 
to 
a 
large 
extent 
unknown. 
A 
more direct way 
of 
estimating 
project 
benefits 
was 
used consisting 
of 
aggregating, 
at the 
level 
of 
the 
basin, expected 
Net 
Water 
Savings 
(NWS) 
and estimating their 
economic value 
according 
to 
their 
expected 
future 
use. 
NWS 
are 
expected 
from 
a 
decrease 
in 
the 
non-beneficial 
use 
of 
water 
(i.e., 
evaporation) 
while 
limiting 
growth 
in 
beneficial 
use 
(i.e., 
water 
absorbed 
by 
the 
crops), 
In 
practice, 
it 
entails increasing 
the 
irrigation 
efficiency 
through 
the  dissemination 
of 
improved irrigation 
techniques 
and 
enhancing groundwater 
recharge 
from 
surface 
run-off 
through 
the 
construction 
and 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
dams, 
while 
preventing 
irrigation 
expansion. 
NWS 
have 
been 
quantified 
for two 
components, 
namely 
the 
irrigation 
improvement 
component 
(40% 
of 
project 
costs) 
and 
the 
groundwater 
recharge component 
(30% 
of 
project 
costs). 
NWS 
are 
expected 
to 
reach 
about 
8 
MCMfyear 
at 
full 
development 
or 
about 
5% 
of 
current 
annual 
consumptive 
use 
and 
6% 
of 
current 
annual 
groundwater 
mining 
in 
the 
Sana'a 
Basin. 
Assuming 
a constant 
mining 
of 
the 
aquifer over 
time 
(129 
MCWyear), 
the 
project 
would 
extend the 
useful 
life 
of 
the 
aquifer 
by 
5%.

It 
should 
be 
noted 
that  the 
public 
awareness 
campaign 
(5% 
of 
project 
costs) 
and 
the 
legal 
and 
institutional 
development 
components 
(15% 
of 
project 
costs) 
are 
critical 
to 
achieve 
these 
savings 
by 
helping contain irrigation 
expansion and 
by 
encouraging 
the  adoption 
of 
improved 
technology 
and 
management 
systems, 
including 
the proper 
O&M 
of 
infrastructure. 
Additional 
NWS 
from 
the 
public 
awareness 
campaign and the 
legal 
and 
institutional framework 
were 
not 
quantified. 
They 
could 
be 
substantial, 
however, 
as 
their 
scope 
is 
not 
limited to 
the 
areas 
covered 
by 
project's 
physical 
investments, 
but 
includes the entire 
Sana'a 
Basin 
and 
concerns 
all 
water 
uses 
(not 
only 
irrigation). 
As 
more 
awareness 
of 
water 
scarcity 
in 
the 
basin 
is 
achieved 
and 
a 
proper 
regulatory 
system 
is 
in 
place, 
subsequent 
increased 
willingness 
and 
improved 
capacity 
of 
local 
communities and 
GOY 
to 
counter the 
depletion 
of 
the aquifers 
would 
be 
facilitated.

conducted 
during

it 
was 
possible 
to

what

process. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
about 
4,000

from

(30%

It 
is 
important 
to 
note 
that 
these 
savings 
will 
materialize 
only 
if 
the 
infrastructure 
is 
properly 
maintained. 
It 
is 
indeed 
critical 
that 
the 
silt 
is 
removed annually 
as 
part 
of 
the 
O&M 
works 
of 
the 
dam 
so 
that 
groundwater 
recharge 
potential 
is 
sustained. 
The  public 
awareness 
campaign 
and 
the 
legal 
and 
institutional 
development 
component 
will 
help 
meet 
these 
conditions. 
It 
is 
also 
important 
to 
realize that 
recharge 
is 
only 
one 
of 
the 
objectivelbenefit 
of 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
the 
existing

preventing 
potential 
socio-economic 
damage 
downstream 
is 
another 
important 
benefit. 
(iii) 
Valuation 
of 
the 
water savings 
The methodology 
proposed 
consists 
of: 
(a) 
estimating 
the amounts 
of 
the 
NWS 
that 
would 
be 
used 
in 
the 
M&I 
and 
agricultural 
sectors 
respectively; 
and 
(b) 
measuring 
the value 
of 
water 
in 
these 
two 
sectors. 
Only 
the user 
value 
of 
water was calculated. 
The 
scarcity value that 
will 
increase 
over 
time 
has 
not 
been 
quantified. 
The 
base-case 
scenario 
assumes 
that 
the 
allocation 
of 
the 
NWS 
between 
the 
M&I 
and 
irrigation 
sectors 
follows 
the current 
and 
expected 
allocation of 
overall 
water 
resources 
between 
these 
two 
sectors 
in 
the 
basin. 
Two 
other 
scenarios 
were considered 
(see 
the 
sensitivity 
analysis), 
in 
which 
100% 
of 
the 
NWS 
is 
used 
in 
irrigation 
and 
100% 
is 
used 
in 
for 
M&I 
use. 
The actual 
allocation 
being 
somewhere 
between 
these 
two 
extremes. 
In 
the 
base-case 
scenario, 
the 
share 
of 
water allocated 
to 
M&I 
as 
well 
as 
the value 
of 
water 
increase 
over 
time. 
The 
current 
gross 
M&I 
water 
use 
is 
about  38 
MCMlyear 
(31 
MCM 
for 
municipal 
use 
in 
urban 
areas, 
3 
MCM 
for 
domestic 
use 
in 
rural 
areas 
and 
4 
MCM 
for 
industrial 
use) 
of 
which 
80% 
returns 
to 
the aquifer. 
Hence, 
consumptive 
use 
in 
M&I 
is 
about 
7 
MCMlyear. 
Current 
net 
water 
use 
in 
irrigation 
is 
estimated 
at 
about 
154 
MCM 
(with 
an 
average 
retum 
flow 
of 
20%). 
The 
irrigation 
sector accounts for 
96% 
of 
consumptive 
use 
in 
the 
basin, 
the 
M&I 
sector 
4%. 
It 
is 
assumed 
that 
water 
use 
in 
irrigation 
and 
domestic 
use 
in 
rural 
areas 
would 
remain 
constant 
over 
time. 
Industrial 
water 
use 
would 
increase 
by 
2% 
pea. 
between 
2003 
and 
2013, 
and 
1% 
p.a. 
between 
2013 
and 
2023. 
While municipal 
water 
use 
in 
the 
urban 
area 
will 
increase 
as 
a 
result 
of 
population growth 
(6% 
p,a, 
between 
2003-13 
and 
5% 
thereafter) 
and 
increase 
in 
the 
average  use 
per 
capita 
(2% 
p.a. 
between 
20 
13-2023 
and 
1 
% 
thereafter). 
The 
economic value 
of 
water 
in 
agriculture 
is 
estimated 
using 
the 
residual 
imputation 
method 
(the 
value 
added 
of 
water 
is 
calculated 
on 
the 
basis of 
farm 
budgets 
and 
average 
cropping 
pattern 
in 
the 
project 
area). 
The 
average 
cropping pattern 
has 
been estimated 
by 
Satellite 
Data 
Analysis 
(Sana’a 
Basin 
- 
Satellite 
Data 
Analysis of Cropping 
and 
Irrigation 
Water Use 
- 
Final 
Report 
- 
November 2001 
- 
ITC 
- 
ME 
Delft) 
and 
is 
assumed 
to 
remain 
constant 
over 
time. 
Qat 
is 
the 
main 
crop 
covering 
about 47% 
of 
the 
irrigated 
area, 
followed 
by 
grape 
(35%), 
mixed 
cereals 
and 
vegetables 
(16%) 
and 
fruit 
trees 
(2%). 
Qat 
is 
by 
far, the 
most profitable 
crop 
in 
the basin 
and 
cannot 
be 
excluded 
from 
the 
project.  Under 
current 
price 
structure,  qat 
is 
financially  viable 
even 
when the 
water  table 
is 
deeper 
than 
800 
meters, 
whereas 
vegetable 
and 
fruit 
trees 
becomes 
unviable 
at 
about 300-400 meters. 
Farm 
budgets have been 
prepared 
for 
these 
crops  based 
on 
a representative  sample 
of 
farms 
in 
the 
project 
area. 
It 
was  assumed 
that 
agricultural 
practices and 
input 
and output 
prices 
would 
remain 
constant, 
except 
for 
pumping 
costs. 
Pumping 
cost 
is 
increasing 
over 
time 
as 
the 
depth of 
the water  table 
increases 
by 
an 
average 
of 
4 
meterslyear. 
Detailed 
farm budgets 
and 
the 
calculation 
of 
economic 
prices 
are 
available 
in 
the 
project 
files. 
Based 
on 
these assumptions, 
the 
average 
economic value 
added 
of 
consumutive water used 
in 
irrigation 
is 
estimated 
at 
0.26 
US$/& 
in 
2003 (assuming a 
20% 
retum 
flow). 
The 
economic 
value 
for 
municipal 
use 
was 
estimated 
using 
the revealed preference 
method 
(based 
on 
actual prices 
paid 
to 
consumers 
to 
private 
tankers 
(on 
average 
US1.2$/m3) 
as 
no 
WTP 
is 
available. 
Considering 
an 
average 
return 
flow 
of 
80%, 
a 
production 
cost 
of 
US$0.3/d 
and 
a wastewater treatment 
- 
72 
- 
Page  77
of 
US$0.47/m3, 
the economic 
value 
of 
consumptive 
water 
for 
municipal 
use 
is

In 
addition 
to 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
11 
dams, 
the 
project 
will 
strengthen 
nonstructural 
dam 
safety 
measures 
such 
as 
monitoring 
of 
the 
dam 
safety, 
O&M 
of 
the 
dams 
and 
the development 
of 
emergency preparedness 
plans. 
Benefits 
from 
this 
component were 
not 
valued 
as:  (a) 
no 
quantitative 
estimate 
is 
available 
on 
potential property 
damage; 
and 
(b) 
no

it 
is 
clear 
that 
the

would 
pose serious threats

A 
scale 
from 
0 
to 
10 
has 
been 
assumed 
for 
the 
risk 
assessment 
: 
zero 
being 
the lowest

and

the

3. 
Agricultural 
benefits. 
In 
addition 
to 
saving 
water, 
irrigation 
improvement 
has a 
positive 
impact 
on 
farmer 
revenues 
as 
crop 
yields 
and 
produce 
quality 
improve, and 
labor 
and 
pumping 
costs 
decrease. 
At 
full 
development, 
yield 
increases are 
expected 
to 
range 
from 
2 
to 
4% 
and 
the 
reduction 
in 
the 
volume 
of 
water 
pumped 
from 
18 
to 
36% 
depending 
on 
the 
type 
of 
irrigation 
improvement 
considered. 
Additional 
yield 
increases 
from 
the extension 
services 
were 
not 
quantified, 
nor 
were 
the 
potential 
improvements 
in 
the 
quality 
of 
agricultural 
products 
valued. 
4. 
Economic 
rate 
of 
return and 
sensitivity 
analysis. 
The 
economic 
internal 
rate 
of 
return 
(EIRR) 
and 
Net 
Present 
Value 
(NPV) 
were calculated 
for 
the 
overall project 
and 
for 
the 
irrigation 
improvement and 
groundwater recharge enhancement 
components, 
respectively. 
Project 
benefits were 
calculated 
based 
on 
the assumptions presented 
above. 
Project 
costs 
were 
derived 
from 
the 
software 
COSTAB. 
No 
shadow 
pricing 
for 
foreign 
exchange 
was 
performed, since 
the 
official 
exchange 
rate 
broadly reflect 
the 
equilibrium 
exchange 
rate. 
The 
base 
case 
scenario 
indicates the 
following 
rates 
of 
return: 
17% 
for 
the 
-

overall 
project, 
42% 
for 
the 
irrigation 
improvement 
component alone 
and 
0% 
for 
the 
enhanced recharge 
component alone. 
The negligible 
rate 
of 
retum 
of 
the 
supply 
management component 
is 
explained 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
two 
of 
its 
major 
benefits 
were 
not 
quantified, 
namely, the 
decrease 
in 
the 
potential 
damage 
of 
socio-economic infrastructure downstream 
as 
well 
as 
beneficiary 
participation 
in 
water 
resource 
management.

in

to

(a) 
to

of 
the three 
major 
activities 
proposed 
under 
the

A 
total 
of 
six 
well 
models  were 
constructed 
to 
capture 
the 
three 
major 
irrigation 
improvements 
considered 
at 
two 
different 
water 
depths 
(150 
and 
300 
meters). 
Quantified 
benefits 
from 
irrigation 
improvements were 
assumed 
to 
be: 
(a) 
savings 
in 
pumping 
costs 
(both capital 
and 
O&M) 
as 
a 
result 
of 
improved irrigation 
efficiency; and 
(b) 
agricultural 
yield 
increases, 
as 
observed 
and 
measured 
during 
the 
implementation of 
the 
LWCP. 
Yield 
increases 
were conservatively 
assumed 
at 
2% 
for 
improvement 
of 
existing 
piped 
systems, 
3% 
for 
conversion 
of 
earth canal 
to 
piped-conveyance systems 
and 
4% 
for 
the 
introduction 
of 
modem 
on-farm 
irrigation 
systems. 
It 
is 
assumed 
that water 
devth and 
the 
irrigated 
area 
remain 
constant 
over 
time 
in 
both 
the 
“with” 
and 
“without” 
project 
scenarios. 
A 
well 
serves 
an 
average 
of 
5 
hectares 
and 
10 
households. 
Water  devth 
is 
a 
major 
factor 
in 
the 
determination 
of 
the 
financial 
attractiveness 
of 
irrigation 
improvement. 
Financial 
returns 
substantially 
increase (conversely, cost 
recovery 
period 
decreases) 
with 
the 
depth 
of 
the aquifer.

irrigation 
technology, 
are 
more 
likely 
to 
be 
successful 
in 
areas 
with 
deeper 
water tables. 
Under 
current 
price 
structures 
and 
level 
of 
groundwater 
depletion, 
on-farm 
irrigation 
improvements 
is 
only 
justified 
(from 
a 
farmer's 
point 
of view) 
where: 
(a) 
higher-value 
crops 
are 
grown; 
and 
(b) 
water depth 
is 
high. 
It 
is 
anticipated that 
as 
the water tables 
continue 
to 
drop, 
irrigation 
improvements 
will 
become 
more and more 
attractive 
(as 
long 
as 
agriculture 
remains 
financially 
viable). 
From 
a 
farmer's 
point 
of view,  the 
most 
attractive 
activity 
is 
by 
far 
the 
conversion 
of 
earth 
canals 
into 
piped 
system, 
followed 
by 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
piped-conveyance 
system. 
The 
introduction 
of 
on-farm 
modem 
irrigation 
techniques 
appears 
interesting 
on 
a 
financial 
point 
of 
view only 
when 
water 
depth 
is 
high. 
Without 
adequate subsidies, 
significant 
adoption rate 
of 
on-farm 
irrigation 
technology 
appears 
doubtful. 
Cost 
Recovery 
and 
Cost 
Sharing 
1. 
Irrigation 
imurovements: 
Capital 
cost 
sharing 
principles 
for 
irrigation 
improvements 
are 
based 
on 
those 
for 
the 
previous 
LWCP. 
However, they 
have been 
modified 
to 
reflect 
the 
key 
objectives 
of 
the 
project. Specifically, 
increased 
levels 
of 
project 
subsidies 
to 
participating 
users 
have 
been 
defined 
to: 
(a) 
accelerate 
participation 
in 
the 
first 
phase, 
thereby 
having 
a strong demonstration effect; and 
(b) 
serve 
as 
incentive 
to 
farmers 
to 
refrain 
from 
future 
use 
of 
the saved 
water 
and 
future extension 
of 
irrigated 
areas. 
The 
selected 
levels of 
beneficiaries 
contributions 
to 
capital 
costs 
are 
indicated 
in 
the 
table 
below. 
All 
O&M 
costs 
would 
be 
borne 
by 
the 
direct 
beneficiaries. 
Installation 
cost 
Water 
users' 
share 
would 
be 
paid 
in 
two 
stages: 
(a) 
a 
down-payment 
of 
YR 
20,000 
would 
be 
made 
prior 
to 
design, 
to 
ensure 
farmer's 
commitment 
to 
the 
project; 
(b) 
the 
balance 
would 
be 
paid prior  to 
installation 
of 
the 
equipment. 
Water 
user's 
would 
deposit 
their contribution 
in 
a 
special account 
at 
the 
Sana'a 
branch 
of 
the 
CACB 
which 
should 
notify 
the 
project 
and 
credit 
the 
project's 
account 
from 
the 
deposit 
as 
quickly 
as 
possible. 
It 
is 
foreseen 
that water 
users 
could 
access 
credit 
from 
CACB to 
finance 
their 
share 
of 
the investment 
cost. 
The  project 
would 
support 
this 
effort 
by 
helping 
water 
users 
in 
the 
credit 
applications 
and 
providing 
the 
bank 
with 
all 
necessary 
information 
regarding 
the proposed 
activities 
to 
be 
financed. 
However, 
the 
project 
would not 
finance 
or 
guarantee, 
in 
any 
way, 
the 
farmer's 
share 
of 
investment. 
2. 
Construction 
and 
rehabilitation of 
recharge 
dams. 
Contribution 
from 
beneficiaries to 
the 
capital 
costs 
of 
dams 
is 
not 
foreseen. 
This 
applies  also 
to 
those 
O&M 
costs 
that relate 
directly 
to 
dam 
structure 
performance and 
safety, 
as 
GDI 
would 
take 
on 
the 
responsibility 
for 
routine 
inspections 
and 
safety. 
However, 
local 
beneficiary  communities 
would 
undertake 
or 
arrange 
for: 
(a) 
dry 
season 
sediment 
removal 
from 
reservoirs 
for 
maintaining 
recharge benefits; 
and 
(b) 
upkeep 
of 
dam and reservoir 
access 
roads. 
Based 
on 
preliminary 
estimates, 
beneficiaries 
may 
contribute 
10%-20% 
of 
all 
corresponding 
O&M 
costs. 
This 
level 
will 
be revised 
based 
on 
community 
financial 
assessmentslwillingness-to-pay 
surveys 
made 
during 
the 
social 
intermediation carried out 
by 
the 
SMT 
in 
the 
early 
stage 
of 
the project.

Main 
assumptions: 
Project 
costs 
and 
financing 
rules 
are summarized 
below. 
(i) 
Beneficiaries' 
contribution 
to 
project 
costs 
(financial andlor 
in 
kind) 
totals 
about 
US$2.5 
million 
or 
about 
8% 
of 
project 
costs. 
e 
Project  beneficiaries 
(farmers) 
would 
share 
the 
costs 
of 
irrigation 
improvements, 
contributing 
between 
25 
and 
40% 
to 
the 
cost 
of 
equipment 
and 
10 
to 
20% 
to 
the design and 
installation 
costs 
depending 
on 
the type 
of 
improvement  they 
select. 
In 
addition, 
the 
beneficiaries 
will 
support the 
entire 
O&M 
costs 
of 
the 
improved 
systems, 
The 
proposed levels 
of 
cost-sharing 
are 
summarized 
in 
the 
following 
table: 
e 
Project beneficiaries 
(Was) 
would 
also 
contribute 
to 
the annual 
desilting 
cost 
of 
the 
dams 
and 
the 
maintenance 
of 
their 
access 
roads. 
A 
reasonable 
beneficiary 
contribution 
will 
be 
determined 
by 
the 
SMTs 
in 
the 
early 
stages 
of 
project 
implementation, 
through 
a 
sociallwillingness-to-pay 
survey 
during 
the 
social 
intermediation 
and 
awareness 
phase. 
Annual 
maintenance costs 
of 
the 
dams 
vary 
- 
77 
- 
Page  82
widely 
depending 
on 
the 
length 
of 
the 
access 
road 
and 
the 
siltation 
rate 
of 
the 
dam 
and 
the 
accrual 
per 
beneficiary 
family 
depends 
on 
the  size 
of 
the 
population 
downstream. 
Preliminary 
estimates 
indicate 
a 
beneficiary contribution 
of 
about 
10 
to 
20% 
of 
the 
costs 
of 
desilting 
and maintenance 
of 
the 
access 
roads. 
(ii) 
GOY 
counterpart 
finds 
would 
cover 
taxes 
and 
duties 
as 
well 
as 
the 
operating and 
maintenance costs 
not 
covered 
by 
beneficiaries. 
GOY'S 
contribution 
to 
project 
costs 
total 
about 
US$3,5 
million, 
or 
about 
12% 
of 
project 
costs. 
(iii)Finally, 
IDA 
credit 
would 
total 
US$24 
million 
or 
about 
80% 
of 
project 
costs.

improvement, 
the 
view 
of 
staff 
working 
on 
Yemen 
is 
they 
are 
not 
applied 
with 
the 
degree 
of 
commitment 
necessary 
to 
reduce 
the prevalent 
tendency 
for 
inefficient 
and uneconomic 
procurement. 
A 
CPAR 
was 
finalized  and 
issued 
in 
December 
2000. 
The 
CPAR 
has 
noted 
the  current 
legal 
framework 
for 
public 
procurement,  however, 
falls 
short 
of 
acceptable 
international 
procurement 
standards 
in 
the 
following key 
areas, 
namely: 
the 
lack 
of 
Standard 
Bid 
Documents 
(SBDs), 
gaps 
in 
the legislation, 
and 
that 
parts 
of 
even 
the 
current 
legislation 
do 
still 
conflict 
with 
Bank 
guidelines. 
Although, 
in 
the 
long 
term, 
it 
is 
considered essential that 
these 
gaps 
in 
the 
current 
legislation need 
to 
be 
addressed 
through 
a 
revised framework 
requiring 
Parliament’s  endorsement. Nonetheless, 
for 
the 
short 
term 
with 
support 
from 
an 
IDF 
grant 
for 
procurement 
reforms,  a comprehensive 
National 
Procurement 
Manual 
with 
proposed SBDs 
has 
recently 
been 
prepared 
and 
is 
currently 
under 
review 
by 
the 
Yemeni 
authorities.  Once 
approved 
and 
issued, 
as 
well 
as 
actual 
implementation 
of 
planned 
workshops 
by 
the consultants 
in 
the 
next 
few 
months, the manuals 
for 
public 
sector 
procurement 
with 
national 
application, 
are 
expected 
to 
significantly 
enhance 
the 
potential 
for 
realizing 
the 
objectives 
of 
economy 
and 
efficiency, 
as 
well 
as 
an 
increased 
level 
of 
GOY 
compliance 
with 
IDA 
guidelines.

The 
general 
absence 
of 
procurement 
planning 
in 
most 
sectors 
in 
Yemen 
has 
led to 
inefficient 
project 
implementation. 
A 
draft 
Overall 
Procurement 
Plan 
(OPP) 
for 
goods 
and 
equipment, 
works  and 
consultant 
services 
has 
been 
reviewed 
and 
finalized 
at  negotiations. 
In 
addition, 
prior to 
Board 
presentation, a 
Detailed 
Procurement 
Plan 
(DPP) 
indicating 
the procurement 
method 
and 
processing 
time 
for 
each 
contract 
has 
been  prepared 
covering 
the 
first 
year 
of 
implementation 
(attached). 
An 
updated procurement 
plan 
will 
be submitted 
to 
IDA 
for 
review 
during 
every 
supervision 
mission. 
The 
progress

Procurement 
Implementation 
Arrangements. 
A 
Project 
Steering 
Committee 
has 
been 
set 
up, 
chaired 
by 
the 
MOPD, 
with 
representatives 
from 
NWRA, 
NWSA, 
MAI 
and 
ACU. 
This 
committee 
would 
oversee 
project 
preparation  and 
implementation 
(Phase 
I 
of  the 
AF'C), 
as 
well 
as 
the 
finalization 
of 
the 
basin 
management plan. 
A 
TS-SBC 
set 
up 
to 
manage 
the 
proposed 
project 
will 
also have 
the 
responsibility 
to 
out 
procurement 
aspects 
of 
the proposed 
operation, 
The 
establishment 
and 
staffing 
of 
the  TS-SBC 
would 
be 
a 
Condition 
of 
Effectiveness. 
The 
TS-SBC 
would 
have 
operating 
authority, 
in 
line 
with 
the 
directives 
agreed 
between 
GOY 
and 
IDA. 
Key 
responsibilities 
of 
the  TS-SBC 
would 
include  project 
preparation 
and 
implementation, 
financial 
management, 
procurement, disbursement, 
and 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
of 
CDD 
sub-projects. 
The 
TS-SBC 
is 
expected 
to 
consist 
of 
four  full-time 
professionals 
(a 
water 
resource 
specialistlhydrogeologist, 
a 
sociologist, 
procurement 
specialist 
and 
an 
accountantladministrator), 
and 
other

consultants 
as 
needed. 
Consulting 
firms 
or 
individuals 
will 
be 
contracted, 
as 
needed, 
to 
prepare 
engineering 
design, 
specification, 
and 
bidding 
documents, 
and 
also 
to 
provide  construction 
supervision, 
technical 
advice 
and 
assistance 
to 
communities 
during 
the construction 
of 
the 
CDD 
sub-projects. 
Capacity 
Assessment 
A 
formal 
procurement capacity 
assessment 
of 
the 
TS-SBC, 
which 
remains 
to 
be 
established, 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
prior 
to 
Credit 
Effectiveness 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Procurement Services 
Policy 
Group 
(OPCPR) 
Guidelines 
dated 
July 
15,2002. 
The 
project 
is 
considered 
high 
risk 
since the 
TS-SBC 
will 
be 
in 
constant dialogue 
with 
a 
number 
of 
stakeholders spread 
over 
key 
ministries. 
The 
assessment 
will 
outline 
the 
main 
issues 
and 
recommendations, 
and 
an 
action 
plan 
will 
also 
be prepared 
and 
agreed 
upon 
with 
the SBC 
which 
will 
focus 
on: 
(a) 
establishing 
procurement 
capacity 
in 
the TS-SBC 
through 
timely 
recruitment 
of 
one 
or 
perhaps 
two 
procurement 
specialists, 
provision 
of 
adequate 
training,  guidance 
and 
external  technical  audits  specific 
to 
procurement  (model 
TORS 
for 
the 
procurement 
specialists 
would 
be 
shared 
with 
TS-SBC  at 
negotiations) 
by 
consultants; 
and 
(b) 
logistical 
and 
material 
support 
for 
proper 
filing 
of 
procurement documentation 
where 
required. 
An 
Action 
Plan 
will 
also 
be 
developed 
and 
agreed 
upon 
for 
community-based 
procurement 
activities 
at 
the 
district 
and 
local 
levels 
using 
the 
Bank's 
Fiduciary 
Management 
for 
CDD 
projects 
of 
May 
2000 
as 
a 
reference 
guide. 
In 
particular,  adoption 
of 
Project Implementation 
Manual 
(PIM) 
in 
which 
simplified 
procurement 
processes 
for  sub-project proposals 
from 
community-based  groups 
is 
made 
part 
of 
the 
PIM, 
and 
determined satisfactory 
to 
IDA 
will 
be 
a 
condition 
of 
Effectiveness. 
In 
the 
interim, 
pending 
the scheduled 
capacity 
assessment 
of 
TS-SBC, 
the 
prior 
review 
thresholds 
in 
the 
DCA 
have been 
set 
on 
the basis 
of 
the 
risk 
profile 
(high) 
of 
a 
similar 
project 
in 
Yemen's 
water 
sector, 
the 
Irrigation 
Improvement Project 
(P062714).

Summarv 
The 
SBC  that 
has 
been  established 
will 
have 
the 
project 
management 
and 
implementation 
responsibilities 
including 
FM. 
To 
facilitate 
the 
implementation 
process, 
a 
TS-SBC 
will 
be 
created 
within 
the 
SBC 
to 
undertake the 
project 
implementation. 
The 
TS-SBC 
will 
also 
be 
entrusted 
with 
the 
project 
FM 
and 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
maintaining 
all 
financial 
and 
accounting 
records, 
preparing 
accounting 
entries, 
reviewing 
and 
posting, 
preparing 
monthly 
bank reconciliation, 
as 
well 
as 
manage 
all 
disbursements 
from 
IDA 
funds. 
Also, 
the 
TS-SBC 
will 
prepare semi-annual 
project financial 
monitoring 
reports 
(FMRs) 
and 
submit 
them 
un-audited 
to 
IDA 
within 
45 
days 
from 
each 
semester-end, 
and 
prepare 
the project’s 
annual 
financial 
statements 
and 
arrange 
for 
their auditing 
by 
a 
qualified 
auditor 
acceptable 
to 
the 
IDA. 
Hence, 
FM 
system 
is 
not 
yet 
established 
at 
TS-SBC, 
establishment 
of 
adequate 
FM 
system 
acceptable 
to 
IDA 
will 
be 
a 
condition 
ofeffectiveness. 
The 
main 
elements 
of 
adequate 
FM 
system 
- 
85 
- 
Page  90
are: 
(a) 
qualified 
financial officer; 
(b) 
FM 
procedural 
manual; 
(c) 
accounting 
records and 
books 
of 
accounts; 
(d) 
appointment 
of 
qualified 
independent  auditor; 
and 
(e) 
set 
up 
of 
computerized 
accounting 
and 
reporting 
system capable 
of 
producing 
FMR. 
Completion 
of 
the 
first 
four 
components 
in 
a 
manner 
satisfactory 
to 
IDA 
would 
be 
sufficient 
to 
meet 
the 
condition 
of 
effectiveness. 
To 
expedite the 
process 
of 
establishment 
of 
adequate 
FM 
system, 
the TS-SBC 
will 
benefit 
from 
FM 
experiences 
gained 
through 
previous 
IDA-financed Rural 
Access Project, 
through 
the 
adaptation 
of 
existing 
FM 
manuals 
to 
the specific 
needs 
of 
this 
project 
by 
the 
project 
financial 
officer. 
Therefore, 
the 
appointment 
of 
qualified 
financial officer, 
which 
will 
take 
place 
shortly after 
signing 
the 
credit 
agreement 
according 
to 
TORS 
acceptable 
to 
IDA, 
is 
a 
key 
step 
toward 
having 
adequate 
FM 
system. 
According 
to 
our 
experience, adaptation 
of 
the 
FM 
manual 
of 
Rural 
Access 
Project 
to 
the 
specific 
needs 
and requirements 
of 
this 
project 
would 
take 
between 
4-6 weeks 
from 
the 
date 
of 
the 
financial 
officer's 
appointment. 
There 
are 
several 
similar 
areas 
between the 
two 
projects, 
including 
handling 
of 
disbursement procedures, 
payment 
control 
procedures, 
assets 
management, 
accounts 
reconciliation 
procedures. 
The 
computerized 
FM 
system 
will 
be 
based 
on 
local 
FM 
Software 
to 
be 
selected 
from 
the 
several 
over 
the 
shelf 
software applications available 
in 
the 
local 
market. Selection 
of 
best-fit 
FM 
software 
would 
take 
between 
4-6 
weeks, 
while 
implementation 
would 
take 
between 
6-8 
weeks (16-20 
weeks 
in 
total). 
For 
this 
purpose, the TS-SBC 
will 
appoint, 
shortly after 
signing 
the  credit, 
a 
qualified 
financial 
officer 
to 
elaborate an 
FM 
manual 
and 
set 
up 
a 
computerized accounting system 
in 
order 
to 
have 
an 
adequate 
FM 
system acceptable 
to 
IDA 
by 
no 
later 
than 
project 
effectiveness. 
The 
appointment 
will 
be 
made 
according 
to 
a 
TOR 
acceptable 
to 
IDA. 
Procurement 
of 
goods 
and 
services 
for 
all 
stakeholders 
(Le., 
WAS) 
will 
be 
made 
through 
the 
TS-SBC. 
Also, 
all 
payments 
to 
contractors 
and 
third 
parties 
will 
be 
made 
through 
the TS-SBC. 
Accounting 
Svstem 
The project 
accounting practices 
will 
follow 
generally 
accepted 
accounting  principles, 
including 
accrual 
basis 
of 
accounting 
and 
double-entry 
bookkeeping, 
which would 
be reflected 
in 
details 
in 
the 
accounting 
policies 
and 
procedures 
of 
the 
TS-SBC 
financial 
manual. 
Local 
accounting software 
will 
be 
selected 
and 
implemented 
for 
the 
project 
and 
will 
assist 
in 
generating 
semi-annual 
FMR. 
Procurement 
of 
FM 
software 
will 
follow 
IDA'S 
procurement guidelines 
on 
NS. 
The 
selection 
process 
would 
require 
4-6 weeks 
after 
the 
appointment 
of 
the 
qualified financial officer. 
The 
FM 
package 
implementation 
and testing 
process 
would 
require 
between 
10-12 
weeks. 
All 
accounts 
and supporting 
documents 
will 
be 
maintained 
at 
the TS-SBC. 
The financial 
officer 
will 
develop 
a chart 
of 
accounts 
reflecting 
all 
project 
activities, 
and enabling 
automatic generation 
of 
FMR 
and 
project 
financial 
statements. TORS 
and 
job 
descriptions 
of 
the 
financial 
officer 
and 
the 
required 
adaptation for 
the 
FM 
manual were 
agreed 
upon 
during 
negotiations.

Internal 
Control 
Procedures 
The 
FM 
manual, 
to 
be 
adapted 
by 
the project’s 
financial officer 
from 
the 
ongoing 
Rural 
Access 
Project, 
will 
define 
adequate 
internal 
control 
procedures 
and 
proper 
segregation 
of 
duties 
among 
incompatible 
functions, 
including 
dual 
check  signatories, 
preparation 
of 
monthly 
general  ledger 
closure, 
and 
preparing 
monthly 
bank 
reconciliation 
for all 
project 
bank 
accounts. 
All 
financial 
transactions 
incurred 
directly 
by 
any 
participating 
agency (ie., 
MAI) 
from 
its 
own 
resources 
should 
be 
pre-approved 
by 
TS-SBC 
and 
supporting 
documents 
should be 
sent 
to 
TS-SBC 
for 
verification 
and 
recording 
in 
the 
project’s  accounting 
records. 
Reimbursement 
of 
such expenditures 
from 
the 
Special 
Account 
(SA) 
to 
the 
participating 
agency 
should be 
channeled 
by 
TS-SBC after 
approval 
of 
expenditures 
by 
TS-SBC. 
Basically, 
to 
facilitate 
procurement 
process 
before 
the 
start 
of 
each 
year, 
every 
participating 
agency 
will 
prepare 
and 
agree 
an 
annual 
procurement 
plan 
with 
the SBC. 
During 
Phase 
II 
and 
III, 
it 
is 
expected 
that 
MAI 
will 
manage 
the 
accounting 
and 
FM 
affairs 
and 
keep 
separate 
accounting 
records 
for 
the 
project, 
and 
thus 
would 
have 
qualified financial officer 
and 
procurement 
staff 
on 
board. 
The 
proposed 
project 
includes 
TA 
to 
MAI 
for 
capacity 
building 
and strengthening the 
ministry’s 
FM 
systems 
and 
training 
of 
finance 
staff, 
in 
view 
of 
enabling 
MAI 
to 
undertake 
the 
implementation of 
the second 
and 
third 
phases 
of 
the project, 
including 
the 
FM 
and 
procurement 
functions. 
Flow 
of 
Funds 
An 
SA 
in 
US 
Dollars 
will 
be 
established 
in 
the 
CBY 
for 
IDA 
funds, 
and 
will 
be 
managed 
by 
TS-SBC 
through coordination 
with 
MOF 
and 
MOPD 
(see 
payment 
procedures below). 
Withdrawals 
from 
IDA 
funds 
will 
be 
made 
using 
traditional 
disbursement 
methods, 
including 
direct 
payments, 
payments against special commitments, reimbursements 
and 
replenishments 
to 
the 
SA 
based 
on 
the 
SOEs 
and 
full 
documentation, 
as 
required. 
Payments 
from 
the 
SA 
will 
follow 
the 
internal control 
procedures 
stipulated 
in 
the 
financial 
manual. 
Project 
financing provided 
by 
GOY’s 
contribution 
to 
the 
project 
will 
be 
made 
through 
budget 
allocation 
arranged 
by 
MOPD 
which 
will 
be 
either 
paid 
directly 
to 
the contractor 
based 
on 
request 
from 
TS-SBC, 
or 
transferred 
to 
another 
TS-SBC 
project 
account 
in 
local 
currency 
(separate 
from 
the 
US 
Dollar 
SA) 
exclusive 
for 
the 
project 
purposes, 
and 
to 
be 
established 
at 
a 
commercial 
bank 
acceptable 
to 
IDA. 
Or 
alternatively, 
a 
local 
currency 
project 
account 
may 
be 
established 
at the 
CBY 
under the 
name 
of 
TS-SBC 
for 
GOY’s 
contribution 
to 
the 
project. 
Also, 
separate 
account 
at commercial 
bank 
under 
the name 
of 
TS-SBC 
will 
be 
established 
for 
contributions received 
from 
project 
beneficiaries 
and 
WAS. 
Payment Procedures 
Payments 
to 
contractors 
and 
third 
parties 
from 
the 
SA 
will 
follow 
the 
internal 
control 
procedures 
stipulated 
in 
the 
FM 
manual, 
and 
will 
include 
the 
following 
steps: 
(i) 
The 
project financial 
officer 
ensures 
that 
all 
supporting 
payment 
documents are available, 
and verifies them 
for 
completeness 
and 
accuracy. 
The financial 
officer 
then 
prepares 
and 
signs 
a Payment 
Order 
(PO) 
and 
forwards 
it, 
along 
with 
the 
supporting 
documents, 
to 
the 
project 
manager 
for 
review 
and 
signature. 
(ii) 
The 
financial officer 
prepares 
and 
posts 
appropriate 
journal 
accounting 
entries 
in 
the 
general 
ledger 
after 
the 
Project 
Manager 
approves payment. 
(iii)The  PO 
and 
all 
supporting 
documents 
are 
then 
sent 
to 
MOPD, 
which 
verifies 
that  the 
procurement  process was 
conducted 
in 
accordance 
with 
agreed procedures 
in 
the 
Legal 
Agreement. 
MOPD 
also 
maintains 
separate 
Statements 
of 
Account 
for 
all 
projects financed 
by 
foreign 
donors. 
Accordingly, 
the amount 
of 
payment 
is 
entered 
into 
the 
related 
project

acknowledging 
that 
they 
have 
reviewed 
the

and 
are

it 
for

(v) 
The 
MOF 
then 
conducts 
its 
own 
review 
of 
the 
PO 
and supporting 
documents. 
If 
MOF 
finds 
everythmg 
to 
be 
in

they 
prepare a 
letter 
to 
the 
CBY 
authorizing them 
to 
make payment 
to 
the beneficiary. 
It 
should be noted 
that the 
CBY 
makes 
the payment 
to 
the

based 
solely 
on 
the

and 
forwards 
to 
Project 
financing provided 
by 
GOY 
(through 
budget 
allocation 
arranged 
by 
MOPD) 
will 
be 
either 
paid 
directly 
to 
the 
contractor 
based 
on 
request 
from 
TS-SBC, 
or 
transferred 
to 
a 
separate 
project 
account 
in 
local 
currency 
(separate 
from 
the 
US Dollar 
SA) that 
will 
be 
managed 
by 
TS-SBC 
and 
used exclusively 
for 
project 
purposes. 
The 
separate 
project 
account 
would 
be 
established at 
a 
commercial bank 
acceptable 
to 
IDA, 
or 
at 
the 
CBY. 
Records 
Management 
The 
management 
of 
financial 
records 
should provide 
a 
paper 
trail 
on 
which 
the 
accounting 
system 
is 
based, 
and 
verification 
of 
financial 
transactions. 
For 
each 
financial 
transaction,  a 
separate 
record 
should 
be 
created. 
Generally, records management 
should 
include: 
(i) 
clearly 
defined 
procedures 
for 
creating 
and 
maintaining 
records; 
(ii) 
adequate 
backup 
arrangements; 
(iii) 
storage 
of 
financial 
records 
under 
lock 
and 
key, 
and 
safe 
from 
environmental 
risks 
(fire 
and 
(iv) 
easy 
access 
for 
authorized personnel only. 
water 
damage); 
and 
All 
project 
documents 
will 
be maintained 
at 
the 
TS-SBC 
during 
project implementation and 
for 
one 
year 
after 
the project’s 
closing 
date. 
All 
project 
documents 
will 
be 
provided 
to 
the 
project’s auditor 
and 
to 
visiting 
IDA 
supervision 
missions. 
Financial 
Monitoring 
ReDorts 
{FMRsj 
It 
is 
envisaged 
that 
FMR 
will 
be 
produced 
semi-annually 
rather 
than 
quarterly. 
The implementation 
of 
the 
two 
main 
components 
of 
the 
project 
(demand management 
and 
supply 
management, 
$20 
million) 
represents 
items 
of 
seasonal 
nature, 
and 
quarterly 
monitoring 
reports 
seem  excessive. 
According 
to 
the nature 
of 
the 
project 
and 
discussions 
with 
stakeholders, 
FMR 
will 
be 
produced and 
sent 
to 
the 
Bank 
un-audited 
within 
45 
days 
of 
each 
semester-end (June 
and 
December). 
The 
reports 
will 
show: 
(a) 
summary progress 
report 
on 
project 
implementation; 
(b) 
cost 
per 
component 
for 
the 
quarter 
and 
cumulative; 
(c) 
costs 
incurred per 
expenditures 
type; 
and 
(d) 
procurement 
incurred 
on 
contracts 
below 
the 
stated threshold. 
The 
chart 
of 
accounts 
for 
the 
project 
will 
be 
set 
up 
to 
facilitate 
the automatic generation 
of 
the 
FMR. 
The 
contents 
and format 
were agreed 
upon 
during 
negotiations. 
In 
Phase 
II 
and 
III, 
MAI 
will 
prepare, 
on 
quarterly 
basis, 
summary 
reports 
on 
its 
project 
related 
activities showing 
all 
project 
expenditures 
incurred 
from 
all 
resources 
and 
a 
summary 
of 
physical 
progress achieved. 
These 
quarterly reports 
should be 
sent 
to 
SBC and 
IDA 
within 
30 
days 
after 
the 
end 
of 
each quarter.

Auditing 
The project 
records 
and 
accounts 
and 
financial 
statements 
(project 
balance

statement 
of 
cash 
flow, 
and 
SA 
statement), 
as 
well 
as 
government 
local 
currency 
account 
and 
beneficiaries 
contribution 
account, 
will 
be 
subject 
to 
annual audit 
under 
International 
Standards 
on 
Auditing 
by 
an 
independent 
auditor 
acceptable 
to 
IDA, 
and 
under 
TORS 
acceptable 
to 
IDA. 
The auditor 
would 
be 
appointed 
prior 
to 
project 
effectiveness. 
Prior 
written 
approval 
(“no 
objection”) 
of 
IDA 
on 
the 
auditor 
is 
mandatory. 
The 
audit 
will 
cover 
all 
sources 
of 
funds 
related 
to 
the 
project including 
IDA 
credit. 
Also, 
it 
will 
cover 
all 
expenditures 
incurred  including 
those 
under 
SOEs 
and 
their 
compliance 
with 
the 
Development 
Credit 
Agreement. 
The 
auditor 
will 
issue 
an 
opinion 
on 
the 
fairness 
of 
the 
project 
financial 
statements 
and 
a 
separate 
opinion 
on 
the 
eligibility 
of 
all 
expenditures 
incurred 
and 
claimed 
under 
SOEs. 
The 
audit 
report should be 
sent 
to 
IDA 
no 
later than 
four 
months 
of 
year-end. 
Due 
to 
project 
complex 
arrangements 
and 
new 
establishment 
of 
SBC 
and 
TS-SBC, 
the 
FM 
risk 
related 
to 
the 
project 
is 
considered 
high. 
This 
consideration 
was made 
with 
the 
recognition 
of 
no 
FM 
staff 
on 
board, 
lack 
of 
FM 
system, 
and 
inclusion 
of 
beneficiary 
contributions. 
These 
risks 
will 
be 
mitigated 
through: 
(a) 
allocation 
of 
funds 
for 
the 
FM 
system 
and 
the 
financial 
officer 
costs; 
(b) 
having 
adequate 
FM 
system 
and 
appointment 
of 
a 
qualified  financial 
officer 
as 
a 
condition 
of 
effectiveness; 
and 
(c) 
close 
project 
supervision 
by 
the 
IDA 
team 
and 
the 
FM 
specialist 
in 
the 
Country 
Office, 
which 
will 
allow 
building 
capacity 
within 
TS-SBC 
for 
proper 
implementation.  Supervision 
and missions 
for the 
following 
years 
will 
be 
determined 
based 
on 
satisfactory performance 
in 
the 
first 
year. 
Stafing 
Key 
staff 
of 
TS-SBC 
will 
be 
the 
financial 
officer 
who 
will 
report 
to 
the 
project 
manager 
and be 
responsible 
for 
all 
aspects 
of 
the 
FM 
and 
disbursement. 
Upon 
his 
start, 
the 
financial 
officer 
will 
adapt 
the 
FM 
manual 
of 
Rural 
Access Project, 
establish 
FM 
records 
(journal, 
ledger, 
filing, 
banks 
records), 
set 
up 
project 
chart 
of 
accounts, 
and 
implement computerized 
local 
accounting 
software. 
The financial 
officer 
will 
be 
trained 
by 
the 
FM 
specialist 
in 
the 
Country 
Office 
on 
IDA 
FM 
and 
disbursement, 
in 
addition 
to 
training 
from 
the accounting software 
provider. 
Readiness 
for 
Implementation 
The 
recommended 
FM 
system 
for 
the 
project 
(staffing, 
FM 
manual, 
accounting 
system, 
reporting, 
training) 
would 
be 
in 
place 
prior 
to 
credit 
effectiveness. 
In 
addition 
to 
the appointment 
of 
qualified 
independent 
auditor 
to 
the  project, 
the 
condition 
of 
effectiveness 
would 
be 
fulfilled 
upon: 
(a) 
appointment of 
qualified financial 
officer 
under 
TOR 
acceptable 
to 
IDA; 
(b) 
customization 
of 
the 
financial 
management 
manual; 
(c) 
establishment 
of 
project 
accounting 
records; 
and 
(d) 
selection and 
initial 
setup 
of 
computerized accounting 
system. 
Accordingly, 
finalization 
of 
computerized 
system 
setup, 
training 
of 
the 
financial 
officer, 
and capability 
to 
generate 
FMR 
can be 
postponed 
until 
after 
project 
effectiveness.

Resettlement Policy Framework 
REPUBLIC 
OF YEMEN: 
Sana’a 
Basin Water Management 
Project 
SANA’A 
BASIN 
WATER 
MANAGEMENT 
PROJECT 
Resettlement 
Policy 
Framework 
Project 
Description 
1. 
The 
Sana’a 
Basin 
is 
located 
in 
central highlands 
of 
Yemen 
and 
includes 
the 
Capital 
City 
Sana’a. 
The 
basin 
has 
an 
area 
of 
3,200 
km2 
and 
an 
average 
elevation 
of 
2,200 
meters above 
mean 
sea 
level. 
Current 
population 
of 
the 
basin 
is 
estimated 
at 
about 
1.5 
million, 
of 
which 
300,000 
live 
in 
the 
rural 
areas, 
and 
the 
population growth 
rate 
is 
projected 
to 
decline 
from 
the current 
6% 
to 
about 
4% 
by 
2030. 
The 
basin 
includes 
some  110,000 
hectares 
(ha) 
of 
arable 
land, 
of 
which 
about 
20,000 
ha 
are 
irrigated. 
Groundwater 
is 
the 
mejor 
source 
of 
water 
in 
the basin. 
Abstractions 
began 
to 
exceed recharge 
during 
the 
mid-1980s 
as 
a 
consequence 
of 
the 
rapid 
urban 
population 
growth 
and 
a 
sharp 
increase 
in 
water 
use 
by 
agriculture, 
encouraged 
by 
the 
introduction 
of 
tube-well 
technologies. 
The 
basin 
is 
experiencing 
a serious 
depletion 
of 
groundwater 
resources 
with 
an 
associated 
degradation 
in 
water 
quality. 
In 
addition, 
a 
new 
Waste 
Water 
Treatment  Plant 
(WWTP) 
has 
recently 
been commissioned 
to 
the 
north 
of 
Sana’a, 
its 
effluent 
could provide 
a 
valuable water 
resource 
if 
public 
health 
issues 
can 
be 
adequately 
addressed. 
2. 
To 
address 
the water scarcity 
issues, 
the Government 
and 
the 
World 
Bank 
have 
agreed 
to 
prepare 
the 
Sana’a 
Basin 
Water 
Management Program. 
The International 
Development 
Association 
(IDA) 
will 
implement 
the 
Program through 
a  15-year 
Adaptable 
Program Credit 
(APC) 
financed. 
The 
broad 
objectives 
of 
this 
proposed 
program 
are: 
(a) 
to 
increase the 
efficiency 
of 
agricultural 
water 
use 
within 
the 
Sana’a 
Basin; 
and 
(b) 
to 
accelerate 
aquifer 
recharge 
to allow for 
a gradual 
shift 
to 
a less water-based 
rural 
economy. 
The 
objectives 
of 
the 
Phase 
I, 
five-year 
pilot 
project 
of 
this 
Program 
are: 
(a) 
to 
test 
and 
develop 
demand 
and 
supply 
management methods 
on 
a 
limited 
scale, 
so 
as 
to 
apply 
them 
on 
a large-scale 
throughout 
the 
basin 
during 
the 
subsequent phases 
of 
the 
program; 
(b) 
to 
establish the regulatory, 
legal 
and 
institutional 
framework 
needed for 
more 
sustainable 
water 
resources management 
in 
the 
basin; 
and 
(c) 
to 
carry out 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
Phase 
IT 
project 
of 
the Program. 
3. 
The 
program involves many 
sub-projects, 
which 
have 
not 
been defined 
and 
detailed 
at 
this 
time, 
among 
which 
are 
physical 
works. 
In 
the 
first 
phase 
of 
this 
program, the 
rehabilitation 
of 
existing 
dams 
and 
the 
construction 
of 
five new 
dams 
are 
planned. 
It 
is 
not 
known 
at 
this 
time 
whether 
there 
will 
be 
permanent displacement 
or 
loss 
of 
assets 
among 
the 
population 
of 
owners 
and 
users, 
and 
to 
this 
end 
this 
Resettlement 
Policy 
Framework 
has  been 
developed 
to 
ensure 
that 
all 
the 
physical  works 
are 
in 
conformity 
with 
Bank 
policy. 
The 
land 
required 
for 
these 
works 
already 
lies 
either 
within 
the 
public 
domain, 
or 
will 
be 
acquired 
by 
following 
a process 
of 
expropriation and 
compensation. 
4. 
The  project’s 
design 
has 
taken 
care 
to 
avoid 
displacement,  dispossession 
and 
conflicts. 
Nonetheless,  the 
construction 
of 
new 
dams 
still 
might 
entail 
some 
unforeseen 
land 
acquisition 
and 
compensation 
issues, 
in 
which 
case 
OPlBP 
4.12 
related 
to 
Involuntary 
Resettlement 
will 
be 
triggered. 
This 
Resettlement 
Policy 
Framework 
(RPF) 
serves 
to 
show the procedures 
to 
be 
followed 
by 
GOY 
to 
compensate 
for 
assets 
taken 
or 
loss 
of 
access 
to 
livelihood 
resources, 
the 
procedures 
for 
compensation, 
and the 
measures 
to 
mitigate 
any 
negative 
impacts.

Principles 
and 
Objectives 
Governing 
Resettlement 
Preparation 
and 
Implementation 
5. 
This 
Resettlement 
Policy 
Framework 
establishes 
the 
procedures 
for 
any 
land 
acquisition 
or 
loss 
or 
restriction 
of 
access 
to 
assets, 
through expropriation 
in 
the 
public 
interest. 
It 
applies 
to 
private 
and 
communal 
lands 
or 
properties 
affected 
throughout 
the 
Sana’a 
Basin 
Water 
Management 
Project. 
In 
particular, 
it 
addresses 
how 
the 
GOY 
will 
identify, 
mitigate 
and 
compensate 
any 
adverse 
impacts 
on 
the 
assets 
and 
livelihoods 
of 
the people 
directly 
affected 
by 
possible 
expropriations. 
It 
is 
intended 
to 
safeguard the interests 
of 
the 
population 
impacted 
by 
the 
project, especially the 
poor 
and 
vulnerable. 
6. 
This 
Framework 
also describes the 
required 
organizational 
arrangements 
and 
design 
criteria 
to 
be 
applied 
to 
sub-projects 
during 
project 
implementation 
and 
the 
procedures 
and 
content 
of 
any 
abbreviated 
or 
full 
resettlement 
action 
plans 
if 
and 
as 
required. 
7. 
The 
objective 
of 
the 
Bank’s 
policy 
is 
to 
ensure that 
throughout 
its 
life, 
the 
project 
fully 
complies 
with 
the 
principle 
that 
any 
involuntary 
loss 
of 
assets 
or 
relocation 
of 
economic 
activities 
or 
residence, 
are 
minimized 
and 
fully 
compensated, 
and 
that 
adequate 
procedures 
exist 
for 
prior 
consultation 
of 
all 
affected 
persons 
For 
the 
purposes 
of 
this 
framework, “affected

all 
persons who, 
as 
a

requirements 
for 
financing

as 
detailed 
in 
Operational

for 
any situations that 
may 
arise 
where the need

at 
the 
stage 
of

Legal 
Framework 
9. 
Yemen’s 
legislation provides 
the 
legal 
framework 
for 
this 
RPF. 
The 
conditions 
and 
provisions 
for 
declaring 
areas 
of 
land 
as 
public 
eminent 
domain; 
the 
provisions 
for 
expropriation 
and 
compensation; 
and 
the 
definition 
of 
rights 
of 
owners 
and 
users 
of 
communal 
property 
all 
exist 
in 
law. 
However, 
because 
of 
the 
weakness 
of 
the 
judicial 
system 
and 
the 
presence 
and prevalence 
of 
tribal 
law, 
it 
is 
necessary that 
the 
RPF 
take the 
social context 
into 
account 
and 
adapt 
it 
to 
local 
conditions. 
Laws Goveming 
Propertv 
10. 
The 
Yemeni 
Constitution (Article 
20) 
protects citizens 
from 
the 
general 
expropriation 
of 
their 
assets. 
Public 
Eminent 
Domain 
Law 
(PEDL), 
passed 
by 
parliament 
in 
1995, 
gives governmental bodies 
(including 
governors) the 
right 
to 
acquire 
private property 
for 
projects 
in 
the 
public 
interest. 
Yemeni 
law 
stresses 
that 
land 
expropriation 
is 
to 
take 
place 
only 
in 
the 
event 
that 
no 
suitable 
land 
alternatives 
exist 
that 
are 
already 
in 
the 
public 
domain. 
In 
such 
instances, 
the 
legal 
provisions 
for 
expropriation 
and 
compensation 
will 
apply. 
The 
law 
describes: 
(i) 
situations 
of 
legal 
expropriation; 
(ii) 
procedures 
for 
expropriation; 
(iii) 
the 
agency 
responsible 
for 
valuation 
of 
the compensation 
and 
its 
procedures.

Three 
main 
types 
of 
expropriation 
procedures 
described 
in 
the 
PEDL 
apply to 
this project: 
(i) 
Judicial  Expropriation 
where  the 
state 
declares the  need 
for 
the 
law 
based 
on 
public 
interest; 
(ii) 
Amicable 
Expropriation 
is 
based 
on 
the 
consent 
of 
the 
owners 
and 
compensation 
is 
to 
be valued 
by 
an 
Estimation 
Committee; 
(iii) 
Temporary Appropriation 
is 
when 
governmental 
authorities 
require 
access 
to 
lands 
for 
construction of 
public 
works. 
In 
such 
cases, 
the 
law 
requires 
that 
it 
be returned 
to 
the 
appropriate 
owner 
in 
the 
same 
condition 
that 
it 
was received, 
and the 
implementing 
government agency 
is 
required 
to 
compensate the 
owner 
for 
any 
damages. 
The Evaluation 
Committee 
will 
estimate 
the value 
of 
the 
damages. 
12. 
Article 
59 
in 
the 
State’s 
Real 
Estates 
Law 
also recognizes 
the 
rights 
of 
squatters 
on 
public 
domain 
to 
receive 
compensation 
in 
the event 
of 
involuntary 
settlement 
according 
to 
the 
standards 
set 
by 
the 
technical 
committees 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Agriculture 
and 
Irrigation. 
Laws Govemine

13. 
The 
Yemeni 
Constitution, 
Elections 
Law 
and 
Local

Where 
impacts 
would 
be 
unavoidable, 
Technical 
Secretariat 
of 
the 
Sana’a 
Basin 
Commission 
(TS-SBC) 
will 
notify 
the 
Bank 
by 
means 
of 
a 
brief 
Land 
Acquisition 
Plan 
for 
that 
sub-project, 
and 
the 
information 
provided 
by 
the 
pre-feasibility 
studies. 
This 
Land 
Acquisition 
Plan, based 
on 
the  social 
scientists’ 
findings, 
will 
identify 
and 
justify 
the 
tempomy or 
permanent 
expropriations 
proposed, 
and 
will 
indicate anticipated impacts 
on 
all 
project-affected 
persons, 
including 
those 
who 
lack legal 
or 
formal 
ownership 
of 
affected 
assets. 
The 
precise 
number 
of 
project-affected 
people  that 
will 
require 
compensation 
must 
be included 
in 
the 
Land Acquisition 
Plan 
after 
being 
identified 
in 
a 
census 
carried out 
for 
that  purpose. 
The 
Land 
Acquisition  Plan 
will 
also  include: 
(i) 
specific 
entitlements 
and 
compensations 
or 
other 
remedial 
actions 
to 
be 
taken; 
(ii) 
the

a 
record 
of

initial 
consultations 
with 
the 
affected population. 
18. 
The 
Bank, 
on 
reviewing 
the 
Land 
Acquisition 
Plan, 
will 
advise the 
Ministry 
of 
Agriculture 
and 
Irrigation 
whether 
or 
not 
the 
proposed 
sub-project 
and 
the 
costs 
associated 
with 
implementing 
the 
LAP 
can 
be 
financed 
under 
the loan. 
IDA 
will 
not 
cover 
the 
direct 
costs 
of 
purchasing 
land or 
any other 
cash 
benefits. 
The 
GOY 
should finance 
these 
costs. 
On 
the basis 
of 
the 
LAP, 
the 
Bank 
will 
also advise the 
Ministry 
of 
Agriculture 
and 
Irrigation 
whether a 
full 
or 
abbreviated Resettlement 
Action 
Plan 
should be 
prepared 
and 
whether 
or 
not 
other 
remedial 
actions need 
to 
be 
taken. 
The 
submission 
of 
the 
plan 
and 
its 
approval 
by 
the 
Bank 
is 
a 
condition 
that 
must 
be 
met 
prior 
to 
sub-project 
approval 
and 
the 
initiation 
of 
any 
works. 
Abbreviated 
Resettlement 
Plan 
Procedures 
19. 
Given 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
proposed 
sub-project 
components, 
any 
activity 
that 
may 
cause 
taking of 
land 
or 
other 
assets 
is 
likely to 
affect 
relatively 
few 
people 
(e,g., 
less 
than 
200 
people), 
and 
impacts 
are 
likely to 
be 
relatively minor 
(e.g., 
not 
requiring 
changes 
in 
occupation 
or 
relocation 
of 
residence). 
Under 
such  circumstances, 
an 
abbreviated 
resettlement 
plan 
will 
be 
prepared 
for 
each  sub-project. 
The

Subsequent 
to 
its 
approval 
by 
the 
Bank, the 
Bank 
will 
make 
it 
available 
in 
the 
Infoshop.  The

the Government 
will 
prepare 
a

consultation 
with 
the  beneficiaries  before 
the  design 
of 
any 
sub-projects 
is 
of 
critical 
importance. 
Because 
water 
is 
a common 
asset 
subject 
to 
tribal 
regulations,  the arrangements 
and 
agreements 
for 
the 
use 
of 
water 
from 
any 
dams 
must 
be 
settled 
before 
any 
sub-projects 
are 
developed 
and approved.  There 
are 
instances 
where water 
from 
full 
dams 
cannot 
be 
used 
because 
of 
local 
disputes 
over 
water, 
thus 
the

consultation 
and 
grievance procedures 
are 
documented 
in 
the 
resettlement plans. 
Following 
consultations, 
any 
remedial 
plans 
(e.g. 
abbreviated 
RAP; 
full 
RAP) 
will 
be disseminated 
to 
the 
project-affected 
persons 
in 
a manner 
accessible 
to 
them. 
Information 
disseminated 
to 
the 
project-affected 
persons 
will 
include: 
(i) 
compensation rates 
for 
all 
categories 
of 
affected 
assets; 
(ii) 
eligibility 
criteria 
for 
all 
other 
forms 
of 
assistance 
that 
may 
be  provided;  and 
(iii) 
grievance 
procedures 
(including 
specific 
contact 
information 
for 
initiating, 
or following 
up 
on 
grievances). 
28. 
If 
project-affected 
persons 
are 
not 
satisfied 
with 
proposed 
resettlement 
arrangements, 
or 
if 
they 
are 
dissatisfied 
with 
actual 
resettlement 
implementation, 
they 
can 
first 
seek 
satisfaction 
through 
local 
customary practices 
for 
resolving conflict. 
If 
this 
does 
not 
result 
in 
resolution 
of 
issues, 
project-affected 
persons 
will 
direct their 
grievances 
to 
the special grievance 
committee 
to 
be 
formed 
within 
TS-SBC. 
The 
grievance 
committee 
should 
record 
receipt 
of 
grievances 
and 
reply 
to 
the 
project-affected 
person 
or 
persons 
within 
ten 
days 
after 
receiving 
the 
grievances. 
If 
the grievances 
or 
disputes 
cannot 
be 
resolved 
through administrative 
action,  the 
project-affected  person 
can 
initiate legal 
proceedings 
in 
accordance 
with 
provincial 
and national 
law. 
Institutional 
and 
Implementation 
Arrangements 
29. 
Once 
the 
abbreviated 
or 
full 
resettlement 
Action 
Plan 
has 
been 
approved 
by 
the  Bank,  the 
Ministry 
of 
Agriculture 
and 
Irrigation, 
in 
accordance 
with 
Yemeni 
law, 
shall 
subsequently 
inform 
the 
State 
Real 
Estate 
Authority 
prior to 
beginning 
the 
expropriation 
process. 
30. 
The 
Survey 
Authority 
is 
responsible 
for 
mapping out 
the 
project 
area 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
technical 
experts 
contracted 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Agriculture 
and Irrigation. The 
Ministry 
of 
Agriculture 
and 
Irrigation 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
hiring 
of 
qualified 
expertise, 
including qualified 
sociologists 
to 
undertake 
the 
necessary 
social 
analyses 
as 
previously specified 
in 
this 
document. 
31. 
The Evaluation 
Committee 
will 
estimate 
the 
property 
value 
for 
those 
who 
have 
title. 
If 
public 
land 
is 
occupied 
without 
title,  a 
special 
technical 
committee 
set-up 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Agriculture 
and 
Irrigation 
shall 
assess 
its 
value. 
32. 
Once 
the 
population 
to 
be 
displaced 
has 
been 
identified, 
the 
TS-SBC: 
(i) 
prepares 
a resettlement 
procedures 
manual that 
will 
be 
based 
on 
this 
RPF; 
(ii) 
following 
Bank 
guidelines 
for 
tendering 
and 
selecting 
contractors, 
identifies an 
agency 
to 
implement 
the 
resettlement program; 
and 
(iii) 
and 
prepares 
a 
resettlement 
action 
plan. 
In 
partnership 
with 
TS-SBC, the 
implementing 
agency: 
(i) 
Begins 
the 
consultative 
process 
with 
the community; 
and 
(ii) 
Prepares 
a social 
assessment 
to 
identify 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
population 
to 
be 
displaced.

33. 
Grievances 
or 
other 
claims and 
conflicts 
will 
be resolved according 
to 
the 
measures 
outlined 
above 
(Consultation 
and 
Grievances). 
In 
cases 
of 
disputed claims 
of 
ownership, 
claimants 
have recourse 
to 
the Appellate 
Courts 
and 
the 
Supreme 
Court. 
Financial 
Costs 
34. 
The 
GOY 
will 
finance the costs 
of 
land 
acquisition 
and 
resettlement 
grants. 
The 
IDA 
credit 
will 
cover 
all 
other 
costs 
linked 
to 
resettlement 
(e.g. 
costs 
associated 
with 
housing, 
any 
related technical 
assistance, 
monitoring, 
etc.). 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation 
35. 
The 
requirements 
for 
monitoring 
and  evaluation 
as 
outlined 
here 
will 
be 
incorporated 
into 
whichever resettlement instrument 
is 
required 
(abbreviated 
or 
fill 
RAP). 
The 
primary 
responsibility 
for 
monitoring 
the 
implementation 
of 
resettlement 
measures 
will 
be 
with 
TS-SBC. 
Depending 
on 
the 
degree 
of 
complexity 
of 
the 
required 
measures 
for 
land 
acquisition 
and 
resettlement, several agencies 
may 
be 
involved 
in 
this 
process, 
and 
TS-SBC 
will 
monitor 
them 
all 
as 
well 
as 
coordinate the 
execution 
of 
the 
process. 
External monitoring 
agencies 
will 
also 
be 
contracted 
to 
ensure 
that 
the resettlement process 
is 
fair, 
transparent, 
and 
complete. 
Specific 
monitoring 
indicators 
will 
include 
measures 
of 
inputs, 
outputs, 
outcomes 
and 
impacts 
against 
which 
the resettlement process 
will 
be 
measured. 
Further 
details 
of 
the 
monitoring 
mechanisms 
will 
be detailed 
in 
the Resettlement Procedures 
Manual. The 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
of 
this 
component 
of 
the 
project 
will 
also 
be 
undertaken 
during 
Bank 
supervision missions 
with 
qualified social 
scientists 
participating.
