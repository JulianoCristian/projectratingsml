YEMEN: SANA'A BASIN WATER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM
PHASE I PROJECT - ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REPORT
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
I   The Sana'a Basin is located in central hlghlands of Yemen and includes the capital
city, Sana'a The current population of the basin is estimated at about 1 5 million, of
which 300,000 live in the adjoimng rural areas The basin includes some 110,000 ha of
arable land, of which about 20,000 ha are irrgated Groundwater is the major source of
water in the basin and abstractions began to exceed recharge during the mid-1980s, as a
consequence of rapid urban population growth and a sharp increase in water use by
agriculture, encouraged by the introduction of tubewell technologies The basin is
experiencing a serious depletion of groundwater resources, with an associated degradation
in water quality In addition, a new Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) has rccently
been commissioned to the north of Sana'a, its effluent could provide a valuable water
resource if public health issues could be adequately addressed
Program / Project Objectives
2   To address the water scarcity issues, the Government and the World Bank agreed to
prepare the Sana'a Basin Water Management Program The Program will be implemented
through a 15-year Adaptable Program Credit (APC) financed by the Internatonal
Development Association (IDA) The broad objectives of thls proposed program are to (l)
increase both quantity and the usable life of the groundwater resources available for
domestic and industnal use in the Basin, and so to postpone the date at which new supplies
have to be brought m from outside the Basin; and (ni) simultaneously increase the
efficiency of agnculture water use, so as to allow time for a gradual shift to a less water-
based rural economy in the Basm The objectives of the first 5-year phase of this Program
are to (i) test and develop demand and supply management methods on a limited scale, so
as to apply them on a large-scale throughout the Basin during the subsequent phases of the
program; (n) establish the regulatory, legal and institutional framework needed for more
sustainable water resources management in the Basin, and (iii) carry out the preparation of
the Phase II project of the Program ' The Phase I project is expected to cost $34 0 mnllion
and would be implemented by a number of agencies (described in para 26 below)
EIA Approach, Scope and Methodology
3   Under the Bank's Operational Policy OP 4 01 (and under BP 4.01, GP 4 01) an
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for projects proposed for Bank financing to help
ensure that they are environmentally sound and sustainable, and thus to improve decision
making The Borrower is responsible for carrying out the EIA IDA advised the
A full EIA for Phase II will be made by independent experts when the scope of that phase is fully
defined (approximately Year 4 of the present project) and will be completed in draft form and disclosed
to all stakeholders pnor to the appraisal of Phase II by the World Bank
1



Government on the Bank's EA requirements and reviewed the draft EIA to determine
whether it provides an adequate basis for processing the project for IDA financing This
EIA evaluates the project's potential environmental risks and impacts in its area of
intervention, examines project alternatives, and, identifies ways of improving project
design and implementation by preventing, mimmizing, and mitigating the impacts Given
that prevention is preferred over mitigation, some of the mitigating measures have already
been incorporated in the project design
4   The objectives of this Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) are to (i) examine the
environment issues and impacts associated with the water resources, irrigation and
agricultural strategies, policies, programs and projects in the basin, (ni) evaluate and
compare these impacts against those of possible alternatives, (iii) assess legal and
institutional aspects relevant to the issues and impacts; and (iv) recommend broad
measurcs to strengthen environmental management in the sector In addition, a separate
social assessment has been made, covermg issues such as attitudes to water, gender roles,
and, possible resettlement issues
5   The EIA team consisted of an international expert and Team Leader (Dr Robert A
Boydell), a Pest Management Specialist (Dr Amin Abdullah Al Hemyari), a Biodiversity
Specialist (Dr Abdul Karim Nasher), a Cultural Hentage Specialist (Mr Saba Taher Al
Suleihi), and a Public Health Specialist (Mr. Khalid Yasm Al Dubai) The Dam Safety
Expert, Mr Mohamed Mahir Iskandar, also made valuable contributions Dr Peter W
Whitford assisted in the final editing All members are independent of the project
implementing agencies and the project design consultants. The team reviewed the
extensive documentation available, including previous reports and studies and undertook
detailed field surveys of the proposed dam sites and surrounding areas A limited survey of
farmers' practices and use of pesticides was also undertaken. Interviews were conducted
with all the stakeholders, including the local communities and farmers, and a number of
pnncipal informants2. The consultation and disclosure meetings are described in detail in
the main body of the report (Chapter 7) and summanzed in the following section
6   This EIA has been prepared in parallel with and benefited from the project
preparation studies This EIA considers the natural environment (water and land); human
health and safety; and social aspects of the proposed intervention. It reflects the country's
conditions, particularly limited baseline data and information, and the country's overall
policy framework, national legislation, and institutional capabilities related to the
environment and the proposed project
7   The present EIA is designed to satisfy both the requirements of the Yemeni
legislation and those of the World Bank According to the Environmental Protection Law
No 26 of 1995 and Cabinet Decree No. 89 of 1993, EIAs are required for infTastructure
projects, including the present project3 Accordmgly, the Yemen Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) was included in the scoping and consultation workshops in May 2001 and
November 2002 The Government reviewed the final draft document in December 2002
and authorized its disclosure to stakeholders The World Bank has placed the project in
Category A/SI under its environmental assessment policy, OP 4 01, because of the
diversity and complexity of the potential negative environmental impacts it presents, the
inclusion of dam construction, and the possible need for involuntary resettlement Thus a
full EIA, including an Environmental Management Plan (EMP), arc requwred

Consultation and Disclosure
8   A scoping workshop and a series of four stakeholder consultations were held in the
course of project preparation, culmmatmg in a workshop on November 2, 2002, at which a
draft of this EIA and EMP were discussed. Participants mcluded government officials,
NGOs, farmers and other stakeholders The main issues of concern m this set of meetings
included shortcomings m the new Water Law, effectiveness of proposed project works,
WWTP concerns; inadequate control of water use, and, a lack of trust between farmers and
government The result was broad consensus on the principal potential environmental
impacts of the project and the proposed mitigation measures in the draft EMP Provision
has been made in the project for further public consultations in the course of its
implementation.
9 Following presentations of a draft of this EIA and EMP by the governmcntal agencies
concerned, and its subsequent review by them, the Executive Summary was made
available to the public in English and Arabic at the public library, University of Sana'a,
EPA, and PPT, as well as the full report in English, with a full Arabic translation of the
Main Report also made available Following authorization from the govemnment, the
World Bank has made the drafts available through its Infoshop and its Resident Mission in
Sana'a
Basin Characteristics
10 The Sana'a basin (Map 1) is a plain surrounded by mountains, with an area of 3,200
km2 and an average elevation of 2,200 meters above mean sea level The climate is arid,
with only 200 to 400 mm of rain in two short seasons Ramfall events result in brief floods
down the wadis4, some of which is captured for irngation, the remainder either evaporates
or seeps through the sand and gravel beds to recharge the shallow aquifers whlch underlie
most of the basin A deeper, sandstone aquifer contains fossil water from a previous
geological penod, its present recharge is very small.
11. Traditionally, farmers have devised a complex system for surface water harvesting
and conservation However, over the past thirty years or so, groundwater extraction in the
basin has dramatically increased both for agriculture and for municipal water supply, and
has severely disturbed the balance between natural recharge and use causing a rapid
decline in aquifer levels The volume of groundwater recharge in the basin has been
subject to great debate - a best estimate is about 100 Mm3/year Estimated water use in the
year 2000 was 250 Mm3 - 200 to 210 Mm3 for agriculture, 38 Mm3 for domestic supplies
and 3 5 Mm3 for industry. The annual deficit (total use minus total recharge) is, therefore,
estimated at 150 Mm3/year, leading to a rapid depletion of groundwater storage The
aquifer will be fully depleted in twenty or thirty years unless drastic measures are taken to
check thls trend.
12 Groundwater quality for irlgation is generally quite good in the shallow aquwfers of
the penphery of the basin and conforms with WHO and Yemeni standards and guidelines
However, there is some concern in the central areas, where the population is more
concentrated and irrgation more intensive. Some small pockets of salinity exist and
special precautions wlll soon be needed Water quality is suitable for drinking in the deep
(fossil) aquwfer and conforms with WHO and Yemeni standards and guidelines for
drinking water

13 Imgated land has increased sevenfold in the last twenty years, mainly for qat5,
grapes, fruits and vegetables, while cereals dominate the rainfed lands A Rapid Rural
Appraisal was carried out to survey attitudes regarding water One quarter of farmers do
not have access to imgation, while the remainder generally use a combination of both
surface and groundwater However, all farmers would use additional water if made
available to them, and concern for over-exploitation of the groundwater resource was not
seen as a prionty
14 Until recently, water use in Yemen has been largely unregulated. However, a new
Water Law has now been ratified which codifies water rights, regulate the use of surface
and groundwater, and set penalties for non-compliance. Executive Regulations or bylaws
are presently being drafted which will provide the definitions and powers to enforce the
law A number of shortcomings in the law have been identified, for example, wells less
than 60 meters deep need not be registered and metering of abstraction is not requwred
However, Article 49 of the law provides for certain areas to be designated "Water
Conservation and Protected from Pollution Areas" Designating the Sana'a Basin as a
conservation area would provide a degree of protection Pesticide and fertilizer storage,
sale and use is not well controlled, despite the existence of the Environmental Protection
Law of 1995 whlch was intended to regulate their use. No Executive Regulations (bylaws)
have yet been issued regarding pesticides use
15 The Sana'a WWTP was completed in 2000 but is suffering from a number of design
and operational problems Although the plant was funded by other donors, it falls within
the influence of the project and must be taken into consideration, as it has serious
environmental implication for the Sana'a Basin. The plant's incoming sewage is much
stronger than anticipated at the design stage (BOD 1,300 mg/l, SS 1,100 mg/I), which
makes it difficult to treat and reduces the life of the plant Resulting sludge volumes are
greater than cxpected and large quantities of poorly stabilized sludge are being
accumulated and inhibit the activated sludge treatment process Frequent power failures
and malfunctioning of back-up equipment add to the problems, and there have been
numerous periods where raw sewage is bypassed around the plant into an adjacent wadi
Although the plant can sometimes meet its effluent design standard in terms of BOD and
SS reduction, recent test have indicated the presence of vanous pathogens in the effluent,
including helminths and bactena Regardless of the quality of the effluent, some 600
farmers downstream have formed a cooperative to pump it out of thc wadi for use in the
irrigation of approximately 280 ha of crops, including vegetables This poses a
considerable health risk both to the farmers and to the ultimate consumers of the produce
In addition, aquifer recharge from this source could degrade groundwater quality over a
large area. The WWTP is managed by the Sana'a Local Water Supply Corporation who
are presently seeking to enter into a "leased management" contract for its assets.
16 Several of the most common diseases of the Sana'a basin are water related - diarrhea,
typhoid, and malaria. However, as malaria mosquitoes cannot survive at the altitude of the
basin, it is thought that malaria cases are contracted outside the project area
Schistosomiasis or bilharzia is prevalent in the basin and is transmitted through a host snail
that lives in slowly moving water Its prevalence could potentially be exacerbated by the
project works Other potential health issues are related to pesticides use and the WWTP
discussed above. The poor environmental samtation in the basm may also be a contnbuting
factor to the incidence of bilharzia
17 While Sana'a City is nch in cultural heritage, the rural areas also contain valuable
ancient terraces, water cisterns and irrigation systems However, field inspections of the

proposed new dam sites (Annex 1) found none of these6 and no other visible ancient
remains or locations of importance in local folk tradition The possibility of buned sites or
artifacts is dealt with in para 37
18 Field reviews of flora and fauna were also made at the proposed new dam sites,
including interviews with nearby residents (Annex 1) No rare or cndangered species of
fauna were encountered or reported. For flora, a specimen of a succulent plant (Klelna
pendula) was found in the vicimty of the proposed Bahman dam site, though not in the
immediate construction area Whlle this species is rare in the Sana'a Basin, it is described
in the literature as "tolerably frequent" (i e not rare or endangered) in other areas of
Yemen7. Field tests by one of the authors (Nasher) show that this species can be
successfully transplanted. Proposed mitigation measures are set out in para 38 No other
rare or endangered species of flora were found at the sites proposed for project-supported
activities
The Sana'a Basin Water Management Project
19 Following the objectives set out above, the project would focus on 10 sub-basins (out
of 22) selected because they exhibit a high chance of success and present favorable
environmental conditions, such as potential of increased recharge and improved irrigation
efficiency. Project activities are grouped under the following components
Component 1 DemandManagement andIrrigation Improvement - $13 2 million
20 This component seeks to achieve water savings and conservation in agriculture by
increasmg the efficiency of water use for irrigation, through introduction of modern
imgation equipment. The component would focus on all or part of the 10 proposed project
sub-basins, with a total imgated area of 12,500 ha, about half of the basin-wide irrigation
area The irrigation improvement target zones of the project would cover about 4,000 ha
These areas have proven the most suitable during stakeholder assessments in the course of
project preparation. Activities would include water conservation (upgrading piped delivery
systems, conversion of open channel to piped systems, provision of pressunzed imgation
systems, land leveling and plastic greenhouses) and community orgamuzation (formation of
Water User Associations)
Component 2 SupplyManagement andRecharge Improvement - $10 5 million
21 This component would enhance groundwater recharge through dams, sub-surface
dams and other structures and would make a number of existmg dams safe It is expected
that the farmers would then pump from the shallow aquifers instead of deep aquifers,
which are a crntical supply source of drinking water for Sana'a City The project would
(i) build five recharge structures, including dams up to 18 m high In addition, the project
would study and implement other potentially viable recharge technologies, such as
underground dams, to catch sub-surface flows in wadis, spate breakers, and wadi spurs for
directing flash floods to favorable recharge areas, (n) rehabilitate existing dams to prevent
potential dam failure, as well as to recover recharge capacity diminished by accumulated
sediments, (iii) establish a sustamable dam management system through strengthened
capacity, and (iv) implement hydro-geological investigations, momtoring and modeling at
basin, sub-basin, and field levels in order to assess the current aquifer situation, as well as
the project impacts on aquifer conditions Existing dams are of a variety of types (masonry
and concrete gravity, earthfill and rockfill) The new dams would be rockfill, except for
one concrete gravity dam.

Component 3. Institutional Development and Capacity Building - $4.5 million
22   This component would support. (i) regulatory framework development and
application, (n) basin water management, and (iii) basin hydrogeological and water
resources investigations and monitonng.
Component 4 Information and Public Awareness Campaign (IPAC) - $1 4 million
23.  IPAC would deliver specifically targeted messages on water conservation to a wide
range of stakeholders
Component 5 Environmental Management Plan (EMP) - $1.3 million
24   This component would implement the recommendations of the EIA - see para 33
and Appendix A.
Component 6 ProjectManagement andMontoring - $2 4 million
Component 7 Preparation of Phase II - $0 7 million
25   A Sana'a Basin Commission (SBC) has already been created    A Technucal
Secretanat to the SBC (TS-SBC) would be established to oversee and monitor overall
project implementation and to assume responsibility for financial and procurement
management of the entire project (para 26)
Project Institutional Framework
26   A number of institutions, at both national and local levels, governmental and non-
governmental, are involved in the project Through TS-SBC, the SBC would be
responsible for project momtonng, financial management, procurement, traimng and
support for other agencies and overall implementation of the EMP. The National Water
Resources Authority (NWRA) would have responsibility for the integrated management
and related regulatory and enforcement system, monitonng of water resources and
licensing of wells The Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation (MAI), through the General
Directorate of Irngation (GDI), and the Department of Plant Protection (DPP) would have
respective responsibilities for dam construction and pest management The Ministry of
Health and Population (MHP) would be responsible for public health issues Other
agencies involved include the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the General
Authonty for Antlquities, Museums and Manuscnpts (GAAMM), the international donor
community and national and mternational NGOs.
Project Alternatives
27   In the course of project preparation, the followmg alternatives were considered
Their overall environmental implications are noted
28 Do Nothing This would allow groundwater and water quality levels to decline further
and has obvious negative economic and social consequences Needless to say, the
environmental consequences would also be disastrous - rapid depleton of both the
shallow and the non-renewable deep aquifers, pollution of both aquifers from surface
sources and cross-connection, and increasing salinity of the groundwater resource If
unchecked, these impacts would be increasingly difficult and expensive to reverse
6



29 Importing Water from Outside the Sana 'a Basin. Options range from water transfer
from basms adjacent to Sana'a to desalinated seawater - a distance of about 200 km and an
elevation change of 2,200 m Cost for trans-basin transfers range from about US$1/m3 to
about US$8/m3 - desalination and lifting to Sana'a Even the lower end of this range is
likely to be unaffordable for Yemen in the foreseeable future The nsk for political and
social conflicts, especially for transfers from areas where water is already used, is high
This has been demonstrated elsewhere, notably in Taiz (Taiz Water Supply Project)
Environmental impacts from any trans-basin project, involving reservoirs, pipelines, canals
and pumping stations, would likely exceed those of the selected project
30    Top-Down Approach to Water Resources Management Commumty involvement in
water resources management is difficult and time consummng, and outcomes may differ
from what planners predict Hence, a more top-down approach was considered for the
proposed project. It was rejected, due to the following findings from sector work, other
projects and from experiences elsewhere in Yemen (i) in Yemen only local communal
institutions have shown potential for success in groundwater management, (n) water
management institutions have to include m one form or another all those who have water
rights, perceived rights and therefore an interest in water management, and (iii) a 'top-
down' central mstitution may have some impact as an 'umbrella' or framework for
regulation, but only if it responds to the demands of broad-based stakeholder
orgamzations As top-down solutions tend to be more capital mtensive and less concerned
with better management of existing assets, the cnvironmental impacts of such an
alternative would likely be more severe than for the selected project
31. The selected project is to be preferred to any of the above alternatives in terms of
environmcntal impact The EIA was not able to identify any other alternative to the
selected project which would reduce impacts even further
Application of Bank Safeguard Policies
32 In accordance with OP 4 01, this project has been placed in Category A /SI for a
number of reasons (i) the number of safeguard policies triggered, (n) the complexities of
implementation, difficult to predict impacts of intervening in a complex surface and
groundwater regime, at present not being managed in a sustainable manner, (ini) the
inclusion of dams in the investment program, albeit fairly modest structures, and, (iv) the
complex social issues of traditional water rights and allocation in Yemen Application of
the Bank Environmental and Social Safeguard Policies led to the following determination
"Yes" means that the policy is tnggered and requires close examination and mitigation
World Bank Environmental and Safeguard Policies            Applicability
Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01, BP 4.01, GP 4.01)            Yes
Natural Habitats (OP 4.04, BP 4.04, GP 4.04)                    No
Forestry (OP 4.36, GP 4.36)                                     No
Pest Management (OP 4.09)                                       Yes
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12)                           Yes
Safety of Dams (OP 4.37, BP 4.37)                               Yes
Cultural Property (OPN 11.03)                                   No
Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20)                                     No

Projects in Disputed Areas (OP 7.60, BP 7.60, GP 7.60)          No
The policies on Natural Habitats and Cultural Property are not considered tnggered by the
proposed project, as identified potential impacts are limited in their scope. Field surveys
encountered only one specimen of a locally rare species of plant, which would be

transplanted if encountered dunng construction. There are no known archeological sites
near the proposed work sites Provisions for chance archeological finds are spelled out in
Appendix C.
Potential Environmental and Social Impacts and Their Mitigation
33. The environmental and social issues raised by the project may be grouped as follows
*   Design issues, including sitng
*   Construction issues, especially for dams
*   Operational issues
*   Dam safety issues
*   Sustainability issues, especially water quality
*  Pesticides issues
*   Health issues
*   WWTP issues
*   Resettlement issues
Each set of issues is now discussed, along with recommended mitigation measures The
latter are spelled out in dctail in the matrix presented in Appendix A - Environmental
Management Plan. For ease of reference, potential impacts from dam construction and
proposed mitigation measures are also set out in Table 1

34 Design Issues. These relate mainly to the dams to be constructed under Component 2
of the project "Supply Management and Recharge Improvements" and their access roads
Eleven existing dams will be rehabilitated and five new dams will be constructed, one of
which will be a series of cascades These are fairly small dams, only two of the new dams
are higher than 15 meters Sites for new dams have been selected after detailed feasibility
studies, which took environmental impacts into account. Access roads will be sited to
avoid settlements, cultivated lands and terraces, cultural property and valuable ecosystems
and to minimize visual impact They will also be designed with adequate drainage and
controls on erosion. Existing quarries and borrow pits would be used where possible or
new facilities would be sited so as to avoid cultural property and valuable ecosystems, to
minimize hydrologic and sediment impacts, as well as visual impacts New dams will be
designed, and existing dams would be rehabilitated to meet accepted international design
practices for dams of this type and size8
35. Construction Issues. The short-term environmental pollution nsks and worker health
and safety needs, associated with the construction phase of the project, will be mitigated
through a number of measures, most of which would be stipulated in the terms of contract
with the construction enterpnse Compliance with these measures will be the responsibility
of the TS-SBC, which will supervise the works Non-compliance will be penalized through
invocation of penalty clauses For all project works under components 1 and 2, quality
assurance plans should be prepared prior to construction The contractor(s) will
progressively rehabilitate the work areas to ensure that disturbed sites, which are
susceptible to erosion, will not remain exposed for long penods Sites will be restored to
their onginal contours and revegetated where directed
36 Component 1 of the project (Demand Management and Irrigation Improvement) will
involve only small-scale construction, such as trenching for laying pipelines Shoring may
need to be provided in deeper trenches to ensure worker safety Component 1 will involve
heavier construction and a senes of measures should be taken to mimnuze impacts9 A
dam construction manual, now under preparation, should be completed pnor to the start of
dam construction To reduce noise, work should not be undertaken between 9 p m and 6
am Worksites, quarnes and access roads should be watered as needed to suppress dust
Additional noise and dust suppression measures should be taken for quarries and stone-
crushers, especially if located near inhabited areas Asphalt and concrete batchmng plants
should provide controls to reduce air pollution and pollution of surface and groundwater
Fuelmg should take place at least 100 m from watercourses or recharge areas, controls to
prevent spillage should be in place, and contractors should be equipped to clcan up any
accidental spills. Strict measures for the transport, storage and use of explosives should be
in place
37 While no visible archeological sites or artifacts were identified at the dam sites during
the EIA field inspections, the possibility of chance finds remains in a culturally rich
environment like Yemen, especially during excavation under Components 1 and 2.
Appendix C sets out the proposed provisions to be included in contract documents to deal
with such events They call for the cessation of construction while the find is reported to
GAAMM, who will decide on the appropnate procedures to be followed, including
removal or preservation Changes in project layout could result in some cases While the
procedures of Appendix C are somewhat ahead of previous practice in Yemen, they mirror
current practice in neighbonng countnes The project would thus serve as a model for
8 For example, US Bureau of Reclamation, "Design of S'mall Dams", Sherard "Earth and Earth Rock
Dams"
9 They should be considered also for Component I on a base by case basis



upgradmng Yemen's procedures In addition, any ancient terraces or structures adjacent to
project works would be protected from damage and plundenng for rock
38 Any rarc or endangered plants (such as Kleinia pendula (para 18)) which might be
affected by construction would be transplanted to safe locations, as directed by the ERT
39 To ensure their health and safety, workers will be provided with safe drinking water
and sanitation facilities, suitable clothing, first aid posts and training in safe work
practices
40 Operational Issues. No operational environmental issues were identified with respect
to Component 1, as its effect will be to improve imgation efficiency and, by replacing open
ditches with pipes, reduce disease vector habitat. The proposed pest management activities
(para 44) will counteract any tendency to increase pesticide use following imgation
improvement For the Supply Component, operational issues are manly covered in the
section on Dam Safety below. Agreements on mimmum monthly releases downstream of
dams (probably in tenms of penods of opening of outlets) would be made by the farmer
groups to protect the traditional rights of downstream spate irrigators Conditions m the
wadi beds downstream of dams would be observed to identify any undue scourmg due to
hlgh velocity discharges from dam outlcts If necessary, remedial works, such as check
dams, gabions and spurs, would be implemented The siltation of reservoirs is a problem
that should be addressed by the project In a number of existing dam sites that were
inspected by the Dam Safety Expert, silt had built up over the years to more than three
meters thick, which effectively reduced the possibility of groundwater recharge. Regular
desiltmg is required to ensure the recharge potential of the dams The silt can be disposed
of in two ways: first, by using as a soil conditioner in nearby farms, or second, by land
filling in depressions away from the dam site.
41 Safety of Dams (OP 4.37, BP 4.37). The rehabilitation of existing dams proposed for
this project is itself a mitigation measure to address safety hazards Out of 44 dams m the
basin, 24 were assessed as needing rehabilitation, of which 11 may pose a senous safety
risk for downstream populations and require immediate work They were included in the
proposed project after review by a dam safety specialist Five new dams will be built as
recharge structures only two exceed 15 meters (16 and 18 m), two are small dams, and the
fifth is a cascading series of check structures In addition, other smaller surface retention,
or sub-surface structures will be tested during project implementation The selection of the
dam sites was based on a rapid social assessment, which determined the level of
community demand The new dams and the ones selected for rehabilitation are relatively
small in size and located in remote and barren areas with small local populations These
dams are intended to be aquifer recharge structures rather than impounding structures, they
are dry for up to 9 months a year.
42 A dam safety expert has visited all sites and preliminarily concluded that the sites and
foreseen work would not pose any safety risk However, an intemational expert will also
be retained to review feasibility studies, final designs and bidding documents, and to
participate in the Mid-Term Review. In addition, non-structural safety measures have been
recommended and would be followed up by the implementing agency (MAI GDI), such as
installation of instrumentation and monitoring devices, operation and maintenance plans,
including emergency preparedness plans, and establishment of a panel of three national
experts, who would supervise final designs and safety measures A plan for the
construction supervision and quality assurance and an instrumentation plan have been
prepared, together with a preliminary O&M plan The emergency preparedness plan will
be finalized during implementation.

43 Sustainability Issues. There have been a number of studies in the past that have tried
to model and charactenze the complex recharge mechamsm of the Sana'a Basm which are
not fully understood. This project, through its intensive monitonng program, will attempt
to clanfy the process and will buwld appropriate interventions into subsequent phases of the
program. While the program, of which this project is the first phase, is intended to promote
sustamability of groundwater development by slowing the rate of depletion, there is ample
evidence from elsewhere in the worldl that, when available water resources are morc
intensively used, water quality inevitably declines This is less of a problem for drinking
water, which can usually be treated economically However, water quality is already
marginal for irrigation in some parts of the basin due to high levels of dissolved salts
Given the complex nature of the project interventions, their impact on water quality is
difficult to predict. However, it is likely that changes should be relatively slow Therefore,
it is recommended that the monitonng program for water quality outlined below and the
modeling provided for in Component 6 of the project "Management and Monutoring" be
used to analyze trends and develop any mitigation measures needed under Phase II
44 Pest Management (OP 4.09) Pesticides and fertilizers are used freely and
increasmgly in the project area Even though there is no direct linkage between the nsing
use and the proposed project, the EIA proposes that a model Pest Management Plan,
recently developed for grape cultivation be implemented in pilot areas and that a similar
plan be developed for the other major crop - qat - dunng the first six months of project
implementation and subsequently implemented The inclusion of qat is somewhat
controversial, while qat is the predominant crop in the Sana'a Basin, occupying some 47%
of irngated area, its consumption raises senous political, social and public health issues
Among the latter are risks from the ingestion of pesticides. Reducing the cultivation or
consumption of qat is considered to be beyond the scopc of the project However, its
consumption could be made somewhat less nsky with appropriate measures to mimmize
pesticide residues For both crops, the excessive and improper use of pesticides will be
mitigated through the demonstration of a model integrated pest management (IPM) plan in
the project areas. The plan is both a mitigation measure against harm that may occur from
excessive use of chemicals, and a learming instrument for the DPP, which would be in
charge of implementing it, to gain expenence with alternative means to combat plant pests.
If successful, it could be replicated for other areas in the basin and the country An
accompanying farmer education program, which will stress good and safe practice for
pesticides application and storage in the field, will be developed. Regular testing for
pCsticide residues will be done by the MAI Pesticides Laboratory, which will receive
support from the project for equipment and tramnng Furthermore, a program of monitoring
the quality of groundwater used by the farmers in the vicinity of the project intervention
will be developed
45 Health Issues. Schistosomiasis (or Bilharzia as it is commonly known) is a water
related disease spread by a snail that lives in slowly moving water. It is prevalent in areas
around the Sana'a Basin, where some 2,075 cases were recorded durmg the first four
months of 2001, 341 of which were in the pilot areas. There is some danger that its
prevalence could be increased by the project works. Mitigation of public health nsks from
bilharzia related to the project will be undertaken by the MHP Bilharzia Control
Campaign Regular inspections of water bodies close to human habitations will take place
to detect and identify the breeding of vectors and contain any colonies found through
controlled spraying of insecticides and molluscicides. Bilharzia statistics will be monitored
with close attention to the project intervention sub-basms for any unusual pattern
Momtonng will be on a monthly basis as part of the ongoing effort by the existing climcs
and health facilities in the project area, which will also provide drugs to affected persons.
A public health/bilharzia specialist will be made available to the Environmental Resource
1 For example, Central Asia, the Indus Basm, the Westem United States, and Australia
13



Team (para. 58) to develop and oversee health education and control measures
Environmental samtation in the basin is poor and is a contributing factor to bilharzia and
the hlgh incidence of diarrhea Health and hygiene education focused on sanitation will be
undertaken as part of the bilharzia control program A further potential health risk is
related to the Sana'a WWTP, discussed below While cases of malaria are commonly
found in the Sana'a basin, research indicates that these are imported from lower altitudes,
as the vector mosquitoes cannot survive at the basin elevation of more than 2,000 m Thus,
the project would not affect malana prevalence
46 WWTP Issues. As noted in para. 15 above, the design and operational problems of
the Sana'a WWTP pose clear health risks to the population, both to farmers using the
effluent for irrigation and to consumers of the crops they produce, especially vegetables
eaten raw There are also nsks to the environment, to the ecosystems along the wadi, and
to groundwater quality. These problems are most severe when raw sewage is being
bypassed around the plant because of a variety of operational problems (para 15) but, even
when the treatment process is working correctly and the effluent standard in terms of BOD
and SS are within acceptable ranges, reuse of the effluent calls for greater monitonng,
education of users and restrictions on the crops grown, because of the pathogenic content
of the effluent. The present inability to stabilize and dry the uncxpectedly large volumes of
sludge is also creating an increasingly severe health and environmental threat, as the partly
stabilized wet sludge also contains high levels of pathogens, which cannot be rendered safe
until drying and degradation has taken place As part of the preparation of this project, a
Rapid Assessment of the environmental impacts of the WWTP (Annex 9) has been made
47 Addressing these issues will require two types of actions First, short term actions
(descnbed below) have been agreed to ameliorate the immediate problems. Second, the
completion of a detailed WWTP Environmental Audit, followed by (or combined with)
the completion of final designs for and implementation of WWTP improvcment works,
likely to include increased area of sludge drying beds, construction of detention tanks to
avoid bypassing the plant, primary settling tanks to reduce the sludge load and odor
control
48 It is expected that the detailed design study for the improvement works will be funded
by the Government, and that the civil works would be funded from the Arab Fund It will
be important to obtain legally binding guarantees under this project that the environmental
audit and plant modifications will take place in a timely manner It has been proposed that
the WWTP will be managed in the future through a lease contract It is essential that
performance guarantees and penalties for non-performance be specified in the contract
49  The "short term actions" that could be instituted durmng thc first year of project
implementation should include (but not be limited to) the following
*  Removal of the accumulated dried sludge within the WWTP to a land fill site.
*  A "red flag" system to warn farmers when raw sewage is being bypassed.
*  Farmer education on the hazards of treated and untreated wastewater, through the
IPAC (para 58).
*  A ban on the use of effluent to Tirgate vegetables eaten raw (or equivalent actions)
The proposed monitoring program (para 56) will provide monitonng of the quality of
effluent and sludge, suspended solids and other contaminants. Moreover, a study to
review the feasibility of wastewatcr reuse for restricted irrigation and the use of sludge as a
soil conditioner is presently being undertaken with parallel funding from CIDA The
findings to be published in mid-2003 will be of great benefit in determining the optimum
means for waste disposal and maintaining public health
14



50 Resettlement Issues"i. Of the social safeguard policies, only that on resettlement (OP
4 12) is triggered, with regard to the land acquisition issues related to impoundments In
the majonty of cases, the land to be flooded would be "common land", not used for
productive purposes and owned by the community. In only one case has a home of eleven
persons been identified, on the margins of a reservoir, that would require relocation
Nevertheless, there may be cases when individually owned land may be inundated, in
whlch case GDI's pragmatic, demand-based approach for 'land acquisition' would apply
GDI traditionally responds to a community demand for dam construction by a survey of
the area, identifying the land that would be flooded The communities and responsible
local councils internally discuss and agree on compensation (in most cases a substitute
land area) and sign a tnpartite contract (commumty, council, GDI) that no compensation
from the Government is required This contract or letter of agreement is rcgistered at the
Civil Registry Office The land contribution constitutes the community's share towards the
construction of the dam and the benefits denved from it If no agreement is reached, no
dam is built This policy has been m force since 1994 and has so far never led to a dispute
It is therefore highly unlikely that there would be involuntary resettlement in the project
for the five new dams Land issues for the rehabilitation dams werc settled during their
original construction If there are conflicts with downstream or adjacent communuties they
must reach a documented agreement on allocation of water rights before GDI would
commence construction of the dam
51 A resettlement policy framework and a land acqusition assessment for the five new
dams have been drafted and found to be acceptable to the Bank'2 For the expected
situations descnbed above, the framework requires a remedial plan, containing
information and sketch maps of the land to be acquired, an enumeration of persons
affected, a table of compensation entitlements (and verification of their availability), a
timetable, organizational and financial arrangements, and consultation and grievance
procedures Such plans will be made publicly available in Arabic and shall be approved by
the Bank prior to the execution of sub-projects tnggenng OP 4 12 The framework also
provides for the case that there is involuntary resettlement or other significant or large-
scale impacts, by specifying a full Resettlement Action Plan, as required by OP 4 12
Environmental Monitoring Plan
52 There is inevitably some overlap between: (i) the momtoring needed to determine the
achievement of project objectives, whlch are in themselves an improvement of the
environment, (ii) the implementation of environmental mntigation measures, and (in) the
measurement of trends in environmental status indicators The monutoring plan sct out
below alms mainly to cover the second category, but with some elements of the third
category that may be necessary to check for longer-term impacts Monitonng measures
may be grouped as follows
*  Water resources
*  Dam safety
*  Pesticides
*  Public health
* WWTP
Though, strictly speaking, resettlement is a social rather an environmental safeguard issue, it is
briefly summarnzed here because of its close linkagc with other issues related to dam and reservoir
construction For a full analysis, see "Resettlement Policy Framework", July 29, 2002

All monitonng data would be made available to the public in English and Arabic in a
booklet through the EPA and the TS-SBC on request
53 Water Resources. A strengthened system of water resources monitonng will be
needed, both to measure the effectiveness of environmental mitigation actions, and also to
detect long-term trends, which may influence the design of the second phase A water
quality monitonng strategy would be developed in the form of a manual and training
provided to NWRA SB and EPA staff. Until adequate institutional capacity has been
developed the monutonng should be subcontracted to a competent body such as WEC at
the University of Sana'a. For surface water, staff gauges would be installed at all new and
existing reservoirs and read daily, when water is being stored Staff gauges would also be
installed in the main wadis and read at four-hourly intervals (if possible) dunng flood
events. Analyses of recharge rates would be made for each wadi at the end of each rainy
season For groundwater, additional monitonng wells (piezometers) would be installed
throughout the project area and read weekly The quality of surface and groundwater
would be momtored monthly during the growing season and their suitability for irrigation
assessed annually Parameters to be measured are set out in the main report Surveys of the
depth and volumes of reservoir sediment would be made at the end of each dry season for
all project dams Wherever possible, the farmer communities would be cncouraged to
participate in the monitoring
54 Dam Safety. A detailed monitonng program will be prepared for each dam (new,
rehabilitated and others) dunng the final design phase by MAI GDI, under the guwdance of
the POE. This would be set out in a manual and trammg in its use would be provided to
relevant staff The Manual would specify responsibilities, equipment, frequencies of
measurements and types of analyses to be performed. Results would be reviewed by the
POE annually and by an international dam safety specialist at the Mid-Term Review GDI
would also perform a visual mspection of all dams twice annually, when full and when
dry, and take appropriate follow-up action m case of any observed problems
55 Pest Management. Water quality monitonng (para 53) will include annual
measurements of pesticide residues in groundwater Momtoring of residues in crop
samples will also be made annually MAI DPP will undertake monthly surveys of
knowledge, aptitude and practice with respect to IPM techniques of project area qat and
grape farmers during the growing season, in order to gauge the effectiveness of the pest
management program and to make any necessary adjustments
56 Public Health. The prevalence of bilharzia vectors (snails) will be monitored
annually by MHP in all reservoirs and other standing or flowing water bodies The
incidence of bilharzia infection will also be monitored annually by MHP from local
climcal data
57. WWTP. For effluent leaving the plant, suspended solids and biochemical oxygen
demand (BOD5) will be monitored each three days by the plant's laboratory staff Full
physical, chemical and microbiological analyses would be made monthly Dned sludge to
be used outsidc the plant would be subjected to weekly physical, chemical and
microbiological analyses. Should a lease management contract for the WWTP be agreed
by the Sana'a Local Corporation, the lessee would have to comply with performance
indicators embodied m the contract
Institutional Actions
58 A number of agencies would be responsible to ensure timely implementation of the
EMP, these are summanzed in Table 2 below. Implementation would be facilitated by the
establishment within the TS-SBC of an Environmental Resource Team (ERT), consisting
16



of a full-time environmental specialist, together with "on call" specialists in biodiversity,
cultural hentage and other disciplines as needed. The team would join inspections of dam
sites during construction, inter alia to ensure that any rare flora are identified and chance
finds of artifacts are properly dealt with.
59 An Information and Public Awareness Campaign (IPAC) umt would be established in
NWRA SB under Component 4 of the project, mainly to increase public awareness of
water scarcity. IPAC would also support the Environmental Resource Team, DPP and
MHP m improving awareness of the risks of pesticides, malana, bilharzia and WWTP
effluents.
60 Support will bc made available to the MAI DPP and to MHP to prepare detailed
implementation plans for pest management and public health respectively and for the
incremental costs of carrying them out
61. A Panel of Experts (POE) will be formed of Yemem specialists in dam design,
construction and monitorng - supplemented as needed by international expertise - to
(i) review and approve all designs for new dams and rehabilitation works for existing
dams, (u) review specifications for such works, (mii) periodically review construction
quality, (iv) design and oversee the installation of momtonng instruments; (v) review and
analyze momtoring data, and (vi) visually inspect all dams (new and existing) at least
twice a year.
62 MAI GDI are planmng institutional restructunng, including physical and managerial
reforms, in order to improve their services and performance particularly at field level
Support and training would be provided to strengthen their environmental, watcr quality
monitoring, and dam safety functions. Particular attention would be given to strengthening
their contractual procedures and practices, especially the inclusion of environmental
performance clauses and penalties in contracts and their enforcement

Environmental Management Plan
This document summanzes the information from the project's Environmental Impact
Assessment, dated January 15, 2003, incorporating additional data collected during project
preappraisal in October/ November 2002
This Environmental Management Plan (EMP) deals strictly with those actions needed to
momtor and mitigate potential negative environmental impacts of the project Actions needed
to ensure or monitor the achievement of project objectives, which are themselves partly
environmental, are detailed m the Project Appraisal Document and Project Implementation
Plan
For ease of reference, and to facilitate monitonng its implementation, the EMP is divided into
the following three sections
A Environmental Mitigation Plan

YEMEN: SANA'A BASIN WATER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM
PHASE I PROJECT - ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REPORT
Archaeological Chance Find Procedures
These procedures were developed in accordance with the World Bank Guidelines - OPN 4 11,
"Management of Cultural Property in Bank-Financed Projects," September 1986 - and take
into account the practices of neighbonng countnes, such as Jordan and Lebanon
These procedures will be included as standard provisions in construction contracts to ensure the
protection of cultural hentage The procedures should be directly executed whenever any new
archaeological remains, antiquity or any other object of cultural or archaeological importance is
encountered dunng construction. The required steps are
1 Stop construction activities
2 Delineate the discovered site area
3 Secure the site to prevent any damage or loss of removable objects In case of removable
antiquities or sensitive remains, a night guard should be present until the responsible
authonty takes over.
4 Notify the responsible foreman/archaeologist, who in turn should notify the General
Authonty for Antiquities, Museums and Manuscnpts (GAAMM), the Environmental
Resource Team (ERT) and the local authorities (within less than 24 hours)
5 GAAMM would be in charge of protecting and preserving the site before deciding on
the proper procedures to be carned out.
6  An evaluation of the finding will be performed by the GAAMM  The significance and
importance of the findings will be assessed according to various cnteria relevant to
cultural hentage including aesthetic, histonc, scientific or research, social and economic
values
7 Decision on how to handle the finding will be reached based on the above assessment
and could include changes in the project layout (in case of finding an irremovable
remain of cultural or archaeological importance), conservation, preservation, restoration
or salvage
8  Implementation of the GAAMM decision conceming the management of the finding
Construction work would resume only when permission is given from the GAAMM after the
decision conceming the safeguard of the heritage is fully executed

Yemen: Sana'a Basin Water Management Program
Phase I Project - Environmental Impact Assessment
1. BACKGROUND
1   The Sana'a Basm is located in central highlands of Yemen and includes the Capital City
Sana'a The basin has an area of 3,200 km2 and an average elevation of 2,200 meters above moan
sea level Current population of the basin is estimated at about 1 5 million, of whom 300,000 live
in the rural areas, and the population growth rate is projected to decline from the current 6% to
about 4% by 2030. The basm includes some 110,000 hectares (ha) of arable land, of which about
20,000 ha are irrigated Groundwater is the major source of water in the basin Abstractions began
to exceed recharge during the mid-1980s as a consequence of the rapid urban population growth
and a sharp increase in water use by agriculture, encouraged by the introduction of tube-well
technologies The basm is expenencing a senous depletion of groundwater resources, with an
associated alarming degradation in water quality The situation is further complicated by the
absence of an integrated water resources management plan for the basm, including lack of data,
absence of a regulatory framework to manage the groundwater abstractions and inefficient
irrigation practices Unless action is taken to improve the management of the basin's aquifers,
current levels of water resources depletion will create a crisis in water availability and supply in
the near future In addition, a new Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) has recently been
commissioned to the north of Sana'a, its effluent could provide a valuable water resource, if
public health issues can be avoided The Government of Yemen is well aware of the situation and
is taking steps to address the water resources management issues in the basin
Project Overview
2   To address some of the development issues, the Govemnment and the World Bank have
agreed to prepare a Sana'a Basin Water Management Program The objectives of this proposed
program are to (i) increase both the quantity and the usable life of the groundwater resources
available for domestic and industnal use in the basin, and so to postpone the date at which the new
supplies have to be brought in from outside the basin; and (11) simultaneously increase the
efficiency of agricultural water use, so as to allow time for a gradual shift to a less water-based
rural economy in the basin
3   The Sana'a Basm Water Management Program will be implemented through an Adaptable
Program Credit (APC), financed by the International Development Association (IDA), a part of
the World Bank Group This would allow IDA and the Government of Yemen to agree on a long-
term (15 years) program to be implemented in three consecutive phases, of which the proposed
project is the first phase. Each phase would be built on the experience and progress of the
preceding one and startmg only after certam milestones have been met In this first phase (five
years), technological solutions and institutional arrangements will be tested on a pilot basis in four
representative sub-basms for later incorporation into a full-scale basin-wide program to be
implemented during the subsequent two phases.
4   The objectives of the Phase I pilot project of this Program are to (i) test and develop demand
and supply management methods for large-scale implementation throughout the basin during the
subsequent phases of the program; (n) make a number of existing dams safe, (m) establish the
regulatory, legal and institutional framework needed for more sustainable water resources
1



management in the Basin, and (iv) carry out the preparation of the Phase II project' of the
Program
EIA Objectives
5   Thc objectives of this EIA are to meet the requirements of Yemeni law and the World
Bank's OP 4 01 by (i) examinmng the environment issues and impacts associated with the
water resources, irrigation and agncultural strategies, policies, programs and projects in the
basin, (n) evaluating and comparing these impacts agamst those of possible alternatives, (in)
assessing legal and institutional aspects relevant to the issues and impacts, and (iv)
recommending broad measures to strengthen environmental management in the sector In
addition, a separate social assessment has been made, covering issues such as attitudes to
water, gender roles, and, possible resettlement issues2.
6   Thc EIA evaluation team consisted of Dr Robert A Boydell (Team Leader), Dr Amin
Abdullah Al Hemyari (Pest Management Specialist), Dr Abdul Karim Nasher (Biodiversity
Specialist), Mr Saba Taher Al Suleihi (Cultural Heritage Specialist), Mr. Khalid Yasin Al
Dubai (Public Health Specialist) The Dam Safety Expert, Mr Mohamed Mahir Iskandar, also
made valuable contributions Dr Peter Whitford assisted with the final editing
The Bank's Safeguard Requirements and Guidelines
7   The Sana'a Basin Water Management Project has been designated as Category A and S 1,
requiring a full environmental impact assessment, in accordance with the Bank's Operational
Policy 4 01, because of the environmental sensitivity of the proposed components, the
diversity of their potential impacts and the associated social nsks Also, because of the number
of environmental and social safeguard policies that need to be reviewed including Natural
Habitats (OP 4 04), Pest Management (OP 4 09), Involuntary Resettlement (which includes
involuntary land acquisition) (OD 4.30), Cultural Property (OP 4 11), and Safety of Dams (OD
4 37) These Operational Directives and Policies are triggered mainly by the proposed
construction of dams and other water retaining structures and changes of agricultural practice,
which may necessitate land acquisition, impingement on natural habitats and cultural property
and the incrcased use of pesticides

2. INSTITUTIONAL ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Introduction
9   A number of institutions at both national and local levels, both governmental and non-
governmental, are involved in the project These are summarized below. The institutional
situation in the water sector in Yemen is fluid at the present time, with thc ongoing discussion
of establishing a National Water Ministry after the elections proposed for April 2003, and the
uncertain location of the mandate for rural water supply This section should be read with the
understanding that changes may take place in the coming months
Ministry of Electricity and Water
10 The Ministry of Electricity and Water (MEW) had overall responsibility for the
development and operation of water supply and sanitation services In the past it created two
organizations that worked independently of each other the General Authority for Rural
Electricity and Water (GAREW) and the National Water and Sanitation Authority (NWSA)
GAREW was established in 1992 and is responsible for planming and implementing the water
supply in rural areas, with populations up to 30,000, but was abolished in April 2001 by
Presidential Decree and its mandate was passed on to the Ministry of Local Administration
(MLA) MEW has also established a Secretariat for Water Sector Reform, initially targeting
the urban sub-sector
National Water and Sanitation Authority
11 The National Water and Sanitation Authority (NWSA) has a mandate for planning and
implementation of water supply in urban areas with populations over 30,000, plus sanitation,
mainly sewerage The formation of NWRA in 1995, with its water resources management
function, was recognized to be only part of the solution to improving the water and sanitation
sector The need for improving service delivery of urban water and sanitation services was a
high priority The responsible agency - NWSA was seen to be weak, very centralized, poorly
staffed, had overlapping responsibilities, poor coordination with other agencies, weak financial
management, and paid lip service to decentralization of its 22 branch offices
12 MEW, with the support of GTZ, established a steering committee for water sector reform
and a supporting technical secretanat A policy and strategy study for future reform was
commissioned and produced a report in September 1996 Based on the principles that water
should be managed as an economic good and managed at the lowest appropriate level, the
report recommended the sector reform should have four main objectives (i) decentralization
of the water supply functions; (n) ensunng that water supply is affordable and sustainable, (iii)
increasing the coverage of sewerage and sanitation, and, (iv) increasing the efficiency of
service delivery through the involvement of the pnvate sector In parallel with this, GTZ and
the Netherlands bilateral aid agency had been taking a practical lead in piloting reform in the
urban water and sanitation sector through working directly with selected NWSA branches and
improving their efficiency and autonomy
13 The Urban Water Sector Policy Paper, which was approved in November 1997 through
Cabinet Resolution 237 "General Principles and Objectives for Water and Sanitation Sector
Restructuring," endorsed the four strategic cornerstones set out in the policy paper The
Cabinet Resolution also set out a process for establishing Regional Water Corporations and the
reformation of NWSA HQ into a policy and regulatory body in a two-stage process First,
decentralization and delegation of authonty to branch offices of NWSA within a three-year
3



time penod Second, the establishment of Regional Water and Sanitation Corporations and the
restructuring of NWSA HQ to become the regulatory body for the Regional Corporations, to
be implemented on the basis of studies that would be carried out in the near future The Sana'a
Branch of NWSA has been restructured into a Local Corporation and is presently soliciting
bids from pnvate enterprises to enter into a lease management contract of the Corporation
Recent senior staff appointments and the drafting of a new rural water supply strategy seem to
indicate that NWSA may well take over the mandate for rural water supply and sanitation after
the disbanding of GAREW, although the situation is not clear
National Water Resources Authority
14 The National Water Resource Authority (NWIZRA) has responsibility for the integrated
management of all water resources in Yemen NWRA was formed in response to Presidential
Decree 154 of 1995 Much of the responsibility for strengthening NWRA has been placed on a
UNDP Projcct, YEM/97/200 "Sustainable Water Resources Development", which is a follow
on to an earlier project, YEM/93/010, "Strengthening Water Resources Management
Capability" Thc project is executed by NWRA and supported by two cooperating agencies,
FAO and UNDESA, and was planned to run for five years starting in January 1997 It has a
direct budget of $9 8M funded by UNDP, the Netherlands and GOY In addition, parallel
financing of $3 6M has been dedicated to the project by the World Bank from the Talz Water
and Sanitation Project ($2.4 m) and the Land and Water Conservation Project ($1 2 m)
15 In November 1998, with the assistance of two short term international consultants
provided by the World Bank, NWRA formulated a draft national water strategy which was a
positive step in institutional and regulatory reform The World Bank's paper "Towards a
Water Strategy" was a contribution to support this process The Bank proposed an action
agenda including (i) macro measures (pncmg, public expenditures, action on qat), (n)
improved sector management (restructuring, water conservation and a regional approach), (nm)
local level solutions, and, (iv) institutional development (national water strategy, water law,
capacity building) However, NWRA has been slow in finalizing the strategy Nevertheless, it
is clear that it has an important role to play in the future, which should be well focused in the
areas of policy development, public information, basin planning and monitoring, support to
investment planning, regulation and enforcement NWRA has commenced a process to
establish a fully functioning Sana'a Branch that will play an important role in this project
Ministry of Local Administration and Local Councils
16 This Ministry was promulgated in August 2000 in the framework of the GOY's
decentralization policy The MLA is an umbrella ministry for the govemorates, district
authorities and municipalities MLA is the channel for funding and establishing policy and
operational guidelines The govemorates themselves have a dcgree of autonomy and have
works departments, which construct and operate water supply schemes amongst other things
With the disbanding of GAREW, the mandate for rural water supply and sanitation was given
to MLA, however they were reluctant to take this responsibility and recent strengthening of
the NWSA by new senior staff seems to indicate that it will take over the rural water supply
and sanitation mandate Local Councils can play an important role in the project
Theoretically, they coordinate all the inputs from the vanous sectoral agencies within their
area They provide the interface between Government and the community by providing
information both upwards and downwards and most importantly they represent the views and
needs of their constituents Whilst working with a community, the local council should be the
first point of contact

Ministry of Public Health and Population
17  The Ministry of Public Health and Population (MHP) deals with health and population
issues throughout the country There has been an increase in the number of health facilities in
Yemen since the 1970s However, this increase has not been able to meet the growing demand
of an ever-increasing population For the rural population, the urban bias of resource allocation
and the decline in the economy has exacerbated the situation Aware of its weaknesscs, the
MHP has developed a strategy paper on reform of the health sector which is in line with the
national reform process that calls for decentralization of power to the lcvel of the
administrative district (MPH, 1998) Population issues and affairs have recently been added to
the mandate of reformed Ministry of Public Health and Population
18  The MHP is responsible for conducting malaria and bilharizia eradication campaigns,
through separate groups. The malaria campaign program was established in 1940 in Aden and
in 1978 in Hodeida After umfication of the country in 1990, the headquarters of the program
was relocated to Sana'a. Until 1992, the program's activities were confined to the diagnosis
and treatment of positive cases The activities were then expanded to include control measures
Activities were stopped during the period 1996-2000, but resumed in March 2001 The total
staff of the program is 42 persons The malaria program campaign carnes out studies on the
distribution of mosquitoes to assess their abundance; measures for eradication of these insects,
studies on the malana parasite, which is mainly Plasmodium spp and their prevalence among
patients, and preparation of epidemiological studies of the disease to determine the major
factors responsible for the prevalence of the disease in endemic areas The group confirms that
malaria is not contracted from mosquitoes breeding in the Sana'a Basin
19 The bilharzia and infectious disease control program center was established in 1973
Despite the importance of this disease for Yemen, the group is weak and the number of staff
members has fallen to only seven persons. They are responsible for field activities as well as
laboratory work, which includes examination of urine and stool samples brought in by the
patients, and preparation of reports on all cases Members of the Bilharzia campaign group
have prepared a complete plan for periodic field surveys of the existing dam sites in Sana'a
basin and water bodies to determine the extent of the snail vectors of Bilharzia They are still
awaiting a positive response from the MHP regarding funding However, their laboratory
activities continue to operate smoothly
Environmental Protection Authority
20 The Environmental Protection Authority under the Ministry of Tourism and Environment
(formerly the Environment Protection Council), was originally established under a goverming
Council of Ministers The EPA has recently been restructured to fall under the MTE and a new
chairman has been appointed This new, stronger organization will have representatives at
Cabinet level and an advisory council The EPA's function is to work in multiple sectors with
the concerned agencies establishing environmental standards, norms and legislation It also
assists in enforcement of legislation through its association with the police and other
regulatory bodies. The former Council was mstrumental in drafting the National
Environmental Action Plan for Yemen in 1996 Although the EPA is not a strong
organization, it has received support from the UNDP (and others) through Project
YEM/97/100 Community Participation in Land Resources Management
5



21 The EPA has recently published (October 2002) a proposed Environment and Sustainable
Development Investment Program for 2003 to 2008 The program sets out prioritized actions
for habitat and biodiversity conservation, land, water, waste, and energy management, plus a
program of institutional and policy development The EPA is now seeking the support of
donors for the projected budget of some US$38 million
Northern Development Authority
22 The Northern Development Authority (NDA) was established in 1988 to supervise and
execute various developmental projects in Sana'a, Saa'da, Hajja, and Al Mahweet
Governorates A number of branches were established throughout the four governorates The
headquarters or General Directorate is located in Sana'a The total number of staff employed
by the Authority is some 900, of whom 260 are based in the General Directorate The
Irrigation Department has 36 employees engaged with various water projects, including the
construction of dams in the Sana'a basm The NDA's activities have included the construction
of dams in various regions (twenty dams have been constructed in the Sana'a Basin (Annex6),
construction of water pipe systems in Sana'a, Saa'da, agricultural extension, drilling of wells
for drinking and irrigation; construction of dnnking water projects, supervision of plant
protection projects, and related activities Dam specialists in NDA indicate that dam
construction projects have caused a number of environmental changes These changes cover
wide areas, extending from the dam location to the impounded water surrounding areas These
changes have both direct and indirect impacts on the environment, mainly duc to the increased
agricultural activities in which local farmers improve large areas of land for agriculture use at
the expense of natural habitats The staff of the NDA have raised this issue on many
occasions, but have had no response from the concerned ministries
Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation
23 The Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation (MAI) oversees a sector that represents 93%
of Yemen's water withdrawals and hosts a number of departments that are of importance to the
project
24 General Directorate for Irrigation The title of General Directorate for Irrigation (GDI)
is somewhat misleading The main function assumed by the directorate is the identification,
design and construction of dams, other activities in the field of irrigation are limited Irngation
design and implementation is mainly undertaken by regional development authorities and
other decentralized branches of MAI supported by external support agencies GDI is supported
by a technical assistance team of experts m dam design and construction Administratively, the
PMU for the Bank-funded Land and Water Conservation Project falls under GDI Recently
GDI has formulated a plan for institutional restructurmg which would create a new General
Authority of Irlgation and Hydraulic Structures The proposed physical and managerial
reforms focuses on decentralization and differentiation between the supply management
functions (dams) and the demand management functions (irrigation) These proposals are still
being discussed internally and are yet to be approved by the Ministry
25. Agricultural Research and Extension Authority (AREA) The Authonty was established
in 1990 after combining the Agricultural Research Authority of "North Yemen" with the
Directorate of Agricultural Research and Extension in "South Yemen", both of which were
established in 1980s The authority has stations in each of the eight agricultural regions in
Yemen, in addition to five specialized research centers The staff of AREA includes 1,515
persons, 336 are researchers, many of whom have higher degrees The station based in the



northern highlands is engaged in agricultural activities in Sana'a, Amran, Saa'da, Hajja, and
Al Mahweet govemorates AREA's activities in the Sana'a basin are concentrated on plant
production, particularly grapes. There are plans to establish research units in the fields of
genetic resources and the conservation of natural resources (soil, water, and vegetation cover)
The authority is concerned with vanous environmental issues, which include The
deterioration in the quality of certain crops and plants The authority believes that this problem
can encountered by encouraging research in genetic resources and establishing seed banks to
preserve strains of high quality The depletion of water resources, mainly in the Sana'a basin
The authority is highly concerned about this point They believe that serious and instant
measures should be taken to solve this problem One of the solutions suggested by the
authority is the developing strategies for the sustainable use of water resources Soil
degradation due to bad practices by farmers in Sana'a basin as well as elsewhere in the country
which will result in destruction of agricultural lands
26  General Department of Plant Protecton The General Department of Plant Protection
(GDPP) under the MAI has the responsibility for regulating the use of pesticides and plant
quarantine It also has a Biological Pest Control Section that was founded during an earlier
bilateral project funded by GTZ, and it also maintains a pesticides laboratory In parallel, the
Agncultural Research and Extension Authority, also under the MAI, has responsibility for
applied research including developing IPM strategies and extension materials but is severely
restricted by lack of resources In addition, the Faculty of Agriculture (FOA) at Sana'a
University are also conducting research and training in the field of pest control in the Sana'a
Basin Extension services are carried out mainly by the Northern Development Authority,
however, due to the fimcal difficulty the field work is limited.
Agriculture and Fisheries Production Promotion Fund
27 A funding agency established in 1974, which supports the development of agriculture and
fisheries throughout the country by providing grants to farmers and fishermen In particular,
promotes modern irrigation methods and provides incentives of up to 40% of equipment costs
for farmers to install drip irrigation in pilot or demonstration farms of which five are located in
the Sana'a Basin Also, promotes the principles of integrated pest management and provided
small grants to the Department of Plant Protection
General Authority for Antiquities, Museums, and Manuscripts
28 The Authority was established in 1969 under the name "Department of Antiquities and
Manuscripts", and became the General Authority for Antiquities and Manuscripts (GAAMM)
in 1978 The authority works under the supervision of the Minister of Culture, but has its own
budget, president, and staff. It has about 800 staff members working in various fields
(Administrative, Scientific, and Laborers) Among this staff, there are experienced technical
personnel specialized in excavation of archeological sites, maintenance, and preservation of
antiquities GAAMM has a wide range of activities, mainly in excavation for antiquities and
archeological sites as well as conservation of cultural heritage in all governorates of the
country GAAMM also responds to reports of finding of archeological sites or any antiquities
(staff members visit the field and take necessary action) GAAMM actively cooperates with
other governmental agencies including those involved in dam construction, and is willing to
cooperate with the project and to provide consultancy whenever needed

Other Organizations in the Water Sector
29 Organizations active in other sectors but also implementing small rural water supply
schemes include The Ministry of Public Works and Urban Development, implementing labor-
intensive projects, the Social Fund for Development, financing social development with an
emphasis on economically productive activities
External Support Agencies and Non-Government Organizations
30 In addition to the World Bank, other donors working actively in the water sector include
the governments of the Netherlands, Germany and Japan, UNDP and FAO Both UNICEF and
CARE are also active in the sector together with a number of national NGOS such as the
Yemeni Women's Union (Ittihad Nisa al Yemen - Hudaydah), and the Society for the Rights
of the Yemeni Child (Jam'iyah Hoqoq al Tifi al Yemeni). Other NGOs that could play a
significant role in the Project are the National Society for Wildlife Preservation, the Yemen
Biological Society, the Society for Environmental Protection, the Society for the Protection of
Cultural Heritage, and Yemen Without Qat
Private Sector and Community Involvement
31 The vast majority of water supply schemes are community constructed and managed, as
shown by the 1996 Water and Sanitation Sector Study and an inventory undertaken in one
govemorate These schemes are generally simple and comprise of a well and pump with
reticulation to serve one or two villages Water and sanitation committees are often formed
from elected groups of not more than 20 people who oversee the water and sanitation facilities,
their functioning and finance They also check the work of any maintenance staff These
committees are sometimes registered with the Social Affairs Department
3. LEGISLATION AND POLICY
The Environmental Law
32 The Environmental Protection Law No 26 of 1995 is the pnmary legislation regulating
the protection of water, soil and the use of pesticides It also sets out the control measures for
environmentally damaging activities, requiring an EIA process for various kinds of projects,
including infrastructure developments of the kind proposed under the present project3 Law No
26 also established the Environment Protection Council under a Council of Ministers (The
Council has recently become the Environmental Protection Authority -(EPA) and was
restructured to fall under the Ministry of Tourism and Environment) Part 2, Chapter 2, of the
law deals with water resources and land use planning in Articles 6 to 10 Part 2, Chapter 2,
Articles 1 1 to 15 deals with biodiversity and Part 2, Chapter 2, Articles 15 to 22 refers to the
licensing use and storage of pesticides Law No 20 of 1998 concerns Seeds and Agricultural
Fertilizers and Law No 25 concermng the Regulation of Handling Pesticides for Plant Pests
and Law No. 32 Plant Quarantine were enacted in 1999. Following the ratification of any law in
Yemen, an Executive Regulation must be drafted and issued as a decree by the Cabinet This
sets out the practical arrangements and responsibilities for implementing the law and makes it

effective. The Executive Regulations (bylaws) for the Environmental Laws have not been
formulated, which leaves the responsibility for enforcement quasi absent
33 The Pesticides Law aims to regulate the operations of handling pesticides, to regulate
procedures for registration, monitoring, inspection and handling, in order to avoid risks to
human and animal health and the environment and to protect the natural enemies of pests and
other economically beneficial organisms The Quarantine Law aims to regulate the
introduction of unwanted pests into the country The law's provisions call for the
establishment of a committee of specialists under the Gcneral Administration of the Mmistry
of Agriculture, with responsibility for preparing a guide on the registration and handling of
pesticides, then establishing a register and registration procedure for those agencies involved
in the importation dlistribution and sale of pesticides The law also makes provision for the
monitoring of pesticide handling and sets out penalties for any infringements or misuse A list
of pesticides approved for use in Yemen is attached as Annex 3.
Yemen's National Environmental Action Plan
34 In 1996, the Environmental Protection Council, with support from UNDP and the World
Bank, drafted a National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) that identified four main areas of
concern water depletion, pollution and supply, land degradation, habitat degradation, and
waste management Based on this, a priontized long-term investment program was drawn up,
which indicated a shortfall of some US$40 million over and above current donor and domestic
funding This project addresses a number of issues addressed in the NEAP, particularly water
resources depletion and institutional strengthening. Moreover, the project will work closely
with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the successor of the Council
The Water Law
35 Recently, a Water Law was approved by Parliament in July 2002 The long awaited
Water Law fills a large legislative gap in Yemeni Law The Water Law sets out the
responsibilities for managing and planning water resources, their protection and conservation,
and sets out procedures for licensing water use and penalties for contravention of the law The
law specifically deals with the roles and responsibilities of central and local government,
traditional water rights, prionties for use, spate irrigation and groundwater abstraction
However, the law as it stands has a number of flaws, mainly it does not provide for measuring
water abstraction, it does not provide for the levying of water use charges for agriculture, the
law allows for the wells to be constructed up to 60 meters deep without a license and all past
water rights are "grand-fathered". As traditional water rights already exceed recharge by more
than 100% the effectiveness of the law in water conservation is limited at best, Article 49 of
the Law provides for areas to be zoned as "Water Conservation and Protected from Pollution"
It would seem appropriate to zone the Sana'a Basin as protected and draft specific guidelines
for water conservation and use in the area.
36 Following the ratification of any law in Yemen, an Executive Regulation (bylaws) must
be drafted and issued as a decree by Cabinet These set out the practical arrangements and
responsibilities for implementing the law and makes it effective Unusually, Article 126 of the
Water Law states that the Executive Regulation must be passed within six months of the
ratification of the Law An expert committee chaired by NWRA is presently drafting the
Executive Regulations Guidelines and standards for wastewater reuse based on FAO and
WHO standards were issued earlier in 1993 Similarly, standards for dnnking water based on
WHO standards were issued in 1999

Land Acquisition
37 Prior to unification, the ownership of the majonty of land in the South was by the State,
whereas in the North,-the land was owned by tribes or individuals Since unification, Article 8
of the Yemeni Constitution vests ownership of all underground natural resources (including
water) in the State to be held for the benefit of the people In addition Yemeni law (Law No I
of 1995, Appropriation (of Property) in the Public Interest) makes provision for the acquisition
of land and sets out three methods of determining compensation by mutual agreement, by court
order, or by providing an equal alternative site However, there have been a number of cases
were the heirs of individuals or tribes have contested land transfers by "oral" mutual
agreements, which have no legal validity Recent land acquisition for dam construction by GDI
and others (the Social Fund for Development and the Public Works Project) has taken place
through a process of mutual agreement However, the critical step in this process is to have the
agreement on paper signed by all parties and registered at the Civil Registry Office, which in
effect waives the ownership rights of the erstwhile owner and all heirs in perpetuity
4. PHASE 1 PROJECT AND ITS COMPONENTS
Project Objectives and Description
38 The objectives of this proposed program are to (a) increase both the quantity and the
usable life of the groundwater resources available for domestic and industrial use in the Basin,
and so to postpone the date at which the new supplies have to be brought in from outside the
Basin, and (b) simultaneously increase the efficiency of agncultural water use, so as to allow
time for a gradual shift to a less water-based rural economy in the Basin The Sana'a Basin
Water Management Program will be implemented through an Adaptable Program Credit
(APC), financed by the International Development Association (IDA), a part of the World Bank
Group. Thls would allow IDA and the Government of Yemen to agree on a long-term (15
years) program to be implemented in three consecutive phases, of which the proposed project is
the first phase Each phase would be built on the experience and progress of the preceding one
and starting only after ccrtain milestones have been met In this first phase (five years),
technological solutions and institutional arrangements will be tested on a pilot basis in four
representative sub-basins for later incorporation into a full-scale basin-wide program to be
implemcnted during the subsequent two phases. The Phase I project is expected to cost $34 0
million and would be implemented by a number of agencies (described in para 42 below)
39 The objectives of the Phase I pilot project of this Program are to (i) test and develop
demand and supply management methods for large-scale implementation throughout the Basin
during the subsequent phases of the program, (ii) make a number of existing dams safe, (mi)
establish the regulatory, legal and institutional framework needed for more sustainable water
resources management in the Basin; and (iv) carry out the preparation of the Phase II project of
the Program
Selection of Pilot Areas
40 The project was prepared in two stages, the first being a "characterization" of the Sana'a
Basin, based on field surveys and satellite imagery Second, on the basis of the stage 1 project
preparation studies, the pilot areas were selected for the detailed preparation in stage 2, which
will form the basis for project implementation The selection criteria for stage 2 included
10



i) Being representative of the basm/ sub-basin hydrologically
ii) High potential for success in meeting the project goals
in) Favorable environmental impact in the sub basin, particularly
positive impact on aquifer recharge
*  scope for development of supply structures e g, dams
* scope of irrigation improvement and reduction of ground water abstraction
* community participation
These criteria were weighted and applied to all the sub basins identified in the characterization
studies, from this process four sub-basins were selected for detailed studies, these are
i) Western Area Hamdan and Bani Matar Districts, Sub-basins 14 and 15
ii) South Eastern Area Bani Bohloul and Sanhan Districts, Sub-basin 19
in) Eastern Area Bani Hushaish, Bani Al Hanth and Khawlen Districts, Sub-basins 9, 11,
12, and 17
iv) North Eastern Area Nihm and Arhab Districts, Sub-basins 3, 5, and 6
Institutional Arrangements
41 Project Preparation Structure A project preparation team (PPT) has been established,
reporting to the Ministry of Planning and Development (MOPD) to administer, manage and
supervise the various studies and activities undertaken in preparation of the project The PPT
and preparation process is monitored by a Steenng Committee, chaired by MOPD and
comprising representatives of the stakeholders, including NWRA, MAI, NWSA, the Farmers
Union and the World Bank
42 Implementation Arrangements. The institutional arrangements for implementation
include a Sana'a Basin Commission (SBC) chaired by thc Mayor of Sana'a, which was
recently established, with representation of all the stakeholders; this replaces the existing
projcct steering committee during project implementation The SBC could eventually evolve
into a Basin Agency Under the SBC, a Technical Secretariat (TS-SBC) would be established
would have overall monitoring responsibility for the project, includmg financial management,
procurement capacity building and environmental management, through the environmental
resource team The TS-SBC would support the NWRA SB (Sana'a Branch), which would
have responsibility for monitoring, licensing, regulation and enforcement and contain an
Information and Public Awareness Campaign (IPAC) Unit The TS-SBC would also support
the MAI GDI, which would house a small project implementation unit (PIU) responsible for
the supply management component of the project The existing Land and Water Conservation
Project Unit under GDI would undertake the demand management components of the project
The MAI Department of Plant Protection (DPP) would liaisc with GDI and undertake the pest
management program The MHP bilharzia control program would liaise with the TS-SBC and
its environmental resource team.
43 Formation of Water User Associations and Councils. Water Users Associations (WUAs)
would be established around individual or multiple wells Wells are generally shared by
groups of 8 to 64 farmers who shared the mitial investment cost (drilling, head station and
pipes) and who continue to share the operating and maintenance costs The average irrigated
area served by a well is 5 ha This will encourage the beneficiary farmers to share in a rational
manner both the incentives provided by the project and the costs incurred It will also ensure
water savings by all beneficianes A signed agreement between beneficianes would suffice to
11



establish the WUA, rather than a formal creation of the association in accordance with the law
At the level of each village or community, a Water Users' Council (WUC) would be
established to include one or two representatives of each WUA in the village In the case of
large villages, a WUC could be established for every 5 to 10 WUAs A higher Council could
be established at the level of each sub-basin, with representatives from each village WUC
44. At each level of the structure, self-regulations regarding water use and conservation
would be elaborated and agreed to by the members. The project staff would work alongside
the local communities and their representatives, through a consultative process, to establish
each level of the structure and its regulations. These representatives include Sheikhs, village
Ak-ls (Wise Persons) and official representatives of families (delegates to Village Councils )
Relying solely on associations outside of the village and tribal structure could be risky, as
farmers do not always trust these associations Establishment of the WUAs and WUCs would
be the first step in the project implementation and is mandatory before anybody from a given
village could benefit from the project.
Description of Project Components
Component 1: Demand Management and Irrigation Improvement Intervention - $13.2
million
45 At the farm and field levels, there is great potential to improve irrigation efficiency and
water management From the social standpoint, farmers were found to be willing to introduce
improvcd methods, to participate in the initial investment costs and to adhere collectively to
measures, such as limiting irrigation expansion However, it is essential that the project
provide support for subsidizing part of the cost, but most for demonstrating the benefits from
the introduced technologies, as well as for sensitizing farmers and helping change their
perceptions of irrigation It will be essential to work closely with farmers during the project to
ensure success of pilot farms, which will cover some 3,870 ha or 17% of the project area,
particularly to convince the farners to adopt new technology Failure in communications will
have a negative impact Selection of pilot farms should be given close attention to identify
farms that have a good chance of success and whose owners have influence over others
46 From the technical standpoint, the most likely option to succeed is the improvement of
traditional surface irrigation and introduction of modem technology, including drip, bubbler
and mini-sprinklers, through pilot demonstration farms. Traming on the appropriatc use of this
technology, including operation and on-farm management will also be necessary as an
accompanying measure The introduction of plastic greenhouses to reduce crop evapo-
transpiration, to protect from frost and to improve crop management, is another option likely
to contribute to the project goals and to be adopted by farmers, provided that the technology is
demonstrated and the necessary capacity building on its use achieved. The technology is
particularly suitable for vegetable crops and is likely to be adopted in the areas of Bani Assem
(in Alluvium -North zone) and Loloah (In Wadi Harard AlGhayl Zahar zone) Bubbler
irrigation will be introduced in 1,350 ha, drip irrigation in 170 ha, and mini sprinklers and
sprinklers will be introduced in 90 ha
47 Irrigation efficiency is greatly influenced by water losses during conveyance, distnbution
and on-farm application, which is particularly relevant in the Sana'a Basin with regard to
groundwater lmgation Experience from past projects, particularly the IDA-financed Land and
Water Conservation Project (LWCP), proved the technical and financial practicability, as well
as the social acceptance, of introducing water saving measures into the present farning
12



systems. In addition, it proved to enhance crop production and quality and to reduce or even
stabilize the decline in groundwater on a wider scale Evident as it may seem, this was not
possible in the early stages of the LWCP, because of the overall context (traditional practices,
social resistance to modern technology, very low technical capacity and social structure of the
production systems). If these issues are addressed, the Sana'a Basin has the potential for
saving large amounts of water, while improving both the production capacity and the social
understanding of the issue of groundwater shortage
48 In the project area, water conveyance efficiency can be improved from its current 70% to
95% in 45% of the farms (1,742 ha) and from 85% to 95% in 55% of the farms (2,128 ha)
This represents a total saving of more than 5 Mm3 per year, just from the improvement of
water transport in the pilot area of 3,870 ha, the saving represents 17% of the total water use in
this area Some 1,660 ha of existing conveyance will be upgraded and repaired and 600 ha of
new conveyance will be constructed In addition to its potential to save large amounts of
water, generalization and/or upgrading of water conveyance systems presents the following
advantages acceptance by farmers; low cost, well-known to farmers, easiness of installation
and maintenance, suitability to area of mixed crops, etc
49 On-farm water distribution and application will be increased from current levels of 50%
and 30% respectively, with and without pipes for distribution, by 20 to 35%, depending on the
introduced system Considering a conservative mean improvement level of 25%, the resulting
amount of water saving will be around 8 Mm3 per year The combined impact of both
conveyance and application efficiency improvements will result in the gross water saving of
about 13 million cubic meters Assuming return flow from irrigation to be 15%, the net
savings to groundwater will be more than 11 million cubic meters per year This represents a
net total efficiency improvement of 33%, or more than 2,800 m3/ha/year This would be a
good performance indicator for the project.
Component 2: Supply Management and Aquifer Recharge Intervention - $10 5 million
50 The project includes for the construction of three new dams, one cascade dam and
rehabilitation of nine existing dams, to be designed by specialist consultants, plus one new dam
and rehabilitation of two existing dams, to be prepared by MAI GDI, as shown in Tables I and
2 In addition, one or two small dams and /or cascading (check) dams will be considered for
inclusion in the project depending on the available budget Other recharge enhancement
structures, such as an underground dam, spate breakers, artificial recharge, will also be included
to test various recharge schemes
Selection of New Dam Sites and Existing Dams for Rehabilitation
51 The selection criteria for new dams include recharge potential, cost associated factors,
and social/ environmental aspects The criteria for selecting existing dams for rehabilitation are
similar These factors were given different weights according to their importancc The 'social
support' criterion was used as a first screening. Dams which had low or no social support were
eliminated The recharge potential of new dams was evaluated for unconsolidated material in
terms of gram size, thickness, and width as well as for bedrock in terms of fracture density,
open status, and percentage of opened fractures. For existing dams, the current recharge is
hampered by accumulated sedimentation Potential recharge will be increased by desilting were
necessary Tables 4 and 5 below list the dams to be rehabilitated and the new dams to be
constructed The dam safety expert's report is attached in Annex 8. Table 3 indicates the
volume of rock and clay fill required for construction of the new dams and the materials locally

available, as proven by the excavation of trial pits in the proposed quarry sites which were
chosen to cause least environmental impact and minimum rehabilitation needs

Component 3. Institutional Development and Community Participation - $4 5 million
52 Training and extension on water use in agriculture are an integral part of the project The
project strategy includes human rcsources development, through training of farmers and
technicians on technical and managenal aspects of irrigation An important program on
training, demonstration, sensitizing and awareness creation will be elaborated around the pilot
farms throughout the project duration (five years). Traimng of farmers will focus on improved
technical practices and on-farm water management that lead to improved efficiency and
increased water savings It is necessary that participation of the different socio-economic
groups in this trainung be ensured. Farmers' training would take place mainly in the field, in
pilot farms and participating villages Exchange of visits between participating villages will be
organized. Study tours for farmers from non-participating villages will take place in the pilot
communities, as part of the preparation for the following phases Project technical staff and
national resource persons, assisted by experienced international specialists, will develop further
the farmers' training programme and deliver it according to a plan that will be elaborated in the
early stage of the project implementation
53 The short and intensive training for engineers, technicians and extension staff would take
place mainly locally, by national and intemational experts and consultants The latter would
develop further the training program and deliver as required in the course of the project
execution Post-graduate traimng and study tours would be organized locally and abroad,
depending on the local capacity to deliver such high level training adequately
Component 4. Information and Public Awareness Campaign - $1.4 million
54 Farmers in the project area realize the water crisis in the Basin and have witnessed the
continuous decrease in groundwater levels They have also been subjected to the consequences
of this decrease, notably greater water scarcity, and the resulting impact on increasing pumping
costs Groundwater level decline ranges between 1 and 9 m per year, with a mean of 4 m per
year in the visited villages. When farmers were asked about their perception of solutions to the
problem, the first solution cited by them is to construct more dams Thls vision actually stems
from that of decision-makers, politicians and technicians, whose campaigns and discourses
during the past ten years have focused on the subject of dams, as the logical and natural solution
to the problems of water shortage In such an environment, the perception of farmers is
understandable To change this vision of the problem and its possible solutions, there is a need to
convince politicians and decision-makers about the right options In this regard, the role of
15



information and sensitizing at all levels cannot be emphasized enough A well designed and
implemented campaign should be the first step of the project and should continue throughout thc
project execution. It will be targeted at decision-makers, politicians, technicians and farmers
55 The situation is somewhat different with modem irrigation technology particularly
localized irrigation With the exception of a small number, farmers are not convinced that such
systems can supply enough water to cover the crop needs and ensure normal crop production
Many farmers, however, are willing to provide pilot plots wherc such systems can be installed
for demonstration purposes Once farmers see the results of these pilots, they will consider
adopting them Without such demonstrations, very few are willing to take the risk adopting them
because of the apprehension that they would lose the production of one growing season It is
therefore of extreme importance that (i) the pilot plots are well designed, installed and managed,
and (ii) a campaign of information and awareness is centered on these plots Another obvious
point of concern for the information and awareness component of the project is the fact that
groundwater is not infinite and is subject to depletion The perception of plenty prevails and
many farmers think that if they could drill deeper, they would find more water The public
consultation process that has taken place and the plans for future consultation are dcscribed in
Chapter 13
Component 5. Environmental Management Plan (EMP) - $1 3 million
56. This component would implement the recommendations of the EIA - see Chapters 8, 9
and 10 and Tables 16, 17 and 18
Component 6. Project Management and Monitoring - $2 4 million
57. This component would monitor the implementation of the EMP
Component 7. Preparation of Phase II - $0 7 million
58 An updated regional EIA will be part of Phase II preparation
Waste Water Treatment and Reuse
59 Earlier, consideration was given to including an additional component to upgrade the
Sana'a WWTP, to ensure that effluent and sludge qualities are suitable for reuse However,
feasibility studies and designs still need to be completed for these works, so it has been agreed
that they will be financed under the Sana'a Water Supply and Sanitation Project, through
suitable cross-conditionality
5. ENVIRONMENTAL BASELINE DATA
Sources of Information
60 A number of preparation studies were undertaken from which the EIA draws data and
information These include Satellite Imagery, Social Assessment and Rapid Rural Appraisal,
Wells and Dams Inventories, Basin Characterization, Supply Management and Aquifer Recharge,
Demand Management and Irrigation Improvement In addition, other specialized studies were
carried out including, sampling of the effluent and sludge at the WWTP, a survey of pesticides
and fcrtilizer use, a dam safety review and a survey of biodiversity and possible sites of cultural
heritage at the potential dam locations Studies carried out by others were also reviewed, which
16



provided valuable information, and a number of pnncipal informants were interviewed to solicit
their experience and opinions
Basin Characterization Studies - Physical Environment
61 The Sana'a Basin (Map 1) is located in the western highlands of Yemen. It is a plain
surrounded by mountains on the west, south and east and covers about 3,250 sq km There is
significant variation in altitude from north to south, between 1,900 and 3,700 m above sea level
The predominant climate is and Although the southwestern parts of Yemen receive significant
rainfall in spring and summer, precipitation is reduced as the winds pass over the high peaks of
the western slopes and plateau areas and, by the time the winds reach the intcrior zone, they are
too dry for any major rainfall events For centuries, the population in the region relied on shallow
wells in the alluvial deposits of the basin for their water needs However, the 1960's saw the
introduction of deep boreholes and diesel pumps and, by the early 1970s, the mining of water in
the shallow alluvial sediments was exhausting this resource The 1970s saw the construction of
boreholes in the deeper sandstones in the Wadi Dahr and Wadi Assir areas The construction of
the first boreholes in the western well field by NWSA to serve Sana'a was a major factor in
accelerating the depletion of the aquifer In less than ten years, water in the basin was being
mined at the rate of 100 Mm3/year for irngation and domestic use in Sana'a City In a reccnt
study (SAWAS), the annual abstraction is estimated to be 200 Mm3/year whilst the recharge
from precipitation is estimated to be 35 Mm3/year However, the recharge mechanism is complex
and difficult to model
62 In contrast, the water table under the city of Sana'a is stable or rising in some areas The
rapid population growth and increasing consumption of water for domestic, commercial and
industrial use and the resulting wastewater discharge has resulted in the recharge of the aquifer
under the city However, most of the recharge, estimated to be some 15 Mm3/year, is through
cesspits and is highly polluted Leaking pipes within the limited sewerage system and industrial
wastes add to the pollution Around the periphery of the city, a number of borrow pits or small
quarries have been excavated to serve the building boom. These pits have become a focal point
for the dumping of solid wastes and vacuum tanker wastes drawn from the cesspits The hydro-
geology of the basin is complex and descnbed in some detail in the WEC project preparation
report, suffice it here to say that the Tawilah or Cretaceous sandstone, which outcrops over 15%
of so, of the northern part of the basin and is thought to reach a thickness of up to 500 m in the
south where it is protected from erosion by overlying tcrtiary volcanic formations, is the main
aquifer of concern
Hydrology
63 The basin catchment is semi-closed with surrounding mountains except at this outflow zone
of Al Khand, along the northern boundary. The basin can be divided into two hydrological units
(Al Kharid and Musayreka hydrological units), or 22 sub-basins on the basis of surface water
drainage systems and topography The long-term average precipitation is about 190 mm with
rainfall occurring in two seasons, a short season from March to May and a long season from July
to September. The sporadic showers result in the rapid generation of runoff that floods down the
wadis in the mountainous terrain Because of this process, the low permeability of the soil and the
high evaporation rate resulting from low relative humidity and high temperatures, infiltration into
the soil is low and limited to flat areas, agricultural terraces and reservoirs Precipitation over the
basin is the only source of water It is estimated that as much as 90% of this returns to the
atmosphere as direct evaporation The remaining 10% constitutes the only potential useable water
resource and is the origin of surface water and groundwater The total mean annual runoff is
17



estimated at about 29 Mm3 (Mosgiprovodkhoz, 1986) On a yearly basis, the actual volume of
runoff varies enormously, as a result of high vanability of precipitation
64 Traditionally, farmers have devised a complex system for water harvesting and
conservation. These systems of terraces and runoff collection prevent soil erosion, enhance water
storage in the soil and use by far the largest share of water, before it reaches the wadis or the
aquifer In addition to upstream water harvesting and conservation, floods are diverted from the
wadis for spate irrigation of small patches of land However, over the past thirty years or so,
groundwater extraction in the basin has dramatically increased and has been severely disturbing
the balance between natural recharge and use, and causing a rapid decline in the aquifer levels
Some regions have been affected more than others but, throughout the basin, there is evidence of
rapid depletion, as a result of both the expansion of irrigated agriculture and the increasing need
for drinking water supply for Sana'a City The total number of wells in the basin is estimated to
be around 13,500
65 The amount of groundwater recharge in the basin has been the subject of great debate The
estimates vary between a maximum of 63 Mm3/year and a minimum of 24 Mm3/year A detailed
charactenzation of the aquifer system of the basin, based on the available data and information,
has been conducted as part of the project preparation studies (WEC, 2001 ) Present recharge
from precipitation is estimated at 3-4% of the total rainfall Recharge also takes place from
irrigation return flows, estimated to be between 15 and 20% of the amounts applied This would
amount to approximately 35 Mm3/year Some rechargc also occurs through infiltration of waste
and sewage water in the city of Sana'a and is estimated to be about 6-7 Mm3/year The total
recharge is cstimated at about 100 Mm3/year, including recharge from irrigation Estimates of
water use in the year 2000 are 200 to 210 Mm3 for agriculture, 38 Mm3 for domestic supplies and
3 5 Mm3 for industry The total is about 250 Mm3 The annual deficit (total use minus total
recharge) is therefore estimated at 150 Mm3/year This indicates a rapid depletion of groundwater
storage and that the aquifer will be depleted in twenty or thirty years unless drastic measures are
taken
66 The issue of the ground water recharge mechanisms has also been subject to some debate
The deposits in the middle and upper reaches of the wadi have high permeability, however, the
estimated run-off volumes in the upper reaches of wadis is quite low, some 0 2 Mm3/year
Traditionally, farmers have made good use of multiple spate check dams approximately 2 m high
that provide both a series of infiltration points down the wadi and take off points for irrigation
water Whereas, in order to obtain the optimum recharge, valley dams should be located as far
downstream as possible in a wadi, to take advantage of the maximum catchment solution In Wadi
Hadran, the catchment and recharge potential for the deep aquifer was small
Cropping Patterns
67 According to 1986 data, agricultural land accounts for 193,700 ha, over 60% of the basin
area, of which 7% is irrigated and 14% rainfed, the remainder being pasture and terraces. The
other 127,160 ha or 40% is rocky unproductive lands A dramatic increase in the irrigated area
took place over the last 20 years, from an estimated 3,000 ha in the early 1980s to an estimated
23,380 ha in 2000 This expansion has occurred mainly on the relatively flat areas, i e the lower
wadi zones and the alluvial plain, where both cultivable land and water are available Although
traditional rainfed crops such as sorghum, maize and cereals are still dominant in the basin, there
has been a large shift during this period to much more remunerative cash crops, such as qat, grape,
vegetables and fruit trees on the newly irngated area The shift from traditional rainfed agriculture
to cash crops came as a result of the high demand for these crops, particularly in Sana'a City
18



which experienced a rapid population increase Recent data indicates that 47% of irrigated land is
given to qat cultivation, 35 % to grape, 16% cereals and vegetables, and 2% fruit trees
Water Quality
68 A survey of water quality carried out in 1995/1996 by SAWAS sampled water in 77 hand-
dug wells, between 20 and 100 m deep and 248 boreholes, between 100 and 400 m deep Table 4
sets out the results of the tests, which indicate that generally the water quality is suitable for
irrigation As would be expected, the quality of the water in the shallow wells was poorer than the
deeper boreholes Biological testing and test for pesticides residuals were not carried out; however,
in a number of boreholes and, in particular, in shallow wells, the levels of chlorides (Cl), sulphates
(S04) and nitrates (N03) exceed the WHO standards for drinking water (recommended limits for
Cl are 250 mg/l, for S04 250 mg/l and for N03 50 mg/I) About 35% of shallow wells exceeded
the limits for chlorides, whereas all of the boreholes were below the limit

69  A further 125 water quality tests were taken in the project area by the project preparation
consultants to evaluate the suitability of the groundwater for irrigation Concentration of dissolved
substances can increase in the soil as water is evaporated These salts can harm plant growth,
particularly in soils of low porosity and where flood irrigation is practiced and ponding takes
place The suitability of irrigation water is usually estimated by calculating the Sodium Absorption
Ratio (SAR) Although the majority of the water quality test indicatcd medium salinity, only 7 of
the 125 samples indicated a high SAR hazard. Generally, thc water was deemed to be suitable for
irrigation, particularly in the freely draining soils of the project area and when drip irrigation is
practiced The only exception to this is adjacent to the Waste Water Treatment Plant were farmers
use the effluent for irrigation, a number of shallow wells exist in this area Samples of the efflucnt
indicate that viable helminths and pathogenic bacteria (Annex 11) are present that exceed Yemeni
and WHO standards for irrgation
70 Additional water quality tests of a sample of shallow wells in the project area were recently
undertaken during project preparation. Table 5 summarizes the results The tested parameters
indicate that, chemically, the wells meet WHO standards for drinking water However, the
presence of low levels of coliform bactena indicate a degree of pollution that is not unusual in
open wells in an agricultural area, where pollution is common from surface sources of animal and
human wastes Although the quality of water for drinking is questionable without disinfection, it is
19



highly improbable that any transfer of biological pollution to the lower aquifer could take place
This is confirmed by recent isotope tracmg that indicates that the recharge rate of the lower fossil
aquifer takes many tens of years, durnng which pathogens could not survive

Existing Dams
71 An inventory of some 44 dams in the Sana'a Basin has revealed that approximately 25%
require urgent rehabilitation to ensure their safety These dams which are earth or rock fill, some
with concrete or rip rap faces, ranged from 12 to 25 meters in height, the oldest was built in 1985
The dam safety report is in Annex 9 It was also noted that most of the dams suffered from
siltation In a number of existing dam sites that were inspected, silt had built up over the years to
more than three meters thick which effectively minimized the possibility of groundwater recharge
Where silt had been removed, it provided a good soil conditioner that was used on cultivated land
Table 6 below estimates the number of persons who would be displaced if dam failure took place
and the potential risk factor Table I lists the charactenstics of the 11 dams that require
rehabilitation Table 14 summarizes the findings of the EIA on potential environmental impacts of
each of the proposed new dams and summanzes proposed mitigation measures

Biological Environment
72 Yemen is very rich in flora and has a wide range of natural vegetation types, a mixture of
species from East Africa, the Sahara-Arabia, and the Mediterranean In the Sana'a Basin, trees are
rare, other than those in the lower wadis, which are mainly Acacia origena (and those being
cultivated commercially) The vegetation coverage ranges from 9 to 43% and is dominated by
grasses and dwarf shrubs, mainly the herbaceous Andropogon spp Precise data on the status and
number of rare and endangered plants in Yemen are not available, however, some 8 species (7
from the island of Soqotra are listed in the IUCN Red Book), plus some 19 additional species are
considered endangered at the national level. Medicinal flora is not well documented in Yemen and
research on the subject is limited, however, medicinal and aromatic plants are of great interest to
rural Yemenis
73 Yemen has a population of 71 recorded land mammal species including bats Five species of
gazelle have been recorded, four of which are believed to be almost extinct in the country Other
species are ibex, oryx, baboon, red fox, wolf, hyena and jackal Amongst the most notable is the
Arabian Leopard, which is considered endangered or already extinct and the cheetah, which has
not been seen in the wild since 1963. Yemen is very rich in bird life and more than 350 species
have been recorded The presence of a wide variety of habitats and strategic positioning at the
transition of three geographic regions make the country an ideal stopovcr in the flight paths of
migrant birds, notably birds of prey and waders.
74 The major threats to flora are non-project related cultivation and poor agricultural practices,
wood cutting for timber firewood and charcoal, over grazing, soil salination, wind erosion and
expansion of villages and cities Similarly, the major threats to fauna are non-project related, i e
over hunting, killing of animals perceived as dangerous such as snakes, and destruction of habitats
through deforestation and urbanization Regarding bird life, the creation of water bodies through
the construction of dams will have a positive impact on both native and migratory species
75 Field reviews of flora and fauna were made at each of the proposed new dam sites, including
interviews with nearby residents. No rare or endangered species of fauna were encountered or
reported. For flora, a specimen of a succulent plant (Kleinia pendula) was found in the vicinity of
the proposed Bahman dam site, though not in the immediate construction area While this species
is rare in the Sana'a Basin, it is described in the literature as "tolerably frequent" (i e not rare or
endangered) in other areas of Yemen4 Field tests by one of the authors (Nasher) show that this
species can be successfully transplanted Proposed mitigation measures are set out in para. 117
No other rare or endangered species of flora were found

Pesticides Use
76 A number of pests occur in the biological environment Pest infestation causes substantial
annual losses of crop production ranging from 20 - 70%, depending on crop type and location
Some 115 species of pests have been recorded in Yemen. Major pests of epidemic proportions are
the termite, which can reduce the maize crop by 40%, and thrips that can reduce banana
production by up to 70% Other notable pests are the sorghum midge, white fly, aphids and army
worms Agricultural crops are also subject to a number of plant pathogens A field survey was
carried out in July 2001, with eight locations selected for sampling, representing the four pilot
sub-basins of the Sana'a Basin Bani Husias, Hamdan, Arhab and Nahem Five farmers were
randomly chosen to be interviewed in each area.
77 The survey indicated that the main pests in the Sana'a Basin attacking qat and grape, the
main irrigated crops in the area are powdery mildew, downy mildew, mealybug, scale insects,
jassid green worm and spiders Farmers claim that, in the past, pest problems did not exist and
only in recent years, after the introduction of synthetic pesticides, have the pest problems appeared
and that it was getting worse year after year The interviews revealed that farmers in Sana'a Basin
utilize several pesticides, such as dimethoate, diazinon, methiodathion, triforine, fenarimol,
penconazole, traidimefon, propineb, fenarimol hymexazol, metalaxyl and tridemorph However,
dimethoate and penconazole were found to be widely used and highly preferred by farmers in all
sub-basins Most farmers had little idea of recommended dosages Farmers used their own
judgment based on their experience of trying several pesticides and dosage rates, which ranged
widely between I to 2 kg or 1/ hectare Most farmers revealed that they apply pesticide three to
four times for each crop Others stated that they spray more than that if the pest persists The qat
growers, for example, mentioned that they can manage to increase qat production and harvest
three to four times a year through the application of more pesticides, fertilizers and intense
irrigation. However, some traditional agncultural practices remain, the most common of which is
crop dusting
78 Table 7 shows the quantity of pesticides and fertilizers imported to Yemen dunng the past
five years through official channels, however, pesticide smuggling is rumored to be common This
increase is due to the expansion of cultivated land, especially, for qat plantation, and the higher
frequency and heavy dosage of pesticides

79 A study by the Yemeni/German Plant Protection Project (Salman, 1993) undertook blood
tests for Cholinesterase (an enzyme) Inhibition, which is an indicator of organophosphorus
pesticide poisoning. A sample of 288 farmers and sprayers, pesticides shopkeepers, habitual qat
chewers and a control group were tested. The study found that there was a high level of exposure
to poisoning, particularly within the farmer sprayers and qat chewing group, shop keepers were at
less risk. More than 60% of habitual qat chewers displayed enzyme inhibition but were not
22



interested in trying to find untreated qat, or qat that had not been sprayed for more than two weeks
and washed Similar levels of enzyme inhibition were seen in the spraying group The major
symptoms being suffered were headaches and tiredness In other studies, pesticides residue has
been found in milk and on fruit
Social and Economic Environment
80 The Sana'a Basin is one of the most heavily populated areas of Yemen, as it incorporates the
national capital and nine rapidly growing rural districts surrounding the urban center The local
people belong to the two largest tribes in Yemen, the Hashed and the Bakeel The Social
Assessment found three main groups of stakeholder farmers in the rural areas of the basin First,
traditional farmers whose shallow wells have been depleted and now exploit the deep aquifer in
order to preserve their livelihood Communal deep boreholes are drilled by groups of farmers
ranging from 5 to 50 members, pumping time is allocated according to the contribution to the
borehole cost The poorer members could have as little as 30 minutes per week, whereas the richer
members could have 2 full days per week. Second, new entrepreneurial farmers, who use their
economic social or political position to invest in highly remunerative speculative agriculture,
mainly qat Third, landowners who have abandoned agriculture as their primary source of income
and develop and sell water to the rapidly expanding nearby urban water market
81 The continuing fall in the water table and increase in drilling and pumping costs have
increased the costs of water, which in turn has encouraged farmers to increase the production of
qat in order to cover their sunk costs The main risk in this trend is that larger farmers will
monopolize water and just produce qat whilst smaller farmers in zones not suitable for qat
production will become marginahzed and may have barely enough water for subsistence farming
The relationship between Sana'a City and the surrounding rural areas is clearly based on physical,
socio-economic, institutional and political interactions The driving forces behind these
interactions are the availability of land and water, and commerce Farmers are aware of the risk of
losing water in the deep aquifer but blame NWSA (now the Sana'a Local Corporation) which
operates 12 boreholes in the area to serve the city of Sana'a and the rich land owners who also sell
water to the city The rural population sees the use of boreholes and water allocation as a force for
socio-economic differentiation between rich and poor, and urban and rural In light of these
considerations, it is important to serve the needs of all stakeholders, including the smaller farmers
whose survival depends on access to water
Rapid Rural Appraisal
82 A Rapid Rural Appraisal and a number of stakeholder meetings were undertaken during
preparation in order to establish a better understanding of the socio-economic conditions in the
basin, and the concerns of the communities regarding water and potential for their participation in
the project. The Sana'a Basin has been divided into six natural agricultural rcgions, each of these
was visited and questionnaire surveys undertaken with individual farmers, both well owners and
water buyers, and with separate groups of male and female farmers Basic information was
solicited, together with more specific data on water use, problems and conflicts and water
management The results of the appraisal are detailed in the WEC Report In Table 8 are statistics
of water use and well sharng

Well pumping               Range 0 3 - 24 0 hours/day  Average 10 4 hours/day
Farmers' Desire to Increase Irrigated Area
83  The appraisal also shows clearly that, in the rural areas surrounding Sana'a, access to water is
not equitable About 28 percent of farmers do not have access to irngation water, and 72 percent
hold farms partly rainfed and partly irngated from wells The appraisal found that all categories of
farmers would try to use additional water, if and when made available to them, for irrigation to
reduce the risks of uncertain production and increase their incomes by extending the cultivated
areas Sixty percent of respondents declared they would extend their cultivated area and adopt
morc profitable crops

85 The most common infectious diseases in Yemen include diarrhea and dysentery, typhoid,
acute respiratory infection, and malaria There are no specific population-based data on the
morbidity and mortality of the communities living in Sana'a Basin However, clinic-based data
shows that the areas around the Sana'a Basin reflect the national pattern

86 As can be seen from the tables above, many of the predominant diseases are water and
environment related Therefore any water, sanitation and environmental improvements linked with
behavioral change through education and awareness raising, could have a dramatic impact on
morbidity and mortality, particularly in children Malaria is water related, as the mosquito vector
breeds in water Some 11,140 cases of malaria were recorded in January to May 2001 in the
Sana'a Basin, 2,079 in the pilot areas. Malaria parasites usually cease to develop at altitudes
higher than approximately 2,000 meters The high incidence of malaria in the Sana'a Basin, which
is higher than 2,000 meters, is explained by the regular movement of people from the surrounding
25



low lands where the infection was contracted Viable malaria vectors are also thought to be
inadvertently imported from lower lying areas in trucks or containers
87. Schistosmiasis, or Bilharzia as it is commonly known, is not altitude sensitive and is
prevalent in areas around the Sana'a Basin, where some 2,075 cases of both S mansoni and S
haematobium were recorded in the Sana'a Basin during the same period in 2001, 341 of which
were in the pilot areas Bilharzia is also water based, the parasite breeds in an aquatic snail host
and penetrates the skin of those wading or swimming Creation of new water bodies and channels
can exacerbate this problem It is notable that, after the construction of the Marib Dam, although
of a much larger scale and in a different location, infection rates rose from less than 5% to more
than 45% The snail host is very hardy and can survive for many months dunng the dry season in
the reservoir sediments, re-emerging and shedding ova during the following rainy season
88 The effluent being discharged from Sana'a Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) also
causes a public health nsk, samples indicate that a number of pathogens are being discharged into
the adjacent wadi including a number of helminth ova and cysts (Amoeba, Giardia, Taenia
sagmnata Ascaris, Schistosoma, and Ancylostoma duodenale), plus pathogenic bacteria, including
Salmonella, Shigella and Streptococcus The sampling also indicated that the treatment process
had little effect in the reduction of helminthes The sludge produced by the WWTP also contained
similar concentrations of pathogens, however, in dned sludges between 6 and 12 months old,
almost all pathogens were no longer viable In an study (Nasher 1997) carried out in the area of the
old waste stabilization ponds, water samples were taken from two wells approximately 150 m
from the wadi through which effluent was flowing The analysis identified four bacterial species
including E coli, which indicates pollution from the effluent In parallel, stools from 145 pupils of
the local school were examined for intestinal parasites, 22% were found to be infected with
Giardia, 36% Entamoeba coli, 34% Entamoeba histolica and 5% were infected with various
helminths A more recent analysis of the effluent from the new Sana'a WWTP was carried out by
WEC from the University of Sana'a a summary of which is shown in Table 12 below As can
readily be seen the presence of pathogens contravenes the Yemeni Standards for irrigation water
Full details of the analysis are given in Annex 10.

Urban Domestic Water Supply
89. Much of the water is provided by private vendors who operate boreholes and maintain local
water reticulation schemes, collecting revenue from their clients In other situations, water is
delivered to households in water tankers that in turn fill household storage tanks The tanker
drivers obtam the water from borehole operators within the city limits or from boreholes in the
pern urban areas. There is a general understanding that groundwater in and around Sana'a is likely
to be polluted to some degree and the majority of the middle class use bottled water for drinking
purposes However, it was recently reported in the press that the city authorities had closed down
thirty-five water bottling plants and confiscated ten thousand bottles for health reasons. The water
had not complied with Yemeni water quality standards published in 1999
Rural Domestic Water Supply
90 In the Sana'a Basin, most water (80 - 90%) is used conjunctively for both agricultural and
domestic purposes The Social Assessment found that almost 50% of drinking water is drawn
directly from a borehole, whereas, in only 20% of cases, had some form of reticulation to
households been constructed and, in a further 20% of cases, surface wells had been constructed
exclusively for domestic (drinking) use. The construction of public stand posts is uncommon and,
where piped systems had been constructed, they were in a poor state of repair The main causes
for concern was polluted water, non-functioning systems and long distances to a water sources
Rural Sanitation
91  Sanitation in the Sana'a Basin reflects the national picturc, in which only 18 8% of thc
households have cesspits and 15 5% have buckets, while 52 4% of the households disposed of
their sewage in the open air and 7 2% used toilet connected to open dramage Sewage disposal in
the open air can pose potential public health risks Flies can digest or pick up pathogens and
transmit infectious diseases to the household members. Sewage disposal in the open air or to open
drainage could also lead to contamination of groundwater when the feces are drained by heavy
rain to the aquifer The problem is not just the households' low income but it is also lack of
awareness amongst householder members of how diseases are transmitted In rural areas,
households tend to value the availability of water without much value for sanitation As part of the
awareness raising, there is a need to show villagers how to construct appropriate septic tanks or
cesspits. The awareness raising should be culture specific, touching upon the daily life of the rural
community in a way that influences and changes their behavior Particular attention should be paid
to the safe disposal of feces and urine for the control of bilharzia. Eggs passed in the urine and
feces of an infected person contam a larva which hatches when in contact with water After
leaving the intermediate snail host, the free swimming larva can survive for 48 hours and seeks to
penetrate the skin of man, after 30 to 40 days, the cycle repeats itself.
27



Sewage Disposal in Sana'a City
92 Sewage disposal systems in Sana'a City can be classified into off-site and on-site disposal
The off-site disposal consists of a piped-sewage system which is connected to some of the
households in the city In this system, the sewage is transferred through a sewer network to a
treatment plant located to the north of Sana'a City The sewage is then treated in mechanically
operated aeration tanks, followed by maturation ponds The effluent is discharged to an adjacent
wadi, where it is used by local farmers for the irrigation of crops Problems in the operations of
the WWTP are described elsewhere, and the public health issues arising from the effluent
discharge are described below On-site disposal is practiced by households in areas not connected
to the piped-sewage system. These households individually construct their own septic tanks
outside the buildings, often to a substantial depth These pits are sometimes not well constructed
and collapse causing a health and safety hazard The pits also have public health and environment
risks by leaking into broken water mains and contaminating the underground aquifer Some tanks
are emptied by vacuum tanker when full and the wastes are disposed of indiscriminately in any
convenient nearby wadi, causing a public health and environmental risk
Sana'a Waste Water Treatment Plant Operation and Reuse
93 Sana'a WWTP suffers from poor performance and operations due to a number of factors,
including poor design and inefficient operations A number of particular problems have been
identified (i) inadequate sludge drying and disposal, (ii) discharge of raw sewage into the adjacent
wadi, (iii) inconsistent effluent quality, and (iv) foul odors emanating from the WWTP The
design quality standard for the treated effluent was set at a BOD of 30 mg/l and SS of 30 mg/l
Sludge production was estimated to be some 570 m3/day In reality, the incoming sewage was
found to be much stronger, the incoming BOD average is almost 200% higher than anticipated
Similarly, the SS average is 140% higher than planned The present incoming flow rate averages
26,900 m3/day or 53% of the anticipated ultimate design capacity Because the strength of the
incoming sewage is twice that anticipated, almost the full capacity of the WWTP is being used to
treat 50% of its design flow in terms of BOD removal The major concern is that the incoming
effluent often bypasses the plant and is channeled directly into the adjacent wadi, which creates a
serious surface and groundwater pollution problem Also, large volumes of partially treated
sewage sludge are stockpiled at the plant It is estimated that some 100,000 cu m of sludge arc
presently stockpiled A rapid environmental assessment of the WWTP is attached as Annex 9
94 The effluent is presently used by some 600 farmers in the area, who have formed a union for
the irrigation of some 280 ha of various crops through an informal system of channels and
portable pumps This poses considerable health risks to both the farmers and consumers of their
produce  The farmers themselves complain of damaged crops, soil degradation and health
problems, including skin lesions. The public health risks of the present effluent discharge and
sludge are described in para 84,8.
Groundwater Pollution from Sana'a Waste Water Treatment Plant
95 A recent study (Yassen et al, 2000) of pollution from the WWTP sampled wells up to 2 km
from the outfall of the plant Table 13 compares well water quality with the effluent from the pond
adjacent to the plant The high salinity of well water as indicated by the electrical conductivity
(EC) and the total dissolved solids (TDS) show that groundwater pollution is taking place in the
area surrounding the WWTP This was confirmed by positive tests for coliform bacteria in the
wells The high salinity suggests that salt resistant crops should be cultivated in the area
28



Moreover, the relatively high concentration of chloride and boron are borderline against FAO
standards for imgation water and should be monitored to ensure that metal toxicity does not occur
in the crops

Cultural Environment and Heritage
96 The Sana'a Basin area is situated in thc middle of the highland plateau, which is an area that
has been populated through history and has been the stage of many episodes of the country's
history since pre-Islamic times The City of Sana'a, found at the center of the basin, has been the
capital of Yemen smce its pre-Islamic days Like many other parts of the country, this area is
believed to store invaluable treasures of the nation's hlstory that are yet to be revealed The city of
Sana'a itself is nick-named Madmat Saim, the City of Shem (son of Noah), thus attributing its
foundation to Shem, ancestor of the whole Semitic race In this context, and according to
traditional historians, Sana'a was the first city to be rebuilt after the Flood, becoming, therefore,
the oldest living city The legendary palace of Ghamdan is certainly buried here, we are told by
traditional sources It is largely accepted that many of the buildings, monuments and relics of the
past remain undiscovered due to the little archeological or historical research that has been
undertaken
97 However, this archeological wealth is evident in the numerous known sites, such as the fort
of Ghayman at Bani Buhluil, southeast of Sana'a, attributed to the Sabaean King Asad Al-Kamil or
the mosque of Asnaf in Khawlan Many other sites contain important structures that are buried
underground but known to be there An example of such sites is the ancient Cathedral of Sana'a,
Al-Qalis, attributed to the famous A D 6th century Axumite Abrahah, which is located in the Old
City of Sana'a Another example is the underground channels of Sana'a that brought fresh water
from the north and south of the city for centuries, and some of which remained functional as late
as the early 1970s
98 An important aspect of the richness of this area remains evident in the living traditions of the
people and their arts, vernacular architecture, lifestyles and techniques Their learming and
knowledge about the environment and developing resources available to them have left
unmistakable impressions of their struggle for survival on the environment The age-old
mountain-side agricultural terraces, water cisterns and irrigation systems are silent witness to the
29



long relation between the people and the environment, which has become characteristic of their
culture.
99 Culturally, important sites that may suffer from infrastructure projects necessitated by
development are not limited to monuments or sites with historic or religious value but extend to
cover habitual spaces of a daily-event character. Examples of such elements are the community
gathering spaces that have acquired the sense of place through ritualistic use and the individual
dwellings with certain special or unusual characteristics. It is worthwhile to mention here that the
Yemeni people regard their hentage with great respect and take pride in their ways of life and
traditions, which they believe have been handed down to them from the honorable ancestors The
memory of the Marib Dam and the legendary gardens of ancient Yemen are a source of assurance
and hope for the people of Yemen It is commonly believed that the great ancestors were blessed
in their land with the gift of rain and the genius to build a dam system that managed that heavenly
gift
100 As the dam sites are located in isolated areas where no habitation or social activities exist,
there is little danger of harm to any structures of cultural heritage importance While Sana'a City
is rich in cultural heritage, the rural areas also contain valuable ancient terraces, water cisterns and
irrigation systems However, field inspections of each of the proposed new dam sites (Annex I)
found none of these5 and no other visible ancient remains or locations of importance in local folk
tradition The possibility of buried sites or artifacts is dealt with in para 118 Some old dams and
old irrigation and diversion structures exist in the wadis, mainly downstream of and beyond the
construction zone of the new dams, which may have some histoncal and cultural value
6. ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIAL IMPACTS
Environmental Assessment Category
101 The Bank requires an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of projects proposed for
Bank financing to help ensure that they are environmentally sound and sustainable and thus to
improve decision making The Borrower is responsible for carrying out the EIA This EIA, carried
out on behalf of the Borrower, evaluates the project's potential environmental risks and impacts in
its area of intervention, examines project altematives, and, identifies ways of improving project
design and implementation by preventing, minimizing and mitigating the impacts Given that
prevention is preferred over mitigation, some of the mitigating measures have already been
incorporated in the project design
102 Application of the Bank Environmental and Social Safeguard Policy OP 4 01 led to the
determination that the Sana'a Basin Water Management Project has been designated as a Category
A and S1, requiring a full environmental impact assessment, for a number of reasons (i) the
number of safeguard policies triggered, (n) the difficult to predict impacts of intervening in a
complex surface and groundwater regime, at present not being managed in a sustainable manner,
(iii) the inclusion of dams in the investment program, albeit fairly modest structures, and (iv) the
complex social issues of water management in Yemen Also, the changes m agricultural practice
that may require land acquisition and increased use of pesticides Other public health issues have
also been identified "Yes" in the table below indicates that the policy is triggered and requires
close examination and mitigation.

103 The policies on Natural Habitats and Cultural Property are not considered triggcred by the
proposed project, as identified potential impacts are limited in their scope Field surveys
encountered only one rare species of plant, which would be transplanted if encountered during
construction There are no known archeological sites near the proposed work sites Provisions for
chance archeological finds are spelled out in Appendix A
EIA Approach, Scope, and Methodology
104 This EIA has been prepared in parallel with and benefited from the project preparation
studies This EIA considers the natural environment (water and land), human health and safety,
and social aspects of the proposed intervention It reflects the country conditions, particularly the
limited baseline data and information, and the country's overall policy framework, national
legislation, and institutional capabilities related to the environment and the proposed project
105 The environmental team undertook detailed field surveys of the proposed dam sites and
surrounding areas A limited survey of farmers' practices and use of pesticides was also
undertaken In addition, the team reviewed the extensive documentation available, including
previous reports and studies prepared by Italconsult, Mosdgiprovodkoz, and SAWAS Interviews
were conducted with all the stakeholders, including the local communities and farmers and a
number of principal informants (listed in Annex 13) The consultation and disclosure meetings are
described elsewhere in this report The EIA was unusual and innovative in that, throughout the
study, the team worked in close liaison with the project preparation team, in order to cnsure a
seamless understanding of the issues being addressed. Given the spatial dimension and complexity
of the water issues in the Sana'a Basm, it was essential that the EIA was conducted as an integral
part of the project preparation process
106 Special attention is given to pest and pesticides management. In accordance with OP 4 09,
the Bank supports projects that adopt pest control through Integrated Pest Management (IPM)
approaches that may include a combination of biological control, cultural practices, and the use of
crop varieties that are resistant to pests The use of pesticides can only be supported when their use
is justified under an IPM approach and when WHO standards are adopted
107 A number of Bank guidelines were consulted, including, Pollution Prevention and
Abatement Handbook, Occupational Health and Safety Guidelines, the Environmental Assessment
Sourcebook, and the Participation Source Book Moreover, the Environmental Assessment is
designed to meet the requirements of Yemen's Environmental Protection Law, No 26 of 1995 and
the Waste Water Reuse Guidelines of October 1993.

7. PROJECT ALTERNATIVES
Broad Alternatives to the Project
110 In the course of the EIA, the followmg alternatives were considered. Their overall
environmental implications are noted
(i) Do Nothing The "do nothing" alternative - that is allowing groundwater and water
quality levels to decline further - has obvious negative economic and social
consequences. Needless to say, the environmental consequences would also be
disastrous - rapid depletion of both the shallow and the non-renewable deep aquifers,
pollution of both aquifers from surface sources and cross-connection, and increasing
salinity of the groundwater resource. If unchecked, these impacts would be
increasmgly difficult and expensive to reverse
(ii) Importing Water from Outside the Sana 'a Basin. Options range from water transfer
from basms adjacent to Sana'a to desalinated sea water - a distance of about 200 km
and an elevation change of 2,200 m Cost for trans-basui transfers range from about
US$ I / m3 to about US$ 8 / m3 - desalination and lifting to Sana'a. Even the lower
end of this range is likely to be unaffordable for Yemen in the foreseeable future The
nsk for political and social conflicts, especially for transfers from areas where water is
already used, is high. This has been demonstrated elsewhere, notably in Taiz (Taiz
Water Supply Project). Environmental impacts from any trans-basin project, involving
reservoirs, pipelines, canals and pumping stations, would likely exceed those of the
selected project.
(iii) Top-Down Approach to Water Resources Management. Community involvement in
water resources management is difficult and time consuming, and outcomes may differ
from what planners predict. Hence, a more top-down approach was considered for the
proposed project. It was rejected, due to the following findings from sector work, other
projects and from expenences elsewhere in Yemen (a) in Yemen only local cormmunal
institutions have shown potential for success in groundwater management; (b) water
management institutions have to include, in one form or another, all those who have
water rights, perceived nghts and therefore an interest in water management, and (c) a
'top-down' central institution may have some impact as an 'umbrella' or framework for
regulation, but only if it responds to the demands of broad-based stakeholder
organizations As top-down solutions tend to be more capital intensive and less
concerned with better management of existing assets, the environmental impacts of
such an alternative would likely be more severe than for the selected project.
111   The selected project is to be preferred to any of the above alternatives in terms of
environmental impact. The EIA then reviewed alternatives to the selected project components
35



Specific Alternatives to Project Components
Component 1: Demand Management Interventions
112   The financial and economic benefits of irrigation improvements are more readily
quantifiable and greatest emphasis should be placed on this component. Demand management and
irrigation improvements, mcluding water quality, are essential in arresting the decline of the water
resource. Other radical alternatives, such as curtailing the abstraction of water in certain areas, is
socially untenable in the short term. The social dimensions of the project are clearly a key to its
success. Public awareness, farmer education, health and hygiene education should be considered
as essential components of any alternative mixture of project activities Similarly, the institutional
and regulatory components of the project are essential elements The uncontrolled dnlling of wells
and expansion of farming has been one of the root causes of the present situation and the issue
must be addressed if any improvements are to be made.
Component 2: Supply Management
113. The trade off for the project is to establish the balance of investments between dam or
recharge structures construction and irrigation improvements and this will vary for each of the sub-
basins The financial and economic benefits of irrigation improvements are more readily
quantifiable. The benefits of dam construction as a means of aquifer recharge are difficult to assess
because of the complexity of the physical processes mvolved The issue of the groundwater
recharge mechamsms has been subject to some debate In order to obtam the optimum recharge, a
valley dam should be located as far downstream as possible in a wadi to take advantage of the
maximum catchment. Three potential dam sites were visited. In Wadi Bahman, it was found that
the although the recharge potential was good, the runoff and geotechnical conditions may not favor
a valley dam and a senes of check dams may be more appropnate. Similarly, in Wadi Al Sinn, the
recharge potential was good, however, the runoff is likely to be limited and a series of check dams
may be a better solution. In Wadi Hadran, the catchment and recharge potential for the deep aquifer
was small. Therefore, dam construction should be limited to areas where the geology and
geography suggest that the investment would be worthwhile and the effectiveness should be closely
scrutiuzed An alternative to constructing three of four substantial dams would be to construct a
series of small check dams along the length of the wadis in the pilot areas thereby preserving the
traditional spate imgation systems and minimizing the downstream effects. Dam inspections took
place during project preparation and clearly the safety of existing dams is an issue that should be
addressed within the project as they present a hazard, albeit small, to the local population Any
existing dams in the project area in danger of collapsing or over-topping dunng flooding should be
made safe, and any other unsafe dams throughout the basin should be brought to the attention of
GDI and the Panel of Experts
114  In conclusion, the EIA was not able to identify alternatives to the present project
components with significantly different potential environmental impacts
36



8. ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION PLAN
Supply Management and Recharge Improvement Component Related Issues
115. Dam Design Issues. These relate mainly to the dams to be constructed under the Supply
Management Component and their access roads. Sites for new dams have been selected taking
environmental impacts into account. Access roads should be sited to avoid settlements, cultivated
lands and terraces, cultural property and valuable ecosystems and to minimize visual impact They
should also be designed with adequate drainage and controls on erosion. Existing quarries and
borrow pits would be used where possible, or new facilities would be sited so as to avoid cultural
property and valuable ecosystems, to mimmize hydrologic and sediment impacts, as well as visual
impacts New dams will be designed, and existing dams would be rehabilitated, to meet accepted
international design practices for dams of this type and size6
116 Dam Construction Issues. The short-term environmental pollution risks and worker health
and safety needs associated with the construction phase of the project will be mitigated through a
number of measures, most of which would be stipulated in the terms of contract with the
construction enterpnse. Compliance with these measures will be the responsibility of the TS-SBC,
which will supervise the works. Non-compliance will be penalized through invocation of penalty
clauses  For all project works under components 1 and 2, quality assurance plans should be
prepared pnor to construction The contractor(s) will progressively rehabilitate the work areas to
ensure that disturbed sites, which are susceptible to erosion, will not remain exposed for long
penods Sites will be restored to their original contours and revegetated where directed To ensure
their health and safety, workers will be provided with safe dnnking water and sanitation facilities,
suitable clothing, first aid posts and training in safe work practices.
117 Any rare or endangered plants (such as Kleinia pendula (para. 75)) or arnmals which might
be affected by construction would be transplanted or relocated to safe locations, as directed by the

118 While no visible archeological sites or artifacts were identified (at the dam sites) during the
EIA inspections, the possibility of chance finds remams in a culturally nch environment like
Yemen, especially during excavation under Components 1 and 2 Appendix A (Main Report) sets
out the proposed provisions to be included m contract documents to deal with such events They
call for the cessation of construction while the find is reported to GAAMM, who will decide on the
appropriate procedures to be followed, including removal or preservation. Changes in project
layout could result in some cases. Whlle the procedures of Appendix A are somewhat ahead of
previous practice in Yemen, they mirror current practice in neighboring countries. The project
would thus serve as a model for upgrading Yemen's procedures In addition, any ancient terraces
or structures adjacent to project works would be protected from damage and plundermg for rock
119 The irrigation component will involve only small-scale construction, such as trenching for
laying pipelines Shonng may need to be provided in deeper trenches to ensure worker safety
Component B will involve heavier construction and a series of measures should be taken to
minimize impacts7. A dam construction manual, now under'preparation, should be completed pnor
to the start of dam construction. To reduce noise, work should not be undertaken between 9 pm
6 For example, US Bureau of Reclamation, "Design of Small Dams", Sherard "Earth and Earth Rock
Dams".
They should be considered also for Component A on a case by case basis.

and 6 am  Worksites, quames and access roads should be watered as needed to suppress dust.
Additional noise and dust suppression measures should be taken for quarnes and stonecrushers,
especially if located near inhabited areas Asphalt and concrete batching plants should provide
controls to reduce air pollution and pollution of surface and groundwater Fuelling should take
place at least 100 m from watercourses or recharge areas, controls to prevent spillage should be in
place and contractors should be equipped to clean up any accidental spills Strict measures for the
transport, storage and use of explosives should be in place.
120. Resettlement Issues. Of the social safeguard policies, only that on resettlement (OP 4.12)
is tnggered, with regard to the land acquisition issues related to impoundments In the majonty of
cases, the land to be flooded would be "common land", not used for productive purposes and
owned by the community In only one case has a home of eleven persons been identified, on the
margins of a reservoir, that would require relocation. Nevertheless, there may be cases when
individually owned land may be inundated, in which case GDI's pragmatic, demand-based
approach for 'land acquisition' would apply GDI traditionally responds to a community demand
for dam construction by a survey of the area, identifying the land that would be flooded The
communities and responsible local councils internally discuss and agree on compensation (in most
cases a substitute land area) and sign a tnpartite contract (community, council, GDI) that no
compensation from Government is required This contract or letter of agreement is registered at the
Civil Registry Office'. The land contribution constitutes the community's share towards the
construction of the dam and the benefits derived from it If no agreement is reached, no dam is
built. This policy has been in force since 1994 and has so far never led to a dispute It is therefore
highly unlikely that there would be involuntary resettlement in the project for the five new dams
Land issues for the rehabilitation dams were settled during their onginal construction. If there are
conflicts with downstream or adjacent communities they must reach a documented agreement on
allocation of water rights before GDI would commence construction of the dam
121 A resettlement policy framework and a land acquisition assessment for the five new dams
have been drafted. For the expected situations described above, the framework requires a remedial
plan, containing mformation and sketch maps of the land to be acquired, an enumeration of
persons affected, a table of compensation entitlements (and venfication of their availability), a
timetable, organizational and financial arrangements, and consultation and gnevance procedures.
Such plans will be made publicly available in Arabic and shall be approved by the Bank pnor to
the execution of sub-projects tnggenng OP 4 12 (paras 20 and 21 of Annex y) The 'framework
also provides for the case that there is involuntary resettlement or other significant or large-scale
impacts, by specifying a full Resettlement Action Plan, as required by OP 4 12
122 Operational Issues. No operational issues were identified with respect to the Irrigation
Component, as its effect will be to improve irmgation efficiency and, by replacing open ditches
with pipes, reduce disease vector habitat. The proposed pest management activities (para 126)
8 The following is a translation from Arabic of the form used by MAI to reach agreement with the
communrty/land owners regarding contnbuting land for dam construction. The form is signed and dated by
representatives of MAI and the commwuuty "We the undersigned and owners of this land declare that our
land can be used for the implementmg of this project An agreement has been reached with the Mmustry of
Agnculture and Irrigation declarng that we are ready to give up our land for the establishment of this
project. This agreement includes giving up the lake, rocks, soil, and water and anything else located on the
land that can be of use for project implementation. We also declare that we will take full responsibility of
constructing a road through which cars trucks and other project requirements could utilize at our
expense"

will counteract any tendency to increase pesticide use following irrigation improvement For the
Supply Component, operational issues are mainly covered in the section on Dam Safety below In
addition, reservoirs should be desilted durng each dry season to restore recharge capacity
Agreements on minimum monthly releases downstream of dams (probably in terms of penods of
opening of outlets) would be made by the farmer groups to protect the traditional rights of
downstream spate irrigators. Conditions in the wadi beds downstream of dams would be observed
to identify an undue scouring due to hlgh velocity discharges from dam outlets If necessary,
remedial works, such as check dams, gabions and spurs, would be implemented The siltation of
reservoirs is a problem that should be addressed in the project. In a number of existing dam sites
that were inspected by the Dam Safety Expert, silt had built up over the years to more than three
meters thick, which effectively reduced the possibility of groundwater recharge. Regular desilting
is required to ensure the recharge potential of the dams The silt can be disposed of in two ways,
first by using as a soil conditioner in nearby farms, or second by land filling in depressions away
from the dam site.
123. Safety of Dams (OP 4.37, BP 4.37). The rehabilitation of existing dams proposed for this
project is itself a mitigation measure to address safety hazards Out of 44 dams in the basin, 24
were assessed as needing rehabilitation, of which 11 may pose a senous safety nsk for
downstream populations and require immediate work They were included in the proposed project
after review by a dam safety specialist. Five new dams will be built as recharge structures two
exceed 15 meters (16 and 18 m), two are small dams, and the fifth is a cascading senes of check
structures. In addition, other smaller surface retention, or sub-surface structures will be tested
dunng project implementation. The selection of the dam sites was based on a rapid social
assessment, which determined the level of community demand The new dams and the ones
selected for rehabilitation are relatively modest in size and located in remote and barren areas with
small local populations These dams are intended to be aquifer recharge structures rather than
impounding structures, they are dry for up to nie months a year
124 A dam safety expert has visited all sites and preliminarily concluded that the sites and
foreseen work would not pose any safety nsk However, an international expert will also be
retamed to review feasibility studies, final designs and bidding documents and to participate in the
Mid-Term Review In addition, non-structural safety measures have been recommended and would
be followed up by the implementing agency (MAI GDI), such as mstallation of instrumentation
and monitorng devices, operation and maintenance plans, including emergency preparedness
plans, and establishment of a panel of three national experts, who would supervise final designs
and safety measures A plan for the construction supervision and quality assurance, and an
instrumentation plan have been prepared, together with a preliminary O&M plan The emergency
preparedness plan will be finalized durmg implementation.
125 Sustainability Issues. While the program, of which this project is the first phase, is
intended to promote sustainability of groundwater development by slowing the rate of depletion,
there is ample evidence from elsewhere in the world that when available water resources are more
intensively used, water quality inevitably declmes This is less of a problem for drinking water,
which can usually be treated economically However, water quality is already marginal for
irngation in some parts of the basin due to high levels of dissolved salts Given the complex nature
of the project interventions, their impact on water quality is difficult to predict However, it is
likely that changes should be relatively slow Therefore, it is recommended that the monitoring
program for water quality outlined below and the modeling provided for in Monitonng
Component be used to analyze trends and develop any mitigation measures needed under Phase II
Demand Management and Irrigation Improvement Component Related Issues
39



126 Pest Management (OP 4.09) Pesticides and fertilizers are used freely and increasingly
Even though there is no direct linkage between the rismg use and the proposed project, the EIA
proposes a model Pest Management Plan to be applied in the project pilot areas to the two major
crops - qat and grapes. The inclusion of qat is somewhat controversial; while qat is the
predominant crop in the Sana'a Basin, occupying some 47%, its consumption raises senous
political, social and public health issues Among the latter are risks from the ingestion of
pesticides Reducing the cultivation or consumption of qat is considered to be beyond the scope of
the project However, its consumption could be made somewhat less risky with appropriate
measures to minmize pesticide residues. For both crops, the excessive and improper use of
pesticides will be mitigated through the demonstration of a model integrated pest management
(IPM) plan in the project areas The plan is both a mitigation measure against harm that may occur
from excessive use of chemicals, and a learning instrument for the DPP, who would be in charge
of implementing it, to gain expenence with alternative means to combat plant pests If successful,
it could be replicated for other areas in the basin and the country, as well as for other crops. An
accompanying farmer education program, which will stress good and safe practice for pesticides
application and storage in the field, will be developed. Regular testing for pesticide residues will
be done by the MAI Pesticides Laboratory, which will receive support from the project for
equipment and trainig Furthermore, a program of monitonng the quality of groundwater used by
the farmers in the vicmity of the project intervention will be developed Further details on the Pest
Management Plan are shown in Annex 7 The following would be the mam steps, for the grape
pest management plan, which would start first
(a) Initially, a Participatory Rural Appraisal would be undertaken among grapevine farmers
in the Bani Husheish area to gather information about the crop pests, plant diseases and
present knowledge and practices regarding their control Other social, physical,
ecological, economic and environments data would also be gathered The results would
be discussed with the farmers and a joint action plan formulated
(b) The second step would be the development of an IPM plan, through consultation
between the farmers and outside facilitators The plan would consist of a package of
recommendations for the farmers, including plant protection measures, better agronomic
practices including pesticides use and management as one component of a series of
measures plus improved marketing strategies
(c) Traimng and communicating the IPM plan and its recommendations to the grapevine
cultivators through field days and farmers' field schools would follow this Targeted
groups are extension agents, farmers, farmers' wives, cooperatives, pesticide importers
and dealers. They would be educated about the dangers of pesticides and the safe use of
pesticides, includmg traming of farmers in adequate application techniques and safety
precautions A post-campaign evaluation would be undertaken after one year
(e) A number of supporting activities would be undertaken, including production of
information brochures and posters outlining the IPM plan, plus simplified versions of
the pesticide and plant quarantine-laws and their regulations in a form easily
understandable by the general public. These would be disseminated through various
media, including radio and TV In addition, a mobile information van managed by the
MAI General Department of Plant Protection would tour the area
(f) A new pesticides residue laboratory has been constructed in the General Department of
Plant Protection headquarters in Sana'a City, with support from German bilateral aid
However, the laboratory lacks staff and equipment and additional support is requested
40



for the purchase of some equipment and training of some members. This would enable
the laboratory to be operational at an earlier date and thus to be able to monitor
agricultural crops produced in the area for pesticide residues, thus protecting consumers
and improving pest management practices
127 Health Issues. Schistosomiasis (or Bilharzia as it is commonly known) is a water related
disease spread by a snail that lives in slowly moving water It is not altitude sensitive and is
prevalent in areas around the Sana'a Basin, where some 2,075 cases were recorded during the first
four months of 2001, 341 of which were in the pilot areas There is some danger that its prevalence
could be increased by the project works Mitigation of any potential public health nsks related to
the project will be undertaken by the MNHP Regular inspections of water bodies close to human
habitations will take place to detect and identify the breeding of vectors and contam any colonies
found through controlled spraying of insecticides and molluscicides Bilharzia statistics will be
monitored with close attention to the project intervention sub-basms for any unusual pattern
Monitonng will be on a monthly basis as part of the ongoing effort by the existing clinics and
health facilities in the project area, which will also provide drugs to affected persons A public
health/ bilharzia specialist will join the Environmental Resource Team (para.141) to develop and
oversee heath education and control measures. While cases of malaria are commonly found in the
Sana'a basm, research indicates that these are imported from lower altitudes, as the vector
mosquitoes cannot survive at the basin elevation of more than 2,000 m Thus, the project would
not affect malana prevalence
128. The essential elements of a bilharzia control campaign are (i) tramiing of staff and design of
a health and hygiene campaign, (ni) implementation of a health and hygiene campaign that stresses
safe disposal of feces and urne away from water bodies and that particularly targets schools
children, (ii) regular monitoring of local clinics to detect any increase in reported cases of
bilharzias; (iv) a physical survey of dam sites and canals to detect any concentrations of snail
populations; (v) control of snail populations through controlled spraying of molluscicides, and (vi)
physical control through cutting back water edge vegetation, lowering water levels and flushing
channels When infection rates rise above 30% of samples, the MTP would intervene with drug
therapy
129 In order to reap the social benefits of the project, improve public health and, in particular, to
mitigate against water-based disease vectors, it is essential to improve domestic water supplies in
terms of quality and accessibility and personal hygiene. A campaign to provide increased coverage
of public water supply stand posts and latrines should be launched together with a hygiene
education program that emphasizes safe excreta disposal and hand washing
130 WWTP Issues. As noted above, the design and operational problems of the Sana'a WWTP
pose clear health nsks to the population, both to farmers using the effluent for irrigation and to
consumers of the crops they produce, especially vegetables eaten raw There are also nsks to the
environment - to ecosystems along the wadi and to groundwater quality These problems are most
severe when raw sewage is being bypassed around the plant because of a vanety of operational
problems but, even when the treatment process is working correctly, reuse of the effluent calls for
greater monitoring, education of users and restrictions on the crops grown The present inability to
stabilize and dry the unexpectedly large volumes of sludge is also creatmg an increasingly severe
health and environmental threat, as the partly stabilized sludge has high levels of pathogens As
part of the preparation of this project, a Rapid Assessment of the environmental impacts of the
WWTP (Annex 9) has been made.
41



131 Addressing these issues will require two types of actions. First, short term actions (descnbed
below) have been agreed to ameliorate the immediate problems. Second, the completion of a
detailed WWTP Environmental Audit, followed by (or combined with) the completion of final
designs for and implementation of WWTP improvement works, likely to include increased area of
sludge drying beds; construction of detention tanks to avoid bypassing the plant, primary settling
tanks to reduce the sludge load and odor control.
132 It is expected that the detailed design study for the improvement works will be funded under
the Sana'a Water Supply and Sanitation Project, and that the civil works would be funded from
savings from Arab Fund and OPEC Fund loans. Any shortfall in funding may be covered by the
Urban Water and Sanitation (W&S) APL. An official request from the Government to reallocate
the necessary funds in both the Sana'a W&S and the Urban W&S Projects is required It will be
important to obtain legally binding guarantees under this project that the environmental audit and
plant modifications will take place in a timely manner It has been proposed that the WWA/TP will
be managed in the future through a lease contract It is essential that performance guarantees and
penalties for non-performance be specified in the contract
133. The "short term actions" that could be instituted dunng the first year of project
implementation should include (but not be limited to) the following
* Removal of the accumulated dried sludge within the WWTP to a land fill site
* A "red flag" system to warn farmers when raw sewage is being bypassed.
* Farmer education on the hazards of treated and untreated wastewater, through the IPAC
(para 142).
* A ban on the use of effluent to irrigate vegetables eaten raw (or equivalent actions)
It is noted that actions which restrict the income earning potential of the farmers are likely to be
socially unacceptable.
134  The proposed monitonng program  will provide monitonng of the quality of effluent and
sludge for pathogens, suspended solids and other contaminants Moreover, a study to review the
feasibility of wastewater reuse for restricted irrigation and the use of sludge as a soil conditioner is
presently being undertaken with parallel funding from CIDA. The findings to be published in mid-
2003 will be of great benefit in determining the optimum means for waste disposal and
maintainmg public health.

9. ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING PLAN
135 There is inevitably some overlap between monitonng needed to check the achievement of
project objectives, which are themselves environmental, the implementation of environmental
mitigation measures, and the measurement of trends m environmental status mdicators The
present document aims to cover the second category, with some elements of the third that may be
necessary to check for longer-term impacts. Monitoring measures may be grouped as follows
Water resources, Dam safety; Pesticides; Public Health, WWTP. All monitoring data would be
made available to the public in English and Arabic through a website or on request Details are
provided in Table 16.

Water Quality                    NWRA SB                Lab Tests Quarterly
136. Water Resources. A strengthened system of water resources monitoring would be needed
both to measure the effectiveness of environmental mitigation actions, but also to detect long-term
trends which may mfluence the design of the second phase. For surface water, staff gauges would
be installed at all new and existing reservoirs and read daily Staff gauges would also be installed
in the main wadis and read at four-hourly intervals (if possible) dunng flood events Analyses of
recharge rates would be made for each wadi at the end of each rainy season For groundwater,
additional monitonng wells (piezometers) would be installed throughout the project area and read
weekly The quality of surface and groundwaters would be monitored monthly dunng the growing
season and their suitability for irmgation assessed annually. Surveys of the depth and volumes of
reservoir sediment would be made at the end of each dry season for all project dams.
137 Dam Safety. A detailed monitoring program will be prepared for each dam (new,
rehabilitated and others) during the final design phase by MAI GDI, under the guidance of the
POE This would specify responsibilities, equipment, frequencies of measurements and types of
analyses to be performed Results would be reviewed by the POE annually and by an international
dam safety specialist at the Mid-Term Review GDI would also perform a visual inspection of all
dams twice annually, when full and when dry, and take appropriate follow-up action m case of any
observed problems.
138 Pest Management. Water quality monitorng (para 136) will include annual measurements
of pesticide residues in groundwater. Monitonng of residues in foods and in human blood will also
be made annually. MAI DPP will undertake monthly surveys of Knowledge, Aptitude and Practice
(KAP) with respect to IPM techniques of project area grape and qat farmers during the growing
50



season, in order to gauge the effectiveness of the pesticides program and to make any necessary
adjustments.
139 Public Health. The prevalence of bilharzia vectors (snails) will be monitored annually by
MiHP in all reservoirs and other standing or flowing water bodies The mcidence of bilharzia
infection will also be morntored annually by MHP.
140 WWTP. For effluent leaving the plant, suspended solids and biochemical oxygen demand
(BOD5) will be monitored each three days by the plant Full physical, chemical and
microbiological analyses would be made monthly Dried sludge to be used outside the plant would
be subjected to weekly physical, chemical and microbiological analyses
10. INSTITUTIONAL ACTIONS
141 A number of agencies would be responsible to ensure timely implementation of the EMP -
see Tables 15 andl7 for details Implementation would be facilitated by the establishment within
TS-SBC of an Environmental Resource Team (ERT), consisting of a full-time environmental
specialist, together with "on call" specialists in biodiversity, cultural heritage and other disciplines
as needed. The team would join inspections of dam sites dunng construction to ensure that any
rare flora are identified and chance finds of artifacts properly dealt with

142 An Information and Public Awareness Campaign (IPAC) unit would be established in
NWRA SB under Component 4 of the project mainly to increase public awareness of water
scarcity IPAC would also support the Environmental Resource Team, DPP and MNHP in
improving awareness of the nsks of pesticides, malana, bilharzia and WWTP effluents Support
will also be made available to the MAI DPP and to MHP to prepare detailed implementation plans
for pest management and public health respectively and for the incremental costs of carrying them
out
143. A Panel of Experts (POE) will be formed of Yemeni specialists in dam design, construction
and monitonng - supplemented as needed by international expertise - to review and approve all
designs for new dams and rehabilitation works for existing dams, review specifications for such
works, periodically review construction quality, design and oversee the installation of monitonng
instruments; review and analyze monitonng data, and, visually inspect all dams (new and existing)
at least twice a year.
Continued Public Consultation Mechanism
144 As an extension of the public disclosure principle and practice throughout the project
implementation process, a point of contact will be maintained in the field to where the public may
refer for information or lodge any gnevance or concerns. The public consultation mechamsm will
be maintained by the NWRA SB/TS-SBC and the EPA throughout the life of the project
11. COST OF THE EMP
145 The total cost of the EMP is estimated at $ 1,102,000 base costs. Details are set out in
Table 18, which also gives expected year by year expenditures

12. SUMMARY OF KEY PROJECT BENEFITS
Benefits - Component 1: Demand Management and Irrigation Improvement
146 Direct project benefits would include annual incremental of water saving, institutional
strengthening, awareness creation on water shortage among users and capacity building of farners
to manage water resource use Improvements in efficient use of groundwater would be expected
to
(i)  Lead to gradual transfer of the imgated crops area using traditional systems toward
modem irngation systems usmg less groundwater,
(ii) Reduce pumping costs through savings from piped water distribution and on-farm
application, and
(iii) Reduce labor costs (up to 10 hours per day under LWCP.)
147 Other benefits would include decreases in pumping time and increases in the amortization
of head stations (25% under LWCP), and an increase in the cropping intensity with no incremental
water use and change in croppmg patterns, such as the introduction of crops with higher value
added The combined impact would be the saving of substantial quantities of water at the farm
level and the subsequent reduction in groundwater abstraction. Component 1 will benefit a total
area of 3,870 ha by improved and modern imgation system. The expected volume of saved fossil
water is about 11 Mmi/yr Considering only the pumping cost, which is around YR 19/m3, this
saving is equivalent to 209 million YR (US$ 1.2 mullion) per year
Benefits - Component 2: Supply Management and Recharge Improvement
148 The direct benefits of Component 2 will be an increase in the rate of aquifer recharge from
the 4 or 5 new dams and the rehabilitated dams which, in tum, will prolong the life of the water
resource, allowing more time for a long-term solution to be found Aquifer recharge from
precipitation is very low, the great majority of rainwater is lost to evaporation, and the
construction of dams will sigmficantly increase the recharge potential (Table 19) The second
benefit will be to make safe 11 dams, which are in urgent need of repair thus increasing the safety
and productivity of down stream populations

13. PUBLIC CONSULTATION
The Bank's Public Consultation/ Disclosure Policy and Procedures
149   The main objectives of the Bank's public consultation and disclosure policy, as set out in BP
17 50, is to inform stakeholders and other interested parties of a proposed project, its objectives and
components and to present them with an opportunity to participate in the project design process by
providing both positive and negative inputs and comments, thereby buildmg public confidence
More specifically, the consultation process aims to
* Identify key stakeholders
* Raise awareness of the key stakeholders
* Provide an opportumty for stakeholders to make inputs into the design of project
components
* Highlight public awareness for the project.
* Establish a process and mechanism for future dialogue and complaint.
* Makig public and disseminating the EIA and EMP reports
150. This section sets out the public consultation and disclosure process that has been undertaken
dunng project preparation which has included an initial environmental scoping workshop,
stakeholder and public meetings and interviews, and a consultation meeting at which the findings of
the EIA and EMP were made public The workshops and meetings are summarized below
Summary of Initial Environmental Scoping Workshop
151   A one-day workshop was held on May 6, 2001 with the following objectives. (i) to launch a
process of consultation and public disclosure regarding the project concept and design, (n) to verify
who are the key stake holders; (iii) to make a preliminary assessment of the key environmental
issues to be addressed in the project, and (iv) to reach an agreement on the draft TOR for the EIA
Some forty-five participants and officials attended the workshop, together with press and television
observers In addition, the scope and objectives of the project were presented, together with the
preliminary findings of the Stage 1 Preparation Studies The EIA process, time frame and the World
Bank Safeguard Policies and Guidelines were also set out Three working groups were formed to
identify the benefits and issues that may be caused by the project in the areas of (i) public health,
water supply, irrigation and wastewater reuse, (ii) cultural heritage and biodiversity, and (iii) dams
and dam safety The outputs from the workshop were (i) agreement on the consultation and public
disclosure process; (xi) issues identified that should be addressed in the EIA; and (iii) substantial
inputs to the finalization of the TORs for the EIA A full summary of the workshop and the working
group findmgs is presented in Annex4. It was concluded that the main issues to be addressed in the
EIA were dam safety; public health (including household water supply, sanitation and the Sana'a
WW1TP), blodiversity, cultural heritage; pesticides; monitoring water quantity and quality, and the
involvement of women These should be reflected in the TOR
Summary of Stakeholder Meetings
152   Four stakeholder meetings were held hosted by NWRA, which were well attended my
representatives of the communities in the identified pilot areas, mcluding farmers and community
leaders. The full proceedings of the meetings are set out in Annex 5. The main issues that appeared
56



to be of most concern to all stakeholder groups were discussed in facilitated working groups and
are listed as follows:
* Groundwater depletion scarcity
* Inadequate infrastructure
* Water monopolies
* Interactions between farmers and Government
Specific Issues: A number of specific local issues were raised, including
* Heavy reliance on ram-fed irrigation and pests in Sanhan, Bani Bahloul
*  The need for galvanized pipes in HamdanHigh rock permeability in Bani Al-Hanth
*  Expansion of the city into agncultural land
Perceived Solutons There was a strong consensus that dam construction and rehabilitation, the
adoption of modern irrigation systems, and implementation of an intensive public awareness
program m the rural area are the main solutions to the problem. Recharge dams were known to have
proven effective in several areas (e g. Mukhtan in Bani Hushaysh) and lessons had been learned
This was a strong validation of the project's approach
153   Conclusion. In addition to the main problem of groundwater depletion and lack of
infrastructure, other concerns emerged, the most important of which is the lack of trust between
farmers and Government It is clear that m order to establish a degree of confidence water users
committees must be integrated into both the water management and water policy development
mechanisms of the Government It is also clear that the water management policies and practice
should address the issue of equity and water monopolies Another serious issue that emerged is the
practice of wastewater disposal from WWTP m Bani Al-Harith Participants from this district put
forward some interesting suggestions for handling the situation continuous monitonng on the
wastewater treatment plant operations to ensure that water discharged from the plant is clean and
suitable for imgation use; monitonng the discharge of oil and grease into the wadi channel, and
requinng garages and factones to put all such matenals m special tanks/barrels to be collected later
for proper disposal. Any such monitonng programs are likely to be effective if local mhabitants
from the district are involved directly The other concern that should be noted was the lack of
adequate drinking water.
154. The important role that the Agncultural Cooperative Union (ACU) has played through the
Cooperative Society for Irrigation and Hydraulic Structures was made clear in the meetings This
society has been involved in the construction of three recharge dams (two in Mukhtan, one existing
and another under construction, plus a proposed one (in As Sarf area)) and three reservoirs (one
each in Wadi Sa'awan, As Sir, and Ash Sharya areas) In conclusion, it should be said that the
public consultations through the raising of issues and developing possible solutions validated the
projects concept and approach, and emphasized the need for community participation in the
planning and implementation However, the Government must be seen to be delivenng on its
promises.
Summary of the Consultation Workshop on the EIA and Environmental Management Plan
155. A workshop was held on November 2, 2002, hosted by the Mayor of Sana'a, in the Ministry
of Electricity and Water to present the findings of the draft EIA and the proposed EMP The
workshop was a continuance of the public disclosure policy adopted durng project preparation The
57



workshop was well attended by a broad representation of government agencies, stakeholders and
NGOs Copies of the EIA Executive Summary and the EMP matrix were made available to all the
participants. The Yemeni EPA made a comprehensive presentation of the EIA requirements with
regards to infrastructure projects in Yemen The Project's Task Manager and the Project
Preparation Team Leader made presentations on the objectives and status of the project Tlus was
followed by a presentation from the World Bank's Regional Environmental Advisor on the Bank's
Environmental and Safeguard Policies. The independent Environmental Specialist who had led the
EIA team made a presentation on the findings of the EIA and the proposed EMP. Following the
presentations, an informed discussion took place regarding the findings of the EIA and the
provisions of the EMP. Major issues of debate were
*  the shortcomings of the new Water Law,
*  the need for Improvements to the Waste Water Treatment Plant,
*  the effectiveness of dams as recharge mechanism,
*  the need to restrict the expansion of irrigation,
*  the need to move to rain fed agriculture and a less water based economy,
*  the need of budgets for training and water monitoring; and
*  the need to convene expert groups to consider the above suggestions
156   Before and after the workshop, individual meetings were held with the agencies that would
be charged with its implementation of the EMP to ensure that they were fully aware of and in
agreement with the plan and its provisions Meetings were held with the PPT, MIA GDI, MIA DPP,
NWRA, GAAMM, the WWTP Manager and the Director of the Sana'a Urban Water supply and
Sanitation Project, all of whom were familiar with the provisions of the plan and their
responsibilities. In addition, the mission met with the EPA to discuss its oversight role in the EMP's
approval and implementation In conclusion, it should be noted that a broad understanding of the
EIA and the EMP had been reached by all the concerned parties
157. Future Consultation and Community Interactions A program of future consultations are
planned through the first phase of the project both nationally and at regional level, which will be
programmed by the TS-SBC This will be an important aspect of project monitoring and will focus
on the effectiveness of the information and public awareness campaign in changing farmers'
understanding and practice A further specific consultation process towards the end of the first
phase that focuses on progress and achievements will be an important tool in designing the second
phase project In addition to the consultations, a full time unit will be established which will serve
as a point where farmers can obtain information about the project, discuss concerns and lodge
complaints

APPENDIX A
REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
YEMEN: SANA'A BASIN WATER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM
PHASE I PROJECT - ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REPORT
Archaeological Chance Find Procedures
These procedures were developed in accordance with the World Bank Guidelines - OPN 11 03,
"Management of Cultural Property in Bank-Financed Projects," September 1986 - and take
into account the practices of neighboring countries, such as Jordan and Lebanon
These procedures will be included as standard provisions in construction contracts to ensure the
protection of cultural hentage The procedures should be directly executed whenever any new
archaeological remains, antiquity or any other object of cultural or archaeological importance is
encountered dunng construction. The required steps are
1  Stop construction activities.
2  Delineate the discovered site area
3  Secure the site to prevent any damage or loss of removable objects In case of removable
antiquities or sensitive remains, a night guard should be present until the responsible
authonty takes over
4 Notify the responsible foreman/archaeologist, who in turn should notify the General
Authonty for Antiquities, Museums and Manuscripts (GAAMM), the Environmental
Resource Team (ERT) and the local authonties (within less than 24 hours)
5  GAAMM would be in charge of protecting and preserving the site before deciding on
the proper procedures to be carned out.
6  An evaluation of the finding will be performed by the GAAMM  The significance and
importance of the findings will be assessed according to vanous criteria relevant to
cultural heritage including aesthetic, historic, scientific or research, social and economic
values
7  Decision on how to handle the finding will be reached based on the above assessment
and could include changes in the project layout (m case of finding an irremovable
remain of cultural or archaeological importance), conservation, preservation, restoration
or salvage
8. Implementation of the GAAMM decision conceming the management of the finding
Construction work would resume only when permission is given from the GAAMM after the
decision conceming the safeguard of the heritage is fully executed.
