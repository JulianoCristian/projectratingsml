F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project development objective (PDO) is to increase both the quantity and the useful
life of the available water resources within the Sanaa Basin by increasing the efficiency
of agricultural water use and accelerating aquifer recharge, so as to allow time for a
gradual shift to a less water-based rural economy.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1      Context at Appraisal (brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for
IDA assistance): Yemen has low and limited freshwater availability, with no perennial rivers:
water comes from rainfall, springs, seasonal flash floods (spate), and groundwater. Its
availability of 115m3/capita/year is among the lowest in the world, compared to the already-low
MNA average of 1,250 m3/capita/year. Moreover, this water scarcity is exacerbated by
significant physical and temporal variations and water allocation problems and a rapid
population growth. Unlike the other Arab countries, desalination is not a viable option for most
of Yemen since much of the population lives in the highlands, far from and high above the coast.
In the highlands, groundwater is almost non-renewable (being pumped at an average rate one and
a half times that of natural recharge, and in certain cases this rate is up to four times), and hence
it is quickly declining, as fast as 5 m/year in Sana'a Basin. Water availability in Sana'a City,
capital of Yemen, is one of the scarcest in the world. The option of bringing in water from
outside the basin has been studied, and found highly uneconomical and socially controversial.
Yemen's limited water supply has been rapidly depleted throughout the last 3 decades, due to
expansion of irrigated agriculture, which escalated after introducing drilling rigs and energized
pumps, encouraged by the diesel subsidy, and due to the rise of competing demands from urban
users. Use of groundwater to grow qat1 has been a particularly significant feature in the
highlands. This agricultural revolution has brought some prosperity to rural areas in terms of
income. However, energy subsidies2 and restrictions on qat import from abroad have resulted in
high qat internal prices, which have deprived farmers of the opportunity for crop diversification
and export competitiveness country-wide, reducing the economic return from irrigation.
The International Development Association's (IDA's) longstanding involvement in the water
sector in Yemen put it at the forefront for the Sana'a Basin water management reform agenda.
The IDA was the principal partner of the Government of Yemen (GOY) in the water resources
management (WRM) and strategy since it worked with the GOY and other donors on the 1997
Water Sector Review and assisted in the development and discussion of the National Water
Strategy. The IDA-assisted Taiz Water Supply Pilot Project tested approaches to integrated water
resources management (IWRM), which provided valuable lessons for preparing the Sana'a Basin
Water Management Project (SBWMP).
1.2      Original Project Development Objectives (PDO): The PDO was to increase both the
quantity and the useful life of the available water resources within the Sana'a Basin by
increasing the efficiency of agricultural water use and accelerating aquifer recharge, so as to
allow time for a gradual shift to a less water-based rural economy, by the following:
   (i) Conserve water by introducing farmers to modern irrigation/improved equipment and
         methods that may save up to 40% of water (demand management).
   (ii) Change pumping and water use behavior in the basin through a comprehensive
         information and public awareness campaign (IPAC) that would touch all segments of the
         basin population (demand management).
   (iii) Accelerate recharge, in order to save precipitation run-off from evaporation (supply
         management).

     (iv) Obtain a better understanding of the basin's hydraulic situation through systematic
          monitoring, leading to improved water management (institutional development).
     (v) Build a strong and sustainable institutional base for central and local water basin
          management, including water regulation and enforcement, planning and water allocation,
          which may be replicated in other basins (institutional development).
1.3       Revised PDO: The PDO was not revised.
1.4      Main Beneficiaries: The primary target groups were farmers receiving subsidized
irrigation modernization support from the project and farmers using groundwater recharged by
rehabilitation of the dams and construction of spate breaks and check dams. People living
downstream of the rehabilitated dams would be also protected from dam failures. Those who
have houses and farmlands next to wadi3 would benefit from wadi bank protection works.
Farmers who use the saved water from the aquifers are also indirect beneficiaries. However, the
ultimate beneficiary of the water savings in the basin would be the population living in Sana'a
City. Without the project intervention, they would have to relocate to other cities due to scarcity
of drinking water in the future.
1.5       Original Components (as approved):
Component 1: Demand Management and Irrigation Improvement (US$11.7 million) aimed
to achieve water savings and conservation in agriculture by increasing the efficiency of water use
for irrigation through introduction of modern irrigation technologies. It would focus on all or part
of 10 selected sub-basins: out of 12,500 ha irrigated lands, the project initial target was 4,000 ha.
Component 2: Supply Management and Recharge Improvement (US$10.2 million) would
enhance and accelerate groundwater recharge through mostly small conventional dams, sub-
surface dams, and other structures. It was expected that farmers would pump from shallow
aquifers instead of the deep aquifers which are critical sources of drinking water for urban and
rural domestic use. The project would: (i) build five recharge structures, including 4 dams and a
series of low cascading check structures. Other potentially viable recharge technologies, such as
underground dams to catch sub-surface flows in wadis, spate breakers and water harvesting
structures, would also be studied; (ii) rehabilitate existing hill dams to prevent potential dam
failure as well as to recover recharge capacity diminished by accumulated sediments; and (iii)
establish dam management systems through strengthening capacity of the General Directorate of
Irrigation (GDI) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation's (MAI).
Component 3: Institutional Development and Capacity Building (US$3.2 million) included:
    (i) Regulatory Framework Development and Application: Given the flaws of the Water
Law, the project would support and assist National Water Resources Authority (NWRA) with the
drafting and finalizing of bylaws and regulations to mitigate some of the shortcomings of the
law. Subsequently, regulatory systems and procedures for water rights management, including
for registration and permit of well users and drillers, would be developed and applied.
    (ii) Basin Water Management: The NWRA-Sana'a Branch (NWRA-SB) would assume
responsibility for overall basin-wide water resources investigation, regulation and monitoring,
including delegation to user groups and monitoring of the regulatory system, overview and
execution of water resources research and monitoring programs in coordination with other

responsible agencies and stakeholder groups. It would also include supporting the evolution and
operation of the Sana'a Basin Committee (SBC) in an equitable and sustainable development and
use of the basin's water resources.
    (iii) Basin Hydrological and Water Resources Investigation and Monitoring: Systems
would be developed through community management to monitor and record climate, rainfall,
wadi flows and groundwater levels. Investigations and studies would include: (a) analysis of
project impacts through dam and other wadi structures on aquifer recharge and groundwater
levels; (b) exploratory deep boreholes; (c) physical surveys and laboratory testing for aquifer
modeling to gain a better understanding of the basin's hydro-geological characteristics and of the
groundwater balance; (d) satellite imagery/aerial photography at three points in time during
implementation to analyze and quantify impacts on cropped and irrigated areas; and (e) field
level water balance assessment at similar intervals to determine the effects of irrigation system
improvement on water use.
Component 4: Information and Public Awareness Campaign (US$1.2 million) would be
carried out by the NWRA-SB through a specially-staffed IPAC unit in close collaboration with
Technical Secretariat of the SBC (TS-SBC). It would consist of an intense program to convey
nuanced messages of water conservation to well-targeted population segments using a wide
range of media (TV, radio, newspapers, seminars and focus group discussions).
Component 5: Environmental Management Plan and Mitigation Program (US$0.7 million)
aimed at improving the overall environmental situation of the Sana'a Basin, notably through
water resources conservation, pollution prevention and improving environmental health
conditions. Evaluation carried out under the environmental impact assessment (EIA) concluded
that other than Dam Safety, Involuntary Resettlement, and Pest Management, none of the
safeguards were triggered. A model Pest Management Program for qat would be prepared within
six months of effectiveness.
Component 6: Project Management and Monitoring (US$1.5 million) would support costs
associated with project implementation and monitoring activities including capacity building,
procurement of office equipment and vehicles, office operation cost, project staff salary, etc.
Component 7: Phase II Project Preparation (US$1.5 million) would be done during the
second half of the project period on the basis of achievement of Phase I of the SBWMP and
subject to the findings of the project mid-term review and other assessments.
1.6     Revised Components: There was no formal revision of the components. However,
component level targets were attuned in agreement with the IDA during the mid-term review to
comply with beneficiaries' priorities. The project monitoring indicators were updated based on
these revised targets and recorded in the aide memoires. No supplemental letter was sent as a
result of the change in targets. As such, the targets used for assessment in this ICR are those
from the Project Appraisal Document (PAD)
1.7      Other significant changes (in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and
schedule, and funding allocations): At appraisal it was expected that the SBC, over time, would
be transformed into Sana'a Basin Agency to become the Coordinator of the basin IWRM
activities; and the project partner agencies that were responsible for each complementary activity
would be strengthened as the GOY's existing line institutional structure. This process did not
materialize as expected due to insufficient GOY commitment to the planned reform agenda. In
the early stage of the project implementation, the Ministry of Water and Environment (MWE)
                                                3
was created and the TS-SBC was designated as the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) without any
change in its function.
During the course of implementation in 2007, it was decided to consider farmer installation of
conveyance pipes and localized irrigation4 equipment using equipment supply contracts, with
outcome-based incentive structure for farmers. This new mechanism for transferring the
responsibility of installing conveyance and distribution systems to farmers worked well and
improved the pace of installation. The PCU carried out such contracts without being aware of the
need for revision of the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) in carrying out community
contracts. When this issue was noted, the Republic of Yemen (ROY) requested amendment to
the DCA and the amendment was signed on March 27, 2010.5
Plans for the SBWMP Phase II and the adaptable program lending (APL) approach were
changed in response to the decision to prepare a multi-donor Water Sector Support Project
(WSSP), which would fund water sector interventions including the continuation and expansion
of the activities piloted by the SBWMP. Allocation under Component 7 was used to help
prepare the WSSP.
At the request of the ROY, the IDA agreed in June 2009 to a 6-month extension of the credit
Closing Date from June 30, 2009 to December 31, 2009. This extension was needed to complete
works on the rehabilitation of the dams. Another 6-month extension of the credit Closing Date
from December 31, 2009 to June 30, 2010 was requested by the ROY and approved by the IDA
in December 2009 to complete the remaining small contracts. Moreover, reallocation of credit
proceeds and inclusion of "community participation" clause in the DCA was requested by the
ROY and approved by the IDA in March 2010.

2.        Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry: The overall project objectives were
consistent with both the current Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and the National Water
Sector Strategy and the Investment Plan in the country. The project was identified by the GOY
and supported by the IDA due to the seriousness of Yemen's water scarcity in which the CAS of
August 6, 2002, highlighted the sustainability of water resources as being one of the key
objectives for IDA assistance, with emphasis placed on improving water management for
environmental sustainability and economic growth.
Lessons learned from earlier IDA-financed projects such as the Land and Water Conservation
Project had been highlighted in the PAD, such as the avoidance of expansion of irrigated areas,
which has been mitigated by inclusion of beneficiary contracts to be enforced by the local
community, and the need to encourage farmers to take up project activities by providing a

    Localized irrigation is a system where water is distributed under low pressure through a piped network such as
    drip irrigation, sprinkler irrigation and bubbler irrigation.
5
    A total of 452 contracts valued at US$2.04 million (IDA financing amount US$1.739 million) had already been
    signed before March 27, 2010 under community contracting. In May 2010, the ROY requested that IDA approve
    financing of these 452 contracts. IDA carried out post procurement review and physical inspection of 91 contracts,
    equivalent to a sample size of about 20%, signed by the project before March 27, 2010. The review noted
    deviations from established shopping procedures; however, considering that this was community participation
    approach (community contracting), the IDA exercised more flexibility and concluded that the procurement
    procedures used by the Borrower were in accordance with the Community Contracting Guidelines. Consequently,
    the IDA approved the reimbursement of these 452 contracts following the merit-based review.
                                                           4
subsidy and using social mobilization to persuade farmers to take up modern irrigation
technologies. These were successfully taken up and implemented by the project. The PAD
correctly identified Yemen's weak Water Law and institutional arrangements (particularly the
NWRA-SB) as high risks for the project, but it overestimated the feasibility of the risk mitigation
measures proposed, i.e. rapid preparation and adoption of detailed by-laws to strengthen the
Water Law and effective capacity building for the NWRA-SB.
The project as designed had seven components involving intensive coordination and stakeholder
involvement including several agencies and line ministries. This required a wide base of
coordination which did not readily exist in the country. The project design underestimated the
difficulty the project would face in implementing its multiple physical activities (i.e.
improvements in irrigation, and rehabilitation/construction of dams) given the number,
organizational structure, and weakness in capacity of the GOY institutions involved in water
resources management. Moreover, the creation of the MWE in May 2003, three months before
the DCA was signed, also complicated coordination among implementing agencies.
It was a mistake in project design to establish the disbursement condition requiring improvement
of the quality of effluent and sludge from the Sana'a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) since
this was outside the scope of the project interventions and it turned out to be much more difficult
than expected. The condition was never met and the IDA finally had to waive it in order to allow
disbursements of civil works under component 2.
The project design underestimated the investments in time and human resources necessary for
effective community and social mobilization, particularly for overcoming local skepticism,
distrust, and lack of understanding of the project, before the project's physical operations in
irrigation improvement and dam construction could begin. This led to significant delays in the
early stage of project implementation.
2.2 Implementation (including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at
Risk status, and actions taken, as applicable): At mid-term review, three problems were evident:
(i) farmers were not interested in rehabilitating existing piped conveyance systems but rather
preferred to start new systems; (ii) there was slow progress on the delivery of irrigation systems;
and (iii) farmers lacked the motivation to join the community management water organizations.
The project made changes to accommodate the demand of beneficiaries: reducing the upgrading
of existing irrigation systems from 1,660 ha to 150 ha and increasing the conversion of open
channels to piped conveyance systems from 600 ha to 2,190 ha. In response to the slow delivery
of the irrigation systems and the request of the beneficiaries, the contracts of the five installation
companies were terminated and the WUAs were allowed to install the conveyance pipes by
themselves, supervise installation of the localized irrigation systems by a plumber, and enable
farmers to make in-kind contributions of labor.6 Requests for assistance were also channeled
through WUAs. The piped-conveyance system for transferring pumped groundwater irrigation
supplies to the field was well accepted by beneficiaries and there was considerable demand
which had been generated for the larger area in all the project 22 basins due to the considerable
savings in pumping time, cost of pumping and reduced irrigation water usage.


6
    The poor performance of contractors in installation of piped conveyance and localized irrigation systems made
    farmers dissatisfied with their works and high costs. This resulted in slow progress in installing of the modern
    irrigation systems during the first 3 years because the beneficiaries were reluctant to introduce them due to poor
    reputation.
                                                          5
The slow progress in implementing the irrigation component during the early stage of
implementation was also due to lack of farmer's interest in joining the water user groups
(WUGs) and WUAs.7 The formation of the WUGs/WUAs was a prerequisite to beneficiaries and
the farmers were not familiar with such associations. In the case of conveyance pipes there was
preference for ground polyethylene pipes. However, the PAD clearly indicated the conveyance
pipes should be buried polyvinyl chloride pipes to avoid farmers' moving them outside the
intended areas of irrigation and thus expanding cultivated areas. The social mobilization teams
(SMTs) had to play a very active role to explain the benefits of localized irrigation systems
through the WUGs and WUAs. This was finally accepted after intensive awareness-raising
campaigns and demonstrations.
The civil works for component 2 were considerably delayed because of several reasons. Firstly,
the Sana'a WWTP quality improvements of effluents were not complied with as required by the
environmental management plan (EMP) and set out in the DCA. Secondly, there were significant
delays in consultants' works8 and the submission of documents such as designs, drawings and
tender documents to the project management. Thirdly, there were delays in establishing WUAs
to perform the O&M of the 10 rehabilitated dams as well as the newly constructed Beryan
recharge dam. This required a more intensive effort of the SMT and the IPAC staff to persuade
the farmers of the benefits of forming WUAs. Fourthly, beneficiaries frequently intervened in the
contractor's work leading to delays on construction contracts including the stoppage of work.9
Contractors were also not given facilities to move rocks and other materials for construction
work and were made to go far to obtain the raw materials for construction. The consultants were
generally unable to be present on site due to a deteriorating security situation. Local authorities
and district authorities were not able to intervene on time to enable works to proceed10 and keep
implementation on schedule.
The four new dams envisaged at appraisal were not built because they were found not feasible.
The project constructed a series of check dams and one new dam (Beryan) at the site of an
existing dam which was destroyed by earlier floods. Also, three subsurface dams were not
constructed due to encroachment of urbanization to the planned construction sites.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization: M&E activities
were initiated in 2003 following the completion of a baseline study by consultants and through
ad hoc efforts by the various project teams in an uncoordinated manner. A more coherent system
was started in March 2005 with the support of an international consultant and later, with the
incorporation of a local M&E Specialist in the PCU in February 2006. M&E reports slowly
evolved into more complete and timely management tools as indicators monitoring movement
towards the achievement of PDOs were incorporated. At closing, 16 quarterly progress reports
were submitted since 2006, as well as several monthly reports. Around 50 outcome and results-

     The project supported the establishment of WUGs, usually farmers sharing a single well, and WUAs usually
     serving a single village, in addition to provision of technical assistance, training and extension.

     A consulting firm was engaged to provide overall coordination of component 2; however, they were found to be
     underperforming in their tasks and their contract was terminated. Unfortunately, no replacement was found to
     take over the overall coordination role for the activities under the component.
9
     Main requests were inclusion of works which were not in the contract in addition to frequent requests that
     contractors should employ local labor or hire machinery available from the beneficiaries.
10
     In some cases, this seems to have been due to incomplete inclusion of stakeholders in planning, and lack of
     understanding and agreement. However, in other cases, this seems to be due to opportunistic behavior with
     various persons trying to take advantage of the project to obtain additional benefits.
                                                        6
based indicators for the SBWMP covering all seven components were followed providing a good
sense of project performance. Project implementation was monitored using these monitoring
indicators which were updated quarterly by the PCU. This data was reviewed by the project
steering committee as well as IDA missions and used as the basis for supervision of project
implementation.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance (focusing on issues and their resolution): The
following summarizes the safeguard and fiduciary issues raised and the actions taken to ensure
safeguard and fiduciary compliance.
Pest Management (OP 4.09) ­ Although the project did not directly promote the use of pesticides
or other agricultural chemicals, the EIA recognized the public health concerns posed by the use
of these chemicals by farmers in the basin and recommended the implementation of integrated
pest management (IPM) plans in order to address them. The EMP indicated that the project
would support the mitigation activities of the Ministry of Public Health and Population
(MOPHP) through funding and institution building, particularly IPM for qat and grapes. The
project also supported public education promoting good sanitation and personal hygiene
practices in order to reduce exposure to water-based disease vectors. The project supported the
MOPHP's Bilharzias Control Project during 2006 in four project districts.
Safety of Dams (OP/BP 4.37) ­ The EMP recommended preparation of O&M plans and
emergency preparedness plans, and establishment of a dam safety review panel (DSRP) to
supervise design and construction. The project established and trained 12 WUAs to carry out
annual de-silting of reservoirs. The GDI undertakes regular inspection of all dam structures to
ensure their integrity and report any potential failures to the responsible authorities in addition to
monitoring any speedy repairs and rectifications of any faults. The DSRP reviewed dam designs
prepared by two international consulting firms and the GDI and monitored construction/
rehabilitation works. The DSRP provided technical reports based on its review of the dam
designs and 6 visits to the dam sites before, during, and after rehabilitation/construction. The
DSRP also reviewed the O&M and dam safety manuals, the emergency preparedness plans for
each dam and start-up operations, and concluded that project intervention has considerably
improved the stability and safety of the 11 dams; however, continuing technical supervision and
adequate funding for O&M is essential for dam safety.
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) ­ The project design originally included construction of
five new dams and a Resettlement Framework was prepared. Four of the new dams were not
built. One was built at the Wadi Bahman as a series of check dams and another new dam was
built in the site of a previously collapsed dam, so no land acquisition was required. As with other
IDA-funded projects in rural Yemen, the customary system of donating land for public interest
projects has been used for WUA offices, for which land title was formally transferred to the
GOY. This process has been based on thorough consultation and prior, informed, consent. In this
context it must be recalled that no formal legislation is applied in rural areas, and the IDA
approach is therefore based upon well-established community level systems where project
affected persons donate land and where no cash compensation is involved.11



11
     As emphasized by the June 2009 safeguard review mission to Yemen, the voluntary land donation - if the land is
     considered small - may be deemed appropriate in the Yemeni context. It should however be emphasized that this
     is dependent upon a well-documented land acquisition and negotiation process.
                                                         7
Procurement ­The project did not envisage participation of local communities in the
procurement of goods and works and the DCA did not provide procurement through community
contracting. During implementation, slow progress on the delivery of irrigation systems was
noted, and it was decided to involve community in procurement of irrigation systems. As
explained in section 1.7 and footnote 9, the IDA had to carry out a post procurement review of a
sample of these contracts followed by physical inspection of actual delivery in the field. This
problem would have been avoided, if the need for community participation in procurement had
been identified in the beginning and adequate time and resources had been planned for
community mobilization which is a rather very major effort. Although there was lack of formal
procedures in modifying the DCA for community contracts, project staff satisfactorily carried
out procurement in line with the IDA's guidelines, which was recorded in IDA mission Aide
memoires.
Financial Management ­ The project faced the problem of high staff turnover in the financial
management unit until the mid-term review. As a result of the midterm review, the project
management team was changed under the new project director. A new financial manger
improved submission of the financial management reports, prepared an acceptable disbursement
plan and budget for the project, and formulated an acceptable financial management manual
including accounting policies and procedures and necessary control to be applied. In the latter
half of the project implementation, financial management was carried out satisfactorily.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase: Over time the PCU has developed an effective way
to work with WUGs and WUAs in implementing project activities. The project has carried out a
thorough approach to consultation, supported by well-qualified SMTs. The post-project
sustainability of WUAs will be supported by the WSSP through establishment of a WUA unit in
the NIP. However, in order to make the WUGs and WUAs more sustainable after project
completion, a different approach is needed. Ways of addressing this include (i) avoiding
unrealistic expectations about perpetual GOY financial support, and (ii) a two-phase approach,
which is used under the Social Fund for Development Project, combining (a) intensive
participation in implementation with simpler organization for routine O&M and (b) much
stronger efforts to develop community water management, based on local institutions including
district councils.
By-laws to the Water Law would provide a legal framework for WUAs and basin committees,
but these have not yet been issued. The current draft by-laws propose many duties and
responsibilities for WUGs/WUAs, societies and unions, but do not provide proportionate
attention to ensuring that they have the legal authority to carry out their responsibilities. Review
of the draft bylaws indicates that they may still not clearly and specifically empower WUAs to
establish mandatory fees, create and enforce rules, and impose penalties including fines or
restricting access to water. If the goal is to have a legal framework that enables effective water
governance, then the by-laws should explicitly and specifically provide WUAs with the legal
authority to make and enforce rules that apply to all users sharing the resource, empowering
WUAs to carry out their responsibilities.
The project design did not address the issue of expanding non-agricultural activities, and little
has been done within the project to understand or assist diversification into other income
generating activities. Some attention has been paid to agricultural extension, but facilitating
changes to other crops and improved marketing was not a major area of activity. Therefore, the
project offers few lessons regarding adaptation to water scarcity through economic

                                                 8
diversification. Project experience and stakeholder views do indicate that there is large demand
and major potential benefits if more agricultural extension services could be provided. Economic
diversification and alternative income generation activities would be key issues to be addressed
for sustainable development of rural communities under the WSSP.

3.          Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation: The PDO was and is still highly
relevant. The National Water Sector Strategy and Investment Program of the GOY (updated
December 2008), aims at "sustainable and efficient use of the nation's scarce water resources",
which promotes IWRM as a means to attain this. The current CAS (April 2009) recommends that
forceful preventive action be taken to slow down the depletion of water resources. Although the
project design was in general sound and pertinent for attaining the PDO, risks and mitigating
measures related to the regulatory framework enforcement proved to be inadequate.
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives (details on outputs in Annex 4): The
project exceeded the two PDO indicators attaining more than 200% of the annual water savings
target by improved efficiency of agricultural water use and also attaining 120% of the annual
recharge target by recharge dam rehabilitation. The reduced groundwater use and increased
recharge of groundwater aquifers promoted by the project have definitely contributed to increase
quantity and the useful life of the available water resources within Sana'a Basin. This has
provided a good foundation for expanding support for these activities under the WSSP.
However, the project failed to put in place the planned institutional, legal and regulatory
framework to test and validate the model for its expansion to the rest of the basin, which needs to
be followed up under the WSSP.
3.3 Efficiency (Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return and Financial Rate of Return):
While at appraisal the ERR was estimated at 19.7%, at closing this indicator was estimated at
16.9%, considering a 20-year time frame.12 As water use and irrigation costs in the project area
has been reduced by almost one third (from 47 to 32 million m3 of water) irrigation costs also
were reduced accordingly. Together with crop yield increases, it resulted in productivity of water
being doubled from YR64/m3 to YR132/m3. The overall Net Present Value (NPV) was estimated
at closing at US$7.45 million (55% of the appraisal estimate), using 10% as discount rate (see
Table 1 below).

     All project components' costs were considered in the analysis, including those for which their specific benefits
     were not quantified (institutional development and capacity building; information and public awareness campaign;
     environment management and mitigation program; project management; and next phase project preparation
     studies). No shadow pricing for foreign exchange was performed since the official exchange rate broadly reflect
     the equilibrium rate. The only corrections introduced on market prices for the economic analysis were: (i) a 1.4
     conversion factor for irrigation costs was applied due to the subsidized cost of diesel fuel; and (ii) a 0.8 conversion
     factor for rural labor, given the high rates of underemployment in rural areas in the Sana'a Basin.
                                                              9
These result indicators do not consider the economic value of water savings from the installation
of modern localized irrigation systems (about 14 million m3/year), which if added at its
economic value (using the residual imputation method), the overall ERR of the project increases
to 29.6%. In addition to saving water, the project had a positive impact on farmers' incomes, as
crop yields and quality of produce improved with the improved conveyance and localized
irrigation systems, and labor and pumping costs decreased. Estimations at closing indicate that
farmer's incomes have increased on average by: (i) 13% in the case of improved conveyance;
and (ii) 39% when modern localized irrigation systems were adopted. Annex 3 provides a
detailed presentation of the methodology used for the analysis and the results obtained based on
the observations and interviews with beneficiaries in the field. Given these results, it can be said
that the project attained its economic and financial goals satisfactorily, validating the water use
efficiency measures that are expected to continue to be adopted by farmers in the basin.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating: Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Both PDO indicators' targets were exceeded at project completion and most of intermediate
outcomes targets were achieved. However, lack of results in developing a strong and sustainable
institutional basis for central and local water basin management means that there is limited
demonstrative progress in slowing down depletion of groundwater in the Sana'a Basin aquifers,
the APL Program Purpose and CAS Goal. As a result of weak control in well drilling and water
abstraction, aquifer depletion is still continuing at a rapid rate. While the project investments are
found to be economically and financially feasible, their sustainability is still questionable
because of the life of fossil aquifers is still highly endangered. Therefore, the WSSP should
continue SBWMP's effort to find successful ways to govern groundwater, shift agriculture to
balanced use of shallow aquifers, adapt livelihoods to a less-water based rural economy, and
ensure safe reliable domestic water supplies for urban and rural people.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts:
(i)       Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development: Poverty reduction was not
an explicit project objective for the SBWMP. The benefits from improving irrigation efficiency
and from recharge improvement have helped to mitigate some impacts of aquifer depletion and
to increase incomes. Although detailed information on poor farmers as proportion of
beneficiaries was not available, installation of modern irrigation through WUAs with community
contracting and in-kind labor contributions did make investment in irrigation efficiency more
affordable for poorer farmers.
The project developed women's WUGs and WUAs, which helped improve awareness of the
risks of water depletion, and understanding of ways to conserve water in agriculture and
domestic use. Although this approach was effective, given the high degree of gender segregation
in Yemeni society, the sustainability of these organizations is uncertain. The ICR mission
confirmed that there is substantial acceptance that women should have a major role in future
water management activities in the communities and the National Women's Union should
provide guidance and support to women's activities in water management.
While project staff initially met with skepticism and hostility about project benefits and
objectives, the project eventually developed good working relationships with farmers and local
leaders, within which debate, open discussion, and negotiation seem to function well. Patience,
diplomacy and consistency in project implementation have developed the social capital of trust
between stakeholders and project staff. This is further indicated by the high degree of satisfaction

                                                 10
with the project's approach and desire that this be continued. However, for community water
management, the emphasis was on having WUAs promote compliance with regulations
prohibiting unlicensed well drilling. There seems to have been relatively little recognition or
support for developing other local activities to protect domestic water supplies, regulate land and
water rights, resolve water-related disputes, and adapt collectively to increasing water scarcity.
Given the lack of success of top-down regulatory approaches pursued during the SBWMP, much
greater attention should be given to community-based governance, with specific support through
technical advice and enforcement under the WSSP.
(ii)       Institutional Change/Strengthening: Although the project attained most of physical
targets, it relied heavily on contractual staff and project modalities, and so did little to enhance
the capacity of the main water agencies including MWE, NWRA, NWRA-SB, and SBC. This is
attributable to lack of (a) qualified staff; (b) staff incentives; (c) proper management; (d) budget
allocation; (e) morale; and (f) leadership. Despite various training programs carried out under the
project, the impact of the training seems minimal.
Water user participation could be sustained and scaled up through increased attention to the
development of IWRM at the community and district/sub-basin levels. Great potential exists for
providing information and facilitation to help stakeholders assess their situation, consider
options, prepare action plans and carry out integrated community water management, with
support from the WSSP. A participatory water assessment process should focus on assuring
access to drinking water sources, avoiding harmful addition of wells and expansion of irrigation,
promoting efficient use of water, more intensive recharge and management of shallow aquifers,
and helping communities adapt to increasing water scarcity, including through livelihood
diversification. Participatory water management at the village and district levels would be part of
decentralized basin WRM, working under the guidance of the SBC.
(iii)    Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts: Improvements in irrigation efficiency are
making irrigated agriculture more profitable. Without limits on abstraction, they may accelerate
aquifer depletion. The net impact of the project may thus vary, depending on the extent to which
"savings" by project farmers are offset by more intensive irrigation, more irrigation by other
farmers, and continued overuse of wells that otherwise might not have been worthwhile to use or
deepen. Within the project areas, this has not been observed yet but may happen if there is not
proper control of groundwater by WUAs.
For rehabilitation of recharge dams, in some cases increased recharge upstream aquifers may
reduce water available to those further downstream, shifting its location. While Yemen has a
long history of managing rights to surface water, understanding of and institutions for regulating
rights to groundwater are less well developed. Consultation during design and implementation
was sought to address issues of upstream and downstream water rights where they have been
raised by stakeholders and tried to find equitable solutions within the respective WUAs.
3.6    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder: Annex 6 summarizes
some key points from the Sana'a Basin Water Conference, held during the ICR Mission, which
reviewed project achievements and discussed proposals for second phase activities under the
WSSP. The conference recommended that activities piloted by the SBWMP be continued under
the WSSP, emphasizing the need for concerned agencies to integrate their implementation.
Recommendations for adjustment include: (i) increasing the role of district councils and WUAs
in sub-basin governance; (ii) simplifying procedures for well licensing and handling violations;

                                                11
(iii) tightening regulatory control over drilling rigs; (iv) greatly strengthening NWRA-SB; and
(v) engaging in public-private partnerships for water supply.
4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome. Rating: Significant
One of the critical risks identified at appraisal was the possible expansion of irrigated agriculture
as a result of savings in water using the more efficient irrigation systems. The main mitigation
measure has been "contract agreement" signed by beneficiaries and to be enforced by
community management institutions. Few violations have reported to have taken place. Another
risk was the unlicensed drilling of wells in the Sana'a Basin. During the period of 2005-2009,
614 wells were illegally dug in the Sana'a Basin while only 106 wells had been licensed. This
clearly shows serious lack of governance in the Sana'a Basin and the project failed to succeed in
improving the regulatory framework and developing effective enforcement.
If the water saved by beneficiary farmers is being used by others, there will be little net benefit to
society and sustainable aquifer management. Achieving an impact requires scaling up the use of
modern irrigation technologies and limiting groundwater abstraction by controlling drilling of
new wells and halting expansion of irrigated areas. The only feasible way to this probably
requires a combination of vigorous development of bottom-up community WRM and more
effective regulation by NWRA, security officials and a functioning judicial system. Given the
difficulty of the problems and the limited political commitment shown to date, NWRA's task to
support IWRM seems impossible, unless and until there is a substantial change in political
support and drastic improvements in the capacity of NWRA headquarters and branches.
A further risk foreseen at appraisal was that the Sana'a WWTP's lack of improvement could
cause a health hazard and risk aquifer pollution. The PAD grossly underestimated the risk of
failure to improve the WWTP in a timely manner, rating it as medium risk, as well as the
mitigation measure proposed, i.e. the GOY's commitment to improve it. The result of the
monitoring quality of waste water from the Sana'a WWTP showed no improvement, meaning
that the risk has not been mitigated by the project.
The need to ensure an appropriate GOY role in O&M for dams, particularly large dams whose
failure could have serious consequences for life and property, was not adequately recognized.
The PAD says that there would be routine inspection of dams to review safety and performance,
but assumes that all O&M will be done by beneficiaries. Plans for O&M, particularly for
medium and large scale structures, should not assume that all O&M tasks could or should be
done by farmers, and instead should be based on a realistic assessment of the capacity of GOY
institutions, and on an appropriate combination of responsibilities. This should recognize the
technical capacities of the local government, the institutional capacities of communities, and the
financial constraints of farmers, WUAs, and GOY agencies; particularly the obstacles that both
agencies and WUAs typically face in mobilizing resources for preventive maintenance that
would be technically and economically advisable but is often at a high risk of being neglected.

5. Assessment of IDA and Borrower Performance
5.1 IDA
(a) IDA Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry. Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
While extensive and valuable work was done during preparation of the project, and the strategy
was sound, the institutional arrangements did not consider, and were greatly disrupted, by the

                                                 12
establishment of the MWE, something the IDA and other donors were aware of and supported.
The potential problems resulting from conflict between the MAI and MWE were not adequately
anticipated and adequate mitigating measures were not prepared. The Sana'a WWTP
conditionality was not pertinent since it was beyond the PCU's capacity to solve. The planned
new recharge dams under the supply management component were not adequately assessed at
appraisal.
(b) Quality of Supervision: Rating: Satisfactory
A total of 12 IDA supervision missions were carried out twice a year. In order to deal with
difficult policy issues including institutional reform, major effort of the supervision missions
were focused on the donor coordination and the preparation the WSSP from mid-2007 to mid-
2009. The issues identified in the mission aide memoires were clearly stated in the management
letters and followed up by the next missions until they were resolved. With close monitoring of
disbursement by the IDA, almost full disbursement was attained at the end of credit closure.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall IDA Performance: Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The IDA has promptly responded to queries from the PCU and other GOY agencies on
implementation issues and procurement and financial management aspects of the project, which
was appreciated by the GOY. The disappointing results from the third component, including the
deficiencies concerning the creation of the institutional, legal and regulatory framework, test
drilling and basin modeling may be primarily the responsibility of the Borrower or contractors,
but IDA missions could have been more active to help the PCU overcome the problems. In
consideration of these, overall IDA performance is rated as "Moderately Satisfactory".
5.2    Borrower Performance
(a)        Government Performance: Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
In spite of the continuous support of GOY authorities, on the ground the GOY was not able to
fulfill several commitments necessary for the full success of the project. Firstly, the disbursement
condition of the DCA stating that the GOY would carry out the improvement of the Sana'a
WWTP within a year, was not complied with, which made it necessary for the IDA after
continuous delays, to remove the condition in order to unlock and proceed with the project
investments. Secondly while the project provided assistance in preparation of the by-laws for the
Water Law since the early stage of the project, the by-laws have not yet been ratified by the
GOY, which significantly affected the performance of the project as there was a legal inability to
assure effective enforcement of the required regulations. Thirdly, the project could not strengthen
water agencies as planned because of insufficient commitment of the GOY to enforce their active
participation and to create the enabling settings. It is crucial for the GOY to beef-up its
commitment to improving water governance in Yemen in order to save limited fossil
groundwater to the next generations.
(b)        Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance: Rating: Satisfactory
The PCU (see 1.7) faced difficulties in relation with NWRA and the GDI in the early stage of
project implementation. This had been resolved by replacing PCU Director. Under the strong
leadership of the new PCU Director, the PCU staff was committed to the project implementation,
which is evident by the achievements of their strong teamwork. Their commitment to the work,
in spite of their initial inexperience with project implementation, contributed to the success of the

                                                 13
SBWMP. Although the PCU managed to attain most of their project targets, NWRA-SB was not
able to assume their responsibilities and role as expected.
(c)        Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance: Rating: Moderately
Satisfactory
Although the GOY's performance was "Moderately Unsatisfactory", the satisfactory performance
of the PCU especially at the second part of the project implementation allowed for recovering
most of the time lost, far exceeding expectations at the mid-term review.
6.     Lessons Learned
Strategic Approach ­ Implementation of effective groundwater governance, particularly control
over well drilling and groundwater use, as part of IWRM by NWRA and communities requires
strong commitment and support of the GOY and stakeholders, particularly water users. The
approach should be more focused on critical sub-basins and on more specific and achievable
objectives such as: (i) assuring access to drinking water, protecting the deep aquifer for the
highest priority needs; (ii) improving recharge and balanced usage of shallow aquifers; and (iii)
expanding non-irrigation livelihoods. Local communities need to assume the leading role,
supported by technical advice and well-targeted enforcement of the GOY.
Institutional Complexity ­ Projects should not underestimate the difficulty in implementing
activities in the water sector in Yemen given the number, organizational structure, and weakness
in capacity of GOY institutions involved in IWRM.
Community Mobilization ­ Projects should not underestimate the time and human resources
necessary to achieve effective community and social mobilization, especially in the development
of local understanding, support and capacity to cooperate in implementation, as reflected in the
functioning of local organizations, so that investments in IWRM can succeed. Well-qualified
SMTs are able to develop local understanding from scratch, grow good working relationships,
and develop strong capacity. Objectives and indicators should shift from an overemphasis on
formal WUAs to a recognition of the range of different kinds and scales of organization, and
performance indicators related to the specific ways in which local collective action helps to
achieve project objectives, e.g., through building understanding and support for the project
efforts; coordinating action by users in planning and implementation; and developing norms,
monitoring, and enforcement of local self-regulation for groundwater governance.
Pilot Demonstration ­ Demonstration of new irrigation technologies to improve irrigation
efficiency in pilot farms was very effective in expanding modern irrigation in rural Yemen.
Conditionality ­ Projects should avoid establishing legal conditions or requirements that are
clearly beyond the scope of the project to deliver (2.1 on page 5).
Community Contracts ­ Timely action would have been better in recognizing the need for
amending the DCA when it was decided (2007) to consider farmer installation of localized
irrigation equipment using equipment supply contracts, with outcome-based incentive structure
for farmers. This new mechanism for transferring the responsibility of installing conveyance and
distribution system to farmers worked very well with improvement in the pace of installation.
Qat     Increases in irrigation efficiency make qat more profitable and thereby worsen
groundwater depletion, unless expansion of irrigated area and groundwater extraction can be
limited effectively. Qat is problematic, as a major driver of aquifer depletion, for its impact on

                                               14
expenditures and family welfare, for health risks from pesticides, etc. Since the IDA is
supporting the GOY's Qat Reduction Program, it should not support activities that would
undermine or counteract this. If the goal is to reduce water use in qat while not subsidizing
irrigation equipment for qat farmers, then the existing farms could be supported by extension to
increase irrigation efficiency and training for installing modern irrigation equipment.
Management Involvement ­ It is crucial for the Management to be involved in resolving the
institutional issues of the Government in the early stage of the project implementation.
Involvement of GOY officials ­ GOY officials should be fully involved from project
identification to appraisal phases. Involvement of national consultants during these stages as
counterparts to the foreign consultants would lighten the burden of GOY officials but the chance
of on-the-job training of GOY officials would be lost, which would result in delay in project
start-up due to lack of capacity.

7.        Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a)  Borrower/implementing agencies: The issues raised by the implementing agencies are
commented as follows.
      ·   The preparation period of the SBWMP was too long (36 months) and risked changes in
          the political environment, which affected project scope and design. This is a valid
          comment and should be considered in the preparation of future projects in water sector.
      ·   The project was too complex, involving seven components and multiple GOY
          institutions. Although IWRM requires wide areas of interventions, a future project could
          focus on fewer key areas of intervention to improve IWRM.
      ·   The project's social mobilization and creation of community-based water management
          organizations delayed the physical operations compared to what had been planned, but
          ultimately led to better results, particularly once communities were more closely involved
          in implementation. The WSSP should avoid concentrating narrowly on physical progress
          and disbursement in a disintegrated way and ensure sufficient staff, budget, and time
          required for participation, institutional change and more sustainable results.
      ·   The legal covenant on the Sana'a WWTP delayed implementation of project activities.
          Any covenant which is beyond the scope of the project to deliver should not be included
          in the DCA.
(b)                Cofinanciers: None.
 (c)    Other partners and stakeholders: Project stakeholders include beneficiary farmers, line
ministries, regional and local authorities, contractors, consultants, and professionals from a wide
range of disciplines, both male and female. The PCU was always open to views and comments of
the stakeholders through workshops, training, field visits, IPAC activities, and SMTs' direct
contact with them, and took necessary action to resolve any issues raised, which was appreciated
by majority of the stakeholders.

     The total amount spent is larger than the original appraisal estimate because SDR has appreciated during project
     implementation. Out of the total credit amount of SDR17.6 million, only SDR1,650.07 was cancelled at project
     account closure.

                             ANNEX 2: Outputs by Component
Component 1: Demand Management and Irrigation Improvement
This component aimed to achieve water savings and conservation in irrigated agriculture by
introducing modern irrigation systems and equipment in the Sana'a Basin. It was envisaged at
appraisal that it would include upgrading of the existing piped systems (1,660 ha), conversion of
open earth channels to piped delivery systems (166 ha), introduction of localized irrigation
systems to farms already served by satisfactory piped delivery systems (1,960 ha), land leveling
for areas where no localized irrigation systems are included (315 ha), construction of wadi bank
protection works in some vulnerable reaches, use of plastic tunnels/covers for demonstration
areas (10 ha) with localized irrigation systems. The component would also support functional
community organizations such as WUGs and the establishment of WUAs at the village level,
assistance in institutional development for community management in O&M systems, provision
of capacity building for irrigation systems development and provision of extension and training
programs.
Several modifications had to be made to this component, which is a result of insufficient
assessment of requirements of potential beneficiaries at appraisal, including almost total
cancellation of the upgrading of the existing piped systems (1,660 ha reduced to 150 ha of which
only about 70 ha were implemented). This was replaced by increases in the conversion of earth
channels to piped systems, which was preferred by beneficiaries (600 ha increased to 1,440 ha,
and then to 3,048 ha by project closure). Localized irrigation systems met reluctance by
beneficiaries in the early stage of project implementation; however, the project's active and
effective awareness campaign convinced farmers of the benefits of these systems in water
conservation and improved yields, resulted in 1,685 ha implemented by project closure
representing 86% of the target envisaged at appraisal.
The wadi protection works were completed protecting about 315 ha of agricultural land, while
the land leveling was cancelled due to lack of interest by farmers. The construction of small
plastic tunnels was also cancelled and replaced by 58 green houses to demonstrate technology of
protected culture using drip irrigation system (2.2 ha) with five such green houses having been
given to the agricultural research center of Sana'a University.
This component was to develop community management of O&M of infrastructure implemented
under the project which resulted in the successful establishment of 48 functioning WUAs, 1,149
WUGs for a total membership of 11,546 farmers. Of the WUAs 38 were found to be active and
discharging their duties in a satisfactory manner as a result of which project management decided
that to support the sustainability of these associations, it would be necessary to construct and
provide basic furnishing for a small office cum a meeting room to house their activities. While
the construction of WUA offices was not envisaged at appraisal, it nevertheless does provide a
positive incentive for the WUAs to continue to function after project closure. This eliminates the
need for them to pay most of the dues from members to rent accommodation and having negative
cash flows which might result in discontinuing their activities soon after project closure.
WUAs contributed effectively to project implementation; however, their sustainability as
currently developed is questionable. During the ICR mission, the Minister of Water and
Environment, the Chairman of NWRA and others stressed the need to develop WUAs that can
rely primarily on their own resources, and which do not expect to depend on continuing financial
support from the GOY. WUAs, including those acting as aquifer management organizations,

                                               17
need legal authority to levy fees on water users, not just those who volunteer to join and
contribute. The Social Fund for Development Project uses a two-phase approach to community
organization, with intensive involvement of many people during implementation, and much
simpler organization for routine O&M afterwards. Such a two-phase model for organization
could help to create more realistic expectations about what WUAs might continue to do. If
WUAs, in whatever form, are providing specific useful services, such as protecting against
illegal well drilling and other harmful activities, resolving disputes related to water, and helping
farmers learn how to use water more efficiently and profitably, then this should provide a basis
for financial support from water users, district councils and other sources.

Component 2: Supply Management and Recharge Improvement
This component aimed to enhance groundwater recharge through new artificial recharge schemes
including 4 conventional dams, 3 sub-surface dams, a series of check dams, 20 spate breakers,
water harvesting pits, and 2,500m terrace rehabilitation in addition to rehabilitation of the 11
existing conventional recharge dams. These would enhance recharge of the quaternary alluvial
shallow aquifers so that farmers pump irrigation water from the shallow recharged aquifers to
save the deeper Tawilah sandstone aquifer for drinking of the population of Sana'a City. The
component also included institutional development, capacity building for community
management of O&M of dams and recharge systems in addition to support in implementation of
works through use of consulting services and works contracts.
Several modifications had to be made to this component, as a result of insufficient assessment of
the situation at appraisal. These included the decision not to construct four new recharge dams
based on the result of IDA review that the proposed new dams were not feasible investments at a
time when the consultants' designs were at an advanced stage. The sub-surface dams were also
cancelled because the planned dam sites had already been significantly influenced by
urbanization of Sana'a City; however, no attempt was made to replace these by other locations,
thus losing the opportunity of trying such an innovation in the Sana'a Basin.
The implementation of this component experienced serious delays due to the condition envisaged
in the Schedule 1, Clause 3 of the DCA which stipulated that no expenditures will be disbursed
under the Credit for civil works under Component 2 until the Borrower submitted evidence that
the quality of the effluent and sludge produced by the Sana'a WWTP met the specifications
agreed in the EMP. These requirements were not met by the other project causing considerable
delays in commencement of civil works for this component.

Component 3: Institutional Development and Capacity Building
The original cost estimate for Component 3 was US$3.2 million, and about US$3.6 million was
spent, 10% over the budget. It aimed at building a sound, efficient and sustainable institutional
and managerial base for IWRM, both during the project period and beyond it. In contrast to the
specific focus on the demand and supply management improvements of the first two components,
this third component was intended to overarch and integrate sector-wide, basin-wide and project-
wide aspects through: (i) adjustment of the water sector's legal, regulatory and monitoring
framework and processes for NWRA Headquarters; (ii) basin water resources planning and
management for NWRA-SB; (iii) capacity building for basin-based stakeholder water
management and institutional development relating to the sub-basins' Water User Federation and
the SBC; and (iv) development of specific hydro-geological and water resources monitoring and

                                                18
investigation studies and capabilities with and for the NWRA-SB and MAI. The main output was
expected to be an efficient and sustainable institutional and managerial groundwork pilot for
basin-based IWRM that would be expanded nationwide in the following phases.
Although considerable progress was attained, most of the core expected results are still pending,
and reasonable doubts remain about its overall completion, including the following issues: (i) the
Cabinet approval of the groundwater regulatory by-laws, and its operational validation through
enforcing the new policies with NWRA; (ii) testing and introduction of guidelines, systems and
procedures for water rights recognition, registration, licensing and administration with and for the
NWRA-SB; (iii) effective well and tanker registration with NWRA-SB; (iv) follow-up satellite
imagery studies for monitoring changes in irrigated areas, cropping patterns and evapo-
transpiration levels, which are crucial for project impact and water balance assessment analysis;
(v) creation of the WUFs at the sub-basin and overall Sana'a Basin levels for participatory multi-
source and multi-use IWRM; (vi) the drilling and testing of 3 exploratory wells to an approximate
depth of 1,000 meters to obtain information about aquifers, and new sources of drinking water;
and (vii) the development of institutional capacity in line agencies/ministries, and of synergies
among partner agencies working in the water sector, including those under the MWE, MAI,
NWRA, etc.
As a result of these shortcomings in the expected project achievements, while 106 wells were
licensed during the period of 2005-9, 614 illegal wells were reported,14 and groundwater
depletion continues to increase in the Sana'a Basin. After 7 years of SBWMP support, the GOY
is yet unable to enforce the new water legal framework, and control the random drilling which is
undermining the most important resource for the livelihood of the people in the country.
Under Component 3, the international consultant has prepared water balances for the Sana'a
Basin for 2007 and 2008, synthesizing earlier data and using new data collected during the
assignment: (i) hydrological monitoring in 4 sub-basins; (ii) water balance estimations in 6
reservoirs based on field data in 2007 and 2008; and (iii) field water balance at the farm level
(both furrow irrigation and localized irrigation techniques). The consultant summarized the
annual water balances and compared them with the water balances prepared by JICA15 (2006)
and by GWMATE16 (2003). The results show that the average annual depletion calculated by the
consultant is higher than earlier estimations. This is caused by the lower values for the irrigation
return flow used by the consultant. Although the annual water balances show differences, the
overall conclusion is consistent and confirms the high level of depletion that has been taking
place in the Sana'a Basin and consequently the urgent need to reduce the over-abstraction, which,
in the Sana'a Basin, means that the consumptive use of groundwater (for domestic and
agricultural use) exceeds the natural replenishment (recharge from rainfall and runoff). This
depletion started in the 1980s and has grown to about 280 million m3/year.
The assessment of water resources potential in the Sana'a Basin has synthesized information from
a wide range of sources and provided a framework and starting point for further work.
Unfortunately, it failed to provide clear information for a more accurate groundwater storage
estimate required for decision-makers. Therefore, the following things still need to be carried out

    Cases of unlicensed drilling by drilling contractors are increasing and only few cases were referred to the
   prosecutor with minimum fines decided by the Courts. Consequently, the process has not taken off and remains
   ineffective.

under the WSSP to improve the information that provides the basis for model calculations, refine
the model as a tool to support management, and to present results so that they can be easily
understood and used to help make decisions:
   (a)     Conduct additional deep drilling studies in the Tawilah Aquifer, including the portions
           outside the basin. Suitable analysis of cores, or (where cores are not feasible) of
           materials obtained during drilling, should be arranged in order to better understand the
           characteristics of the aquifer;
    (b) Carry out additional data collection and analysis to understand porosity and specific
           yield, particularly for the Tawilah Sandstone Aquifer, how this varies in relation to
           faults and other factors, and the implications for estimating available water;
    (c) Increase the number of wells and pumping test information used to estimate hydraulic
           conductivity parameters, including statistical assessment to exclude or suitably re-
           categorize values that are extreme or seem to belong to different distributions (for
           example hydraulic conductivity in gravels rather than sandy or silty alluvium).
           Additional data collection and analysis should be used to refine empirically based
           estimates of vertical conductivity as well as horizontal conductivity;
    (d) Refine estimates of calibrated values for hydraulic conductivity, and analyze the
           implications for the distribution of impacts from continuing deepening of wells, from
           action to save water and for aquifer recharge (i.e. the extent to which benefits are
           retained locally or rapidly lost to other areas). The implications of faults and other
           structural features should be included in this analysis, as well as empirical analysis
           from areas where significant levels of water saving or recharge activities have been
           carried out; and
    (e) Define priorities for the well monitoring program that would identify what kind of
           wells and what kind of data will be most useful for improving understanding and
           management of the aquifer. Among other things, this would emphasize wells with
           properly installed casing, and at relevant depths, to provide information that can be
           linked to specific aquifer units.
The groundwater model developed by the project consultant was used to simulate 4 scenarios for
future water management as follows: (i) representing the present status based on the year 2005
and is based on maintaining status-quo and not introducing any management measures. A
simulation of this situation at the year 2020 was made whereby the predicted water balance
components for 2020 were computed for the continued present rate of pumping, under the same
present rate of groundwater recharge; (ii) simulating the effect of water augmentation, i.e. the
increase of groundwater recharge considering the ongoing NWRA activities related to recharge
improvement and the GOY strategies to increase recharge; (iii) aiming at maximum sustainability
by reducing consumption of water resources and increasing the groundwater potential, based on
the WRM action plan for Sana'a Basin prepared by JICA in 2007; (iv) combining scenarios (ii)
and (iii), and simulating the effect of the 2007 WRM action plan and the ongoing GOY plan for
increasing recharge in some selected sub-basins.
Other scenarios may be needed to verify the impacts of specific management measures and
strategies that may be defined in the follow-up phase of the Sana'a Basin IWRM under the
WSSP. Estimates for sub-basins from the study do provide a framework for further data
collection and analysis to support management actions fitted to the conditions of different sub-
basins.

Component 4: Information and Public Awareness Campaign (IPAC)
The IPAC was well-designed, covering the full scope of stakeholders and outlined a program
using multiple media. Much of this was done in a highly participatory manner, through
workshops and training. In the project design framework, the objective of the IPAC activities
was to change pumping and water use behavior in the basin. The key performance indicator was
for IPAC to have generated observable changes in water conservation attitudes in all segments of
populations in the Sana'a Basin. Data was to be collected through a scientific survey on
behavioral changes compared to a baseline study.
IPAC team has carried out an energetic campaign using a wide range of media to reach targeted
audiences. Awareness of the dangers of aquifer depletion and need for water conservation has
improved significantly in urban and rural areas according to the results of pre- and post-project
surveys. The campaign has covered the population segments identified in the PAD, including
school administrators, teachers and students; imams and prayers in mosques; parliamentarians;
journalists; small and large farmers; WUA leaders, women and men; industrial users; agricultural
extension agents; and authors of educational books. This has been done through workshops,
seminars and training activities. Training was provided to 52 members of WUA committees, 180
women, and 25 agricultural extension agents. Awareness materials produced by IPAC team
include 5,000 copies of a cassette on the water situation in the Sana'a Basin; 15 quarterly
newsletters; brochures; leaflets; pamphlets; 12 booklets on several topics; 2,000 calendars; a
game; seven TV flashes; and three documentaries on the project, irrigation, and water saving.
Specific awareness campaigns focused on 44 public schools, many mosques, and the project
WUAs, as well as 37 women's WUAs that the IPAC team helped establish. Initial assessment
forms (pre-test) had been distributed before several awareness programs, to be followed by later
assessment and analysis to measure changes in community awareness. IPAC activities have been
well integrated with and have closely supported other project activities, particularly irrigation
modernization and WUA development. This has been a highly successful component of the
project. During the ICR mission, stakeholders urged that the IPAC be continued and expanded,
with even more attention to the specific needs of rural people.

Component 5: Environmental Management Plan and Mitigation Program
The EIA of the SBWMP identified a number of environmental and social issues to be raised by
the project (i.e. design, construction, and operational issues; dam safety; pesticide management,
environmental health; wastewater management; and resettlement/land acquisition) and
recommended appropriate mitigation measures and monitoring activities in the EMP in order to
address any potential adverse impacts. The EMP included measures to ensure adequate
consideration of environmental impacts in the design, construction and operation of the project's
physical interventions (particularly the dams). The design issues related mainly to the dams, their
access roads, quarries and borrow pits, ensuring that their designs and sites took environmental
impacts into account; avoided settlements, cultivated lands, cultural property, and valuable
ecosystems; and met international design practices. The construction issues, involving short-term
environmental risks and worker health and safety concerns, would be addressed in the
environmental, health, and safety clauses included in the construction contracts. The operational
issues, associated with the dams, would be addressed in agreements reached by farmer groups on
the minimum releases necessary to protect the water rights of downstream users and the routine
management of siltation problems in the reservoirs.

                                                21
The outputs provided by the project included the following:
   (a)   Dam safety, for which the project established a DSRP, composed of three dam experts,
         to review dam design reports and visit the dam sites before, during, and after
         construction in order to ensure the safety of the 10 existing dams rehabilitated, the one
         new dam, and a series of check dams constructed under the project. The DSRP carried
         out a total of six missions, producing reports and recommendations;
   (b)   Integrated pest management, for which the project worked with MAI/DPP to promote
         implementation of IPM plans for grapes and qat, to reach thousands of farmers in the
         Sana'a Basin with IPM and pesticide management practices, and to strengthen the
         technical capacity of DPP staff and enhance its laboratory capabilities for pesticide
         residue testing;
   (c)   Environmental health, for which the project worked with the MOPHP and supported its
         Bilharzia Control Project, which assessed the incidence of bilharzias in school children
         in four project districts, eradicated the disease vectors in infected water bodies in those
         districts, and provided treatment for infected school children in the two highly infected
         districts;
   (d)   Public awareness and education, for which (as discussed under Component 4) the
         project produced general information and public awareness campaigns on water
         conservation and management; designed and produced public awareness materials (e.g.
         booklets, brochures, television spots); organized workshops, field days and seminars for
         targeted audiences (e.g. farmers, schools, mosques); and delivered a special awareness
         campaign for farmers affected by the effluent from the Sana'a WWTP; and
   (e)   Institutional development and capacity building in GOY institutions, for which the
         project provided training for staff of:
           · the NWRA-SB, the GDI, and the MWE in topics ranging from IWRM, localized
               irrigation and water management, water rights and policies, water quality control,
               and water savings in irrigation management, to the design of awareness plans, the
               use of remote sensing and GIS, and the preparation of socio-economic studies;
           · the Environmental Protection Authority in environmental impact assessment,
               monitoring and enforcement;
           · the SBC in water rights and policies and integrated water resources management;
           · the DPP in IPM practices and for laboratory staff in DPP in pesticide residue
               testing and analysis; and
           · the Bilharzia Control Project of the MOPHP in bilharzias control and eradication
               programs.
The project's main issue related to Component 5 was improvements at the Sana'a WWTP. As
discussed earlier, under the project, the GOY committed to improve the quality of the effluent
and sludge from the Sana'a WWTP. In the end, this required decisions on major investments to
improve the capacity and operation of the Sana'a WWTP by GOY institutions over which the
project had no control. The project had to resort to short-term measures to protect public health,
including awareness campaign and early warning system for the farm communities in the wadi
below the WWTP, and to provision of laboratory equipment in order to improve laboratory
analysis at the WWTP. The ICR mission learned that the much-needed physical and operational
improvements at the WWTP are now underway and should be completed in the next two years.
                                                22
It remains to be seen, however, if the desired improvements in the quality of the effluent and
sludge will be realized. Any additional improvements that may be needed, as well as the
construction of a second WWTP for Sana'a, could be addressed in an investment operation under
the urban water supply and sanitation component of the WSSP. In any case, the urgent nature of
the risks identified by the SBWMP remains - in terms of public health risks for the farm
communities in the wadi below the WWTP and the risks of further contamination of the
groundwater in the basin.

Component 6: Project Management and Monitoring
While the DCA provides that the SBC shall be responsible for project coordination, this role was
shared by a newly formed PCU which was also responsible for monitoring as well as financial
transactions of project activities. The PCU also took the supervision responsibility of demand
management activities while the Dam Unit of GDI took the supervision responsibility of supply
management activities and NWRA-SB for supervision of the institutional development and
capacity building activities. IPAC and environment management were supervised by both PCU
and NWRA-SB. The SBC, chaired by the Minister of the MWE, had overall authority over
project activities and met regularly, being responsible for coordination and enforcement legal
agreements.
After difficulties in the early years, project management by the PCU was quite effective.
Monitoring of project implementation developed over time to track a broad range of progress
indicators. Procurement and financial management enabled effective implementation in
compliance with the IDA guidelines and procedures.

Component 7: Phase II Project Preparation
This component was to prepare the second phase of the SBWMP during the second half of the
implementation period, based on the findings of the mid-term review and other water sector
assessments. However, the subsequent agreements developed between the GOY and the IDA in
the CAS of 2005 substituted the original idea by a water sector wide approach (SWAp) in order
to integrate several IDA-financed operations under implementation within the water sector.
Preparation of this SWAp operation was partially financed by this SBWMP component and
successfully completed resulting in a US$350 million operation (WSSP). Project funds have also
been used to develop a "Phase II" proposal outlining activities and budgets to continue and
expand SBWMP activities under the WSSP.

                         ANNEX 3: Economic and Financial Analysis
Benefits and Costs
The SBWMP's expected main benefits were to: (i) increase the useful life of groundwater
resources in the basin through net water savings (NWS) from the first four components; and (ii)
decrease the likelihood of human and socio-economic losses due to dam failure (from the second
component). Additional benefits, though not specifically included in the PDO, are increases in
farmers' income through improved financial returns of irrigated agriculture (from first two
components).
Increasing the useful life of groundwater resources in the Sana 'a Basin was the primary
objective of the APL, of which the project was a first phase. The project aimed at: (i) improving
the knowledge of the water balance and usable groundwater storage; and (ii) testing a
combination of technical, financial, regulatory and institutional instruments aimed at increasing
water availability (supply management) and decreasing water use (demand management). How
much the project extended the useful life of groundwater resources, if any, is not known because
still the groundwater imbalance and the exploitable groundwater storage are fraught with high
degree of uncertainties; and the effect of the project on the aquifer system is still unknown as the
horizontal expansion of irrigated agriculture was not monitored. The second objective was not
achieved since the regulatory framework is still to be approved by the Cabinet, enforcement by
the water authorities has not been strengthened, and mechanisms for community-level self-
regulation and peer enforcement, as discussed in the PAD, have also not yet been well
developed.
The PAD estimated project benefits by the aggregation, at the level of the basin, of estimated
NWS and valuing them with the economic value according to their future use. NWS had been
realized mainly from a decrease in the non-beneficial use of water (i.e., evaporation). It was
attained by increasing the irrigation efficiency through the dissemination and validation of
improved irrigation techniques, and through enhancing groundwater recharge from surface run-
off by the construction and the rehabilitation of dams and other structures, while preventing
irrigation expansion.
NWS have been quantified for the first two components, namely the irrigation improvement
component (40% of project costs) and the groundwater recharge component (30% o f project
costs). NWS were expected to reach about 8 million m3/year at full development or about 5% of
the current annual consumptive use and 6% of the current annual groundwater mining in the
Sana'a Basin. Assuming a constant mining of the aquifer over time (129 million m3/year), the
project would extend the useful life of the aquifer by 5%.
The public awareness campaign (5% of project costs) and the legal and institutional development
components (15% of project costs) were both critical to achieve these NWS by helping contain
irrigation expansion and by encouraging the adoption of improved technology and management
systems, including the proper O&M of infrastructure. The additional NWS from the public
awareness campaign and the legal and institutional framework were not quantified even though
they could be substantial, as their scope was not limited to the areas covered by project's physical
investments, but included the entire Sana'a Basin concerning all water uses (not only irrigation).
As more awareness of water scarcity in the basin is achieved and a proper regulatory system is in
place, subsequent increased willingness and improved capacity of local communities and the
GOY to counter the depletion of the aquifers would be facilitated.

                                                24
Based on the field studies conducted during project preparation, it was estimated what could
result from the project interventions. It was expected that about 4,000 ha could benefit from
project first component (30% of the four areas of concentration, 17% of the entire basin); of
which: (i) 600 ha would be converted from open earth canals into piped-conveyance systems; (ii)
1,700 ha of the existing piped conveyance would be rehabilitated; and (iii) 1,700 ha would
require the installation of modern localized irrigation technologies. The project ended improving
4,877 ha (22% more than expected) with a different combination of interventions: (i) 3,117 ha
converted from earth canal into piped-conveyance systems; (ii) 71 ha with rehabilitated piped
conveyance; and (ii) 1,687 ha with installed modern localized irrigation systems.
The net annual water savings from irrigation improvement was expected to reach 7 million m3 at
full development and the achievement was doubled to about 14 million m3. Net water savings
from groundwater recharge were estimated at about 1 million m3/year, of which 30% would
come from the construction of 4 new dams and 70% from the rehabilitation and removal of
accumulated silt in 11 existing dams. At closing, it is estimated by an independent expert study17
that recharge was increased by 1.2 million m3 (120% of the target), though many of the foreseen
structures were not done for different reasons (mainly the 4 new dams, and the 3 sub-surface
dams). This increased recharge is expected to be sustainable only if the infrastructure is properly
maintained and silt is removed annually as part of the O&M works of the dams so that
groundwater recharge potential is maintained. The prevention of potential socio-economic
damage by a dam failure downstream of the rehabilitated dams has also been an important
benefit of the project.
The economic value of water savings was estimated in the PAD considering that the irrigation
sector accounted for 96% of consumptive use in the basin while the municipal and industrial
sectors 4%. The economic value of water in agriculture was estimated at appraisal at US$0.26/m3
using the residual imputation method (the value-added of water was calculated on the basis of
crop and farm budgets and average cropping pattern in the project area). For this ICR evaluation,
the same method was used for valuing water, but specifically referred to the project area. The
cropping pattern was based on the aggregate beneficiaries' real cropped areas: qat being the main
crop covering about 32% of the covered irrigated area, followed by vegetables (30%), grapes
(18%), fruit trees (11%) and other crops (9%). Crop budgets have been prepared for the main
crops based on representative farms in the project area. Agricultural technologies and input and
output prices, were assumed to remain constant at 2010 values. Pumping cost although
increasing over time, as the depth of the water table increases by an average of 4 to 10 meters/
year, were assumed also to remain constant in order not to overestimate results. Based on these
assumptions, the average economic value-added by consumptive water used in irrigation was
estimated at US$0.29 per m3 for the ICR assessment. This economic value for water was used to
quantify the benefits of the increased recharge of water to the shallow aquifers (Component 2).
Agricultural benefits From visits to the project area, it was possible to estimate that in addition to
saving water, irrigation improvement had a significant positive impact on farmer revenues as
crop yields and produce quality improved, and labor and pumping costs decreased. Yield
increases are in the range from 10 to 30% in the case of the introduction of modern irrigation
systems, and the reduction in the volume of water pumped and in costs of irrigation from 30 to

As can be seen from the expected productivity gains and values detailed in Table 1, the
estimations conservatively considered yield increases to be between 10 ­ 20% in the case of
localized irrigation systems with production costs reductions of 7 ­ 29%. Resulting net incomes
per cultivated ha would increase between 8 ­ 133% as a result of the combined effects of
increased production and reduction in the irrigation costs (reduced labor and energy costs, etc.).
In the case of maize, which is mainly a self-consumption crop, the starting net income was very
low, and as such, shows increases of 23 to 43 fold. It can also be observed that net income from
qat is more than double than those obtained with grapes and almost 10 times greater than the net
income generated from vegetables or other fruits like peaches.
All project components' costs were considered in the analysis, including those for which their
specific benefits were not quantified (institutional development and capacity building,
information and public awareness, environment management and mitigation program, project
management, and next phase project preparation studies).

Economic Rate of Return (ERR) Analysis
The ERR and NPV were calculated for the overall project based only on those benefits mainly
derived from the irrigation improvement and groundwater recharge enhancement components.
For the first component crop budgets were aggregated considering the areas occupied by each
crop in the benefitted farmer land, following the pace of farmer/area incorporation to the
modernization process as actually occurred under the project implementation period. No shadow
pricing for foreign exchange was performed, since the official exchange rate broadly reflect the
equilibrium exchange rate. The only corrections introduced on market prices for the economic
analysis were: (i) a 1.4 conversion factor for irrigation costs was applied due to the subsidized


                                                 26
cost of diesel fuel; and (ii) a 0.8 conversion factor for rural labor, given the high rates of
underemployment in rural areas in the Sana Basin.
As can be seen in Table 2, the overall project ERR was estimated at 16.9%, including all project
components' costs, and the NPV at YR1,639 million (US$7.45 million). In the table, it is also
shown that aggregated water used by benefited farmers has decreased from about 42 to 37
million m3, and water productivity has increased from YR64/m3 to YR132/m3.
When the irrigation improvement component was considered alone, the ERR resulted in 42%
and for the enhanced recharge component alone, a negative ERR was obtained. The latter is
explained by the fact that two of its major benefits were not quantified, namely, the decreased
risk in the potential damage of socio-economic infrastructure downstream, as well as the
beneficiary participation in water resource management. The rehabilitation/construction of 11
dams, together with the strengthening of nonstructural dam safety measures such as monitoring
of the dams safety, O&M of the dams and the development of emergency preparedness plans
definitely contributes to the benefits of the project, but are difficult to value as: (i) no quantitative
estimate is available on potential property damage; and (ii) no attempt was made to quantify the
economic cost of human mortality and injuries. The dams rehabilitated were posing serious
threats to downstream populations (estimated at about 5,450 people at appraisal) and their
properties and would continue to be the case if they would have not been rehabilitated.

Financial Analysis
Farm models were built to assess the project financial impact over typical farmers benefiting
from the two major activities implemented under the irrigation improvement component
(conversion of earth canals into a piped-conveyance system, and introduction of a modern
localized irrigation system). Quantified benefits from irrigation improvements were assumed to
be: (i) savings in pumping costs (both capital and O&M) as a result of improved conveyance and
irrigation efficiency; and (ii) agricultural yield increases, based on observations made during the
ICR mission field visits. Yield increases are resulting from a more adequate water supply to
crops through the installation of localized (drip, bubbler, or sprinkler) irrigation systems and
were conservatively assumed to be between 10 to 20%.
The following Tables 3 and 4 show the financial budgets for the farm models representing
typical farmers of 0.5 ha, showing the average cropping patterns in the project area (qat, grapes,
vegetables and maize). As shown in the tables, family benefits have increased in both cases
representing the improved conveyance and the introduction of the modern irrigation systems by
13% and 39%, respectively. In the first case, benefits are due to reduction in irrigation costs, and
in the second, due to the increases in yields and the reduction in irrigation costs.
Cost Recovery: Considerable levels of project subsidies to participating users have been applied
under the SBWMP to: (i) accelerate participation in this first project, thereby having a strong
demonstration effect; and (ii) serve as incentive to farmers to refrain from future use of the saved
water and future expansion of irrigated areas. The levels of beneficiaries' contributions to capital
costs were 25% in materials and 90% in installation costs for the modern localized irrigation
systems; and 60% in materials and 100% in installation costs for the improved conveyance
system. All O&M costs are borne by the direct beneficiaries. Both farm models include the
corresponding investment and grants received by the project, and the resulting increments in net
family benefits,
For the construction and rehabilitation of recharge dams, contribution from beneficiaries to the
capital costs of dams was not foreseen. O&M costs that relate to dam structure performance and
safety are the responsibility of the GDI. However, local beneficiary communities would
undertake or arrange for: (i) dry season sediment removal from reservoirs for maintaining
recharge benefits; and (ii) upkeep of dam and reservoir access roads.

     ANNEX 5: Community Water Management: The Need for a Bottom-up Approach18

The SBWMP has achieved many things: improving public awareness of the dangers of aquifer
depletion, using SMTs to involve stakeholders, engaging water users in installing efficient
irrigation technologies and in carrying out civil works, reducing water use in irrigation while
increasing yields and profits for farmers, and building and rehabilitating structures to recharge
groundwater. Nevertheless, it also is important to note what has not been achieved and consider
ways in which future action, particularly under the WSSP, might need to be changed in order to
have more prospect of success.
The PAD stated that, under the current conditions in Yemen, the only feasible approach to
controlling groundwater extraction would be through local self-regulation. It discussed a
participatory approach involving water users. It supported working at multiple levels, from local
to basin and to national. However, some of these aspects have not been fully applied in the
SBWMP, as discussed in other parts of this ICR, the Action Oriented Policy Paper (AOPP),19
and the Yemen WUA study. If some of the approaches used in the SBWMP are not changed,
then there may be little prospect of success in improving water management and livelihoods.

1. Top-down licensing has failed. A primary strategy has been to require licensing of all wells,
and prohibit drilling of unlicensed wells. A protection zone was enacted for the Sana'a Basin.
However, unlicensed well drilling continues to be widespread. There has been little effective
enforcement even when violations have been reported.
The strategy seems to be based on a presumption that it will be feasible to obtain compliance
with licensing requirements, and that this would solve problems. Hypothetically, this might work
if there were a strongly established rule of law, highly skilled bureaucracy, and relatively weak
incentives to continue groundwater exploitation. However, the feasibility under current
conditions in Yemen seems very questionable. The complexity of aquifers, limited information,
and cost of investigations makes technical assessment of groundwater difficult, particularly in
Yemen. Even with stronger regulatory framework, limited capacity of NWRA and other
institutions could make it difficult to process applications in a timely way, avoid corruption and
manipulation of the approval process, and prosecute violators through the formal legal system.
Furthermore, many existing wells have already been drilled deep, resulting in a large installed
capacity to extract groundwater.
Thus, the prospects for imposing licensing through a top-down process and relying on
prohibition of unlicensed drilling to control groundwater over-extraction seem highly
problematic. However, prevalent norms about well spacing, concern about protecting drinking
water supplies, and increasing awareness of the dangers of aquifer depletion seem to create
fertile conditions for promoting a community-based process to develop local regulation. One
way to reinforce local efforts would be through the kind of simple, locally-based procedures for
well-licensing, based on public, participatory review at the community and district levels, that
have been piloted in Amran, and were discussed in the AOPP and in the Sana'a Basin Water
Conference held on May 30-31, 2010, along with recognizing and supporting local consensus-

18
   There was no specific beneficiary survey for this ICR, and it was not required since this was not an intensive
   learning ICR. Hence, it was replaced by this Annex on Participatory Water Management.

   The AOPP was prepared by a group of consultants at the end of the project to evaluate achievements and the
   challenges at the threshold of the second phase under the WSSP.

                                                       34
building and action to strengthen community norms and self-governance related to groundwater,
including drinking water access, well spacing to avoid harmful interference with the existing
wells, efficient, non-wasteful irrigation practices, and balancing of public and private interests in
groundwater use.

2. Well drilling is not "random." Frequently discussion is framed in terms of the problem being
"random" or "haphazard" drilling of wells. This terminology can lead to confusion and
misunderstanding about problems and solutions. Firstly, drilling is not random, because it is done
by landowners based on their rights to land. Secondly, deep wells are expensive; so all those
investing are very concerned to choose the location as well as possible. Thirdly, there seems to
be an assumption that if drilling were done in an orderly, licensed way, there would be no
problem. Given the economic incentives to use groundwater and the political context, even an
orderly, fully licensed system might be unable to restrain rapid aquifer depletion. However, it is
clear that there are local norms, particularly well spacing, which often help regulate well
installation, and in many places there is growing support for tighter restriction. Since well
drilling is not a "random" phenomenon and comprehensive control is not a realistic objective,
interventions should be targeted at: (i) supporting local efforts to regulate wells and improve
water governance; (ii) deterring investment by irrigators in the deepest, most expensive, and
riskiest wells,20 which pose the greatest threat to the availability of water for future potable use;
and (iii) selecting those areas which offer the best prospects for shifting to more sustainable use
and recharge of shallow aquifers.

3. Large basins are only one level of governance. Development of a SBC has been an
important institutional objective. While many meetings have been held, stakeholders are not yet
well represented. The SBC lacks authority over well drilling, water abstraction or finances.
Furthermore, a basin-wide commission is distant from the level at which most important water
use decisions are made. Large basins may be useful for coordinating some relatively macro-scale
issues, and be a significant level within multi-level, multi-scale governance, but most problems
are more likely to be managed effectively if addressed at a more local scale. The complexity and
slow movement of groundwater mean that problems are most immediately felt by individual
owners and communities, as are the impacts of remedies such as conservation and recharge. The
potential for transferring water from agriculture to urban use also depends on specific local
transactions, as it might be more systematically developed, (and as already occurs with tanker
markets). To the extent that top-down actions by the SBC and GOY agencies are seen as vehicles
for taking water away for urban use without compensation and denying it to agriculture, there is
likely to be strong local opposition. Overemphasis on the basin level, without adequate attention
to district and community level activity seems to have led to slow progress or even stagnation. At
the same time, there seems to be much local demand and potential for community-based
strategies to take meaningful steps to improve water management at more local levels.
4. Water users associate in many ways. Water users have played an important role in project
implementation. WUGs and WUAs have processed requests for subsidized irrigation equipment,
organized installation of piped conveyance systems and localized irrigation systems, and
accepted responsibilities for O&M of recharge structures. Many groups have attempted to help
prevent unauthorized well drilling; monitoring and reporting violations. Some have helped to
20
     Part of this would be to focus on controlling the more expensive and sophisticated drilling rigs needed for deeper
     drilling, as discussed in the AOPP and the Sana'a basin water conference.

                                                           35
monitor groundwater levels. However, the formal WUAs established by the project have
depended on funding from project implementation, and mostly lack alternative sources of
reliable local funding. They are not yet providing services that would assure steady funding from
members, district councils or other local sources. There has been inadequate recognition that
formal WUAs are only one of many forms of collective action for water management, which also
includes traditional institutions for managing spate flows and springs, shared investment in wells,
informal groups managing irrigation and water supply systems, and private sector water
providers, in addition to formal bodies registered under the NGO Law, Cooperative Law or other
laws. WUAs in their current form are not empowered; they lack explicit authority to enforce
rules and fees necessary to govern the resource and are not yet well linked with district councils
which could provide authoritative backing. Overemphasis is on a single form of organization,
imposing an institutional monoculture, risks disrupting existing institutions that are playing
important roles in providing services. A more effective strategy would be to weave together
networks of diverse kinds of association, formal and informal, linking village, district, sub-basin
and basin levels in a process of network governance.
5. Commons can be managed. A simplistic misapplication of ideas about "the tragedy of the
commons" may lead to a presumption that individuals are doomed to overexploit resources or
analysis as if the only remedies were privatization or centralized authority. Research has amply
documented the capacity of communities to govern commons, given time and supportive
conditions. The GOY may be able to provide a positive role, but it may be even more important
that the GOY avoid disrupting or delegitimizing local institutions, and instead recognize and
accept their potential. Water users are in a situation of repeated interaction, in which cooperation,
based on communication, agreement, monitoring, and sanctions is often a superior strategy, even
in tragedy of the commons21 or prisoner's dilemmas.22 Furthermore, the underlying situation may
instead be that of a Stag Hunt (assurance game,) or a game of Harmony, where those who do not
cooperate are worse off than those who cooperate, and where most people are ready to cooperate
as long as they are sufficiently confident that others will also cooperate. More specifically, the
relatively slow movement of groundwater means that individual users and communities retain
many of the benefits of conservation, efficiency, and recharge, offering them incentives to work
together. They are already embedded in networks of local institutions. Local conditions vary,
there are no guarantees, and there are serious challenges to be overcome, but there are good
reasons to expect that communities can work together to find solutions for governing shared
water resources, especially if encouraged by suitable technical and regulatory support.

6. Water governance should not neglect the strengths of Yemeni culture. Water policy,
programs, and projects have been primarily framed in the discourse of modern IWRM, relying
on formal laws, national bureaucracies, and formal organizations, such as basin committees and
WUAs. While theories of IWRM may emphasize stakeholder participation and integration with
local ideas, this has not been adequately put into practice. There seems to have been inadequate
recognition of the social capital that exists in the local institutions that already regulate land and
water, resolve disputes, and organize collective action. Traditional spate irrigation systems have
been built and rebuilt for centuries, relying on local resources and traditional leadership roles and

rules. Although some of the problems posed by deep wells and motorized pumps are new,
traditional Islamic principles of assuring access to drinking water, avoiding harm, avoiding
waste, and balancing private and community benefit are highly applicable. If water management
is perceived as requiring that people be educated to understand IWRM theories, and people are
assumed to only act out of economic motives of efficiency and narrow, short-term, short-sighted
self-interest, then the prospects may be dim. However, if the strengths of existing local
governance institutions are better recognized, and local problem-solving facilitated, using
multiple forms and levels of organization, aided with technical advice, appropriate funding, and
enforcement for which there is local support, then the prospects appear much better.

Supporting community water governance. The issues discussed above concern some aspects
of how project implementation has been understood and pursued. Both PADs for the SBWMP
and WSSP show a deeper understanding which is consistent with participatory community-based
approaches. As recognized in the SBWMP PAD, the only route to more effective and sustainable
water governance is likely to lie through the development of local self-regulation, at the scale of
villages and districts, which can be supported by technical advice and by enforcement of
regulations consistent with rules that have been agreed to by communities of stakeholders. This
requires much more attention to a bottom-up process to recognize the ways in which
communities already regulate land and water resources and resolve disputes, improved
information and participatory assessment of problems and potential solutions, and development
of local consensus on ways to improve water management and ensure effective enforcement.
Key elements of a strategy would include:
   (a) Convening. Bringing people together and facilitating local assessment and problem
       solving in communities and district;
   (b) Informing. Providing customized technical advice and training to help local people
       better understand their aquifers and catchments, and how management be improved;
   (c) Empowering. Ensuring that local water governance has authority to make and enforce
       rules that apply to all water users, through suitable processes at multiple scales, within
       communities of irrigators sharing streams and aquifers, and within districts;
   (d) Enforcing. Responding to local requests to prohibit drilling of wells that could harm
       other users and to prevent other unwise use of water resources; and
   (e) Funding. Investments in aquifer recharge and in diversification of livelihoods beyond
       irrigated agriculture may yield widespread and longer-term benefits, but are risky, may
       not always pay off quickly, and may be beyond local capacity to finance; offering a role
       where outside investment can make a difference.
In simple terms, this can be summarized to say a bottom-up approach is needed that encourages,
facilitates, informs, and helps enforce locally-driven water management. A much stronger
emphasis on participatory water management could build on the successes of the SBWMP, in
involving communities in implementation, increasing water efficiency, and improving awareness
of the dangers of aquifer depletion. It could be designed to concentrate on developing local
regulation, suitably backed by outside technical advice and enforcement, work on helping
communities adapt to sustainable use of shallow aquifers and more diversified livelihoods,
weave together multiple kinds of organizations at multiple levels into network governance

governance, dispute resolution, and moral reasoning.

                    ANNEX 6: Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results
The Sana'a Basin Water Conference held on May 30-31, 2010 brought together a range of
project stakeholders to review progress and discuss future directions. Participants came from the
MWE, MAI, parliament, district councils, water user associations, and universities.
Topics. Presentations on the first day covered the basin water assessment study, institutional
development and capacity building for local communities and for planning and implementing
agencies, raising public awareness, demand management and improvement of irrigation, supply
management and aquifer recharge, environmental management, and an example of WUA
experience. On the second day members of the team preparing an AOPP to assess results and
make suggestions for a next phase of activities made presentations on water governance; water
resources management; regulation; irrigation improvement; and meeting demand for water
supply, followed by group and general discussions. Some main points from presentations and
discussions are summarized below, and are discussed in more detail in the conference documents
and the AOPP.
Governance. Governance accomplishments include establishing the SBC, involving local
councils in water management, and setting up WUAs. While the SBC has been active, meeting
46 times, WUAs and civil society are not yet included and local councilors did not always attend.
There is not yet an agreed basin plan and the SBC lacks authority to allocate finances and
enforce decisions. It was recommended that local councils be empowered and given training and
technical support to act as the intermediate level in local water resources management, for
dispute resolution, discussion, and regulating illegal well drilling in partnership with the security
forces. WUA capacity and prospects vary considerably, some helping prevent illegal drilling and
others being more passive, set up largely to get project benefits. Women, who make up half of
WUAs, should be more involved. Farmers should work together to manage water sustainably,
acting to help stop unlicensed drilling, install modern equipment and use irrigation water more
efficiently. WUAs and district councils should be supported by partnership with the NWRA-SB
for: (i) information and joint development of sustainable management plans for sub-basins; (ii)
empowerment for monitoring and self-regulation; (iii) capacity building; and (iv) investment
funding.
Water Resources Management. A comprehensive water resources assessment study has been
completed, with a monitoring network set up and some data being collected and analyzed. A
revised groundwater model was used to assess water balances separately for 22 sub-basins.
While there is debate about some aspects of the study, it does provide a framework and starting
point for further monitoring and analysis. A basin master plan needs to be adopted, and
translated into a five-year plan and annual programs for financing and implementation. This
should focus on sharpened objectives of ensuring affordable safe water for domestic and
industrial use, sustainable farm incomes, and win-win transfers between uses, supported by a
small but effective planning function in NWRA-SB.
A process for licensing wells has been developed, but only 106 wells were licensed from 2005 to
2009, while at least 614 illegal wells were recorded. Drilling firms are registered by NWRA
headquarters, but control is not effective. Water by-laws have been prepared but not approved.
Conclusions from the last five years are: (i) regulation will only work if farmers and WUAs
cooperate as front line water managers; (ii) local councils work with them to control drilling rigs
and illegal drilling; (iii) they should be supported by the SBC and by the highest level of the

                                                 39
GOY; and (iv) drillers should cooperate as professional businesses. Simple bottom up processes
could be tried for license applications and controlling illegal drilling. WUAs could comment on
license applications, with the local council ensuring due process, and the SBC making final
decisions. WUAs would report illegal drilling to the local councils, which would halt drilling,
and NWRA-SB and the local security departments would investigate. Violators' wells would be
concreted and offending drillers and rigs blacklisted. At the same time, NWRA regulation should
work to professionalize drillers, concentrating on the few rigs capable of drilling into the deeper
sandstone aquifer.
Irrigation and Recharge. Piped conveyance systems have raised irrigation efficiency up to 60%,
and localized delivery by bubblers, sprinklers and drip up to 80-90%, enabling farmers to pump
40% less water while increasing income by 10%, yielding water savings equal to 17 million
m3/year from 4,135 ha. If all 18,953 ha were modernized irrigation water use might drop from
221 million m3 to 133 million m3 and some sub-basins might return to living within the annual
recharge. Project experience indicates that cascades of check dams and spate breakers provided a
cost effective way to increase aquifer recharge. IPM for grapes and qat helped limit overuse of
pesticides. Irrigation improvement needs to be economically justified and linked to sustainable
water management, integrating water resources planning and management, support to WUAs,
agricultural extension, and irrigation improvement, even if done through different agencies.
Questions concern whether irrigation improvement should only be subsidized if the WUA signs
up to a sustainable management plan for their area, and how qat, which covers more than half the
irrigated area, should be handled.
Water Supply. Sana'a is the third fastest growing city in the world. The local corporation
supplies only half the city's water needs, and the network is expanding only slowly. In total,
public and private supply equal 50-60 million m3, equivalent to annual recharge for the basin.
The Local Corporation has 6 wells go dry each year, and drills ten new ones, at rising costs.
Farm wells supply urban fringe areas and the tanker trade. In the long term, water supply in the
Sana'a Basin has to come from the good quality water in the deep sandstone aquifer, which must
be protected. Public/private partnerships should be developed, encouraging private suppliers to
form an association, with light (self) regulation; public support for private network supply, and
licensing WUAs to become water suppliers.
Institutional Capacity. Phase II implementation will require greatly enhanced institutional
capacity, above all in the NWRA-SB, including planning and programming; water resources
assessment; capacity building and empowerment support to the Basin Committee, local councils,
and WUAs; public awareness; and regulation. This will require careful definition and
regularization of functions; a management audit; increased operating budget; recruitment of
experienced, highly qualified staff; improved work environment; clearly defined partnerships
with stakeholders; and raising staff commitment and effectiveness through performance-based
incentives, training, and conversion from contractual to staff status.
Discussion. There was substantial discussion, after presentations and in the discussion groups.
Much of this added depth to the topics discussed, and asked for clarification on various points.
Participants said that more of the presentations and materials should have been available in
Arabic. Several participants said they had hoped for a format that took a more balanced approach
to examining both achievements and problems of the project. In general, participants
recommended that the activities piloted by the SBWMP should be continued under the WSSP,


                                                40
and emphasized that shifting to implementation through permanent national agencies poses
challenges, and that agencies must integrate implementation for the program to be successful.
Approaches recommended during the conference included:
   (a)   Expanding the role of district councils and WUAs (including both irrigation and water
         supply) in sub-basin water governance;
   (b)   Simplifying procedures for licensing wells and handling violations, involving WUAs,
         district councils, and the SBC;
   (c)   Tightening regulatory control over drilling rigs and professionalizing drillers,
         concentrating on the rigs capable of drilling into the deeper sandstone aquifer;
   (d)   Greatly strengthening the institutional capacity of the NWRA-SB; and
   (e)   Increasing public-private partnerships for improving water supply.

Some points on which there was significant debate included:
   (a)   Whether to subsidize irrigation modernization for qat;
   (b)   How much to expect from WUAs in controlling illegal drilling and how much should
         be done by security forces and NWRA;
   (c)   The role of dams in future water resources development; and
   (d)   Whether the SBC should be given authority over financial allocation and licensing
         wells.

         ANNEX 7: Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR
The SBWMP was initially designed to be a 15-year APL (2004 ­ 2019). The APL is designed to
be in three phases, each of about five years. The current project represented Phase I of this
program (2004 - 2009). The main purpose of the program is essentially to assist the GOY in
slowing down the depletion of groundwater in the Sana'a Basin aquifer to gain time for the GOY
to convert the Sana'a Basin economy to less water intensive activities. There is no perennial
surface runoff in the country and the Sana'a Basin entirely depends on groundwater for
agriculture and human consumption. Intensive abstraction and low recharge of groundwater led
groundwater to deplete at alarming rate which if not checked through appropriate measures,
would have negative social, economic and environmental impacts on the farming communities in
the rural areas of the basin and urban people, especially in Sana'a City.
Project Approach: The main features of the project approach focused on achieving: (i)
slowdown of groundwater depletion by demand and supply management: (ii) change in pumping
behavior with intensive information and awareness campaign among the farming community in
the basin as well as the formation of WUGs/WUAs and providing capacity building for them to
effectively participate in groundwater management; and (iii) acceleration of the shallow aquifer
recharge and persuasion of farmers to use water in the shallow aquifer instead of the high quality
water in the deep sandstone aquifer.
Project Objectives: The main development objective of the SBWMP is to increase both the
quantity and the useable life of the groundwater resources available in the Sana'a Basin, and so
postpone the date at which extremely expensive new supplies may have to be brought in from
outside the basin. To accomplish this objective the SBWMP would: (i) implement, test and
develop "best practice" demand (primarily irrigation) and supply (primarily recharge)
management methods in a limited area, for later application of lessons learnt in large-scale
implementation throughout the Sana'a Basin, under the subsequent two phases of the program,
(ii) rehabilitate and rebuild selected dams to improve downstream safety; and (iii) establish the
regulatory, legal and institutional framework needed for more sustainable WRM in the basin.
Status of Achievement of the SBWMP Development Objective: The overall objective of the
SBWMP was consistent with the CAS of the IDA and the national water strategy and the
irrigation policy in the GOY. The overall objective was achieved through the implementation of
the project activities under the six components, each of which required intensive level of
coordination and stakeholder involvement.
Disbursement Profile: The financial information reveals that the actual annual as well the
cumulative disbursement lagged behind up to 2008. The disbursement picked up significantly
from 2009. This is attributable to the significant progress in the construction/rehabilitation of
civil works under Component 2 as well as the procurement of pipes and equipment for
improvement of water conveyance and localized irrigation systems under Component 1 to meet
the large demand generated by SMTs and IPAC.
Project Benefits: Most of the activities implemented under Components 1 and 2 generated
quantifiable as well as non-quantifiable benefits while the benefits generated as a result of the
implementation of the activities under Components 3 and 4 were not quantifiable. In economic
analysis, only quantifiable benefits of Components 1 and 2 were used as the entire project
benefits.


                                               42
Non-quantifiable Benefits: The non-quantifiable benefits generated by the project include social
benefits, institutional & capacity building benefits and environmental benefits as follows.
       (a) Social benefits: The acceptance of the farming communities in the Sana'a Basin to
           contribute in cash to the investment to acquire water-saving modern irrigation systems
           gave them a sense of ownership of the systems, which has made them real partners in
           groundwater conservation in the basin. As a result, the beneficiary farmers have become
           more responsive to the mitigation measures that address the water scarcity problem in
           the Sana'a Basin. The project has also provided for technical and organizational support
           to local farmers well-based groups (WUGs) and to the established community
           groundwater user organizations (WUAs) at village level.
       (b) Institutional benefits: The project established 52 WUAs (48 functioning) within the
           targeted areas of the basin. In addition, it provided the WUAs with infrastructural
           support and capacity building through organizing workshops/seminars, field days, and
           foreign study tours. The project contributed to improving the national implementation
           capabilities of the PCU staff through the recruitment and posting of international experts
           and international consulting firms who provided on-the-job training. The project also
           provided capacity building to a number of the staff of the implementing partners
           (NWRA-SB, NWRA, Dam Unit of MAI, DPP of MAI, and EPA) in terms of local and
           foreign training.
       (c) Environmental Benefits: The project implemented environmental activities including
           IPM plans for qat and gapes, control of bilharzias in three districts, support for the
           Sana'a WWTP and red flag warning system for the users of effluent and sludge water
           produced by the WWTP.
Quantifiable benefits:
Component 1: The activities implemented under the three subcomponents of Component 1
generated quantifiable benefits in the form of irrigation water savings as a result of installation of
the modern irrigation systems in farmers' fields, which also contributed to increasing farmer
income through increase in crop yields and reduction of pumping costs (i.e. through saving of
fuel, labor and energy). The saving of water by 21% was realized as a result of the upgrading of
the existing piped system and the conversion of open canal system to piped conveyance system.
Average water saving of 36% was also realized as a result of the introduction of localized
irrigation systems.
Component 2: The purpose of the supply management is to enhance groundwater recharge
through rehabilitation/de-silting of the existing dams and construction of new dams. It was
expected that farmers would pump groundwater from shallow aquifers rather than from the deep
aquifers which are a critical source for drinking and domestic water needs for Sana'a City. In
case of the existing dams, groundwater recharge potential was estimated by measuring the
additional runoff that would have occurred before removing the silt. The revised project target
included the reconstruction of one new dam and rehabilitation of the 10 existing dams,
construction of 10 pits and 47 check dams.23 The estimated recharge now stands at about 1.2
million m3. These savings will materialize only if the infrastructure is properly maintained. It is


23
     A small dam less than 3 m built across a narrow wadi to increase recharge to shallow aquifers.

                                                           43
indeed critical that the silt is removed annually as part of the O&M works of the dam so that
groundwater recharge potential is sustained.
Economic Evaluation of the Project Quantifiable Benefits: The quantifiable benefits used in the
economic analysis include the value of net water saved and the increase in crop productivity per
hectare as a result of the installation of the modern irrigation systems as well as the value of net
water savings from groundwater recharge as a result of reconstruction of one new dam and
rehabilitation of the 10 existing dams through de-silting and increasing the storage capacity. For
the purpose of economic analysis, the net quantity of irrigation water saved under the demand
management component and the supply management component will be valued at its opportunity
cost (i.e. average weighted return to water YR/ m 3 ) for irrigation and for human consumption.
Economic Valuation of Net Water Saved: The irrigation water savings under the piped
conveyance system and the localized irrigation systems used in the economic analysis are based
on the field confirmation survey conducted by the SBWMP in 2008. The economic price/return
to water is calculated as an average of weighted return to water used for irrigation of the main
crops in the basin and the average price of water for human consumption in Sana'a City.
Economic Value of Incremental Production: The incremental value of crop production is
calculated using the crop budgets and the with/without project approach and multiplying the
incremental production value per hectare under improved conveyance systems and localized
irrigation systems by the total area covered by each system, respectively. The increase in
productivity for the different crops under the improved conveyance system and localized
irrigation system is derived from the project reports.
Results of Economic Analysis: Based on the above, the economic analysis is carried out on the
Component 1and on the project as a whole and the results are presented in the table below.

  Economic parameter                    ERR as appraisal      ERR on Project Completion
  Demand management component                 47%                       51%
  Project as a whole                          19.7%                     17%

Problems Encountered during the Implementation of the Activities of Component 1: Two
project risks were quite evident at the midterm review. The first was slow progress on the
delivery of the irrigation systems and the second was that farmers lacked the motivation to join
the community water management organizations (i.e. WUGs/WUAs). Moreover, the other
problems also aggravated the progress of adoption/installation of the localized irrigation
systems including: (i) poor performance of the contractors for installation of the localized
irrigation systems (as against the planned coverage of 400 ha by each of the five contractors, a
total of only 460 ha were installed in more than two years); (ii) farmers' perception that their
10% contribution to the cost of installation in cash was very high; and (iii) significant delays in
establishment of the WUAs in the basin.
Actions Taken to Address the Problems:
   (a) In view of the unacceptable performance of the contractors and reluctance of the farmers
       to deal with the contractor, the PCU terminated the contracts of the contractors in



                                                44
            August 2008 after taking the approval of the project steering committee (PSC)24 and the
            IDA.
       (b) The PCU designed a revised installation mechanism acceptable to the farming
           communities, which was approved by the PSC and the IDA in 2008. The main features
           of the revised installation mechanism are as follows.
           ·   The technical unit of the PCU will continue to carry out the survey and design of
               farmers' fields in which improved conveyance and/or localized irrigation systems to
               be installed;
           ·   The project signs a contract of partnership with the WUAs to supervise the
               installation of the improved conveyance and/or localized irrigation systems; and
           ·   The supervision and/or installation will be through the WUAs, thus recognizing the
               role of the WUAs in the farming community.
       (c) The project management and its SMT and IPAC staff exerted enormous efforts to
           enlighten the farmers and raise their awareness on the importance of organizing
           themselves into WUGs/WUAs to get benefits from the project services. As a result of
           the continuous efforts of the SMTs and IPAC team, farmers gradually become more
           responsive and appreciative of the role of the WUGs/WUAs and started to join these
           community organizations.
Achievements under each Subcomponent of Component 1
The demand management and irrigation improvement component was designed with an
objective to save water use in the agricultural sector. The satisfactory implementation of the
activities under Component 1 and achieving the targets of each of its subcomponent determine to
a large extent the project success in achieving its overall development objectives. The project
targets and physical achievements under each of the subcomponents of Component 1 are
presented in the table below.

Water savings realized: Annual water savings were calculated using savings in irrigation water
consumption under each of the three water saving irrigation systems. The average water savings
are derived from the previous studies conducted in the project area and the confirmation study
carried in 2009 in the Sana'a Basin. The quantity of water saved up to June 2010 under
upgrading of the conveyance system subcomponent, the conversion to piped system
subcomponent and the localized irrigation system subcomponent amounted to 0.187 million m3,
8.022 million m3 and 6.667 million m3, respectively.

Achievements under Other Farm-level Irrigation Protection and Improvement Measures:
Land leveling: The PCU requested the IDA to drop the land leveling activity since it was not
considered as technically feasible under the project conditions. This was accepted by the IDA
and recorded in the Aide-Memoire of February 2006.
Wadi Protection Work: Wadi protection work was based on the demand from WUAs who decide
the location for the project intervention. The wadi protection work was implemented at project
cost with no contribution from the beneficiaries. The target of protecting 315 ha was achieved.
Plastic Covers/Tunnels: This activity was cancelled because of lack of interest from the
beneficiaries to take up this activity. This activity was replaced by procurement of greenhouses.
A total of 58 greenhouses were procured by the project, of which 53 were purchased by farmers
and installed under the direct supervision of the PCU.
Institutional Development for Community Management and O&M Systems: The SMTs
worked very hard in forming WUGs/WUAs in the basin and successfully established 1,149
WUGs and 52 WUAs under Component 1 with a total membership of 11,546 farmers. Although
the project provided capacity building training to WUA administrative committees and provided
office buildings, sustainability of the WUAs has not been assured. The empowerment of the
WUAs with clear cut clauses in the water law and ability of the WUAs to enforce these clauses
is essential.
Achievements under the Supply Management & Recharge Improvement under Component 2:
Brief Background: The objective of this component is primarily to enhance groundwater
recharge through the rehabilitation of the existing conventional dams, and construction of new
conventional dams, as well as through the construction of sub-surface dams, check dams and
other structures. It is expected that farmers would then pump from shallow aquifers rather than
from the deep aquifers which are a critical source of drinking and domestic water supply for
Sana'a city. A further objective is to effect safety improvements of the existing dams.
Problems Encountered before the Commencement of Implementation of the Activities under
this Component: it is envisaged in the Schedule 1, Clause 3 of the DCA, that " No withdrawal
should be made for expenditure under Category 1(a) and 2(a) ­ Civil works- unless and until the
Borrower shall have submitted to the association evidence satisfactory to the association that the
quality of the effluent and sludge produced by the Sana'a WWTP has met the specification
agreed upon between the Borrower and the association and as set forth in the EMP. The above
requirement was not immediately met by the management of the Sana'a WWTP and thus causing
enormous delays in the commencement of the civil works under the supply management and
recharge improvement component. The civil works started only after the IDA relaxed the above
requirement. The requirement of forming Water Users Organization in the basin to perform the
O&M of the rehabilitated dams posed a problem at the beginning. However with the intensive
efforts of the SMT and the IPAC staff, twelve WUAs under component 2, were formed to
perform the O&M of the rehabilitated dams but after considerable delays.
Problems Encountered during the Course of Implementation of Project Activities: The
implementation of the civil works under the supply management and recharge improvement also
suffered implementation delays. These delays were attributed to the very frequent interventions
by the beneficiaries in the contractor's work and stoppage of their work for various reasons such
as, to include work not originally included in the design and BOQ of the contract, employ labor

                                               46
from their village/locality and other beneficiaries require the contractor to hire their machinery,
etc.
Actions Taken to Address the Problem: The project management approached the local
authorities including security to intervene. The local authorities in many instances resolved the
dispute, but another dispute arose the next week with the same contractor. The PCU also tried to
involve the local leaders to resolve these problems but with limited success.
Achievements under each Subcomponent of Component 2
Rehabilitation of Existing Recharge Dams: A total of 10 existing recharge dams were
rehabilitated while Beryan Dam, which was originally planned to be rehabilitated, was
reconstructed as a new recharge dam for security reason. A total of 10 ground pits were build for
water harvesting. A total of 47 cascade check dams were built to increase recharge of flood in
wadis. All these structures were handed over to the Dam Unit (DU) of the MAI.
Construction of New Recharge Dams and three Subsurface Dams: The construction of four
new dams and three subsurface dams was cancelled by the PSC on the basis of the
recommendation of the WB evaluation report in February 2007 and May 2008 respectively.
Institutional Development for Community Management, O&M of Dam and Recharge
Systems: The SMTs have successfully supervised the formation of 68 WUGs which were
consolidated in 12 WUAs. The responsibility of these WUGs/WUAs is to carry out the O&M
and recharge system for the rehabilitated dams and the new constructed dam (Beryan dam). The
scope of activities under the Component 2 is reduced and accordingly, it could be concluded that
the overall objectives of Component 2, may be moderately achieved.
Achievements under each Subcomponent of Component 3
The Water Law and its By-laws: Amendments to the Water Law were approved by the
Parliament in December 2006. The by-laws have been drafted and approved by the MWE in
2008. The bylaws were passed from the cabinet to the Ministry of Justice and are currently being
reviewed in the Legal Department of the Ministry of Justice.
Well Registration and Licensing: With the project's assistance, NWRA-SB initiated the well
registration process. Cases of violation of unlicensed drilling are increasing and only few cases
of violations were referred to the prosecutor with minimum fines decided by the courts. Due to
the lack of support from the highest level of the GOY, the well registration and licensing process
was not fully implemented.
Capacity Building for Water Resource Planning and Management (NWRA-SB): The project
supported NWRA-SB with office equipments, technical equipment for surface and groundwater
monitoring, transportation, and the required budget for monitoring activities. The project
provided capacity building through local and foreign training to technical staff in NWRA-SB and
representatives of WUAs.
 Local Technical Training: A total of 66 specialists from NWRA-SB (27 Nos.), PCU (23 Nos.),
MAI (10 Nos.) and MWE (6 Nos.) benefited from local technical training organized by the
project.
Local Farmers' Training: To raise the awareness and knowledge of the administrative
committees of the WUAs on their future role in water resource management, the project


                                                47
organized workshops and seminars for 181 members from the WUAs and officials from the local
districts.
Regional Training: The PCU coordinated foreign training for the technical and management
staff from the line ministries and representatives from the WUAs. A total of 58 representatives
from the WUAs joined foreign study tours in addition to 25 staff members from PCU, 26 from
NWRA-SB, 28 from GDI/MAI, 12 from EPA, 4 from SBC and 11 from MWE.
Hydro-Geological and Water Resources Monitoring and Investigation: The objective of this
subcomponent was to setup and execute comprehensive hydrological and water resource
monitoring and investigation program to achieve a better understanding and quantification of
Sana'a Basin surface and groundwater resource availability. As a result of this study, it was
expected to have a realistic estimation of the impact of water saving and aquifer recharge
investments in the basin. An international consulting firm was contracted to carry out the
following studies: (i) aquifer storage investigation and assessment; (ii) water balance estimation
and sub-basin monitoring; (iii) groundwater modeling; and (iv) hydrological monitoring and
analysis. The final study reports were submitted to NWRA-SB during 2009 ­ 2010. Another
international consulting firm specialized in satellite imagery data analysis was contracted to carry
out the satellite imagery study in 2006. The outcomes of the satellite imagery study were
incorporated as an important input in the water balance and groundwater modeling studies. Since
the final report was approved in 2008, it become evident that the remaining time for project
closure in June 2009 would not allow the completion of a second study, which was not carried
out. The overall assessment of outcome under this component is considered as moderately
satisfactory.
Achievements under the IPAC Subcomponent:~The IPAC team organized on continuous basis
several workshops, field days and seminars as part of the awareness activities. The workshops
and seminars reached out farmers and public schools and teachers at different targeted areas in
the basin. The IPAC team also prepared and distributed several types of awareness material,
which were distributed during their campaigns to the public at different events, including Al-
Salsabil quarterly news letter, brochures, leaflets and pamphlets, the SBWMP annual calendar
for 2007 and 2010, production of three films including, SBWMP documentary film, modern
irrigation training film and domestic water saving film, etc.
Schools Awareness: The IPAC carried out school awareness campaigns aiming at explaining the
current water situation in Sana'a Basin to students and teachers. The campaigns reached out 44
public schools in the basin. The students in many schools organized social/entertainment events
(i.e. poetry, songs, plays, etc.) to the villagers on groundwater scarcity, mitigation measures,
water saving technologies and the role of farming communities in groundwater conservations for
sustainable livelihood in the basin.
Mosques Awareness: The PCU coordinated with most of the mosques' Imams in the basin and
provided them with awareness publications and organized meeting with them to explain the
critical water situation in Sana'a Basin to enable them to prepare typical speeches for Friday
prayers. Each Imam in the Friday' speech explains the scarcity of groundwater in the basin and
the mitigation measures to conserve water. These has been influential messages and highly
accepted by the prayers.
Women Association Awareness: A total of 37 women associations in Sana'a Basin were
established with support of IPAC team. The female specialist in the IPAC team has held a

                                                48
number of meetings with each of the women WUAs. The female specialist distributed a variety
of awareness material to the members of women associations during these meetings to raise their
awareness and knowledge about the critical groundwater situation in the basin. In view of the
above, it could fairly be concluded that the achievement of the objectives of this component is
highly satisfactory.
Achievements under each Subcomponent of Component 4
Dam Safety, Siltation and Downstream Effects: The DSRP carried out six missions to the
project and performed physical inspection of the rehabilitated dams The DSRP evaluated the
status of each of the rehabilitated dams as satisfactory.
Public Health: The first phase of combating bilharzias was training of staff involved in the
implementation of this activity. The second phase was field survey for the prevalence of
bilharzias infections and vectors within the targeted districts. Public awareness program for
mitigating the effect and avoidance of causes of bilharzias was jointly prepared by the MOPHP
and EPA.
Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement: No land acquisition was required for the
infrastructure. Only small parcels of land required for WUA office buildings were contributed by
beneficiary farmers.
Wastewater Treatment, Wastewater Reuse and Sludge Reuse: The environmental monitoring
system continued gathering data of effluent and sludge of the Sana'a WWTP with no
improvement whatsoever in terms of quality. The PCU provided the Sana'a WWTP with
laboratory equipment for water quality analysis. A special red flag system was developed to send
warning messages through mobile phones to around 200 farmers who are directly or indirectly
using the wastewater from the WWTP. The red flag warning is sent out when the sewerage is
released through the by-pass from the WTTP without treatment.
Pest Control and Pesticides Management: IPM Plans for qat and grapes were implemented in
the Sana's basin with close cooperation with the specialists from MAI/DPP.
Awareness and Education: The SMTs held extensive stakeholder consultations, workshops and
focus group meetings during project implementation which created momentum and trust between
the stakeholders and project management.
Institutional Development and Capacity Building: As part of the EMP, a number of institutional
and capacity building initiatives were taken and developed by the project with the concerned
institutions and farmers in the project areas. These included, building the capacity of the NWRA-
SB, assisting the MAI/DPP in developing the pesticides residue testing facilities and
strengthening the EPA in its regulation and enforcement responsibilities.
Environmental Resource Team: An environmental management and monitoring specialist was
seconded from EPA and placed in NWRA-SB. The environmental unit headed by a specialist
from EPA was established and functioning since the commencement of the project activities.
Monitoring the Expansion of Irrigated Land: The SBWMP did not provide services for any
newly developed land, and signed contracts with farmers for non-expansion of the irrigated area
before providing them with modern irrigation systems. There are no evidences of expansion in
the project area or the areas under the WUAs. However, no survey was carried out to confirm the
adherence of the farmers to the tripartite agreement with farmers in the basin.

                                               49
Almost all of the activities under the Component 4 were implemented in a satisfactory manner;
however, the objective of improving the quality of the effluent and sludge from the Sana'a
WWTP was not achieved. The project efforts to design and put in place a red flag warning
system for the direct and indirect users are a positive step but may not be sufficient to mitigate
the environmental risks associated with the by-pass from the WWTP.
Achievements under each Subcomponent of Component 5
Monitoring and Evaluation: The M&E system functioned satisfactorily with quarterly progress
reports produced on a regular basis. The data on the results based indicators was collected and
frequently updated though no field surveys were conducted by the M&E unit.
Financial Management: The finance section discharges its duties satisfactorily as the project
financial management reports were prepared and submitted to the IDA on time. The annual audit
reports were also prepared and submitted to the IDA on time. Post review of the procurement of
goods and civil works by IDA mission showed no violations or deficiencies.

Borrower Performance:
   ·   The Borrower showed continuing political will to address WRM and conservation. This
       is manifested in the preparation and approval of the national water strategy, the
       enactment of the water law, and support the organization of a number of studies and
       workshops that addressed the WRM and conservation.
   ·   The Borrower provided to the PCU adequate local budgets (investment and recurrent
       budgets) which are necessary for the timely implementation of the project activities.
       This ensures the Borrower commitment and ownership of the project.
   ·   The PSC held 52 meetings. During these meetings, the PSC provided the needed
       support to the PCU as well as being responsive to the beneficiaries' and stakeholders'
       demands. The PSC was instrumental in addressing the project concerns objectively and
       responsibly.
   ·   The level of coordination between the PCU and the project implementation partners was
       satisfactory. This level of productive coordination with the project partners contributed
       to the successful implementation of the project activities.
   ·   The IPAC of the project was successful in generating observable changes in the
       behavior of the farming community and other stakeholders towards better understanding
       of the groundwater situation. The farming community in the basin became more aware
       of the scarcity of groundwater in the basin and the necessary mitigation measures to
       address this situation.
   ·   The SMTs was instrumental in establishing 52 WUAs and provided the necessary
       capacity building to these WUAs to play their intended role in participatory
       management of the water resources in the basin. However, the sustainability of these
       WUAs needs more than just capacity building and the Borrower should promote the
       sustainability of the WUAs through self-reliance.

IDA Performance:
   ·   The IDA launched 12 supervision missions, for total period of 3.9 months, during the
       course of project implementation. The missions comprised multi-disciplinary teams of

                                               50
       international experts/consultants (58 Nos.) who provided constructive and instrumental
       recommendations and technical guidance to the PCU.
   ·   The objective flexibility in addressing the project constraints and needs by the IDA was
       an essential factor underlying the satisfactory completion of the project.
   ·   The project design was complex as the project had seven components and their
       implementation required close coordination between the PCU and the other
       implementing partners including departments, directorates from other line ministries.
       "Coordination" would be nice and easy as a slogan but difficult to implement in Yemen
       context.
   ·   The legal covenant that linked the commencement of the civil work of Component 2
       with the improvement of the quality of wastewater sludge to international standard was
       difficult to achieve in a timely manner since this requirement was beyond the authority
       of the PCU. This led to serious delays during the start up of the project activities.

IDA - Borrower Relationship:
   ·   The relationship between the IDA and the Borrower was productive, constructive and
       fruitful in terms of meeting the project needs and ultimately leading to substantial
       achievement of the project objectives.
   ·   IDA missions had been objectively flexible in considering the Borrower's suggestions
       to modify and/or cancel some of the project activities which proved either technically
       not feasible or practically not appreciated by the targeted beneficiaries and the
       stakeholders.
   ·   IDA flexibility is manifested in its agreement to the PSC/PCU and the targeted
       beneficiary's suggestion to modify the mechanism of installation of the improved
       conveyance and localized irrigation systems. The revised installation mechanism led to:
       (i) reducing installation cost; (ii) giving supervisory role to the WUAs in the installation
       process; and (iii) making farmers' contribution in kind (i.e. labor for excavation of
       trenches and back filling). The revised installation mechanism was widely accepted by
       the farming community and led to more adoption of water saving, modern irrigation
       technologies in farmers' fields.
   ·   The IDA agreed to revise the targets of activities under Component 1 two times in
       response to farmers' demands. The revised targets were substantially achieved. This
       flexibility of the IDA significantly contributed to achieving the targets of Component 1.
   ·   The PSC/PCU suggested to the IDA that some structures be cancelled under Component
       2. After IDA experts evaluated such structures, the IDA agreed to cancel those
       structures.
   ·   The PSC/PCU suggested and the IDA agreed to terminate: (i) the drilling contract
       because of the failed drilling of three boreholes in accordance with the specification
       envisaged in the contract; and (ii) the contract of the coordinating consulting firm
       because of deficiency in delivering the contracted services.
   ·   The Borrower requested and the IDA agreed to reallocation of the credit proceeds three
       times during the project implementation (i.e. March 12, 2008, September 22, 2009, and
       March 22, 2010). This clearly reflects IDA's flexibility and understanding of the project
       implementation needs to achieve its objectives.
                                                51
   ·   The Borrower requested and the IDA agreed to extend the project closing date from the
       scheduled date of June 2009 to December 2009 and again to June 30, 2010 to complete
       ongoing works under Component 2 and to meet the high farmers, demand for improved
       conveyance and localized irrigation systems under Component 1. This reflects the
       mutual understanding of the Borrower and the IDA of the project needs.

Sustainability and Future Operation:
   ·   The sustainability of the project activities is very likely, specially the activities of
       Component 1. This is because farmers realized the financial benefits as a result of
       installation of piped conveyance and localized irrigation systems, including savings in
       the pumping (fuel) costs and irrigation labor, and increased crop yields. In addition, the
       increased awareness of farmers about the scarcity of groundwater in the basin has
       prompted them to conserve this vital resource.
   ·   There is considerable farmers' investment in acquiring water saving technologies in the
       basin (improved conveyance and localized irrigation systems). Since a sense of
       ownership by the beneficiaries to these systems has been generated, beneficiaries
       willingly accept the full responsibility to carry out the future maintenance of these
       systems. This reflects the beneficiaries' commitment to future O&M, which leads to the
       sustainability of these systems.
   ·   The formation of the WUAs and their capacity building program are likely to contribute
       to the sustainability of project interventions in the basin. The program included: (i)
       awareness campaign to acquaint the beneficiary farmers with the scarcity of
       groundwater situation in the basin and the potential measures to reduce imminent risks;
       (ii) local training to the members of the WUAs in the form of workshops; and (iii)
       technical training on the maintenance of improved conveyance and localized irrigation
       systems.

Key Lessons Learned:
   ·   Project designs need to be kept simple and in line with administrative capacity in the
       country. The project has diverse components involving the participation of several
       agencies/line ministries. Thus requiring a wide matrix of coordination which did not
       readily exist.
   ·   Legal covenants should be carefully considered and that they should be implementable
       within a reasonable timeframe to avoid enormous implementation delays if not being
       met.
   ·   The critical assumptions at entry should be seriously considered to avoid the unforeseen
       consequences of not being met.
   ·   The national staff from the line ministries should be intensively involved during all
       stages of project preparation (i.e. from project identification, to project appraisal)
       instead of involving national consultants as counterparts to the foreign experts. This is
       important and may have serious implications during the course of project
       implementation.
