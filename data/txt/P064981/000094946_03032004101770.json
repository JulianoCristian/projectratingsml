It applies to private and communal\n            lands or properties affected throughout the Sana'a\n            Basin Water Management Project. In particular, it addresses\n            how the government will identify, mitigate, and compensate\n            any adverse impacts on the assets and liveihoods of the\n            people directly affected by possible expropriations. It is\n            intended to safeguard the interests of the population\n            impacted by the project, especially the poor and vulnerable.\n            This Framework also decribes the required organizational\n            arrangements and design criteria to be applied to\n            subprojects during project implementation and the procedures\n            and content of any abbreviated or full resettlement action\n            plans if and as required. The report also analyzes\n            Yemen's legislation governing property and\n            participation; because of the weakness of the judicial\n            system and the presence and prevalence of tribal law, it is\n            necessary that the framework take the social context into\n            account and adapt it to local conditions. if the proposed\n            sub-project design entails any impacts on land or assets,\n            the design shall be reviewed and revised based on the\n            appropriate and documented consultations with affected\n            persons, and with the aim of avoiding or minimizing\n            expropriation and adverse socio-economic impacts. the\n            submission of a Land Acquisition plan and its approval by\n            the world Bank is a condition that must be met prior to\n            subproject approval and the initiation of any works.\n            Abbreviated resettlement plan procedures shall be made\n            publicly available in Arabic and other media as appropriate,\n            and in locations accessible to the affected people. In cases\n            where a sub-project will incur involuntary resettlement or\n            other significant or large-scale impacts, a full\n            resettlement action plan has to be prepared, which will\n            entail more in-depth studies than in the abbreviated plan.\n            Regardless of the issues of land acquisition or loss of\n            assets, in the Sana'a Basin project consultation with\n            the beneficiaries befire the design of any sub-projects is\n            of critical importance . Because water is a common asset\n            subject to tribal regulations the arrangements and\n            agreements for the use of water from any dams must be\n            settled before any subprojects are developed and approved.\n            There are instances where water from full dams cannot be\n            used because of local disputes over water, thus the social\n            analysis of the customary water tenancy laws must be clear\n            and agreements established before any subproject is\n            approved. The Government will finance the costs of land\n            acquisition and resettlement grants. The IDA loan will cover\n            all other costs linked to resettlement."}, "docdt": "2003-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
