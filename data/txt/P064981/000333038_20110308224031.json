Water\n            Management Project for the Republic of Yemen were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: projects should not underestimate the difficulty\n            in implementing activities in the water sector in Yemen\n            given the number, organizational structure, and weakness in\n            capacity of Government of Yemen (GOY) institutions involved\n            in Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM).\n            Demonstration of new irrigation technologies to improve\n            irrigation efficiency in pilot farms was very effective in\n            expanding modern irrigation in rural Yemen. Projects should\n            avoid establishing legal conditions or requirements that are\n            clearly beyond the scope of the project to deliver. Timely\n            action will have been better in recognizing the need for\n            amending the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) when it was\n            decided (2007) to consider farmer installation of localized\n            irrigation equipment using equipment supply contracts, with\n            outcome-based incentive structure for farmers. This new\n            mechanism for transferring the responsibility of installing\n            conveyance and distribution system to farmers worked very\n            well with improvement in the pace of installation. It is\n            crucial for the Management to be involved in resolving the\n            institutional issues of the Government in the early stage of\n            the project implementation. GOY officials should be fully\n            involved from project identification to appraisal phases.\n            Involvement of national consultants during these stages as\n            counterparts to the foreign consultants would lighten the\n            burden of GOY officials but the chance of on-the-job\n            training of GOY officials would be lost, which would result\n            in delay in project start-up due to lack of capacity."}, "docdt": "2010-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
