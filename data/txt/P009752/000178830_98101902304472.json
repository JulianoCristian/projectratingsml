training and technical\n            assistance. Because the Second Bombay Water Supply and\n            Sewerage Project involves large and complex civil\n            engineering works, there is a risk that temporary shortages\n            of materials, lateness on the part of manufacturers in\n            meeting contractual delivery dates, or lack of management\n            skills on the part of contractors could lead to delays in\n            implementation. However, BMC is expected to be able to\n            minimize the impact of these delaying factors as a result of\n            the experience and improved management techniques it has\n            gained as a result of the first IDA-assisted Bombay Water\n            Supply and Sewerage Project."}, "docdt": "1978-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
