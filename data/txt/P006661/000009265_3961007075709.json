b) to support the\n            Government's privatization efforts in the road sector\n            through the use of global maintenance contracts and\n            promotion of BOT (Build, Operate, Transfer) schemes for\n            private sector financing of road and road-related\n            investments; c) to improve road traffic safety on the\n            national network; and d) to strengthen MOP's\n            environmental impact assessment and monitoring capacity in\n            the road sector. The project consists of: 1) road investment\n            including road widening, road upgrading, construction of\n            bypasses, overpasses and road safety infrastructure, and\n            consulting services for engineering and supervision and\n            preparation of BOT schemes; 2) road maintenance including\n            periodic and routine maintenance works, equipment\n            acquisition, special maintenance operations (tunnels,\n            weighing and toll systems, bridges, riverbank defenses, and\n            road signs), consulting services, and training; and 3)\n            administration of the above components."}, "docdt": "1994-12-02T00:00:00Z"}
