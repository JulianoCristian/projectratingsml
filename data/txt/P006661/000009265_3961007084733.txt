1. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Overview-The Economy
1. 1        The structurl transformation of the Chilean economy has heen nearly two decades
in the making. Since the mid-1980s, the macroeconomic program has brought the country
substantial growth and price stability. During the 1990-93 period, Chile became one of the LtiWn
American countries that most successfully achieved economic reforms, from which the economy
gained noteworthy benefits. On the domestic front, GDP averaged 6.4% annual growth; after
continuously declining, inflation reached an annual rate of 12.2%; and unemployment fell to
4.5% in December 1993, the lowest rate since 1975. Although the public sector balance
weakened on account of falling copper reve..ues and increases in social and capital expenditures,
it continued to register a surplus. On th.e extemal front, the curret account deficit averaged
2.1% of GDP for the period, largely due to falling export prices in 1993. Th balance of
payments continued to register a surplus due to inflows of iong-tern capital an-d direct foreign
investment. As a consequence, the Central Bank accumulated ample reserves of up to US$9.8
billion (equivalent to 10 months of merchandise imports) by the end of 1993. The Chilean
economy has the potential foi sustained growth averaging 5.5%-6% over the next decade,
provided that savings and investment are about 2M% of GDP and there are no major domestic
policy reversals. Exogenous factors such as the international price of copper and movements
in the terms of trade would also take on major importance in influencing growth performance.
B. Infrastructure Investment
1.2           rastucture in Chile experienced during the 1970s a considerable deterioratin
process, especially in roads, ports, railways, water supply/sanitation, and irrgation. Tbis
deterioration process was partally turned around in the mid-1980s, but not to a degree sufficient
to satisfy the growing needs of the rapidly developing economy. To ensure economic growth
and to satisfy basic needs, the government increased capital expenditures during the 1990-93
period, and concentrated on roads, tansportation infrastructure, and sanitary works in rural and
urban areas.
1.3        Infrastructre investment incrased on average by 20%  in real terms as a
consequence of an increase in road construction, tansportation, water and sanitation and
regional/municipal investment. Duing the 1990-93 period, the public sector remained the major
financier of infatructure investment, while private sector investment was negliglible, accounting
for only 4.1 % of the total, mainly in roads, water and sanitation, ports, railways, and airports.
Highway construction took priority over other infrastructure because tmderinvestment in the road
sector caused a low proporto of paved roads and poor road quaity. Average investmnt in
roads by the public sector during 1990-93 accounted for 47.4 % of total irv*astructure investnt
(only 0.3% of the total invested by the private sector). Investment in tansporion, espe y
airports, ports, and railways (public and prvate sector) took second prority, and accounted for
about 8.6% of total infastructure. Water and sanitation investment (combined public and
private sector) accounted for 15.2% of the total. Other infastructure investment (metro, public
buildings, iraon, and others) was financed entirely by the pubLhc sector.

C. Major Developments In the Transport Sector
1.4        Chile has an extensive transport network consisting of 79,000 kilometers of roads,
65900 kIlometers of railway track, 11 major state-owned general cargo seaports and a large
number of specialized and private geneal cargo ports, a 622-kdlometer network of pipelines, and
about 21 commercial airports, of which seven are used for international flights. The tansport
system is dominated by road transport, which carries about two-thirds of domestic freight,
railways hauling around one-fifth, coastal shipping and oil pipelines carrying about one-teth and
air transport handling less than 1%. Some 95% of intenational trade (expressed in tnnage) is
seaborne. Passenger traffic is carried mainly by road.
Government Policy Toward the Transport Sector
1.5        Transport policy-making in Chile is officially the task of the Ministry of Transport
and Telecommunications (KMl). The Ministry of Public Works (MOP) undertakes road
planning and is in charge cf all transport infrastructure except urbar stmets. MOP is also
responsible for collecting road tolls and impleineiring the vehicle weight limit program in close
coordination with the National Police (Carabineros de C7dle). The M{inistry of Housing and
Urban Development (AINVU) bears responsibility for the urban street network nationwide,
except for a cental county in the city of Santiago. The Ministry of Planning and Coordinatio
(MIDEPLAN) updates a rolling three-year plan every year and determines whether proposed
transport investments are justified according to its guidelines as well as whether they fit into the
broader planning framework. Chart 1 of Annex A shows the functions of key govenmnt
agencies in the tranwsport sector.
1.6        From the late 1970s through the early 1990s, the transport sector underwent
considerable restructuring in line with the strongly market-oriented economic policies of the
govemment. Key policy changes in the sector included the elimination of subsidies, most
notably in the railways, and increased private sector participation in investments in and operdon
of ports, airlines, urban transport, and, mast recently, roads. Through this process, opeatonal
efficiency has increased significantly in each of the subsectors.
Roads
1.7         Owing to the countuy's long and narrow configumaon, the road network is
dominated by three major stetches of north-south road almost 5,000 kilometers in length: the
Longitdinal Road from Region I to Region X, the Southern Road from Region X to Region X[,
and Route No. 9 in Region XII. Of fte total of 79,000 kilometers, 13,000 kilometers are paved
either with cement concrete or asphalt (Annex A, Table 1-1, MAP IBRk No. 26278).
1.8        The entire road network is publicly owned and opemted. Nonethes, MOP has
a tradition of conucting out civi works to the privte sector. Today, nearly 100% of new
works and 82% of mainten  is undaken by private coactor. The policy of using
contract maintenance combined with effective seon and incrasasd budgetary allocations



-3 -
to maintenance expenditures resulted in substantial improvements in the condition of the national
network (see para. 1.22).
1.9         MOP has also introduced the use of 'global' maintenance ccntracts, an innovadve
practice of contracting out road maintenance projects to private contractors under area-wide
contracts at the provincial or sub-provincial level. IThis approach has the advantage of
consolidating under a single contract a series of works that would have required a great number
of smaller contracts, thereby reducing the resources needed for their management and
supevision (see para. 2.4).
1.10        In 1991, the Government promulgated a law that makes possible a new form of
public/private partnership in the road sector-the concession of constructio, maintenance and
opertion of toll roads, tunnels and other related infrastructure to the private sector under a BOT
scheme. Under the proposed formula,2 individual toll roads are to be administered by
concessionaires entrusted by MOP for a specified period (20 to 25 years) with the task of
financing, constructing, maintaining and operating those roads and any relatea infrastructure.
At the end of the concession period, the entire structure is to be returned free of charge to thI:
national govemment. The concession would be governed by a contact encompassing technical
standards, financizl terms, areas of activity and duration (see Annex B). It is expected that a
ransition to this system ef road concessions would be reasonably smnooth, given that toll roads
are not a novel concept for Chilean motorists: there are 2,255 kilometers of public toli roads
in use today.
Pori-*
1.11        Chile has more than 5,000 Elometers of coastline with more than 70 cargo port
installations, of which 26 are commercial ports involved in interadonal traffic. Of these, 11
are owned by the Chilean Port Authonty (EMPORCHI), a public enterprise reportng to M1i.
The remainder consist of specialized ports (mainly minerals and petroleum) and a priMely-
owned general cargo port at Lirqudn. In the 1980s, the public ports underwent a series of
institutional restructurings, a major outcome of which was the transfer of all operations (other
than wharfage and storage) at publicly-owned ports to pte stevedoring companies under
concession agreements. EMPORCHI, which retains ownership of port infrastructure,
coordinates the various users of port instaons. The sum result of these reforms is that
efficiency at public ports improved significantly between 1981 and 1989. As a matter of saed
policy, the Governmnt encourages maximum private participation in the expansion of port
capacity, limiting its own role primarily to rehabilitation and maintenance of publicly owned
facilities. Public investment in additional port capacity is to be made only when private capital
is not forthcoming.

Railways
1.12        The railway system in Chile consists of several independent mining-company-
owned railways, the privately-owned Antofagasta-Bolivia Railway (721 ian), the small state-
owned FERRONOR (2,240 km), and the State Railway Company (EFE), (3,273 Ian) which
covers the remainder of the network. Railway traffc, of which freight accounts for 70%, has
been declining in importance during the last two decades. However, viable operations are
possible in EFE's southern network for products such as logs, copper, coal, steel and cellulose.
1.13        In the early 1970s, EFE was large, overstaffed, and financially troubled, run on
large national government subsidies of as much as US$50 million a year. After 1973, vigorous
reforms of the railway system were initiated. The measures adopted in the period between 1973
and 1990, including increases in tariffs and the elimination of subsidies, a reduction in staff, the
phasing out of uneconomic lines, contracting out of some maintenance work to private
contractors, and the sale of unremunertive assets, helped significantly to streamline EFE's
operations, reduce costs, and improve its financial position. However, in 1990 the railway had
accumulated a debt of more than US$10 billion.
1.14        Under the Government which took office in 1990, a decision was rmade by the
executive and legislative branches of government to privatize the railway sector. The approach
taken by the Government, and supported by a law approved in August 1992, was to vertically
separate the physical network from services and to give current and future private operators
equal access to the existing rail infrastructure. Under this scheme, EFE would own the paysical
network (tracks and stations), and freight and passenger services would be sold off to private
companies. These companies would either own or lease the rolling stock and compete in the
running of these operations. Bids have been let for freight service; however, there would be
little interest in the non-profitable passenger services. If there are no offers from the private
sector, what remains of the passenger service would lilely remain with EFE.
Urban Transport
1.15        Urban transport in Chile includes private automobiles, private buses, shared and
regular taxis, a private trolley bus system in Santiago and Valparaiso, bicycles (whose use the
Government is encouraging) and a metro in Santiago, which is the oniy publicly-owned and
operated urban tranwsport service in Chile. In the late 1970s, the Government deregulated urban
transport almost enirely. As a direct consequence of this deregulation, there have been
significant new enties in all market segments-buses, niicrobuses, taxibuses and shared
taxis-with smaller vehicles increasing their market shares. The resultant congestion, surplus
seating capacity in buses and the metro, pollution and excessive use of fuel have prompted the
present Govemment to consider stronger measures to integrat the various urban transport modes
and discourage unneeded buses in cental areas. Already, in the winter months, private vehicle
access to downtown Santiago is regulated by license number. In April 1992, the Government
auctioned off bus routes to a smaller number of private operators in order to reduce the number
of buses and raise occupanay rates. Implementation of this new system since October 1992 has



brought about a reduction of the bus fleet (13,000 to ll ,000 units), its significant mod n,
and a reduction of fares in constant terms. The Govemment is also exploring the feasibility, in
the longer run, of using congestion pricw.g to regulate the volume of tffic in downtown areas.
D. Issues In the Road Sector
Road Infrsructure Deficiedcies and Funding Shortfalls
1.16        Chile faces a deficit in infrastrcture in general and in roads in pardcular. Large
stretches of the national network are heavily travelled and in need of major improvements
(i.e., cnanges in construction standards). Moreover, demand for investnents on the main tunk
and latzal roads is ily to increase: within l0 to 20 years these roads would have to be
converted to expressway standards (dual cariageway expressways with full access control).
Acccs control significantly reduces accidents, increases capacity and allows higher safe speeds
(see paras. 1.18, 1.19). About 700-800 klometers of highways in the central part of Chile have
traffic volumes fast approaching levels high enough to justify upgrading them to expressways
(Tsble A-2). This includes about 500 Iklometers of the north-south highway (Route 5) from El
Mel6n to Chin, and ftree or four of the most impotant east-west laterals, such as Route 68
from Santao to Valparso and the beaches in and near Vifia del Mar, Route 78 from Santiago
to the port of San Antonio, Route 60 from Vifta del Mar to La Calera, and Route 148 from
Chilldn to Concepci6n. In the next four years, the Ministry esimates that at minimum, annual
fundig would need to average US$500 million (1994 prices) to accommodate tee road
improvement and upgradng requirements whie fully meetng maintenance needs. Given the
competig demands on public funds, however, it is by no means certain that these allocati
would be approved in full by the Ministry of Finance.
1.17        In this context, the Government has initiated a private highway concessions
program to capumre new sources of fnancing for infastructure investment (see para. 1.10). If
the concessionaires can finance their projects in the private capital market and repay thdr
investors without recourse to scarce tax resources, total investnent in the highway sector can
be increased without raising additional taxes or increasing public sector debt. Equally important,
the concessionaires are able to tap a new pool of private sector alent to manage the constuctio,
maintenance, and operatio of their proects. If private manement increases the effiiency
with which new infsuctre is bilt and operd to improve general productivity, the
probability would increase that the new infrstructure could be financed without othwise
straining the Chilean economy.
Deteriorting Road Taffic Saety
1.18        Chile's rapid economic devlopment, accom d by steady growth in
motorization (see Table 1.1), has put a strain on the country's road infrastucr, manifested
in part by a marlkd d         in road safety. Table 1.2 below shows tt the rate of
motorization has risen steadily since the md-1980s, and with the risk of road fhtality gowing
even more rapidly during this period. Road tafic safety is ft becoming a major sci

concem in Caile. Presently, traffic accidents constitute the third leading cause of deat.
Nationwide, in 1992, Chile registered one road accident cvery 12 minutes, one serious injury
every 42 ninutes, and one road fatality every 5 hours. It ic estimated that th- cost (direct and
indirect) of road accidents in monetary terms amounted to US$150 million in 1992.3

a consistent nadO'nal road safety program. Reponsibites and functions assodated with road

and norms for road safety. The National Police (see pam. 1.5) enforces traffic regultions,
maintains and monitors information on road accidents, and carries out public education
campaigns. MOP and MJNVU are responsible for incorpoating road safety features in their
investments in national networks and urban streets, respectively. In addition, a number of
private organizations are active in dnver and road safety education. Most of these insttut
discharge their responsiblities conscientiously in their respective areas, but cooperation and
coordination among them tend to be poor.
1.20        To prvide the needed coordination to strehgthen national road safety effort, the
Government created (through Decree 223, December 27, 1993), an nter-ministeral National
Commission on Traffic Safety presided over by fte Minister of Trnsport and
Telecommuimcations, assisted by an Executive Secretariat, which is Integrated by eiht
interdisciplinary professonals. Mixed work groups with professionals of other ministries are
already taclding speialzed subjects such as the transport of habrdous matials, rescue
coordination, and licensing. lme Executive Secretariat is also in charge of the  pementaion
of the Road Safety Diagnosis Study, initiated under the Second Road Sector Project (Loa 3120-
CIfI).
E Road Sector Expendture Progm and Cost Recovery
1.21        Table 1.3 below shows MOP's road expenditures since 1985 expressed in current
US dollars. Total expenditures in the road sector rose from US$175 million in 1985 to US$427
million in 1994. A notable and encouraging irend in the Ministry's expenditure program is the
rapid increase in the share of mintece spending, which more than doubled from 27.2%
of total road expenditures in 1985 to an average of 59% in the period 1988-94.  This timid
reflects an explicit policy on the part of MOP (supported by the Bank's First and Second Road
Sector Projects) to corect an earlier bias toward new constcion. The underfni  of
maintenance acdtvities in the past resulted in the need for cosdy rehabilitain worlk from the
1970s through the first half of the 1980s (see Table 1.3 and pam 1.23).

construction of bypasses and urban overpasses, and completion of the southern road program);
reconstuction (already referred to in para. 1.21); and upgading (consisting mainly of paving
primary gravel roads with taffic of more than 300 vehicles per day). In recent years, MOP has
been spending US$15-30 million annually to build a second carriageway on heavily traveUlled
stretches of Route 5 and an additional US$15-20 million per year on bypasses for secondary
cities, grade separations, and other miscellaneous improvements. These investments, however,
have not kept pace with the growth of traffic in the national network over this period. This has
resulted in congestion and road safety problems in the central parts of the country.
1.24        Cost recovery in the road sector is fully atsfactory. Total revenues from road
user charges comprise fuel aes, road tolls, and vehicle registraion fees. As seen in Table 1.3

more than doubling total road xpenditures over this period.

F. Expeience with Previous Ba;Lk Lending in the Road Sector
Lending Objectives
1.25        The Bank has provided assistance to Chile's roads subsector since 1961, through
one credit and seven loans totalling US$540 million4 (Annex C). This long history can be
divided into two distinct phases. The first four lending operations (1961-79) were characteized
by implementation difficulties, slow execution of works and cost overruns, while the last four
projects (1980-93) were implemented effectively at significantly lower cost and in a timely
manner, fully meetng their objectives.
1.26       The focus of Bank operations in Chle's roads sector has changed over the years.
The earliest projects emphasized basic construction and reconstruction of roads devastated by
natural disaster, as well as on introducing an effective maintenance program (Highway
Maintenance Project, Loan 287-CH, and Highway Construction Project, Credit 4-CH). The
subsequent Second Highway Maintenance Project (Loan 558-CH) developed the Bank's new
focus on implementing sound maintenance operations, while through the Second Road
Construction Project (Loan 688-CH) road construction and reconstruction efforts continued.
Despite these efforts, throughout the 1970s highway maintenance activities were seriously
neglected by the Government, necessitating a major, if temporary, shift in project focus toward
highway reconstruction (First and Second Highway Reconstruction Projects, Loans 1927-CH and
2297-CH), though the Bank's overaU goal continued to be improved maintenance operations.
As reconstruction efforts progressed in the restoration of the basic network to an acceptable
level, in the mid-1980s the focus of Bank operations began a return to the institutional
strengthening of MOP's Roads Directorate (First and Second Road Sector Projects, Loans
2589-CH, and 3120-CE. In conjunction with this goal, Bank operations have supported a shift
in the execution of maintenance activities from force account to private contracting, as well as
the promotion of maintenance and road pavement technology.
Lessons from Past Lending Operations
1.27       Lessons learned from the 25-year history of Bank lending to Chile's road sector
have substantially evolved over the years. The PPARs for the Second Highway Maintenance
Project (Loan 558-CH) and for the Second Highway Construction Project ( Loan 688-C
concluded that in.plementation of these projects had been affected and delayed by the politl
and economic instability of the country in the early 1970s, lack of Government commitment,
inadequate financing (particularly for road maintenance), weak planning, and insufficient
training.
1.28       By contrast, the recent consolidated Project Audit Report on the Highway
Reconsction Project Loan 1927-CE), the Second Highway Reconstruction Project
(Loan 2297-CI), and the First Road Sector Project (Loan 2589-CH) concluded that the he
projects have fully attained their objectives, that they belong to the very best series of road
sector operations analyzed in recent years, and that overall outcomes were highly satisfactory,
institutional development was substantial, and sustainability is likely. It fiuther states that the
excellent project results are attributable to several factors:

- 10-
(a) strong and exemplary commitment by the Govemment, sector institutions and
beneficiaries;
(b) consistent project design, based on relevancy and feasibility of project
components;
(c) effective Borrower-Bank relationship and quality and continuity of Bank
project staff; and
(d) favorable macroeconomic conditions.
1.29       Implementation of the Second Road Sector Project (Loan 3120-C  was completed
saisfaorily according to schedule on December 31, 1993, achieving works execution of about
20% above agreed tgets. However, the positive development of the Chilean economy and the
substantial exason of foreign investment during project inplementation resulted in an
unexpectedly strong flow of foragn currency into the country, which motivated the Government
to take several measures to reduce foreign indebtedness and curtail internal inflaton.
Simultaneously, the Government carried out successfuly a reform of the intrnal revenue
system, which increased substantially the availability of local funding. In accordance with its
policy of strict control of Government expenditures, the administration dedded not to increase
its expenditures, but to replace foreign with local financing. As a result of this macroeconomic
policy, the Government decided to replace foreign financing by surplus local financing duting
the last two years of project implementation, resulting in an accumulation of an undisbursed loan
balance of US$43.8 million., which was cancelled, at the Government's request June 22, 1994.
An Implementadon Completion Report (ICR) on this project is in preparation; however, it can
already be stated that the excellent results of this project are attibutable to the same factr
listed above.

2. THE PROJECT
A. Pioject Origin and Objectives
2.1         The strongly market-oriented economic policies adopted by the Government in the
1970s have tansformed policies and practices in the road sector. Key policies of MOP that have
chamacterized its market-oented approach since the 1980s include: (a) the almost complete
reliance on private contractors for construction and maintenance acvities-the use of force
account by MOP has declined progressively from 65% in 1980 to 10% in 1993; and (b)
promotion of private sector participation in the financing and opewation of road infrastructure.
At the same time, MOP recognizes the need to (c) strengthen its capacity and activities in areas
where the public sector must maintain primary responsibility, such as road safety and
environmental protection. MOP has requested Bank assistance for a project designed to support
these priorities.
2.2         The proposed project will, accordingly, seek to consolidate MOP's remarkable
progress in road maintenance adminitation (see Annex D) while Introducing additional polic
and insttional objectives. The objectives of the proposed project are: (a) to consolidate the
road m    nce and pavement              program financed under the First and Second
Road Sector Projects; (b) to support the Government's priatitlonefforts In the road setor
through (i) the use of "global"  nnce contracts and (ii) promotion of BOT schemes for
private sector financing of road and road-related investments; (c) to improve road traffic safety
on the national network; and (d) to strengthen MOP's environmental hnpact assment and
monitoring capacity in the road sector.
2.3         The consolidation of the road maintenance and pavement management
program will be accomplished by providing technical assistance and/or spialized key
equipment and fiurther training for the improvement of the maintenance contracting system, the
upgrading and fiuther expansion of the pavement management system, the modeon of the
weighing, toll and tnnel control systems, and the continuation of the cost accounting system for
force account maintenance operations.
2.4         The use of multi-year "global" conracts covering road maintenance acvities
for the entire network within specific areas will be expanded and upgraded to increase efficency
by allowing private contractors a longer dme horizon for planning and financing their activities,
and for acquiring speialzed equipment to improve pucvity. This type of contract, manapd
at province and subprince levels, also has the advantage of filiting the involvement of local
authorities in management and possEly co-financing, thereby expediting the proce  of
decentralizing maintenance responsibilities to local governments. After epimentng with ix
pilot one-year contracts followed by six ongoing two-year, unit cost contracts (see Annex B),
MOP plans to progress to multi-year "global" lump sum contracts suprised through compliance
with quality standards.



- 12 -
2.5         With respect to BOT concessions, MOP is expected to do some basic groundwork
to persuade the private sector that these projects could yield attractve returns and that the risk
are manageable. It is MOP which must identify candidate projects within the context of its
sectoral planning and programming priorities, based particulariy on clear analyses of the relafive
merits and demerits of building new expressways versus upgading existing alignments to new
standards. The regulatory framework, as laid out in the bidding documents, must be consstent
and clear. Tbe private fims also will require reliable basic information on identified projects
that are based on well-designed feasibility and basic engineerng studies. The proposed project
will assist MOP in carying out these multiple assignments.
2.6         Privatization in the road sector will enhance the critical importar:ce of the
Govemment's planning, coordination and regulatory fnctions. The proposed priject will
support MOP in two key areas of public action: the introduction and implementation of a road
traffic safety program on the national network and the strengthening of MOP's environ t
impact assesment and monitoring capacity.
2.7         Some 80% of reported traffic accidents occur an urban streets that fall within the
judsdiction of MINVU. At the same time, it is of serious concern to MOP that more than 50%
of deaths due to road accidents occur on the national road network under its responsibility. The
road safety program being formulated by MOP is limited to the national network, and attack
the traffic problems on three fronts: elimination of hazardous areas (black spots) thrugh the
c, A works program, improvement of road sips, marldng and lighting, and st ng of
coordination with the Executive Sectariat of the National Commission on Traffic Safety and
with the Nadonal Police. This program, while modest in scope, is intended to be the first in a
series of road safety initiatives that can be developed into a national program in collaboration
with MTI, MINVU, and other agencies responsible for various facets of traffic safety issues
(see Annex F).
2.8         Currently, environmental impact assessment studies for MOP's road works are
carned out by the Environmental Unit (UMA) located withn the Subdirectorate of Developm
in close coordination with the Environmental Technical Unit in the General Directoate of PubLHc
Works (UTMA), under the general oversight of the National Environmental Commission
(CONAMA). The objective of the project's environen' hipact asessment and monioring
component is to further improve MOP's institutional capacity for environmental work,
specfically to enhance the quality of its environmental impact studies and strengthen the
necessary linkages between the studies and the execution of works (see pam. 2.19 and
Annex G).
B. Rationale for Bank Involvement
2.9         The Bank's First and Second Road Sector Projects have been instrumental in
introducing sound road maintenance and pavement management practis to MOP."' t
proposed operation will first seek to consolidate the gains made under the two earlier projec
by futher advancg the use of the pavement management sytem and by promoting t'gobsWl

road maintenance (see paras. 1.9 and 2.4). Second, the Bank is in a good position to support
the Government's efforts to secure private financing of road construction and opetation. The
Ban'k can make a meaningful contribution in this area after having had the experene of
administering the ongoing Japanese-funded technical assstance program for strengthening the
legal, financial and institutional framework for road concessions in Chile. Third, the Bank will
bring to the project its international experience in the planning and implementation of road saft
measures. Fourth, the Bank intends, through this project, to play a catalytic role in
coordinang the many government agencies assocated with road safety that tend to operte
independently without adequate collaboraon among them (see para. 1.19).
C. Project Description
2.10       The proposed loan will assist MOP in the implementation of its proposed 1995-
1998 Road Investment and Maintenance Program amounting to US$1.94 billion, which is shown
in Table A-8. The proposed loan of US$120 million wil finance only specific key innovatve
subcomponents of the program involving the applicadon of modern techniques, specaled
equipment or advanced know-how, closel asociated with the policy and institutional objectives
specified above. These Bank-Ananced subcomponents are described in detail in paragraphs 2.16-
2.20 below when discussing the project financing scheme. A general description of the project
components follows.
2.11        Road Investment (40.6% of total project cost) includes road widening, road
upgrading, construction of bypasses, overasses and road safety infrastructure, and consg
services for engineering and supervision and preparation of BOT schemes. Road
(52.5% of total project cost) includes periodic and routine maintenance works, equipmnt
acquisition, special maintenance operations (tunnels, weighing and toll systems, bzidges,
nverbank defenses, and road signs), consulting services, and ang. Ad tionamount
to 6.9%, of which 2.8% corresponds to investment and 4.1% to maintenance.
D. Project Cast and  inacing
2.12        The total project cost (Table 2.1), including about US$330 million in identfible
taxes and duties and US$136 million in price contingencies, amounts to US$2,075 milion. Of
this, the total foreign exchange component accounts for US$1.03 billion (50%). The project
base costs by year are shown in Table A-8. The cost esdmates for invesments in civil waot
are based on quanity esumates and current uimt pnces and are considered reasonable under the
standards proposed and the taffic expected. The mantenance cost estmates are based on a
sampling of recent contracts for similar progrms by region. The cost of consultmcy SW
under each component is based on MOP's recent experience in contracting Chilean consults
for engineering and supervision services, and on prevailing fees for Chilean and intena
consultants for a variety of other services. The cost of training was estimated from detied
costing of traning activities by component, based on MOP's recent experience.



- 14-
2.13         To esdmate the foreign exchange cost of civil works, MOP utilized a computer
program that calculates the foreign exchange cost for typical operations or programs on the basis
of the established foreign cost for individual construction or maintenance items. The foreign
exchange cost for consultant services was estimated cnder the assumption that contracts woud
normally be awarded to local firms with limited participation by foreign consultants. For goods
to be procured under the proposed project, the foreign exchange cost has been estmated at 72%,
based on the cost, insurance and freight (CIF) prices at port of entry into Chile, and payment
by MOP of import duties, customs clearance alid port costs, and value-added tax (VAT). The
value-added tax of 18% was also applied to all civil works and consultant service contracts,
foreign and local.

2.14         No physical contngencies have been proUded beuse of the sectwal nature of
the project and its relatively short implementation period. Any physical contingencies will be
accommodated by reducing the planned physical works under the program as necessary. Price
contingencies, amounting to 7% of total project cost, have Leen detmined on the basis of
prevailing estimates of intemaional inflation: 3.4% for 1994, 2.0% for 1995, 2.5% for 1996,
2.7% for 1997, 2.5% for 1998, and 2.6% for 1999.



2.15        The summary project financing plan is presented in Table 2.2 below. The
proposed Bank loan of US$120 million represents 6% of total project cost and 12% of the
estmated foreign exchange cost. The remaining foreign exchange, and the local costs, including
US$330 million in tes and duties, will be financed by the Government.  The detailed
fnancing plan of lhe project (rable A-9) shows the subcomponents to be financed under the
proposed project, which can be grouped and costed by objectives, as described in paragaphs
2.16-2.20.

2.17        Road Safety subcomponents including: (a) civil works for: (i) construction of
bike paths, pedestrian overpasses, sidewalks, guardrails and barriers, and improvement of
intsecions intended to reduce hazardous locaons (black spots) in the national network
(US$53.1 million), and Ai) provision and maintenance of road signs, marldngs, and lighting

information and preparation of public road safety educaton and enforcement campaigns. TMe
scope and content of the road safety subcomponent were agreed at negotiations.
2.18        Support to BOT Schemes (US$2.5 million), comprising quality control of
feasibility studies and basic engineering studies for projects identified by MOP as candidates for
sector concessions, as well as consultant services associated with the ongoing review of the
regulatory framework and the promotion of individual concession schemes. During negoaions,
agreement was reached on the program of studies to be financed in support of future road
concession programs.
2.19        Environmental hnpact Assessment and Mouitoring (US$0.5 miion),
comprising consultant services and training for (i) improving the guidelines and methodologies
for classification and mitigation of environmental impacts; (ii) strengthening the environmental
supervision of road works and extending it to road operations and to the road concession
program; (iii) preparing an Environmental Data Bank to be linked to the existing Geographic
Information System; and (:v) establishing Task Agreements with other public and private
organizations. These arrangements were confirmed at negotiations.
2.20        Training, comprising: (a) a nadonal training program (US$2.8 million) which
will continue the successful training efforts implemented under the First and Second Road Sector
Projects, complemented by special courses on modemn maintenance techniques, road safety,
envmronmental impact and BOT schemes; and (b) technical and study visits abroad for MOP
managers and professionals (US$0.5 million) (See Annex H). Agreement was reached at
negotiations on the size and content of the training program.
E. Economic Evaluation
2.21        Ihe economic evaluations carried out by MOP for more than 200 subprjets to
be included in the road investment component (40.7% of the project's base cost) yield an
individual IERR from 18% to well above 55%. An economic analysis of the project's road
maintenance component has been carried out (paras. 2.22 and 2.23). This component accounts
for 52.5% of the project base cost and absorbs 79% of the loan financing. However, as
described in parms. 2.1-2.9, the project will also support the Govemment's key policy objeces
of promoting privatizaon and road safety, and will contribute to insitutional strengthening i



- 17 -
areas such as environmental protection. Consequently, the project's benefits will significantly
exceed the estimated returns on activities included in the 1995-1998 program.
2.22        The economic analysis for the main categories of the maintenance program was
carried out by staff of the Ministry of Public Works using the Bank's Highway Design and
Maintenance Standards Model, version PM (HDM-III),5 on the Chilean national road network
of 75,588 kilometers, excluding 3,835 K, imaters of cement concrete roads. The HDM-M
model cannot be used for the concrete surface roads because it does not have submodels to
simulate rigid pavement deterioration. Accordingly, the analysis on concrete roads was made
using a separate model developed for the Ministry of Public Works by the University of Chile.
2.23        The HDM model is designed to predict the life-cycle costs of different road design
and maintenance options, including different time staging strategies for a specific road, or for
groups or links of an entire road network. It generates cost figures for large numbers of
altemative maintenance policies on a year-by-year basis, and can therefore be used to identify
alternatives with the highest net present value (NPV) at given discount rates or the highest
intemal economic rate of return (IERR). The objective is to come up with a combination of
maintenance policies that results in the lowest life-cycle costs to society, both to road users and
road authorities. Vehicle speeds and operating costs and road deterioration and maintenance
costs are generated by the model as a function of a given set of road design and maintenanMe
standards, traffic volume, axle loads, and environmental conditions. The procedure for
evaluating Chile's network with HDM is descibed in detail in Annex I. The IERR of the 1995-
98 maintenance program is estimated at 55%, and the NPV at US$1,904 million. The IERRs
and NPVs of different categories of the 1995-98 maintenance progm  are shown in Table I-1.
F. Environmental Impact
2.24        MOP and the Roads Directorate, in particular, have shown an impressive
performance in the assessment, prevention, or mitigation of environmental impacts (see Annex
F). A Bank mission in July 1992 made an assessment of the Roads Directorate's institudonal
capacity to carry out impact studies and monitorng and made recommendations to strengthen
its organiztional structure, prcedures, and training. Subsequently, MOP commissioned its
own study on ways to strengthen its institutional capacity for environmental work. The pos-
appraisal mission of July 1994 established ta the Roads Directorate has implemented the above
recommendations, substantially upgraded its environmental impact assessment and prevention
capacity, and routinely conducts environmental assessments of projects. Further strengthenig
is to be provided under the proposed project (para. 2.19). Consequently, it can be reasonably
expected that environmental risks will be satisfactorily addressed under the proposed prqjecL
H UDM-Hf for Pdoal Comput_ adaptd to Chbea conditn



- 18 -
2.25        Most civil works involved in the proposed project (doubling exiting two-lane
paved roads to four lanes, paving existing gravel roads, construction of bypasses and overpasses,
and general road maintenance works) have a low environmental impact. The exceptions to this
are new construction subprojects of: (a) a few penetration roads in the south, and (b) some major
road works in suburban areas with high-risk potential for acoustic contamination and negative
impact on land-use and population. Although these subprojects will not be financed by the
Bank, it was agreed at negotiation that the Road Directorate will provide the Bank an
opportunity to comment on them.
G. Project Benerits and R;sks
2.26        The project will improve road maintenance by further increasing pnvate sector
participation in the road sector and strengthen the institutional capacity of MOP in key areas of
public action that will assume increasing importance with greater private sector
participation-road safety measures, and the assurance of environmentally benign engineering
designs, as well as environmental impact assessment and monitoring. The resulting reduction
of transport costs and economic losses will benefit the Chilean economy and increase the
international competitiveness of Chilean products. Reduced deaths and injuries from traffic
accidents resulting from the project's road safety component would be another important benefit.
2.27        There are no major risks associated with the project. MOP's Roads Directorate
has a proven record of good implemention, and its firm commitment to sound road
naintenance policies and practices has been evident under earlier Bank-financed rcad projects.
The 1995 Road Ivestmere and Maintenance budget has already been approved and is in
compliance with the amounts established in the agreed 1995-1998 Program. At negotiations the
Government confirmed that allocations for maintenmce in the years 1996 to 1998 will not be
less than the amounts agreed for these years in the 1995-1998 Road Investment and Maintenance
Program. With respect to road concessions, while BOT is a new concept, an adequate legal,
financial and institutional framework is already in place. There are some uncertainties related
to the road safety component, since this is an area where institutional responsibilities are
fragmented, and coordination may be difficult. it will be possible to minimize risks by ting
a phased approach to the development of a national road safety program, with the road safety
component under this project representing a first phase focused on MOP and its national
network, to be expanded in scope under subsequent operation_ Bank support to the road safety
component will also contribute to minimize these risks.

3. PROJECT IMPLMENTATION
A. Organization and Execution
3.1         MOP has a strong and effective organization that has benefitted from a personnel
policy that has ensured stability and condnuity while keeping the work force as small as
possible. Project exocudon will be the responsibility of MOP's Roads Directorate which has
five operational subdirectorates-Development, Works, Urban Road Works, Maintenance and
Administraion. The Works Subdirectorate will execute road safety inftastructure works. The
Maintenance Subdirectorate will have responsibility for overseeing the project's maintenan
subcomponent (including road safety) while the Directorate's 13 regional offices will be in
charge of implementation. The environmental subcomponent will be administered by the
Development Subdirectorate. The newly-created Concession Department within MOP's Geneal
Directorate of Public Works will administer the road concession subcomponent in close
coordination with the Roads Directorate. The Training Unit will be in charge of traing.
Following the successful practice adopted under the First and Second Road Sector Projects, the
Roads Directorate's Foreign Loans Department will serve as the overall project coordination
office. Charts 2 and 3 of Annex A show the organization of the Ministry and the Roads
Directorate.
3.2         The Roads Directorate has a staff of some 4,900, of whom 630 are at
professional levels (about 500 are engineers). Preetly, some 1,100 govemnment workers are
engaged in road maintenance activities under force account (approximately 10% of the total
maintenance budget), however, this work force is aepected to decline significantly over the net
several years through attrition. Today, 100% of new constrction work is executed thrugh
contract. The Roads Directorate's policy is to continue to increase the share of contract
maintenance, thereby making an orderly tansition to full contract maintenance.
B. Procurement and Consultancy Services
3.3         All procurement related to the project components financed exclusively by the
Govemment (about 87% of total project cost) will be carried out by MOP following the same
procedures used sucssfully for all procuranent under the last three Bank projects, with an
international competitive bidding (ICB) threshold of US$5 million for civil works and
US$300,000 for goods. All civil works and 43% of goods contract above these thresholds are
of a traditional naure and will not be financed by the Bank, but bidding will nevertheless be
open to foreign firms.
3.4         Table 3.1 summaizs  the prcurement arrangements under tis proecL
Procurement of Bank-financed works and goods will be carried out in a manner consist wifth
Bank Guidelines (May 1992). ICB procedures will be used for goods purchases costg
US$300,000 and more, totalling about US$10 million, for which MOP will use the standard
bidding documents issued by the Bank, with such modificaionas the Bank may agree to be
necessary for the purposes of the proect



-20 -
3.5         Works contracts costing between US$300,000 and US$5 million, totalling about
US$227 million, and goods contracts costing between US$50,000 and US$300,000, totalling
about US$7.8 million, will be procured through local competitive bidding (LCB) arrangements
satisfactory to the Bank. For these LCB procedures, MOP will use standard bidding documents
similar to those used effectively in the past under Bank-financed projects,with successful
participation of foreign bidders. Works and goods contracts costing less than the above LCB
limits will be procured on the basis of intemational or local shopping, including a minimum of
three quotations from qualified contractors or suppliers, subject to an aggregate limit of about
US$20 million for works and US$2 million for goods.
3.6         Consulting services to be financed by the Bank, totalling about US$8.6 million,
will be contracted in accordance with Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (August 1981).
using the Bank's Standard Form for Contracts for Consultant Services for complex time- based
contracts, and a simplified form for other consulting contracts.
3.7         Most of the civil works contr.:ts financed by the Bank are expected to be for
small maintenance works scattered throughout the country over a four-year period. The size and
pa- kaging of these contracts were agreed at negotiations taldng into account network, geography
and other local conditions. Goods account for less than 6% of items funded under the proect,
and are limited to miscellaneous state-of-the-art maintenance equipment that would probably
benefit from being procured through ICB, as well as computers and miscellaneous equipment
associated with road safety and traffic measurement, and equipment for modernization of toll
stations and vehicle weight control stations, which will be procured through ICB or LCB
procedures. Maintenance equipment totaling about US$15 million will be financed exclusively
by MOP.
3.8         Based on the large number of similar or repetitive contracts and on the experience
and capability of the Borrower in procurement matters demonstrated through successful
implementation of the last four loans, the following procurement review arrangements were
agreed at negotiations. Prior review and approval by the Bank will be required for, (a) all
goods contracts and work contacts (if any) to be tendered under ICB procedures; (b) the first
two contracts for civil works estimated to cost more than US$300,000; and (c) all documentation
for consulting ser"ices to be financed by the Bank, esdmated to cost US$100,000 or more for
firms and US$50,OUO or more for individual consultants, and for the first two that are estimated
to cost less than these amounts. In addition, the Bank will review on ex-post basis, according
to paragraph 3 of Appendix 1 to the Bank procurement guidelines (i.e. before submission of the
first withdrawal application), all civil works contracts valued at US$2.0 million or more. These
review arrangements will cover about 50% of the total value of contracts financed by the Bank.

C. Disbursements
3.9        The proceeds of the proposed loan will be disbursed according to the folUowing
categories and percentages
Amount of the               % of Expenditures
Cay           Ion Allocated                 IQ be Fianced.
(1) Civil Workcs      98,700,000                      40%
(2) Goods              14,000,000    100% of foreign expenditures, 100% of the ex-
factory cost of locally produced goods and 70%
of other locally produced goods.
(3) Consultant         6,800,000    100% of foreign expenditures and 80% of local
Services                        expenditures
(4) Training             500,000    100% of foreign expenditures.
TOTAL                 120,000,000
3.10       The closing date for project disbursements will be June 30, 1999. On the basis
of MOP's excellent implementation performance under earlier Bank-financed road sector loans,
it is anticipated that full disbursement will be achieved within the programmed four-year
implementation period. The estimated schedule of disbursements is given in Table A-10.
3.11        Considering MOP's impressive record in contracting and disbursement, it was
agreed to continue to use the approach that has worked well in the past. Withdrawals from the
Loan Account will be made on the basis of statements of expendiur  for expenditures under
contracs costing less than US$300,000 for goods, US$5,000,00 for works, US$100,000 for
consulting firms and US$50,000 for individual consulants. Supporting documentation will not
be submitted to the Bank. Instead, it will be retained by MOP and made available for review
during project supervision and audits. However, civil works contracts valued at US$2.0 million
or more will be reviewed ex-post by the Bank before submission of the first withdrawal
application for each contract. These arrangements and other disbursement related matters were
agreed at negotations.
3.12       To maintain an adequate flow of funds to finance eligible project expenditures
with a minimum of adminisve delay, the Government will establish a Special Account in the
Central Bank, or a commercial institution acceptable to the Bank, under terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank. Upon the Government's request, the Bank will deposit an aggregate
amount equivalent to a maximum of US$10 milLion (or the equivalent of 4 months' estimated
expenditures) from the loan account into the Special Account Records of the Special Account
proceeds and oudays will be available for annual audits (see pam. 3.14).

D. Accounts and Auditing
3.13        The Bank will require that an independent auditor: (a) undertake an annual audit
of all project accounts in a timely manner; (b) consistently apply procedures and methodologies
conforming to generally accepted auditing standards acceptable to the Bank; and (c) render an
impartial judgment in its auditing role. In past Bank-financed road projects, the Comptroler
General's Office (Contralor(a General de la Repdblica) satisfactorily fulfilled the funcion of
independent auditor. During negotiations, it was agreed tat Contralorfa could be the auditor
of the project accounts as long as it continues to meet the Bank's criteria of independence,
quality and timeliness.
E. Monitoring and Evaluation
3.14        Under this project, the Roads Directorate will prepare and send to the Bank
quarterly progress reports starting May 15, 1995. In terms of their scope and content, the
reports will be modeled on the quarterly reports for the first two road sector projects, which
have proven fully effective for project supervision. To monitor progress towards project
objectives, it was agreed that annual reviews will be held starting July 1995 to focus, in
particular, on:
(a) size of the Govemment's annual budgetary allocation for the subsequent year;
(b) status of implementation of the road investment and maintenance program;
(c) compliance with efficiency indicators and monitoring targets (Annex J);
(d) selection and status of Bank-financed subprojects;
(e) status of disbursements;
(f) road condition inventones (biannually in odd-numbered years);
(g) implementation of the trining component;
(h) progress in the execution of specific studies;
(i) progress on otlzar TA components; and
0) audit reports and consolidation of disbursement records against actual
expenditures.

F. Agreements Reached and Recommendation
3.15       During negotiations, agreements were reached on the following issues:
(a) a detailed 1995 road maintenance program including activities programmed
under global maintenance (para. 2.16);
(b) scope and content of the road safety program (para. 2.17);
(c) program of studies to be financed in support of future road concession
programs (para. 2.18);
(d) scope and content of the program to strengthen the Roads Directorate's
capacity for environmental impact assessment and monitoring (para. 2.19);
(e) size and content of the training program to be financed under the loan (para.
2.20);
(f) the Bank to be given an opportnity to comment on environmental assessment
studies for subprojects not fmanced by the Bank (para. 2.25);
(g) amounts to be allocated for maintenance in the years 1996 to 1998 (para.
2.27);
(h) use of Standard Bidding Documents for ICB for goods (para. 3.4)
(i) size, packaging and scheduling of civil works contracts (para. 3.7);
(3) modalities of disbursements applications (para. 3.11);
(k) special account arrangements (para. 3.12);
(1) auditing arrangements (para. 3.13); and
(m) efficiency indicators and monitoring targets (para. 3.14).
3.16       There are no conditions of effectivene  for the proposed loan.
3.17       Subject to the above, the proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$120
million with a term of 15 years, including a grace period of five years, at the standard variable
interest rate.

CHILE
ROAD SECTOR LOAN
Legal and Institutional Framework for Privatizatlon
in the Road Sector
Basic Objectives
1.        Tbe first objective Xt the Government has in granting road concessions to the
private sector is to secure new sources of financing for inhrastucture investment. If
concessionaires can finance their projects in the pnvate capital market and repay their investrs
without recourse to scarce tax resources, total investment in the highway sector can be ineased
without raising additional taxes or increasig public sector debt. A second and equally
important reason is that the private concessionaires are often better equipped than official
agencies to tap a new pool of talent to manage the construction, maintenance and operation of
infrastructure projects.
Legal Framework
2.        Road concessions must be carried out in Chile within the framework of the 1991
Public Works Concession Law (DFL MOP No. 164) which modified and replaced an ealier
body of laws that established private sector concessions for public works and govened the
process.' This legal framework is flexible, applicable to all types of works within the
jurisdiction of MOP,2 permits participation by every type of investor and presents clear ground
rules for the private sector.
3.        The 1991 law and associated regulations (Supreme Decree MOP No. 240) set forth
the general rules by which the construction, repair and maintenance of public assets are to be
undertaken under private concession. Decree No. 240 details the principles and norms for
operating the concession system with respect to the following aspects: (a) bids for con ting
concession projects odginated by MOP or private parties; (b) content of technical and financial
bids; (c) review, evaluation and selection of bids; (d) contracts and decree to formalize contra
award; (e) engineering designs and execution of works; (f) operation of assets; (g) sancdtns for
non-compliance with terms; (h) transfers and guarantees; and (i) suspension and cessation of,
or intervention in concession contact.
4.         The idea for the concession may onginate with MOP or with private contractors.
The law and the accompanying rgulary decree stipulate ta the state Odelegates" to pivate
parties the design, constuction, opeation and maintenance of the relevant infrstructure facilities
'Tb eadier concesso      include the 1960 Law 15,4  d DIL No. 206, the 1982 DFL MOP No. 1.

and the concessionaire takes on the responsibility for obtaining financing, contracing out works,
and subsequently managing the operaton of the facility and collecting fees from users. Such
user fees are to be subject to regulations laid down explicitly in the bid documents. Prospective
concessionaires need to meet minimum conditions with respect to their experience, financial
position, ability to contribute equity to the project and raise funds, and seriousness of intent.
5.        After two years of practical application, the legal framework for concessions was
slightly modified by law 19,252, dated October 15, 1994, which modified the evaluation criteria
for the award of concession contacts and introduced other minor changes.
[nstitutional Framework
6.        The authonty to set policies and develop road concession programs is vested in the
Ministry of Public Works Concession Council, created by Supreme Decree MOP No. 112 of
1992. The Council comprises the Minister of Public Works, Undersecretary of Public Works,
Director General of Public Works, Chief of the Office of Ministerial Advisors, Chief Financial
Officer, Director of Planning, and Chief of the Concession Division, who serves as the
Council's secretary. MOP's other units and the regional offices provide input in the formuation
of policies and programs through the Concession Division. Outside agencies that provide input
and support to the Concession Division include the President's Office, Ministry of Fiance,
Ministry of Planning, Ministry of Trnsport and Telecommunications and other institutions
involved in the operation of public buildings, public transport, ports, irrigation and airports. (see
Chart 1 of this Annex)
7.        The functions of the Concession Division of MOP, as defined by Supreme Decree
MOP No. 112, are to: (a) promote and coordinate the bidding of public works through the
concession system; (b) supervise and manage the concession prmcess in general, and the
awarding of contracts in particular; (c) establish and oversee uniform application of criteia and
conditions for concession; (d) review, analyze and recommend possible candidates for
concesson; and (e) oversee aU manner of activities, procedures or task assoiated with
concession within the junsdiction of the D iectrte General of Public Works. The work of the
Concession Division is supported by consultants from the University of Chile and other
individual consultants. An executive committee for concessios was established to coordinate
and supervise the activities of all the professionals involved (see Chart 2 of this Annex).
Concession Procedure
8.        Chart 3 below indicates the concession process based on Supreme Decree No. 240.
Regardless of whether the idea of the concession project originated with MOP or the pfivate
sector, the Director General of Public Works initiates the process by calling for bids. Pror to
this stage, the Ministry of Finance would have approved the feasibility study and the Presiden's
Office the concept and location of the project. Bidding documents for the project are published
with prior clearance by the Ministry of Finance and the Comptroler General's Office Whin
a pre-determined perod of time, potential andidates are allowed to seek claification from MOP



-400  
on the terms and conditions specified in the bidding document. The andidates then submit their
bids by a date specified in the bidding document. On a given day, at a specified time, in a pre-
determined place (all establifsed in the bidding document), the proposls are opened. The
proposals are then evaluated by an "evaluation commission' representing the Mnister, Director
General of Public Works and the Directorate of Roads, MOP. The evaluation takes into account
the terms of financial offers as well as the technical content of the designs proposed. The
commission awards the contact to the prospective concessionaire deemed to offer the best
proposal. Then a decree formalizing the contract award is issued.
tplementationl of the Concesion Program
9.        To assist in the implementation of the concession program, MOP with Bank
assistance obtained in March 1992 the Japanese Grant No. 21409-CH for Yen 98.4 milon to
finance studies required for the development of the system. Four studies by international and
local consultants have been completed covering such diverse aspects as: strategy, financing,
mnformation campaigns and evaluation criteria for concession schemes. Three further studies on
updating of the bidding documents, identification of candidate projects, and strategic analysis for
concessions along 1,500 kn of the Longitudinal Highway are in eaecution. Eight addidtoi t
studies are in preparation.
10.       MOP has carried out two feasibility and engineeing stes for specific concession
projects financed under the Secnnd Road Sector Project, Loan 3120-CH, and has carried out or
is implementng under own financing 16 analytical, feasibility on engineering studies. It has also
orawnized several local and intemational seminars and conferences to publicize its concession
program and has succeeded in generating substantial international intezest
11.       The first road concession project, "El Mel6n Tunnel", including a tunel of 1,200
meters length and access roads of 3.5 in, was awarded in June 1993 to a Chilean-Spanish joint
venture at a cost of US$25.0 million. Construction strted in October 1993 and is expcted to
be completed by February 1996.  A second concession project, -Southern Access to
Concepci6n", was awarded in July 1994 to a Chilean joint venure at a cost of US$21 million,
and construction has started. The bid for the concession project "Northern Access to
Concepcion" (US$80 million), was opened November 15, 1994 with the paricipation of four
Chilean joint ventures. Table B-1 provides an overview of the proposed program 1995-1998 for
the opening of bids for Public Works Concessions (MAP IBRD 26278).
12.       The project will support tis concession progam by financing technil assit
for quality control of feasibility and basc enginering stdies for projects idenified by MOP as
candidates for public works concessons, as well as consultant serices associated with the
ongoing review of the regulatory framework and the promoton of individual concession
schemes.

TDR ROAD SECTOR PROJECT
History of Bank Lending in the Road Subsector
1.          The Bank has provided assistance to Chile's roads subsector since 1961, through one
credit and seven loans totalling US$540 million (see Table C. 1). This long history can be
divided into two distinct phases. The first four lending operations (1961-79) were characterized
by implementation difficulties, slow execution of works and cost overms, while the last four
projects (1980-93) were implemented effectively at signifcantly lower cost and in a tmey
manner, fully meeting their objectives.

2.           The focus of Bank opeaons in Chile's roads sector has changed over the years.
The earliest projects emphasized basic construction and reconstruction of roads devasted by
natural disasters, as well as the introducdon of an effective maintenance program  (Higway
Maintenance Project, Loan  287, and  Highway  Construction  Project, Credit 4-H.   A
subsequent project developed the Bank's new focus on implementing sound maintenance
operations (Second Highway Maintenance Project, Loan 558-CH), while through the Second
Highway  Constructon Project, Loan 688-CH  road construction  and    onstructon efforts
continued. Despite these efforts, throughout the 1970s highway maintenance activities were



.46- 
seriously neglected by the Government, necessitating a major, if temporary, shift in project focus
toward highway reconstruction (First and Second Highway Reconstruction Projects, Loans 1927-
CH and 2297-CH), though the Bank's overall goal continued to be improved maintenance
operations. As reconstruction efforts progressed in the restoration of the basic network to an
acceptable level, in the nid-l980s the focus of Bank opeations began a return to the institutional
strengthening of MOP's Roads Directorate (Second Highway Reconstruction Project and First
and Second Road Sector Projects, Loans 2297-CH, 2589-CH, 3120-CH). In connection with
this goal, Bank operations have supported a shift in the execution of maintenance aivies fom
force account to private contracting, as well as the promotion of maintenance and road pavement
technology.
3.       In 1961, the Bank provided US$25 million to the roads subsector dtrough Lon  287-
CH for the Highway Maintenance Project and IDA Credit 4-CH for the BighM  Constmction
Prject. Together, these projects were to finance part of the cost of a road construction project
in the Southezn Zone of Chile, which had been devastated by earthquakes in May 1960, as well
as equipment and repair facilities for road maintenance operations in the entire country. The
scope of the projects was limited in part by the constraint of local funds availability and in part
by a host of implementation difficulties caused by the fact that the road sector represented a new
lending focus for the Bank in Chile. The Highway Maintenance Project was completed in 1966,
while the Highway Constructon Project Credit was not fully disbursed until 1971.
4.        Loan 558-CH, for the Scn=d Highway Maintenance ErdI, was approved in 1968
as a follow-up project for Loan 287-CH. US$13.2 million' was provided to support Chile's
1968-71 road maintenance program, with the goal of reducing the cost of road transport. Loan
components included continued supervision of construction wo:ks under the then ongoing Credit
4-CH, preparation of a new highway construction program, and provision of expert advice on
tansport policies and investment planning. The main accomplishment of this project was the
improvement of maintenance operations, including the acquisition of one fixed weigh staton and
eight portable weighing scales for the control of vehicle weight and dimensions. However,
project implementation was seriously hampered by a number of external fiscal and politicl
factors, including two changes of government in 1970 and 1973, each with a totally different
social philosophy; institutional roganon, including the creation of M1T in 1974;
government decrees reducing the size of the public sector, restricting the budget, and subdiding
the country into 13 administraive regions; and rampant inflation (which reached 520% by 1973).
Proect execution took mne years rather than the four esmated at appraisal.  The fina
disbursem. ent was made in 1978.
5.        Loan 688-CH for the Seod    ig   c    n  Eojt was approved in 1970.
It provided US$10.8 million for the construcion or  on   of 165 km of roads and
feasibility and engineerig studies for another 500 kin, with Xt  goal of reducing vehicle
operating costs. However, the disrpion stemming from drstic political and economic changes
'I M  loan agreement wa amended in 1974 to inlud n addiona US$1.6 mllion



* 47-.
contributed to large cost overruns. To prevent exceeding of the project budget set at appraisal,
modified project objectives were approved in 1974, including the construction or reconstruction
of 96 kin of roads, and feasibility and engineering studies for a bridge rehabilitation program.
The revised project was completed about four and a half years behind schedule (the final
disbursement was made in 1979); project works were of a satisfactory quality.
6.        Loan 1927-CH for the Highwy Reconstruton Erjct marked the start of a very
constructive period for the Bank's interventions in the road sector. The loan was approved in
1981, prov.ding US$42 million, mainly for the reconstruction of 250 klometers of Route Five.
Financing also supported technical assisnce for maintenance and training, preinvestment studies
for priority transport investments, and equipment purchases. The project &nieved its objectives,
substantially improving traffic conditions and contributing to economic development. The
Government's program for the control of vehicle weights, including the installation of eight
weigh-in-motion scales, increased fines for overweight vehicles, and stricter regulations for
freight-carrying vehicles, dramatically cut the incidence of overweight vehicles, from 25% to
1%; in addition, the inciden'^e of axle load limit violations was reduced from about 10% of all
trucks in 1982 to less than 0.5% after 1985.
7.        Loan 2297-CH for the Second Hihway Reconstructon .Eect, approved in 1983,
shared with the preceding Highway Reconstruction Project the sectoral objectives of assisting
the reorganization of the transport subsector begun by the Government in 1975, strengthening
MOP's physical and institutional capacity to upgade the national road system and improve
maintenance, and helping MT? to tackle overall sector and intermodal transport issues.
Specifically, the loan provided US$128 million to: (a) arrest serious deterioration of some
sections of the basic network; (b) implement a planning and management system for road and
bridge rehabilitation and maintenance; (c) assist in the preparation of a multi-year road program;
and (d) assist in the analysis of transport sector issues. Devaluation of the peso with respect to
the US dollar, efficient procurement, and keen competition in the construction industry resulted
in project costs lower than anticipated at appraisal, thus enabling expansion of project objectves
to include the execution of emergency repairs to roads, ports, and railways damaged by floods
and an earthquake in 1984 and 1985. However, despite efficient execution of civil works for
roads, expansion of the project and slow execution of emergency port works required extnsion
of the project's closing date from 1988 to 1990. The project fully achieved all objectives. The
Roads Directorate established a balanced, roLlng four-year road program which inreased
maintenance expenditures from 26% of total road expenditures in 1982-85 to 55% in 1986-89.
8.        Loan 2589-C  for the Eirst Road Sector Prasect was approved in 1985, and was
accompanied by a US$300 million private banks B-Loan, of which the Bank guaranteed the outer
US$150 million. The loan provided US$140 million to help finance MOP's three-year 1986-
1988 Road Investment and Maintenance Progm  (US$565 million), and to assist in the
execution of its road reconstrction and rehabilition program, and with the establishmet of

an effectively functioning road mainxance organiztion. The project put particular emphasis
on improvement of the Roads Directorate's competence in the planning and economic evaluation
of road maintenance and rehabilitation activities, improvement of maintenance execution
techniques, strengthening of the local road maintenance system, encouragng the pardcipation
of municipalities in the maintenance of local roads, and execution of a comprehensive training
program for the Roads Diretorate's staff. The Government realized shortly after negotiations
that budgetary constraints due to reconstruction needs after the March 1985 earthquake would
not provide sufficient countrpart funds for project execution within the initally projected three
years. It was therefore agreed to expand the project to a four-year progam with additional
physical targets. Ihe project was closed in June 1990, according to the revised schedule.
Project objectives were fully achieved. MTe Roads Directorate's maintenance capacity and
pavement management system were strengthened considerably. This project was innovatve for
Chile, not only because it supported the continued shift from force account to contract
maintenance, but particularly b%ause it fostered MOP's commitment to apply the Highway
Design and Maintenance (HDM) Model developed by the Bank for the planning of road
maintenance and rehabilitation.
9.        Loan 3120-CH for the Second Road Sector .wct was approved in 1989 for a totl
of US$224 million, and was complemented by a J-EXIM US$150 million loan to finance MOP's
1990-1993 Road Investment and Maintenance Program (US$907 million). In mid-1991, IDB
joined the parallel co-financing effort, approving a US$220 million loan. The main objective
of the project was to continue to improve the execution of MOP's road investment and
maintenance program, as wenl as to establish an effectively functioning road maintenance and
pavement management organizon. Specifically, the project was to help the Government: to)
continue to strengthen the Roads Directorate's capacity through a more focused taining
program; (b) complete the effort to reach normal maintenance levels through a balanced
distribution of funds between road investment and maintenance; (c) reestabLish a functional local
road maintenance system with improved technical executon; (d) further improve the Roads
Directorate's and ODEPLAN's competence in the economic evaluation of road construction and
maintenance acivities; (e) resolve major traffic congestion problems through a select progam
of doubled roadways; (f) rehabilitate the main road bridges of the country; and (g) mobilize
external resources for guaranteed project implementation.
10.      Implementation of the Second Road Sector Project (Loan 3120-CH was complted
satisfactorily according to schedule on December 31, 1993, achieving works execuion of about
20% above agreed trgets. However, the positive development of the Chilean economy and the
substantial expansion of forg  investment dunng project implementation resulted in an
unexpectedly strong flow of foreign currcy into the country, which motivated the Government
to take seveal measures to reduce foreign indebtedness and curtil intema inflaon.
Simultaneously, the Government successfully carried out a reform of the internal revenue sytem
which substnally increased the availability of local funding. In accordance with its policy of
urict control of Government expenditures, t  administrtion decided not to increas its
expenditures, but to replace foreign with local financing. The applicaton of this macroeconomic
plicy to the proect during the last two years of project mplentation resulted in an



-49- 
accumulation of an undisbursed loan balance of US$43.8 million, which was cancelled, at the
Government's request, on Ju.ue 22, 1994.
Lessons from Past Lending Operations
11.       Lessons learned from the 25-year history of Bank lending to Chile's road seow have
substantally evolved over the years. The PPARs for the Second Highway Maintenance Project
(Loan 558-CH) and for the Second Highway Construction Project ( Loan 688-CH) concluded
that implementation of these projects had been affected and delayed by the polidcal and
economic instability of the country in the early 1970s, lack of Govemment cotment,
inadequate financing (particularly for road maintenance), weak planning, and irsufficient
taining.
12.       By contrast, the recent consoldated Project Audit Report (PAR) on the H4ghway
Reconstruction Project (Loan 1927-CH), the Second Highway Reconstruction Project (Loan
2297-CH) and the Road Sector Project (Loan 2589-CH) concluded that the three projects fully
attained their objectives, that they belong to the very best series of road sector opations
analyzed in recent years, and that overal outcomes were highly saisfatory, institutional
development was substantial, and sustainability likely. It furth  states that the excellent project
results are attributable to several fictors:
(a)  strong and exemplary commitment by the Govemment, sector institutions, and
beneficiaries;
(b) coherent project design, based on relevancy and feasibility of project components;
(c)  effective Borrower-Bank relatonship and quality and continuity of Bank proect
staff; and
(d)  favorable macroeconoric conditions.
13.       An implementation completion report (ICR) on the second road sector project (Loan
3120-CR is in prepaion. However, it can already be stated that the excellent result of this
project are attibutable to the same fictors listed above.

THRD ROAD SECTOR PROJECT
Organization of the Road Maintece Progr
Background
1.       The planning and control of road maintenance has traditionally been the
responsibility of the Road Maintenance Department of MOP's Roads Directorate, which was
upgraded to Sub-Directorate level in the reorganization of December 1991 (Annex A, Charts 1
and 2). Road maintenance is executed by contract or force account through the Roads
Directorate's 13 regional offices (each region includes two to seven provinces). In the early
1980s, MOP's responsibility for road maintenance was limited to the basic network (about
23,300 Idlometers). As a result of a move toward decentalzation of administrative services,
the Government decided in 1976 to turn over responsibility for the primary and secondary local
road networks (about 56,000 ilometers) to the municipalities. However, the Roads Directoate
never completely relinquished responsibility for the local road network. Instead, it maintained
its local organizational stmcXture and retained some of its personnel.
2.        Under the First Road Sector Project, Loan 2589-C, the Roads Direcrateresumed
responsibility for the maintenance of the primary local network (24,500 kdlometers) and, in
collaboration with the municipalities, undertook spot interventions on the remaining, much less
trafficked 31,500 kilometers of the secondary local network, whenever taffic flows were
seriously impeded. Under the Second Road Sector Project, Loan 3120-CH, the Roads
Directorate substantially increased its maintenance efforts in the secondary local network, raising
average expenditures to about US$150 per kilometer, of which about 4% represented
contnbutions from some municipalities. The Roads Directrate was able to absorb this expanded
responsibility because: (a) maintenance expenditures had been rising since 1983 and are
expected to reach an average of US$3,000 per kilometer for the total network in 1994; (b) the
Roads Directore strengthened its maintenance organiion (paras. 3-8 below); (c) a high
percentage of the expanded works program was undertaken by contact (par. 6); and (d) the
Roads Directorate's staff and equipment fleet throughout the country is now sufficient for the
requirements of the expanded maintenance program (pam. 7).
MOP's Road Main            Organation
3.        Continuing the momentum developed under the two Highway Reconstdcon
Projects and the First Road Sector Project (Los  1927-CH, 2297-CH, and 2589-CR), the Roads
Directorate, under fte Second Road Sector Project (Loan 3120-CR, firther upgaded the
technical capacity of its maintnance staff and imprved maintenance adminis n
consideraoly. The Maintance Sub-D itorate, led by an experienced engine  with five
assistants and 19  ort staff, is organiWzed as folows:



-51 -                            Annex D
(a)   The Maintenance Deaent, headed by an experienced engineer with two
support staff, is responsible for countrywide planning, budgeting, and execution
of road maintenance operations. Its Mainteance Elanningub-    (four
professionals and two employees) is in charge of: (i) continuous upgrading of the
road condition inventory; (ii) medium- and long-term plaming through intensive
use of the HDM-I  model based on actual roughness and road condition
measurements in the field; and (iii) prioritizing and budgeting maintenance works
in close collaboration with the Regional Directorates, the Development Sub-
Directorate, and the Central Programming and Monitoring Unit.  The
Maintenance Execution Sub tment (four professionals and two employees)
is in charge of:  (i) setting up standards, specifications, and contracfing
procedures for maintenance execution; (ii) analyzing, discussing and approving
annual maintenance programs preared by the Regional Directorate; (iii)
allocating funds and resources to the regions; and (iv) monitoring the execution
of agreed programs and the quality of contracted works. The Force Account
Maintenance Sub-Department (four engineers and three employees) is in charge
of: (i) supervision and control of annual force account maintenance programs of
the regions; (ii) control of unit costs and the amount of monthly maintenance
operations by regions; and (iii) control of works compliance with technical and
administrative standards according to current methodology.
(b)   The Equipment Deartment, staffed by eight professionals and 62 support
personnel, is in charge of: (i) equipment administration; (ii) equipment and spare
parts procurement and distribution to the regions; (iii) equipment maintenance and
repair in the Roads Directorate's central workshop; and (iv) supervision of
equipment maintenance in the regions.
(c)   The Tolls Dtm=ent, staffed by 10 professionals and 351 support personnel, is
in charge of: (i) planning the toll collection system, including research of new
techniques and improvements of the information and accounting systems; (ii)
opang existng toll stations and safekeeping and submission of toll revenues;
and (iii) programming the maintenance of toll stations and equipment.
(d)   The Wighing DCpaitment, staffed by seven professionals and 103 support
personnel, is in charge of: (i) planning the vehicle weight control system using
stationary as well as mobile weighing scales, including research of new
techniques and development of an adequate infornation and monitoring system;
(ii) collaboration with the police and preparation of public information campaigns;
(iii) operation of existing stationary dynamic and static weighing scales and
preparation of weighing programs with mobile scales; and (iv) programming the
maintenance of weighing staions and equipment.



-52 -                             Annex D
(e) The Road Safety Department, staffed by five professionals and 41 support
personnel, is in charge of: (i) carrying out studies and preparing programs on
road safety in general in collaboration with traffic police and other institutions
involved in traffic safety; (ii) preparing specifications and regulations for
signalization hardware and its use, in accordance with national and international
norms and agreements; (iii) technical support for other Sub-Directorates and
Regional Directorates in the execution and maintenance of road signalization; and
(iv) preparation and monitoring of country-wide programs for road signalization
and other traffic safety works. This Department has been recently strengthened
in preparation for assuming new responsibilities under the road safety component
of the proposed project.
(f)   The Tunnels Maintenance Sub-Department, staffed by five professionals and nine
support personnel, is in charge of: (i) operation of existing road tunnels; (ii)
plaming, contracting and monitoring maintenance of tunnels and related
equipment; and (iii) participation in the preparation and evaluation of engineering
studies for tunnels and tunnel execution works.
4.        Each one of the Roads Directorate's 13 Regional Directorates comprises: (a) an
administrative department; (b) a planning and engineering department in charge of overall
maintenance planning within the region and carrying out the necessary engineering, either in-
house or by hiring consultants; (c) a force account maintenance departnent with equipment,
workshops and personnel to carry out routine maintenance; and (d) a civil works contracts
department in charge of contracting periodic and routine maintenance with the private sector and
supervising contracts execution. Each region is divided into three to five distncts, often
coinciding with the political division into provinces.
5.        The Roads Directrate's physical infrastructure (office buildings, warehouses, and
workshops), its maintenance personnel, and its equipment and vehicle fleet, which has been
streamlined and modemized under the two Road Sector Projects, are sufficient to cope with the
demands of the expanded mantenance program. Equipment availability and utilization have
increased substantially, reaching levels comparable to those in developed countries. The career
maintenance staff is very knowledgeable and effective; well-targeted training programs have
increased its technical capacity substantally. The Roads Directorate hires a great number of
consultants to perform engineering and supervision work. Since most of the increase in
maintenance works will be carried out by contract, only part  renewal of obsolete equipment
will be needed over the next four years.
Road Mntenane Operations
6.        The district offices within each region cary out the supervision of maintenance
conats as well as the execution of force account opertions in their respective areas. All



53-                               AnnexD
periodic maintenace is carried out by contract. About 50% of routine maintenmace is caid
out by contract and 50% by force account. Overall, 82% of total maintenance works are
executed by contract and 18 % by force account, compared to 65 % in 1980. Over this period,
the labor force involved in force account operations has diminished by about 50%, but
substantial productivity increases have kept force account output almost constant. Additional
cost savings in force account operations and the fivefold increase of total maintenance
expenditures in the same period have resulted in the progressive reduction of the percentage of
force account expenditures mentioned above. The unusually high effciency of road routine
maintenance by force account in Chile is demonstrated by the fact that the reliable cost
accounting system in effect since 1985 (pam 8 below) shows that unit costs for most routine
maintenance operations by force account are lower than the corresponding average unit prices
for the same operations performed by contract.
7.        Considering the high efficiency of its force account maintenance operations, the
Road Directorate wishes to keep them at their present level to enable quick response to
emergency situations, as well as to provide a check for contracting costs. However, its labor
force is progressively diminishing due to attrition and the lack of interest from young people to
enter this acdvity, given the better employment opportunities offered elsewhere by the Chilean
economy. The innovative procedures for contracting road maintenance being introduced by the
Roads Directore (Annex E) could contribute to further diminish its labor force or to redeploy
it to the maintenance of neglected secondary local roads.
Compliance with Targets and Development Objectives
8.        The organizational and operational approach described above has enabled the Roads
Drectoate to comply with all targets for routine and periodic maintenance. The Directorate is
continuously updating its road condition inventory, relying on modern equipment purchased
under past projects for deflection, slkd-resistance and roughness measurements.  It has
maintained reliable traffic counts and taffic classification studies for more than 30 years. It also
maintains satisfactory vehicle weight control on the main national roads, and is expanding its
weighing and control caacity to other heavily loaded roads in the main production areas. This,
coupled with an internationally recognized pavement research and monitoring system, provided
an excellent basis for the Pavement Management System established under the Second Road
Sector Project, Loan 3120-CH. The Roads Dirtorate already has established an effectve cost
accounting system for force account works, which takes into considert ion all cost factors,
including equipment ownership and overhead costs.  mhe training program, which includes well-
tgeted taning abroad, in-house training and training in other local organizations, has been
highly successful and has exceeded all agreed targets.
9.        The proposed project will assist in fiuther consolidation of the above-mentoned
achievements by providing technical assistnce and/or speialized key equipment and futer

. 55 -AnnexE
CHILE
THIRD ROAD SECTOR PROJECT
Program of Contract Maintenance by Area
1.   As stated in para. 6 of Annex D, all periodic maintenance and 50% of routine maintenance
is contracted out to private contactors. This, coupled with the fivefold increase in maintenance
expenditures between 1980 and 1993, has prompted a substantial increase in the number of unit
price road maintenance contracts awarded by the Roads Directorate. By December 31, 1993,
for instance, the Roads Directorate had 254 ongoing periodic maintenance contracts and about
200 routine maintenance contracts, for a total cost of about US$72 million. Contracting and
supervising so many contracts, in addition to more than 100 ongoing investment contracts,
substantially overburdens the Roads Directorate's contract management capacity.
2. In 1991, the Roads Directorate started to investigate the possibility of simplifying
maintenance contracting procedures with the following objectives in mind: (a) simplifying
contract administration; (b) strengthening privatization of road works execution; (c) allowing
pnvate contractors a longer time horizon to pla and finance their activities and to give them the
possibility of acquiring specialized equipment to improve productivity; (d) facilitaing the
involvement of local authorities in management and possibly co-financing, thereby expediting
the decentralization of maintenance responsibilities to local governments; and (e) encouraging
contractors' participation in bidding for maintenance works in remote areas.
3. 'Global" maintenance contracts were found to be the most adequate approach-contracts
covenng all road routne and periodic maintenance operations for an entire road network within
a specific area. This approach has been introduced on a limited scale in France and Spain within
the last 10 years, using unit price annual or multi-annual contracting by the road adminion
organizations of some of the 90 Departments in continental France and the Autonomous Regions
in Spain.
4.   The boldest and most comprehensive experiment in global maintenance contracting was
carried out 1988 in the Province of Bridsh Columbia in Canada, where the tsks of management
and operation of most maint ce activities within the 28 geographical areas of the province
were conted out under three-year, lump sum conats. About 75 bidders participated in the
tendering, 18 contracts were awarded to 10 private con tors and 10 contracts were awarded
to "employee groups' formed by former employees of the Highway Directorate, which in the
process cut its personnel from about 2,500 to 200. The contracts included: (a) provisi
regulating the transfer or rental of exisdng Highway Directorte equipment and physical
installations to the contactr; and (b) quality control regulations to ens  contra compliance
and to provide general oversight of the contractors' performance. This system proved hily
successfil, achieving an excellent level of maintenance of the total road network. In 1991, the
Highway Directate called for new bids to award the 28 global maintenance contracts for
another three-year period, with the possibility of extending them to five years. Contract
awarding was completed in January 1992 with substantial cost savings (compared to the odiginal



-56 -                             Annex E
cost estimates). This experience has shown clearly that the long-term responsibility for the
maintenance of an extensive road network can be transferred successfully and with cost savings
by the Government to the private sector.
5.   After studying these precedents, and given the generally poor condition of the roads of the
local network, MOP's Roads Directorate decided to follow a more cautious approach to global
road maintenance by contracting, on a unit cost basis, a one-year pilot project, and gaining
experience through close monitoring of this contract. This pilot project, covenng the basic
network and the primary local network of the Province of Talagante in the Metropolitan Region,
was awarded in April 1992 to the lowest evaluated bid among 12 submitted. The project,
costing about US$1 million, comprised the routine and periodic maintenance of 178 kilometers
of paved and 42 kilometers of gravel roads. It has been implemented successfully and has
allowed the Roads Directorate to gain substantial experience in this innovative contracting
procedure. The most important finding was that the introduction of global maintenance in Chile
requires first the preparation and implementation of a one-year contract to maintain and improve
the specific road network involved. Multi-annual contracts should only be awarded for such
improved networks. Based on this experience, the Roads Directorate is following the staged
procedure to implement, expand and refine global maintenance, described in paragraphs 6 to 8
below.
6.  Between April and September 1993, the Roads Directorate contracted five more annual
global maintenance projects in five provinces distributed between the Sixth and Tenth Regions
and a two-year contract in the Province Talagante By June 30, 1994, three of the one-year
contracts had been completed or were about to be completed. The Roads Directorate has started
the process of two-year conats for the same five areas mentioned above, and 13 new one-year
contracts throughout the country. (a IBRD 26278) The contracting of uglobalu maintenaee
schemes will be gradually expanded to reach 50 contracts in 1998, as shown in Table E-1 below.

7.   The gradual expansion of the global maintenance contracting system is not expected to
have substantial implications on the reduction of the Roads Directorate professiunal staff or its
labor force during implementation of the project. Its effect so far has been to ease the excessve
worldoad borne by the scant maintenance staff and to offer possibilities of upgrading and
strengthening superision. Force account labor idled by the introduction of global maintenance
contracts is being usefuUy redeployed in improving the maintenance of neglected secondary local
roads. During the gradual expansion of the global maintenance system under the proposed
project, the Roads Directorate will monitor the productive employment of its professional staff
and labor force, and take the actions required to correct any subsequent imbalances.
8.    Under the proposed project, the Roads Directorate will:
(a) continue implementation of the global maintenance contracts already initiated under
the Second Road Sector Project;
(b)  expand the program to other provinces;
(c) start preparing quality control regulations to ensure contract compliance and to
simplify supervision and payment procedures;
(d) based on accumulated experience, improve the bidding and contracting procedures;
and
(e) monitor the useful employment of idled staff and work force, and take required
actions.

THIRD ROAD SECTOR PROJECT
Road Tfraic Safety
Existing Traffic Safety Situation and Proposed Program
1.        Chile's rapid economic development, accompanied by steady growth in motorization,
has put a strain on the country's road infrtrucure, manifested in part by a marked deterioration
in road safety. As shown in Table F. 1 below, the rate of motorization has risen steadily since
the mid-1980s and the risk of road fatality has grown even more rapidly during this period.
Road traffic safety is fast becoming a major social concern in Chile. Presently, traffic accidents
constitute the third leading cause of death, after heart disease and cancer. Nationwide, in 1992,
Chile registered one road accident every 12 minutes, one senous road injury every 42 minutes,
and one road fatality every 5 hours. It is estimated that the cost (direct and indirect) of road
accidents in monetary terms amounted to US$150 million in 1992.

2.        Road accidents in Chile increasd from 35,279 in 1986 to 43,402 in 1992, at the rate
of 3.5% annually, and the incidence of road faalities increased from 1,191 to 1,700, growing
at around 6.1% per annum. An analysis of taffic accident data indicates some significant
trends. For a recent penod of five years, urban areas have accounted for close to 90% of all
road accdents (Table F.2). Santiago, Valparaso, Viiia del Mar and Concepci6n, the country's
four largest urban agglomerations, together accounted for some 65% of all accidents in 1990
(rable F.3). However, notwithstanding this significantly lower incidence of accidents, some
50% of all traffic fatlities occurred in rual areas Crable F.4), the bulk of them presumably on
the main trunk roads.

1985. The total number of vehicles involved in accidents increased from 52,237 in 1985 to
70,854 in 1992. However, not all types of vehicles "contributed" equally to accidents. It should
be noted that whereas the share of cars and that of bicycles and motorcycles has declined
significanty over this period, the share of trucks, buses and taxis has increased markedly. This
trend is consistent with the brisk pace of urban growth and the overall expansion of economic
activity that has resulted in the substantal growth of freight trafic over this period.

(including collisions involving two or more vehicles as well as vehicles hitting siationary

5.         Looking at the share of different categories of accidents by area of occurence
(Table F.7), one is struck by the predominance of the category 'passenger falling out' in the
Santiago metropolitan area and the frequency of 'cars overturning" in areas outside the
metropolitan area. The first category is undoubtedly caused by passengers hanging onto
crowded buses on city streets, and the overturning of cars is probably caused most frequently
by speeding, poor visibility and poor road designs on the national trunk roads. Pedestians
appear to be run over by vehicles with about equal frequency in city steets and on national
roads.

those involving a vehicle hitting a stationary object a  refered to as 'dwqua.

6.          Table F.8 divides the major causes of accidents into driver behavior, pedestrian
behavior, and road signs. Driver behavior includes speeding, pasing recldessly, not maintining
sufficient distance from the vehicle ahead, ignoring right of way, driving against the tfic  on
a one-way steet, and driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs. The pedestrian conduct
which leads to accidents includes pedestrians crossing highways with high-speed traffic in areas
not marked for pedestian crossings, and frequently ignoring traffic lights and pedesti
overpasses that are proded for the purpose.  Accidents are also caused by the lack of,
inadequate, or inap ia  sips and signals on streets and roads. The data here indicate that
while the share of accidents due to driver conduct has remained more or less the same, the



-63 -                              Annex F
influence of pedestrian behavior and the conditions of road signs have assumed increasing
importance as causes of accidents.
Road Traffic Safety Adminitation
7.        The authority for establishing overall road traffic safety policy, standards and
regulations is vested in the Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications (MIT). However,
the actual administration of road safety is spread over a number of central government agencies
and municipalities, and there is no formal mechanism for coordinating their activities. The
National Police (Carabineros de Chile) is responsible for the enforcement of laws and
regulations, and maintains a nationwide information system on traffic accidents. The Ministry
of Public Works (MOP) is responsible for ensuring that road designs and axle load regulatons
on the national network coirform to national road safety standards, and for installing various road
safety features, e.g., signs, barriers, and overheads. Likewise, the Ministry of Housing and
Urban Development (MINVU) is responsible for ensuring that the design of urban streets
conforms to road safety standards.
8.        The municipalities axe authorized to issue their own local traffic regulations either
alone or in coordination with contiguous jurisdictions. Responsibility for implementing vehicle
inspection and registration as well as driver testing and licensing is delegated to municipalities;
also, each local jurisdiction is authorized to set up its own system and rules within the limits of
national policy and norms prescribed by MIT. Traffic accident insurance coverage is
compulsory for all drivers in Chile. In addition to an operator's permit and vehicle registrtion,
every Chilean driver must obtain from the relevant local jurisdiction a circulation pernit which
he or she must carry at aU times along with an insurance policy. Local courts hear trffic
violation cases and impose penalties (e.g., revoking licenses, imposing fines, etc.).
9.        There are a number of private groups, e.g., Automobile Club of Chile, the Traffic
Safety Club, the Red Cross and insurance companies, which actively promote road traffic safety.
The National Safety Council, a non-profit private organization, was created by decree in 1952
with the objective of promoting safety in the workplace as wel as road safety through
publications, public education campaigns, workshops, and classes. With 40 major private
enterprises and government agencies represented on its board, the National Safety Council plays
an important role in coordinating the activities of different players. The National Traffic
Education Committee brings all these private institutions together under the leadership of the
police to promote specific actions in traffic safety education, such as preparation and printing
of educational materials, organization of traffic patrols in schools, drivers' education, and public
tffic safety education campaigns. There seems to be a certain degree of overlapping among
these private institutions.
10.       To provide the needed coordination to strengthen national road safety efforts, the
Government created, through Decree 223 dated December 27, 1993, the National Commission
on Traffic Safety, integrated by the Ministries of the Interior, Education, Justce, Public Works,
Health, Housing and Urban Development, Transort and Telecommunications, General

Secretariat of the Govemment and General Secretariat of the Presidency, and the General
Directorate of the Police. The Commission is presided over by the Minister of Transport and
Telecommunications and acts through its Executive Secretariat, which is headed by a tanwsport
engineer and has at present a staff of seven professionals from various disciplines. Mixed work
groups with professionals of other ministries are already tackling specdalized subjects such as:
transport of hazardous materials, rescue coordination, public spaces and roads, licensing, etc.
The Executive Secretariat is also in charge of the implementation of the road Safety Diagnosis
Study initiated under the Second Road Sector Project, Loan 3120-CH.
Leislation and Enforcement
11.       The traffic laws and regulations are embodied in the 1984 New Traffic Law2,
which consolidated and updated earlier legislation pertaining to road traffic safety. This law is
truly comprehensive, covering all aspects of road safety: safety features on streets and highways,
roadwortiiness of vehicles, competence of vehicle operators, and the conduct of driver,
passengers and pedestrians. The enforcement of the law by the National Police appears to be
both rigorous and even-handed.  Chile's traffic police enjoy a solid reputation for
professionalism and competence.
Road Safety Information and Campaigns
12.       The National Police maintain an information system on traffic accidents nationwide.
To enable the police to keep track of accidents throughout the country, it is mandatory to report
all accidents to the National Police; even where injuries are involved, the Police must be notified
first before the victims are taken to local hospitals or clinics. Their road safety information is
invariably up-to-date and its coverage appears saisfactory. Unfortunately, however, other
agencies involved in road safety admmistration do not have easy access to this valuable
information. These agencies would need to work in closer coordination with the police to have
this information processed in formats that can be more easily fed into their own systems.
13.       The National Police also carry out periodic public campaigns on traffic safety mles
(on topics such as the use of seatbelts, speed limits, and driving under the influence.) Traffic
safety is taught in the school system and the Ministry of Education is required by law to
incorporate appropriate matial on road safety into the primary education curriculum. The
National Traffic Education Committee, in coordination wit the Taffic Safety Club, the National
Safety Council, and various interested private groups, organizes workshops, puts out publications
and promotes public campaigns on road safety.
' The law fiu appeare in Dj o  kfldu (No.31.791) on Febuay 7, 1984.

Vehicle lnspection and Regsation
14.       Vehicles (titles and tags) are registered with the Civil Registry Service, which
maintains a computerized registry of motor vehicles. Municipalities are authorized to inspect
vehicles that are registered in their jurisdictions and to issue "circulation permits" for those
which meet the technical standards. These technical inspecdons cover, among other things,
alignment, steering, brakes, lights and fires and levels of emissions. The norms and procedures
for inspecdons are laid down by MIT.
Driver Testing and licensig
15.       The department of traffic and public transportaion in each municipality is authorized
by MTI to test and license drivers who reside in that particular jurisdiction. The criteria and
conditions for licensing drivers are, however, specified in great detail by class of vehicle in the
1984 New Traffic Law. In general terms, the driver, to be licensed, must be 21 years old, with
moral character and psychological and physical aptitude and proven sldlls to operate the
particular class of vehicle. The municipalities are also authorized by M1T to establish driving
schools and to determine the program, the method of training and the quaifications of
instructors, provided that these meet with the general norms of MIT as specified in the 1984
Traffic Law. MTr may at any time revoke the authority of municipalities to test and license
drivers or to establish driving schools if they do not conform to national standards.
A Program to Improve Road Safety
16.       The road safety program formulated by the Ministry of Public Works consists of six
components:
(a)  studies and civil works for reducing hazardous locations (black spots) on the
national network through provision of roadsigns, roadmarkings and lighting, and
construction of bikepaths, vehicular and pedestrian overpasses, sidewalks, service
roads, guard rails and barriers;
(b) studies, equipment and civil works to improve the maintenance of roadsigns and
roadmarkings;
(c)  establ       of close working relations between the Roads Directorate and the
National Police at headquarters, regional and pvcial level to strengthen
coordination on: (i) vehicle weighing and toll collection acdvities, (u) general taffic
control, (iii) joint monitoring of damages to the road infrastructure and taffic
control devices, and (iv) preparation of public education campaigs on road safety
and taffic regulation enforcement dnves, and monitoring of the results;
(d)  consultant services, equipment and training to consolidate the nation's road safety
information system managed by the National Police and the exchange of infomain

on road safety involving: (i) statistical information on traffic accidents to be supplied
by the National Police to the Roads Directorate, and (ii) information on traffic
volumes and composition, and on road conditions, to be supplied by the Roads
Direct.orate to the National Police.
(e) consultant services to carry out joint studies agreed between MOP and the Executive
Secretariat of the National Commission on Tiaffic Safety; and
(f)  technical assistance and training for MOP officials, including specific research
projects on road safety, overseas field visits, workshops and seminars.
Although the entire program will be coordinated by MOP, the National Police will participate
in the implementation of components (c) and (d) with project funds to be made available by
MOP.
17.       As part of this road safety program, MOP and the National Police will jointly
establish a high-level task force on road safety, which, in addition to these two entities, will also
include representatives from the Ministries of Transport, Housing and Urban Development,
Education, and Health to help lay the groundwork for better interagency coordination.

CHIL
TE3U ROAD SECTOR PROJECT
Environmental Impact Assessment and Monitoring
Background
1.        Basic inructions on prevention of environmental risks had for many years been
incorporated into MOP's guidelines and specfications. Consequently, road construction in Chile
has not caused major disptions of the environment in the past. However, a systematic
approach to environmental risk assessment and prevention was startd only in 1990, prompted
mainly by prqject eligibility criteria requested both by the Inter-American Development Bank
and the World Bank.
Leal and Organiation Framework
2.        The interminis  National Environmental Commission (Comisi6n Nacional del
Medio Ambiente, CONAMA) created by Supreme Decree No. 544 of March 20, 1992, is the
highest regulating authority on environment related mats. It is supported by an Executive
Secretariat which includes more than 30 interdisciplinary professionals and regulates and
monitors the environmental studies and actions of all other central and regional government
agencies and those of the private sector.
3.        The Ministry of Public Works (Ministerio de Obras Pdblicas, MOP) through its
Roads Diectorate (Vialidad) is in charge of planning constructing, maintaining and operating
all public roads in the country, except for urban streets. MOP's and Vialidad's responsibilities
regarding environmental aspects of their respective functions are regulated by: (a) the general
law on environmental mattes, Law 19300, -Bases del Medio Ambiente of March 9, 1994; (b)
the general law on public adminion; (c) the law on central and regional adminis n; and
(d) MOP's statutory law 15840 and Vialidad's organiztional decree DEL 206, both combined
under MOP decree 294 of 1984. A general regulation on environmental assessment is epected
to be completed by December 1994.
4.        MOP established in 1991 an Environmental Technical Unit (Unidad T&cnica del
Medio Ambiente, UTMA) under the Vice Mhiister's office. The main function of this unit is
to establish environmental norms and regulations for the sector, and to advise the minister and
vice miLsw on poicy and strategy. In addition, UTMA prepares studies, eitherw ith its own
staff (currendy five) or using consultants, about subjects related to environmental protecdon.
A computzed information system has been organized that provides information for each region
of the country regrding envirnmental risksl and mitigating measures for all public works and
for the entire road network. This system is being complemented with the preparation of regional
maps (scale 1 to 250,000) which identify road areas of environmental concern, such as
archeological sites and national parks. UTMA also prepawd Methodological Guidelines for the



-68 -                            Annc G
Environmental Evaluation of Public Works Projects, which were approved by MOP decree 951
of March 10, 1994.
5.        By decree D.V. 3034 of April 21, 1993, Vialidad gave legal existence to the
Environment Unit (Unidad del Medio Ambiente, UMA), which had been functioning unofficially
for two years and is attached to the Design Department of the Subdirectorate for Development.
UMA is headed by a civil engineer specialized in environmental assessment and presently has
a staff of three: one chemical engineer and two geography professionals.
6.        The general functions assigned tc UMA are:
(a) coordinate Vialidad's actions for environmental protections in all road works and
operations;
(b)  assist higher management in all environment-related matters and foster internal and
exteral coordination;
(c) contract and supervise environmental impact assessments (ELAs) and specific studies
for remedial actions;
(d)  develop methodologies and procedures for mitigation of environmental impacts; and
(e) monitor compliance with environmental guidelines and with the recommendations
of specific environmental studies during execution of works and their subsequent
operation.
Environmental Risks of Roads Projects in Chile
7.        The Chilean road network was fundamentally laid out in past decades and has grown
very little in the last 20 years, except for the Southern Road in the extreme south. As present,
most road civil works involve doubling existing two-lane roads to four lanes, paving of gravel
roads, construction of bypasses and overpasses, and general maintenance works. The
environmental risk of these works is small. However, some major road works in suburban areas
require special studies for the prevention of negative environmental impacts, such as acoustic
contamination and negative impact on land-use and population.
8.        The most important road environmental study was undertaken in 1991 and 1992 for
the paving of the existng gravel road Arica-Tambo Quemado, an intnadonal link to Bolivia,
the last 80 km of which cuts across the Lauca National Park (137,000 hectares) located in the
Chilean highlands, 4,200 meters above sea level.   This study produced concrete
recommendations for avoiding negative impact on the park's fragile fauna and flora, and on the
indigenous population. These recommendations were strictly complied with during construction
(financed under the Second Road Sector Project) and are being applied to regulate the operation
of the road. All potential risks were successfully avoided.



-69-Anx1
9.        The systematic assessment of environmental risks developed since 1991 by the UMA
is a blend of the IDB's and the Bank's environmental guidelines. The process starts with a
review of all road subprojects included in the next year's annual program, based on clearly
defined environmental cnteria. According to the result of this review, subprojects are classfied
as eite Class A, not requiring an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), but only
compliance with general environmental guidelines, and Class B, requiing ELAs, which are
ranked according to their environmental impact.
10.       An Environmental Data Sheet is prepared for each subproject needing an EIA to
define its raning, the level of studies needed (preliminary, medium or detailed) and the terms
of reference required. Based on this information, the UMA prepares the documentation for
contracting EIAs required and supervises their execution.
11.      The above procedures conform to well defined guidelines and criteria and are carried
out in a timely fashion. During the first semester of 1994, UMA reviewed the 76 road
subprojects to be initiated in 1995 (4 new construction, 7 widening, and 65 paving sub-projects)
and classified only 5 as Class B. By July 31, 1994, preliminary environmental stdies had been
carried out for 42 subprojects and terms of reference prepared for 16. The EIA's prepared by
UMA or its consultants recommend in each case the specific actions to be taken and define if
the supervision team for works implementaton should include an environmental speialit
12.       UMA also supervised the implementation of the study on Environmental
Strengthening, financed under Loan 3120-CH, the recommendations of wbich are being caried
out as outlined in paragraph 14 below.
Supervision of Environmental Impact during Execution of Works
13.       Since early 1993, UMA is also carrying out the supevision of the works execution
for the subprojects ranked as having higher environmental risk. This supervision is carried out
in close coordination with the superision teams of each particular project, and UMA's
recommendations are given in the field or presented in writing thrugh the chain of command.
In 1993, UMA supervised the execution of eight subprojects through 28 fieldtrips. Eleven
subprojects have been selected for supervision during 1994.
)'urther Strengthening of Environmental Assessment and Monioring Capacity
14.       The proposed project will enhance the coordination between UMA and UTMA under
the general oversight of CONAMA in accordance with the stipulations of Law 19300. It will
finance technical assistance and taining for furt  strengthening of the Road's Diectorat
environmental assessment and monitoring capacity through:

(a)  improving the guidelines and methodologies for claication and mitigation of
environmental impacts;
(b)  preparng an Environmental Data Bank to be linked to the existing Geographic
Information System;
(c)  sening UMA's actions in the supevision of worlcs execution and extending
them to road opadons and to the road conceson program;
(d)  establishing Task Agreements with other Directrates within MOP or outside
agecies to promote joint action, similar to the ageement already established with
the National Forest Corporation (CONAF);
(e) promoting general environmental awareness in the road sector; and
(f)  establishing a satsfactory taining program through local courses and visits abroad
to: (1) upgrade the capacity of UMA's staff; (ii) convey basic environmental
knowledge to higher level staff at headquarters and in the regions; and (iii) train
rgular supervisory staff to expand their knowledge of environmental assement and
impact mitigation.

T1DM ROAD SECTOR PROJECT
Training Component
Objectives
1.        The major objectives of the project's taining component are to:
(a)  assist in furiher moderization of Vialidad's management and administrative
procedures;
(b)  further strengthen the performance capabilities of Vialidad's staff;
(c) train staff in new technologies such as: quality control of maintenance worms,
preparation and supervision of concession projects, road safety and environmental
assessment; and
(d)  consolidate training efforts successfully camed out under the First and Second Road
Sector Projects (Loans 2589-CH and 3120-CH).
Description of the Training Program
2.        The training program will assist in the modernization of Vialidad's management and
administrative procedures by offering courses to higher-level staff on management techniques,
personnel management, cost accounting and control, and courses to high and mid-level staff on
the use and application of more sophisticated computer programs and familiariztion with
geographic information systems.
3.        Performance strengthening will be geared to managers and professionals (level A),
supervisors and administrative personnel, including secretaries (level B), and foremen and
helpers, including mechanics and equipment opators (level C). The program for managers and
professionals will emphasize stae-of-the-an techniques for (i) road and bridge design and
construction; (ii) maintenance contracting and supervision by quality standards; (iii) prepation,
contracting and supervision of concession projects; (lv) analysis of and approaches to road safety
problems; (v) design and execution of 'safe' roads and road featres and strures; and (vi)
assessment, evaluation and prevention or mitigation of environmental risks. The middle level
and administrative prgram will be diversified according to needs of particular groups and will
be quality and production oriented. The C-level courses will be of a more prcal nature and
will be geared to stengthening technical sdills, improving quality, and raising productivity.

Administration of the Training Program
4.        The Road Directate has a well established Training Unit consisting of three
professionals, two support staff and a variable number of instructors. These instructors for in-
house courses are regular Vialidad staff, who have been trained in the past as instructors and
have been reintegrated into the organization, but are available on call to act as instructors in their
speialized fields, receiving an additional remuneration for performing training activities. The
Training Unit has successfully carried out training programs for more than a decade. It
exceeded the targets set in both the First (1986-1989) and Second (1990-1993) Road Sector
Projects by more than 50% and it is independently cafrying out the 1994 training program. The
extraordinary success of these training programs has been one of the main causes of the well
documented progress achieved by MOP's Road Directorate.
5.        The Traning Unit is attached to Vialidad's Sub-Directorate for Adminisation and
Personnel, but is supervised technically by the Training Committee comprising all Sub-Directors
and a representative of the Regional Chiefs. A Regional Training Coordinator in each Region
assists in the selection of regional training candidates, in expediting their participation, and in
the organization of regional courses.
Implementation of the Training Program
6.        The training courses for the period 1995-1998 aim at improving therfoance
capability of about 3.600 people, representing 80% of the total Vialidad personnel. Because
some will participate in more than one course, the total number of participants will be 6400
(some 1600 per year, Table H-1). About 3000 will be tmined in courses organized by
Vialidad's own instructors and in its own facilities. About 3400 wiU be trained under
agreements with local institutions and universities. However, in aU cases, course content will
be defined by Vialidad's technical specialists under the supervision of the Training Unit.
7.        Table H-1 summarizes the 1995-1998 training program showing separatly the
number of courses offered to professionals, and to administave personnel and opeators, as
well as the number of participants and the respective costs. The costs for the in-house courses
include: (i) operational costs of the Training Units, (ii) transporation and per diem costs for the
participants, (iii) transportation, per diem and fees for the instructors, and (iv) training maters.
The costs for the extemal courses are separated into administrative costs, corresponding to (i)
and (ii) above, and the estimated cost for contracting the extemal courses, including the cost for
participation of some foreign experts. This information is provided separately for each year.
There will be a total of 615 courses, 6,400 participants and a cost of US$2.8 milLion. This
includes about US$45,000 for audio-visual equipment, and about US$55,000 for classom
equipment and furniture, for the 1995-1998 training program to be carried out in Chile.
8.        Following the positive expince of the three previous loans, selected personnel
staff will participate in training course and technical seminars abroad, to be trained in or obtain
information on state-of-teart technologies needed to furhr improve the road sytem of the

country and its management. Technical visits will also be carried out to other Latin Ameicn
countries to discuss issues related to intnational road linlcs and intermodal transportation, and
to exchange experiences on technical matus of common nterest. According to past exerne,
the cost for trasportation, per diem insurance, and registration fees amounts to about
US$500,000.

Economic Analysis
Geneal
1.        The main economic analysis of the 1995-1998 Road Maintenance Program was
carried out by the Ministry of Public Works using version m of the Bank's Highway Design and
Maintenance Standards Model (EDM-l)1 on the Chilean national road network of 75,588
kilometers,2 excluding 3,835 kilometers of Portland cement concrete (PCC) roads (Table 1.1).
The HDM-M model cannot be used for cement concrete roads because it does not have sub-
models to simulate rigid pavement deteroration. Accordingly, these roads were analyzed using
a separate model developed for the Ministry of Public Works by the University of Chile.
HDM HI Microcomputer Anaysis
2.        The HDM  model predicts the life-cycle costs of different road desip and
1'tenance options, including different time staging strategies for a specific road or alignment,
or for groups or UIinks' of roads.  It estimates costs for large numbers of alterave
maintenance policies on an annual basis, and can thus identify policies with the highest net
present value (NPV) at a given discount rate, or the highest internal economic rate of return
(IERR). The objective is to identify a combination of maintenance policies that exacts the lowest
life-cycle costs from society, including both road users and road authonties. The model
generates vehicle speeds and opeatng costs and road detenioraton and maintenance costs
according to a given set of road design and maintenance standards, traffic volume, axle loads,
and environmental conditions. The IRR of the 1995-98 maintenance program is estimated to be
above 55% and the NPV at US$1,904 million (see Table 1'.1.
3.        For the H1DM-i evaluation, the road network was disaggregated according to the
following characteistics:
(a)  ge    hic locagn (to capture climatic and soil effects), including four zones:
north, central, south, and extreme south;
(b)  su , including four ty: asphalt concrete, surface treatment, gravel, and earth;
(c)  Matf, including five levels: low, medium, high, extra high, and special; and
'Von Thrs for Pern Compute, HDM-I-PC, adjustd to Cilan condition.

and 34,234 klomeer of eah rads.

(d)  rad conditin, including ftree categories: good, fair, and poor. Table 1.2 and
Figure 4 show the breakdown of all road types according to their condition as of
July 1994.3
This disaggregation identified 120 homogenous groups of roads, or links, suitable for evaluation.
Table 1.3 shows the disaggregation of asphalt concrete roads into 34 links; similar disaggregation
yielded 23 links for surface-treated, 48 for gravel, arid 15 for earth roads. Table 1.4 shows the
distribution of paved and unpaved links in the Central Zone according to surface type and traffic
level.
4.        The data for this analysis come from actual measurements taken in the field. Since
the early 1960s, the Roads Directorate has been compiliiig and publishing statistics on traffic
density and classification for all roads every two years. The 1992 data were used for this
analysis. The 1992 classification of road conditions was based on an updated road inventory,
visual assessment, and (for pavements) a detailed evaluation using roughness meters, an optical
periilometer, and a deflectometer. Considerable effort was made to develop an information
system for pavement management, including the design of software to handle the data required
by the HDM model, such as: (a) geometry and history of the road; (b) surface type, base type,
pavement compositior. and strength; (c) incidence of pavement cracldng, rutting, raveling,
potholes and other blemishes; (d) degree of strrface roughness and pavement deflection; and (e)
shoulder and drainage conditions. Table 1.5 shows the average value of each road charactistc
for asphalt concrete links in the Central Zone. Surface condition for gravel roads was assessed
according to the remaining thickness of gravel, .maximum aggregate size, plasticity index and
roughness. lIowever, as the surface condition of unpaved roads vanes with traffic volume and
blading frequency, it was assessed according to the quality of road matials, mesured by
mechanical soil testing. Year-round trafficability was also used to classify road corwition for
both gravel and earth roads.
5.        Basic cost inputs were denved from experience gained under the First and Second
Road Sector Projects. For pavecu roads, this included unit costs for routine maintenance, pothole
patching, severa kdnds of surface dressings, overlays, and typical rehabilitation on asphalt
concrete or surface treatment (see Table 1.6). Similarly, for unpaved roads, unit costs for
routine maintenance, blading, spot regraveling, and full regraveling were derived from actua
past expenditure figures both by contract and by force account (see Table I.7).
6.        Policy optimization for a given set of conditions was carried out first at the link
level. In formulating maintenance policy alternatives for final evaluation, it was necessary to
test a wide range of maintenance options. Table 1.8 lists 16 maintenance policies retined for
paved links after elimination of more than 100 used in earlier runs. The base case consists of:
(a) basic routine maintenance; (b) patching when demand reaches 80 square meters per
kldometer; (c) rehabilitation at high levels of roughness (Intemational Roughness Index (IRI) of
3 See footnote a of Table .2 for an explanation of thd cteia used to define road conditions.

8 for roads with average daily traffic (ADT) less than 1,250 vehicles per day); and (d)
reconstruction at MI 7 for roads with ADT higher than 1,250. In addition, maintenance
operations on paved roads (in any condition) may include any combination of patching,
resealing, overlay, and pavemenit reconstruction. The base is compared with these other policy
combinations to evaluate the incremental benefits from increasing maintenance expenditures.
7.        Table I.9 shows 12 maintenance policies evaluated for gravel and earth roads. The
base case here includes: (a) nominal spot regraveling; (b) grading every 10,000 vehicle passes
and at least once a year; and (c) for roads having an ADT higher than 300, paving when ADT
reaches 900 vehicles per day or after the year 20O. The altemative maintenance policies
include: (a) spot regraveling and blading at various frequ ncies between 2,000 and 8,000 vehicle
passes; (b) spot regraveling and blading as in (a), but with regraveling of up to 15 cm of new
gravel when gravel thickness has worn down to a nominal 5 cm; and (c) for roads having an
ADT above 300, paving when ADT reaches 450 vehicles per day or before the year 2000,
whichever comes first.
8.       Traffic composition was divided into five vehicle categories ranging from light
vehicle to bus. Detiled information on fuel type, gross vehicle mass, payload, equivalent
number of axles per vehicle, normal vehicle service life, hours and kilometers driven per year,
and average number of passengers per vehicle was gathered for each category. Finally, unit
costs of vehicle ownership, maintenance, and operation were calculated in terms of financial and
economic costs (see Table 1.10).
9.        Traffic volumes and classification were obtained from routine observation at toll
stations and from biannual counts (see Table 1.1). Annual traffic growth rates were projected
for each zone, each surface type, and each vehicle type, varying from 7% to 8% for light
vehicles, from 5% to 7.5% for buses, from 4% to 6.5% for light trucks, and from 4.5% to 6%
for heavy trucks.
10.      All relevant maintenance policies were tested on all links and evaluated over a 15
year period, from 1994 to 2008, to obtain (a) the NPV of each altenative when compared with
the base case at a discount rate of 12%, and (b) the IERR. With no budgetary constraints, the
optimum policy for each link is that which maximizes the NPV.
Results of the Econcomic Analysis
11.      The results of the HDM analysis are summarized in Table 1.1. For each surface
type, length, expenditures for the 1995-1998 period, and the NPV and IERR computed over a
15-year period are shown. Part A of the table shows the combination of technically
recommendable maintenance operations yielding the highest NPV. The 1995-1998 expenditures
required for this combination, totalling US$1,175.7 million, exceed the amount considered in
MOP's budgetary projecdons. Therefore, to reduce expenditures, lower maintenance policies
for gravel and earth roads, which account for 71% of the total network but carry only 27% of
total traffic, were selected (see Part B of Table 1. 1). The IERR is 51% for asphalt concrete,



-78-
60% for surface treated, and more than 55% for gravel and earth roads. An IERR of 54% for
Portand cement concrete roads was obtained independently. The combined IERR of the total
maintenanceprogram is above 55%. With total expenditues of US$890.1 million over the four-
year period, the NPV computed over a period of 15 years is US$1,904 million. The HDM
analysis also identified the need to upgrade 2,565 ldlometers of gravel roads to paved standards
over the four-year period, requiring an expenditure of US$378 million and yielding an NPV of
US$680 miL1ion and an IERR over 55%. However, as this upgrading component is regarded
as an investment operation, it has been included in the investment component financed entirely
by the borrower.
12.      The HDM analysis predicts the annual quantity of works required for different
maintenance operations and their corresponding expenditures. Table 1. 12 shows this information
for asphalt concrete roads. The analysis can be used to establish relative priority among all
maintenance operations within each region as well as nationally. Table 1.13 shows the national
and regional priontization of individual maintenance projects for asphalt cement and surface
treated roads in the Fourth Region. The table also shows, for each project, the NPV, IRR,
annual capital expenditures, recurrent expenditures, total expenditures over the four-year period,
and accumulated length of works, NPV, and expenditures witiin the regin over the four-year
period. For planning purposes, this information (and even more deailed information such as
the foreign exchange component or a breakdown of current costs into labor, materials,
equipment and overhead) can be ordered in any way to facilitate national and regional planning,
allocation of funds, and many other praccal tasks.

Efficiency Indicators and Monitoring Targets
A. Administration Efficiency Indicator
By June 30 each year starting in i995, the Road Directorate would submit to
the Bank a complete statistical analysis documenting that during the previous year
the following efficiency Indicators were maintained below their respectively indicated
cei!;ngs:    (I)  Administration expenditures as percentages of total expenditures        9%
(ii) Supervision costs as percentage of respective civil works costs        8%
(iii} Average percentage of physical contingencies in civil works contracts  8%
(iv) Average percentage of ohysical contingencies in consulting
contracts                                                                   8A6
(v} Calendar days elapsed between opening of bid and
contract award:    for civil works contracts                            28 days
for consulting contracts                              30 days
B. Maintenance Efficiency Indicators
Not lasr than August 15 each year, starting In 1995, the Road Directorate would submit
to the Bank a statistical analysis documenting compliance with the following tasks and
indicators during the previous year:
(i} Road Maintenance Expenditures, (including Maintenance Administratior.
Expenditures), as a percentage of total Road Expenditures to be higher than  56%
Oii) Estimate of real unit costs of all routine and periodic maintenance
operations performed by force account, disaggregated Into labor, equipment,
fuel, rnaterials and overhead costs, established in accordance with the
cost accounting system already in use under the First and Second Road
Sector Projects
(iii) Analysis and justification of annual Increases experienced by the
above unit costs
(iv) Force account maintenance expenditures as percentage of total
maintenance expenditures to be each year less than                         18%
Iv) Disaggregation of maintenance expenditures among the Basic Network,
