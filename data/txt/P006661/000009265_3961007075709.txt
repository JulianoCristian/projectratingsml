MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHILE
FOR A THIRD ROAD SECTOR PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following  memorandum  and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of Chile for the equivalent
of US$120 million to help finance a project for road sector improvements. The
loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate with a mawity of 15
years, including five years of grace.
2.    Coy Sector Background.   The structrl transformation of the
Chilean economy has been nearly two decades in the making. Since the mid-
1980s, the macroeconomic program has brought the country to levels of growth
and price stability unprecedented in its history. During 1990-93, Chile was one
of the most successful Latin American countres in achieving notable economic
reforms and gains. GDP growth averaged 6.4 percent yearly; inflation fell to
an annual rate of 12.2 percent; and unemployment declined to 4.5 percent in
December 1993 (an 18 years low). Public sector finances continued to register
surpluses while the current account deficit averaged only 2.1 percent of GDP.
3.    Notwithstandig these achievements, Chile remains susceptible to
significant constraints. One is that Chile's capital stock is inadequate in
important respects to sustain its past growth. A decade of underinvestment in
infrastructure and neglected maintenance in the 1970s left a legacy of burdened
and inadequate transport facilities, particularly in the road system. The
deterioration process was partially turned around in the mid-1980s, but not to
a degree sufficient to satif the needs of the rapidly developing economy.
There are severe road capacity and quality constraints. Moreover, traffic
accidents are now the third leading cause of death. A recent study estimated
that in 1991-92 these problems cost the economy as much as US$375 million
annually in additional ope;ating expenses. Product losses and impaired
accessibility and safety have been harmful too. Considering that roads carry
about two-thirds of total domestic freight, this base will have to be significandy
strengthened for Chile to maintain its export competitiveness. Large stretches
of the national network need major improvements while many main tmruk and
lateral roads will need to be upgraded to expressway standards.
4.    Public infrastrcture investment over most of the past 25 years has
stagnated at a low 1.0-1.5 percent of GDP. To remedy this, the Government
stressed transport and sewerage facilities and increased capital expenditures for
this purpose between 1990 and 1993. Public investment in the road sector



during that period exceeded 47 percent of total capital spending for
infrastructure. An encouraging trend has been the increased share of spending
on maintenance, which more than doubled from 27.2 percent of total road
expenditures in 1985 to 61.3 percent in 1991. This policy, supported by the
Bank's First and Second Road Sector Projects (Loans 2589-CH and 3120-CH),
has brought about notable improvements in road conditions.
5.    Still, the long-term capita: requirements for reversing the extensive
deterioration of roads and for meeting expected future demands of the growing
economy are expected to be substantial. The Ministry of Public Works (MOP)
has estimated that annual funding would need to average US$500 million (1992
prices) over the next four years to meet improvement and upgrading
requirements together with maintenance needs. There also are requirements for
streng,hening safety precautions and envirormental aspects.  Meeting these,
incidentally will necessitate remedying institutional fragmentation in the sector
as well.
6.    Significantly, since the late 1970s, the transport sector has undergone
considerable restructuring in line with Chile's strongly market-oriented
economic policies. Key changes have included the elimination of subsidies,
liberalization of private sector access to the road transport industry, and
encouragement of private sector participation in investment and operations.
Operational efficiency has increased significantly through this process. Further,
although the road network is publicly owned and operated, the Government has
been tirning increasingly to the private sector for assistance. MOP enters into
civil works contracts with private firms, which now undertake virually all new
works and 90 percent of maintenance. The Ministry's use of force account for
maintenance works fell from 65 percent in 1980 to 10 percent in 1993.
7.   In further support of these trends, the Government promulgated a law in
1991 that facilitates new public/private partnerships.  Subsequently, the
authorides have begun concessioning roads. In addition, they have been
exploring private highway concessions for mobilizing domestic and foreign
investors as possible new sources of investment finance under BOT ("build,
operate, transfer") schemes. Two such concession arrangements already are in
execution. The Government effectively used Bank assistance to strengthen
Chile's legal, financial, and institutional framework for road concessions.
8.    MOP is also experimenting with the use of global maintenance contracts,
whereby private firms undertake maintenance works for entire road networks
throughout provinces or smaller geographic areas. This simplified approach,
successfully piloted in Canada and Western Europe, consolidates a series of
works, and thus reduces management and supervision costs. It also can increase
the efficiency of private contractors by affording them greater time and
geographical horizons for planning and financing activities and for the use of
specialized equipment. This type of contract can also facilitate the imvolvement



- 3 -
of local authorities to further advance Chile's decentralization of various public
services. A contract for a pilot project in Chile was awarded in mid-1992 and
has provided useful experience for MOP. Five more global maintenanice
projects have since been launched, and 13 others are in the bidding and contract
awarding process.
9.    Project Objectives.   The proposed project has been designed to
consolidate MOP's commendable progress in road maintenance administration
while introducing additional policy and institutional objectives. The objectives
of the proposed project are: (a) to consolidate the road uiaintenance and,
pavement management program financed under the First and Second Road
Sector Projects; (b) to support the Government's privatization efforts in the road
subsector through (i) the use of "global" maintance contracts, and
(ii) promotion of BOT schemes for private sector financing of road and road-
related investments; (c) to improve road traffic safety on the national network;
and (d) to strengthen MOP's environmental impact assessment and monitoring
capacity in the road subsector. These objectives are intended to support the
government's aims of achieving greater international competitiveness and
environmental protection.
10.  Project Descrintion.  The proposed project will assist MOP in the
implementation of its proposed 1995-1998 Road Investment and Maienance
Program which amounts to US$1.94 billion. The proposed loan of US$120
million will finance only key innovative sub components of the program that
involve the application of state-of-the art techniques, specialized eqwpment or
advanced know-how, closely associated with the policy and institutional
objectives sp cified above. The project components are:
(a)   Road Investment (40.6 percent of total project cost) includes:
(i) road widening, road upgrading, construction of bypasses and
overpasses, to be financed exclusively by the Government; and
(ii) constuction of road safety infrastrucure as well as consulting
services for quality control of feasibility and enring studies
for concession projects, review of the regulatory framework, and
promotion of concession schemes, to be financed under the
proposed loan;
(b)   Road Maintenance (52.5 percent of total project cost) includes
periodic and routine maintenance works, equipment acquisition,
special maintenance operations (tunnels, weighing and toll
systems, bridges, riverbank defenses, and road signs), consulting
and training. The proposed loan will finance only the following
subcomponents: (i) civil works "global contracts" for execution
of periodic and routine maintenance; (ii) procurement of state-of-



-4-
the-art equipment for selected maintenance operations, for
upgradmg tumnel ventilation and traffic control equipment, and
for replacement of obsolete weighing and toll station equipment;
(iii) provision and maintenance of road signs and markings, and
of road safety equipment; (iv) consulting services for further
improving road maintenance administration, for improvement of
road safety, and for strengthening MOP's institutional capacity
to carry out environmental assessment and monitoring; and (v) a
program for technical and study visits abroad; and
(c)   Administration (6.9 percent), of which 2.8 percent corresponds
to investment and 4.1 percent to maintenance, to be financed by
the Government.
11.   Total project costs are estimated at US$2,075 million, with a foreign
exchange component of US$1,029 million (50 percent).  No physical
contingencies are provided because of the sectoral nature of the project. If any
arise, these would be met by program work reductions. Price contingencies are
calculated, based on international inflation, at US$136 million (7 percent of total
costs). (Schedule A) The proposed loan of US$120 million equivalent will
finance approximately 6 percent of total project costs and 12 percent of foreign
costs. The Government will finance the remaining foreign exchange and all local
costs, including some US$330 million in identifiable duties and taxes.
Procurement and disbursement arrangements are shown in Schedule B.
12. Project Implementation The Borrower will be the Republic of Chile
with MOP's Roads Directorate responsible for project execution. Its Works
Subdirectorate will execute road safety infrastructure works. The Maintenance
Subdirectorate will oversee the mainta  subcomponent (including road
safety).  The enviromnental subcomponent will be administered by the
Environmental Unit within the Development Subdirectorate. MOP's newly-
created Concession Department will administer the road concession component
in close coordination with the Roads Directorate. The Roads Directorate
Training Unit will implement all training under the project. Following
successful practices under past Bank-assisted projects, the Roads Directorate's
Foreign Loans Department will serve as the overall project coordinator. During
negotiations, agreement were reached on arrangements with the National
Commission on Road Safety and the National Police for implementation of the
road safety program. Agreement was also reached on the arrangements to
strengthen the Roads Directorate's capabilities for enviromnental impact
assessment and monitoring.



13.   Proiect Sustainabiity.  The project design will reinforce MOP's
established capability in project administation, while upgrading its experience
in contract administration and environmental protection. This is supplemented
by the indications of continuity in policy direction and the central economic
team's demonstrated support of MOP's program.   Moreover, MOP's
commitment to sound road maintenance policies and practices, manifest under
earlier Bank-financed projects, is expected to remain firm.
14.   Lessons Learned. The project design also reflects the lessons of previous
Bank road actvities in Chile, especially the importance of: (a) long-term
Government commitment and interministerial cooperation; (b) sound
management of the implementing o niation; (c) a strong sectoral framework;
(d) active participatory elements in project preparation; (e) flexibility of proikt
design; and (f) follow-up activities on such long-term objectives as improved
maintenance and institutional strengthening.
15.   Rationale for Bank Involvement Support of the government's goal of
achieving improved international competitiveness is a central theme of the
Bank's proposed country assistance strategy. At the request of the newly elected
authorities, a CAS outlining this strategy, is expected to be considered by the
Board in the spring of 1995. The present strategy underscores the importance
of overcoming the inadequacies of the country's infras,tuctr, which is one of
the main growth constraints. Chile's land transport warrants special attention
since it is relatively undeveloped compared to other countries at similar incomie
levels. The proposed intervention in the transport sector is therefore fully
consistent with the proposed country strategy. Moreover, the Bank is well
placed to complement the Government's efforts to mobilize private financing for
road building and operations, and to upgrade the quality of the Government's
enviromnental protection activities.
16. Agreed Actions. During negotiations, agreement was reached on the
following: (i) the detailed 1995 road maintenance program; (ii) the scope and
content of the road safety program; (iii) studies to be financed for the
concession program; (iv) the scope and content of the program to strengthen the
Roads Directorate's capacity for environmental assessment and monitoring;
(v) size and content of the project-wide training program; (vi) the Bank to be
given an opportunty to comment on environmental assessment studies for
subprojects not financed by the Bank; (vii) budgetary allocations for
maintenance for the years 1996-1998; (viii) bidding documents for ICB for
goods; (ix) modalities of disbursement; (x) special account, auditing, and
reporting arrangements; and (xi) efficiency indicators and monitoring targets.
17. Poverty Category. The operation is not a poverty focused loan.



-6 -
18. Enviromnental Aspects. The Road Directorate's capacity for assessment
and prevention of environmental risks will be strengthened. The natu  of most
civil works involved in the project is such that no major environmental effects
are foreseen.Environmental impact studies will be carried out for individual
subprojects presenting higher environmental risks. The proposed project,
accordingly, has been assigned a B classification.
19.   Progrm Objectives Category. The project will support Government
efforts to strengthen the management of the important basic infrastucture
constituted by the road network.  It will also support private sector
development through "global" road maintenance contracts and BOT schemes.
20. Participating Approach. Representatives of road user groups and other
non-governmental organizations have participated extensively with MOP and the
policy department in the development of various components of the project, in
particular, the safety program. They will continue to be involved actively in the
implementation of the traffic safety awareness and education program.
21. Project Benefits. The economic analysis of the road maintenance
component (over 56 percent of base costs), using the Bank's Highway Design
and Maintenance Standards Model (HDM III), forecasts an internal rate of
return (for the entire 1995-1998 program) of 50 percent. In addition, the main
benefit of the proposed project would be prospective road system efficiency
gains through increased private sector participation under the "global" contracts
and "BOT" concession schemes. The project will also strengthen MOP in areas
that would assume increasing importance with greater private sector
participation-road safety and ensuring environmentally benign designs in
combination with impact assessments and monitoring. Fewer deaths and injuries
from traffic accidents should also be among expected project benefits.
22.   Risks. The main project risks are the uncertainties related to the road
safety component, an area where institutional responsibilities are fragmented and
coordination is not easy. It should be possible, however, to minimize these
risks by the project's phased approach to the development of a national safety
program. Second, while the "BOT" scheme entails . relatively new concept in
Chile, there is an adequate legal, financial, and institutional framework in place
to support it. This should mimize any potential difficulties arising from the
introduction of this approach. For other parts of the project, MOP Roads
Directorate has a proven record of successful project implementation. Its staff
continity and effective contracting procedures augur well for successful project
execution.

23.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the i, .oposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and I recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
