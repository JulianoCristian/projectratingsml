and create a new one.  To this\n            end, the project will include:  (a) replacement of deep\n            wells and provision of pumping equipment, and construction\n            of piped water distribution systems.  It will also provide\n            for; (b) orchard and crop reconversion and intensification;\n            and (c) provision of equipment and staff to the executing\n            agency, the Gabes and Medenine Irrigation Development Office\n            (OMVGM).  Finally, the project will involve; (d) provision\n            of technical assistance to OMVGM and to existing farmer\n            associations; as well as (e) provision of credit to farmers\n            for onfarm development.  The project will directly benefit\n            about 7700 farm families, among the poorest in Tunisia.  The\n            risk related to slow adoption by farmers of new cropping\n            patterns is minimized by the provision of suitable extension services."}, "docdt": "1985-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
