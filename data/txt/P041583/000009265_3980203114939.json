"This is the Implementation Completion\n            Report (ICR) for the Employment Generation Project in Haiti.\n            The objectives of the project were to: (a) create short-term\n            employment for people in extreme poverty in support of the\n            Borrower's program for poverty alleviation; (b)\n            rehabilitate seriously deteriorated economic and productive\n            infrastructure in the Borrower's country; and (c)\n            strengthen the capacity of non-government and community\n            organizations operating in the territory of the Borrower to\n            manage labor intensive small-scale development projects,\n            including the establishment of a national non-government\n            contract management entity; (d) development of a longer term\n            strategy for poverty alleviation, employment and small\n            infrastructure maintenance. Bank performance is rated highly\n            satisfactory. The Borrower's performance is rated\n            satisfactory. The key lessons learned were: (i) a\n            partnership between public and private and non-governmental\n            sectors can live up to tremendous challenges; (ii) not all\n            infrastructure rehabilitation sub-projects are suited for\n            labor-intensive methods; (iii) extensive participation with\n            beneficiaries and local authorities are necessary from the\n            inception of sub-projects to ensure sustainable maintenance\n            and operation; (iv) the Bank and the government are able to\n            move very fast when supported by senior officials; and (v)\n            more realism is needed about what can be achieved in terms\n            of institutional development in a short time period and in\n            an environment such as the one prevailing in Haiti in 1995-1996."}, "docdt": "1997-12-18T00:00:00Z"}
