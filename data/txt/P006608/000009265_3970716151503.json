        reviewing structural factors of the high cost of mortgage\n            finance and assessing and implementing alternative sector\n            policies.  Another objective is:  (ii) to generate\n            employment in housing construction and help reactivate the\n            economy.  The project supports MINVU's ongoing housing\n            programs.  It consists of: (i) a package of policy\n            improvements; (ii) the construction of about 68,000 houses\n            under the Social Housing Program (SHP); and (iii) the\n            provision of about 47,000 houses under the Allocated Subsidy\n            Program (ASP).  The project further includes:  (iv) studies\n            and other technical assistance to address key sector issues."}, "docdt": "1984-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
