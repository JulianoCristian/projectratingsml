CHIL2
PUBLIC SECTOR HOUSING PROJECT
I.  LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:          The Republic of Chile.
Amount:            US$80.0 million equivalent, including a capitalized
front-end fee.
Terms:             Repayment in 15 years, including 3 years of grace, at the
standard variable interest rate.
Project            (i) To support the Government's effort to address sector
Objectives         issues suon as reducing and ultimately eliminating
subsidies, increasing cost recovery, improving targeting,
reviewing structural factors of the high cost of mortgage
finance and assessing and implementing alternative sector
policies; and (ii) to generate employment in housing
construction and help reactivate the economy.
Project       -.
Description:       The project supports MINVU's ongoing housing programs and
consists of (i) a package of policy improvements; (ii) the
construction of about 68,000 houses under the Social
Housing Program (SHP); (iii) the provision of about 47,000
houses under the Allocated Subsidy Program (ASP); and (iv)
studies and other technical assistance to address key
sector issues.
Benefits:          The project would induce significant public sector savings
through policy improvements and would benefit households
below the country's urban poverty threshold.
Additionally, it would contribute substantially to timely
economic reactivation by providing about 40,000 gross
job-years during 198J;-1987.
Special Risks:     Risk of possible decrease in use of ASP subsidies by
beneficiaries of ASP because of possible worsened economic
conditions would be offset by reallocating resources to
the SHP where construction is controlled by XINVU. Risk
of non-compliance on further policy improvements would be
mitigated by a continued Bank presence in the sector.

II. THE HOUSING SECTOR
A. Main Characteristics
2.01      During the past 30 years, Chilean Governments have experimented
with a wide variety of housing policies and programs. While many experienced
housing institutions have emerged in both the public and private sectors
(Annex 1), the Ministry of Housing and Urbanism (MINVU) is now the dominant
sector authority responsible for setting sector policies and programs. It is
generally well managed (Annex 2).
2.02      In 1977/78 the Government, in line with its economic philosophy,
substantially altered housing policies; it reduced the direct involvement of
the public sector in providing low-income housing and shifted to the private
sector much of the initiative as well as administrative responsibility
associated with housing construction.
2.03      The new system involves public expenditures in the form of large
upfront subsidies, but allocates most of the responsibility for arranging
construction and financing to the private sector. The level of upfront
subsidies was established to compensate for high real mortgage interest
rates.
B. The Housing Market
2.04      Demand:  Various studies have estimated the current housing
"deficit to be as high as some 750,000 units, with annual increments in
housing "needs of 60,000 to 90,000 units. This concept of "deficit",
however, is founded on the principle of universal access to adequate housing
as defined by the Chilean Housing Authorities; it is not a measure of market
demand. The deficit in terms of minimal facilities including squatter
settlements, shared passageways, etc., is probably around 200,000 units.
2.05      In the absence of subsidies, relative price, the level of long-run
expected real income and the cost of credit have tended to contain the demand
for housing by low-income groups in Chile. With the introduction of NINVU's
subsidy programs, the demand for housing among these income groups became
manifest. At the planned level of subsidies, 20,000 to 25,000 houses per
year programmed under the Social Housing Program (SHP) and 17,000 to 20,000
subsidy certificates per year programmed under the Allocated Subsidy Program
(ASP) for the next three years would easily find qualifying beneficiaries.
2.06      Supply:  The total stock of housing is currently 2.5 million of
which about 600,000 units or 24 percent have been provided by the public
sector. Thus, about 76 percent of families rely on the private sector,
without subsidy, for their shelter. New private and public housing reached
55,000 units (about 2 percent of the total stock) in 1981, then declined to
27,000 units in 1982. Since 1978 the public sector sponsored 20,000 to
28,000 fully built units per year. The private sector increased its
production mainly, for middle and upper income groups, from about 1,000 units
in 1978 to an all-time high of 27,000 units in 1981, then declined to 7,000
units in 1982. In 1983, private sector housing construction fell sharply. To



-4-
compensate for the dwindling importance of private sector initiative, the
public sector began to step up its expenditures in 1983/1984 (Annex 3).
2.07      The housing .~7ental market was deregulated in 1982; rent controls do
not exist and tenants receive no special protection. Rental markets are
important in low-income areas, but little is known about the contractual
arrangements and the level of rents. A review of all aspects of the rental
market including the incentives required to foster more rental solutions
would be carried out under the proJect.
C. Housing in the Current Economy
2.08      The construction sector has played a key role in Chile's economic
growth. During 1977-1981, the sector's share of GDP averaged five percent
and its rate of growth -- 20 percent per year -- was among the highest of all
sectors of the economy. Moreover, construction generated much urban
employment during the period, employing 97,000 in 1977 and 170,000 in 1981.
During the 1982-83 depression, the sector's value added dropped 30 percent
from its 1981 peak, and unemployment in the sector reached 45 percent,
leaving 75,003 persons out of work.
2.09      During 1977-1981, housing investment accounted for over 45 percent
of investment in construction; almost four percent of GDP. Then, as the
internal financial situation deteriorated during the depression years,
financing of housing construction from private sources plummeted and in
1982-83 investment in housing fell by 30 percent from its 1981 level.
D.. Housing Policies Past and Present
2.10      Prior to 1973, public housing policies for lower-income groups were
similar to those in many other developing countries. The public sector not
only led in planning and programming, but also in land acquisition,
construction and financing of low-income housing, and even became the
executor during 1970-1973 when the Ministry of Housing and Urbanism (MINVU)
had a total staff of more than 40,000. All Chilean public housing programs
have placed primary emphasis on homeownership. Only occasional and modest
efforts by the Authorities have been undertaken to provide rental housing,
and these were abandoned because of the high costs of maintenance and
administration. Well before most other developing countries, Chile in the
1950's and 1960's was following a progressive low-cost development modsl.
During 1965-1970, 110,000 sites were completed. Subsidies for low-income
groups were in the form of coiacessional interest rates which were regressive
and resulted in large, unplanned transfers to mortgage borrowers. Mortgage
financing during this period was provided by specialized financing
institutions such as the Savings and Loan Associations, which lent at
regulated rates.
2.11      The present Government reduced the public sector's role to one of
guidance, and greatly reduced the public sector administrative structure;
MI1VU employs now less than 4,000 staff and has directed its subsidy programs
into direct, up-front transfers to beneficiaries. The private sector has
been attracted into the role of the developer, not only building, but also



-5-
providing the technology and entrepreneurial capacity, ah3uming some of the
marketing risk, and providing financing for part of the public housing
programs througb the mary full service banks, which lend at market rates.
The individual homeowner is responsible for arranging and contracting
financing as well as directly choosing and purchasing his house.
2.12      The up-front subsidy has the advantage of (i) providing a clear and
current picture of the amounts involved (i.e., they are not hidden in
interest rate subsidies or undervalued house prices) both to the Government
and to the beneficiary; and (ii) contributing to economies in public
administration.
2.13      Mortgage finance has also undergone a fundamental change.  After
liquidation of the Savings and Loan system in the mid-seventies, a
full-service banking system emerged and an old system of issuing bank bonds
to finance mortgage credits was revived. These bonds are sold on the stock
exchange, usually to an institutional investor. Chile's pension funds, in
particular, are currently the prime holders of these mortgage bonds.
Mortgage loans are indexed to inflation and real mortgage rates have tended
to be very high, generally exceeding 12 percent p.a.
2.14      The public sector currently administers four housing programs:  (i)
the Municipal Sanitary Unit Program (MSUP); (ii) the Social Housing Program
(SHP); (iii) the Allocated Subsidy Program (ASP); and (iv) the Contractual
Savings Program (CSP). The first (MSUP) is administered by municipal
authorities, while the other three are administered by NINVU. The NSUP, the
SHP, and the ASP are targetted to benefit groups below the urban poverty
threshold. The new CSP was introduced after the depression began to
stimulate. investment in housing by middle income groups (Annex 4).
2.15      The NSUP was initiated in 1982 as an upgrading program and
comprises the construction of "sanitary core units" (including a bathroom and
a kitchen -- the sanitary core) of between eight and ten square meters in
slum neighborhoods where sewerage trunk lines are available. The unit cost
of these dwellings is currently about 110 U.F.1/ (US$1,900).  Beneficiaries
-- Chile's poorest families -- repay about 20 percent in the form of a
mortgage held by the respective municipality. The remaining 80 percent is
considered a subsidy by the municipality.
2.16      The SHP was established in 1973 to relocate communities that were
unsuitable for upgrading. Under this program, the house provided is one of
minimum size, constructed in batches by private contractors on a turn-key
basis: These houses, the cost of which has fallen from 220-270 U.F.
(US$3,800-4,600) to now 190 U.F. (US$3,300), are priced well below co3i-Irable
houses marketed by the private sector. Contracts are awarded on the basis of
detailed evaluations of competitive bids in response to outline
specifications and a maximum lump sum price. The bidder offering the most
housing units is awarded the contract.  About 75 percent of the house cost is
1/   The Unidad de Fomento (U.F.) is a monetary unit indexed to local
inflation (CPI). One U.F. is currently equel to about US$17.



-6-
subsidized. Houses are assigned to recipients on the basis of their aocial
circumstances. The remaining 25 percent of the house cost is financed by the
beneficiary's savings and a mortgage credit extended by MINVU to the
beneficiary at market terms. Beneficiaries are not allowed to sell for five
years and may only rent with XNVU. permission (Annex 4 and Photographs,
Annex 10).
2.17      The ASP was introduced in 1978.  Applicants must submit information
on the savings they wish to apply toward the purchase of a house as well ae
on their obligations for their dependents. Available subsidies are then
allocated once a year on the basis of a competitive points system which at
present assigns the most weight to savings. The successful applicant
receives a subsidy certificate in one of two house-price categories: a 180
U.F. (Us$3,100) subsidy for a house costing up to 400 U.F. (US$6,800); or a
150 U.F. (US$2,600) subsidy for a house cost ranging between 401 U.F. and 580
U.F. (US$6,801-9,900). The beneficiary then takes his subsidy certificate
and his savings to a commercial bank and arranges mortgage financing (MINVU,
however, is prepared to make a compensatory payment when mortgage bond rates
r.se above an upper limit) for the balance of the cost of his house. Once
having arranged his financing, he is responsible for the construction or
purchase of a house. Subsidy beneficiaries are not allowed to sell their
houses for five years and may only rent their houses with MINVU permisaion
(Annex 4 and Photographs, Annex 10).       -
2.18      The CSP was established in May 1984 as an emergency measure to
stimulate housing construction for middle-income families up to a maximum
value of 2,000 U.F. (US$34,000) per houtse. The major impetus for its
establishment was the disastrous drop in construction and high urban
unemployment. The program rewards competitive savings efforts (amount and
length of the savings effort) with a combination of an upfront cash bonus and
a maximum mortgage credit of 1,000 U.F. (US$17,000) with interest rate
support. It is estimated that, on average, financial assistance of 150 U.?.
(US$2,600) can be realized per beneficiary (Annex 4 - paras. 10-13). While
the program is likely to provide additional employment during the current
period of depressed economic activity, the fact that it benefits higher
income groups makes the CSP an unsuitable program for public subsidy. For
this reason, its reduction and rapid elimination is an objective of both the
Government and this lending operation (para. 3.04).
E. Bank Strategy in the Sector
2.19  *   The Bank's strategy in Chile's housing sector involves providing
medium- to longer-term assistance that will improve (i) the efficiency of
resource allocation and (ii) distributional equity in the sector. At this
juncture, investment in public housing programs has an important immediate
role to play in helping generate much-needed employment during the period of
economic reactivation ahead. The proposed project, which would complement
IDB's support of the MSUP, is expected to be the first of a series. The
dialogue between the Bank and MINYU during project preparation and appraisal
has already resulted in improvements in the efficiency and focus of MINVU's
programs and further progress is expected during implementation of the
project (paras. 3.05-3.07). The project would also include policy and



-7-
operational studies which would enable the Government to'levelop reforms to
further improve its housing sector operations, which would be supported by
future loans.
III. THE PROJECT
3.01      This would be the first 3ank-financed housing project in Chile.
The project was prepared by MINVU with Bank aeaiatance. Bank misaions
visited Chile to appraise the project in April and November 1983.
A. Project Objectives and Description
3.02      The objectives of Bank participation in the proposed project would
be (i) to support the Government's effort to ardress sector issues such as
reducing and eliminating subsidies, increasing cost recovezy, improving
targetiLg, reviewing structural factors, of the high cost of mortgage finance
and introducing alternative sector policies; and (ii) to generate employment
in housing construction and help reactivate the economy.
3.03      The project supports MINVU's ongoing housing programs and consists
of: (i) a package of policy improvements; (ii) the construction of about
68,000 houses under the SHP; (iii) the construction of about 47,000 houses
under the ASP; and (iv) studies and other technical assistance to address key
sector issues (Annex 7). -'The project would cover a time elice of the SHP and
ASP for the years 1984-87. Studies and other technical assistance would also
be undertaken during this period.
B. Policy Improvements
3.04      During pro,ect preparation, an intense dialogue was conducted
with the Chilean Authorities which resulted in the introduction of several
improvements in MIMVU programs. Theae include:
(a) in the SHP, achieving a 14 percent reduction in the unit cost
per house to 190 U.F. (4.01 (b)).through lower housing
standards, increasing recovery by reducing the maximum subsidy
from 90 percent to 75 percent of the house price and including
as a criterion for selecting beneficiaries the level and
consistency of their savings effort.
(b)  in the ASP, achieving a 10 percent reduction of the grants and
improving the targeting by imposing a maximum income
limitation for beneficiaries and eliminating.the two most
costly categories of houses eligLble under the program; and
(c) in the CSP, achieving a substantial reduction in financial
assistance awards from 35,000 to 24,D00 beneficiaries during
1984-86 and eliminating the program thereafter.
These measures are expected to produce immediate savings of about US$33
million per year (Annex 5). The Governaent intends to use these funds
initially to help finance about 11,000 additional units per year; when the



-8-
need for a high level of public sector investment in houses decreases,
savings could be applied to other high priority programs.  To provide the
Government with sufficient flexibility to achieve near-term macroeconomic
benefits from its housing program while ensuring a balanced public
investment, agreement was reacted to limit spending on MINVU's housing
programs (including slippages carried from year to year) in each year during
the execution of this project to the equivalent of US$200 million in current
terms (para. 4.01(a)).
3.05      The improvements described above would be carried further during
project implementation. The Government agreed to eliminate the intexnediate
(580 U.F.) category under the ASP (para. 4.01(h)). The subsidy per house
under the SHP and the ASP would be progressively reduced by at least 10 U.P.
per year, starting not later than July 31, 1986. Prior to December 31, 1988,
the subsidy reductions would be subject to review if the Government provides
evidence on the basis of indicators acceptable to the Bank (such as the rate
of unemployment, trends in real income and construction cost, etc.) that such
reductions are not feasible (para. 4.01(d)). Additionally, the SHP and ASP
would be restructured no later than December 31, 1988 to eliminate subsidies
taking into consideration the results of policy studieb and the need for an
orderly transitional period (para. 4.01(e)). As an intermediate step,
agreement was reached that the subsidy on the 400 U.F. house, which was
lowered to_180 U.F. in 1984, will be reduced to 165 starting CY 1985 (para.
4.01(c)). This level compares with 200 U.F. for the SHP and the ASP in
1983.  Additionally, targeting of beneficiaries would be improved fron July
1985 on through extending to the ASP the selection criterion, rewarding the
consistency of savings efforts by beneficiaries, already introduced under the
SHP (para. 4.01(i)).
3.06      To establish a basis for further policy reform and operational
improvements, the project would include more detailed studies of the factors
underlying the high cost of mortgage finance in Chile, the housing market and
alternative Government housing policies, and improvements in MINVU
operations. These matters were reviewed carefully during project preparation
and the Government agreed that the additional studies would be completed by
December 31, 1986. After they are reviewed with the Bank, a plan of action
would be prepared for implementing their recommendations not later than
December 31, 1987 (para. 4.01(j)).
3.07      Since the CSP has just been introduced and because of the need to
provide economic stimulus 'his program will continue in the short run. But
in view of undesirable features of the program, agreement was reached to
reduce the number of financial assistance awards from 35,000 to 24,000 during
1984-86 and to eliminate the program thereafter (para. 4.01(f)).
C.  MINVU Portfolio Administration
3.08      Owing to unresolved deficiencies in the records system of credits
made during previous administrations and the recent econcmic crisis, arrears
in MIJVU's mortgage portfolio (countrywide there are about 245,000 borrowers)
reached very high levels -- about 45 percent of current billings were
overdue in mid-1984-. Because of the pronounced disparity of income and



-9-.
inflation trends, inflation indexed loans are being restructured
countrywide. In this context, NIEVU is about to restructure repayment
schedules of its loans which will bring accounts up to date. Over the past
few years, M1ENVU has taken measures to improve collections, including hiring:
(i) private firms for computing, billing and collecting; and (ii) a
commercial bank to manage a portion of the portfolio. Agreement was reached
to review all aspects of its loan portfolio administration by December 31,
1985 and to implement jointly agreed follow-up measures by not later than
June 30, 1986 (para. 4.01(g)).
D. Project Costs and Financing
3.09      Total investment costs of the project including price contingencies
have been estimated to be US$576.8 million equivalent. These estimates were
derived by multiplying the housing unit mar-ket prices times the programmed
number of dwellings to be built during the project period (1984-1987). Esti-
mates of required consultancy services-and other expenditures related to the
technical assistance program were then added on. As market prices are either
derived from lump sum contracts (SHP) or from maximum transaction prices
(ASP), there is no need to allow for physical contingencies. The Central
Bank is expected to adjust the foreign exchange rate relative to the US
dollar over the project period taking into account the difference between
local and international inflation. Therefore, price contingencies are
calculated on US dollar base values (expressed in prices of September 30,
1984.) and are estimated to be 3.5 percent for 1984, eight percent for 1985
and nine percent thereafter (Annex 6).
3.10      The Bank loan of US$80.0 mill-ion would finance about 14 percent of
the project costs or the estimated foreign exchange cost.  Forty percent of
total project cost is estimated to be financed by beneficiaries through down
payments (15 percent) and commercial mortgage credits (25 percent), and
budgetary resources of MINVU would cover 46 percent. The Bank loan would
fi.nance the front end fee of US$0.2 million, USS79.0 million would fund (in
equal shares of US$39.5 million) a proportion of the SHP and of the ASP until
these funds are exhausted and US$0.8 million would partially fund consulting
services for sector and wrtgage finance reviews and other technical
assistance.
3.11      Commercial mortgage funds over four years should not be difficult
to secure as the credit demand by ASP beneficiaries is estimated to anount to
about one-sixth of the yearly mar-ket for mortgage bonds. However, it was
agreed that MINVU-maintain its agreement with Banco del Estado to grant
mortgage credits to ASP beneficiaries (para. 4.01(k)). It was also confirmed
that the level of interest rates NINVU is guaranteeing under SHP and ASP
would be in line with market conditions (para. 4.01(k)).
E. Procurement
3.12      Procarement for the SXP would be in accordance with ICB. MINVU's
procurement procedures have been reviewed and found to be satisfactory,
subject to the adjustments indicated below.  Under the SHP, bids are invited
for a maximum lump sum on the basis of technical guidelines and contracts are
then awarded to bidders with the best solution, tncluding both technical



-1 0-
aspects as well as the number of housing soLutions, determined by a sound
evaluating system developed by MINVU over several years of experience.
Contractors are prequalified through registration in the National
Contractors' Register on the basis of their technical (equipment available,
past experience, etc.) andifinancial capacity. Foreign firms would be
invited to register and participate in the bidding through annual
announcements in the "Development Foram" and by informing the local
embassies. Foreign contractors would also have to prove their experience and
retain a local technical representative. Confirmation was obtained that
contracts would be awarded under-ICB to the bidder with the lowest evaluated
proposal with no restriction applied which is inconsistent with Bank
Guidelines (para. 4.01(1)). All bidding/contracts packages over US$500,000
each would be subject to prior Bank review; other contracts would be subject
to post-award review.
3.13      Under the ASP, no procurement by XINVU takes place as subsidy
beneficiaries are themselves responsible to contract the house purchase.
Thus, no ICB or LCB procedures are applicable. The nature of the operation
(thousands of beneficiaries individually contracting their houses) also
precludes the wholesale purchase of material either locally or abroad.
3.14      Consulting services would be contracted in line with the Bank's
guidelines. Firms registered in NINYU's Consultant Register would be invited
to submit proposals. Proposals would be evaluated by a MINVU commission
according to criteria advertised in the invitation documents. For those
services that would require expatriate expertise, a short list of consultants
would be prepared by 14INVIJ and approved by the Bank. Subsequent registration
in JEIVU's consulting register would then be permitted.
7.  Disbursements
3.15      Projected Bank disbursements have been phased and disbursement
percentages established to ensure adequate Bank participation throLghout the
execution period consistent with the Bank loan financing an average 14
percent of the project expenditures. Disbursements against the Government's
share of the project would be as follows: (i) Social Housing Program (SHP):
25 percent of MINVU expenditures; (ii) Allocated Subsidy Program (ASP): 75
percent of NINVU expenditures for new houses in the 400 U.P.category; and
(iii) ConsultLng Services and Studies: 70 percent of MINVU contractual
expenditures.
3.16      Loan funds would be disbursed over a period of about four years,
and the Closing Date would be December 31, 1988 (Annex 8). Disbursements
would be made on the basis of full contractual docunwntation in the case of
studies and technical assistance and all SEP contracts above US$200,000
equivalent. For SHP contracts below this limit, and for the ASP,
disbursements would be based on statements of expenditures (SOE). Bank
supervision missions would review the contractual documeutation and SOE
retained by INIVU.
3.17      IINVU has introduced policy changes agreed during appraisal in
anticipation of this loan being approved in early 1984.  Commitments made
after January 1, 1984., by JIMVU under the 1983 ASP (400 U.F. category only),



* ~~~-11 -
would be retroactively financed subject to a ceiling of US$8.0 million
equivalent.
3.18      To reduce the interval during which NINVU would fund the Bank's
share of the project, a Spepial Account in US dollars would be set up in the
Central Bank. The initial capitalization of US$8.6 million would reflect the
estimated maximum financial requirement of a three month period.
Replenishment of the special account would occur on the basis of standard
Bank procedures. XINVU would be entitled to make withdrawals in local
currency at the rate of exchange applicable on the day correaponding
expenditures payments were made if such payments were made within 60 days
prior to the request for withdrawals from the Special Account. Otherwise,
the exchange rate of the date of withdrawal would apply. Independent
auditors satisfactory to the Bank would submit a report on the special
account not later than April 30, following the close of the financial year
(para. 4.01(n)).
G. Accounting and Monitoring
3.19      Agreement was reached that NINMVU would establish a project account
and information system to allow clear identification of the cost and
financing of items financed by the Bank and to allow monitoring of sectoral
policies (Annex 9, Key Indicators). This account and monitoring system
would be audited by auditors satisfactory to the Bank and audit reports would
be submitted within four months following the close of the financial year
(para. 4.01(n)).
H. Project Justification
3.20      The project is justified, first, in terms of its contribution to
meeting the need for low-income housing in Chile. This would be two-fold:
through provision of 115,000 additional houses to low-income families and
through immediate and longer-ter& policy and operational improvements which
will increase the replicability of the program. The income limitation for
beneficiaries under the ASP introduced during project preparation will result
in approximately 575,000 people falling below the urban poverty threshold
benefiting from the program.
3.21      The sectoral improvements being introduced would improve the
replicability of the Government's program in low-income housing by allowing a
larger number of dwellings to be offered while maintaining constant real
expe4ditures beyond the life of this lending operation.  Total approved NINVU
capital expenditures for 1984 are about 12 percent of the Central Government
budget. By 1986 this could be reduced to less than ten percent assuming the
budget were to increase in real terms at between four and five percent per
annum in line with expected economic growth and providing that the Government
maintains a high priority for low-income housing.
3.22      An additional justification to the project is its contribution to
reactivating the economy. In 1984, to help stimulate economic recovery, the
public sector budget allocated for a housing construction program an amount
equaling about 36 percent of the overall public sector's deficit for the



-12-
year. Three aspects of this program will help in solving the current
economic crisis in Chile. First, given the current unemployment levels (in
particular in the construction sector) the multiplier effects of the program
are expected to be significant. It is estimated that under present economic
conditions, about 250 gross job-years are created per US$1 million investment
in housing. Second, housing as!a whole has a lower foreign exchange
component (less than 15 percent) than other public sector works, thus
reducing Chile's need to use scarce foreign exchange in reactivating the
economy. Finally, housing investment can be started or stopped quickly,
thereby allowing the size of the investment program to be adjusted without
major loss or disruption should macroeconomic circumstances dictate. Hence,
housing investment would comprise a flexible and strategic tool with
multiplier effects that are at least as favorable and with lower foreign
exchange leakages than alternative additions to the public sector investment
program. It would also provide an important social need. It is estimated
that a Bank loan of US$80 million would, during the 1984-1987 project period,
lead to incremental investment of about US$150 million which would generate
about 40,000 gross job-years.
I.   Project Risks
3.23      The major risks of this Project are:  (i) a possible future
reduction in the budgetary resources of MINVU; (ii) a possible decrease in
the utilization of subsidies by benefi-ciaries under ASP; and (iii)
difficulties in the implementation of the agreed policy improvements.
3.24      Given the uncertainty of future economic developments and the
difficulty of managing MINVU's mortgage portfolio, future recoveries from
past lending could be less than expected. However, 14INVU would be able to
compensate possible shortfalls with sale of assets, primarily land and the
Central Government is expected to continue assigning high priority to its
public housing programs.  More uncertainty exists in relation to the actual
use of subsidy certificates, should savings levels decrease, real income
continue to fall, construction costs surge dramatically, or interest rates
remain high. Should implementation under the ASP stall, Bank funds would be
reallocated to the SHP where construction is directly controlled by MINVU.
Regarding further policy improvements, the Bank's long-term presence in the
sector provides a strong incentive for an appropriate policy reorientation.
IV. RECOMMENDATIONS
4.01      During negotiations the following agreements were reached:
(a) The public sector shall not, without the consent of the Bank,
spend in any year more than US$200 million equivalent for its
housing programs of NINVU (para. 3,04).
(b) Effective CY 1985, )IIVU would invite bids for its SHP at
maximum lump sums which would result in cost per unit of not
more than 190 U.F. or in such low cost to which the market
would be responsive (para. 3.04).



-13-
(c)  Effective with the 1985 allocation reduce'the subsidy for the
400 U.F. category 165 U.F. (para. 3.05).
(d)  MINVU would decrease the subsidy in its ASP and SHP by at
least 10 U.F. per year commencing with the CY 1986
allocations, unless -- following consultation with the Bank
during the last trimester of the prior year -- agreed indices
demonstrate that such reductions are not possible (para.
3.05).
(e) MINVU would restructure the SHP and ASP not later than
December 31, 1988, to eliminate subsidies taking into account
the results of policy studies and the need for an orderly
transitional period (para. 3.05).
(f)  MINVU would allocate during 1984-19A6 a maximum of 24,000
financial assistance awards under the CSP and abolish the
program thereafter (para. 3.07).
(g)  MINVU would review all aspects of its loan portfolio
administration by December 1985. Jointly agreed follow-up
measures would be implemented no later than June 30, 1986
(para. 3.08).   --
(h) NINVU would abolish the 580 U.F. category effective with the
1985 subsidy allocation (para. 3.05).
Wi) Effective not later than July 31, 1985, MINV" would include in
ASP premium points to reward the consistency of savings
(para. 3.05).
(j) MINVU would carry out agreed sector and mortgage finance
studies by December 31, 1986 and act on jointly agreed
conclusions derived from these studies by December 31, 1987
(para. 3.06).
(k)  MINVU would maintain its agreement with Banco del Estado to
grant mortgage credits to ASP beneficiaries, and MINNU's
interest rate guarantees for SHP and ASP would be in line with
market conditions (para. 3.11).
(1)  NINVU would inform foreign firms about bidding possibilities
and their need to register by advertising in the Development
Forum and by informing local embassies of intended bid
invitations, and would award contracts to bidders according to
Bank guidelines (para. 3.12).
(m) MINVU would establish a project account and information system
to follow-up on Bank financed items and sectoral policies
(para. 3.19).



-1 4-
(n) MINVU would employ independent auditors satisfactozy to Bank
to audit the special and project accounts and the information
system (key indicators) and submit these reports not later
than April 30 of each year (paras. 3.18 and 3.19).

CHILE
PUBLIC SECTOR HOUSING PROJECT
Sector Institutions
1.        There are well developed public and private institutions
operating in the sector. The main public institutions and their respective
functions are:
- The Ministry of Housing and Urbanism (NINVU) is the dominant
sector authority and is responsible for setting national housing
and urban development policies, elaborating national housing
programs and plans, approving construction norms and standards,
carrying out its own investment programs, and improving financial
access to housing, especially for lower income groups.- (Further
details are given in Annex 2.)
- The Ministry of Finance and the Office of National Planning
(ODEPLAN) jointly develop economic development plans. The former
approves and controls yearly budget allocations to NINVU.
ODEPLAN also carries out broad sectoral studies related to
economic planning.
- The Ministry of Interior (YDI) has assumed a role in housing
since 1982 when municipalities were charged with the sanitary
core unit program.  MOI is the government department charged with
overseeing the 318 municipalities of Chile.
- The Central Bank of Chile has traditional3y provided financing
for housing only in times of crisis. For instance, in 1983 it
established several financing lines for housing, the most
important of which was targeted to reduce the large stock of
unsold middle and upper income houses.
- "Banco del Estado," the state owned and largest commercial bank,
has agreed with MINIU to grant mortgage credits to subsidy
beneficiaries under ASP.
2.        Given the emphasis on economic liberalization and on the
reduction of the bureacratic apparatus of the public sector, the private
sector -- both profit and non profit -- has developed a substantial role in
housing.
- The Construction Industry, with about 2,000 firms registered with
MINVU, is well developed and uses efficient building techniques.
Most of the large construction companies also act as housing
developers, assuming the responsibility for planning, design,
land purchase, construction, and sales. Contractors are well
represented by a trade association (Construction Chamber of
Chile).

AJNEX 1
Page 2 of 2
- There are many economic and architectural consulting firms, as
well as a well-developed industry for the provision of life and
fire insurance.
- Both the major universities, The University of Chile and the
Catholic University of Chile, sponsor housing institutes, which
provide a forwm for debate and the generation of scholarly
treatises on housing policies and programs.
- The "Fundacion de Viviendas - Hogar de Cristo," a non-profit
organization, has produced over 150,000 pre-fabricated basic
wooden dwellings in the last twenty years, which are sold --
mostly at highly subsidized prices -- to the poor.
- Chile has also had a long tradition of housing cooperatives, with
most of the members drawn from the middle income groups. A
number of other non-profit organizations have sprung up to
represent those families which are doubling up in houses, or to
orgEnize additional housing cooperatives.
- Mortgage loans for housing are granted in Chile by about 25
commercial financial institutions (Banks and "Financieras").
A.bout 40% of all housing loans were granted by "Banco del Estado"
and "Banco Hipotecario y de Fomento Nacional."

CHILE
PUBLIC SECTOR HOUSING PROJECT
Organization and Finances of MINVU
1.        MINVU is headquartered in Santiago, but also has regional
operating units. At the central level in Santiago MINVU is technically
supported by five departments in the areas of urban development, housing
policy, finance, legal matters and research. There are six addi:ional
support units, one of which is the Office for the Coordination of Foreign
Credits. The latter office has assisted in project preparation and would
function as the coordinating point of contact during supervision. At the
regional level MINVU is represented in each of the twelve regions and in
metropolitan Santiago by regional offices (Secretarias Regionales
Ministeriales) and by operating authorities (Servicios de Vivienda y
Urbanizacion-SERYIUS).  MINVU is headed by a minister who in turn is
assisted by a deputy minister and by a special group of experienced
advisors.
2.        MINVU's staff numbered about 40,000 in the early seventies when
MIIVU itself was carrying out a massive construction program. Its staff
now totals less than 4,000 as a result of the transfer of substantial
responsibilities in planning, design, constraction, marketing and finance
to the private sector. Competence and morale of staff is good as
individual responsibility and efficiency has increased greatly with the
trimdown of personnel since the mid seventies.
MINVU Accounting, Reporting and Audit
3.        By law (D.L. 1263), the Contraloria General de la Republica
establishes the accounting principles, procedures and reporting formats
which Government entities such as MINVU need to follow. The manuals were
introduced in 1976 and require the establishment and maintenance of
accounting subsystems which relate primarily to budget execution, flow of
funds, asset and debt management. These manuals also specify the
information flow and reporting formats required at the regional as well as
at the national level. MINVU reports monthly on the status of budget
execution to the Contraloria and to the Ministry of Finance. Financial
planning has been carried out through the yearly budget process (in line
with present Government practices). N4INVU employs competent professionals
who, aided by computing facilities, produce timely and comprehensive
financial reports. MINVU's system of control also includes an Internal
Audit Department which has been in existence since the early seventies and
which has the task to permanently supervise the legal aspects of MINVU's
transactions. The annual external audit is carried out by the
Contraloria. The mission's view is that XINVU's existing auditing and
control systems (the mortgage portfolio excluded -- paras. 6-7 below) are
satisfactory.

MINVUIS Finances
4.        MINVU's financial transactions are reflected in its budget.
Each year a budget law is passed approving its expenditures and direct
Government contributions. In comparison to the 1981-83 period, both the
overall budget as well as the direct government contribution were increased
sharply in 1984 and the declining levels (of the 1981-83 period) are now
being reversed. MINVU's 1981-1983 budgets reflected the macroeconomic
condition of the country with the end of the boom period (1981) and the
onset and continuation of the depression (1982/83). While budget levels
stood at Cb$ 16.1 billion in 1981, they had declined steadily to Ch$ 11.9
billion in 1983. For 1984 total expenditures of Cb$ 21.6 billion (US$247
million equivalent) were approved.
5.        During 1981-83 about 60% of ICNVU's budget was devoted to capital
investment, largely in the housing sector, and it derived about 36% of its
budgetaxr sources from interest and principal payments from its mortgage
portfolio. By comparison, in 1984 MINVU's capital expenditures are
expected to reach 62% of the budget and the mortgage portfolio recovery
finance only about 28% of the budget. During the 1981-1983 period the
Central Government financed about 34% of lINVU's budget. In 1984 this
proportion was increased to 42%. Further details are shown in the
Attachment to this Annex.
MINVU's Mortgage Portfolio
6.        NINVU has been a mortgage lender to low income beneficiaries for
over 15 years. It is estimated that there are about 245,000 mortgage
debtors countrywide, of which about 156,000 (64%) are in the Santiago
metropolitan area alone. MINVU began in 1980 a major effort to establish
an accurate records system and to increase collections. In fact, actual
collections in 1981 increased about 48% over its budget projections. The
major specific steps taken to increase the yield of the portfolio included
the subcontracting of a computerized billing system and of the actual
collection to outside firms, and the contracting of a commercial bank which
specializes in mortgage lending (Banco Hipotecario y de Fomento Nacional -
BEIF) to manage a major portion of the portfolio. The fee structure agreed
with BHIP F-cludes premium payments tied to collection levels.
Poreclosures have been rare, except in the portfolio managed by E3HIF.
NINVU began in 1983 to prepare a massive plan to selectively foreclose
among 20,000 potential cases, but beeause of the economic and political
circumstances no action has been taken.
7.        The portfolio managed by BHIF involves about 16,000 loans made by
NINVU to subsidy beneficiaries under ASP. The aggregate loan value
amounted to US$110 million equivalent. For this portion of the portfolio
accurate records exist. What the outstanding amount of all NINVU loans is
cannot be determined with amy accuracy, as the records of prior
administrations -- although improved -- remain sketchy. Total actual debt



- 19 -
A¶NNEX 2
Page 3 of 3
service payments in 1983 amounted to Ch$ 4.5 billion, which represented a
decrease of 6% over 1982 and of 17% over 1981. The major reason for this
downturn is increased delinquency due to the mac-oeconomic deterioration.
In early 1984 MINVU estimated that about 45% of the amounts currently due
to MINVU are three months or more overdue.  The delinquency rate in the
mortgage portfolio managed by BHIF is more reasonable. As of November
1983, EHI? reports that of all cumulative amounts currently due, 2.6% or
(US$1.4 million) were overdue three months or more.
8.        In view of the mounting disparity of trends in real incomes and
inflation, the Central Bank was compelled to provide financing to
reschedule debt which are indexed to inflation and foreign exchange rates.
The rescheduling was put into effect in early July 1984 and benefits:
(a) About 50,000 mortgage borrowers.
(b) About 150,000 borrowers of commercial loans.
Cc) About 220,000 borrowers of consumer credits.
9.        The rescheduling allows debt service extensions for all loans
contracted before March 1, 1983. Initially debt service payments will be
60% of the original obligation and .will grow 3% per year. The deferred
payments carry a below market rate. The system allows also to include in
the rescheduling up to 24 months of mortgage payments in arrears.
10.       In addition MINVU is introducing discounts for borrowers who
following a rescheduling agreement keep payments up to date.

PUBLIC SECTOR HOUSING PROJECT
The 1984-1987 Housing Sector Investment Plan
1.        In line with the deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and the
sectoi- issues identified over recent years, the authorities began in 1983
to develop a multi-year investment and financing plan for housing. This
was a departure from the traditional year-to-year planning and was meant to
inject into the private sector a new confidence based on the knowledge of
continuous public sector support. The projected investments include
expenditures related to land, the specific housing solutions and
infrastructure.
2.        Between 1984-87 it is expected that a total of 50,000 to 70,000
housing solutions will be completed per year at an aggregate expenditure
(in constant terms) of about US$2.4 billion equivalent. Public resources,
i.e. mostly the upfront cash subsidy, are expected to finance about 23%,
and private resources, i.e. savings and mortgage credits, about 77%. The
underlying assumption of the plan is that private sector initiatives will
increase as overall economic conditions improve.
Investment Program of Public Sector
3.        Public Sector involvement in housing consists of the programs of
MINVU and those of the Municipalities. MINVU is the dominant actor in the
Public Sector, directly providing in 1984 about 74% of the public sector
housing solutions and 84% of the funding. While the municipal sector wouldt
continue to build housing solutions as part of an ongoing upgrading
program, MINVU will support the construction of fully built housing
solutions. In 1984 the public sector expects to complete about 44,000
solutions, of which 13,000 (30%) would be aunicipal sanitary core units.
By 1987 the public sector projects to complete 59,000 solutions, but this
is predicated on the success of the yet untested Contractual Savings
Program introduced in May of 1984. Public Sector supported investment in
1984 is estimated at US$192 million, with public resources financing US$118
million, or about 61%. By 1987, public sector investment would rise to
US$325 million, with public resources financing a decreased share of about
41%. This decrease would reflect the increased weight of the Contractual
Savings Program which is subsidized at a lesser level. Public resources
are composed of the resources of the Central Government of MINVU and of the
Municipalities. The targets in the Municipal Program as well as under the
MINVU SHP and ASP are in line with the present record of achievement and
appear reasonable.
Projected Private Sector Investments
4.        Private residential housing construction for middle/upper income
levels, without direct Public Sector support, is projected only at a low
level. For 1984 the Private Sector expects to complete about 4,000 housing

units, which represents a moderate increase over 1983 but a small fraction
of private sector involvement during the recent boom years of 1979-1981.
Financing will come entirely from private resources, i.e. savings and
commercial mortgage credits. Although in terms of units the private sector
represents less than 10% of sector activities in terms of units provided,
its financial participation in the investment plan is still expected to be
40% because of the high average price per house this sector covers
(estimated at an average of about US$52,000 per unit).

in attached Schedules A, B and C.

CHILE
PUBLIC SECTOR HOUSING PROJECT
Ongoing Public Housing Programs
1.        Present housing programs in Chile rely significantly more than
their predecessors on the use of the private sector for planning, design,
construction, administration, sales and finance. The public sector
administers lump sum contracts and the allocation of upfront subsidies.
Housing programs cover all geographic areas in the country with no special
regional emphasis, except for efforts made to ensure the allocation of some
benefits: (i) to the rural areas through a special subsidy allocation for
rural housing in 1981; and (ii) to the isolated areas of the extreme South
in order to encourage settlement there.
2.        The major programs now in operation include:  (i) the MINVU
Social Housing Program, (ii) the MINVU Allocated Subsidy Program, (iii) the
MINVU Contractual Savings Program, and (iv) the Municipal Sanitary Core
Units Program. Technical details of the SHP and ASP are discussed in the
kttachment.
The MINVU Social Housing Program (SHF)
3.        This program was started in 1973 to relocate commnities which
were unsuitable for upgrading. The housing solution offered consists of a
fully built first-stage-house of a minimum size.  MI1wVU calls regularly for
competitive bids giving outline specifications and offering a limp sum
contract price. Bids are evaluated through a detailed point system, and
contracts are awarded to the bidder offering the highest number of-
dwellings. Including land and all infrastrLlcture, these houses have
typically cost U.F. 220-270 (US$3,800-4,600o-) About 75-90% of the cost has
been subsidized to beneficiaries selected by MINVU. The remaining 10-25%
has been financed by a mortgage credit granted by XINVU at 12% p.a. in real
terms over 12 years. The competitive bidi&ng process has encouraged
competition and efficiency in the contracting industry. The prices
achieved through this process are judged to be low, and the construction
period is rapid (300-500 houses per site of good quality construction are
typically completed in 4-5 months). This compares very favorably with the
experience in other Latin American countries.
4.        The transfer of communities originally selected under this
program is now almost complete and X¢NVU is finalizing new procedures to
continue the program by assigning houses to individual households on the
basis of prior savings and social need.
The  OINVU Allocated Subsidy Program (ASP)
5.        Under this program MINVU publically invites individual household
to submit subsidy applications. Applicants need to provide information on:
(i) the level of savings accumulated for the house purchase and (ii) other



- 27 -
ANNEX 4
Page 2 of 3
social factors. Available subsidies are allocated on the basis of a
points system which presently rewards primarily savings levels. Subsidy
beneficiaries are not allowed to sell the house during a five year period
and rentals are only allowed with permission of MINVU. The administrative
procedures were reviewed and found to be satisfactory.
6.        Prior to mid-1984 1INVU has allocated about 84,000 subsidy
certificates under this program from about 336,000 applicants. Subsidy
beneficiaries use the MINVU subsidy certificate to pay contractors for part
of the cost of new (or, as a last resort, of used) hot'ses. IINVU has
traditionally allocated subsidies once a year. Since 1983 the number of
subsidies allocated has increased from 10,000 to about 17,0 per annum.
7.        The amount of the individual subsidy certificate depends on the
price of the house which the applicant desires; the higher the price, the
lower the subsidy. The detailed categories are:
Maximum House Price                       Subsidy
Up to 400 U.F.                 180 U.F.
From 401 U.F. to 580 U.F.                 150 U.F.
8.        Thus, in the lowest category the subsidization level
represents 45% of the allowed maximum house price. This proportion drops
to 26% in the next category.
9.        llost of the subsidy certificates have been assigned to the lowest
category. Starting in 1983, 74% of all subsidies were allocated to the 400
U.F. category. However, not all allocated subsidies have been used. As of
November 1983, MINVU had actually paid 52% of all subsidies allocated.
This low percentage reflects: (i) initial difficulties in 1978-1980 to
implement this new and unusual system, and (ii) the failure of one special,
and now discontinued, form of subsidy allocation.
NINVU's New Contractual Savings Program
10.       Because of the need to reactivate the depressed economy, MINVU
introduced this program in May ')84 to urgently stimulate investments in
housing by the middle income families. NINVU plans to award up to 24,000
subsidies during 1984-1986.
11.       Participation in this program is preconditioned on achievement of
a svings target during a minimum period as per a savings contract
concluded with a recognized financial institution.  Amy source of liquidity
can be used to meet the commitments of the savings contract.
12.       The program rewards savings efforts in a competitive process
which on the basis of a point system awards an up-front bonus and/or the



- 28 -
ANNEX 4
Page 3 of 3
availability of below-market-rate-mortgage-credit. Applicants, can opt to
compete in two categories. Category "A" allows a maximum mortgage loan of
U.F. 500 (US$8,500 equivalent) and a maximum up-front bonus of 130 U.F.
(US$2,200 equivalent). Category nB" allows a maximum mortgage loan of
U.F. 1,000 (US$17,000 equivalent) and a maximum up-front bonus of 110 U.F.
(US$1,900 equivalent).  Mortgage loans will benefit from interest support
up to a limit of 130 U.F. (US$2,200).  The maximum realizable subsidy is
U.F. 260 (US34,400). The maximum house value is limited to U.F.2,000
(US$34,000 equivalent).
13.       The point system rewards:
) The absolute level of saving (1 point for each 1 U.F.
saved);
(b) The continuity of savings (8 points for each month during
which the agreed average savings level was maintained);
Cc) The number of obligations for dependents (10 points for each
"carga familiar");
Cd) Requests for less than the maximum upfront bonus (for
instance, 150 points are assigned to a party requesting no
up-front
bonus);
Ce) Requests for less than the maximum mortgage credit (0.2
points for each U.F. less than the allowed maximum mortgage
loan amount).
Municipal Sanitary Core Units Program
14.       Locally called casetas sanitarias, this constitutes a revival and
refinement of a program started in the fifties. It consists in the
erection of 8-10 m2 sanitazy core units, which include a bathroom and a
kitchen. These units are pert of an upgrading effort and are built in
existing poor neighborhoods where sewerage trunk lines are available, bat
where the houses lack individual connections. Organizationally the
responsibility for carrying out this program has been placed since 1982
with the municipalities which, by comparison to NINVU, were considered
better equipped to deal with individual neighborhoods. The program has
been primarily funded by municipal resources and by a recent loan of the
IDB. The unit cost is at present about U.F. 110, of which beneficiaries
repay about 20% in the form of a mortgage credit given by the respective
municipalities. The remaining 80% are considered a cash subsidy.

Detailed Technical Aspects of KINVU's Social Housing
and Allocated Subsidy Programs 'I
Site Selection Procedures   I
1.        Every town with at least 7,000 inhabitants is required to have a
City Plan (Plan Renulador) that establishes land use, major street system,
location of community facilities, urban limits, areas served by utilities
and areas for priority development. These Plans need to be updated
periodically. The selection of sites for housing purposes is made within
the rules of the open land market and taking into consideration the
recommendations of the Plan Regulador.
Site Planning Standards and Subdivision Regulations
2.        Site planning standards and subdivision regulations are
established by the Ordenanza General de Construccion y Urbanizacion, within
the provisions of the Ley General de Urbanismo y Construcciones.
Applications for approval of land subdivision projects are made by the
interested party to the Direccion de Obras at the Nunicipality, where all
building permits are issued. Subdivisions have to comply with local urban
development plan (Plan Regulador), specifically in relation to land use,
density, and major street system.
3.        The utility companies, which are both private and public in
Chile, provide and manage utility infrastructure. The technical standards
for water distribution, sewerage, gas and electrical systems are
established by the Instituto Nacional de Normas (INN), but are subject to
MINVU ' s approval.
4.        General provisions require all housing subdivisions to be within
urban development limits and to have adequate access roads, basic
utilities, paved streets, and a minimum lot size of 160 m2. For social
housing, lower standards have been established:
(a) Minimum standards are applied by utility companies;
(b) Densities must be at least 300 persons per hectare, or 50
units per hectare;2/
1/ Based on the findings of Mr. Cesar Garces (Consultant).
2/ This includes the net lot and proportioned street, pedestrian and open
space areas.



- 30 -
ANNEX 4
Attachment
Page 2 of 8
(c) Whenever the land subdivision is part of a project involving
the concomitant building of dwelling units, the lot size can
be reduced to 100 m2, internal streets for vehicular traffic
to seven mtso, right of way and pedestrian paths to
six mts. (with a minimum of three mts. for occasional
service vehicular traffic);
(d)  The pavement usually required for streets is waived but the
surface is stabilized; streets must be graded and curbs
built.
5.        For most projects under NINVU's SHP, the land use distribution is
as follows: lots for dwellings, 50 to 55%; community facilities, 20 to
25%; and the street system, 20%. The minimum site planning standarde used
in Chile are similar to the ones established by other countries in Latin
America such as Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela and Brazil. The Chilean
standards for low-cost housing and the level of maintenance required are
appropriate.
6.        Housing design standards for houses under the SHP are established
by D.Y.L. No. 2 in general terms and in more detail by the special bidding
conditions. They refer to the minimum requirement to fulfill domestic
functions of the first construction stage, including a living-dining room,
one bedroom with closet space, a kitchen, and a bathroom. The house should
be designed to allow for future expansion of at least two bedrooms and
additional storage space. The most commonly used type is a detached house
on a 100 m2 lot with 2.5 mts. front and site yards and a larger backyard to
accommodate expansion.
7.        The minimum standards for houses under the ASP are also
established by D.F.L. No. 2. The results of a survey made by MINVU in July
of 1981 show that the average size for dwelling in the 260 to 400 UF range
was 47.57 m2, for the 401 to 580 UF range 56.97 m2, and for the 581 to 850
UF range 61.59 m2. Types of allocated subsidy houses are determined by the
open market and include one and two story detached units, one and two story
row houses and, in the 400 to 850 UP range, also three and four story
apartments buildings. The 1981 survey indicates that most units purchased
were one-story detached houses.
8.        Contractors are reluctant t-o apply pre-fabrication or site
pre-fabrication techniques due to the heavy investments required in a
period of strong fluctuations ;n the housing market.
Cost for land, Site Development, and Housing Construction
9.        The cost accounting system of turn-key contract for the purchase
of social housing by MINVU does not provide information regarding unit
costs for land, site development and housing construction. Under special
bidding conditions, contractors quote a price for the finished product
including all costs. It is estimated that the cost of a 100 n2 developed



- 31 -
ANNEX 4
Attachment
Page 3 of 8
lot is about 60 UP, or 1/4 to 1/3 of the housing unit. For the ASP, MINVU
uses an appraisal manual which sets up a procedure for determining whether
the dwelling unit falls within the two different ranges subject to
subsidy. -NINVU correctly' assumes that the highly competitive systems
presently in operation guarantee low unit cost and efficiency.
10.       Unit costs for every building component are analyzed system-
atically by several private companies and published every two months bIy
them. MINVU also publishes by-monthly a separate list of building material
costs. Finally, the chamber of construction of Chile keeps a permanent
record of all costs related to building and publishes a monthly statistical
bulletin with relevant information to the builders.
Social Housing Program: Lump Sum Contract
11.       ?or the production of social housing, MINVU contracts with the
private sector not only the construction, but also assigns to them the task
of using the best available technology and entrepreneurial capacity for
low-coet housing construction. Conditions usually include the general
location of the required housing and that the development has to meet
certain standards and specifications.
12.       MINVU has been one of the largest urban land owners and has in
recent years been supplying most of the land for the SHP. The large amount
of land in the hands of MINVU is the result of the urban land policy of
previous governments. Officials at the Ministry consider that the price of
unserviced land has been oscillating within reasonable limits and XINNU
will continue to offer land for different projects promoted by it. The
bidder on any particular bid is not required to use the land that has been
offered by the Ministry and can substitute the location within the
neighborhood. To avoid land acquisition delays, almost all bidders usually
accept the preselected sites.
13.       Only contractors who are registered with XINVU and meet
predetermined standards can participate in biddings for public supported
programs. Once a project is chosen following the pre-established selection
procedures and a recommendation for contract award is made, MINVU's
operating authority (SERVIU) produces a resolution ratifying the minutes of
the committee, accepting the tender and ordering the contracting.
14;       The next step is the signing of a pledge-of-sale contract
(contrato de promesa de venta) where the bidder promises to sell to SERVIU
a given number of housing units at a fixed price. The bidder, as the
promising seller (prometiente vendedor), is obligated to subdivide and
improve the land and to build the dwelling units and ancillary facilities
within a given time and in accordance with the bidding conditions and the
particular project.
15.       The dwellings are to be built on land owned or to be bought by
the promising seller with his own financing or with proper credits of



- 32 -
ANNEX 4
Attachment
Page 4 of 8
loans.  If the land belongs to a third person, that person also becomes a
party to the pledge of sale contract and must authorize the execution of
the works on his land while the formal transfer of ownership of the land to
the builder takes place. The builder needs to become the legal owner of
the land at least 30 days prior to delivery of the works.
16.       The final step is the registration of the title in the registry
of deeds (Inscripcion de Dominio ante el Conservador de Bienes Raices) in
the name of SERVIU. The builder executes the works in conformity with the
bidding conditions, with strict adherence to the project specifications and
other terms of reference of the competitive bidding.  The local SERVIU
supervises the works and the builder is obligated to cooperate whenever
necessary. SERVIU supervision3/ does not free the builder from any of the
obligations and responsibilities as the builder-contractor in conformity
with the Civil Code (art. 2003) and the General Law. In order to proceed
to the final acceptance of the works, SERVIU verifies that they have been
built with strict adherence to the project, technical specifications and
other terms of reference of the competitive bidding, that they are
completely finished and habitable, and that the certificates of compliance
from the utility companies and the local authorities have been issued.
Evaluation and Selection of Projects Under SHP
17.       The purchase of social housing by the Ministry under the turn-
key contract system is governed by Dezreto 1292, and its subsequent
revisions. The above decree regulates the general administrative and
special bidding conditions applicable to each individual project.
Representatives of   professional societies (architectural and
engineering), civil builders, and the Chamber of Construction are invited
to observe the proceedings.
18.       Special bidding conditions are published in the announcement for
each case and include details for the specific bid, minimum number of
dwelling units required, location, site development standards, dwelling
types, minimum and maximum building areas, preferred building materials,
required soil analysis, water, sewer, electricity and gas installation,
guarantees required, form of presentation of the tender offer and selection
procedures. The announcement is published twice in a local newspaper and
in the official journal (Diario Oficial).  The special bidding conditions
follow standards used by most well-administered government institutions in
other Latin America countries. Main differences refer to the special
conditions of each turn key contract.
19.       MINVU has established a method of evaluation (metodode
evaluacion) for final project selection. Each offer is graded on its
technical qualities and the number of housing solutions offered. For
objectivity, the grading system is based on numerical value scales and a
series of specific standards.
3/ Periodic site inspections.



- 33 -
ANNEX 4
Attachment
Page 5 of 8
20.       Forms containing detailed instructions to guide the application
of the method are public. The bidding conditions and evaluation method
used by the Ministry provide a guarantee of objectivity in the selection of
projects. This system is considered to be fair and it is highly regarded
by the private building industry.
Allocated Subsidy Program
21.       The Ministry, following a pre-established procedure, selects the
applicants entitled to the subsidy and publishes the results with all the
pertinent information about the applicants, type of dwelling, price,
location, etc. The private builders, using the above information as a
detailed market survey, contact individual or collective (cooperatives)
holders of subsidy allocations in order to sell to them or to offer to
build for them the type of home they are interested in buying. In this
way, the private sector has become involved in the design, production, and
sale of housing to the lower-middle income groups.
22.       Holders of subsidy awards must request MINVU to appraise the
property they intend to buy, and in the event that the certificate of
appraisal valuation falls within the price range of the award, the
allocated subsidy can be used to pay part of the dwelling unit. The rest
is paid with individual savings of the beneficiary and any balance with a
mortgage credit.
Appraisal for Houses Under ASP
23.       According to the decree regulating the system of housing subsidy
passed in 1978 (Sistema de Subsidio Habitacional, D.S. 188, V. y U.), the
amount of the subsidy is directly related to the value of the appraisal
(valor de la tasacion) of the dwelling as determined by the local SERVIU.
Consequently, the fundamental requisite of the appraisal model has to be
objectivity so that irrespective of who applies it and where it is applied,
the results are basically the same. The Manual of Appraisal prepared by
MINVU allows for the appraisal of the dwelling unit at the project level so
that the builder can have the assurance that units to be built will be
eligible for the allocated subsidy. Since the amount of the subsidy is
the same throughout the country, the appraisal is made with equal unit
values to avoid favoring housing standards of some regions with respect to
others wherever constructions costs are different.
24.       The mentioned Manual has four parts plus an annex.  The first
part contains a general introduction explaining the origin and concept of
appraisal, the different modes and characteristics and basic operating
instructions for the user. The second part refers to land appraisal, the
third to the appraisal of new buildings, and the fourth defines the
procedure applied to old buildings. The annex contains instructions for



-34 -
ANNEX 4
Attachment
Page 6 of 8
the appraiser and tables and forms. Land or sites are appraised at market
value by comparing similar sites. To determine similarity, factors such as
type of neighborhood, quality,' utilities, community facilities and physical
characteristics are used. The manual contains c.-iteria to determine
correction factors with respect to location, form, street type, topography,
etc. There are special instructions and criteria to determine land cost in
the case of multifamily buildings and condominiums.
25.       Appraisal of new dwellings is made at replacement cost.  The
system first determines the price of the structure and then specifies
variables for different quality of finishing and details and installations
to obtain a total cost. The price of the structure is fixed by a table
that is applicable to all regions in UP per square meter. To this value
the appraiser adds a percentage for each item related to finishing and
installations. These percentages are factored according to instructions
and criteria given by the manual, using the prepared forms. Application of
the system results in a value per square meter expressed in UF and when
multiplied by the total built-up area of the dwelling, the total cost in
UF. In the case of old buildings, replacement value is affected by a
coefficient of depreciation.
26.       The manual includes all the pertinent information required by
officials of SERVIU to carry out the appraisal procedure objectively. It
allows for the appraisal of new housing in the project stage using an easy
and rapid process that can be applied to any region of the country.
contracting Firms - Registration by Activity, Category and Region
27.       MINVU has a Registry of Contractors (Registro Nacional de
Contratistas) and only those registered in good standing can carry out work
or provide goods to the Ministry or anyone of the operating authorities.
The Registry operates nationally; it is decentralized in the local SERVIUs
but once the inscription is ratified by the head office in Santiago, it is
valid country wide. There are specific regulations governing the
Registry. The contractor can register for one or more contracting
activities: building, site development, services and industrial
buildings. Both natural persons and juridical ones can register. To
register for any one of the activities the interested party has to show
proof .of academic record, licence to practice and relevant experience.
Foreign enterprises must document registration requirements through
appropriatelT notarized documentation.
28.       There has also to be proof of experience in similar work credited
with a certificate given by the client. The cer~tificate must indicate the
degree of compliance with all the contractual obligations. The contractors
are classified by categories depending on capital and experience. They are
also given credits or penalties based on performance. There are about
2,000 registered contractors, of which less than ten are foreign.



- 35 -
ANNEX 4
~' Attachment
Page 7 of 8
29.       The system used by the Ministry for prior classification of all
contractors and further control of their activities (all at the national
and local levels), properly protects the interests of the housing sector
and of the consumer.
Economies of Construction Techniques
30.       The competitive contract system used in the SHP "turn-key"
contract guarantees the use of economical construction techniquies. The
product has to be efficiently produced and meet the basic requiioments
established in the guidelines. The system of publishing the results of
each bid for subsidized housing provides interested builders with enough
information to compete for clients and ta maximimze economies of scale.
Builders are trying to rationalize building techniques and the use of
building materials and have undoubtedly reached a high degree of
efficiency. The building industry in Chile is highly developed compared to
other countries with similar population. The private sector is well
advanced in terms of qualified professionals, production of building
materials, standardization, building techniques, qualified workers and
competent entrepreneurs.
Role of the Land Developer
31.       In Chile the role of the land developer (land purchasing, site
devLlopment and sale of lots to individuals and builders) in lovwe: and
middle income family housing is practically non-existent. The private
sector claims there is no real demand for such a service under present
conditions. For middle and high cost housing, the land developers have
traditionally provided developed lots as in other Latin America countries.
According to the Ordenanza General de Con3trucciones y Urbanizacion,
building lots cannot be sold until they are provided with all
infrastructure requirements: utilities, paved streets and access roads to
the site. This provision is strictly enforced.
Construction Financing and Concerns Related to Coordination with
Regulatory Agencies
32.       Construction financing has been granted by MINVU in recent years
for up to 80% of the building cost. The interest rate charged by IINVU is
about one to one half of one percent lower than that charged by commercial
banks. But contractors have to secure the financing with a Bank
guarantee. This type of financing is considered an advance on the purchase
price of the dwelling unit and allows builders to secure the building
materials at lower costs at the beginning of the construction. This is an
added incentive to attract qualified contractors.
33.       The services that have to be provided by the builder under the
present turn-key contract for social housing have effectively transferred
to him all responsibilities for coordination with regulatory agencies, most

of which were previously taken care by the operating agencies of NINVU.
These include preliminary consultations on land uubdivision, utilities and
design work required prior toqsubmitting the bid. Once the contract has
been awarded, the contractor must obtain subdivision and building permits,
and be subject to control and monitoring at different stages of the work.
Finally, the finished product must pass inspections to establish compliance
with all local regulations and standards.
34.       Builders have stated that more progress can be made in expediting
the processing of papers, reducing the number of agencies involved and the
time periods to carry out each activity, including registration of titles
and mortgages in the registry of deeds.
35.       The activities of consultati6n with the municipalities, obtaining
permits and eubmission to supervision and control are judged to be no more
time consuming in Chile than in countries such as Colombia, Venezuela,
Ecuador and Costa Rica.

and Technical Assistance
I.    Consulting Services Related to Housing Sector
(a) Update studies on housing needs and effective demand, and
identify supply alternatives without subsidy content and
mechanisms and incentives required to foster a robust rental
market. Supply alternatives should also consider the

contracting housing on large scale and selling them into the
market with a view to minimize the subsidy, and (iii) giving
any special emphasis to regional needs.
(b) Review of management practices related to the MINVU mortgage
portfolio and establishment of an Action Program to
progressively increase the yield of the portfolio.
(c) Examination of indebtedness capacity considering the housing
solutions offered by the public sector and different
-socio-economic conditions.
(d) Review of measures which would allow greater efficiency in
the timing and the cost of administrative procedures under
NIBNU's programs.
(e) Review the measures required to improve the effectiveness of
recourse mechanism by home owners to correct construction
deficiencies.
II. Services Related to Urban Sector
(a)  Review the interrelationship between urban transport and
urban development.
(b) Review of training requirements of municipal officials in
the field of urban development and provision of actual
training.
III. Services Related to Mortgage Finance
(a) Review of determinants of commercial bank spreads and means
to lower them in mortgage finance.
