    planning capabilities and stimulating competition and\n            private sector involvement. The project includes high\n            priority investments, sector reforms and institutional\n            action plans. The major investments include the following:\n            (i) roads: a highway replacement program; a time slice of\n            the road maintenance and rehabilitation program; and a\n            departmental gravel roads program; (ii) ports: dike\n            construction; upgrading of port utilities; dredging; boat\n            repair facilities, and expansion of berthing facilities; and\n            (iii) technical assistance and training to support the\n            implementation of the action plans. The action plans include\n            measures to: (i) strengthen transport planning and adjust\n            sector policies; (ii) improve road management practices; and\n            (iii) increase port operating efficiency."}, "docdt": "1988-11-23T00:00:00Z"}
