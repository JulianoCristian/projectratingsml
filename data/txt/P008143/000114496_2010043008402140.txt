            Re:   URUGUAY, Loan 3021-UR, Transport Project I

Dear Mr. Minister:
I refer to the Loan Agreement for the above referenced Project between the
Republica Oriental del Uruguay (the Borrower) and the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) dated April 6, 1989, as amended.
     Following the receipt of Minister de Posadas' letter to Mr. Husain of
March 27, 1992, I am pleased to inform you that the Bank agrees to further
amend the Loan Agreement to broaden the scope of activities in the roads and
ports subsectors which can be supported by the Loan.  The Bank proposes to
amend the Loan Agreement as follows:
1.    Sections 3.01 (a), 3.03 and 4.01 (a) are amended by replacing the
      expression "Parts A, B.3, B.4 and C, other than C.4," thereof, by the
      expression "Parts A, B.3, B.4, (other than C.4) and D".
2.    The table set forth in paragraph 1 of Schedule I to the Loan
      Agreement is amended as provided in the attachment to this letter.
3.    Schedule 2 is amended by adding a new "Part D" of the Project which
      shall read:
      "Part D: Studies
      Studies on alternative options of proposed transport links between
      Argentina and Uruguay."
4.    Paragraph 1 (a) of Schedule 4 is amended by adding after "6 (b),",the
      category "6 (c)".
5.    Section II of Schedule 5 is amended by replacing the expression
      "Parts A, B.2, B.3, B.4 and C of the Project, other than C.4," in the
      second line thereof, by the expression "Parts A, B.3, B.4, C (other
      than C.4) and D of the Project,".
     The foregoing Amendment shall become effective upon receipt by the Bank
of a copy of this letter confirmed by you, as the authorized representative
of the Borrower.
     Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing by signing the
enclosed copy of this letter and returning it to us.
     Because of their interest in this matter, I am sending copies of this
letter to Dr. De Posadas, Ing. Cat and Messrs. Bouer, Federico and Serrato.
                             Sincerely yours,
