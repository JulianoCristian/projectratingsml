satisfactory, and the performance of the Bank and\n            the Borrower were also rated satisfactory. Some of the\n            lessons learned from the project are: 1) mobilizing support\n            from affected parties within a given institutional structure\n            is critical to ensure the effectiveness of reforms. The\n            reforms in Ministry of Transport and Public Works (MTOP) and\n            National Port Administration (ANP) required restructuring of\n            the management, while maintaining frequent contacts with key\n            actors, obtaining timely feedback, and producing early\n            results. Potential complaints from ANP employees were\n            avoided through well-designed social compensation packages.\n            The early success in port reforms was essential to gain\n            commitment for the more difficult reform agenda in the roads\n            sector. National Directorate for Roads (DNV) substantially\n            reduced personnel through outsourcing road maintenance\n            activities to micro enterprises started by former staff; 2)\n            optimizing the transportation system is the main rationale\n            for a multimodal approach. Elimination of the railways\n            component at project appraisal deprived the project from\n            addressing issues common to all transport sub-sectors, while\n            the multimodal approach adopted brought unnecessary\n            complexities to project management, implementation and\n            supervision. Before entering into a complex multimodal\n            project, the merits of such approach should be carefully\n            assessed against the risk of having certain components lag\n            due to ineffective modal coordination; and 3) although these\n            activities are now all standard practice, the following\n            elements would have facilitated project implementation: (i)\n            a project launch exercise to build consensus in the early\n            stages of implementation; (ii) an operational manual to\n            guide the executing agency; (iii) performance indicators;\n            (iv) training of Borrower staff in e Bank's\n            procurement, audit, and disbursement policies and\n            procedures; and (v) incorporating stakeholder participation\n            in project design."}, "docdt": "1998-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
