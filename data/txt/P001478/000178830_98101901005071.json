The\n            Bank's performance in project supervision was overall\n            very satisfactory, and made relatively straightforward by\n            the thorough preparation of the project, the competence of\n            the Director General of Mangoro Forest Company\n            (FANALAMANGA), as well as good understanding and\n            collaboration between the Bank and project staff. The Bank\n            also showed open mindedness and flexibility in several cases\n            of problem resolution mentioned in the report, including the\n            procurement of fertilizer under conditions of urgency, the\n            reorganization of the plantation layout, and the use of\n            earth balls rather than plastic tubes in the nurseries. One\n            fundamental question should be answered in conclusion to\n            this report: should a forestry project be undertaken with\n            uncertain information on the expected yields? It is the\n            mission's opinion that the risk of obtaining\n            disappointing yields can never be completely eliminated. The\n            appraisal mission, having noted the risk, could only rely on\n            the studies of many highly qualified foresters who worked in\n            the pre-project phases and showed that the project was worth\n            the risk. Therefore, with the information available the Bank\n            was accurate to undertake the project."}, "docdt": "1982-11-24T00:00:00Z"}
