PREAMBLE
Albania has made a request for an International Development Association (IDA) Credit to finance the Power Sector
Rehabilitation and Restructuring Project. The development objective of the project is to achieve significant improvement in the
operational effectiveness of the power sector through (a) implementation of electricity loss reduction measures; (b) enforcement of
billing, collection and siconnection policies; (c) introduction of electricity price rationalization measures; (d) priority investments to
improve system supply and reliability; and (e) initiation of regulatory strengthening and sector restructuring measures to improve
sector efficiency and establish the preconditions for competition and privatization.
The largest project component consists of rehabilitation and strengthening of the distribution and transmission systems in the
Durres, Elbasan and Kucova regions. These systems have frequent unscheduled outages and high technical losses because of
overloading and worn out equipment, and they have not benefited up to now from donor-financed investments.
The specific transmission and distribution components would be the following:
* Durres Region: development of a 20 kV distribution network in northwest Durres area and towards Gjiri Lalezit; construction
of a new 8 km 110 kV transmission line between Rashbull and Porto Romano; construction of a new 110/20 kV substation at
Porto Romano with an installed capacity of 2x25 MVA.
* Elbasan Region: development of a 20 kV distribution network in Kombinati I Drurit and the periphery of the city of Elbasan;
construction of a new 3 km double-circuit 110 kV line from the El-Fiber line to Kombinati I Drurit; construction of a new
1 10/20 kV substation at Kombinati I Drurit with an installed capacity of 2x25 MVA.
* Kucova Region: installation of a 20 kV distribution network in place of the existing 6 kV network in the city of Berat and its
surrounding area; construction of a new 10 km double-circuit 110 kV transmission line from the 110 kV Kucova-Uznove line
to Berat Substation; rehabilitation of 2 km of the existing 110 kV transmission line from Kucova to Uznove by changing the
cross-sectional area of the line from ACSR 95 mm2 to ACSR 240 mm2; installation of a new 110/20 kV substation in the city
of Berat with an installed capacity of 2x25 MVA.
