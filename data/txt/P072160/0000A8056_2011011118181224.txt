                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the project is to assist the Borrower to improve access, reliability and affordability of key utilities, through completion of the divestiture
                         program of key state-owned enterprises, and capacity building initiatives to strengthen the capacity of autonomous regulators and privatization agencies, and
                         facilitate entry of new operators in the deregulated sectors, and increase the competitiveness of Malagasy companies (as approved by the Board on November
                         14, 2002).

                         The political crisis and the ensuing non-replenishment of the project special account under OP/BP 7.30 have led to a standstill of the project's implementation from March 17, 2009 to
                         the project closing date of December 31, 2010.

                         Against that background both Project Development Objective (PDO) and overall Implementation progress (IP) rating are downgraded to Moderately Unsatisfactory. No activity has
                         resumed or been launched since March 2009. No progress towards PDO and IP achievements has been recorded so far.

                         For the record, in accordance with project restructuring of December 2007 the end-of-project date is December 31, 2009.
