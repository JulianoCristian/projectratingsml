I. Disbursement Profile
1.        Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1       Context at Appraisal
1.       Country context: Madagascar was one of the poorest countries in the world at the turn
of the century. In 2001, the country‘s gross domestic product (GDP) per capita at purchasing
power parity (PPP) was US$848; or 59 percent of the average value in Sub-Saharan Africa.1
Following Board approval of the Second Private Sector Development project (PSDP2) (or, the
Project), on August 28, 2001, the economy has mostly expanded, partly as a result of increased
exports of agricultural and garments products, debt service relief under the enhanced Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, and two major investments in the mining industry. 2 In
the past decade, the Malagasy economy stood up reasonably well to environmental and economic
shocks, such as devastating cyclones and deteriorating terms of trade, as well as currency
volatility. In 2002-2008, the country embarked on an ambitious reform path that brought
improvements in social, economic and governance indicators. However, the Malagasy economy
contracted in 2002 and 2009 due to political turmoil.

2.      Rationale for Bank assistance: The Project‘s interventions aimed to lock in earlier
achievements and to strengthen the reform process embarked upon by the country in the second
half of the 1990s. An earlier reform program, supported by the (first) Private Sector
Development and Capacity Building Project (PATESP, CR.2956, 1997-2002), encouraged
private sector development through changes in the legal business environment. Markets were
liberalized and some 50 companies privatized, including eight of the largest state-owned
enterprises (SOEs) and two financial institutions, and the Government of Madagascar (GOM)
established regulatory agencies before the transactions of the privatization process were
concluded. Hence, the Project was prepared and designed in a positive environment categorized
by expectations that the Second Private Sector Development Project would be able to capitalize
on the momentum enjoyed by the Private Sector Development and Capacity Building Project.

3.      The Project‘s interventions were designed to support the objectives of the Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) (16249-MAG), of January 17, 1997, which aimed to reduce poverty
through high growth and ―quantum leaps in investment‖. According to the Interim Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP), of November 28, 2000, economic performance was expected
to improve by completing the GOM‘s ongoing financial and economic reform program. It
included the implementation of a new legal framework that would promote transparent business
rules, private investment, and local enterprise development in sectors with high growth potential
such as tourism, mining, manufacturing, telecommunications and seafood. It also covered the
finalization of the privatization program and the expansion of infrastructure. The Project
supported these goals and aimed to improve efficiency and expansion of key infrastructure
services that were identified in the I-PRSP as the main constraints to potential sources of growth.

1.2       Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
4.     According to the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), the principal objective of the
project was ―to enable the Government of Madagascar to improve access, reliability, and
affordability of key utilities, including transport‖. The Development Credit Agreement (DCA)
dated October 5, 2001, was somewhat more comprehensive in definition and stated that the PDO
was ―to assist the Borrower to improve access, reliability and affordability of key utilities,
through completion of the divestiture program of key state-owned enterprises, and capacity
building initiatives to strengthen the capacity of autonomous regulators and privatization
agencies, and facilitate entry of new operators in the deregulated sectors.‖

5.      The Project was designed to achieve two specific goals. The first goal was to complete
the divestiture of four key state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and 30 small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) as well as to liberalize the agro-industry, air transport, energy, finance, and
telecommunications markets. This was meant to improve efficiency of the companies and create
opportunities for new private entry and investment. The second goal was to strengthen the
capacity of GOM to regulate privatized sectors. See Table 1 for the original key indicators to
assess the achievement of the development objectives.

1.3       Revised PDO and Key Outcome Indicators
6.      Shortly after the Project was approved by the Board of Directors on August 28, 2001, a
lengthy political crisis erupted that paralyzed the public sector, plunged the economy into
decline, and delayed Project effectiveness. Following the installation of a new Government and
upon its request to the World Bank, on October 22, 2002, the President of the World Bank called
for the Board of Executive Directors to approve several proposed changes to the World Bank
portfolio in the post-conflict environment, including the DCA of the Project, through the
approval of the Regional Vice President.3

7.       The Project‘s DCA was thus amended on November 12, 2002 to better reflect the
priorities of the new Government. The amendment led to Project effectiveness and was the actual
starting point for the Project as no disbursements had been made prior to the restructuring. The
Project Development Objective (PDO) was amended with a slight addition to the original PDO
with the final words in bold: ―to assist the Borrower to improve access, reliability and
affordability of key utilities, through completion of the divestiture program of key state-owned
enterprises, and capacity building initiatives to strengthen the capacity of autonomous
regulators and privatization agencies, and facilitate entry of new operators in the deregulated
sectors and increase the competitiveness of Malagasy companies‖. In addition, the outcome
indicator on ‗transport‘ was dropped from the Project at the restructuring mission and this change
was thereafter reflected in the second amendment to the DCA.

8.      On May 6, 2003, the Country Director and the Government agreed to amend the DCA a
second time with modifications to introduce miscellaneous changes to the project description, the
allocation of funds to credit components, and financial and institutional arrangements governing
project implementation. These amendments were not resubmitted to the Board but they followed

Directors in the fall of 2002.

1.4          Main Beneficiaries
9.       The PAD did not identify specific beneficiaries. The rationale was that the Project would
benefit the overall economy through increased competition, adoption of productivity enhancing
initiatives by the private sector, and investments boosting access and lowering prices of utility
services. The ceding of control of loss-making companies to the private sector was expected to
generate cost savings that could be reinvested to expand basic services. For the local private
sector, benefits were expected to be significant as the reforms would facilitate the development
of local entrepreneurship. By targeting backbone services, such as transport and telecoms, the
PAD explicitly assumed that the benefits of improved access and competitive rates would spill
over into other sectors, thereby giving rise to a significant multiplier effect. Simplified
procedures for enterprise registration, and easier and cheaper access to key business services,
would benefit entrepreneurship.

1.5          Original Components
10.     The PAD outlined three broad project components: (i) regulatory capacity building; (ii)
transaction implementation; and (iii) ‗new Private Sector Development (PSD) activities‘. These
project components are summarized below with a brief assessment of the causal linkages
between component activities and PDO outcomes.

      (i)       Regulatory Capacity Building
11.     The first component would strengthen the regulatory capacity of autonomous sector
regulators for air transport, petroleum and telecoms, and in particular: (i) improve their
efficiency in undertaking technical and economic regulation; and (ii) monitor environmental
hazards in compliance with national legislation, sector standards and World Bank Group (WBG)
policies. In addition, it would build in-house capacity of the Center for Facilitation of Enterprise
Creation (CFEC), and strengthen the insurance sector.

12.     From a causality perspective, strengthening regulatory capacity to enhance competition,
improve policy and monitor markets was an essential requirement in order to achieve the PDOs
of enhancing access, reliability and affordability of targeted utility sectors. It was also a key pre-
condition for a successful outcome from the privatization and reform program of public
enterprises. The CFEC was a worthwhile initiative to support market entry in the newly
liberalized and other sectors.

      (ii)      Transaction Implementation
13.     The second component would provide support for institutional capacity building, a local
ownership development scheme, and privatization implementation. First, it would strengthen the
Privatization Secretariat (STP) through technical assistance, including for environmental
screening and auditing, retraining through the Programme d'Appui Social et Economique pour la
Réinsertion Professionnelle (PASERP), and through arbitration. Second, it would help divest of
Privatization Trust Fund (PTF) shares to local investors, provide financial advisory services to
PTF to implement regulations and safeguards, hire a private fund manager to oversee and
manage the fund, create a registry for shares, explore the feasibility of developing mutual funds,
and launch a communications campaign. Third, it would support completion of the remaining


                                                  4
key companies and small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) of the ongoing privatization
program (telecoms, the main airports, sugar and cotton). It would also provide financing to assist
in the structuring and closing of the transactions, including legal advisory support to resolve land
and title issues pertaining to ownership transfers, and carry out environmental audits of select
companies.

14.     The successful implementation of the activities in this component was essential in
boosting competition, freeing up GOM time and resources wasted on mostly unproductive and/or
failing enterprises to be invested elsewhere, and in allowing for the restructuring of these
businesses. By attacking some of the vested interests, including between civil servants,
politicians and executives, and imperfect markets, the proposed activities were likely to reduce
inefficiencies and waste, boost competition, provide a fairer and more conducive investment
climate, and strengthen the Malagasy economy in the long-term.

      (iii)   Developing new PSD activities
15.     The third and final component would: (i) provide support to the operational set up and
efficient development of a center (OMPE) created to coordinate activities of micro and small
enterprises (MSE); and (ii) develop strategies to support the implementation of activities
identified in the I-PRSP. In addition, it would provide advisory services to develop a strategy to
promote MSEs and use OMPE to allow MSEs to access market information and technology. It
was also expected to help jump-start the development of priority sectors identified by GOM
using pilot projects, including by assisting GOM in developing new PSD strategies, and provide
assistance to new local business start-ups.

16.     The causal link between the activities in this third component and in facilitating entry of
new operators in the deregulated sectors—the relevant part of the PDO—was clear. Yet the
anticipated reduction of transaction and information costs would have benefited in particular
MSEs. The large investments and expertise generally required to enter utility markets indicate
that the activities in component 3 were insufficient to have any significant contribution to
achieving the PDO.

17.      In summary, successful implementation of the activities would have improved access and
reliability to services critical in achieving higher growth (CAS objective). 4 It is also highly likely
that they would have helped reduce poverty through private sector-led growth (CAS goal) in the
long-term. The link to affordability was not obvious, however. Effective regulation—a high
priority in the PAD—would help alleviate some of the potentially negative effects and so would
the training program aimed at facilitating the transfer of retrenched workers into new productive
activities. The activities and selected outputs are therefore likely to have had a positive impact on
achieving some of the PDO outcomes, as analyzed in detail below. Causality for the
interventions of the transport component and its associated outcome indicators were not
convincing given the limited investment and technical assistance interventions as well as
ambitious price reduction targets (see Table 1 for indicators and Annex 1 for budget allocation).
This component was cancelled before implementation begun; thus it is not explored in this
report.

 1.6       Revised Components
 18.     The three headline components remained unchanged during the course of the Project.
 However, modifications were made to sub-components: some were dropped and others added as
 the management team sought to adjust the project design to reflect evolving political and
 economic priorities, simplify a comprehensive and complex undertaking, and incorporate new
 development tools that were perceived as effective means to achieve the objectives. The
 restructuring in November 2002 was initiated by a formal letter sent by the President of the
 World Bank in which he requested approval for a number of modifications, as noted in the
 previous section. These and some other modifications were then recorded in the amended DCA
 of May 2003. The amendment to the DCA at the mid-term review in 2005 was minor and added
 two sub-components to the third component. Table 2 presents and explains the changes made to
 individual subcomponents during the course of the Project. Table 3 then presents a summary of
 the three components and the changes in their sub-components.

2.           Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1          Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

20.     The background analysis was sound, lessons learned from the first project were stressed
in project design, private sector consultations were organized and recorded, and the rationale for
the Bank‘s intervention was clear. The Government had prior to project design developed a
strategic vision for private sector development as part of its National Support Program for the
Private Sector. Project preparation and design also benefitted from the extensive expertise
developed in the PATESP Project that was approved by the Board on May 29, 1997, which
closed on December 31, 2002.6 The Project focused on deepening the market deregulation and
divestiture activities that were undertaken in PATESP. Concerns and priorities were well
identified, and several analytical reports underpinned the project, including on environmental
safeguard issues.7 The volatile political context and the fragility of local institutions were
prominently acknowledged in the PAD as political turmoil had affected PATESP.

21.     The PAD stressed the importance of ensuring improved transparency and increased local
participation in the privatization process but also highlighted the significant risk associated with
political instability and limited capacity of local institutions. The PAD dedicated significant
attention to improving transparency in the reform process: for example by proposing separation
of the policy-making and regulatory functions of public agencies, by providing modern
management information systems, by moving toward financial autonomy of the regulatory
agencies, and by applying best practices in the privatization process. The Project also intended to
scale up local private participation in the divestiture program to make necessary reforms
palatable to a public audience who too often associated privatization with foreign takeovers of
domestic assets. It proposed that local investors would be invited to bid in a joint venture with
foreign equity and technical partners. It also aimed at establishing procedures for distributing
shares or mutual funds which would contain a stipulated share of each divested firm. Finally, it
would facilitate the expansion of indigenous local firms, in particular micro-enterprises which
would be provided start-up services. These initiatives were taken amid great political uncertainty
and with acknowledged weaknesses in governance.

                                                                 9
22.     The high complexity and comprehensive scope of the Project coupled with its sensitive
nature required a high level of government commitment and collaboration between several
public institutions. The project was highly demanding of the Government and the
implementation team and it came at a high political cost. The privatization agenda was unpopular
among many stakeholders and the Government was concerned about the loss of labor. The
incumbent Government was committed at least on paper at the time of project preparation and
project design but reform pressure was also applied by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
through its programs. Project documentation highlighted the high risk associated with reform
fatigue. Key issues such as political fragility, political economy concerns, and limited
government capacity to build solid institutions within tight deadlines were indicators that the
risks were high. The significant complexity of the Project could have been reduced if the new
PSD activities component had been left out at the design stage and left aside for another Project
that focused on SME support. The project did not include external partners and co-financiers
outside of GOM and the attention to environmental and social safeguards was high.

23.      The PDO of improving access, reliability and affordability of key utilities was highly
relevant for private sector development, investment promotion and shared growth. The
regulatory capacity building and privatization components were both essential building blocks in
GOM‘s development agenda. Market liberalization, competition and effective regulation are
necessary components to improve market performance. By focusing on key factor markets
(finance, telecoms, transport) as well as inefficient monopolies (airports, cotton, sugar), GOM
would have been well placed to achieve its development objectives if reforms were properly
implemented with attention to competition and effective regulation. Significant progress had
already been made in the 1990s, particularly through the PATESP project, to prepare and start
the liberalization process. Thus, the main objective was consistent with the prevailing economic
priorities of the Government.

24.      The ‗new PSD activities‘ component was not closely associated with the PDO before it
was restructured in November 2002. The title of the third component, ‗New PSD Activities‘, was
somewhat misleading: ‗SME promotion‘ could have been more appropriate. One of the three
sub-components—‗New strategies in priority sectors identified by Government‘—for ‗New PSD
Activities‘ was not defined at the start. While the establishment of the one stop shop (GUIDE)
was a targeted and practical sub-component that benefited all prospective entrepreneurs, the aim
to train only ten local startups was largely irrelevant and the aim to support future priority sectors
of the Government offered flexibility but limited guidance to the team. While this added
flexibility to adapt part of the Project to GOM‘s evolving agenda may have been appreciated by
the client, this component that performed particularly poorly as the new activities were weak
either in design or implementation. The initial resources allocated for the third component were
less than 6 percent of total resources. In addition, the limited resource allocation (US$0.28
million) for the transport sub-component covering some narrow technical assistance
interventions was unlikely to achieve the ambitious outcome indicators on transport prices. In
transport, it would also have been difficult to determine causality between identified
interventions and the two outcome indicators (Table 1).




                                                 10
25.     Some targets should have been more specific and performance indicators more
comprehensive. The combined targets of improving access, lowering prices and improving
quality/reliability were ambitious despite the lack of quality and poor access as well as relatively
high prices of services. While the experiences from many other countries show that access and
quality often improve substantially as a result of market liberalization, absolute price changes are
often marginal. Large improvements in access, choice, and quality raise the utility for
consumers. Competition facilitates price segmentation which by extension can result in both
lower and higher prices depending on the service in question. Price is also closely related to
taxation as illustrated in the petroleum sector. Potential efficiency gains can therefore be
captured by increased rents and increased taxes can neutralize any efficiency gains and even
raise the overall price. The retail price is therefore an imperfect target. There was furthermore no
performance indicator defined for reliability. In addition, the outcome indicator of significantly
increasing private investment in targeted sectors was not a useful measurement of the successful
reforms because political uncertainty scared off investors for years following each crisis.

26.     Proactive measures to ensure competitive markets could have been more prominent in
project design. Market liberalization and privatization do not necessarily ensure competitive
markets. Proper phasing and sequencing of reform measures are critical and so is the autonomy
of regulatory bodies. The existing literature on market liberalization does pay much attention to
ensuring a healthy dose of competition in order to boost reliability and affordability. While an
important body of this literature was developed in the years subsequent to project launch, the
project could have highlighted these issues more upfront in the design. The PAD mentioned
competition as a byproduct resulting from a strengthened regulator; however, ensuring autonomy
was arguably just as important as building technical expertise in order to induce a higher level of
market competition. In addition, the design of the privatization process could have promoted the
breakup of national monopolies into two or more providers in order to stimulate competition.
Transparency clauses could have conditioned transaction support: openness and simplicity would
have been the key principles in an approach that particularly stressed competitive markets. Clear
rules and punishments would have been established. Price caps could have been considered for
some sectors. These types of initiatives are often necessary but not sufficient to promote
competition.

2.2    Implementation

27.     Political developments beyond the control of the Project team had serious implications
for the Project. Project implementation was severely delayed at the start due to the unraveling of
a political crisis that paralyzed the Government and the civil service; and at the end due to a
similar political crisis. In December 2001, shortly after the Project was approved by the Board of
Directors and the signing of the Credit Agreement, the incumbent President (Didier Ratsiraka)
and his main opponent (Marc Ravalomanana) both claimed victory in the presidential elections.
In April 2002, after months of sporadic violence and considerable economic disruption, the High
Constitutional Court pronounced Ravalomanana as President following a recount of votes. In
July 2002, Ratsiraka left the country and Ravalomanana effectively gained control of power. The
new political context and harsh economic environment left the new Government unwilling to
implement painful new reforms and divest politically sensitive enterprises.



                                                11
28.     In November 2002, soon after the new cabinet had been installed, the country project
portfolio was restructured, including the Project, to better reflect the priorities of the new
administration. This was a necessary step to enhance Project ownership in the new
administration. Significant reallocation of funds was made and some components were dropped
and others introduced. The outcome was a project that better responded to the priorities in the
aftermath of the crisis with a less ambitious agenda on privatization and a more ambitious
agenda on rebuilding the private sector and promoting business. At the time, these initiatives
must have been regarded as rather drastic but it would turn out that these amendments did not go
far enough to reflect the evolving priorities of the new administration. In particular the
Government‘s commitment to the privatization agenda was weak.

29.     The supervision reports reveal a sense of frustration of progress: on privatization in
general and on New PSD Activities in particular. The project faced significant challenges in
building new institutions such as the One Stop Shop for Investment and Business Development
(GUIDE) and CAPE (see Annex 2, component 3); in strengthening the existing implementation
units; and in creating an environment conducive to collaboration between public agencies. The
willingness by the Government to take difficult decisions was often lacking. The new
Government hesitated over further privatization and supervision records raise questions of
ownership in this process. No doubt, the privatization of enterprises took longer than anticipated
and Madagascar Airports (Aéroports de Madagascar, ADEMA), Madagascar Power and Water
Company (Jiro Sy Rano Malagasy, JIRAMA) and Madagascar Sugar Industry (Siramamy
Malagasy, SIRAMA) were never privatized. The fact that several of the public enterprises were
poorly managed did not help. For example, SIRAMA was already bankrupt, many companies did
not have accounts, environmental audits had to be done, assets identified and recorded, etc. In
addition, a combination of insufficiently allocated counterpart funding and bureaucratic
procurement procedures adopted by the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) led to significant
arrears that slowed down progress as contractors and consultants faced great uncertainty about
remuneration. The economic crisis left the Government short of funds and the International
Development Association (IDA) credit was therefore increased to 100 percent.

30.      To regain momentum, the Client and the World Bank developed a short-term action plan
to closely monitor progress and new staff was recruited to accelerate implementation. The results
achieved under this plan in six months were to decide the future of the Project and in December
2003, the supervision team concluded that this initiative had brought significant improvements.
The supervision reports indicate that several experts were hired to help alleviate shortages of
manpower and guidance was provided in action plans, including several recommendations to
establish frequent meetings and bring all parties to the table. The initiatives to enhance the
institutional capacity of the Privatization Secretariat (Secrétariat Technique à la Privatisation,
STP) in the fall of 2003—following resignations of key staff members transferred from PATESP
to PSDP2 due to salary reductions—were decisive to complete the privatization of the Cotton
Company (Hasy Malagasy, HASYMA) and the Telephone Company (Telecom Malagasy,
TELMA). A program of staff training in privatization and public-private partnerships (PPPs) was
launched and study tours organized with focus on practical aspects of implementing programs
and divestiture. The capacity building activities at STP was later key for the success of the public
enterprise reform program.

31.     Project implementation was impeded by the organizational structure during the first half
of the Project. The initial project management structure could have been more supportive to
effectively address the multitude of challenges that the complex project posed to the team. The
Government official who was appointed head of the Implementation Agency (or Unité de
Coordination du Projet, UCP) could have been more proactive and results oriented (PIU = UCP
+ STP + PSD units). The first professional who was hired to be in charge of the crucial
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activities did not have the training and experience for the role.
The two advisory and implementation units—STP for components 1-2 and the PSD unit for
component 3—that the UCP oversaw did not communicate and coordinate as necessary (see
Figure 2). STP, a ministry unit, was more responsive to the Ministry of Finance and Budget than
to the head of PIU. It worked closely with the ministries in charge of the state-owned enterprises
(SOEs) during divestiture preparation. The PSD unit—an implementation unit created inside the
Project—was more responsive to the Ministry of Economy and Industry (previously Ministry of
Industry, Trade and Private Sector Development) than UCP. This organizational structure was
implemented to strengthen the commitment of various ministries but it also imposed high
coordination costs, as highlighted in the government Report in Annex 7.

32.      The PIU was initially over staffed and bureaucratic and the organization was drastically
restructured to a slimmer and more efficient implementation unit in June 2006. Each unit (UCP,
STP, PSD) in the PIU had its own procurement and accounting team; and the PIU counted 69
staff on renewable one-year contracts by the end of 2005. Many of these staff members were
government officials transferred to the new institutions originally hosted under the PIU umbrella.
They were not paid by the PIU and performed public services, such as issuing work permits and
business licenses at the GUIDE. This arrangement was meant to offer flexibility in future staff
decisions. While the supervision records highlight organizational weaknesses, and there was
some trimming of unnecessary staff that was transferred from PATESP to PSDP2 and more
reliance was transferred to World Bank staff, decisive action to correct the situation would take
until early 2006. As the Project was heading towards closing in December 2005, and there was
significant uncertainty whether the Project would be extended or not, some high-level officials
left the PIU, including the head of UCP. Many staff members also left as a natural result of the
completion of sub-components such as the Support Committee for the Enterprise Relaunch Pilot
(Comité d‘Appui au Pilotage de la Relance de l‘Entreprise, CAPE) (11 staff) and GUIDE (13
staff). The PSD unit (AGEX B in Figure 2) was removed from the organizational chart and the
government-sponsored civil servants at UCP were transferred back to the Ministry of Finance
and Budget. The team took this opportunity to significantly restructure the organization, which
resulted in a much slimmer organization (see Figure 2). Several sub-components in the PSD unit
were also removed and none of the Project staff associated with this unit had their contracts
renewed. The number of staff was thus cut from 69 to 11.

33.     The mid-term review was used to add two new sub-components and provide advice on
how to reactivate some non-performing sub-components. It offered an opportunity to the Project
to disassociate itself from some sub-components that were not progressing and focus support on
those that were more promising. However, no sub-component was removed and the opportunity
to cut losses was not seized at this time. Instead, the supervision records of the mission following
the mid-term review (January 2006) were more candid, emphasizing disappointments and lack of
achievements, and suggesting more drastic measures to address existing problems. For example,
the Privatization Trust Fund (PTF) was a non-performing sub-component and the supervision
mission in January 2006 recommended dropping this sub-component from the project. The same
held for the privatization of SIRAMA. It also recommended GOM to cancel the contract with the
Export Processing Zone (EPZ) property developer (GETIM) given a number of irregularities and
weaknesses in performance (see Annex 2, component 3). It advised that EDBM would take over
GUIDE and implicitly adopt the role of CAPE, which had exhausted its effort in enhancing
public private dialogue.

34.      The most recent political crisis and the ensuing non-replenishment of the project special
account under OP/BP 7.30 led to a standstill of the project‘s implementation from March 17,
2009, to the project closing date of December 31, 2010. This development led to a freeze of most
Project activities and necessary action to conclude ongoing initiatives could not be taken. During
this crisis, the country was suspended by the African Union (AU, then the Organisation of
African Unity) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC). Another outcome
was that as of January 1, 2010, Madagascar is no longer designated as beneficiary of U.S. trade
preferences offered in the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). 8 The country‘s
eligibility of AGOA preferences, starting October 2000, helped it establish a significant textiles
and clothing sector—export processing zone (EPZ) exports were worth US$0.82 billion in 2008
(EIU, 2010)—that has been seriously damaged in the last two years. As of April 2011, the
international community including several governments, bilateral and multilateral donors still
does not recognize the current de facto Government (i.e. Haute Autorité de la Transition).

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

35.     The design of the M&E framework should have been better tailored to the PDO and to
existing baseline data sources. While performance in the telecom sector was adequately
measured, outcome indicators for other sectors were left out from the M&E framework,
including the petroleum sector. To measure progress on access, reliability and affordability of
key utility services, a more comprehensive set of indicators would have been required and more
independent data collection would have been necessary. The restructuring in November 2002
partly addressed this issue as a number of new performance indicators were added to the
monitoring framework and others modified. The PIU also modified the M&E framework to keep
it more relevant and easier to monitor. The M&E framework remained weak, however, and the
supervision teams struggled with the M&E function. Most aide-memoires of supervision
missions did not measure performance according to the pre-defined performance indicators.

36.      The M&E framework could have been used more extensively during the first half of the
Project. Data for several of the key project indicators (KPIs) were not systematically collected,
partly due to the fact that they were not easily accessible in standard databases. For example, one
of the KPIs was sector specific inflows of private investment. While these variables are reported
in central World Bank databases and by the Central Bank, the information is not available for all
years and it is particularly lacking for Madagascar. Many KPIs were output indicators and to
measure progress on competitiveness, the project could have made more use of indicators on
enterprise creation and private sector productivity. The first person who was hired for the M&E
activities had no prior experience or training in monitoring or evaluation. The M&E function
suffered as a result. It was not until a new person was recruited in the mid-term of the Project
that the PIU became more proactive in collecting data and monitoring project performance
according to the indicators. But it was then too late to retrieve some of the historical data and the
complexity of some of the existing indicators and a general lack of data left the M&E function
underutilized.

2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

37.     The respect of safeguard issues is rated satisfactory. The Project was originally rated as
environmental category B (partial assessment). Three main provisions were incorporated in
Project design to ensure compliance with safeguards. First, the Project would prepare
environmental partial and full audits for listed candidates. Second, the project would offer
capacity building to the privatization agency and the national environmental agency. Third, the
project would support public involvement through comprehensive consultations and a
communications campaign. Safeguard policies were deemed applicable only to environmental
assessment (OP 4.01, BP 4.01, GP 4.01). An environmental pre-audit was conducted for each
listed privatization candidate following a comprehensive consultation process.

38.     Environmental audits were conducted for ADEMA, HASYMA, SIRAMA and the
National Oil Company of Madagascar (Solitany Malagasy, SOLIMA) (post-audit) as planned in
project design. They were approved by World Bank teams with technical assessments provided
by the World Bank‘s Environment and Natural Resource Management Unit for the Africa
Region (AFTEN) and publicly discussed and disclosed. These environmental audits were very

                                                 15
large undertakings that recorded and assessed the situation in reports several hundred pages long.
For example, the SOLIMA report was 833 pages long not including addendums. In the
privatization of SOLIMA, which had by far the most critical environmental impact, the
environmental cleanup was assigned to the new private companies, in particular by Galana,
which was required to take care of the issues linked to the main pipeline and old refinery and this
was arguably a good solution.

39.     The PAD dedicated significant attention in assessing the client‘s procurement and
financial management capacity, and in providing recommendations to boost this capacity.
Procurement is rated satisfactory because the PIU followed the rules, procedures and guidelines
according to the World Bank‘s Procurement Specialist. Financial Management is rated
moderately satisfactory because payment schedules were not adequately respected for parts of
the Project; in particular during the first years when the inflow of counterpart funding was
irregular and the PIU organization contained two layers of procurement and financial
management personnel. The PIU cleared outstanding arrears during the last two years of the
Project and it also expediently produced detailed and exhaustive accounts requested by the
Implementation Completion and Results (ICR) Report author. Disbursement lagged due to the
political crises of 2001/2002 and 2009/2010 but disbursement caught up rapidly once the Project
was allowed to operate.

2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

40.      There is no proposal to implement a third PSD project. The World Bank‘s Finance and
Private Sector Development Department in the Africa Region is implementing a US$170 million
Integrated Growth Poles Project (effective September 28, 2005; closing December 31, 2012) that
is covering several activities that both complement and sustain some of the Project‘s previous
activities (e.g. EDBM). A second Growth Poles Project would be particularly relevant given the
priorities of private sector-led growth. The Government still holds a portfolio of poorly
performing public enterprises that would benefit from initiatives that would strengthen
management. Some of them need to be financially restructured or closed down. Developing a
stronger public private partnership framework is a high priority that the World Bank currently is
being drafted into providing support for.

41.      Continuing efforts to strengthen the regulatory capacity of key sectors would be useful to
lock in the Project‘s achievements in building institutions. Capacity building of the telecom
regulator is part of the IDA financed Madagascar Communications Infrastructure Project
(PICOM). Future activities may benefit from conditions that regulators are made meaningfully
independent, that competition plays a greater role in its objectives, and that revenues are
accounted for transparently. The establishment of the EDBM, which incorporated GUIDE and
role of CAPE, is an institution that has achieved very positive results and sustaining this
institution through permanent staff and a financial commitment by GOM is essential for
promoting entrepreneurship and investment.

3.        Assessment of Outcomes

3.1       Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

42.       The relevance of objectives, design and implementation is rated moderately satisfactory.

43.      The PDO of improving access and reliability of key utilities was highly relevant for
private sector development, investment promotion and shared growth. It remains highly relevant
until this day. Market liberalization, competition and effective regulation are necessary
components to improve market performance. By focusing on key factor markets (energy,
finance, telecoms, transport) as well as inefficient monopolies (airports, cotton, sugar), GOM
would have been well placed to achieve its development objectives in case reforms were
properly implemented. The current CAS (2007-2011)9 is organized around two main pillars:
activities that will help remove constraints to investment; and activities geared toward improving
the scope and quality of service delivery. Both pillars were the focus of the Project. In addition,
the CAS supports the Government‘s Madagascar Action Plan (MAP) 2007-2012, which was
prepared through extensive dialogue with the private sector and civil society, and includes eight
commitments of which the second commitment ―connected infrastructure‖ and sixth
commitment ―high growth economy‖ commensurate with the Project. Significantly increasing
investment to promote high growth is one of the key priority areas in this plan.10 Finally, the
World Bank Country Economist noted in April 2011 that achieving this PDO will remain a high
priority in the years to come.

44.      The original design of focusing primarily on strengthening regulatory capacity and
divesting of poorly performing public enterprises was also highly relevant but the case for
including the new PSD activities component was less apparent to achieve the PDO. These first
two components were essential for achieving the PDO and the project design reflected proper
diagnosis of a development priority that remains relevant. The design could have included more
concrete provisions for mechanisms controlling for market competition and ensuring that
regulatory agencies gained sufficient autonomy. The third component, in the PAD, ―New PSD
activities‖, was a weak and vaguely designed component. While establishing a center for the
promotion of MSEs (GUIDE) was useful in general, the design of the enlarged ‗New PSD
Activities‘ component following both the 2002 restructuring and the 2005 mid-term review
lacked in terms of demand analysis and few interventions did effectively address the
―competitiveness‖ of Malagasy companies. The redesign of this component affected the Project
negatively during implementation. In addition, the causality of some activities and PDO
achievement was vague and the PAD lacked an economic and financial analysis section.

45.     The actions taken in the implementation process were proactive and flexible but some
difficult decisions could have been taken earlier. The World Bank‘s implementation assistance
was adaptive to change, as the Project underwent one major and several minor restructurings,
and it was responsive to the needs of the country, as the priority of private sector competitiveness
was elevated. However, the willingness to add sub-components resulted in a Project that lost

some focus and covered too many activities. The focus on output indicators and limited
usefulness of the M&E framework led to lenient ratings of progress

3.2      Achievement of Project Development Objectives

46.     The achievement of the PDO, as summarized and derived in Tables 4-5, and analyzed in
detail in Annex 2, is rated moderately unsatisfactory. This rating is in line with the final
Implementation Status Report (ISR) rating that stressed that no progress towards PDO
achievement had been recorded following the implementation of OP/BP 7.30 in March 2009.
Table 4 presents a summary of achievements of the PDO based on the lengthy analysis in Annex
2. The first column divides the PDO up into five separate sections and presents the perceived
level of importance. The second column presents the achievement of key indicators while the
third column summarizes the achievement of PDOs and the ICR author‘s ratings.

                                                                technical assistance.

47.     The PDO following project effectiveness contained two sections that made up the core
PDO: (i) ―assist the Borrower to improve access, reliability and affordability of key utilities‖;
and (ii) ―increase the competitiveness of Malagasy companies‖ (see Table 5). The activities of
the first and second components (regulatory capacity building and transaction implementation)
addressed the former core PDO and the third component (new PSD activities) addressed the
latter core PDO. As noted in Tables 4-5, the achievement of the first core PDO is rated
moderately satisfactory and 66.3 percent of total disbursements (component 1: 16.7 percent;
component 2: 49.6 percent) were dedicated to this objective. The achievement of the second core
PDO is rated unsatisfactory and 33.7 percent of total disbursements were dedicated to this
objective. The conclusion is that the overall PDO achievement is moderately unsatisfactory
largely thanks to the poor performance of component 3.

 companies”


48.     In addition, the achievement of the main outcome indicator—“private investment in the
targeted sectors increased by US$100 million annually from 2004 to 2007”—was far not
achieved. Annex 2 presents data on both sector and aggregate levels and the analysis concludes
that this indicator was unfit the highly volatile political situation in Madagascar. The PIU
broadened the scope and monitored FDI as a share of GDP but this change drastically reduced
the causality between interventions and investment.

3.3    Efficiency

49.      Project efficiency is rated moderately unsatisfactory for the following reasons. First,
Annex 1 presents a cost breakdown by component and sub-component. It reveals that the initial
estimates in the PAD for supporting regulatory capacity building were greater than necessary, in
particular for OMERT, and the Project cut funding for several activities that performed poorly.
The regulatory capacity building component consumed 36 percent of the appraised funds and the
transaction implementation component made use of 79 percent of the appraised funds. The new
PSD activities component disbursed significantly more than the PAD had forecast; however, it
still disbursed slightly less expected at project restructuring.

50.     Second, according to STP, in 1999-2010, the total cost of the privatization process was
MGA 107.8 billion and the total income was MGA 118.5 billion, which resulted in a small but
positive balance of MGA 10.7 billion. Of the total income, roughly MGA 67.5 billion was
generated during the Project‘s effectiveness, in 2003-2010, and the cost was an estimated MGA
18.2 billion (see Annex 6). The TELMA privatization generated a large surplus in 2004 (see
Annex 2). The liquidations of ROSO, SINPA and SOMACODIS also generated large surpluses.
A net present value (NPV) calculation for the privatization and liquidation process starting in
2003 is an estimated MGA 39.0 billion for a discount rate of 10 percent and MGA 33.9 billion
for a discount rate of 15 percent (see Annex 3). However, these calculations do not take into
account US$3.9 million of expenditures of the Privatization Secretariat (STP). The privatization
did attract new investments but data are not readily available.

51.    Third, implementation efficiency was negatively affected by the political crises, which
produced new administrations, of which the first was less committed to the privatization process.
According to STP estimates, Government indecision on privatization led to MGA 56 billion
spent on studies and legal fees for the eight SOEs that were not privatized (see Annex 2). While

                                                    21
the Project covered a modest proportion of these expenditures, and some of these investments
may have been value for the companies at large, they did not help achieve the objectives that
they were meant to do. Finally, more than eight years passed between project effectiveness and
project closing. An earlier closing date, as originally planned, would have allowed the
Government to assess the costs and benefits, and design a new follow up Project that would
better have reflected the Government‘s priorities.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

52.     The overall outcome is rated moderately unsatisfactory. It takes into account the
relevance of objectives, design and implementation that was rated moderately satisfactory
(section 3.1), the achievement of the project development objectives that was rated moderately
unsatisfactory (section 3.2), and project effectiveness that was rated moderately unsatisfactory
(section 3.3). The rating is partly a reflection of the wavering commitment by the new
Government to follow through and implement the agreed privatization agenda, the unsatisfactory
results of the new PSD activities component, and prolonged period of project implementation
(including under OP/BP7.30). A more narrow interpretation of output components may have
warranted the moderately satisfactory rating of consecutive ISRs, but a strict interpretation of
actual outcomes lowers the overall impression.

53.     The Project can count several important achievements that were attained in a difficult
political environment: in particular the privatization of TELMA and HASYMA, the full
liquidation of 15 public enterprises and nearly full liquidation of another 12 public enterprises,
the establishment of one of Sub-Saharan Africa‘s first one stop shops (GUIDE) and its
incorporation into EDBM, which drastically reduced the time and procedures of starting a
business, and the strengthening of technical capacity at OMERT and OMH. The analysis and
arguments are developed at length in Annex 2.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)    Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

54.     The project was gender neutral and the Project‘s poverty impact is difficult to assess.
Annex 2 covers the achievements in terms of access, reliability and affordability of telecom
services and petroleum products. The PAD highlighted that the expected beneficiaries were all
agents in the economy, thus no particular interest group was identified. Arguably, the two most
important contributions to the poor are: (i) the direct impact that accessible, affordable and
higher quality telecom services as well as accessible, secure and higher quality petroleum goods
will have on poor consumers; and (ii) the increased scope for the Government to invest in for
example health and education resulting from its strengthened fiscal position after the divestiture
of loss making public enterprises.

(b)    Institutional Change/Strengthening

55.     During the course of the project, the regulatory agencies OMERT and OMH were
strengthened considerably through new equipment, training, etc. This impact will have a positive

                                               22
impact on the telecom and energy sectors for future generations. The outcome is far from perfect,
however, as both agencies need meaningful autonomy from the central Government. Increased
transparency in budget and decision making would lead to increased trust, broader support, and
healthy scrutiny of activities and decisions.

3.6      Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

56.     A Stakeholder Workshop with a group of Malagasy investors was organized during the
November 2010 ICR mission. The aim of the discussion was to get a clearer understanding of
how the privatization and liquidation process had been received by local investors—in particular
with regards to transparency, openness and fairness. In short, the group argued that the sale of
assets had been sufficiently open, transparent and equitable. It was not a perfect environment in
which to privatize and liquidate companies but STP and the liquidators did a good job and the
Ministry of Finance and Budget achieved a lot in a severe fiscal crisis. Annex 5 presents the
issues that were raised during the workshop and the participants‘ recommendations for any
future divestiture of publicly held assets.


4.       Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

57.     The risk that development outcomes will not be maintained is rated moderate. The
Project‘s main accomplishments in key areas such as regulatory capacity building and
privatization of public enterprises are to some extent irreversible. The main risk is that the
political and economical crises deepen further, or reach a steady state, which would dilute the
motivation of the civil service, compel leading staff to search for opportunities abroad, worsen
governance in regulatory agencies, EDBM and public enterprises, and bring the reform process
that Madagascar embarked upon in the 1990s to an indefinite standstill. In addition, some sub-
components, in particular for ‗New PSD Activities‘, did not deliver intended results and are
unlikely to do so in the short- or medium-term, including the EPZ and PTF.

      a. On regulatory capacity building, the establishments of OMH and OMERT, and the
         investments in activities to strengthen these institutions, have helped build significant
         technical expertise. The challenge is for GOM to strengthen these regulatory agencies
         and in particular increase their autonomy in order to avoid political interference and raise
         their effectiveness in achieving their goals. The situation is challenging for STP, which
         was first slimmed down and then left without staff from May 2011 onwards. It has put
         institutional memory of privatization and management of public enterprises at serious
         risk of being permanently lost. This would make future divestiture of public enterprises
         unnecessarily costly.

      b. On privatization, the telecoms market is now contested by four mobile telephony
         companies, two fixed broadband companies, and one fixed line operator. Accessibility
         and reliability are highly unlikely to deteriorate in the future. Similarly, there are four
         petroleum retailers, three logistics providers and one storage facility. There is a risk that
         high country risk will slow down investment necessary to further improve access and
         reliability of key utilities. As the analysis in Annex 2 of the telecoms sector highlighted,


                                                  23
         constant improvements are required only to stand still since almost all countries are
         implementing reforms and improving performance.
         Companies that were liquidated or privatized are unlikely to be taken over by GOM; thus
         the overall achievements of this component are unlikely to be reversed. There is a risk,
         however, that it will take a long time before divestiture of the remaining enterprises
         controlled by GOM will be a priority unless they bleed to the extent that GOM is forced
         to close them down—potentially in an uncontrolled manner. In addition, the aim of
         broadening private ownership of existing assets was seemingly never a priority of GOM,
         given the timid interest in empowering the PTF agency. Finally, there is a risk that
         creditors of several liquidated companies will have to wait for compensation as GOM
         faces a prolonged fiscal crisis.

      c. On new PSD activities, EDBM remains an important institution for entrepreneurs and
         investors and the two main risks it faces are: (i) finding a financially sustainable solution
         for the operation of its One Stop Shop offices; and (ii) ensure that performance is
         maintained. The original plans of establishing an EPZ in Tsarakofafa is unlikely to be
         realized anytime soon because the area is taken over by squatters.


5.       Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1      Bank Performance

(a)      Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

58.     Rated moderately satisfactory. The Project‘s objectives addressed high-priority issues
highlighted in the CAS and I-PRSP. The analytical foundation was solid and almost the entire
envelope of resources focused on building effective regulatory agencies and completing the
privatization agenda, which ensured adequate focus on two complementary areas of strategic
importance and great sensitivity. The long-term economic impact of these two activities is
positive. Environmental safeguards were adequately addressed and building upon the PATESP
Project ensured continuity in institutional capacity building and implementation support.

59.     The appraisal team dedicated significant attention to fiduciary aspects and the risk
assessment rightly identified the critical risk elements—including those that would subsequently
cause some havoc in implementation—in particular wavering GOM commitment for
privatization and introduction of competition (rated high), weak technical capacity of agencies
involved in program executing (rated substantial) and resistance of specific local groups to
liberalization (rated substantial). While the appraisal team also proposed a number of risk
mitigation measures for each risk factor, these were not protecting the Project from new
Government priorities. In hindsight, it would have been useful to wait some months for the
election to take place to ensure that the Project reflected the key priorities of the new
administration. Yet the ownership of the Project may have been limited at the outset given
GOM‘s negotiations with the International Monetary Fund and associated conditionality of
support.



                                                  24
60.      The weaknesses at entry were linked to the causality of some activities and the PDO and
outcome indicators; the M&E results framework, which should have been better designed, and
the new PSD activities component, which was small and inadequately linked to the original
PDO. The ambition was high at entry as the Government sought to leverage the existing
momentum but the Project was complex for a country with limited government capacity. Given
the substantial risks associated with privatization, there was a high risk that any mitigating
initiatives proposed at entry would be insufficient in a crisis.

(b)    Quality of Supervision

61.     Rated moderately unsatisfactory. The supervision missions were adequately used to
provide guidance and to take stock of achievements but the weak M&E framework failed to
effectively guide implementation. The records reveal that the supervision teams had a clear
appreciation of the issues and provided practical and realistic recommendations on how to move
forward. The action items emanating from the supervision documents could at times have been
more forceful, in particular since some sub-components failed to perform, and certain key
decisions should have been taken earlier. ISR ratings seemingly reflected the achievement of
outputs rather than outcomes and this approach may have reduced the incentives for more drastic
reform.

62.      The mid-term review was an ideal but missed opportunity to take action in reforming and
dropping underperforming sub-components. The EPZ sub-component is a case in point: contracts
could have been annulled earlier as there were clear indications that parties failed to deliver; and
the Project could have cancelled this item entirely at the mid-term review following the
outstanding issues—just like the supervision team later did with public enterprises stifled by
litigation and land issues (see Annex 2). Nevertheless, the supervision did take several important
and bold decisions, including the project restructuring in 2002 and the restructuring of the PIU in
2006. By greatly boosting the new PSD activities component in 2002 and 2005, the team
responded to the request of GOM but added complexity to an already very challenging project.

63.     The aide-memoires show that supervision was most intense at the beginning of the
project and that supervision was limited in 2005-2006 and 2009-2010; the latter period was a
result of the Project being under OP/BP 7:30. The supervision could have been more dedicated in
2005-2006, when the Project was in the late, critical stages of the original lifecycle, but the
Project benefited greatly from the fact that the TTL was based in Antananarivo for most of the
time; thus there was close interaction between the World Bank team and the PIU during the
course of the Project.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

64.     The overall bank performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory given the moderately
satisfactory rating (5.1 (c)) and moderately unsatisfactory (5.1. (b)) rating. The Project was
politically sensitive and implemented in an environment that was complex to navigate and results
were hampered by a lack of Government ownership. In this context, the Project still counted
several important achievements. It was technically well prepared and the Project acted swiftly to
Government requests and changing conditions despite some unfortunate additions of sub-


                                                25
components that subsequently failed to perform. Looking back, the third component on new PSD
activities would probably have been better left to a separate World Bank Project and the
performance indicators should have been better designed and applied. Supervision was adequate
but uneven in intensity. The Project was arguably allowed to run for too long although
implementation was interrupted by political crises at the start and end of the Project. The mid-
term review opportunity to thoroughly restructure the project was not made use of but
interventions from 2006 onwards show a heightened urgency to focus on results.

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a)    Government Performance

65.      Rated moderately unsatisfactory. The political crisis that broke out only a few months
after board approval had a profound impact on the Project and its ability to achieve its objectives.
While the Project was restructured before effectiveness, this ICR has made it clear that the new
Government was unwilling, and sometimes unable, to effectively implement the agreed agenda,
and that Government ownership in the difficult economic and political environment was low.
While it remains unclear to what extent GOM‘s privatization agenda was a response to internal
priorities vs. external pressure, the GOM did insist on repeatedly extending the closing date of
the Project, which is a sign that it did value the activities. The government report in Annex 7 also
highlights that it is fairly content with the Project outcomes given the many challenges. The
rating is based on the following main arguments. First, the privatization agenda was reduced in
scope and after some early gains in terms of HASYMA and TELMA in 2004, the remaining list
of SOEs were never privatized due to political decisions. The PIU was also meant to carry out an
extensive public communications campaign in support of the privatization process but GOM
insisted on controlling this function and the dedication by ministries was poor.

66.      Second, the regulatory agencies OMH and OMERT were strengthened through the
support of the PIU but they remain toothless as important decisions are taken by relevant
ministries. Thus, the critical issue of allowing these agencies some autonomy to effectively carry
out their mandates was ignored. Third, broadening local private ownership was a key goal of the
Project. The Government‘s refusal to transfer more than a small proportion of agreed assets to
the PTF that was technically in charge of managing this equity process was another sign of a lack
of commitment. Fourth, the significant number of creditors whom the Government has yet to
reimburse following corporate liquidation is perhaps more a sign of the fiscal crisis lately
afflicting the country; but it is nevertheless inconsistent with standard procedures. Finally, the
Government did not resolve implementation issues in a timely manner and counterpart funding
was disbursed late in the early years, which subsequently led to the Project financing 100 percent
of the portfolio activities. These issues impeded the PIU to effectively implement the agenda and
achieve development objectives.

(b)    Implementing Agency Performance

67.    Rated moderately satisfactory. On the positive side, the agency was highly committed to
achieving the development objectives. There was plenty of beneficiary and stakeholder
consultation although this engagement was partly a result of the nature of the Project and its sub-


                                                26
components of public private dialogue, privatization and liquidation, and trade and investment
promotion. There was also seemingly a strong commitment to properly arrange for transition
towards the end. Books were kept in order. The head of the PIU prepared a lengthy and detailed
account of both failures and achievements. The next generation of reformers will greatly benefit
from reading this report. Although the PIU struggled with the resignations of a few key staff
members, it was active in recruiting new staff that were adequately trained. In addition, the PIU
followed agreed guidelines in the privatization process and paid sufficient attention to detail and
procedures, for example in preparing environmental audits and studies.

68.     On the negative side, during the first half of the Project, the PIU was a bloated
bureaucracy, which slowed down progress and effectiveness. The appointment of a person
without M&E experience to be in charge of the M&E framework negatively affected the
monitoring and evaluation activities during the first half of the Project. In addition, during the
first half of the Project, the lack of timely payments of consultants adversely affected the
effectiveness of these consultants‘ work and gave the Project a poor reputation among external
experts. While this mismanagement of payments may have been due to the lack of timely
disbursements of counterpart funding, it lowers the overall impression of the performance.

(c)    Overall Borrower Performance

69.     Overall borrower performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory. This rating is due to the
lack of commitment on the part of the Government to take proper action to allow the Project to
progress according to existing agreements. Insufficient government attention did not reflect the
commitment by the PIU that largely performed its tasks in a timely and professional fashion
notwithstanding very difficult political and economic circumstances and a suboptimal
organizational structure. As per Operations Policy and Country Service (OPCS) guidelines,
overall borrower performance is rated on the basis of the moderately unsatisfactory rating of
government performance, the moderately satisfactory rating of Implementing Agency (PIU)
performance, and the outcomes of the Project.


6.     Lessons Learned

70.     This ICR stresses some old but equally important lessons. Some of the lessons are not
original but mistakes are repeated because the incentive structure and the political environment
in which the World Bank and the client operate seldom change. The ICR recorded how the
challenges include: (i) the aversion to decentralize decision making and cede control of public
assets; (ii) the risk of reform fatigue; (iii) the inclination to influence staff appointments; (iv)
coordination failures between public agencies; and (v) the difficult task of remaining both
responsive to evolving client needs and ensuring focus and simplicity in project design.
Managing long-term projects successfully in politically turbulent countries requires not only
experience and smart project design but also timing and effective public communication.

71.    Securing government ownership and commitment are paramount and can never be
underestimated. While the Project was substantially restructured to better reflect the priorities of
the new government‘s priorities in 2002, it did not go far enough to reengage the new
administration to the extent necessary to privatize all companies or empower autonomous

                                                27
regulatory agencies. The experience offers three main lessons. First, it may be advisable to
design and agree on a politically sensitive project post-election if an election is imminent in a
politically turbulent environment. Second, if there are clear signs of a lack of political
commitment—to the extent that several components are performing weakly—a comprehensive
adjustment according to the Government‘s agenda may be necessary to get the project on track;
tinkering with smaller ad hoc adjustments is less likely to achieve the required momentum.
Third, the mid-term review is the ideal opportunity to comprehensively restructure projects. The
mid-term review was here a missed opportunity. In addition, securing counterpart funding from
the client may be one way of strengthening political commitment.

72.      In least developed countries with weak government capacity, simplicity and prioritization
are essential in project design. Pleasing all ministries will lower the effectiveness of
implementation and the likelihood of success. Remaining attentive to the Government‘s shifting
priorities is essential for a good bank-client relation but adding new activities that are beyond the
original scope of the project may reduce the chance of successful implementation. For private
sector development activities, it is particularly important to only incorporate components that are
demand driven from the private sector‘s perspective. Establishing export processing zones, or
special economic zones, are particularly difficult in a developing country environment and a
five-year project is unlikely to achieve major results in terms of employment and investment
unless all conditions are in place and the activity already under way.

73.     A coherent and realistic M&E framework that is aligned to the PDO adds clarity, purpose
and guidance throughout a project while a weak M&E framework easily becomes a liability
rather than an asset in implementation. Leveraging existing databases simplifies data collection.
Whenever existing databases are insufficient, developing structured baseline data at the start of
the project is essential for consistency. In addition, the analysis of the M&E framework
concluded that the use of inflows of private investment is a risky outcome indicator in a country
plagued by a high level of country risk (i.e. political uncertainty). The achievement of outcome
indicators should be the focus during project supervision since output indicators may be
insufficiently linked to results.

74.     The development of filters that capture political economy risks in project design, and
redesign, would be particularly useful to assess realistic outcomes. It would also allow the World
Bank team to look beyond the reform priorities of what is technically relevant and what
government requests entail. A critical assessment of what is politically feasible given the
political capital of the governing party is likely to help manage expectations and align targets to
achievable results. The ICR highlighted that projects with uncommitted clients should not be
allowed to run for years beyond the original time plan. If there is a case for a new project, the
new design can incorporate recent lessons.

75.     The structure of the PIU is essential for effective implementation. Key appointments
must be made on a meritocratic basis and not through discretionary appointments. The
organizational structure and staffing must reflect the objectives and expected workload: it must
be nimble but yet house enough technical expertise. When the organizational structure is
ineffective, the World Bank and the Government must take swift action to remedy the situation.
While these guidelines are rather obvious, it takes leadership and painful negotiations to get the

                                                 28
appropriate team and structure in place. Bloated bureaucracies can be less effective than
understaffed ones.

76.     Successful privatization is particularly closely linked to establishing a constituency for
reform at the political level. An effective communication campaign is paramount in this process
and communication campaigns are best controlled by the privatization/implementation agency
rather than individual ministries in case there is insufficient ministerial support. The
implementation of a privatization agenda may work better if it is part of a broader reform
program but this does not imply that the same PIU should be in charge of multiple activities
beyond regulatory capacity building and transaction implementation. In case there is strong
resistance to ceding of public ownership, alternative initiatives to privatization, such as private
management contract, may be a useful option. Liquidation of public enterprises must be swiftly
executed since the assets quickly degenerate once employees realize that there is no future for
the enterprise. The privatization process should preferably commence only when the
Government has removed legal uncertainties, including with regards to taxation (federal vs.
provincial). Finally, timely clarity on project extension benefits the PIU since temporary staff
need visibility not to seek new opportunities beyond the project.

                                Annex 2. Outcome by Component

1.      The achievement of the main outcome indicator—“private investment in the targeted
sectors increased by US$100 million annually from 2004 to 2007”—was difficult to establish
because of a lack of authoritative data sources. In addition, this indicator was imperfect because
the highly volatile political situation in Madagascar did not lend itself well to the attraction of
investment. The PIU broadened the scope and monitored FDI as a share of GDP. In 2002-2005,
net inflows of FDI as a share of GDP was relatively low as Madagascar slowly recovered from
the twin political and economical crises. It then increased rapidly in 2005-2007 as net inflows of
FDI increased from less than 2 percent of GDP to 11 percent of GDP (see Annex 2). FDI reached
high levels as two major mining operations—Rio Tinto in Fort Dauphin and Sherritt
International Corporation in Ambatovy—developed new mines. However, these investments are
not linked to the activities of the Project.

2.      In 2009, the rate almost halved from a high point in 2008 when the country plunged back
into political turmoil and if the political crisis of 2001-2002 is any indication of the impact on
FDI in 2010-2011 and beyond, FDI is likely to have dropped drastically and it is likely to remain
low for the foreseeable future. On a sector level, investment in the telecom sector increased in
2004-2007; or from $13 million in 2004 to $120 million in 2007 (see Annex 2). For the
petroleum sector, private investment data are not available. The target of annually increasing
private investment by $100 million was not met. The period of relative stability during the
Project—in 2005-2008—private investment in other sectors than natural resources grew rapidly
from low levels. This fact underpins the assumption of the project preparation and design team:
that there is huge scope for Madagascar to increase private investment once it manages to
develop an economy and political system that are more insulated from political shocks.

   I.      Telecommunications

3.       To what extent did the Project succeed in achieving its PDO of improving access,
reliability and affordability of telecommunication services? The data reveal that two of the three

                                                      32
KPIs exceeded their targets and the third KPI was partially met (Table 6). An analysis of more
extensive data sources reveals that the Project had a mixed impact on the overall PDO. Access
did indeed improve, reliability improved significantly, but affordability, while improved in
particular for mobile telephony, remains relatively low. Investment in infrastructure did pick up
significantly but only towards the end of the project lifecycle. There is currently only one
provider of fixed line telephony (TELMA), two providers of broadband (Blueline and MOOV –
a subsidiary of TELMA), and three providers of mobile telephony (Life, Orange, TELMA and
Zain). Mobile Internet can also be provided by the mobile telephony companies. The following
analysis draws mainly on data collected from the databases of the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU).11

4.      Access: ITU‘s ICT Development Index (IDI) has a sub-                                       Access (2008)
index that measures ICT access.12 It is composed of five indicators                                Ranking Score
that carry equal weight: (i) fixed telephone line penetration, (ii)               Indian Ocean
mobile cellular penetration, (iii) international Internet bandwidth                  Maldives        57      4.61
per Internet user, (iv) the proportion of households with                            Seychelles      64      4.30
computers, and (v) the proportion of households with Internet                        Mauritius       66      4.19
access. Four of the five indicators (1-iii + v) are good measures                 Top-3 SSA
for the PDO.                                                                        South Africa     94      3.14
                                                                                    Cape Verde      102      2.77
5.      In 2002, the year of project effectiveness, Madagascar                      Gabon           103      2.71
ranked 125 out of 154 countries. In 2007, Madagascar‘s score had                  Madagascar
increased by 70%—a significant improvement—but its relative                        Tanzania         137      1.54
ranking had not changed as other countries also improved ICT                       Madagascar       138      1.47
access. In 2008, Madagascar ranked 138 out of 159 countries:                       Haiti            139      1.47
slightly ahead of Comoros, Lesotho, Malawi and Mozambique but
                                                                                  Bottom-3 SSA
somewhat behind Kenya, Niger, Nigeria and Tanzania (see table                       Guinea          156      1.09
on the right). Thus, Madagascar did not do worse than the average                   Chad            158      1.02
LDC in the region but that the country has scope to improve                         Eritrea         159      0.89

6.      Reliability: In 2000, there was a 79 percent annual fault rate for fixed lines and this
changed little in 2001 (78 percent). However, in 2002-03, the fault rate dropped to 45-60 percent
and by 2006, the fault rate reached 36 percent. Similarly, the share of telephone faults cleared by
the next working day jumped from 32 percent in 2001 to 55 percent in 2006. This data are
confirmed by consistent anecdotal evidence: all Malagasy consulted during the mission argued
that there had been great improvement in reliability during the course of the Project. TELMA
argued that current consumption patterns make use of less than 10 percent of telecom capacity
and that quality as a result has increased.

   On the existing regulatory framework in telecoms is far from optimal (yet this assessment is beyond the scope of
this assessment). Important measures that have yet to be taken by the authorities are: (i) adoption of Law 2005-03;
(ii) replacement of OMERT by the new regulatory agency ARTEC; and (iii) the end of exclusive rights for TELMA,
which is still partially state-owned (feedback from peer reviewers).

7.      Affordability: first, connection fees dropped significantly during the course of the
project. In 2000, the mobile cellular connection charge and the residential telephone connection
charge were US$22 and US$31 respectively. By 2006, the same charges had decreased to US$5
and US$23 respectively. Second, the price for a basket of ICT services (fixed, mobile, internet)
dropped during the course of the project but it still remained among the highest in the world (see
Figure 5). In 2009, Madagascar ranked 156th out of 161 countries in ITU‘s ICT Price Basket (a
lower ranking indicates lower affordability). In the same year, Madagascar had the fourth least
affordable fixed line services out of the 161 countries (see Figure 7). This was still a minor
improvement from 2008 when it was the least affordable country. TELMA has a monopoly
position for fixed line telephony and the reforms have not been successful in allowing market
forces to function properly. Voice-over-internet-protocol (VOIP) is eating into the business,
copper wire is frequently stolen, and investment in fixed line infrastructure is seemingly not a
high priority.

8.      For mobile telephony, in 2009, affordability was almost as low: Madagascar ranked 156th
out of 161 countries (see Figure 6). In Ethiopia and Senegal, mobile telephony was thrice as
affordable while in Bangladesh and Sudan it was 8-10 times as affordable. Finally, for internet
broadband, in 2009, Madagascar ranked 149th out of 161 countries (see Figure 8). Broadband
was more than ten times as affordable in Bolivia and Sudan than in Madagascar. In Kenya and
Zambia, it was five times as affordable. The comparisons indicate that the reforms were
insufficient to attain the affordability target. Yet taxation plays a role: according to GSMA, and
cited by industry insiders, the tax on total telecom revenue is 45 percent in Madagascar, which is
higher than a Sub-Saharan African average of 30 percent.13 For example, Katz et al. (2009)
defines Madagascar‘s approach to taxation in the telecom sector as protectionism, service tax
maximization and sector distortion.

9.      The incumbent, TELMA, which has a monopoly for fixed line telephony, argues that
there are significant issues because of certain rules of retailing: loss making telephone booths
must be maintained; and business-to-business activity is hurt through a technical loophole
allowing fixed line–to-mobile phone calls to be counted as mobile-to-mobile calls. However, for
mobile services, TELMA argues that the last years have seen increased price pressure (95
percent of market is pre-paid and it now charges per second), which has resulted in an explosion
in penetration/access.

10.     Investment: the telecom reforms partly aimed at attracting new private investment in
infrastructure and Madagascar did rather poorly in this area during the first half of the project.
Investment increased by 50 percent between 2001 and 2003 but from rather low levels. It then
started to take off in 2006 (there are no data for 2005). In 2007-2009, the average level of
investment in the telecom sector was more than eight times the level in 2001-2003, which
probably was impeded by the political crisis. TELMA argues that it has invested more than its
business plan had forecast and privatization agreement stipulated. There is now a 6,000 km
national backbone of which half is below ground cable and half is fiber optic cable above
ground. However, there is only one fiber optic backbone in the country and OMERT manages
the wholesale price of capacity; thus the competitors are purchasing fiber optic capacity from
TELMA.

     II.     Petroleum

11.     To what extent did PDSP2 succeed in achieving its PDO of improving access, reliability
and affordability of petroleum services? Madagascar remains one of the most expensive
countries in Africa and the world to fill up a tank of gasoline or diesel. Coupled with the
country‘s low income per capita, affordability is low and gasoline and diesel prices have
increased significantly during the course of the Project. These increases are attributable to
international commodity prices, the level of energy taxation, and the rents enjoyed by some
players in the value chain. The price of petroleum is a highly sensitive political issue and there is
occasional tension between the private retailers and the Government. This tension has led to both
unilateral and bilateral actions involving the Government, for example related to adjustments of
the exchange rate, tax policy, subsidies and discussions about price controls and increased public
ownership.

12.     Since its establishment in 1998, the petroleum regulator OMH has increased its technical
competence and hired new talent. In 2010, it had 67 staff members of whom 30 were technicians.
According to experts consulted for the ICR, OMH has the technical capacity to regulate and
monitor the industry but it is a politicized agency that is perceived to closely follow the orders of
the Ministry of Mines and Energy. The regulator does not maintain a continuous dialogue with
the private sector but representatives meet whenever there is an issue that needs to be solved.
OMH argued during the ICR mission that the Project had provided support in the early years, in
particular for the environmental post-liberalization audit of SOLIMA, which took place over four
years‘ time starting in 2003. A committee was established to respond to the recommendations of
this audit. New construction in the post-liberalization era is well specified and monitored by
OMH.

13.    There is currently low visibility for further investment due to the political environment.
For example, following the political crisis in 2002, Shell delayed new investment until 2007.
Since privatization, Galana has invested around US$25 million in a new jetty and more than
US$5 million in modernization on top of US$3-5 million/year in distribution. According to
industry insiders, the local incentives are attractive for operations but the high country risk
impedes new investment.

14.      Access: There is currently a single storage facility in Tamatave—by the old refinery—
that handles roughly 95 percent of Madagascar‘s petroleum consumption. It is imported through
the seaport in Tamatave. This quasi-monopoly enjoyed by Galana GRT means that deregulation
remains an unfinished affair. In theory, new storage facilities could be constructed by
competitors but there are rules on the national coverage which makes such an expansion
unattractive. There are three logistics companies that service the petroleum sector—two of which
are controlled by GALANA—and there are logistical challenges related to the single storage
facility, Madagascar‘s poor road network, and the long distances, mountainous landscape and
limited volume. Galana‘s logistics costs constitute around 7-8 percent of total costs and Shell‘s
logistics/distribution costs one-sixth of the import price. There are finally four retailers of
petroleum (Galana, Jovenna, Shell, Total) that manage service stations and market petroleum
products across the country. A retailer needs to operate a minimum of eight service stations
according to the law. Anecdotal evidence points to the fact that there are no queues following the
liberalization of SOLIMA.

15.     Reliability: There is too little information available to properly assess the developments
in terms of reliability—quality and supply—but anecdotal evidence indicates that there is a clear
improvement and that the standards of most service stations are high these days. Oil quality is
higher; there is more choice and nicer presentation. While OMH monitors environmental
performance, the oil companies often have higher standards than those imposed. There are some
environmental issues that are yet to be settled for the old refinery, which was closed down in
2004/05. According to the petroleum retailers, the private sector has lived up to its responsibility
but the Government‘s environmental work has lagged. However, OMH argued that there are no
real environmental concerns—before the liberalization process was implemented they used to
have environmental problems in the ports—and that the liberalization process increased the
security of supply. OMH also noted that some deliveries have been delayed, for example due to
cyclones, but there are never any fuel shortages.

16.     Affordability: Malagasy diesel and gasoline prices are some of the highest in the world
in absolute terms. In 2002, the year of effectiveness of the project, the super gasoline price in
Madagascar was the highest in the 43 African countries measured by GTZ (see Figure 9). At
US$1.08/l, it was significantly higher than in the second most expensive African country (C.A.R.
at US$1.00/l). In the same year, the Malagasy diesel price, at US$0.65/l, was the sixth highest in
Africa. In November 2008, towards the end of the Project, Malagasy diesel and gasoline prices
remained among Africa‘s (and the world‘s) highest. The price gap in 2002 between the diesel
and gasoline was also almost neutralized. At US$1.43/l, Madagascar‘s diesel price was the fourth
highest out of 47 African countries and more than thrice the price in South Africa (see Figure
10). The gasoline price, at $1.55/l, was the continent‘s seventh highest, but below the price in
some nearby countries such as Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia. In 2002, the price of 252 l of

                         318 l of gasoline equaled the average output per capita.15

                         17.     The increases in the price of diesel and gasoline in Madagascar were not explained solely
                         by changes in the price of crude oil at world markets and OMH argues that the high price is a
                         serious concern. As Figure 11 illustrates, the crude price was rather stable in the 1990s and so
                         were the prices of diesel and gasoline in Madagascar. As the trend price of crude oil rose during
                         much of the 2000s, the diesel and gasoline prices rose significantly faster, including between
                         2006 and 2008 when the crude oil price dropped. The cause of the seeming decoupling between
                         the crude oil price on the one hand and the diesel and gasoline prices in Madagascar on the other
                         hand was partly due to taxation policy: as Figure 12 below shows, GOM imposes relatively high
                         fuel taxes as a mean for collecting government revenue but this is not the whole story. OMH
                         argued that the effective rate of taxation was 30-35 percent for gasoline and 20-25 percent for
                         diesel; resulting in a weighted average of around 30 percent. Shell noted that the effective tax
                         rate was 37 percent: 20 percent VAT and 17 percent for the remaining taxes. The storage
                         monopoly and limited logistics options are the obvious areas where competition is limited; and
                         hence rents may be enjoyed by the owners.

Component 2: Transaction implementation

18.      The second component had three sub-components: (i) capacity building at the
Privatization Secretariat (STP) and PASERP to support the privatization process; (ii) increasing
local asset ownership through support of PTF; and (iii) providing retraining possibilities through
PASERP. The project financed consulting services and covered operational costs of the technical
agencies STP, PASERP and PTF. In summary, the Project did strengthen STP and PASERP and
help these agencies achieve several of their objectives, in particular PASERP, although STP has
been dismantled following shifting priorities of the Government. The sub-component that aimed
at increasing local asset ownership through support of PTF did not achieve its objective.
PASERP did provide vocational training to a very large number of workers. However, there is
little information about the quality of training and number who found a new job.

(i)        Strengthening STP
19.     (STP was responsible for the technical preparation and implementation of the
privatization agenda. The following assessment argues that the Project could have done better
but that it acted under extremely difficult circumstances that to a large extent were beyond the
reach of the PIU itself.

20.      Main achievements: GOM‘s entire divestiture program included 54 public enterprises
whereas the PAD covered four SOEs (ADEMA, HASYMA, SIRAMA, TELMA) and thirty
public SMEs. Almost all publicly held enterprises were mismanaged and common issues
included absence of audited accounts, undeclared assets, high levels of mortgaged debt, ongoing
litigation procedures, salary arrears, and negative cash flow and/or bankruptcy. Asset sales began
in 1999 and were originally executed directly by the Government. Following the 2002 and 2005
restructurings, the Project provided support to the privatization process of six SOEs of which
three companies were executed during the Project (RNCFM Nord, HASYMA, TELMA) and
three companies that were not effectively privatized (ADEMA, JIRAMA, SIRAMA).

        Fifteen public enterprises were liquidated as part of the Project: AAA, AFM, ANM,
         ARS, FEB, CMN, FESA, Forestas, Serdi, Sevima, SIB, Socomi, Somadex, Somalac,
         Sopraex and Torginol. These companies did not owe any debt to creditors or the income
         from the liquidation process covered outstanding debt.

        Twelve public enterprises were liquidated but the Government has yet to clear
         outstanding debt to creditors: Bcl, Famama, Fev, Kafema, Lansu, Roso, Sice, Soama,
         Sogedis, Somacodis, Somapalm and Sumatex. The amount that GOM owes the creditors
         amounted to MGA 18.63 billion according to reports issued by the liquidators on
         December 31, 2008.16 STP executed all necessary steps of the liquidation process in its
         control.

        Eight records of liquidation were suspended pending the processing of land issues and
         other disputes: Coroi, Darrieux, Fifabe, Fima, Sinpa, Sorima, Smtm, and some assets of
         SOLIMA.

21.     TELMA: The former telecom monopoly was partly privatized already in 1998 when
France Cable Radio (FCR), a subsidiary of France Telecom, procured 34 percent of the
company. The Project supported the second round aimed at divesting 34 percent of GOM‘s
remaining 66 percent of the company. France Telecom was allowed to participate in the
international tendering process under the obligation that it had to sell its shares to the successful
bidder unless it produced the highest bid. In December 2001, Distacom Ltd won the bidding
process and following the protracted political crisis of 2002, negotiations between GOM and
Distacom recovered only by October 22, 2002. France Telecom, which had made the second
most attractive bid, brought a complaint to the Supreme Court of Madagascar to seek annulment
of the interim award. The Supreme Court dismissed this complaint on February 12, 2003. A
purchase agreement was signed on August 26, 2003 and GOM and Distacom agreed to conduct a
due diligence of TELMA to assess any developments since the submission of bids in 2001. The
due diligence process was expected to close in December 2003 but data collection difficulties
delayed this process until March 2004. The auditors hired by Distacom and GOM came to
different conclusions: Distacom argued that it had evidence that diminished the value of the
company while GOM concluded that there were no major obstacles to closing the deal as
originally agreed. The parties negotiated a new deal that was agreed on June 4, 2004, in which
Distacom agreed to pay US$12.6 million each to GOM and France Telecom.

22.      The negotiation lasted a full year after which GOM granted Distacom concessions that
were not in the initial offering. The final agreement was complex and some concessions were
unfortunate because they impeded competition, reduced tax revenue, and reduced the scope to
realize productivity improvements. The agreement included among others: (i) a government
allocation of US$15 million to TELMA over three years for the company's acquisition of
hardware and telecommunications equipment for rural areas, (ii) corporate tax exemptions over a
five-year period, (iii) a government commitment not to issue any new fixed telephony or mobile
telephony license until June 30, 2008, (iv) a corporate commitment to start up a mobile
telephony service by June 2007, (v) a government commitment to allocate 4 percent of its shares
to staff of TELMA, and (vi) a corporate commitment to not make any staff redundant during an
initial three-year period. The lengthy negotiations and concessions did not build confidence in
the Government‘s ability to handle the privatization process in a fair and transparent manner.
The concessions to Distacom were due to GOM‘s desire to close the negotiations, some of which
were to the detriment of development objectives in the telecom industry. In hindsight, it would
probably have been wiser to reopen the tendering process.

23.     HASYMA: DAGRIS paid US$1.65 million for 51.98% of HASYMA as GOM kept 10%
of the capital. The transaction was agreed in August 2004 following an environmental audit
completed in February 2004 and an international tendering process with three bidders. Despite
some technical difficulties, the transaction closed in October 2004 and the process was largely
within the original timeline and regarded a success. The bidders were satisfied with the conduct
of the operation and transparency of procedures.

24.    Northern RNCFM Network: The contract for the northern concession was signed
between GOM and COMAZAR in 2002 but the agreement could not be entered into force until
early July 2003 because of some uncertainties of the responsibility of the two actors. A new


                                                 43
timetable was established with a committee headed by STP and the divestiture was completed on
July 1, 2003, with the creation of the company Madarail. The concession fees amounted to
MGA1.18 billion from 2003 to 2009. The PIU was heavily used to sort out post-privatization
issues.

In addition, the Project supported some diagnostics for eight additional public enterprises that
GOM later decided to not privatize. The return on this investment is therefore largely a sunk cost
from the Project‘s perspective but it is likely to benefit other stakeholders in the area in the
future.

25.     Air Madagascar: a tender for the privatization of Air Madagascar was launched in 2001
but the new Government canceled it during the evaluation process. GOM subsequently signed a
management contract on a sole source basis with Lufthansa Consulting for the period October
2002 to May 2006. Since then, GOM has made no decision concerning the outcome of the
privatization of Air Madagascar.

26.    Sofitrans: a tender for the privatization of Sofitrans was launched in 2001 but GOM
canceled this process and no direction has been given for the future status of this company.

27.     Society Batelage Manakara (SBM): the company was added to the list of SOEs to be
privatized in 2003 as part of the concessioning of the port with the network Manakara Southern
RNCFM. A tender was issued by the Ministry of Transport in 2005 but declared void after the
opening of the bids. GOM has not decided what to do with SBM although the Department of
Transport recently proposed its liquidation.

28.    South RNCFM Network: has remained under the administration of RNCFM.

29.    Centre Industriel du Bois d'Andasibe (CIBA): a tender dossier for the company
producing the wooden sleepers for RNCFM was prepared in 2008, revised in 2009, but the
tendering process had not been launched for sale of the company‘s assets.

30.    ADEMA: the Project funded the environmental audit of the company and studies on the
concessioning of ADEMA were conducted by the Ministry of Transport in 2005 with support
from IFC. GOM has not made any decision on the privatization of the company.

31.     SIRAMA: GOM owns 72 percent of the company and Sofire, SGR and Sonapar control
28 percent. The company has major financial problems and its industrial and agricultural
infrastructure is largely obsolete. For example, SIRAMA does not keep audited accounts and the
latest financial statement was produced in 2003. In June 2004, SIRAMA signed a two-year
management contract worth 3.6 million euro with Lenferna and Tom & Rey-Sude-MAINTEX
for its four production units. The contract was terminated in September 2006. The company
retrenched 3,304 employees in 2005-2007 out of an initial workforce of 6,551 employees. GOM
took responsibility of the payment of corresponding fees, payment arrears and expenses related
to reintegration activities, for a total of MGA 56.7 billion in 1999-2010.




                                               44
32.     The Project funded various studies to a total cost of MGA 1.5 billion in preparation for
privatization of the company. A report on options to privatize SIRAMA was presented to GOM
in December 2005, including a plan for the financial restructuring of the company. However,
GOM has made no decision on the privatization of the company. In 2006 the Project withdrew
from SIRAMA following an agreement between the Office of the President, the Minister of
Economy and the World Bank. In June 2007, a 20-year lease agreement was signed between
GOM and the company Complant for the Ambilobe and Namakia sites following a tender
launched by SIRAMA itself. This contract generates an annual income of US$3.5 million and
GOM made some payments of wage arrears in these two locations. Overall, the half-hearted
attempt by GOM to divest of SIRAMA has been costly and unsuccessful: in 2003-2010, the
expenditures amounted to MGA 86.14 billion while revenue amounted to MGA 19.49 billion. Of
those expenditures, the Project contributed MGA 2.80 billion to social safeguards measures
(MGA 1.6 billion) and studies (MGA 1.2 billion).

33.    At project closing, SIRAMA had 700 employees at headquarter and the Brickaville and
Nosy Be locations. The total wage arrears of staff were paid by the Ministry of Finance and
Budget in December 2009 and it paid MGA 6.84 billion in arrears to SIRAMA‘s creditors in
2009-2010. The staff was laid off from that date although 74 people are hired to maintain
services at each site. The factories in Nosy Be and Brickaville that remained under the
management of SIRAMA stopped their activities in 2005 and 2007 respectively. In 2010,
Complant, the company leasing the Namakia and Ambilobe and locations, produced 37,181 tons
of sugar. SIRAMA‘s outstanding debt in November 2010 still amounted to MGA 51.39 billion.

34.     JIRAMA: GOM decided in 2003 to evaluate options for reforming the company. In
April 2005, the Project co-funded a two-year management contract signed with Lahmeyer
International. It also funded several consultants for the implementation of the management
contract, audits of performance indicators of the management contract, a task force, and
assessments of the implementation of the reorganization plan of JIRAMA. At the time of closing,
JIRAMA was still in Government hands.

35.    In summary, GOM registered a number of companies on the list of SOEs to be privatized
in 1997 but lack a clear decision on its implementation. In the case of SIRAMA, the company
collapsed in this lengthy process. Studies that were supported by the Project were repeatedly
updated without effective implementation.

36.    The main challenges faced by this sub-component were due in large part to the
prevarication and change in priorities by the new Government but also to: (i) the legal
uncertainty of the divestiture process; (ii) the frequent changes in the institutional setup; (iii) the
resignation by two key personnel within STP; and (iv) the insufficient external relations and
communications campaigns. STP‘s capacity to effectively implement the original divestiture
process was restrained during the course of the project as it struggled to keep up with the original
timeline of divestiture. The Project had little limited influence in this process as GOM was in
charge of the decision making process.

37.     First, during the course of the project, the divestiture of public sector enterprises was
largely governed by Law No. 2003-051 enacted on January 30, 2004. This law, which revised


                                                  45
Law No. 96-011 enacted on August 13, 1996, was never decreed. STP helped draft a decree and
it also identified a number of anomalies that were never addressed by GOM.17 STP then
proceeded with the implementation of the new act without proper instructions on procedural
arrangements. Implementation of Law No. 2003-051 in the absence of relevant decrees was a
risky process as third parties at any time could challenge the process, which was also highlighted
at the investor‘s roundtable discussions organized during the ICR mission (Annex 5). At the time
of closing, however, no legal challenge had been recorded.

38.     Under the provisions of Law No. 2003-051, STP lost its executive authority to the
various ministries overseeing the activities of each public enterprise. For example, the
preparatory work undertaken for the ADEMA privatization and the tendering process of the
Southern RNCFM Network were carried out directly by the Ministry of Transport. In the case of
SIRAMA, the lease agreements for the sugar factories in Namakia and Ambilobe were executed
by SIRAMA itself. The operations that remained the responsibility of STP were asset and equity
sales, capital increases with waivers of preferential rights of the state, issuing of convertible
bonds, liquidations, mergers and demergers. According to the STP Director, the notion of
transparency in the new Act was not explicit, which leaves questions open about some contracts.

39.     Second, since the privatization process was set in motion in 1996 there have been three
changes in the ministerial setup for this process and two changes in technical guidance. In 2002,
the divestiture activities were entrusted to the newly established Ministry of Privatization. In
March 2003, however, the Ministry of Privatization was dissolved and the divestiture activities
were entrusted to the Ministry of Finance and Budget and its Department of Privatization
Operations. In January 2004, Law No. 2003-051 formally abolished the Privatization Committee
established as part of the previous law (Act No. 96-011) as all divestiture activities were reported
directly to the Ministry of Finance and Budget. In 2007, another institutional shakeup within the
Ministry of Finance and Budget resulted in the dissolution of the Department of Privatization
Operations. Adjusting to these reorganizations affected the speed of implementation of the
privatization and liquidation agenda.

40.     Third, the Project was off to a rough start in its effort to build capacity at STP. In 1997-
2002, STP had 23 employees that were active in the first major round of privatization. When the
Project became effective and its implementation was due to commence in early 2003, it suffered
a setback as almost the entire STP team left the institution. Disagreements over payments led to
an initial shortage of human capital. Rather than strengthening an institution that was up and
running, the first years of the project were to some extent focused on recruiting new staff and
training them.

41.     In 2003-June 2006, STP consisted of 20 professionals. In July 2006-December 2010, as
STP became the Project Executing Agency—in addition to its responsibility of the
privatization/liquidation of public enterprises—the institution was down to 10 professionals,
partly as a result of the number of transaction being reduced. Key staff members also left STP at
times when the Project was coming to a end and before any decision was taken on its extension.
STP was thus left with the task of recruiting new staff members at times when it should have
concentrated its effort in completing remaining items. While this drive to keep the administration
17
     Instead, GOM agreed to launch a study for the establishment of a legal and institutional framework for PPPs.

                                                           46
streamlined and nimble may have kept costs low, it also slowed down the divestiture process and
the productivity of management. Successive changes in the institutional framework and the
management team of STP affected the institutional memory of privatization. The retrenchment
and swift reallocation of technical experts within the public administration also led to incomplete
archives.

42.     Fourth, in 1996-2002, when GOM privatized several large SOEs, it invested significant
resources in public communication campaigns. These communication campaigns were
discontinued during the Project as GOM indicated that public communication should remain
outside STP‘s responsibility. GOM did not renew the contract of the STP manager in charge of
public relations and external communication in early 2004. For example, for TELMA and
HASYMA, public communication was made directly by the Minister of Finance and Budget.
The decision to cut investment in public relations was unfortunate given the sensitivity
associated with the transfer of public enterprises to private management. As GOM came under
intense pressure from employees and the public to slow down the divestiture process, GOM lost
time and resources as redundant and unproductive SOEs were kept in the red. Several of the
SOEs that were left in legal limbo are today in very poor shape.

43.    With regards to sustainability of STP, at the time of closing, GOM was still to formulate
its position on the future of the remaining portfolio of public enterprises, including Air
Madagascar, SIRAMA, ADEMA, Sofitrans, Secren, Soavoanio, SBM and JIRAMA. The
contractual arrangements between the Project and the liquidators were terminated in December
2010 but GOM had yet to hone the payment of some creditors as of April 2011.

(ii)   Strengthening the Retraining Program (PASERP):
44.     PASERP is a unit responsible for handling social issues linked to privatization, including
the support for vocational training offered to retrenched workers. It was established by Decree
No. 97/1242 on October 23, 1998, and located under the Ministry of Finance and Budget. The
two main activities of this sub-component were to handle: (i) retrenchment of staff of public
enterprises and ensure that dismissed staff received outstanding payments owed to them
according to the law; and (ii) implementation of the rehabilitation and retraining program of
affected staff. Overall, output indicators were generally achieved despite some outstanding
claims. The activities were concluded in June 2008 and a summary of PASERP‘s achievements
is presented in Table 8.

45.     Some activities were challenging to implement. For example, the railway company had
35 different unions that argued against privatization. Painful negotiations resulted in rather
generous conditions for railway workers. SIRAMA was particularly difficult to
privatize/liquidate. It took several years to complete and retraining workers, many of whom were
analphabets, was not easy. Frequently, the unions had more confidence in PASERP‘s intentions
than did corporate management. Thus, PASERP‘s challenge was to play an honest broker and
bridge the divide between the workers and management. PASERP‘s offer of credit to retrenched
staff who sought to start an own company did not generate many businesses as workers were
suspicious about government loans due to negative experiences in the past when workers who
failed to repay government debt were imprisoned. According to PASERP, an evaluation in
December 2008 of its retraining programs showed mixed results: 30 percent were rated a success

                                                47
 (re-education led to jobs), 25 percent were rated as acceptable (re-education led to some form of
 jobs), and 45 percent were rated a failure (re-education that largely failed to generate jobs).
 Many workers in the latter category preferred to go back to rice cultivation as subsistence
 farmers.

 (iii)    Strengthening the Privatization Trust Fund (PTF):

 46.     PTF was established by Decree No. 96-783 on September 4, 1996. It is a state-owned
 entity that manages minority-owned corporate assets aimed for future divestiture to local citizens
 and employees of recently privatized enterprises. As of December 31, 2010, PTF had not been
 able to play any significant role as it was never allowed to operate by the Government. While it
 did perform a handful of smaller transactions in the early years of the Project (see Table 9), it has
 remained in legal limbo. For example, between 2004 and 2008, PTF had neither a Board of
 Directors nor a Director General. On February 28, 2008, a new Director General was appointed,
 and the entity was finally staffed in the spring of 2008. The new staff was trained and housed in a
 building of the Ministry of Finance and Budget. A detailed action plan was also developed.

 47.     The project supported PTF activities by funding (i) operating expenses (other than staff
 salaries) from February 2008 to March 2009, (ii) office equipment and computers, (iii) staff
 training, and (iv) studies and technical assistance. The project had originally planned to fund: (i)
 the development of PTF‘s Strategic Plan, (ii) the development of implementation manuals, (iii) a
 financial evaluation of targeted companies, (iv) a sectoral analysis of targeted companies in the
 telecom and petroleum sector, (v) the development of a communication plan and training plan,
 (vi) assistance in implementing the strategy and (vii) the procurement of software for this
 purpose. Except for (i), these activities had not been completed at the time of closing.


                                                           48
         48.     As of November 24, 2010, GOM had only transferred a very small proportion of the
         assets to PTF—or MGA 734.1 million out of more than MGA13 billion planned (see Table 9).
         At Project closing, PTF had transferred a fraction of the assets to the target population. Most of
         these assets were transferred in 2003. At the time of closing, PTF had finalized its
         implementation strategy, which was approved by the Ministry of Finance and Budget in early
         2010, and it had begun to prepare in-house activities. However, the budget allocated to PTF for
         the 2011 financial year was insufficient and the Ministry of Finance and Budget did not transfer
         the remaining assets to PTF. The Project therefore suspended its support of PTF.

Component 3: Development of new activities supporting the private sector

49.     The third and final component was a number of activities that were meant to increase
the competitiveness of Malagasy companies. While it was a tiny component in the original
PAD (at US$1.73 million), it became more prominent (increased to US$9.40 million)
following the first restructuring of 2002 as the new Government shifted some of its focus
from privatization to activities meant to strengthen competitiveness. The component was
divided into seven sub-components: (i) trade and investment promotion, (ii) the establishment
of industrial zones, (iii) the establishment of a one stop business facilitation center
(GUIDE/EDBM), (iv) provision of trade insurance (ATI), (v) support of the tourism sector,
(vi) support of a public private dialogue mechanism (CAPE), and (vii) provision of technical
assistance to SMEs.

50.      Overall, this component is rated unsatisfactory due to its limited impact of the
activities on the competitiveness of Malagasy companies. While the outcome of the third sub-
component can be rated as a success, the second, fourth, fifth and seventh sub-components
failed to achieve its objectives, and the first and the sixth sub-components‘ contribution are
difficult to assess. Most of these initiatives were incorporated following the 2002
restructuring and they were seemingly supply/government driven rather than demand/private
sector driven. The Project agreed to incorporate a number of activities requested by the
Government seemingly without a strategic vision as there was significant time pressure to
launch project activities following the Board approval in August 2001. The Project answered
these calls and provided support but the results were limited.

51.      It is impossible to properly measure whether the third component achieved its
objective of increasing the competitiveness of Malagasy companies. It would require
evidence in the form of business surveys conducted at the start of the project and at the
closing of the project. In addition, even if comprehensive data had been collected, the limited
scope of the interventions would arguably have resulted in an almost negligible impact on the
overall private sector. However, the analysis below finds that the transaction costs of starting
a business were cut substantially through the establishment of the one stop business
facilitation centers (EDBMs). While these results must have benefited prospective
entrepreneurs and new investors, they are unlikely to have contributed to the
―competitiveness‖ of existing Malagasy companies.

52.      Figure 13 illustrates how new enterprise creation fluctuated throughout the Project.
The number of new enterprises grew between 1995 and 2000 but dropped significantly in
2001-2002 as the political crisis hit the economy. The same downward trend is evident for
2009 and 2010. The total number of enterprises is dominated by the establishment of one
person enterprises, which fluctuated greatly, and it trended downward following 2004 when
GUIDE came into effect. A closer look at one person limited companies (EURL) and limited
companies (SA) reveal that they expanded substantially starting in 2004. The former category
averaged 98 companies per year in 2001-2005 and 445 companies per year in 2006-2010.
The latter category doubled: from an average of 25 enterprises per year in 2001-2005 to 50
enterprises per year in 2006-2010. The number of limited liability companies (SARL) also
grew in the second half of the 2000s but the impact was less pronounced as the number
dropped in 2009-2010. Thus, in short, formation of various forms of limited and limited
liability enterprises increased following the establishment of EDBMs while the number of
one person enterprises dropped.

53.     Trade and investment promotion. This US$1.15 million sub-component supported
trade and investment promotion activities to restore investor confidence in the country
following the political crisis in 2002. Two main outputs were produced. The first output was
a study presented in June 2004 that recommended the establishment of an international
investment promotion mechanism. It also included a comprehensive plan for the development
of so called ‗business brokers‘. This plan was never implemented partly because of budget
reasons and inconclusive recommendations. The second output was a series of trade and
promotion activities that covered the production of a brochure promoting the country to
investors and in particular the participation of government and private sector representatives
in some seventy events, meetings and international forums held in Africa, America, Asia and
Europe. In return, seven missions of foreign investors visited Madagascar in 2003-2004 but it
is impossible to evaluate the effectiveness of the participation in these trade and investment
promotion events. Figure 3 illustrated how FDI was very low in 2002-2004, before it started
to pick up in 2005.

54.     Export Processing Zone (EPZ) development: The export-oriented garment industry
lost an estimated 80,000 jobs during the political and economical crises of 2002. Supporting
industry to reinvest and rehire workers was therefore a high priority and promoting the
establishment of EPZs became a new sub-component following the restructuring in 2002.
The plan was to provide potential investors with facilitated access to land and infrastructure
and to support the establishment of EPZs in Tsarakofafa Toamasina, the Antananarivo region,
and other provinces. In the end, the Project provided support mainly to the proposed EPZ in
Tsarakofafa Toamasina, as it ran into insurmountable difficulties. This planned EPZ was
strategically located next to a seaport, town, road network and energy supply and its


                                                                                                53
development was part of the Government‘s decentralization and industrialization agenda.
Over the course of the Project, it helped fund: (i) studies related to infrastructure
development, prospective clients and target groups, laws and regulations covering EPZs, land
tenure and contractual options as well as an environmental impact assessment; (ii)
construction of off-site infrastructure worth MGA 1.49 billion to connect the zone with key
utilities, including 80 m3/h of water supply, telecom services with a capacity of 512 lines and
Internet access up to 256 Kbps, and 160 KVA of electricity; (iii) advisory services; (iv)
formalities of land transfer; and (v) property evaluation.18

55.     Notwithstanding US$1.25 million worth of support activities, this investment can be
considered a sunk cost from the Project‘s narrow objective but there is a lot of industrial
activity in the wider area and these activities benefit from the connectivity offered by the
investments. During the early years of the project, the supervision missions devoted
significant time and effort to record the problems, disentangle the issues, propose solutions,
and finance response mechanisms. But governance issues and a long list of challenges
impeded progress. At the mid-term review, the sub-component was rated moderately
satisfactory despite a zero percent occupancy rate. The original aim was an 80 percent
occupancy rate. The rating can only be attributable to a strict focus on output indicators
(offsite infrastructure had been delivered). Over the course of the Project, two property
developers were contracted but none of them invested in the area. In hindsight, the plan for
Toamasina Tsarakofafa was never likely to be successfully implemented. First, the
environmental impact assessment had noted problems of flooding and waste treatment and
some population displacement. Second, the land was not secured. Parts of the area had
already been mortgaged to a property developer called Filatex. Illegal settlers increasingly
occupied the dedicated zone area and the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research had
built a school on some of the property. The rapidly growing number of squatters made it
increasingly difficult to demarcate the area and the contractor hired for this task was chased
away by the new inhabitants. Many of these squatters were seemingly not permanent
inhabitants but rather rent seekers hoping for financial compensation upon removal. The local
Government was too worried to take action about the political implications of forced
removals.

56.     Third, there was no clear demand for the zone as no potential investors had expressed
any formal interest by May 2004. In addition, since 1990, there was another 200 ha zone
leased for 50 years by Far East Group adjacent to the proposed industrial park that was not
operational and had no industrial tenants. Fourth, there were also a number of contractual
irregularities with regards to the concession to the first property developer (GETIM). For
example, there was neither a competitive bidding process nor an economic feasibility study
involved. There was a lack of clarity and detail in the legal underpinning of the zone and
there was no financial due diligence conducted. The public-private partnership model
indicated that this sub-component should have been avoided. For example, in GETIM‘s
business plan shared by the Ministry, the proposed annual rent of the land (US$0.01/ m2) did
not justify the US$1.6 million invested by GOM in infrastructure (water, power line,
telecoms) in the area. Consequently, the challenges were overwhelming and this sub-
component should have been dropped. The mid-term review team identified several of these
shortcomings but stopped short of cancelling this sub-component. Government officials noted
that there was a coordination failure between the Provincial and Central Governments and
that the ministry in charge was uncommitted to this sub-component. They also noted during

     Property valued at MGA 6.5 billion.

Government failed to act decisively.

57.      One Stop Business Facilitation Center (GUIDE, later EDBM): This sub-
component of establishing a single window for investment and enterprise development is
arguably the most important contribution of the third component. Created by Decree No.
2003/938 of September 9, 2003, GUIDE was designed as a single centralized institution
providing the necessary formalities for starting a company and other services required by
investors (visa and work permit issuance, guidance with land titles) as well as promotion
activities. The US$2.77 million worth of support of the Project covered (i) the rehabilitation
of offices and procurement of material and equipment, (ii) operating cost coverage, (iii),
extensive technical assistance, including input in the reforms linked to doing business, and
(iv) training activities.

58.      In May 2006, GOM established the Economic Development Board of Madagascar
(EDBM) to further facilitate entrepreneurship and promote investment. GUIDE was
thereafter integrated into EDBM through Decree No. 2007-396 on May 7, 2007. GOM
offered an entire 10-storey building to EDBM and the Project agreed to rehabilitate this
building to house EDBM. The idea was for EDBM to rent out some of the space to become a
more independent and financially viable institution. The Project also provided technical
assistance to EDBM in its effort to improve the business climate in Madagascar. It achieved
significant results in reducing red tape in the business start up process. Between 2004 and
2009, the number of formalities required for starting a business was reduced from 15 to 2 (see
below). This helped reduce the time it took to start a business from 67 days to 7 days and the
cost from 59 percent of income per capita to 6 percent of income per capita. The Project was
critical in this process as it initiated GUIDE and provided support in EDBM‘s establishment
and reform work.

demolition work had left only three storeys of the Antananarivo EDBM headquarter
inhabitable. The doing business reform program was interrupted following the 2009 political
crisis and Madagascar dropped on the ranking from 134th in 2009 to 140th in 2010. It is
therefore important that GOM takes action to lock in the reforms and achievements and
maintains its efforts in promoting investment. A sustainable funding solution is required to
support EDBM offices located in the provinces.

60.    African Trading Insurance (ATI): Support for this sub-component sought to
provide enhanced security to traders and entrepreneurs. The Project funded the fee required to
join ATI for a total of US$1 million: US$0.1 million in subscription fee and US$0.9 in a
deposit made in 2005. Unfortunately, this insurance mechanism was never used. GOM later
requested additional World Bank funds (US$3 million) to increase the ability of ATI to meet
the demands of investors but this request was not met. In hindsight, the Project team should
have conducted a more thorough demand analysis in order to identify the needs of local
businesses and design the insurance mechanism according to their needs.

61.     Support to the tourism sector: Support for this sub-component (US$0.46 million)
was aimed at providing enhanced administrative support through Regional Tourism Offices
and help prospective investors to get access to land. Potential tourism sites were demarcated
in Anakao, Beheloka and Soalara in the province of Toliara and the Project funded
development plans. The Ministry of Tourism in partnership with EDBM was responsible for
the promotion of these sites to potential investors. The sub-component did not produce any
results and the Project dropped its support in June 2006 as squatters had invaded the
demarcated sites.

62.     Establishing a public private dialogue mechanism (Comité d’Appui au Pilotage
de la relance de l’Entreprise, CAPE): This US$1.25 million sub-component encouraged
public-private dialogue after the political crisis in 2002. CAPE was chaired by the Prime
Minister at the national level. It had an executive secretary and permanent secretariats with
fully equipped offices in several cities, which created a parallel structure to the existing
Chamber of Commerce offices. CAPE hosted two national and several regional meetings, in
particular on trade facilitation, the Finance Act of 2004, the draft Competition Act, and the
draft Companies Act. The private sector side was dominated by large enterprises and
multinationals, which made SMEs lose interest. The largest companies already had the ear of
the authorities and the value of CAPE was diluted.

63.      CAPE funded various studies and SME training activities on the filing of credit
reports, business management, standards and quality. According to the client, the quality of
the consulting reports and studies varied but the recommendations were generally not
implemented, which reduced the private sector‘s interest in this dialogue mechanism. The
sub-component was closed in June 2006 and the impact of this dialogue mechanism is
impossible to measure; in particular since the recommendations and outcome of the dialogue
initiatives were not all recorded and filed. The scope of the activity was vague, which
affected the focus of studies and training courses, and it allowed unnecessary discretion in the
activities. Boosting public-private dialogue was, and remains, important. Working through
existing mechanisms—the Chamber of Commerce is for example represented in all of
Madagascar‘s regions—may have been sufficient although this institution was closed during
the period. CAPE does not have any remaining staff members.

64.     Technical Assistance to SMEs: This sub-component supported the SME Solution
Center (SSC). A contract for provision of technical assistance to SMEs was signed on
September 5, 2005, between the Ministry of Finance and Budget and Business Partners
International (BPI). The contract was for an amount of US$2.0 million and a period of eight
years during which BPI would provide technical assistance to local SMEs. The activities of
BPI started in the middle of 2007 and were adversely affected by the political crisis starting
in 2009. A total of 42 SMEs had benefited from technical assistance at the closing of the
project compared to a target of 75 SMEs. BPI made use of US$475,000, or US$11,300 per

                                              56
SME, in its activities. While the impact of the investment may have been positive for the
beneficiaries—business associations representing SMEs that were consulted during the ICR
mission did indeed give positive feedback—few companies were reached. The overall impact
on the economy must have been limited although individual SMEs may have benefited
greatly. As in some of the other sub-components, a more thorough needs assessment and
design of the support mechanisms could have helped this initiative produce more concrete
results.

                        Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.     No Cost Benefit Analysis or Economic and Financial Analysis were prepared at the
Project design stage. The PAD noted that the support provided under the project was to
“serve as a catalyst to create an environment sufficiently conducive to attract first class
management and technology know-how, and significant capital investments”. These
investments were expected to bring considerable economic benefits that could be measured in
terms of: (i) increased output from new entrants and privatized entities; (ii) factor cost
savings resulting from competition between operators and better managed companies; (iii)
additional income from net job creation; and (iv) consumer surplus. As the project support
was considered catalytic, the above mentioned benefits were not considered a direct result of
the project. This ICR did not attempt to quantify the gains given the lack of starting point
estimates to measure efficiency against.

2.     While the cost of the interventions were well defined at project preparation and well
accounted for at project closing, the prospective or realized benefits of the new institutional
and regulatory capacity are linked to a host of environmental, governance, social, and
economic factors. The intangible non-economic gains will be substantial in the long run.
Table 12 provides an overview of both tangible and intangible gains and positive outcomes
from the Project activities.

3.       The interventions in the Project were closely associated with PATESP, which makes
it difficult to disentangle the income and expenditure and accrue them to the activities of the
two projects over time. For example, several of the transactions in the privatization process
were initiated and partly executed in PATESP and the Project finalized this process. The
same holds for the institutional capacity building interventions of regulators: these regulatory
agencies had already been established in PATESP but were admittedly weak and
considerably strengthened in the Project. Thus, the costs and benefits are linked to two
generations of projects.

4.      Annex 1 presents a cost breakdown by component and sub-component. It reveals that
the initial estimates in the PAD for supporting OMERT and OMH were greater than
necessary, in particular for OMERT. The first component consumed only 36 percent of the
resources initially allocated. The second component, of privatization implementation, made
use of 79 percent of the appraised funds. For privatization transactions, the Project made use
of 69 percent of appraised funds, which reflects the fact that the new Government lowered the
ambition and removed SOEs from the privatization list. Some of the non-performing sub-
components such as PTF and the development of EPZs did not generate any return on
investment but disbursement was reduced and eventually stopped as there were few signs of
progress.

5.      According to STP, in 1999-2010, the total cost of the privatization process was MGA
107.8 billion and the total income was MGA 118.5 billion—resulting in a small but positive
balance of MGA 10.7 billion. Thus, the overall direct financial return on investment of the
Government‘s privatization and liquidation agenda was very limited indeed. By far the
largest cost component in this process was compensation to retrenched employees (MGA 77
billion). Of the total income, roughly MGA 67.5 billion was generated during the Project‘s
effectiveness, in 2003-2010, and the cost was an estimated MGA 18.2 billion (see Annex 6).
The second tranche of the TELMA privatization generated a large surplus in 2004 (see Annex
2). The liquidations of ROSO, SINPA and SOMACODIS generated large surpluses.

                                              58
6.      A net present value (NPV) calculation is possible for the privatization and liquidation
process. First, assume that expenditures and incomes were all realized at the year when the
income was recorded in Annex 6. Second, assume that expenditures and incomes for public
enterprises that were partial or suspended (the lower half of Annex 6) were recorded evenly
over the years 2008-2010, then the net present value for the privatization and liquidation
process starting in 2003 was:

            MGA 44.5 billion for a discount rate of 5 percent.
            MGA 39.0 billion for a discount rate of 10 percent.
            MGA 33.9 billion for a discount rate of 15 percent.

7.      However, these calculations do not take into account US$3.9 million of expenditures
of the Privatization Secretariat (STP). Thus, the NPVs above only reflect a limited set of
direct expenditures but all the direct income generated from the process.

8.      The privatization of these companies did attract new investments but data are not
readily available. Some of the companies were insolvent pre-privatization and new
investment would most likely have been wasted without new management. Post-privatization
and new investment, companies in for example the telecom sector and petroleum sector
upgraded technology, processes and management, which led to revenue growth and taxable
income, a larger consumer surplus, etc. Data on corporate revenues pre- and post-
liberalization were not accessible but it is a reasonable assumption that the long-term benefits
of equipping these companies with a new set of performance-based incentives would be
substantial.

                                       Table 12. Gains from the Project

 Activity                         Gains / outcomes
 Enhanced regulatory                 More stringent environmental standards in the energy sector
 capacity                            Higher quality standards enjoyed by consumers in telecom and energy
 Liquidation of public               Assets tied up in loss making enterprises put to more productive private use
 enterprises                         Government resources saved from cuts in subsidies
 Privatization of state-owned        Enhanced competition and innovation promotion
 enterprises (i.e. large public      Government income from the sale of assets and higher potential tax income
 enterprises)                        New private investment to enhance accessibility and reliability
                                     Government resources saved from cuts in subsidies
 Establishment of the One            Reduction in transaction cost at entry
 Stop Shop and other new             Reduction in information costs
 PSD activities                      Enhanced visibility and investment promotion

9.      Implementation efficiency was negatively affected by the political crises, which
produced new administrations, of which the first was significantly less committed to the
privatization process. According to STP estimates, government indecision on privatization
led to MGA 56 billion spent on studies and legal fees for the eight SOEs that were never
privatized (see Component 3 in Annex 2). While the Project only covered a modest
proportion of these expenditures, and some of these investments may have been value for the
companies at large, they did not help achieve the objectives that they were meant to do. In
conclusion, at least for component 2, implementation efficiency was seemingly low given the
lack of government commitment to execute the privatization process.



                                                         59
10.     Finally, there were significant implementation delays that to a large extent were
caused by the two political crises, the lack of government commitment to the privatization
agenda, and slow payments of arrears to creditors (by Government) and consultants (by PIU).
More than eight years passed between project effectiveness and project closing. An earlier
closing date, as originally planned, would have allowed the Government and the World Bank
to assess the cost and benefits of the achievements, and design a new follow up Project that
would better have reflected the Government‘s priorities and start without the legacy of the
original Project.

1.     A roundtable discussion with a small group of Malagasy investors was organized
during the November 2010 ICR mission. The focus of the discussion was to get a better
understanding of how the privatization and liquidation process had been received by local
investors—in particular with regards to transparency, openness and fairness.

2.       The investors had all taken part in the divestiture process and the group echoed the
messages of STP that most of the public assets were in bad shape. A lack of competition, a
poor business environment and legal uncertainties were their main concerns as business
leaders. Some public assets were split up according to their regional locations, which
facilitated participation in the bidding process by smaller domestic investors. The main initial
concern of the investors was their negative experiences of the liquidation and privatization
process first undertaken in 1996. They argued that the Government had sold some assets,
collected the money, but then refused to cede control of the assets. While the Government has
hitherto failed to pay several creditors of liquidated companies, the roundtable participants
did not have the same negative experience in the 2000s.

3.     The group argued that the sale of assets had been sufficiently open, transparent and
equitable. Assets were advertised in journals and prospective investors could buy the bidding
documents for a low price. While the divestiture process in the 1990s had been awarded to
the highest bidder in a single round of bidding, the 2000s divestiture process was organized
as an auction. This revenue maximizing mechanism was much disliked by the investors as it
lowered their chances to strike bargains—although acquired assets had to be held for a
minimum of two years by the new owner. They also complained about the 20 percent VAT
that was collected on the winning bids. It was noted that there was some legal uncertainties
associated with the implementation of the privatization law but it had not stopped the process.

4.      The group also argued that the committee established by STP and the Government
had followed rules ―on the dot‖ in the auctions they had participated in: envelopes were
opened in the public and offers could be rejected if the bidder failed to comply with all
conditions. They noted that the President had taken part in the auctioning of one asset and all
competing bids had been rejected due to provision of incomplete information. There were
complaints related to the Government‘s failure to live up to some of its promises to clear all
outstanding arrears as one investor mentioned that she had had to pay tax arrears to the local
tax office in Mahajanga Province for a property she had acquired in an auction (yet it was not
clear as to whether there was any fault of the Government in this case). There were also some
concerns raised that some of these cases had been properly settled by the authorities while
others remained open.

5.     Another investor has a bad experience in acquiring land previously held by SOLIMA.
Following the purchase, he learnt that the company lacked proper title to parts of the land,
which put the property in legal limbo, and the situation was made worse due to the perceived
corruptibility of the land titling office. This was apparently not the only situation where STP
auctioned land without proper title. In addition, the investors noted that the divestiture of
SOLIMA had been perceived as less transparent than the other assets. It was unclear,
however, whether these issues occurred in PATESP or PSDP2.

6.    Finally, the roundtable participants argued that the divestiture process could be
improved in the future if: (i) remaining legal uncertainties about the implementation law were

                                              64
removed, (ii) the application of rules and tax arrears was more consistent, and (iii) political
involvement and conflicts of interest were tackled. Everybody agreed that political ownership
and meddling had destroyed too many national assets.

           Annex 7. Summary of Borrower’s ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The report: “Contribution de l’état Malgache au Rapport de Fin d’exécution et de Résultat du
  PDSP II Prépare par la Banque Mondiale”, was submitted to the ICR author on May 10,
                                           2011.

Le PDSP II ou « Deuxième Projet de Développement du Secteur Privé » (ci-après le « Projet »)
est le prolongement du PATESP ou Projet d‘Appui Technique au Secteur Privé. Signé en octobre
2001, il est entré en vigueur au mois de novembre 2002. Le Projet vise à permettre au
Gouvernement de Madagascar (i) d'améliorer l'accès aux principaux services publics, d'en
accroître la fiabilité et d'en réduire le coût et (ii) de stimuler la compétitivité des entreprises
malgaches. Bien que l‘Accord de Crédit ait été amendé 7 fois, et les activités revues et corrigées
à plusieurs reprises, les objectifs du Projet sont restés les mêmes.

Mis en oeuvre entre deux crises socio politiques majeures, celle de 2002 et celle de 2009, le
Projet a donné des résultats raisonnablement satisfaisants. Les principales réalisations gravitent
autour des activités liées aux indicateurs suivants : augmentation des investissements privés dans
les secteurs ciblés, amélioration de l‘accès à des services fiables, abordables et de qualité dans le
secteur des télécommunications. L‘état d‘avancement du programme de liquidation est
également très appréciable. Les principales lacunes relevées concernent tant la structure de mise
en oeuvre que les modalités d‘exécution de certaines activités du Projet.

Si dans sa conception initiale, le Projet devait être sous la tutelle d‘un Ministère unique en charge
du développement du secteur privé et de la privatisation, à l‘issue de la crise politique de 2002 ce
Ministère a été dissout et ses attributions réparties entre celui chargé des Finances pour la
privatisation, et celui chargé de l‘Industrie et du Commerce pour le développement du secteur
privé. Ce changement institutionnel a impacté l‘opérationnalisation du Projet, dans la mesure où
les deux agences d‘exécution (ci-après les « AGEX ») ont dû entretenir une relation directe avec
leur Ministère de tutelle respectif, tandis que l‘Unité de Coordination du Projet a vu son rôle
devenir superflu. La structure d‘exécution, devenue complexe et inadaptée, n‘a toutefois été
modifiée qu‘à la suite de la restructuration de 2006.

Concernant l‘exécution du Projet, un certain nombre d‘activités n‘a pu être mené à terme suite à
la décision de la Banque Mondiale de suspendre son financement du fait de la crise
sociopolitique de 2009 : ces activités concernent aussi bien des activités de liquidation
d‘entreprises que relevant du développement du secteur privé.

Des activités, notamment dans la Composante Secteur Privé, n‘ont abouti faute de meilleure
préparation et de concertation entre l‘Administration et les responsables du Projet. L‘échec dans
la mise en place « l‘Export Processing Zone » (EPZ) de Tsarakofafa malgré les investissements
réalisés dans les infrastructures (eau, électricité, téléphone), en est le cas le plus marquant. De
même, aucune entreprise malgache n‘a pu réellement tirer profit de l‘adhésion de Madagascar à
l‘African Trading Insurance (ATI).

Concernant la performance du Projet, le Programme de Désengagement des principales
entreprises publiques a été appréciable malgré la suspension du processus de privatisation dans le


                                                 69
secteur aérien (cas d‘Air Madagascar et d‘ADEMA) ou la tergiversation de l‘Etat sur le cas de la
SIRAMA. Les résultats dans le cadre du volet développement du secteur privé, sont d‘un autre
côté plus mitigés. Hormis les réalisations dans le cadre de l‘amélioration des indicateurs doing
business, les activités n‘ont pas abouti à des avancées notables. D‘autres réalisations acquises en
cours de projet ont été perdues du fait de la crise de 2009 (AGOA, confiance des investisseurs,
qualité de l‘environnement des affaires, etc.).

1. Analyses et commentaires par composante :

1- Composante 1 : Renforcement des capacités des organes de réglementation.
a- Secteur Pétrolier
Les interventions dans le secteur pétrolier ont permis de libéraliser le secteur et de garantir la
fourniture des produits pétroliers aux consommateurs. Suite à la privatisation de la SOLIMA en
2003, la Loi n° 2004-003 a été sortie en juin 2004 portant sur la libéralisation du secteur
pétrolier. Cette loi a été suivie par un Décret d‘application n° 2004-669 la même année. La vérité
des prix des produits pétroliers à la pompe a pu ensuite être appliquée. Un audit environnemental
a été réalisé en 2005, et a abouti à l‘élaboration d‘un plan d‘action de mise en place des mesures
de protection et mitigation des risques, la remise aux normes des 79% des stations-services dans
l‘île. Le renforcement des capacités des agents de l‘Office Malgache des Hydrocarbures (OMH),
dans la formulation des règlements techniques et économiques, et de surveillance des risques
environnementaux, n‘a pas été effectué faute de budget, suite à l‘amendement du projet.

b- Secteur Télécommunication
Des activités ont été prévues dans ce secteur, mais elles ont été amendées sans avoir jamais été
mises en oeuvre. Il s‘agit des activités de renforcement de capacités des agents de l‘Office
Malgache d‘Etudes et de Régulation des Télécommunications (OMERT), et la gestion de
fréquence. Seule la téléphonie rurale a pu être lancée, mais sa coordination a été pilotée par l‘ex-
Direction Générale de la Technologie d‘Information et de Communication du Ministère chargé
de la Télécommunication, au lieu de l‘OMERT.

2- Composante 2 : Mise en oeuvre des transactions de privatisation

a- Secrétariat Technique à la Privatisation STP
Le STP a joué un rôle important dans la gestion des opérations de privatisation des entreprises
publiques. Malgré la complexité du processus de privatisation, le STP a pu atteindre plus de 72
% des opérations de privatisations. Le renforcement des capacités de l‘équipe (recrutements,
formations) a également beaucoup contribué à cette performance. Le STP a repris la coordination
après la suppression de l‘Unité de Coordination du Projet (UCP) à partir de 2006. Il a pu mener à
terme le Projet, même si sa responsabilité était non négligeable, eu égard aux nombreux dossiers
qu‘il avait à traiter dans la privatisation. Une étude stratégique sur la réorientation et la
réorganisation du cadre institutionnel du désengagement de l‘Etat vers le Partenariat Public Privé
(PPP) a été élaborée par le STP en 2004. Le PPP a pour avantage de favoriser le financement des
investissements et la prise en charge de la gestion par le secteur privé sans recourir au transfert
de la propriété des actifs de l‘Etat.




                                                70
Un projet de loi sur le Partenariat Public Privé (PPP) a été établi en 2008 sur financement de la
Banque Africaine de Développement à travers le Projet de Réforme Institutionnelle pour la
Bonne Gouvernance (PRIBG), mais elle n‘a pas encore été adoptée à ce jour. Elle a déjà été
soumise au Comité de Réflexion sur le Droit des Affaires (CRDA) pour analyse et discussion
avant sa soumission auprès de l‘Assemblée Nationale et le Sénat.

Suite à la crise de 2009 et à la décision de la Banque Mondiale de suspendre ses activités, tous
les contrats des liquidateurs (qui sont tous des experts-comptables et/ou juristes ayant travaillé
sur plusieurs dossiers de liquidation des entreprises) ont été résiliés, mais les actes juridiques de
nomination n‘ont pas encore été dénoncés.

Concernant les processus de liquidation n‘ayant pas abouti, la principale recommandation est de
reprendre les mêmes liquidateurs. En effet, il sera ardu pour de nouveaux liquidateurs
d‘apprendre et de maîtriser l‘historique des dossiers, à cause de leur volume et de leur
complexité, alors que les anciens liquidateurs les maîtrisent déjà, et détiennent les pièces
originales des opérations de liquidation déjà réalisées. De ce fait, ils en constituent la mémoire
institutionnelle incontournable. Enfin, le cas du STP a permis de signaler qu‘il est important
d‘inclure ou d‘associer, dans les structures de mise en oeuvre des projets, des fonctionnaires afin
de permettre le maintien d‘une mémoire institutionnelle et l‘appropriation des dossiers par
l‘Administration à la fin desdits projets. Aujourd‘hui, en cas de clôture du STP, aucune branche
de l‘Administration ne sera en mesure d‘assurer un relais efficace, que ce soit pour les opérations
de désengagement ou les opérations de liquidation.

b- Programme d’Action Sociale et Economique pour la Réinsertion Professionnelle
(PASERP)
Le rôle du PASERP porte sur le traitement des agents licenciés et leur accompagnement en vue
de leur réinsertion professionnelle. A la clôture de ses activités en juin 2008, le PASERP a formé
4 277 travailleurs dans la démarche de réinsertion professionnelle, ce qui a abouti à
l‘établissement de 3 530 travailleurs déflatés en entreprise. Dans sa mise en oeuvre, le projet a
rencontré des problèmes relatifs au volet social. Malgré les activités de communication et de
sensibilisation, ainsi que l‘accompagnement des agents déflatés, ces derniers ont effectivement
suivi les formations dispensées dans le cadre du programme, mais les fonds « coup de pouce »
qui leur ont été octroyés, ont plutôt été dépensés dans des achats matériels, n‘ayant rien à voir
avec les activités qu‘ils auraient dû faire. Les principales leçons à tirer sont :
     La mise en oeuvre d‘un programme de réinsertion professionnelle ne peut être confiée
        uniquement à une structure de Projet. Les collectivités locales et les Ministères devraient
        être impliqués activement dans leur responsabilité respective (résolution des problèmes
        fonciers, sociaux, infrastructures…), et s‘approprier la démarche.
     Les institutions de micro-finance n‘ont pas pu répondre aux besoins des personnes
        établies en entreprise. De ce fait, ces dernières ont eu recours aux usuriers, plus flexibles
        et relativement moins contraignants.
     Tout programme de réinsertion professionnelle doit aller de pair avec un programme de
        réinsertion sociale pour accompagner les personnes dans leur réintégration dans leur
        communauté.




                                                 71
c- Fonds de Portage et de Privatisation (FPP)
Aucune des activités initialement prévues n‘a été menée à terme, en raison du retard important
dans la mise en place de la structure de gestion, et de l‘arrêt du financement de la Banque
Mondiale, lequel est intervenu quelques temps après la mise en place du FPP. Les activités
réalisées ont plutôt porté sur la dotation en matériel et équipements et l‘appui au budget de
fonctionnement hors salaire du FPP, à compter de la mise en place de la nouvelle structure de
gestion.

Il est toutefois à noter que le soutien (technique et documentaire) du Projet, a grandement facilité
le démarrage du FPP. En effet, le STP, structure financée par le Projet, a assuré la mémoire
institutionnelle de la structure. Les travaux d‘archives réalisés par le STP, depuis 2003, ont été
utilisés pour appuyer le FPP. Par ailleurs, le STP avait anticipé le programme de transfert des
actions des entreprises vendues, et avait déjà élaboré les termes de références des différentes
prestations de service relatives à la mise en oeuvre du Programme de Désengagement de l‘Etat.

Bien que les ressources financières aient été limitées, et la mise en place du FPP basée sur des
travaux d‘archives, la structure a pu démarrer et fonctionner. Jusqu‘à maintenant (fin de
l‘exercice 2010), 37,52 % des actions des entreprises privatisées ont pu être transférées au FPP.
Il s‘agit d‘actions provenant de la privatisation réalisée avant 2005, mais aucune d‘elles n‘a été
offerte aux petits investisseurs nationaux à cause du changement de stratégie. En effet, une
stratégie consistant en l‘achat et la vente des actions des entreprises à privatiser au public a été
adoptée. Cette stratégie, déjà validée par le Ministère des Finances et du Budget en début 2010,
est encore dans sa phase de mise en place.

3- Composante 3 : Elaboration de nouvelles activités d’appui au secteur privé.

a- Guichet Unique des Investissement et de Développement des Entreprises (GUIDE)
Le guichet unique a pour mission de faciliter les procédures de création d‘entreprises, ceci afin
de dynamiser le secteur privé, et de favoriser l‘émergence des entreprises ainsi que d‘assurer la
promotion des Investissements Directs Etrangers. Suite à la restructuration du Projet, l‘Etat a
créé une nouvelle structure dénommée Economic Development Board of Madagascar, laquelle a
intégré toutes les activités du guichet unique en son sein. Le GUIDE a rencontré les problèmes
suivants :
     Le traitement inégal du personnel au sein de la structure a démotivé les fonctionnaires
        affectés par les différents Ministères pour le traitement des dossiers. La présence des
        consultants, qui sont souvent mieux payés que les fonctionnaires dans la structure a
        entraîné un rythme de travail à deux vitesses.
     Le fonctionnement de la structure a été financé par le Projet, alors qu‘elle aurait sûrement
        pu se créer des ressources financières par le biais de ses activités, pour couvrir son propre
        fonctionnement.

Etant donné l‘importance d‘une telle structure dans la dynamisation du secteur privé, il est
recommandé de réfléchir sur les mesures de pérennisation de la structure et des acquis du Projet,
en créant des services payants pour financer le fonctionnement de la structure. Les fonctionnaires
détachés par l‘Administration devraient être motivés à travers plus de formations et
d‘indemnités… pour soutenir la performance de toute l‘équipe. Il apparaît tout aussi nécessaire

                                                 72
de garder les personnes affectées par l‘Administration publique au sein de la structure pour une
réelle continuité des activités entamées.

b- Export Processing Zone (EPZ)
L‘Export Processing Zone avait pour but de créer une zone industrielle dédiée sur un terrain
aménagé à Tsarakofafa, dans la province de Toamasina. Les activités réalisées ont consisté en la
mise en place d‘infrastructures d‘un coût total de 1,5 milliard Ariary ou 1 million USD (eau,
électricité et télécommunication), pour faciliter l‘installation des sociétés dans la zone. La société
détentrice du bail emphytéotique s‘était engagée en septembre 2008, à travers la signature d‘un
Protocole d‘Accord avec l‘Etat, à mener des activités de développement sur le site. Mais aucune
viabilisation n‘a été réalisée depuis cette date. Selon le rapport de supervision de la Banque
Mondiale en 2010, la zone est actuellement squattérisée dans sa quasi-totalité.

Une démarche visant à la sécurisation de la zone, à travers des études préliminaires sur la
situation juridique et foncière et le transfert du titre de propriété à l‘Etat, aurait dû précéder le
lancement des activités d‘installation des infrastructures. Dans le cas de ce projet, une étude
relative au ciblage des entreprises et usines à implanter dans le site a été menée en 2004, à l‘issue
de laquelle l‘agroalimentaire a été proposé comme secteur d‘activité de base. L‘Etat cherche
aujourd‘hui une alternative pour rentabiliser les infrastructures déjà mises en place dans la zone.
La Société de Gestion du Port Autonome de Toamasina (SPAT) s‘est déjà engagée à annuler
tous les titres de propriété du site et à enlever tous les squatters qui s‘y sont installés.

c- Investissements Directs Etrangers (IDE)
Cette activité consiste en la promotion de Madagascar au niveau international pour inciter les
opérateurs internationaux à investir dans le pays. Le Projet a surtout financé les déplacements et
la participation de la délégation malgache constituée par des opérateurs privés et des
responsables de l‘Administration, dans des événements comme les foires, les tables rondes, les
road shows. Ces activités ont été menées de manière ponctuelle, et étalées sur toute la durée du
projet, en fonction des manifestations et rencontres existantes, sans planification au préalable.
Néanmoins, un des points forts de cette activité a été l‘éligibilité de Madagascar à l‘African
Growth Opportunity Act (AGOA). Ces missions ont par ailleurs favorisé le rapprochement entre
le secteur privé et l‘Administration.

Afin d‘en tirer les meilleurs avantages, il serait indiqué de réaliser les actions de marketing et de
promotion avec des mesures d‘accompagnement pour le suivi des actions de promotion et de
marketing. Les activités de promotion et de communication nécessitent une bonne organisation
et de planification de la part d‘une cellule de coordination (entité qui n‘a pas été mise en place
par le Ministère).

d- Comité d’appui au pilotage de la relance de l’entreprise (CAPE)
Le CAPE est une structure créée pour redynamiser le secteur privé après la crise sociopolitique
de 2002. Il s‘agit d‘une plateforme de dialogue entre le secteur privé et les autorités de l‘Etat
pour la relance économique. Il vise à instaurer un climat de confiance pour attirer les
Investissements Directs Etrangers d‘une part, et pour impliquer le secteur privé dans les
orientations de la politique de développement malgache, d‘autre part. Le volet CAPE a été
clôturé en 2006.


                                                 73
Des études sur différents domaines du secteur privé (fiscalité du tourisme, le financement des
Petites et Moyennes Entreprises ou PME…) et des formations transversales (montage de dossiers
crédit, gestion d‘entreprise, normes et qualité) pour les PME ont été réalisées. Le secteur privé a
également pu participer à l‘établissement de la loi de Finances et l‘élaboration des textes
juridiques (loi sur la concurrence, loi sur les sociétés). Le dialogue a permis d‘adopter 49
mesures de facilitation douanières. Malgré cela, le CAPE a été plus orienté vers le financement
des études que dans la gestion d‘une plateforme d‘échange et de concertation entre le secteur
privé et le secteur public. Le secteur privé a plutôt privilégié la concertation directe avec les
dirigeants (Présidence, membres du Gouvernement). D‘autant plus que le Secrétaire Exécutif du
CAPE était perçu par certains groupements du secteur privé comme étant trop proche d‘un
groupement du secteur privé, dont il occupait la vice-présidence.

A la clôture de cette composante, les acquis (études, matériels…) auraient dû être capitalisés
(base des données) et valorisés par une autre structure comme la Chambre de commerce, qui
constitue déjà une plateforme de dialogue et de concertation pour tous les opérateurs privés. Le
renforcement de la Chambre de commerce, au lieu de créer une nouvelle structure, aurait été plus
rentable et efficace puisqu‘il s‘agit d‘une structure pérenne.

e- African Trade Insurance (ATI)
L‘ATI est une agence d‘assurances permettant la couverture des risques politiques, outre ceux
sur les transactions courantes. Cette entité devait sécuriser les investissements mais la
contribution financière versée par l‘Etat Malgache n‘a pas été suffisante. Sur les nombreux
dossiers déposés, aucune entreprise à Madagascar n‘a bénéficié d‘une garantie de la part de
l‘ATI. L‘échec dans le cadre de cette activité aurait pu être pallié par une étude de marché
préalable. Cette démarche aurait pu déterminer la demande d‘un tel produit et la taille des
investissements à assurer avant le lancement. Par ailleurs, il aurait été nécessaire de réaliser une
campagne d‘information et de communication auprès des opérateurs privés sur les objectifs, la
nature des services offerts et les démarches à adopter pour en bénéficier.

f- Business Partners International (BPI)
Cette sous-composante a été créée suite à l‘accord signé entre l‘Etat et Business Partners
International en 2005. Elle participe aux activités du Centre de Solution Petites et Moyennes
Entreprises de la Société Financière Internationale (SFI). La participation de l‘Etat Malgache
porte sur l‘assistance technique aux PME bénéficiaires des crédits octroyés, et le BPI sur le fonds
d‘investissement (10 millions USD) pour les PME à Madagascar. A la clôture du Projet, 53
PMEs ont pu bénéficier de l‘assistance technique.

Sur les 2 millions USD affectés à l‘assistance technique, un peu moins de 200 000 USD ont pu
être utilisés. La crise sociopolitique qui a débuté en janvier 2009, a en effet eu un impact
important sur l‘économie malgache, et par conséquent sur l‘environnement des affaires à
Madagascar. Ainsi, BPI a décidé de clôturer prématurément toutes les activités du fonds
d‘investissement et du fonds d‘assistance technique à Madagascar en juin 2010, si la date de
clôture prévue est en 2013. Une part importante, de 1 525 000 USD, n‘a pas été utilisée et a été
remboursée par le BPI dans le compte du Projet à Washington, en décembre 2010.

g- Tourisme
La sous-composante Tourisme a été clôturée en 2006. Elle avait pour objectif de développer une
Réserve Foncière Touristique (RFT) à Anakao, Beheloka et Soalara dans la province de Tuléar.
Les sites touristiques ont été délimités et les travaux de bornage ont été effectués par le Ministère
du Tourisme pour sécuriser les différents sites. Les plans d‘aménagement sont déjà élaborés, et le
Ministère du Tourisme en partenariat avec l‘EDBM ont été chargés de la promotion des sites
auprès des investisseurs potentiels. Suite à la crise sociopolitique, aucune promotion de ces sites
n‘a encore été démarré jusqu‘à ce jour, selon l‘EDBM. Des habitants ont alors commencé à
s‘installer dans la réserve, ce qui aura présenté un surcoût en terme de déplacement et de
régularisation du volet social à la reprise de l‘activité. Il est recommandé à l‘Etat, notamment au
Ministère de tutelle et les autorités locales, de procéder à la sécurisation (juridique, physique) de
ces sites afin de contenir le surcoût dans la relance de cette activité.

2. Bilan des réalisations

2.1. Impact du Projet :
Les principaux indicateurs d‘impact du Projet relatifs à ses activités sont l‘augmentation des
investissements privés dans les secteurs ciblés et l‘amélioration de l‘accès à des services fiables,
abordables et de qualité dans chaque secteur. Augmentation des Investissements Directs
Etrangers Concernant les investissements privés dans les secteurs visés, nous avons enregistré
778 millions USD d‘investissements privés en 2007 contre 95 millions USD en 2004, mais avec
un rapport IDE/PIB de 6,4 % en 2009 contre 10,4% en 2007. Cette augmentation provient en
grande partie des grands projets miniers, mais elle démontre aussi le dynamisme du secteur privé
et l‘effort du Gouvernement dans l‘amélioration de l‘environnement des affaires pour sécuriser
les investissements. Si l‘on ne tient pas compte des investissements dans le secteur minier et des
recettes de la privatisation, la part des investissements se retrouve réduite et le taux IDE/PIB
devient 4,2% en 2007 et 1,1 % en 2009. Il est toutefois difficile d‘apprécier la contribution du
Projet dans le résultat d‘ensemble.

Amélioration de l’accès aux services
L‘analyse s‘est portée sur le secteur des télécommunications où dans l‘ensemble les résultats
sont satisfaisants.
i) le nombre d‘abonnés d‘internet a augmenté de 15 000 abonnés en 2003 à 26 692 abonnés en
2009,
ii) le taux d‘accès aux lignes téléphoniques (fixe et mobile) a connu une augmentation de 31,6%
en 2009 à la fin du projet,
iii) Si l‘objectif de cet indicateur est d‘avoir un « niveau de tarif égal au plus à fin 2006 à la
moyenne appliquée par les opérateurs de la région et pour lesquels la concurrence est équivalente
à celle existante à Madagascar », le niveau de tarif moyen local (mobile local) est passé de 0,58
USD par 3 min (Tarif moyen appliqué par les opérateurs dans la région2 était de 0,51USD/3
min) en 2003 à 0,14 USD par 3 min en 2009, (Tarif moyen appliqué par les opérateurs dans la
région est de 0,21 USD/3 min).

Il a été difficile de collecter le nombre des usagers d‘internet dans la mesure où l‘OMERT ne
dispose pas de ces données. Néanmoins, le nombre d‘abonnés d‘internet a augmenté de 56%
entre 2003 et 2009. L‘amélioration de l‘accès aux services de télécommunications s‘est


                                                 75
également traduite par l‘augmentation du taux d‘accès aux lignes téléphoniques (fixe et mobile)
de 31,6% à la fin du Projet, avec un tarif 33% (en 2009) moins cher que le tarif moyen appliqué
par les opérateurs dans les pays comparateurs (Togo, Sénégal, Maurice et Maroc).

2.2. Performance du Projet :
Programme de désengagement des principales entreprises publiques :
Concernant la performance du Projet dans le domaine de la privatisation, la situation des 54
entreprises publiques inscrites dans le programme de désengagement de l‘Etat à la clôture de
celui-ci se présente comme suit : 6 privatisations réalisées, 8 privatisations non réalisées, 21
liquidations effectuées, 12 liquidations en attente du paiement des créanciers par l‘Etat et 7
liquidations suspendues par des problèmes contentieux et fonciers.

Bien que le programme n‘ait pas été mené à terme, les résultats obtenus sont satisfaisants,
notamment dans le traitement des dossiers des entreprises à liquider. Les réalisations en matière
de privatisation d‘entreprises ont par ailleurs permis de redynamiser d‘une manière significative
les secteurs concernés (cas notamment des secteurs des Télécommunications et de
l‘Hydrocarbure). Par contre, la suspension du processus sur les entreprises du secteur aérien (Air
Madagascar et ADEMA) continue d‘affecter la compétitivité de l‘économie malgache et le
développement du secteur du Tourisme. Les différents atermoiements, sur le cas de la SIRAMA,
ont eu des conséquences des plus négatives avec l‘effondrement de la production nationale de
sucre et la perte de plusieurs milliers d‘emplois.

Depuis la clôture des transactions, plusieurs critiques sont entendues sur la pertinence de la
privatisation, la transparence du processus ou les modalités de transfert de certaines entreprises
publiques au secteur privé, cas notamment de TELMA, MADARAIL et HASYMA. Cela relève
l‘importance de la communication de l‘Etat envers le public, la société civile et le monde
politique, tout au long du programme de privatisation dans le but de présenter la situation de
départ, les objectifs de la réforme, les procédures et les modalités de mise en oeuvre, les
conditions de la vente et les résultats obtenus.

Développement du secteur privé
Au niveau du Secteur Privé, la performance du Projet est résumée par les indicateurs de résultats
suivants:
    - 2 étapes et 7 jours pour créer une entreprise auprès de l‘EDBM. Ceci concerne
       Antananarivo ;
    - Nombre d‘entreprises créées :          2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 TOTAL
                Antananarivo         882     1,115 1,171 1,138 909        5,218
                Antennes                             856   329     92
    - Taux d‘occupation de la Zone Industrielle : 0%. Activité suspendue.
    - Selon le site de ATI, aucune entreprise malgache n‘a bénéficié de la garantie ATI.
    - 37 PME ont bénéficié du fonds d‘investissements ; 53 PME ayant bénéficié de
       l‘assistance technique ; 319 emplois créés et 1108 emplois soutenus.

Le guichet unique a été intégré au sein de l‘Economic Development Board of Madagascar après
la restructuration en 2006. Les activités ont été ainsi reprises par cette nouvelle institution. Les
étapes et la durée du traitement des dossiers pour la création de l‘entreprise ont été très allégées.


                                                 76
Au début du Projet, il a fallu passer par 17 étapes pour 157 jours contre 2 étapes pour 7 jours lors
et après le Projet. Les différentes démarches peuvent être effectuées à un seul endroit. Tout cela a
insufflé un vent nouveau à l‘économie malgache boostée par l‘augmentation du nombre
d‘entreprises créées et qui est resté stable depuis 2005. Les résultats dans le cadre de ce volet
sont également mitigés. Hormis les réalisations dans le cadre de l‘amélioration des indicateurs
doing business, les activités n‘ont pas abouti à des avancées notables.

3. Performance de la Banque Mondiale
L‘équipe de la Banque Mondiale s‘est toujours montrée disponible pour le Gouvernement et
l‘équipe du Projet. Elle a prodigué des conseils techniques d‘importance et a démontré son
soutien dans sa flexibilité et sa capacité d‘adaptation, au vu des modifications fréquentes du
contexte socio-économique et des priorités du Gouvernement. Les discussions entre
l‘emprunteur (Ministères) et le bailleur ont permis d‘instaurer une confiance réciproque et une
bonne relation. Dans le cadre de ces discussions, les structures de gestion du Projet n‘y ont pas
toujours été associées. Les informations sur les décisions et les orientations leur sont parvenues
par l‘intermédiaire de la Banque Mondiale, mais non pas par leur hiérarchie respective.

4. Performance du Gouvernement
De manière globale, les résultats du Projet sont satisfaisants. Toutefois, un grand nombre
d‘activités, dont notamment au niveau de la composante développement du secteur privé n‘ont
pas donné de résultats probants (Export Processing Zone/Tsarakofafa, African Trade Insurance).
De même, les résultats au niveau de la privatisation des grandes entreprises demeurent partiels, le
sort réservé à des entreprises structurantes (Air Madagascar, ADEMA, JIRAMA) restant encore
incertain. Les résultats en matière de liquidation d‘entreprises publiques sont par contre très
positifs. La performance du Gouvernement a été handicapée par les modifications fréquentes
dans le cadre institutionnel avec la séparation du Ministère en charge de la privatisation et du
développement du secteur privé.
