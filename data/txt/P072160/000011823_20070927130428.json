Environmental\n            concerns focus primarily on the widespread erosion in the\n            country, caused in part by the indiscriminate burning of\n            trees, and crops along riverbanks, thus sedimentation in\n            lakes, and rivers have increased tremendously, threatening\n            the environment with potential desertification. The\n            environmental criteria rates the components for evaluating,\n            and characterizing the audit of a site according to the type\n            of enterprise, emissions and air quality, wastewater\n            (surface and groundwater receptors), wastes and oil spills,\n            noise disturbances, health and safety issues, and, the\n            environmental management regulatory framework.\n            Recommendations include: clinical evaluation of water borne,\n            and related diseases, and assessment of water and\n            sanitation, through laboratory analysis; planning\n            formulation for settlements surrounding reservoirs, to\n            include sanitation facilities, and awareness campaigns on\n            health practices; solid wastes should be collected for\n            disposal at selected dump sites, and, an evaluation of\n            current sewage and water supply systems implemented;\n            decommissioning plans should address dismantling, removal,\n            and safe disposal of obsolete plants, and equipment, in\n            accordance with Bank environmental guidelines."}, "docdt": "2004-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
