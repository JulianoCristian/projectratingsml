Project for Madagascar were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            securing government ownership and commitment are paramount\n            and can never be underestimated. While the project was\n            substantially restructured to better reflect the priorities\n            of the new government's priorities in 2002, it did not\n            go far enough to reengage the new administration to the\n            extent necessary to privatize all companies or empower\n            autonomous 28 regulatory agencies. In least developed\n            countries with weak government capacity, simplicity and\n            prioritization are essential in project design. The\n            development of filters that capture political economy risks\n            in project design, and redesign, will be particularly useful\n            to assess realistic outcomes. Key appointments must be made\n            on a meritocratic basis and not through discretionary\n            appointments. Successful privatization is particularly\n            closely linked to establishing a constituency for reform at\n            the political level."}, "docdt": "2011-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
