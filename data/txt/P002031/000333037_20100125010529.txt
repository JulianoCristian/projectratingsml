                           The Rubber Industry


Nigeria

1.        General. Nigeria is, after Liberia the main natural rubber produc
ing country in Africa. Its production, however, is small in relation to
world production (presently Nigeria's share is about 2%; shares of major
producers are given in Table 1). Therefore, its output at any given time is
not likely to have any major effect on the world market; even if its output
were to double or even treble, the impact on world prices would still be
negligible. Nigeria can thus be classified as a "price taker" in the world
market for natural rubber. Within relatively wide limits its production and
investment decisions will not lead to world distortions.

2.        A review and analysis of Nigeria's rubber industry is given in
Nigeria's agricultural sector survey!/ and will not be repeated here. This
supplement will only give some basic facts of the Nigerian rubber industry.
Estimates of future production and consumption of natural rubber in Nigeria
are in Supplement 14.

3.        Rubber grows throughout southern Nigeria but the main rubber growing
areas of Nigeria are in the Benin and Delta areas of the Mid-Western State.
Rubber grows mainly on smallholdings. There are some large estates, both
private and Government owned, but compared with countries like Malaysia and
Indonesia estates playa less dominant role. Most of the rubber in Nigeria
was planted during the 1940s and during the Korean war. Significant areas
are either completely untapped or partly tapped and there is visible evidence
of poor maintenance and poor tapping standards. Yields are low and most
rubber is now uneconomic. If Nigeria is to sustain its rubber industry,
major replanting is urgently needed.

4.         Area. Nip,eria has an estimated 251,000 hectares under rubber.
About 85;~ is in the Mid-\.Jes tern State. The area under rubber has virtually
remained ullchanged since the mid-50s.

                                                            Page

5.        Production. Rubber production was 77,000 tons in 1966. Annual
production fell to an average of about 56,000 tons during the period of civil
disturbances, and recovered to an average of about 62,000 tons in the 1970-73
period (details are in Table 2).

6.        Exports. Exports from Nigeria amounted to 71,000 tons in 1965 and
1966 and dropped to an average of about 52,000 tons during the years of civil
disturbances. Currently exports average about 50,000 tons (details are in
Table 2). ~rost of Nigeria's rubber export is imported by the United Kingdom
and the United States of America. In 1973 their shares were 55% and 44%
respectively.

7.        In 1969 Nigeria exported 56,700 tons of rubber and this contributed
N19.2 million or 3.1%, to foreign exchange earnings. In 1973 it exported
49,400 tons of rubber, and this contributed N19.4 million or 0.9%, to her
foreign exchange earnings (details are in Table 3). Although a minor contri
butor to total foreign exchange earnings given the dominant position of oil
revenues in foreign exchange earnings, rubber is a major export commodity.
It ranked seven in 1969 (after petroleum, cocoa beans, groundnuts, tin metal,
groundnut oil and palm kernels), and five in 1973 (after petroleum, cocoa
beans, groundnuts and groundnut oil).

8.        Share of World Market. Nigeria produced 3.2% of world natural
rubber in 1965. Its share in world production has since declined gradually
and is presently (1973) 1.9%. Nigeria's share of world exports decreased
from 3.2% in 1965 to 1.6% in 1973 (See table 2).

9.         Domestic Consumption. Local consumption of rubber rose rapidly
during the last few years. Local consumption was estimated at 17,000 tons
in 1973 as compared with 6,000 tons in 1970 and about 5,000 tons in 1965.
This implies a growth rate of 47. annually during the period 1965-1970, but
41;~ annually during 1970-73.  Reportedly there were 42 tire, tube, footwear
and other rubber products manufacturing establishments in 1974 and they
employed about 9,000 people.

Hid-Hestern State

10.       General. About 214,000 ha are under rubber in the Mid-\vestern
State, or 85% of total acreage in Nigeria. Table 4 gives rubber acreage
in the different divisions of the State and table 5 compares rubber acreage
with acreage under other crops. Rubber is an important cash crop in thp
State. It has been estimated (see table 6) that 80% of all households in
the State are engaged in agriculture, and that of those households engaged
in agriculture about 55% grow rubber.

11 .       Smallholdings. Smallholders dominate the rubber sector in the
Mid-Western State owning about 96% of acreage. They produce, however, less
than 90/~ of total output.
                                                           SUPPLEMENT
                                                           Page 3

12.       Official data on farm sizes are based upon the State Sample Survey
of Agricultural Holdings of 1969. Statistics on size should be treated with
caution since they were compiled through intelligent questioning of small
holders who are not always completely familiar with the notion of an acre.
The same applies for statistics on age of trees. Taking this into account
the average rubber smallholding size is estimated at 1.3 ha for the State
as a whole (see table 7). About 25% of holdings is smaller than 1 ha and
15% bigger than 6 ha (see table 8). The proposed limits for small-holdings
to be replanted under the proj ect are 1 and 6 ha. As a rough indication 35%
of all holdings would be between 1 and 2 ha, 20% between 2 and 4 ha, and 5%
between 4 and 6 ha. However, the State average rubber smallholding size does
not reflect the wide variations from division to division (see table 9). In
Benin Division, which would be representative for the Ekiadolor and Abudu
project areas, rubber holdings average about 1 ha, with 30% smaller than
2 ha and 5;~ exceeding 12 ha. In Urhobo Division, which would be representative
for the Orerokpe and Abraka project areas, holdings average about 2.8 ha with
50% smaller than 2 ha and 10% exceeding 12 ha.

13.       There is no serious fragmentation of rubber holdings. Of all hold
ings 55% is in one parcel, 25% in two parcels. 12% in three parcels, 5% in
four parcels and 3% in five or more parcels.

14.        Since no major replanting of smallholdings has been undertaken in
the Hid-Itlestern State, the age profile of smallholder rubber is increasingly
moving towards the end of economid life. About 7% of rubber smallholdings is
30 years old or more. In total 50% of smallholdings is 20 years old or more
(for details see table 10), or in other words within one decade half the small
holder area will have passed its economic useful life.

15.       According to the Ap,ricultural Survey (see para 12),12.8% of rubber
holding was untapped in 1969, 36.8% was completely tapped, 35% was partly
tapped and 15.4% was i~lature. Given the fact that six years passed since
the survey was taken, at best about 50% of rubber smallholdings, would be
tapped at present. 11

16.       All evidence therefore pOints to a deterioration in the rubber
smallholder sector in the Hid-Western State. Hajor replanting with high
yielding varieties is therefore needed. Even replanting 20,000 ha, as pro
posed under the project, would cover only 10% of the area presently under
rubber in the Mid-Western State, and can therefore only be a first phase of
a bigger replanting scheme. Experience gained, research done, and studies
made during the project period will determine the future shape of the re
planting of smallholder rubber in the Mid-Western State.



}/   Under the assumption that untapped and partly tapped areas remain
     unchanged, completely tapped area would now be 36.8 + 15.4.

17.          Estates. Rubber estates in the Mid-Western State have about 9,000
ha planted, which amounts to about 4% of the total area under rubber in the
State. Estates plan to develop a further 2,000 ha in the next few years.
The Mid-West Rubber Development Agency (MRDA), established in 1970, (see also
Supplement 4) owns Urhonigbe and Atochi estates. Planted area of Urhonigbe
is 2,370 ha out of a total area of 2,400 ha. However, a large part (66%) of
the planted area is 20 years old. Planted area at Atochi is about 430 ha out
of a total area of 2,000 ha. Planting at Atochi started in 1968 and }mDA ex
pects to complete planting in 1977. PAMOL (Nigeria) Ltd., a Unilever subsidiary,
owns an estate near Sapele of about 1,660 ha. The estate was established in
1904 and is presently in its third replanting. Replanting is executed in
such a way as to keep estate output more or less constant. Osse River estate
has a planted area of about 1,450 ha out of a total area of 1,700 ha. Utagbo
Uno estate's total area of about 2,000 ha is planted. Both Utagbo Uno and
Osse River are managed by Nigerian Joint Agencies Limited (NIJAL). Both estates
are 49% State and 51% foreign owned. NIJAL was originally formed as a manag
ing agency by various British and Malaysian interest who were developing
rubber estates in Nigeria, and in addition to the rubber estates in the Mid
\.,Tcstern State, NIJAL manages rubber estates in Western and South Eastern
State. It also manages completely State owned oil palm estates in Western
State. 1/ Other estates, not listed above, have an estimated planted area
of about 1,000 ha.

18.       Estate production is estimated at about 6,100 tons or about 10% of
the State's rubber output. Estate production will increase as more planted
areas mature. With average yields between 1 to 1.5 ton/ha estate production
could reach a level of between 11,000 and 16,000 tons annually. Latex from
estates is largely produced into sheet rubber of high quality (RSS1) at the
estate factories. PAMOL also produces liquid latex, and NIJAL plans to
develop crumb rubber processing on its estates.

19.       Processing Capacity. Estates have their own processing facilities.
Lewis and Peat, the largest broking company in the United Kingdom, has a
processing facility near Sapele able to produce about 12,000 tons of crumb
rubber annually. Goodyear has built a crumb processing factory in Benin
with an initial capacity of 12,000 tons/annually, and its capacity can easily
be expanded to 24,000 tons/annually. In addition to processing facilities
of estates, there are presently some 12 crepe processing factories in the
Mid-Western State with a total capacity of 60,000 tons annually. Present
capacity for sheet processing is estimated at 25,000 tons. Thus with the
two largest crumb factories taken into account total present processing
capacity In the State for smallholder latex/coagulum is well over 100,000
ton/year.

20.       Existing and planned crumb rubber processing capacity is estimated
at about 50,000 tons annually. Clearly this capacity is sufficiently large
to cater for project output which is estimated at 24,600 tons at full maturity
in 1991.

21.       Tentative figures available from an industrial survey conducted in
1972 show that about 2,000 people were employed in rubber processing factories.
Capital invested in these factories was estimated at about N7.4 million and
value added at about N35.6 million.

1.

Agricultural development in Nigeria is the responsibility of thirteen 

separate governments - the Federal Government and twelve State governments. 

The Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (FMANR) is responsi 

ble for overall coordination of agricultural development. It funds the State 

ministries of agriculture allocating 50% of available funds on the basis of 

population and 50% on the basis of equality. Besides these allocations, 

FHAl\lR provides special grants for approved development schemes. 


2.        The Federal Department of Agriculture (FDA) is one of the depart
ments under FMAL\lR, and it works through three divisions: (i) land and water
resources division; (ii) planning division; and (iii) crop production divi
sion. The Monitoring and Evaluation Unit (MEU) would report to the Director
of FDA through the planning division.

3.        FMG is giving high priority to agricultural development and under
the Third National Development Plan (April 1975-March 1980), $4 billion is
to be spent on agricultural development. 1/

4.         Honitoring and Evaluation Unit - As part of the three Nigerian
oil palm projects 3/ a l'!onitoring Evaulation Unit (MEU) has been established
under the planning-division of the Federal Department of Agriculture. The
r1EU would be primarily concerned wi th (a) the financial and technical
monitoring of ongoing projects; (b) evaluating their financial, economic
and socio-economic impact; and (c) providing assistance in the planning and
preparation of future development programs.

     Development.

5.        The main tree crop projects involve cocoa, oil palm and rubber,
and Benin in the Mid-Western State is a suitable base for staff concerned
with monitoring these projects. FDA would establish MEU and within one
year of the date of effectiveness 1/ of the oil palm projects 2/ a team of
specialists would be recruited to form the Tree Crop Section ofMEU (TCS/
MEU). Senior specialist staff of TCS/MEU would have qualification acceptable
to FMG and the Bank 1/ and would be recruited internationally but no post
would be filled without a careful review of local candidates.

6.        The specialist staff of TCS/MEU would work in close conjunction with
the appropriate Federal research institutions and university faculties. Con
sultants acceptable to FMG and the Bank 1/ would periodically be used to cover
specific fields of activity such as research, business management, processing
engineering and project preparation. TCS/MEU would prepare progress reports
for submission to Federal and State Governments, and, where appropriate,
external financing agencies.

7.        The financial control system being used in projects would be examined
by TCS/MEU at least every six months with particular attention to the timing
and procedures used in procurement, disbursement control, grant/credit account
ing, produce price formulation, and the control of credit repayments. Techni
cal evaluation would concentrate on assessing the standards being attained in
nurseries, field planting, maintenance, harvesting/tapping, produce collection
and processing. To facilitate objective monitoring it will be necessary to
establish an agreed system for quantitative assessment of work done in relation
to the main field practices. Inspection and field supervisory staff must apply
the same criteria if the analysis of inspection data and the recommendations
arising therefrom are to serve as effective instruments of management.

8.        Continuous evaluation of the economic and socio-economic impact of
the projects would be carried out in conjunction with institutions such as
the Nigerian Institute for Social and Economic Research. In addition to
measuring the financial/economic benefits accruing to the participating farmers
and companies, assessments would be made of changes in employment levels,
business activity, consumption patterns, participation in education and other
economic and socio-economic indicators of community well-being.

9.        TCS/MEU would assist in the planning and preparation of future
development programs by providing project management units with the basic
support services required such as (a) providing detailed guidelines for
project preparation; (b) ensuring that services required from other institu
tions are made available for the project preparation; and (c) attending Steer
ing Committee meetings.

10.       More details on MEU can be found in Report 474a-UNI, Supplementary
Annexes to the Nigerian Oil Palm Project Appraisal Reports.

11.       Rubber Research Institute of Nigeria (RRIN) was established in 1961,
and came under the control of B1G in 1972. RRIN will playa role in the
training component of the project. For details see Supplement 9.


                         B.   State Institutions


12.       Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR). The ministry
is responsible for planning and executing agricultural programs within the
State. In the past, in the absence of effective planning and coordination at
the Federal level, each State planned its own development, seldom looking
beyond its borders. Little or no consideration was then given to comparative
economic advantage as seen from a country-wide basis and hence no regional
specialisation could develop. But ecological zones, water catchment areas,
drainage basins and natural forest stands were part of the natural environ
ment before State boundaries were formed. State plans therefore did not
necessarily reflect the best allocation of resources for the nation as a
whole. There was and still is unnecessary duplication of efforts and the
effectiveness of scarce resources (mainly trained manpower since at present
funds from mineral oil are available in ample supply) is therefore reduced.
However, FMG and the States recognize this problem and are taking steps to
improve machinery for planning and coordinating agricultural development on
a country-wide basis. The Tree Crop Section of the Monitoring and Evaluation
Unit is especially designed to further this as far as tree crops are concerned.

13.       There are adequate numbers of experienced staff in the Ministry of
Agriculture and Natural Resources, but as a whole the ministry does not appear
very strong. Especially with the Cocoa II project (Loan 1045-UNI) just signed,
the Mid-Western State Nucleus Estate/Smallholder Oil Palm Project just
negotiated, and this project, the ministry needs to look very carefully at its
future manpower requirements if it is not to promote development in certain
agricultural fields at the expense of development in other agricultural fields.
Total numbers of staff required for these three projects, is given in Supple
ment 4, Appendix 2.

14.       A separate Rubber Division in ~~R was established in 1969 under the
Chief Tree Crops Officer. However, this division was abolished when MANR was
reorganized in April 1974. The present organization 1/ of MANR is given in
chart 9427 attached to this Supplement. The Tree Crop Unit (TCU) will now
be responsible for managing all tree crop projects.

15.       The Rubber Advisory Board (RAB) was established by the State Govern
ment in 1967 to advise the State in all matters related to the improvement of
the national rubber sector. Its membership consists of representatives of
~7    TCU is not presented in this chart. However. the General Manager of TCO
      will be directly responsible to the Permanent Secretary through the Controller
      of Agricultural Services.
                                                                SUPPLEMENT 2
                                                                Page 4

the Mid-Western Farmers Union, the Mid-West Rubber Farmers Association, the
Rubber Traders Association, the Rubber Estate OWners Association, the process
ing industry, and the Ministries of Trade and Industries, and Economic Develop
ment. The Director of RRIN and the Chief Agricultural Officer l! are also
members.

16.         The specific functions of the Rubber Advisory Board are as follows:

       (i)  studying the structure of the rubber industry and export
            trade with a view to recommending measures that will benefit
            producers and improve the quality of production;

      (ii)  examining from time to time the existing system of inspection
            and recommending suitable legislation;

      (iii)  recommending visits overseas to study the latest methods of 

             production and marketing; 


      (iv)  liaison between consumers and producers; and

       (v)  organization of rubber associations in the State.

17.       RAB has made certain recommendations, some of which have been
implemented. Among these are the setting up of the Mid-West Rubber Develop
ment Agency (MRDA) and initiating a replanting program through MANR's Rubber
Division. The replanting program was not very successful and TCU will now
be responsible for all replanting of rubber.

18.       RAB will not be directly involved in project execution. However,
since all those connected with the rubber industry are represented on the
Board, it can provide a useful forum for exchange of ideas and experience.
But in order to be more useful, RAil should have a more institutionalized
existence, and streamline its procedures. Also its membership should be
expanded and include TCU's General Manager, the Head of the Rubber Division
of TCU and the Registrar of Cooperatives.

19.       Mid-West Rubber Development Agency (MRDAL was established in 1970
by Edict No. 22. Under the project it will be responsible for collecting the
latex/coagulum from the smallholders' Group Collection Centers. Details are
in Supplement 4.

20.       The Cooperative Movement would play an important role in the proj ect.
Although smallholders would not be required to be members of a cooperative as
a condition of their participation in the project, the Group Collection
Center would be operated on a cooperative basis. Smallholders would become
members of a cooperative within one year after signing of their agreement
with TCU and forming or reforming cooperatives would be organized simultaneously
with the calling and appro.ing of applications.   The cooperatives would run
the GCC's and be responsible for credit repayment. For their guaranteeing
repayment by smallholders, the cooperatives will receive an interest spread
(see Supplement 6).

21.       The fUd-Western State Cooperative Movement was part of the Western
Region Cooperative Hovement before the foundation of the Mid-Western State.
It suffered from the separation and especially from the civil disturbances.
However, the cooperative movement is progressively recovering and, although
still rather young, appears to be capable of continuing to expand.

22.       The cooperative movement consists of primary societies (more than
900 with around 35,000 members), secondary unions (more than 20) and two apex
organizations - the Mid-Western Nigeria Co-Operative Federation Ltd. (MWNCF)
for marketing and the Mid-Western Nigeria Cooperative Central Financing Society
Ltd. for credit. For more details and statistics see Report 497a-UNI,
Appraisal of Nucleus Estate/Smallholder Oil Palm Project, Nigeria, Mid-Western
State, Annex 1.

23.       The Cooperative Societies Division of the Ministry of Trade and
Industry regulates the Cooperative Movement. It is headed by the Registrar
of Cooperatives and it has headquarters in Benin. There are four assistant
registrars who are in charge of: marketing, credit, training, and development
and planning. There are five circle offices, which provide services to and
control over the unions and societies. 1/

24.       Legal steps required to form a cooperative are minimal. After an
application has been approved, the cooperative society becomes an unregistered
society; it can be fully registered after supervision has proved that the
society is financially and structurally sound. Of the 945 cooperatives
(para. 22), 608 are formally registered and 337 are unregistered.

25.       The primary societies, functioning through Produce Marketing Unions,
are engaged in the marketing of cocoa, palm kernels, cotton and rubber. Three
Cooperative Produce Marketing Unions (CPMU) are engaged in Rubber t1arketing.
They are the Benin CPMU in Benin, Urhobo CPMU in Sapele and Delta CPMU in
warri. Each Union is formed by three or more registered cooperative societies.

The Apex organization is MWNCF. MWNCF can guarantee loans advanced against
expected production, but experience with this form of credit has been unsatis
factory and few guarantees are given. MWNCF is also engaged in educational
and publicity activities.

Technical development now makes it more profitable for the rubber industry
to process latex into crumb rubber in large central processing factories.
The rubber cooperatives will therefore need to adapt to these changed cir
cumstances. Under the project the Group Collection Centers will provide
the cooperatives with an opportunity to develop initial assembly systems
that are geared to modern central processing factories.

                            Project Areas


Location

1.         The four project areas, covering a total of about 5,700 sq km are
wi thin the predominantly rubber growing areas of the Mid-\vestern State, and
they are located north and south of the two oil palm project areas. 11

          Ekiadolor area. A rectangular area around Benin Ci ty · I t is
bordered to the westby Okomu forest reserve, and to the south by the Gilli -
Gilli and the Usonigbe forest reserves. Total area is estimated at about
190,OOOha.

          Abudu area. A rectangular area mainly north and west of Agbor.
It is adjacent to the Ekiadolor area. The area includes the Ehor forest
reserve and part of the Ebue forest reserve. Total area is estimated at
about 210,000 ha.

          Orerokpe area. A polygonal shaped area just south of Sapele and
north of \varrL Its border in the north is more or less formed by the Benin
River. Total area is estimated at about 90,000 ha.

          Abraka area. A polygonal shaped area around Abbi.     Total area
is estimated at about 80,000 ha.

           The project areas are marked on map 11329R, attached to this report.

Climate

2.        Rainfall. The four project regions are situated in a zone with a
mean annual rainfall of between 1,770 nm and 2,540 rom (70" and 100"), that
increases from the north to the south (see map 11426 attached to this
Supplement). There is a pronounced dry season during the months December,
January and February and a wet season covering the months June, July, 'August
and September. There is, however, a considerable variation in monthly rain
from year to year (see table 1). The dry season is more promin~nt in the

                                                               SUPPLUlliNT 3
                                                               Page 2

north than in the south. Much rainfall just before and after the dry season
comes in thunderstorms which are often accompanied hy winds of up to force 8
on the Heaufort scale.

3.        Sunshine and Temperatures. What sunshine records are available
indicate that the mean annual sunshine lies between 1,700 and 1,800 hours.
Mean temperatures in the project areas are between 26 0 e and 27 0 e with mean
maxima over 30 0 e and mean minima over 21°C.

4.        Windstorms. As mentioned above, winds of up to force 8 on the
Beaufort scale can accompany the thunderstorms which occur before and after
the dry season. Particularly after the dry season storms are liable to
damage rubber trees because at that time they carry a heavy flush of leaves
after Wintering.

5.        Wintering and Seedfall. Wintering of rubber trees in the project
areas occurs in January and February as a result of the onset of the dry
season in December. Subsequent flowering normally results in seedfall in
mid-August. The dehiscence of the rubber fruits depends on a period of
relatively low humidity so that the actual seedfall depends on the timing
of a dry spell in August and September. The seedfall may therefore be as
early as the beginning of August and as late as mid-September. Each year's
nursery operations must therefore be timed according to the particular condi
tions prevailing.

6.        Vegetation. The areas to be replanted are at present under rubber
trees which are largely unselected seedlings planted at high density with no
systematic spacing. Grasses and perennial weeds are present and require con
trol, however, the main weed, Eupatorium odoratum (Siam Weed) must completely
eradicated and kept out of the replantings in order to minimize the high
risk of reinfestation. Eupatorium flourishes in the Mid-Western State, but
tends to be less serious in the dense rubber plantings where the trees
compete for light.

~01ls/Topography

7.         General. The greater part of the project areas lies on Acid sand
soils derived fron unconsolidated coarse sandstones underbedded with layers
of clay. The soils are deep sandy latosols which have been classified into
the red Benin fasc and the yellow Calabor fasc soils. Typically, the domi
nant color becomes clearer and brighter down the profile and the clay content
increases.

8.        The land in the proj ect areas is flat to gently undulating and is
dissected by slowly flowing streams which have a greatly reduced flot" in the
dry season. Steep slopes are sometimes encountered near the streams. The
soils on such slopes tend to be heavily depleted of nutrient, but such areas
are not Significant.

9.        Ekiadolor area. Mainly sandy clayey soils, the texture being a
sandy and clayey loam on sandy clay at 61 to 76 cm. (24 to 30 inches) except
for the sandy wash soils of the lower slopes. To the west and o south0 of the
Benin area the land is flat to gently rolling with slopes of 1 to 3 and the
soils are brown, reddish brown and clayey sands. Towards the east there are
                              0
some valley slopes of up to 20 · Apart from areas where the slopes exceed
   o
15 the soils in the region are generally suitable for planting rubber.

10.       AQudu area. The soils are similar to those in the Ekiadolor area
but areas with valley slopes are more common, particularly to the east.

11.       Abraka area. To the north west and north east the soils are pre
dominantly sandy, the texture being a sandy loam on sand at 61 to 76 cm (24
                                     · 0 0
to 30 inches). The land is flat or gently undulating with slopes of 1 to 3 ·
The color is brown to reddish brown to red. To the south and east of Abraka
the land is flat to gently undulating but with yellowish brown clayey sands
with seasonal swamps and moving water along the broad drainage channels. The
higher ground is suitable for rubber but the seasonally flooded areas are not.

12.       Orerokpe area. The area consists of flat to gently undulating
land consisting of yellowish brown clayey sands. Towards the south of the
area seasonal swamps and moving water become more common and planting of rubber
becomes impossible.

Water table

13.       The areas with high water tables and seasonal flooding south of the
Abraka and Orerokpe regions (see also map 11329R where marginal rubber areas
are indicated) are not recommended for replanting under the project. The
growth of the present rubber in these areas is poor. The trees have yellowish
green foliage and, in some cases, display distinct dieback of the crown. The
bark of the tapping panels near the base of the trunks is frequently badly
damaged as a result of a combination of panel diseases and rotting induced by
submersion in flood water. Many trees were observed to have fallen naturally;
others examined had been pushed over by bulldozers in the course of road con
struction. Their tap roots were stunted, consistent with growth in a high
water table, with the result that the trees had been unable to obtain nutrients
from any depth and were liable to be blown over because of lack of anchorage.
The specific boundaries between land suitable for rubber and land unsuitable
because of high water tables and seasonal flooding are impossible to define
accurately. While some areas in the south of the Abraka and Orerokpe areas
are suitable for rubber, others must be considered marginal or unsuitable.
Alternative land use for these areas should accordingly be the subject of
investigation.

Population

14.       A census was held in Nigeria towards the end of 1973. Tentatively,
Nigeria's population is now estimated at 80 million, growing at about 2.6%
annually. The preliminary results of tpe census indicate, however, substantial
demographic changes, and census resuits are subject to a review by a commission
of experts. No official figures have yet been published. The only official'
figures available relate to the 1963 census and only a rough indication about
the population in the project areas can be obtained by projections from these
figures.

15.       The population of the Mid-Western State was recorded at 1.5 million
in 1952 and 2.5 million in 1963, and is estimated (applying a growth rate of
2.6%), at about 3.3 million in 1974. Population densities in selected divi
sions of the Mid-Western State are estimated as follows:

Land Tenure

  19.       The system of land tenure is not uniform and ownership is vested in
  the various communities with any grants or transactions being under the control
  of the head of the community in consultation with the elders. Land is allo
  csted by the community to its constituent families or sometimes to individuals
  on a more or less permanent basis, according to their needs and capabilities.
  Fragmentation of holdings does not yet appear to be a problem. According to
  a Government survey 55% of rubber holdings and 79% of cocoa holdings were in
  one parcel. 1/ Granting of land by a community to one of its native families
  confers virtually permanent right of occupation so long as it is used. Un
  cultivated land theoretically reverts back to the community, but the fallow
  period is generally recognized. Having a tree crop on the land means that the
. land is considered to be under cultivation even though the tree crop may not
  be harvested. If the tree crop is felled, land should revert back to the
  community. but in practice replanting one's land is almost always permitted.
  Only in a few extreme cases - where a farmer has wanted to replant a sizeable
  acreage and where there were shortages of land for food crop - has replanting
  of the whole of the original area not been allowed. However, within the
  planting range of 1-6ha proposed under the project no such problem are ex
  pected. Furthermore, timely consultation betweenTCU field staff and the
  head and elders of a community would generally solve any of these issues.

20.       Virtually permanent right of occupation exists so long as land is
used but normally with restrictions on rights of disposal, particularly to
non-natives; land is traditionally granted to outsiders only for the growing
of annual crops but in practice this rule is not invariably enforced ·. With
increasing pressure from population there is. a growing market in land, which
despite traditional constraints, is frequently purchased, pledged and leased
and a growing tendency towards individual ownership is apparent. Nevertheless,

      . Notebook, Volume II, 1972.
                                                              SUPPLEMENT 3
                                                              Page 7

even within the traditional system,   the rights of a planter of a permanent
crop to maintain and harvest it are   well recognized. In the more densely
settled areas near the towns, where   land may have been occupied by a family
for several generations, the family   is increasingly accepted as possessing
virtually "freehold" title.

21.       Although title is generally unrecorded, family and individual rights
arc usually well known and accepted within the community. Demarcation of
boundaries before an application fo'r replanting is approved, should help in
making sure that no disagreement about land ownership exists. In general,
therefore, the land tenure system does not impede replanting of rubber and
provides adequate security of tenure for the planting of tree crops.

22.       Tenancy on land belonging to absentee owners of an individual or
family inheritance is fairly common, with the tenant paying either an agreed
rant in cash or kind, or a share in the crop. Although some of these absentee
landowners would certainly be interested in replanting rubber under the project,
it is proposed for reasons both of equity and ease of supervision to restrict
participation in the project to genuine operating smallholders.

Farming systems in the project area

23.        Farming is generally carried out on a shifting cultivation basis
wi th a typical bush-fallow cycle of about 7 years · Cultivation of foodcrops
normally takes place over two to three seasons - mainly maize, yam and cassava,
but also plantain and cocoyam - and is followed by a fallow period of four to
five seasons. However, only a small portion of the total cropped land is under
annual crops. Reportedly about 20% of area under crops is under annual crops
and the remainder under tree crops, most of which is rubber.

24.       Official data on farm sizes are based upon the State Sample Survey
of Agricultural Holdings 1969. It reveals an average holding under annual
crops of about 0.5 ha 11 and an average 1.3 ha under rubber. However, the
situation in the project areas is not everywhere the same. In the two northern
rubber project areas ~I the average size of rubber holdings is about 1 ha, while
in the two southern project areas the average size of rubber holdings is about
2.8 ha (see also Supplement 1, para 12).

25.       Farm budgets for different crops or combination of crops have been
prepared during the appraisal of the oil palm projects and this analysis will
not be repeated here. Details can be found in Report No. 474a-UNI, Supple
mentary Annexes to the Nigerian Oil Palm Project Appraisal Reports (Supplement
2). Information on farm incomes is sketchy. However, based on the above
mentioned studies and some other preliminary studies, it is estimated that
typical arable smallholdings of 1 ha may earn a gross return of between N150

II  Given the bush-fallow cycle, a farmer would have 2 ha or more available.
21    Ekiadolor and Abudu project areas are the northern areas, and Orerokpe
      and Abraka project areas are the southern areas.
                                                                 SUPPLEMENT 3
                                                                 Page 8

and N300 from arable crops, of which some *100 to N200 might      be the value of
food produced for household consumption. This income may be       augmented by
income from cash crops. Yields from present rubber holdings       are poor at
about 750 lb/ha (300 lb/acre). At the present price paid to       smallholders of
not JOOre than 4 kobo/lb of lump, 1/ 1 ha of rubber will give     a gross return
of about N60, which is hardly an incentive, since this gives      a gross return
per manday of less than NO. 50 ·

Communications

26.       The Mid-\-lestern State has a well developed communication system,
consisting of about 9,000 km of roads, over 1,600 km of navigable rivers,
and domestic air services provided by Nigerian Airways. The State has no
railways. The rivers, including the Bening river, play an important role
in transport especially in the coastal areas where road construction is
inhibited by river deltas and swamps.

27.       The road network consists of about 550 km of Federal Trunk A two
land bitumen roads, 2,400 km of State Trunk B bitumen roads and about 6,000
km of earth roads.

28.        The road network in the Mid-Western State is dense. Calculation!/
of the road density revealed that the Mid-Western State average road density
of 0.114 km/sq km is higher than that of Nigeria as a whole which is with
0.095 km/sq km in the fifth place among the West African countries. The
divisions of Warri, Western Ijaw, as well as 50% of Aboh division, have no
roads at. all because of swampy ground conditions; the road density for the
remaining area of the State would be around 1.152 kmlsq km thus exceeding
the 1.136 km/sq km found in Togo, which has the highest road density of West
African countries.

29.       .The proposed four project areas cover about 570,000 ha. Three miles
have been defined as the limit of which seedlings, fertilizer, and latex would
be carried by smallholders on bicycles from roads to their plantings and vice
versa. This is in line with observations in the field concerning the trans
portation of latex. Based on this limit the inaccessible areas in the project
areas have been measured and are marked up on map 11329R. Inaccessible areas
range from 5% of the total Agbor project area to 0% in the Abraka project area
where single lane bituminized roads, many used for oil exploration, proliferate.
Average inaccessible percent of the total four project areas is 4% (details
are in table 2). Not all the inaccessible areas are within predominantly rubber
growing regions; for the four project areas only 2% of predominantly rubber
growing areas is inaccessible. Even this figure is likely to be conservative
as  it is more than likely that adequate access for agricultural purposes
exists; physical inspection of every road and track in each project area was
not possible ·

30.       The two major inputs requiring truck transport during field estab
lishment are planting material and fertilizers. The existing road network 
even in its present partly deteriorated situation - is considered adequate.
Even more so since the proposed rubber replanting project of 20,000 ha equals
only about 10% of the present area WIder rubber in the Mid-vJestern State.

31.       In 1982 when the rubber replantings are brought into tapping, latex
will be collected and brought to Croup Collection Centers (Gee's) from where
latex/coagulum will be transported daily to the central processing factories.
Gee's will usually be located in existing villages and towns; most, if not
all. are presently accessible to lorry traffic. The current State Road
Construction Program (details in appendix 1) is estimated to cost N69 million
(US$112 million) and all existing contracts should be completed by 1980/1981.
Current Federal road contracts (see also map 11329R) should alao be completed
by 1981/1982. Additionally it is confidently expected that during the period
between now and 1982 other road projects either from the Federal and the State
road development plans and/or from the priority list of projects of the UNDP
financed transport survey. will at least be let to contract if not completed;
thereby further enhancing the road coverage. and hence accessibility in the
rubber project areas.

32.       In view of the adequacy of existing road network conditions and
future road development programs, no road component is considered necessary
as part of the rubber project.

                          MID-WESTERN STATE


                      Organization and Management


1.        Project implementation would directly involve four organizations,
namely:

          The Tree Crop Unit (TCU) - which would be responsible for
          implementing the replanting program for smallholders;

          The Mid-West Rubber Development Agency (MRDA) - which would
          be responsible for the daily collection of latex/coagulum
          from the Group Collection Centers (GCC's) for transportation
          to the processing companies;

          The Rubber Research Institute of Nigeria (RRIN) - which would
          build training facilities; and

          The Monitoring and Evaluation Unit (MEU), which would evaluate
          the trials with GCC's and determine the future organization
          of initial processing and collection, and which would also
          prepare a second phase proj ect.


                        A.Tree Crop Unit (TCU)


General Objectives

2.        A Tree Crop Unit (TCU) established under the second Cocoa Project 1/
Hould be responsible for implementing programs involving the new planting/ 
replanting of cocoa, oil palm, and rubber. The TCU would have a high degree
of financial and administrative autonomy and would report to the Ministry of
Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR). A Project Coordinating Committee
comprised of representatives of relevant Government agencies would be
responsible for determining TeU policy and approving development/operations
programs and budgets. Under the Oil Palm Project.2/ TCU would engage a
consulting firm acceptable to Government and the Bank to set up a system

l/   Loan 1045 UNI, and appraisal report 282a-UNI, dated May 21, 1974.
~/   Appraisal report 497a-UNI, dated March 28, 1975.
                                                                SUPPLENENT 4
                                                                Page 2

of mechanized accounts that meets the needs of the smallholder oil palm
project. The SRme firm would be asked to advise on the type and venues
for training the staff required to operate the system. Under the smallholder
rubber project, TCU would also engage consultants in order to adapt its
mechanized accounting system to the specific needs of the rubber project.

3.        TCU headquarters would be in Benin with branches - Regional Units 
located at selected focal points of ~he new planting/replanting program. TCU
would be staffed primarily wtth personnel either seconded from MANR or
recruited elsewhere in Nigeria. It must, however, be emphasized that the
technical and financial direction of the tree crop projects will require well
qualified and experienced staff. TCU would be responsible for appraising
new planting/replanting applications and providing the technical and financial
services involved in the field establishment and post maturity stages. The
planting techniques and standards to be followed by TCU would be those agreed
with the proposed Tree Crop Section of the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit
(TCS/MEU) and the relevant Federal Research Institutions.

The Project Coordinating Committee - Its Composition and Functions

4.            The Project Coordinating Committee would be comprised of the
following:

        (i)   Chairman - Pennanent Secretary of Hinistry of Agriculture and
              Natural Resources;

       (ii)   Pennanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance or his
              representative;

      (iii)   A senior representative of the Cooperatives Division of the
              Ministry of Trade and Industries;

       (iv)   A senior representative of the }anistry of Economic Develop
              ment and Reconstruction;
        (v)   A senior representative of the Mid-West Rubber Development
              Agency;

       (vi)   A representative of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture;

      (vii)   The General Manager of TCU;

     (viii)   The Controller of Agricultural Services; and

       (ix)   The Head of TCU's Rubber Division - who would be secretary
              for rubber meetings.

          The chainnan would be authorized to co-opt up to three additional
non-voting members to the committee. A quorum would require 6 voting members
and in the event of a tie, the Chairman would have a casting vote.
                                                                  SUPPLEMENT 4
                                                                  Page 3

\,",ould be to:

     (i)  determine policy;

    (il)  appoint the General Manager, Controller of Field Operations
           and the Controller of Finance, for which Bank agreement would
           be required;

   (iii)  review the organizational structure of TCU (see Charts 9322R
          and 9323R attached to this Supplement), including terms of
          staff employment;

     (v)  review quarterly progress reports and approve any program
          amendments; and

    (vi)  approve the annual report and accounts.

Management Structure and Staffing

6.        ~~nagement Structure.  TCU would have its Headquarter in Benin.
The Rubber Division would have four Regional Units respectively in Ekiadolor,
Abudu, Abraka and Orerokpe~ The basic management structure is outlined in
the Charts 9322R and 9323R attached to this Supplement, the main division of
functions being:

     (i)  Headquarters staff would be responsible for directing and super
          vising the technical and financial services being operated by
          the Regional Units, liaising closely with the Tree Crop Section
          of the Honitoring and Evaluation Unit in evaluating on-going
          and planning future programs, and Headquarter staff would
          also be responsible for establishing training programs for staff
          and farmers.

    (ii)  Headquarter staff would be responsible for financial control,
          including budget preparation, control of smallholder grant/credit
          accounts, and for internal audit and general administration.

   (iii)  Regional Unit staff would be responsible for the appraisal of
          applications, supervision of grant/credit services, timely dis
          tribution of farm inputs, and for providing extension and other
          services to the farmers.

7.        Staffing. The project's technical and financial direction would
require suitably qualified and experienced staff, recruited internationally
if necessary. Middle level technical and administrative positions would
be filled by professional or senior technical grade officers recruited from
                                                            SUPPLEMENT 4
                                                            Page 4

wi thin the State or from other States in Nigeria. Lower level field and
admInistrative staff would be recruited from existing Government agencies or
tIle private sector.  Details of the numbers and phasing of professional and
technical staff requirements are given in Table 1.

8.        The General Manager - the chief executive of TCU would be delegated
full responsibility for implementing the new planting/replanting programs
under the Cocoa, Oil Palm and Rubber Projects. He would be directly respon
sible through the Controller of Agricultural Services to the Permanent Secre
tary of the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources. The person
appointed should have a professional qualification in agriculture and at
least 10 years' experience, 5 of which should have been in a senior adminis
trative position. A job description is in Appendix I.

9.        The Controller of Field Operations - would be responsible for
organizing and directing the technical aspects of the program, including
nursery work, appraisal of applications, supervision of planting and mainte
nance in the innnature and mature stages. He would also be responsible for
organizing in-service training for all levels of field staff. The person
appointed should have had at least 8 years' experience of tree crop planting
(oil palm, cocoa or rubber), preferably at a senior management level with a
commercial organization. A job description is in Appendix 1.

10.       The Controller of Finance - would be responsible for the general
administration of TCU and all project financial controls and procedures.
He would also be responsible for calculation of loan repayments due, calcula
tion of margins to be retained by cooperatives for their guaranteeing loan
repayments of members, and for making arrangements for the actual handling
of repayments. This man would need to be a well-qualified accountant with
at least 8 years' experience at senior management level preferably in the
agro-industry.   A job description is in Appendix 1.

11.       Head of Rubber Division - would be responsible for implementing
the technical appraisal and supervision of all field operations. He would
need to be very experienced in modern rubber planting techniques with at
least five years at a senior field management l·evel. A job description is
in Appendix 1.

12.       Regional Unit Managers of the Rubber Division - would be in charge
of the field operations at regional level and should be Senior Agricultural
Officers (SAO) \vith about 3 years' experience at that level. Preference
would be given to SAO's who had experience of modern rubber planting tech
niques, but in any event, these officers \vould be given in-service training
courses at RRIN. A job description is in Appendix 1.

13.        Other professional, technical and administrative staff of the
Regional Units would mainly be recruited from Government services or directly
from tertiary/secondary level educational institutions. In order to equip
                                                            SUPPLEMENT 4
                                                            Page 5

such staff with the specialized techniques required for implementing this
project, appropriate in-service training would be given at selected institu
tions.

Operational Procedures

14.       The project would aim at confining participation under the grant/
credit scheme to genuine operating farmers, with the minimum size qualifying
for inclusion 1 ha and the maximum confined to 6 ha. The minimum of 1 na
is considered to be the smallest area that it is administratively practical
to accept under the project. The maximum of 6 ha would require three tappers
which certainly involves a large family unit. Where land is owned communally,
a maximum of 6 ha would be applied to each identifiable farm family unit
within the community. Participating smallholders would be required to become
members of registered cooperative societies which would be established as
soon as possible after approval of applications. These cooperatives would
ultimately operate the Group Collection Centers.

15.       Notices calling for applications from smallholders and giving
details where forms can be obtained would be published through such media
as local newspapers, radio and public administration offices, such as commu
nity centers. In order to facilitate the concentration of field staff, parti
CUlarly in the year of planting when the heaviest intensity of farm visits is
required, a zonal approach to development would be used. In any given year,
applications for replanting/planting would be restricted to specific zones
within the project area. Allowance for any shortfall in applications from a
given primary zone could be catered for by having an adjacent reserve zone
from which applications could be requested but only be accepeted in the event
of there being a shortfall in the primary zone. To allow adequate time for
applications to be filled and submitted by smallholders and appraised by TCU
technical staff, applications would be called for at the beginning of the
year preceding planting and the closing date would be the end of March of the
same year. Agricultural Assistants (AA) will be the field staff in direct
and continuous contact with the farmers and the aim should be to allocate
these men to farms that are relatively close to one another, thereby reducing
travelling time during farm visits and also facilitating the organization of
demonstrations and group discussion activities. Field staff requirements
have been derived using the following assumptions for the number of visits:
               Required Visits_in each Year (per holding)
                   Year                 Number of visits

and rubber projects.

16.       When an application has been approved under a given annual replant
ing program, the field operations pertaining to the first year of planting
must be completed within the year to which the approval refers. At the end
of each year, the approvals shoufd be deemed to have lapsed in respect of
the whole or part of any areas so approved, which have not been replanted.
The applicant would, however, be at liberty to submit a new application for
any ensuing annual program for the specific area or zone in respect of such
unplanted area.

17.        Grant/credit would be made in respect of approved applications for
replanting in accordance with any general or specific instructions which the
TCU may from time to time prescribe. Grant/credit in cash or kind would only
be made in respect of areas replanted according to the standards specified
by the TCU. In all ins tances payments in cash or kind would only be made
subject to a field inspection report verifying that acceptable hysbandry
standards had been attained. Loan repayments would be made according to the
conditions specified in a loan agreement (see Supplement 6).

18.       Tree felling and cutting will be undertaken by contractors. Teu
would prepare the tender documents and organize the timetables which contrac
tors have to follow in the executing of their work. If not enough contractors
are available, TCU would organize and train its own gangs and execute the
felling on force account or organize the smallholders to do this. The costs
of felling and cutting would be charged to the smallholders credit account.

19.       Presently old rubber trees are used or sold as firewood. However,
in view of the large amount of timber (see also Supplement 5, Appendix 10)
that will be felled, alternative usage of timbers, such as for charcoal,
particle board, hardwood and pulp, is clearly possible. As soon as
possible, a study for alternative usage of timber would be .... in order
to determine its most profitable use. For the time being TCU will advise
the smallholder about the disposal of felled timber, but when the re
commendations for alternative usage of timber are made, it is envisaged
that TCU could make the necessary arrangements for the sale of timbers from
the sma11ho1dings and that collection of timber from sma11ho1dings would be
in accordance with timetables that relate to the planting program and
recommended field practices; Part of the sales value of timber could then
be paid to the smallholder at the time of collection, and the remainder
could be transmitted to TCU as credit repayments against the costs of
felling and cutting (see Supplement 6).

20.       Arrangements for felling and cutting and for the sale of timber would
be regularly reviewed by TCU in order to reach maximum efficiency in these
operations. Clearly one single contract for felling and cutting the trees
and the subsequent sale of the timber under which contract the contractor
would pay a fee to the smallholder to allow for the whole operation, has
                                                             SUPPLEMENT 4
                                                             Pa~e 7


of land, including felling, and although the timber industry and trade has
shown interest in the large quantity of rubber timber which would become
available, there is not yet sufficient evidence that the two operations (fell
ing and cutting, and sale) could, at this point in time, easily be combined.

21.       Representatives of the Cooperative Division of the Ministry of
Trade and Industry would work in close collaboration with TCU in announcing
and discussing the replanting scheme. Because of the zonal approach (para 15)
they can also restrict their work to specific zones in the project areas. The
Cooperative Division would be responsible for the organization or reorganiza
tion of cooperatives. Under their agreement with TCU smallholders would under
take to become member of cooperatives within one year. When trees are
mature these cooperatives would operate the Group Collection Centers (CCC's)
where the initial processing of smallholder latex into latex/coagulum would
take place. The Coopera~ives would be established within one year after
the Signing of the smallholder agreements and this would allow especially
the newly established cooperatives to gain some experience before they have
to operate the GCC's.

Training

22.       Technical training at all levels will comprise a very important
sector of project activity. To ensure an effective start up in 1976, inten
sive training in selected spheres such as nursery and field planting tech
niques will need to be initiated as soon as possible. The type of training
involved can be divided into the following categories: senior management
staff, agricultural officers, field assistants, budders, smallholders and
tappers. Details on training are given in Supplement 7.


                  B.    Mid-West Rubber Development Agency


Establishment of MRDA

23.       The Mid-West Rubber Development Agency (MRDA) was established
on November 5, 1970 under Edict No. 22 which defined its functions as follows:

     (a)  to establish and run commercial rubber estates, rubber process
          ing factories or rubber based industries, either alone or in
          partnership with other bodies;

     (b)  take over the management of existing State-owned rubber 

          plantations and rubber factories as may from time to time 

          be directed by the appropriate authority; 


     (c)  undertake the marketing of the Agency's produce or products;

     (d)  exercise partnership interests in a rubber plantation in 

          which the Government has vested financial interests; 

                                                             SUPPLEMENT 4
                                                             Page 8

      (e)  undertake promotional work for the development of the 

           rubber industries in the State; 


      (f)  keep the appropriate authority fully informed on all 

           matters relating to the Agency; and 


      (g)  perform such other functions as the appropriate authority 

           may, after due consultation with the Agency, from time to 

           time prescribe. 


24.       The edict transferred all Government-owned plantations and rubber
factories to MRDA. However, the liabilities of these plantations and factories
were not assumed by MRDA. The Urhonigbe Rubber Estate and the Ikpoba Rubber
Factory, formerly managed by the now dissolved Mid-Western Nigeria Develop
ment Corporation, and the Atochi Rubber Estate, previously managed by the
Nigerian Joint Agencies (NIJAL) were transferred to MRDA.

25.       Total area of Urhonigbe Rubber Estate is about 2,400 ha of which
about 2,370 ha are planted. Approximately 66% of area planted is 20 years
old. The estate's present rubber production is about 1,500 tons (details are
in table 3). Total area of Atochi Rubber Estate is about 2,000 ha of which
about 430 ha is planted. Planting started in 1968 and MRDA expects to finish
planting the whole area by 1977. The Ikpoba Rubber Factory, dates from 1955
and originally processed rubber sheets. Since 1958, however, it has produced
crepe (capacity 3,600 tons dry crepe rubber annually). In 1973 the factory
processed 1,035 tons crepe rubber and 0.7 ton rubber sheets (details are in
Table 4).

MRDA's Role in the Development of the Rubber Industry

26.       In an,effort to develop the rubber industry in the State and upgrade
the quality of rubber, MRDA introduced the Rubber Lumps Purchase Scheme, Rubber
Sheets Purchase Scheme, and the Smallholders Rubber Tapping Scheme.

          Rubber Lumps Purchase Scheme. MRDA launched the Rubber Lumps Pur
chase Scheme in June 1971, in order to check the adulteration of rubber lumps
and provide smallholders a higher return on their rubber. Under the scheme,
tappers are organized into groups called "Alliances" for the collection and
direct marketing of their lumps to factories. Alliances are grouped in
circles II for supervision purposes. MRDA provides the transportation without
cost to the tappers who are paid 3.3 kobo to 3.7 kobo per lb of rubber lumps
as against 1.3 kobo to 1.7 kobo formerly paid by middlemen. The factories pay
a guaranteed refund of 0.2 kobo per lb for transport, and also pay MRDA a com
mission of 0.2 kobo per lb to cover operating costs of the scheme. From 1971
to 1973 about 13,600 tons of lumps were sold under the scheme. Details are
shown in Table 5.


11    Presently there are five circles: Benin Circle, Ishan Circle, Urhonigbel
      Aboh Circle, Delta Circle, and Asab/lka Circle.
                                                            SUPPLEMENT 4
                                                            Page 9

28.       Rubber Sheets3ur£ha~e Scheme. Under this scheme MRDA purchases
poor quality rubber sheets from smallholders. These sheets are subsequently
refined and uPRraded and then sold through MRDA's normal marketing channels.
MRDA claims to offer higher prices to farmers than the middlemen. However,
this scheme has not been very successful.

29.       Smallholders Rubber Tapping Scheme. Under this scheme MRDA manages
private plantations generally under the following arrangements:

     (i)  capital expenditure i.e. latex cups, cup hangers etc., are
          borne by the plantation owner;

    (ii)  recurrent expenditure with respect to maintenance, tapping
          processing, marketing, etc., are deducted from revenue; and

   (iii)  profits are shared between the plantation owner and MRDA 

          in the ratio of 2 to 1 respectively but losses are borne by 

          MRDA. 


MRDA's  Present Situation

30.       Organizati~n and Management.  MRDA is headed by a General Manager
who is assisted by an Assistant General Manager. At the end of 1973, MRDA
had a staff of 63 and 1,597 daily paid laborers working at its estates and
factory. The present organization of MRDA is shown in Chart 9453 attached
to this Supplement.

31.        Resources and Operating Results. Total assets of MRDA as of
Oecember 31, 1971, its first full year of operations, stood at N539.1
thousand, rose to N720.0 thousand in 1972 and were over N1.0 million in 1973.
MRDA's comparative balance sheets are shown in Table 6. The overall operat
ing results of MRDA for the year ended 1971, 1972 and 1973 showed profits of
about N9,OOO - N32,OOO and N40,OOO respectively. (Comparative Profit and
Loss Statements are shown in Table 7). The surplus accumulated during 1971
1973 has been largely caused by the Urhonigbe Estate, which realized a total
net profit of about N120,OOO against a net loss of about N39,OOO incurred by
the Ikpoba factory. Comparative profit and loss statements of the Urhonigbe
Rubber Estate and Ikpoba Rubber Factory are shown in Table 8.

MRDA  Role in the Project

32.       In order to obtain better quality latex/coagulum from smallholders
for central processing, Group Collection Centers (GCC's), where initial pro
cessing of smallholder latex will take place, will be constructed by TCU. The
agreement between TCU and the smallholder will contain an undertaking by the
smallholder to bring his latex to his GCC's. The smallholder would also be a
member of the cooperative which operates "his" GCC. The coagulum would be
collected daily and transported to central processing factories. In view of
MRDA's experience under its Rubber Lumps Purchase Scheme (see para 27) it is
                                                            SUPPLEMENT 4
                                                            Page 10

considered a suitable entity to be responsible for the collection of coagulum
from Gee's and for transport to the factories. This arrangement would be
formalized by a signed agreement between MRDA and TCU. Provisions in the
agreement would include assurances from MRDA to daily collect the latex/
coagulum from all GCC's, provide adequate transport and deliver the latex/
coagulum to any technically acceptable processing factory offering what were
considered to be fair prices. For this service MRDA would be allowed a margin
to be paid by the factories at a rate to be agreed by the Rubber Price Policy
Committee (see Supplement 11).

33.       To ensure that MRDA performs this collection task effectively, some
modifications in its organizational structure would be desirable. Presently
(see chart 9453 attached to this Supplement), the estate and factory managers
report directly to the General Manager and Assistant General Manager. Each
estate and the factory performs a number of functions, one of which is the
operation of MRDA's schemes (see para 26). However, it would be better to
divide MRDA's activities into two functional areas: production, which would
include management of the estates and management of the rubber tapping scheme
(see para 29). and processing and collection, which would include MRDA's
Ikpoba factory and collection functions. The proposed organization is given
in chart 9454 attached to this Supplement. If MRDA besides collection of
project output from GCC's would continue to operate other collection activi
ties (for lumps and sheet, paras 27 and 28), its collection section should
keep its books and manage its operations in such a way that the different
collection-operation can be clearly distinguished.

34.       During the project period trials will be executed in order to gain
more experience with the initial processing of smallholder latex in GCC's and
the collection of latex/coagulum. MEU together with consultants would study
and evaluate these experiments (in 1979) and make specific recommendations
regarding the operation of GeC's and the organization of coagulum collection.
This would include an evaluation of MRDA's performance and recommendations
regarding the detailed changes in MRDA's organizational and operational pro
cedures in order for it to effectively carry out its collection task.


                    C.   Rubber Research Institute of Nigeria


35.       The Rubber Research Institute of Nigeria (RRIN) was established in
1961 by the then Western Region Government of Nigeria. With the creation of
the Mid-Western State in 1963, the responsibility of maintaining the Institute
fell on the Mid-Western State Government. The United States Agency for Inter
national Development (USAID) played a role in the development of the RRIN in
the early stages of its development, and when USAID withdrew its assistance
in 1971. it had spent about N400,OOO. Although the Institute came under the
Federal Republic of Nigeria's Institute Act of 1964. it was not until April 1,
1972 that the RRIN was financially controlled by FMG.
                                                             SUPPLEMENT 4
                                                             Page 11

36.       During the period 1961-1972 development of RRIN was hampered because
of the lack of adequate funding. Since FMG's take over of the funding of RRIN
the financial situation has improved. However,· other factors such as shortage
of housing still hamper the recruitment of experienced staff (see also Supple
ment 9). For 1972/73 FMG gave RRIN a subvention of N198,660 for its services.
For 1973/74 N956,000 was approved for capital and recurrent expenditures, while
the sum of N2.58 million was approved for 1974/75.

37.       The RRIN is situated in Iyanomo village, about 18 miles south of
Bening City on the Benin-Sapele road. Its main station there occupies area
of 2,079 ha (5,179 acres). RRIN has also a substation in Akwete, near Aba in
the East-Central State, which occupies an area of 300 ha (740 acres). RRIN
wishes also to establish substations in Rivers and South-Eastern States. The
RRIN has a total of 336 ha (840 acres) under rubber at its main station, where
a further 34 ha (85 acres) are being developed for 1974/75. In Akwete 50 ha
(125 acres) are under rubber.

38.       RRIN's main divisions are:

      (a)  Research and Development Division

      (b)  Advisory Services and Information Division

      (c)  Administration and Finance Division

39.       At the moment there is a small administrative/laboratory block,
built with help from USAID. The Soils and Plant Nutrition Diagnosis Laboratory
has been fully equipped. The Agronomy/Plant Physiology and the Plant Pathology
Laboratories are in the process of being equipped. For the Quality Control
Laboratory, only the building has yet been completed but equipment has been
ordered. Quality Control is important if Nigerian rubber is to meet interna
tionally acceptable standards.

40.       The RRIN lists as its main goals:

      (a)  the development of the main station site in order to supply
           facilities and administrative support for a rubber research scheme.

      (b)  the selection and training of staff and labor force capable of
           planning and carrying out a rubber research program, designed
           to meet the needs of the rubber producing and processing community.

      (c)  the initiation and development of a research program to obtain
           information, under local conditions, for transmittal to rubber
           growers in Nigeria.
                                                           SUPPLEMENT 4
                                                           Page 12

41.       Under the project RRIN would be responsible for building and
equipping a training school and engaging training instructors (provision
for three has been made under project costs) who will be responsible for
instruction in the initial years and who will also train counterparts.
In addition RRIN will also render its normal services to the replanting
program. Details are in Supplement 9.

42.       In view of the importance of applied research to the development of
a technically sound natural rubber sector. it is imperative tha~ funds and
facilities be provided to RRIN in order to allow it to e~ecute its research
program and other responsibilities. This has been provided for under the
Third National Development Plan.


                   D.   Monitoring and Evaluation Unit


43.       A Monitoring and Evaluation Unit (MEU) has been established under
the planning division of the Federal Department of Agriculture. The Tree
Crop Section of MEU (TCS/MEU) is being established in Benin as part of the
Nucleus Estate/Smallholder Oil Palm Project. Mid~estern State. 1/

44.       TCS/MEU would be responsible for: (i) the technical and financial
monitoring of ongoing projects; (ii) evaluating their financial. economic
and socio-economic impact; and (iii) providing assistance in the planning
and preparation of future development programs (details are in Supplement 2).
Beside this general function, in relation to all tree crop projects, TCS/MEU
would be specifically responsible under the project to make an evaluation
(together with consultants) of the trials with Group Collection Centers (for
details see Supplement 8) and to make recommendations regarding the organiza
tion of initial processing of smallholder latex and the collection of latex/
coagulum from Gee's. This study would take place in 1979. TCS/MEU would also
be responsible to make phase II investment proposals in 1979.

                Selected Staff Requirements of TCU


1·    TCU will be responsible for all treecrop projects in the Mid-western
State. It will be engaged in planting/replanting cocoa, oil palm and rubber.
Manpower requirements for TCU are significant and could affect manpower
availability for MANR. In that case, agricultural development in the Mid
Western State, other than in treecrops, would be hampered. The two main
categories in overall manpower requirements are Agricultural Officers (AO's)
and Agricultural Assistants (AA·s).
2.   Total AO's requirements for the TCU are as follows:

5.    MANR estimates its own requirement for !A's for all other projects
and work outside treecrops at approxiaately 45 annually. Thus total require
ment for !A's in the Mid-Western State is as follows:

Year              MANR                 TCU                     Total

1976               45                   69                     114
1977               45                   51                      96
1978               45                   38                      83
1979               45                   47                      92
1980               45                   40                      85
6.    A school of Agriculture has just been established in the Mid-Western
State. It will give 2-year courses starting from 1975. Its projected output
                                                                  SUPPLEMENT    4
                                                                  App endix 2
                                                                  Page 3
is estimated at approximately 50 in 1977 and 1978, and 100 in the years
thereafter. In addition, it is estimated that about 25 Mid-Westerners
finish their studies annually at schools of Agriculture in other States,
in particular the Akure School of the University of Ife and the Federal
School of Agriculture in the Umudike.

7.    Thus total output and requirements of AA' s compare as follows:
      Year                         Output                 Reguired

      1975                          25                     64 

      1976                          25                    114 

      1977                          75                     96 

      1978                          75                     83 

      1979                         125                     92 

      1980                         125                     85 

                                   Ii50                   ~         


8.     There is therefore a shortfall in output of AA's compared with
requirements in the 1975-19 &:> period which is especially severe in the
early years. It will be necessary to step up training. In addition,
suitable candidates will be hired by TeU, for AA's positions even though
these candidates do not have a formal AA education. They will be trained
by TeU in the specific extension duties they have to perform. If their
performance in the field is satisfactory, they will receive their formal
AA training at a later stage. This system has worked quite well in other
countries. Its advantage is that people are screened as to their capabilities
in agricultural work before formal training and only those who succeed
in the field will, in fact, receive formal training. If training is stepped
up and recruitment by Teu follows the practices described above, no major
staff constraints, both in TeU and in MANR are foreseen.

                              Planting Practices


                         A.    Planting Material


1.        Planting material for sma11ho1dings must be as high yielding as
possible and yet be resistent to wind damage which appears to be more frequent
and serious in Nigeria than most other rubber growing countries. The chosen
planting material should also be relatively resistant to leaf and panel di
seases because disease control is less likely to be effectively applied on
sma11ho1dings than on larger estates where supervision is more intensive.

2.        Clonal seedlings of good performance are relatively resistant
to wind damage and, under good management, can yield at the same level as all
but the clones in the highest yielding class. They have not been considered
for the Project for the following reasons:

     (a)  Susceptibility to brown bast makes S/2 d/3 67% the advisable
          tapping system. Smallholders would tend to tap them S/2 d/2
          100%. lj

     (b)  To obtain the highest yields per hectare, initial stands
          would have to be higher than for budded material, so that
          careful thinning under strict supervision must be carried out
          to remove the least desirable trees on the basis of both vigor
          and yield.

     (c)  Collection of clonal seeds requires careful supervision and
          the risk of illegitimate and unse1ected seeds being included
          is always present.

     (d)  There are not sufficient areas in Nigeria for the collection
          of suitable clonal seed.



1/  S/2 d/2 100% is the international nomenclature used for describing the
    intensity of a tapping system involving "half spiral cut of the tapping
    panel every alternate day"; S/2 d/3 67% being a "half spiral cut every
    third day".

                                                            Page 2

3.        The following clones have been chosen for the Project:

     (a)  Prang Besar 5/51 (PB 5/51) - this clone is in the highest
          yielding class and is resistant to wind damage because of
          its light branching habit. It is not particularly susceptible
          to panel or leaf diseases.

     (b)  Gunong Tapen 1 (GT 1) - this clone is in the higher yielding
          class and is resistant to wind damage. It is susceptible to
          Mouldy Rot (Ceratocystis fimbriata) of the tapping panel but
          this can be controlled.

     (c)  Proefstation 107 (PR 107) - this clone is resistant to wind
          damage but is susceptible to Black Stripe (Phytophthora
          palmivora) which can be controlled with panel dressings.
          PR 107 takes longer than other clones to reach its peak
          yields.

          In addition to the three chosen clones, Prang Besar 86 (PB 86)
might also be considered in future.

4.        RRIM 628, RRIM 623 and RRIM 600, all high yielding, have been
rejected mainly because of their susceptibility to wind damage. Furthermore,
RRIM 628 and RRIM 623 have thin renewed bark and are therefore not considered
suitable for smallholders. Harbel 1 was also considered, but there is insuffi
cient evidence of its performance in Nigeria on which to base a decision.

5.        In order that the smallholders should have plantings of similar
yield potential and so that risks from wind damage and diseases can be evenly
spread, it is recommended that where possible all three clones should be pre
sent on each smallholding. The clones should not be mixed but should be
planted in mono clone blocks. On the smaller holdings of about one ha, it may
not be feasible to plant all three clones but at least two should be planted.
It would be inadvisable to plant only PR 107 because early yields would be
lower than if either or both of the other clones were present.

6.        Yield projections for these recommended clones are in Supplement 10.

Seedling Stocks

7.         Seeds for stocks should be collected preferably from seed gardens
or from monoclonal blocks of clones known to produce vigorous seedlings (e.g.
Tjir 1, GT 1, RRIM 600, PB 5/51) or along the common boundaries of suitable
unrelated clones. Clones RRIM 600 and PB 5/51 are particularly liable to
produce a proportion of seedlings with genetic yellows and these should be
thinned from the nursery as soon as they are detected.
                                                            SUPPLEMENT 5
                                                            Page 3

Budded Stump Nurseries

8.        Under Nigerian conditions with the seed fall in August/September,
a dry season from November to early March and the most suitable period for
budding March/April it is necessary to bud seedlings either when they are 6
to 7 months old or when they are 18 to 19 months old. The suitability of
green budding cannot be assured and the use of polybags has been rejected
because of the difficulties and costs of transport to individual smallholdings.
The choice therefore, lies between brown budding in the nursery at 6 to 7
months or at 18 to 19 months. No evidence can be found to suggest that a
suitably high proportion of nursery seedlings would be buddable 6 to 7 months
after planting, even with chemical control of Helminthosporium leaf disease
and sprinkler irrigation. Research is required to see whether this is possi
ble. For the time being it has therefore been decided to recommend the brown
budding of 18 to 19 months old nursery seedlings.

9.        Seeds from stocks will be collected from clonal seed gardens, and
monoclone blocks of clones known to produce vigorous seedlings, in August/
September and put down to germinate in orthodox sand beds raised at least six
inches above ground level. In calculating seed requirements, 80% germination
has been assumed. Seed requirements are shown in Appendix 1. Planting will
be 30 em x 46 cm (1' x 1.5') and the individual beds will contain 1000 seed
lings (10 x 100). A plan of the nursery is detailed in Chart 9363 attached
to this Supplement. Budding will be done in March/April/May over a period
of about two months. In view of the relative inexperience of the budders, a
budding success of 65% has been assumed. It is further assumed that 60% of
the failures can be rebudded. In calculating the number of successful budded
stumps required, provision has been made for 10% losses in transit to the
field and for supplying 15% losses in the field.

10.       Because 18 month budded stump nurseries have been chosen while
field planting is yearly, it is necessary to have two nurseries in each of
the two Regions. Thus the nursery to produce budded stumps for planting in
year 0 will be laid down in August/September of year-2 and that to produce
budded stumps for planting in year 1 will be laid down in August/September
of year-l. These nurseries will accordingly overlap from August/September
in year-1 to May/June/July in year O. Later nurseries will overlap in a
similar manner. The nurseries should be on good soil, on a level site and
should be located where there is a reliable source of water.

11.       It is considered unnecessary to control Helminthosporium leaf
disease or to irrigate by sprinkler because the seedlings will be of adequate
size for budding after 18 months in the nursery despite periods of dry weather
and attacks by Helminthosporium. If the results of proposed research prove
satisfactory, there is a possibility that the later Project nurseries may be
of shorter duration (budding 6-7 months after planting) with the introduction
of effective disease control and irrigation.

12.       An operations calendar for the first budded stump nurseries, planted
in 1975 is shown in Chart 9364 attached to this Supplement. Subsequent nur
series, planted in 1976, 1977, 1978 and 1979 will follow the same course of
operations. Details of land required for budded stump nurseries and budded
stump nursery requirement per ha at field planting costs are given in Appen
dices 2, 3 and 4.

13.       The quantities of budwood and budded stumps required for the
five years of field planting are given in Appendix 5.

Budwood Multiplication Nurseries

14.       Budwood for budding the budded stump nurseries will be supplied
from budwood multiplication nurseries located at each of the four regions.
The multiplication nurseries are designed to produce sufficient budwood for
the 2000 hectares to be planted in the field in year O. It is assumed that
one yard of budwood would be produced per nursery point during the first
year. At the second "cutting back" each point should produce two yards of
budwood and at the third and subsequent "cutting back" three yards of budwood
so that, unlike the seedling nurseries, the multiplication nurseries need
not be expanded as the field plantings increase year by year. The multipli
cation nurseries will be planted 3' x 2' giving 18150 points/hectare.

15.       Budwood must be available in March/April/May in year 0 so that the
latest date for planting the multiplication nurseries with budded stumps is
June/July in year -1 (1976).

16.       The stocks and the selected budwood for establishing the multipli
cation nurseries would be supplied from rubber estates, Ogbafarm and the
RRIN. The detailed requirements are shown in Appendix 6. It is essential
that the identity of the budwood is confirmed before multiplication commences.

17.       An operation calendar for the multiplication nurseries planted in
year -1, is shown in Chart 9362 attached to this Supplement. Detail of land
required for multiplication nurseries requirement of budwood multiplication
nurseries and their estimated costs are given in Appendices 2, 7, and 8.

           B.  LAND PREPARATION AND PLANTING TECHNIQUES DURING
                         IMMATURE AND MATURE PHASES


General

18.       The Tree Crop Unit (TCU) will plan its program so as to concentrate
smallholder replantings in specific zones during any given ye~r. Prior to
initial inspection of holdings by TCU field staff smallholders would be
requested to cut a trace demarcating the perimeter boundaries of the area
scheduled for replanting. This procedure would be adopted so as enable any
boundary disputes being settled prior to appraising applications.

19.       There are indications from the gappy nature of the stands on small-
holding rubber that root disease could be an important hazard to new plantings.
It is generally considered that the surest method of controlling root disease
is to ringbark and poison the old trees. Holdings would be underbrushed and
trees of a 50 cm diameter and over poisoned about two months (but not less
than six weeks) before felling; it is estimated that about 500 trees would be
poisoned per ha. About 20 cm of bark would be stripped, 70 cm from ground
level and a sodium arsenite paste painted on the wood. Field staff of the
TCU will supervise the preparation of the paste which must be applied
immediately and not stored. Some authorities also recommend the application
of creosote to the top of the stump, particularly in areas of high infection,
but under the prevailing conditions, this operation is not deemed essential.

Land Clearing, Years -1 and 0 
                                 11

20.       After underbrushing and tree poisoning has been completed by the
smallholders, tree felling and cutting will be undertaken by contractors
employed by the TCU; the cost would be charged to the credit account of the
smallholders. Proposals for the organization of this operation are detailed
at Appendix 9.

21 .      All other operations will be undertaken by the smallholder and his
family but there will be frequent supervisory visits by the field staff of the
TCU. (See Supplement 4). The smallholder will be left with timber cut into
2 m lengths which will have a saleable value as firewood or for other purposes,
such as charcoal or chip board (see Appendix 10). This has to be cleared off
the felled area and stacked for disposal; the brushwood can then be heaped and
fired. Appendix 11 shows that 60 and 20 mandays (m.d.) II respectively have
been allowed for stacking timber and burning brushwood. The latter operation
may run into mid-February of the year of planting, i.e., Year O.


11    Year 0 is year of planting.

21    The labor and non-labor inputs used in this supplement are mission
      estimates based on an assessment of local smallholders and estate
      replanting practices as well as rubber planting under similar
      ecological conditions in West Africa.
                                                            SUPPLEMENT 5
                                                            Page 6

Preparation of Land for Planting, Years - 1 and 0

22.       ~len the land has been cleared, an agricultural assistant of the
Teu will arrange for it to be lined and pegged at a spacing of 6.7 x 3.4 m
(22 x 11 ft), i.e., 450 trees per hectare. The owner would be expected to
assist and to provide pegs.

23.       Holes of 450 x 450 x 750 rom (t8 x 18 x 30 in) size tapering slightly
to 350 x 350 rom (14 x 14 in) at the base would then be dug. Stumps will pave
to be removed where they coincide with or are close to the planting position;
it has been estimated that about 20 to 25 large stumps per hectare may have
to be removed. This work should be completed well before the rubber is due
to be planted as the avenues between the planting rows have to be prepared
for intercropping. Intercropping is discussed in part D of this Supplement.

Immature Rubber, Planting and Maintenance, Years 0-5

24.       Planting. Each smallholder will be supplied with 500 budded stumps
per hectare in Year a for planting over the period mid-May to mid-July. At
least two clones will be provided for planting in monoclonal blocks. 1/ At
planting rock phosphate (up to 100 gm per plant) will be placed in the plant
ing hole. Stumps must be planted firmly with the bud patch at 25-50 rom above
ground level. Later planting is not advised as growth will be unsatisfactory
during the heavy rains and the plants may not survive the dry season. It will
help the young rubber through the dry season if, after the intercropped maize
has been harvested and before the end of the rains, the stover is placed as
a mulch in a ring around each plant but not less than about 8 cm from the
trunk. The mulch should, however, not come in contact with the bole of the
tree. It is anticipated that there will be not more than 15% vacancies to
supply in Year 1.

25.        Weedin~.  All weeding will be manual. There will be clean weeding
in the rows to a width of 2 meters, 1 meter on each side of the planting line.
~10nthly rounds have been allowed in the year of planting, Year O. Siam weed
(Eupatoriu~) must be forked out as it is a rank grower and can rapidly swamp
the young rubber; stands of Panicum and Pennisetum grasses may have to be
treated in the same way. Thereafter rounds and man-days per round have been
progressively reduced but this can be achieved only if the smallholder is
fully aware of the importance of timely weeding, i.e., at a stage before the
weeds are able to seed themselves.



1/  Holdings of less than 2 ha would be planted with two clones on
    holdings of 2 ha or more all three recommended clones should be
    planted in monoclonal blocks.
                                                            SUPPLEMENT 5
                                                            Page 7

26.       M~nurj~n~. The importance of fertilizer to promote growth in the
enrly years is fully recognized, but levels have been reduced below those
recommended by the RRIN to take account of the effect of intercropping (see
Appendix 12). There are reports of magnesium deficiency in the Benin soils
and the use of 15.15.6.4 (NPKMg) mixture has been assumed. There is as yet
insufficient experimental evidence in favor of split dressings and a single
manuring round in August in Year 0 and in April in subsequent years is recom
mended. It should be applied as a 30 cm wide band at 30 cm from the base pf
the tree and worked into the soil.

27.       Cover Cro~. Early in year 2, after the intercropped cowpeas have
been harvested, the avenues should be prepared for planting double lines of
the leguminous cover crop, Pueraria phaseoloides. If the seed is not very
fresh, it should be pretreated by immersion in hot water to ensure a good
germination. Two parts of boiling to one part cold water should be poured
over the seed with continued stirring - seed should be left to cool two
hours after which water should be drained off and the seed allowed to dry
overnight. (A suitable water treatment is described in Rubber Research
Institute of Malaysia's Planters Bulletin 39 of 1958).

28.       Routine Maintenance. As soon as the bud has grown 15 cm, adventi
tious shoots must be removed from the stock. Later, as growth continues,
side shoots must be removed, at least to a height of 2 m preferably 3 m, so
as to provide a clean trunk for the tapping panel. During the early inspec
tion rounds a watch must be kept for snail and rodent damage. In Years 3 to
5, weak growing trees should be eradicated. Where young trees are leaning
over, they should be pulled to an upright position by rope stays pegged in
the ground. During the dry season there will be a danger of fire from
neighboring farms, particularly where arable crops are being grown, and one
man-day per hectare has been allowed for demarcating a firebreak. Details
of immature rubber maintenance are in Appendix 12.

29.       Root Disease Control. The two most important root diseases occuring
in the areas involved are the while root disease Rigidoporus lignosus and to
a lesser extent the brown root disease, Phellinus noxius. Foliar inspections
should commence in Year 2; young trees detected as infected at that age would
not be treatable and would therefore be eradicated. The collars of neighboring
trees at the next planting points in the row should be inspected and treated
as necessary. The source of infection, most likely an old stump, will
usually be apparent during inspection and this, too, should be eradicated.
If the source lies to one side or other of the planting row, the collars of
neighboring trees in the adjacent row should also be inspected. When collar
inspecting, the opening must be sufficient to expose the underside of the
lateral roots. If infected, the diseased portions of the roots should be
romoved and the cut surface should be treated with a formulation containing
15% pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB or quintozene). Suitable formulations in
Nigeria are Fomac 2 or Agrisol or a similar formulation could be made up by
the project using a bitumen emulsion as carrier. The dressing should be
applied in a band for about 5 cm above and below the lateral roots and out
wards on the upper and lower surfaces of affected roots for about nine inches.
The above routine should be undertaken at least at six-monthly intervals.
                                                           SUPPLEMENT 5
                                                           Page 8

Mature Rubber, Maintenance, Years 6 to 8 and onwards

30.       General maintenance will continue as for immature rubber but at a
reduced level, particularly for weeding, after the establishment of a cover
crop: additionally, rubber seedlings will have to be eradicated. There
will be some losses due to root disease, for which there should be a yearly
inspection, and it is anticipated that by Years 6 to 7 the stand will have
been reduced by root disease and by the removal of weak growers to about 400
to 420 per ha. Provision has been made for one round of root disease control.

31.       By March of Year 6, the young rubber will have reached an age of
69/70 months. The Teu will, therefore, undertake a census of newly-planted
rubber in December of Year 5 to assess the number of tappable trees. It is
assumed at least 50% of the stand will then have attained a tappable girth
of 50 cm at 150 cm height from ground level.

32.       Because the standards of tapping have been very low, smallholders
will be expected to attend a practical course on the marking and opening of
panels, tapping and the tapping system to be used, hygiene including panel
disease control and the cleaning of equipment, particularly tapping knives,
spouts and cups, and the collection and preparation of the crop for despatch
to the processing factory. This would take place about October/December of
year 5. (details on tapping training are given in Supplement 7).

33.       Tapping will commence in the dry season. During the rains, April
to October, two diseases are likely to occur on the tapping panel, black
stripe (Phytophthora sp) and mouldy rot (Ceratocystis fimbriata). These will
have to be controlled with a suitable fungicide starting at two rounds per
month and increasing to four to six rounds during the months July to October.
At Appendix 13 the use of captafol (Difolatan 80% WP) has been assumed as it
has proved superior in trials in West Africa, to Waxrex Treseal, Shell TB192,
Brunolinum Plantarium, Mycocide Latex (organo-mercury) and Antimucin. However,
it is expensive and can induce allergic responses to the skin if handled fre
quently. It might be safer to use a prophylactic which would give a lesser
degree of protection but which could be applied more simply. preferably as a
grease which could be smeared on the panel, however, captafol will soon be
available in Nigeria as a flowable colloid and will then be safer to handle.
It is likely that captafol will also be needed by cocoa growers for the
control of black pod, a disease caused by the same pathogen as for black
stripe.

34.       Equipment for tapping and disease control will be supplied to the
smallholder on a credit basis after satisfactory completion of this training
and when the required number of trees have attained a tappable size. Items
required are listed at Appendix 13.

35.       There has been no provision for manuring mature rubber since the
effects of fertilizers are generally marginal except in problem areas. How
ever, it is recommended that the nutritional status of smallholding rubber
                                                            SUPPLEMENT 5
                                                            Page 9

be monitored by RRIN on representative farms in each sector by the analysis
of leaf samples on a routine basis; in certain areas potash and magnesium
levels may require correcting.

36.       Operationa Calendar. Charts 9319 and 9320 attached to this Supple
ment give an operations calendar for planting and maintenance of one ha of
rubber. A similar calendar would also be used for instruction and training
purpose.


                          C.   Tapping Systems


37.       Half spiral alternate daily tapping (S/2 d/2 100%) is recommended
for all the replantinga in the Project. Clones PR 107 and GT 1 respond well
to full or three quarters spiral tapping, but it is considered that it would
be difficult to achieve the desired standard of tapping with cuts longer
than spiral or on any system of changeover of panels. Clone PB 5151 responds
best to S/2 d/2 100% tapping and does not respond well to increased length
of cut.

38.       The panels should be opened at 152 cm (60") from the ground and
the angle of the cut should be 30 0 running from high left to low right. Trees
will be opened when they reach a girth of 51 cm, at 152 cm height.

39.       Tapping should be continuous through panels A, B, C and D except
for a month's rest during the wintering period. After the completion of
tapping the second panel of first renewal (D), intensive tapping should be
practiced. The method of intensive tapping would be chosen in the light of
experience at that time.

40.       Bark consumption should not be more than one inch per month.   Thus
each of the four panels A, B, C and D should last for five years.

41.       The opening of all trees, including marking the panel guidelines,
will be done under the supervision of Agricultural Assistants who will use a
template designed to enable the panel to be marked in a way that delineates
the slope of the cut and marks bark consumption levels during the first six
months of tapping. If considered necessary the second six months bark con
sumption would be marked in a similar mannger. Thereafter the amount of bark
to be consumed each six months will be marked. The marking of the lines show
ing the monthly consumption rate could be done with a flexible metal stencil
and a sharp pOinted metal prong. The prong would not be more than 1.5 mm long
so that the bark would be penetrated only to the cork cambium. The lactiferous
tissue would not be damaged.

42.       The tapping task will be one hectare containing initially 450 trees
at 6.7 m x 3.4 m (22' x 11') spacing. By the time tapping commences, the
stand will have been reduced by natural losses and runts to 400 - 420 trees.
                                                             SUPPLEMENT 5
                                                             Page 10

Tapping will start in March. 5 years and 8 months after planting when it is
expected that 50% of the trees will be tappab1e. By the following October,
it is expected that a further 25% of the trees will be tappab1e and within
the following year all the remaining trees should be tappab1e. The tapping
tasks will therefore start at about 200 trees increasing through 300 to about
400.

43.       No yield stimulation will be practiced until after 10 years of
tapping. At that time it is possible that yield stimulants w~ll be applied.
The method of stimulation would be decided in the light of knowledge at th4t
time.


                           D.   Intercropping


General

44.       In order that the smallholder may realize some cash income before
the rubber comes into tapping, it is proposed that intercrops will be planted
during years 0 and 1. Under the taungya system, which was introduced by the
forestry services in Mid-Western State in the 1920's, there is a long history
of growing food crops in newly-planted tree crops. Planting is usually rather
haphazard and a wide spacing is enforced to allow the development of the
forest trees. However, in the case of the present project the rubber rows
will be 6.7 m (22 feet) apart and the farmer would be expected to confine
his food crops to the avenues keeping the rubber rows clean weeded. More
than half of the area could be cropped but, as there will be many old rubber
stumps, it is estimated that not more than half a hectare 11 will, in effect,
be planted in each hectare cleared.

45.       It is important that the land is cultivated throughout the rainy
season as otherwise a weed problem could build up to the detriment of the
young rubber. For this reason short-term annual crops are recommended. It
is envisaged that most of the areas replanted to rubber will be suitable for
planting to maize. The more acid and less we11-drained soils might be suitable
for upland rice. In some areas, e.g., around Agbor, yams are a crop permitted
by the Forestry Department to be grown under the taungya system.

4u.       The Operation Calendar attached to this Supplement shows only
two possible cropping systems with either maize followed by cowpeas or rice
and cowpeas. However, yams would be allowed in year O. A planting plan is
given in the Chart 9349 attached to this Supplement and should be followed
as far as the old rubber stumps permit. The cropping schedule will be


11    50% of area is assumed for maize, yams and cowpeas, 60% is assumed for
      upland rice.
                                                               SUPPLEMENT 5
                                                               Page 11

repeated in year 1 except where yams are planted in year 0; yams will be
followed by maize and cowpeas in year 1. Details of the labor and fertilizer
inputs are given at Appendix 14, tables 1 through 4.

47.       Although cowpeas are at present considered to be the most suita
ble crop to plant towards the end of the rains, the International Institute
for Tropical Agriculture (IITA) is examining several alternatives. The most
promising is a dwarf, precocious (120 days) stratn of pigeon pea for which
labor inputs would be rather less than for cowpeas; yet higher yields are
claimed. Pigeon peas could be interplanted in maize just before the latter
is harvested. No response had been demonstrated to fertilizers at Ibadan
but insect attacks on the developing pods had to be controlled with azodrin
from flowering onwards; this is a serious disadvantage as the smallholder will
be growing annual crops for only two years and this is too short a period to
justify the purchase of costly spraying equipment.

48.       Of other possible crops, cassava is not considered suitable for
interplanting in rubber because it can be a carrier of the same root disease
as that affecting rubber; furthermore, cassava is not usually weeded to a
sufficiently high standard. Pineapples have never proved a profitable crop
in Mid-Western State as the market is limited; they could possibly be grown
in limited quantities, especially to mark farm boundaries. Cocoyams and
sweet potatoes have also been considered but are not likely to yield the
cash return of the other crops detailed below; cocoyams suppress weeds very
well but there is also some evidence from taungya plantings that their
presence has led to the failure of a tree crop. The planting of plantains
and bananas should be prohibited as, unless strictly controlled and removed
by the end of year 2, they will compete with the young rubber.

49.       Under the project, TCU would nrovide seeds and fertilizer to
the smallholders on a seasonal credit basis. Labor required for intercropping
would be provided by the smallholder and has not been taken into account in
determining project costs 11. Assumptions on the area usages for different
intercropping patterns are in Appendix 15.

Maize

50.         Early planting is essential for best yields from maize and the
land must   be ready by late March. Allowance must be made for losses due to
birds and   rats; therefore, a fairly high rate of sowing, 30 kglha, has been
assumed.    Spacing would be at 80 x 30 cm x 3 seeds (45,OOO/ha) thinning to
one after   germination.

51.       The Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR) currently
recommends the yellow varieties NS 1 and Western Yellow and the white varieties
Diacol and Lagos White. However, better varieties are now becoming available
in small quantities from the IITA, Ibadan, and it is recommended that MANR
should start to bulk them up for distribution to local farmers. The TZB


11      They have of course been taken into account for calculating the rate of
        return and preparing farm budgets.
                                                            SUPPLEMENT 5
                                                            Page 12

series of composites is the most promising at present available; TZB is a
tallish strain but strong-stemmed and, therefore, resists lodging. There is
also a short-stemmed strain, TZPB, the advantage of which is that it would
not shade the young rubber.

52.       Two rounds of fertilizer are proposed, at planting and at five to
six weeks later. The 15.15.15 fertilizer mixture, currently recommended by
the MANR, is accepted by the mission until experimental evidence comes forward
for a formulation more suitable for the sandy soils of the area.

53.       The maize stalk borers, Sesamia calamistis and Eldana saccharina
are difficult to control. The use of insecticides requires too many applica
tions to be economical and most of the entomological work on maize has empha
sized the development of resistant varieties. The incidence of stalk borer
is reduced with early-planted maize. Damage by the cob-borer and weevils can
be much reduced by harvesting as soon as the cobs are ripe. Drying is then
the main problem and it is usual for villagers to hang their maize on the cob
in the rafters of the house where it can be smoked dry. The maize must, in
any case, be harvested without delay in August so that the land can be prepared
for planting to cowpeas.

54.       netails of inputs are given at Appendix 14, Table 1. Five man-days
are allowed for harvesting but none for subsequent handling. Under the
taungya system an additional three man-days per 1/2 ha were required for dry
ing and a further 13 man-days for shelling and bagging. The calculations at
Appendix 14, Table 1 have been made on the assumption that the maize is sold
on the cob.

Upland Rice

55.       Unless the soil reaction can be corrected for maize, as suggested
in the notes of Appendix 14, table 2, upland rice is likely to do better than
maize on the more acid soils, i.e., of less than pH 5.6. The soil moisture
must be right when planting rice and this is not likely to occur before early
to mid-April. Therefore, in order to save time, it is recommended that the
smallholder be taught to pre-soak the seed for 12 hours and leave in the
shade to complete germination. The chit ted seed should then be sown at about
1 cm depth in rows at a spacing of 30 x 30 cm with three to five seeds per
hole.

56.       MANR recommends the variety OS6 which is tall and does well without
fertilizer. It takes 120 days to reach maturity and should therefore be ready
to harvest by mid to end August. Other strains on trial at IITA are promising
and one or two of the irrigated lines, e.g., IR269, have proved adaptable to
upland conditions but require fertilizer. The fertilizer mixture recommended
(see Appendix 14, table 2) could be improved, but this must be subject to the
results of trials yet to be undertaken.
                                                            SUPPLEMENT 5
                                                            Page 13

57.       OS6 is susceptible to stalk borers and, as no insecticidal control
is proposed, the assumed yields have been adjusted accordingly. Birds are a
problem whilst the crop is ripening and the smallholder will have to employ
his children to scare birds for about a month.

Cowpeas

58.       In order to make full use ot the rains and residual moisture at
the end of the rains, cowpeas should be planted, if possib1e~ by the end
of August for best yields and certainly not later than mid-September. This
emphasizes the importance of early planting and timely harvesting of the
preceding crops, maize and upland rice. Upland rice is usually ready for
harvesting a week or two later than maize and the planting schedule for cow
peas then becomes tighter; they may have to be planted in the rice stubble
(see Operations Calendar attached to this Supplement). Optimum spacing is
90 x 23 cm. Rock phosphate is recommended at planting time but fertilizer
trials are required for cowpeas on the Benin sands.

59.       Seed is available from MANR of the varieties Nigeria A7, B4 and
Kano 1696. In Western State Ife Brown and Prima are popular. However, these
varieties are very susceptible to pests, mainly thrips and leaf hoppers, and
diseases, mainly virus, which if not controlled will result in poor yields.
IITA now have some vary promising resistant, vigorous and high yielding strains
under the code symbol TVU. Villagers prefer white or buff seeded varieties
but these new strains produce seeds dark red (e.g., TVU 1190) or light red
(e.g., TVU 201) in color with tough testas and it may be necessary to popula
rize them. If insecticides are not to be used, it would appear essential for
the project to obtain seed of resistant varieties and to bulk them up as
rapidly as possible.

60.       The labor and material inputs for cowpeas are given at Appendix 14,
table 3. There should be at least two rounds of weeding one soon after plant
ing and the other at four weeks. Cowpeas should be harvested by the end of
the year, about three rounds of harvesting being necessary.
Yams

61.       Yams are popular in the more fertile and well-drained soils east of
Benin where there will undoubtedly be a demand to plant them in the young
rubber. Because they grow to a height of· eight feet, there is the danger of
shading; this could be minimized by adopting a planting arrangement, as far
as the old rubber stumps allow, as shown in the chart attached to this Annex.
This is a staggered planting based on the recommended spacing of 1.5 x 1 m.
Planting could be permitted in Year 0 but not in Year 1, when maize would be
planted instead. This is because of the danger of dieback problems, caused
by a buildup in the nematode population.
                                                           SUPPLEMENT 5
                                                           Page 14

62.       There are no improved varieties yet available. The most popular
is the white yam (Dioscorea rotundata) but the red and yellow yam (D. cayenen
sis) is also grown. Setts are usually available at five kobo each although
the price is sometimes as low as N 3 per 200 and some farmers will use their
own stock. They should be planted when the soil has been well wetted, late
April to early May. Appendix 14, table 4 shows that yams are a labor inten
sive crop and could, therefore, be grown only by the rubber planter who can
command adequate labor resources. The digging of mounds is labor consuming
and on well-drained soils planting on the flat is satisfactory. No allowance
has, therefore, been made for mounding. In some areas the "seed" must be
protected against yam beetle but this is not a problem in Mid-Western State.
It is assumed that 10% of the setts will fail to germinate and will have to be
replanted. Bamboos are readily available for staking.

63.       Weeding is important for the first three months and three rounds
are assumed. Weeding should not be done near harvesting time as root rots
may occur. High rates of fertilizer are not needed: high nitrogen can lead
to storage problems. The 20.20.20 mixture is recommended by MANR but ferti
lizer trials are required and the mission assumes the use of the standard
15.15.15 mixture for the time being. Yields from a good stand should be
around 10 ton/ha, the crop being harvested September to mid-october. This is
too late for planting cowpeas and, if that crop is to follow, the yams will
have to be interplanted. A price of R 70 per ton has been assumed at Appendix
14, table 4, but this price will vary considerably according to the season,
exceeding R 130 per ton at certain times of the year and falling to R 50
during times of glut. Storage is the main problem and the farmer who can
keep his yams through the dry season will obtain the highest price.

Budded Stump Nursery Requirement per ha of Field Planting

1.        450 budded stumps are planted per ha in the field. Allowing
for      10% loss in transit to the field, and for supplying 15% vacancies
in the field, 566 successfUl buddings must be prepared in the nursery.

2.        In order to prepare 566 successful budddings,               \220 seeds must
be collected. The calculations are given below:

              (a)    }200 seeds at          80% genninationgive 960 germinated
                     seeds.

              (b)  Allowing for 20% (960 x 20% .. 192) rogues, thinning
                   and unbuddable seedlings and 5% (960 x 5% = 48) for
                   budding training, leaves 120 (960 - 240) buddable
                   seedlings.

              (c)    120 budded seedlings at 65% success give 468
                     successful buddings. Rebudding 60% of the
                     failures (120 - 468 = 252 x 60% = 151) at 65%
                     success give 98 (151 x 65%) successful budding
                     making a total of successful budding of
                     468   +   98   ==   566.
3.        The budded stump nurser,y is planted at 30 x 45 cm (1' x 1.5')
giving 72,600 seedlings per ba. 960 seedlings are required to produce the
566 budded stumps required for 1 ha of field planting. Therefore, the
area of budded stump nurser,y required is 960 ., 12,600 = 0.0132 ha.

4.            One ha o£ budded stump nursery can produce budded stumps for
1 .. 0.0132    == 76 ha of field planting.

5.        Allowing 20% of total nurser,y area for roads and paths, the
area required for budded stumps nurser,y to supply stumps for 1 ha of field
planting is (0.0132 x 100) ., 80 = 0.0165 ha.·

= 8.5 kobo per stump. During the second to fifth years of budding, the Bud
wood nursery is already established and Establishment Costs are charged
to first year of budding. Thus costs per stump are (2,647 x 100) .. 42,825

           Requirements and source of budwood and seedlings
           for the Project budwooq multiElication nurseries



          The requirements of budwood for budding the budwood nurseries in
1·
Year ° for the planting of 2,050 hectares in the field is 150,000 made up of
50,000 yards of each of the clones GT 1, PH 107 and PB 5/51 ·

2.        To obtain this budwood from the Project budwood mult:iplication
nurseries, the requirements are calculated as follows;

           (a)  1 hectare of multiplication nursery planted at 3' x 2' contains
                18,150 points.

           (b)  To plant one hectare of MUltiplication nursery allowing for
                65:' budding success and for supplying 25i' of the points, requires
                34,900 buddable seedlings (34,900 x 65) · 100 x 80 · 100 = 1B,150.

           (c)  Allowing for 8~ losses in the nursery and one yard of budwood
                from each surviving point at first cutting back (1 B, 150 x 92)
                · 100 = 16,700 yards of budwood will be available at first
                cutting back.

           (d)  150,000 yards are required in year   °(1977), therefore, the
                area of mul tip11cation nursery required is 150,000 · 16,700
                = 9 (say 10) hectares. Including roads 12.5 hectares will be
                required.

           (e)  At 12 usable buds per yard the yardage of budwood required to
                bud stocks for 1 hectare of multiplication nursery is 34,900
                · 12  = 2,90B (say 3,000).

           (f)  The yardage of budwood required to bud stocks for 10 hectares
                of multjplication n'\lrsery is therefore 10 x 3,000 == 30,000.

3.         The 10 hectares of multiplication nursery would be distributed as
follows:

4.        The 30,000 yards of budwood required muet be obtained from estates#
including Ogba farm and RRIN.

5.        Using seed from the seedfall in 1975 (year -2) is not possible
because the resultant seedlings would not be buddable until March/April 1977
(year 0). Therefore, the 34,900 x 10 = 349,000 buddable seedling must be
found on estates, including Ogba farm and the RRlN.

6.        The latest date on which the seedlings for the multiplication
nursery can be budded is March/April 1976 (year -1) for planting as budded
stuqJ8 in May/June/July 1976 80 that budwood would be available in March!
April 1977 (year 0).

7.        It should be borne in mind that some ot the budwood required for
budding the budded stump nursery in year   °
                                           could be obtained from the same
sources as the budwood for the multiplication nurseries.

8.       It is essential that all budwood be    proper~   identified before
use on multiplication.

3.        At 12 usable buds per yard of budwood, 871 + 12 yards of budwood
are required · 73 per hectare of field planting.

4.        The budwood multiplication nursery is planted 3' x 2' giving
18,150 points per hectare.

5.        Each point at first cutting back will produce one yard of budwood
(see 11 below). Allowing for 8% vacancies there will be 16,700 points giving
16,700 yards of budwood.

6.        Because 73 yards of budwood are required per hectare of field
planting and because each hectare of multiplication nursery produces 16,700
yards of budwood at first cutting back, the area of multiplication nursery
required to supply budwood for each hectare of field planting is 73 + 16,700
- 0.0044 ha. The ratio of the area of multiplication nursery to the area of
budded stump nursery is therefore 0.0044:0.0132 - 1:3.
7.        Allowing 20% of total budwood multiplication nursery for roads and
paths, the area required for the budwood multiplication nursery to supply
0.~132 hectares of budded stump nursery is (0.0044 x 100) + 80 - 0.0055.

8.        1 hectare of budwood multiplication nursery will produce budwood
for 1 + 0.0044 - 227 hectares of field planting at the first cutting back.
2,050 hectares will be planted in year 0 making a requirement of 2,050 + 27
- 9 hectares of multiplication nursery - say 10-. There would be 4 hectares
in the Benin region and 2 hectares in each of the other 3 regions.

9.        The areas required for the budwood multiplication nurseries includ
ing roads, in the four regions will be, for the first planting in year 0:

           Total: 2,050 hectares planted, say 12.5 hectares of
             budwood multiplication nursery.

10.       The 12.5 hectares of budwood multiplication nursery will be suffi
cient to supply budwood for all subsequent field planting as 2 yards of bud
wood will be produced at the second cutting back and at least 3 yards in the
third and subsequent cuttings back.

11.       The budwood shoots will only be 10 to 11 months old when they are
cut for budwood in March/April/May in year O. It is by no means certain that
1 yard of budwood with 12 usable buds will be available from each of the
16,700 points per hectare in the multiplication nursery. Assuming that 60%
of the 16,700 points per hectare can produce 1 yard of budwood in year 0,
about 100,000 yards of budwood would be produced in the 10 hectares of mul
tiplication nursery. Assuming the remaining 40% of the points can produce
1/2 yard of usable brown budwood, the equivalent of about 33,000 yards would
be produced making the total 133,000 yards, leaving a short fall of about
17,000 yards in the total of 150,000 yards required. In June/July 1975 the
RRIN intends to plant 2 hectares of multiplication nursery, equally divided
between the three recommended clones. If the RlIN keeps to this schedule
there should be an ample supply of budwood of the three recommended clones
by March of year 0 (1977). Some budwood of the recommended clones will also
be available from Ogba and commercial Estates.

                       SMALLHOLDER RUBBER PROJECT

                            MID-WESTERN STATE


                The Organization and Cost of Felling and
                    Cutting Timbers Using Contractors


1.        The task of felling his rubber trees and clearing the land for
replanting is more than the average smallholder would be able to take in
hand. The mission has, therefore, proposed that felling and cutting up the
timber be undertaken by contractors using chainsaws and axes. It is esti
mated that this would save 40 man-days of the smallholders' time for each
hectare to be replanted, plus the cost of hiring and operating chainsaws.

2.        The cost of the above operations has been estimated to be about
M 170 per hectare as shown below. This figure could be used as a basis
for engaging contractors. However, enquiries have revealed that, for the
scale of operations required over the period of development, it is unlikely,
at least in the first year or so, that there will be sufficient contractors
available and it may be necessary for the project to train its own felling
gangs to be employed direct by the project or on a contract basis, the equip
ment to be hired.

3.        Once the timber has been felled and cut into six-foot lengths, it
will be for the smallholder to heap it and to burn the brushwood. The timber
would be sold or used as firewood (see Appendix 10).

4.         Costs per ha are as follows:

      Overhead for 20 chainsaw days at N 4.00                    M 80.00

      Felling:  4 chainsawmen each for 2.5 days at M 2.00        M 20.00
                4 axemen each for 2.5 days at N 1.00             M 10.00

      Cutting:  4 chainsawrnen each for 2.5 days at M 2.00       M 20.00
                4 axemen each for 2.5 days at M 2.00             M 10.00

                                                                M 140.00
      Margin to contractor (estimated at 20%)                      28.00

           Total                                                M 168.00

Based on this calculation, it has been estimated that bids of contractors
for felling and cutting would amount to M 168.

General

1.        Assuming that 625 old rubber trees per ha have to be felled and
assuming that each tree has an average volume of 20 cubic feet 1/, thus
12,500 cubic feet per ha, the volume available over the five years would
be approximately:

                                                        Volume                    11
~         Replanted Area (ha)        (million cubic feet)   (million cubic me ters)-

1977             2,000                        25                     0.70

1978             3,000                       40                      1.12

1979             4,000                        50                     1.40

1980             5,000                        60                     1.68

1981             6,000                        75                     2.10
       TOTAL                                 250                     7.00


/1     One cubic foot    = 0.028   cubic meters.
2.        It is evident that there is a good outlet for this timber to nearby
villages and towns for firewood and obviously the farmer would use part of
the timber for his own firewood needs. Prices for firewood range from N 0.40
to N 1.00 a tree!1 (or N 250 to N 625 per ha of replanted rubber).



11  An    average tree would be approximately 30 feet high and have a diameter
       of 12 inches (30 x 3.1428 x 6 x 6) + 144 - 23.57.

       In the economic rate of return calculation, a conservative estimate for
       prices to be obtained from the sale of timbers has been used (N .40).
                                                             SUPPLEMENT 5
                                                             Appendix 10

3.        Since there will be a considerable volume of rubber timber avail
able, this would be sufficient to consider further and, possibly, more
profitable usea. The State would atimulate the exploration of alternative
usage of timber.

4.         There are four more possible uses:

     a.    as charcoal

     b.  as hardwood
     c.  as particle board
     d.    for pulping.

Charcoal from Rubber Wood

5.        Sweatman 11 considered the possibility of establishing portable
kilns to produce charcoal from rubber logs. Charcoal can be made from any
woody part of a tree. Its calorific value is higher than that of firewood
and it can be used, in addition to domestic heating, for industrial pur
poses, e.g., for an iron and steel works which are to be built in Nigeria
under the Third National Development Plan.

6.        The traditional earth pit kilns produce charcoal of low quality
and have low and uncertain yields. Sweatman had recommended a rectangular
kiln to take large wood sizes. The kiln would be 10 x 8 x 6 feet in size
with a capacity of 480 cubic feet and would be fitted with pipes to provide
the air for burning and stacks for the escape of smoke and steam. The
estimated cost in 1973 was N 960. The burning time would be about two days
and 15 burns per month had been assumed. A yield of 35% was used and a kiln
life of five years.
7.        The table below quotes Sweatman's cost analysis for a rectangular
kiln managed by a village operator on a loan basis.
8.        It was assumed in the calculations that the wood would be obtained
as sawmill waste and the price of N 6.00 for a load of 240 cu ft could,
therefore, be expected to be nominal. It is, however, a better price than
the figure of 40 kobo postulated for a tree of 20 cu ft (N 4.80 per load of
240 cu ft) and much better than the price of N 1.30 paid by one estate for
each stack of 6 x 6 x 3 (108 cu ft). Furthermore, the smallholder would be
able to sell much of the smaller timber, which would not be acceptable as
firewood.

9.        Rubber wood is being used for the production of charcoal on a
large scale in Sumatra, Indonesia, about 10,000 tons per annum being ex
ported. The product is blocky, not flaky, hard and handles well. Some
operators protect their charcoal after manufacture by making it into
small bricks and this may be justified if there is a demand.

10.       In conclusion, the smallholder could enhance his income consider
ably if he sold his rubber timber for charcoal and should, in view of the
profits postulated, be able to negotiate a better price than H 6.00 per
load of 240 cu ft.

Rubber as a Hardwood

11.        A disadvantage of rubber as a medium density hardwood, except when
used as cheap shuttering for building purposes, is its proneness to attacks
by woad-boring insects; but this can be overcome by treating it chemically
with boron salts before seasoning. In Sri Lanka the Industrial Development
Board (1971) proposed that treated planking from rubber timber be used for
the manufacture of cheap furniture, such as schoOl desks and chairs, and
for the interior parts of buildings. Boron-treated rubber wood holds nails
well and nail joints in rubber wood are less likely to come loose than in
either cypress or mahogany. Rubber wood shrinks very little and splitting
is overcome if the seasoning period is adequate, three weeks being quoted
as the minimum period.

12.       The average plantation due for replanting at 25 years or more
would yield about 19 cu ft per tree from the main trunk and 24 cu ft from
the main branches, i.e., 6,250 cu ft per hectare. Of this, it was reckoned
that there would be 1,250 cu ft/utilizable timber per hectare. Smallholdings
in Mid-Western State are more densely planted and would, therefore, yield a
greater amount of timber but not all of this would be suitable for sawing
into planks; 2,000 cu ft/ha might be a conservative estimate of timber util
izable for planking.

13.       It was estimated that a radius of 60 miles was the maximum econo
mic limit for supply as the logs had to be sawn into planks within 60 hours
of felling and treated with boron whilst the timber was still green. The
planks would be treated in a bath with boron at a concentration of 25 to 45%
and then covered with polythene or canvas for three to six weeks, these var
iables depending on the thickness of the planks; they would then be uncov
ered and res tacked for seasoning.

14.       The estimated costs in 1971 of the investment for a plant pro
ducing 70,000 cu ft of treated planking per annum were as follows:

Particle Board

17.       Rubber has never been investigated in Nigeria for particle board
manufacture since it has not hitherto been available. African Timber and
Plywood Products (ATMP) at Sapele has a pilot plant for the manufacture of
chipboard and block board. The future market for block board is not as
promising as for chipboard which is a cheaper product. Chipboard is made
at Sapele from sawmill waste and, therefore, costs the company very little
                                                            SUPPLEMENT 5
                                                            Appendix 10
                                                            Page 7

in raw materials. However, the sawmill handles over 30 species of timber 

and the chipboard is not homogeneous and there are problems with the glue 

bond. If there is to be a sizeable quantity of rubber timber available 

over a significant period, ATMP might be interested and would be prepared 

to examine samples for use as chipboard and for other possible uses. 


18.       The Tropical Products Institute, London, has recently (1973)
examined rubber wood from Liberia for particle board manufacture. 1/ It
was found that the extractives in the raw material interfered with-the
glue bond with a resulting loss of strength and water resistance. This
can be overcome to produce a board which meets the relevant British stand
ard specification, if the moisture content of the board mat is carefully
controlled, a high proportion of wax is incorporated and the surfaces of
the board mat are sprayed with water before pressing. Rubber wood cannot
be considered as a first choice of raw material for particle board manu
facture but its shortcomings might be reduced by admixture with another
more promising raw material.

19.       The development of a chip mill for particle board manufacture has 

possibilities which should be explored further. 


20.       In Malaysia contractors will pay the owner of rubber trees to fell 

them, including destumping, and to clear the timber for ship mills. This 

principle could be followed in Nigeria thus saving the owner the onus of 

disposing of his timber. 


Pal!er and Pull!

21.       In 1971, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization
(UNIDO) held a conference in Vienna on the development of pulp and paper
industries in developing countries. It was then noted that rubber wood
had not yet been accepted generally for newsprint manufacture. Experi
ments in India in 1969 on the use of rubber wood pulp for paper manufacture
had not been successful, but there is a promising pilot plant in Indonesia
which produces paper suitable for duplicating machines.

22.       Japan is practically the only user of rubber pulp on a commercial
scale, most of it being obtained from Malaysia. The rubber wood is converted
to chemical pulp for both paper and rayon. The Hohuetso paper mills recently
(1912) examined seedling rubber from the Amazon and compared it with Japanese
beech. The rubber wood was classified as a medium-density hardwood and gave
slightly lower pulp yield than Japanese beech. Fibre length was longer. It
could be pulped conventionally by both the sulphate and sulphite processes.
The three-stage bleached pulp was equivalent to that from Japanese beech.
The UNIDO conference noted that the pulp could be used for those papers

                                                            Appendix 10

for which chemical hardwood pulps are ordinarily used, i.e., writing, print
ing and duplicating papers, coating base papera and as a corrugating medium,
but the main problem was the inclusion of rubber particles (about 0.3%) in
the pulp which made the pulp unsuitable for certain paper grades. These
are derived from hardened latex embedded in wood of the former tapping
panels and from latex spilled on the wood at the time of debarking. The
bark is ususlly removed manually immediately sfter felling; the latex is
then still fluid and contaminates the wood. If the felled trees are left
for some montha, the latex then hardens; the latex is also less of a prob
lem if the trees are slaughter-tapped before felling, but in these cases
it is then difficult to remove the bark. There is also the possibility of
chemical debarking but this has to be investigated further. The Japanese
have been rather secretive about technical developments in rubber wood
pulping, particularly with respect to the latex problem. Hitherto it has
been considered not practical to incorporate more than 20 to 30% of rubber
wood pulp in paper or more than 20% in dissolving pulp for rayon, but Saito
(1972) has reported a process for the removal of rubbery impurities from
paper stock which is claimed to produce usable pulp from rubber trees.

23.       To warrant the establishment of a highly capitalized enterprise
based on the use of rubber wood exclusively, there. must be an irrevocable
arrangement which would secure an adequate, steady and continuous supply
of rubber wood. Irregular felling and diversification into the production
of other crops could endanger the enterprise. However, there is already
a pulping and paper mill at Jebba which is reportedly experiencing diffi
culty in obtaining supplies of raw material and a proportion of rubber wood
might be acceptable.

Other Possible Uses

24.        In 1959 the Forestry Department of Sri Lanka reported satisfactory
results from early trials with rubber wood for the manufacturing of tea
chests.
25.       In Malaya and Sri Lanka the use of rubber wood for the production
of hardboard has been investigated experimentally. A satisfactory pale col
oured standard hardboard was produced but the importance of efficient de
barking was stressed so that the latex did not interfere with manufacture.

Conclusions
26.       The most promising alternative use to firewood for rubber wood
would appear to be the manufacture of charcoal.

27.       The manufacture of chipboard could follow if investigations by
ATMP, the Forestry Research Institute and the Forestry Department of the
University of Ibadan are promising. The production of hardboard or fibre
board might then follow.

28.       Nigeria's developing paper industry may be interested in rubber
wood if the supply is a continuing one and the requirements of the other
enterprises above do not compete.

                       Area Under Intercropping


1·        The areas replanted with rubber would be intercropped during two
years (year 0 and year 1). The following three alternative intercropping
syst_ would be possible.

2.        Based on an assessment of the areas involved, the following assump
tiona have been made with regard to farmer response towards the three inter
cropping systeD18 proposed.

                              Systell                      Percentage

                                  a                           50%

3.        Since most farmers will intercrop with two crops during a year,
the percentage of the areas replanted uDder different intercrops is as
follows:

                              Year 0                       Year 1 


    Maize                         50%                        75%

4.        Based on the planting program and the assumptions above, areas
under different intercrops over the years are as follows:
Year        Rubber        Maize        Cowpeas        !!£!.        Yams
            ----------------------------Ha---------------------------

1978        3,000         3,000         4,250        1,250           750
1979        4,000         4,250         6,000        1,750         1,000
1980        5,000         5,500         7,750        2,250         1,250
1981        6,000         6,750         9,500        2,750         1,500
1982                      4,500         6,000        1,500
5.        It should, however, be remembered that cowpeas are harvested in
January following the year of planting. Although practically all costs would
have been incurred in Year 0, benefits would not be realized in that year but
in Year 1. For costing purposes it has therefore been assumed that all costs
will be incurred in the year of planting the cowpeas, but that production and
benefits will be realized in the year after planting.
6.        Therefore based on the above assumptions and the planting program,
the areas under different intercrop at the time of harvest over the different
years are as follows:

Year        Rubber        Maize        Cowpeas        Rice         Yams

1977        2,000         1,000                        500          500
            3,000         3,000                      1,250           750
            4,000         4,250                      1,750        1,000

            5,000         5,500                      2,250        1,250

            6,000         6,750                      2,750         1,500

                          4,500                      1,500

Background

1.        Under the rubber replanting schemes in the late 1960s/early
1970s smallholders were given grant cash payments of H 60 per acre (H 150
per hal in addition to inputs which were provided at subsidized prices, as
incentive to replant rubber. Under the subsequent replanting scheme the Mid
Western State Government replants the holding for the smallholder at no
cost to him. After two years the replanted area is turned over to the
smallholder for further maintenance. Both replanting schemes contain grant
elements estimated at 49% and 76% respectively of present rubber replanting
costs as follows:

2.        A large portion of the rubber in the Mid-Western State is old, has
been poorly maintained and is low yielding. If Nigeria is to continue to
produce rubber in any significant quantity the bulk of the existing small
holdings will have to be replanted with high yielding clones and maintained
at much higher standards. Poor yields and prices have tended to result in
the "slaughter" tapping (consuming much more bark annually than prudent) or
abandoning of holdings. Based on present estimated yields of about 300 lb/
acre and a price of about 4 kobo per lb/lump (say 50% drc) smallholder in
come from 1 ha of rubber would be N 60. Assuming that to obtain this income
he bas to work at least 125 tapping days (in fact he probably works more
days) his return per manday can be estimated at about NO.50 per manday for
less than the rural wage rate of NO.70. Under these conditions smallholders
have been unable to accumulate sufficient savings to replant their holdings.
The Mid-Western State Government's past and present replanting schemes reflect
its concern over a further decline in rubber production. Under its last
replanting scheme Government has replanted only 243 ha out of a planned
2,000 ha. Even though the Government replanted the holding for the smallholder,
holdings have subsequently not been maintained, reportedly because smallholders
had no incentive (no payments made to them after the holdings were returned)
to provide or hire labor for maintenance. The project would replant 20,000
ha over a five-year period. Replanting involves planting higher yielding
material, and maintaining good husbandry practices for a period of about six
years prior to the holding coming into production. The smallholder receives
no income during this period other than that from intercropping (which would
be required under the project) and the possible sale of timber (the felled
rubber trees) in the first few years. In order to obtain a positive response
to the replanting scheme under the project it is essential that smallholders
are provided with adequate compensation for their management and labor; it is
proposed that this is provided in the form of a grant/credit package.

Establishment costs of Rubber

3.        Estimated total costs of clearing, felling, planting and fer
tilizers (at full cost) and maintaining of a rubber holding are as follows:

Intercropping and Sale of Timber

4.        Before the replanting of rubber, the old trees would be felled
and cut. This would be done by contractors under the supervision of TCU.
The smallholder would heap the timber at the side of his holding. TCU
would also make arrangements for the sale of timbers. One ha of old rubber
would have an estimated 625 trees. Based on prices for firewood which range
between N 0.40 to N 1.00, revenue from the sale of firewood would, at the
lower estimate, amount to N 250/ha. 1/ A smallholder replanting rubber under
the project would also be required to intercrop his holding during two years
(Year 0 and Year 1). Possible intercrops are: (i) maize and cowpeas; (ii)
rice and cowpeas; and (iii) yams, maize and cowpeas (details are in Supple
ment 5). Additional income would therefore accrue to the smallholder from
intercropping!/. The income situation 1/ of a smallholder replanting rubber

        This is dependent on the study ofaltent~tive_u~g~ of timber; if the
        smallholder uses his own timber he will not receive actual income.
        The proposed grant/credit package assumes this although it can be
        altered later. For details see Attachment.
y       Although the revenue situation with different intercrops is not identi
        cal, differences are not extreme. Intercropping maize and cowpeas has
        been taken as an example in the tables.
        Cowpeas are planted in September and harvested in January. This has
        been reflected by costing this intercrop in one year (say Year 1 for
        example) and accruing benefits in the following year (thus Year 2).
                                                                   SUPPLEMENT 6

Grant/Credit Package for Establishment of Rubber
5.        The grant/credit package proposed takes into account the Mid-
Western State Government's wish to continue to provide grants and credits
to smallholders for replanting rubber, Nigeria's policy to provide inputs
throughout the agricultural sector at subsidized prices 1/, and the revenues
accruing to farmers from the sale of intercrops. 2/     

6.        For the replanting of his rubber the smallholder would receive
the necessary means--both cash (for hiring labor) and materials--during the
establishment period (Year -1 to 5). TCU would organize the felling of his

1/  Nigeria provides fertilizers and chemicals at subsidized prices.      Sub
        sidies are currently estimated at 75% of total costs and would account
        for about 60% of the proposed grant.
JJ     The grant/credit package would be adapted i f the sale of timber can
       be realized; see attachment.

old rubber trees by contractors and advise, the smallholder about the dis
posal of timbers. In addition the smallholder would also be provided with
the necessary inputs (seed and fertilizer) for intercropping and short
term credit would be available to cover this. The total grant/credit
package for replanting of rubber would therefore consist of the following
elements:

      (a)   felling and cutting of trees,

      (b)   materials (seed and fertilizer) for intercropping,

      (c)   materials and cash (for hiring labor) for the
            establishment of rubber.

7.        Felling and cutting of old rubber trees would be done by con
tractors in Year -1. TCU would organize this; the costs of cutting and
felling would be a medium-term credit. Materials for intercropping will
be provided by TCU in Year 0 and Year 1, and the costs of these would be
treated as a short-term credit. 1/ Materials and cash (for hiring of labor)
would be provided by TCU during Year -1 to Year 5 for establishment and
maintenance of rubber. For reasons of accounting simplicity and of present
ation to the smallholder it is proposed to treat the provision of materials
for replanting as a grant, and the cash assistance as a medium-term credit.




!I    In accordance with Nigeria's subsidy policy short-term credit would
      cover the full costs of the seeds, but only the subsidized costs of
      fertilizers. The State Government would reimburse TCU the differen
      tial between full costs and subsidized price of fertilizers.

remainder would be provided by the smallholder in the form of labor required
to heap the timber at the side of his holding.

The grant element of the proposed grant/credit package is about equivalent
to the old replanting scheme but less than the present replanting scheme
(see para 1). But under the project replanting would be much more effi
cient and benefits to smallholders would be greater than under the old
schemes.

9.        Short-term credit would be repaid to TCU, but medium-term credit
would be repaid through cooperatives. Arrangements for credit collection
are discussed below (see para 15).

Benefits to Smallholders

10.       The annual phasing of the cash payments is intended both to
reflect the costs of the labor required and also to provide an incentive
to the smallholder. This bas been done by reducing cash payments for labor
below the wage rate during the years when the smallholder receives income
and by increasing cash payments for labor above the wage rate during the
other years. The actual arithmetic is shown below:

During Year -1 the smallholder would receive short-' and medium-term credits
amounting to N 184.1 per ha (value of contract N 168 and cash payments for
labor N 16.1).  As shown above revenues of intercropping are sufficiently
large to allow the smallholder to repay short-term credit for the inputs for
int~rcropping.  The smallholder would not receive any income during Years 3,
4 and 5 and would be wholly dependent on the cash payments under the grantl
credit package. These payments are equal to labor costs except for labor
required for heaping of timbers (or total labor costs N 212.8 less labor for
heaping N 42.0 gives total cash payments of N 170.8). However, payments have
been phased in such a way (see para 10 for actual figures) as to be lower
than actual costs during the years that other revenue accrues to the small
holder, and higher than actual costs in other years. Thus the smallholder
will get a return per manday higher than the rural wage rate during the last
                                                       SUPPLEMENT 6

three immature years, and this will provide the necessary incentives. The
average return per man-day during the establishment period (N 1.38) is more
than satisfactory compared with the current rural wage rate of N 0.70.
Benefits during the mature period are detailed in the farm budgets.

Arrangements for Grant!Credit Distribution

11.       TCU would be responsible for channelling materials and cash to
the smallholders. To be eligible for project grant/credit assistance
smallholders should meet the requirements to participate in the replanting
scheme. TCU staff would appraise the applicants and their holding for tech
nical suitability and would assess their creditworthiness. Applications
would be reviewed and appraised by a Planting Authorization Committee (PAC)
composed of the General Manager of TCU as chairman, the Controller of Field
Operations, the Controller of Finance, and a representative of the coopera
tive division.

12.       Successful applicants would sign an agreement with TCU, set out
in accordance with Federal and State legal requirements and acceptable to
the Bank. The Loan Agreement would stipulate the amount, terms, conditions
and schedule of loan repayment and would include an undertaking by the
smallholder to deliver his latex to a Group Collection Center (GCC). Under
the project GCC's would be established for the initial processing of latex!
eoagulum. GCC's would be operated on a cooperative basis. The Loan Agree
ment would also include an undertaking by the smallholder to become a member
of the cooperative which operates "his" GCC within one year. The loan
agreement will require the smallholder to intercrop his holding, and the
smallholder will undertake to do this. The agreement will list the different
possible intercropping patterns but also definitely state which intercropping
pattern has been selected.Y At the time of delivery of inputs for inter
cropping the smallholder will sign a receipt showing the exact quantities of
inputs delivered and their costs. This receipt will serve as a basis for a
promissory note to be Signed by the smallholder. A credit folder for each
smallholder would be maintained which will contain a copy of the delivery
receipt, loan agreement and promissory note.

13.       The grant/credit assistance would be limited to a minimum of 1 ha
and a maximum of 6 ha per farm family. One ha is the smallest unit that is
considered practical to admin.1ster under the project, while 6 ha would re
quire three tappers and thus clearly needs a large farm family in order to
maintain its rubber and food crop holdings. Credit payments would be made
directly to smallholders at TCU headquarters or regional unit offices.
Delivery of materials for planting and maintaining of rubber and for inter
cropping would be made directly to smallholders by TCU vehicles. Materials
would be supplied when needed, but cash payments in all instances would be
subject to a field inspection report verifying that acceptable husbandry
standards had been attained. The procedures involved in grant/credit dis
tribution are summarized in Appendix 1.

1/  For larger holdings, however, the possibility to use more than one
     intercropping pattern is not excluded.
                                                         SUPPLEMENT 6
                                                         Page 10

14.       Credit facilities would be provided through TCU since an institu
tional framework for agricultural credit is not yet sufficiently established
in the project area. In addition, both the relatively small scale of the
credit operation in relation to TCU's other costs and its close relation
ship with TCU's technical supervision function make it desirable for credit
disbursement, accounting and recovery to be handled within TCU. The small
holders loan accounts would be integrated with accounts maintained for
bookkeeping purposes, for statistical research and for the purpose of eval
uating the progress of the project. Since additional cost of maintaining
the loan accounts would be relatively small, the cost of the staff and
equipment required would be borne by TCU (see Appendix 2).

Arrangements for Credit Collection

15.       As mentioned above the total grant/credit package contains the
following elements. These elements and terms and conditions for credit repay
ment are as follows:

      (a)  Felling and cutting of trees. This would be a medium

           term credit 1/ at 9%. Felling and cutting would be 

           done by contractors. The costs of this operation 

           would be charged by TCU to the smallholder loan 

           account. 


      (b)  Materials for intercropping would be provided by TCU. 

           This would be a short term 2/ credit at 9%. Repay 

           ments would be made by smallholders to TCU credit 

           officers and loan assistant who will visit the 

           villages at the time of harvesting. Any debt out 

           standing would be settled by reduction of cash 

           payments for rubber maintenance. 


      (c)  Materials and cash payments (for hiring labor) for 

           establishment and maintenance of rubber. Materials 

           would be provided as a grant and cash payments would 

           be provided as a medium term credit at 9%. 


16.       The total medium-term credit (N 338) would be for 17 years includ
ing 8 years of grace during which interest would be capitalized. Repayments
would be by deduction from the sale of rubber. Repayments would be made
through the cooperative societies which will guarantee the repayments of
the smallholders in return for which they will receive an interest spread of
2%. Smallholders will repay to their cooperative at 9% and cooperatives


!/    If the sale of timber proves feasible it would be a short-term credit,
      see Attachment.
£/  For calculation purposes, term assumed at 6 months for maize, rice and
      cowpeas, and at 9 months in case of yams.
                                                        SUPPLEMENT 6
                                                        Page 11

would repay to TCU at 7%. Indebtedness of the smallholder would thus reach
N 603.4/ha 1/ by the end of year 7 and equal monthly repayments during 9 years
by the smallholders to their cooperative would amount to N 8.20/ha £/ a month.

17.       The smallholder will undertake to become within one year a member
of a cooperative which at maturity will operate the Group Collection Center.
The Cooperative Division of the Ministry of Trade and Industries will es
tablish cooperatives within a year after approval of smallholder applications.
However, not all cooperatives. will be estab1ishe4 or functioning in such a
way as to serve as channels for repayments of short-term credit. Short-term
credit would therefore be repaid directly to TCU but medium-term credit
would be repaid through the cooperatives.

18.       The cooperative societies which will operate the GCC's will be
used as a medium for medium-term credit collection for the following reasons:

     <a)   they would have direct control of smallholder's proceeds
           of rubber sales and could thus easily deduct the monthly
           loan repayments; and

     (b)   they would provide a mutual guarantee of loan repayment,
           since it is not feasible to rely on distraint of land
           or property for loan recovery.

19.       The cooperatives would be given a direct interest in representing
smallholder's interests on the TCU's Steering Committee, the Planting Author
ization Committee and on the Rubber Price Policy Committee, all of which
would include a representative of the State cooperative movement. Involve
ment in the project would act as an important stimulus to the further devel
opment of community/cooperative group activities in the Mid-Western State
smallholder agriculture. In recognition of their loan repayment guarantees,
the cooperatives would receive an interest spread of 2%. This should benefit
them financially provided that their members maintain a satisfactory repay
ment rate. Details are in Appendix 3.

20.       Coagulum collected by MRDA would be initially weighted at GCC and
a receipt is issued for the total weight. When the coagulum collected from
several GCC's is delivered to the factory, it would be weighed and recorded
and the duplicate of the receipt issued to each GCC would be handed over to
the factory. Thus the factory will now know each GCC's share in the produce
delivered and will credit each cooperatives' accounts accordingly. The
factory will close its accounts weekly and send checks to each cooperative
(through MRDA lorry drivers). The cooperatives would deduct from the pro
ceeds of rubber sales each smallholders loan repayments at 9% and would

1/  At 9%, indebtedness of cooperative <at 7%) would be N 531.54/ha.
£/  At 9%, equal monthly payments of the cooperative to TCU <at 7%)
     would be N 6.70/ha.
                                                       SUPPLEMENT 6
                                                       Page 12

remit the balance to him. It would repay TCU at 7% and retain the in
terest spread. For statistical and control purposes the factories would
provide TCU with summaries of rubber purchases analyzed by cooperative
society. The cooperative would also submit summaries of rubber sales and
repayments of its members. Summaries would be prepared monthly.

21.       Smallholder repayments (by deduction) to the cooperative at 9%
would amount to N 8.20/ha monthly over nine years. The cooperative would
repay at 7% to TCU amounting to N 6.70/ha monthly.

22.       The procedures involved in credit repayments are summarized in
Appendix 4.

Other Credit

23.       Short-term credit could also be made available for non-labor
maintenance inputs--particularly tapping utensils--during the mature
stage. This is not part of the project grant/credit package but TCU
could provide the inputs and instead of charging each smallholder sepa
rately it would charge the cooperative for the total requirements of its
members. This credit would have an identical interest rate as the other
credit and be amortized over a period compatible with the expected rev
enues and debt servicing of the smallholder. The smallholder would repay
its cooperative, which would repay to TCU. This arrangement would relieve
TCU with the administrative burden of maintaining numerous accounts in its
books.

24.       The introduction of credit in the proposed project would estab
lish an institutional framework for credit which eventually could be used
to provide participating smallholders with their short term credit needs,
using rubber sales as collateral. Once smallholders have established their
rubber, TCU would aim to hand over the provision of other credit to the
cooperatives themselves as soon as practicable.

                Procedures for Grant/Credit Distribution


 1.        TCU, together with representatives of the Cooperative Division
 and, if necessary, the Ministry of Lands and Housing (land tenure problems)
 would discuss with village elders the proposed planting scheme. Assurances
 of their cOGperation would be obtained. This would include an assurance
 that land occupational rights of approved participants would not be dis
 turbed.                                        .

 2.        TCU would post notices on the replanting scheme (zonal approach)
 which would provide a brief description of procedures prospective appli
 cants would follow (application form to be provided by TCU).

 3.        The smallholder would demarcate his holding and submit an applica
 tion to participate in the'scheme.

  4.        Upon receipt of the application TCU staff would inspect the small
  holder's (s') holdings and pay particular attention to soil suitability,
  water table, accessibility, occupational rights, boundary (verification of
. demarcation to be done at the time of inspection) third party claims and
  smallholders' creditworthiness. This would be done between April and July.
  It is necessary that some form of control on application received and
  actions taken thereon be maintained by TCU. Also, field staff would apply
  a checklist of all requirements necessary for approval of an application.

 5.        TCU staff would immediately submit a report on the results of the
 inspection (Pro forma report to be prepared by TCU).

 6.        PAC evaluates report of TCU staff and approves or disapproves 

 application. 


 7.         Smallholder would be notified of approval or rejection of appli
 cation.   In case of rejection the reasons will be given to the smallholder.

 8.        Smallholders whose applications have been approved would sign
 an agreement with TCU. The agreement would include an undertaking by the
 smallholder to intercrop his holding, process and market his latex through
 a Group Collection Center and to become a member of the cooperative which
 operates this center.

9.        Cooperative Division staff would organize or reorganize coopera
tives in the zones where applications bave been approved. The aim would
be to establish cooperatives within one year of 6.
10.       TCU would prepare tenders for the felling and cutting of old'
rubber trees and prepare specifications and tt.etables for the contractors.
TCU would arrange with the smallholder as to the exact dates for the felling
of old rubber trees.
11.       Smallbolder would clear and stack timber and make holding ready
for rubber planting and intercropping under the supervision of TOO staff
in accordance with planting techniques laid down.

12.        Teo   would advise about the disposal of timbers.
13.       TCU staff would continue supervision and suhit annual reports to
PAC. Report would contain rec01llllendation whether cash payments be made to
smallholder or not.
14.       PAC would review tbe report and authorize casb payments to small
bolder.   If payments are withbeld the reasons aust be given to the . .11
holder.

15.       TCU would maintain appropriate accounting records for each small
holder on disbursements made for grant and credit.
16.       TCU would continue to provide the smallholder with guidelines
about planting and maintenance techniques. Preferably a smallholder hand
book would be developed.
17.       When cooperatives are organized, TCU would provide them with
duplicate records of the credit provided for rubber establishment to each
amallbolder-member. TCU would charge each cooperative for the total loans
of its members, and maintain appropriate accounting records for amounts due
from each cooperative and remittances made by it.

1.        The grant/credit disbursements would require TCU to maintain appro
priate accounting records for individual smallholders analyzed by regional
units. A separate account would be maintained for each ..allholder to record
the following:
     (a)  disbursements for the grant components which should 

          show the quantity and costs of budded stu.ps, cover 

          crop seeds, tree poison, fertilizer, cheaicals and 

          tools, delivered to the smallholder; 

     (b)  disbursements for the value of the contract of 

          felling of trees, which will be paid to the 

          contractor; 

     (c)  disbursements for seeds and fertilizer requirements 

          (quantity and costs) for intercropping; 

     (d)  disbursements of cash payaants for labor;
     (e)  repay.ents for the value of the contract if repaid as 

          short-term credit!1 (see (b»; and 

     (f)  repay.ents for intercropping if inputs were provided 

          as seasonal credit (see (c». 

 2.        When the cooperatives are organized, TCU would provide each coop
 erative with the data of the loan account of each of its .eabers covering 

 disbursements of cash pay.ents for labor (1 (d» and the costs of felling 

(1  (b». In addition, TCU, based on these data, would co~ute the aonthly
 repay.ents that smallholders bave to pay to their cooperative and the
 .onthly repay.ents due to TCU fra. the cooperative and provide these figures
 to each cooperative. After field establisbaent coapletion, Teo would not
 maintain accounts for each smallholder, but would coabine all 8IIa1lholder
 accounts of one cooperative into one cooperative account.

11  This is only feasible after the study on disposal of timers has been
     coapleted; as proposed the .edium-term credit would be capitalized.

                                                            Page 2

3.        TCU would maintain separate accounts with each cooperative to
record the following basic information:

     (a)   the mount due from each cooperative (H 6.70 per
           month/ha x 108 x the hectares planted by its small
           holder members) !!;
     (b)   actual monthly repayments of each cooperative which
           would be net of the 2% interest spread allowed for
           guaranteeing the collection of loans;
     (c)   the cost of tapping materials (only if Teu provided
           these materials to the cooperative) and the repay
           ments due for this delivery;
     (d)   repayments received for tapping . .terials (if
           provided by TCU to cooperative on credit);

     (e)   investment costs in the Gee building and equipment
           which were built by Teu for the cooperative and
           repayments due (based on an annual depreciation
           charge over 10 years); and

     (f)   repayments received for   Gee   building and equipment
           costs.

4.         During the establishment period, Teu would have to aaintain small
holder accounts, each requiring a maximum of 2 entries per month. Since
the recording requirements are too nU1llerous to be done . .nually, prOVision
WDuld be 1Ilade for mechanical recording on individual cards using simple
accounting machines each capable of registering about 10,000 entries per
month. These . .chines can be operated by a specially trained typist. The
number of smallholder accounts and machines needed are given below:




!!  Since Teu  would not maintain separate accounts with each smallholder,
     after the establishment period, it would not continue using the small
     holder's individual loan record for repayment purposes. However, in
     dividual records would be useful for reference purposes and as support
     for the loan account with each cooperative.

                      Financial Effect on Cooperatives

1.        The proposed credits to smallholder totalling. 338.0 per hectare
(not including credit for intercropping) would be repaid by smallholders to
their cooperative at N 8.20 per hectare oyer 108 months, based on an interest
rate of 9%. Repayments would start in year 8. The cooperatives are charged
interest at a rate of only 1%, in recognition of their guarantee of loan
repayaents by their members and their monthly obligation to TCU in respect
of members' planted area under the scheme ..aunts to only N 6.10 per hectare
per aonth. Thus with no default on members' repayments to the cooperatives,
the societies would gain a margin of · 1.50 per month/ha or · 18.0 per year/ba
OYer a 9-year repayment period.
2.        This margin is, in fact, sufficient to coyer current repayment
obligations to TCU with a rate of default or arrears of up to 18.3% of
members' repayments to their cooperative. The net margin (loss) per
hectare to cooperatives at different rates of default/arrears is shown

    L!    The net margin for any intervening or higher rate of
          default can be calculated as follows: Y - 18.0 - 98.4 X;
           Y -      Net margin (loss)

                      (N 18.00)
         98.4 -     Annual repayments by smallholder to cooperative
                      (N 98.4) 

          x     -   Percentage default.

Thus, provided that members' early repayments performance was reasonably
satisfactory (default of not more than, say, 5%) the cooperatives would
fairly soon accumulate surpluses to their account sufficient to tide them
over any temporary decline in members' rubber sales to the factories, due
for instance to sea80na1variations in yields, and allow thea to maintain
full payment of their obligations to the TCU.

3.        Based on the smallholder Pfanting prograa, Table 1 summarizes the
annual and cumulative effect of the credit margins accruing to cooperatives
on assumed default rates of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25% (18.3% default marks
break-even point for cooperatives).

4.        Table 1 shows that, even with default on smallholder repayments
of 5%, the cooperatives should accumulate sizeable cash surpluses as a
consequence of the margin allowed to them. By the time annual repayments
reached their peak (project Year 12), they would be in a position to have
accumulated a cash reserve approximately equal to four and a half months'
repayments due TCU. With satisfactory repayment performance by smallholders,
surpluses over and above a prudent level of reserves would be available for
financing of seasoua1 credit requirements.

1.        TOO would deliver materials for intercropping (seeds and fertil
izers) to the aaallhoider.
2.        s.allholder would sign a receipt which would indicate quantity
of materials delivered, and their costs. '!'be receipt would serve as basis
for a promissory note to be signed by the smallholder.
3.        At tiae of harvesting credit officers and loan assistants of TCU's
Regional units would visit the villages in accordance with a predeterained
timetable to collect the repayaents. They would be ..pressly designated by
TCU as authorized officers to collect the loans at predesignated zones and
smallholders would be inforaed of this arrang_ent.
4.        When repaying, the smallholder would receive a receipt indicating
amount repaid for principal and for interest. If payment is made in full,
the oriainal proaissory note would be cancelled and returned to the small
holder.
5.         Second visits to villages would be made for any repayments not yet
collected.
6.        After second visits, all repa)'lllf!nts due are collected by reducing
with the appropriate amount the cash payments due to the smallholder for
rubber maintenance.
Medina-tera credit for costs of tree fellins and cash payments for labor
7.          Smallholder would be a .ember of a registered cooperative which
operates   Gec.
8.          Smallholder would tap trees and bring latex to GeC.
9.        GeC would weigh and check. latex. A weigh slip receipt would be
issued to the smallholder and a copy retained by GeC to support its records
for smallholders.

10.         Gee would process (primary processing) latex into coagulum.

11.       MRDA would collect the coagulum at Gee daily. (Sample would be 

sent to RRIN to determine drc.) Weigh slip receipt would be distributed 

as follows: 


      (a)   Gee (original)
      (b)   Factory (duplicate)
      (c)   MRDA (triplicate)
12.       After making the rounds to assigned Gees the trucks would pro
ceed to the factory. The load of coagulum wuld be weighed and drc aeas
ured. The weigh slip receipt wuld be distributed as follows:
      <a)   MRDA (original)
      (b)   Factory (duplicate)

13.       On the basis of information from the receipts the factory would
credit the account of each cooperative.
14.       Every Thursday the factory would close its accounts with each
cooperative and send checks <through MRDA lorry drivers) corresponding to
the value of coagulum delivered the preceding week (the factory would also
pay a margin to MRDA for transportation and operating cost).
15.       Gee would close its accounts on the same day (Thursday) and
calculate each smallholder's share. Smallholders would be paid every
Saturday at the office of the cooperative. Since the cooperative remits
the loan repayments monthly to TCU it should evolve a system of deduction
from smallholder's weekly share (say H 2.0S a week).
16.       At the end of each month the cooperative would issue a check to
TCU covering the 1IlOnthly repayments of its members net of the 2% margin 1/
(TCUts controller of finance wuld be responsible for advising cooperatives
on the framework of calculations to be used and on each smallholder liabil
ity for repayment). The remittance should be supported by a summary of
rubber sales shOwing each member's sales for the month and his loan repay
ments to the cooperative.
17.       The factories would provide Teu with summaries of rubber purchases
analyzed by cooperatives (at least monthly).

!I  Preferably   an automatic arrangement if possible. such as an automatic
      monthly payment by the cooperatives' bank to TCU's account.

8tudy will be undertaken to deteraine alternative U8age of felled rubber
tree8, in which ca8e the trees will be sold after felling thus enabling the
smallholder to pay for the c08ts of felling t..ediately. The credit term8
would then change and the relevant figure8 and change8 compared with the
Suppleaent are 8ummarized below.

3.           Before the replanting of rubber. the old trees would be felled
and cut.     This would be done by contractors under the 8upervision of TCU.
                                                                  SUPPLEMENT 6

The smallholder would heap the timber at the side of his holding and the
timber would be sold. One ha of old rubber would have an estimated 625
trees. Based on prices for firewood which range between N 0.40 to N 1.00,
revenue from the sale of firewood would, at the lower estimate, amount to
N 250/ha. A smallholder replanting rubber under the project would also be
required to intercrop his holding during two years and additional income
would therefore accrue to the smallholder from inteTcropping. The income
situation of a smallholder replanting rubber without a grant/credit package
can be summarized (more details are in the farm budgets) as follows:

4.            The total grant/credit package for replanting of rubber would
ti.u~refore   consist of the following elements:

         (a)  felling and cutting of trees,

         (b)  materials (seed and fertilizer) for intercropping,

         (c)  materials and cash (for hiring labor) for the
              establishment of rubber.

5.        It is proposed to treat the costs of cutting and felling as a
short-term credit since the smallholder would be able to repay against the
revenue received from the sale of tfllber. Materials for intercropping will
be provided by TCU in Year 0 and Year 1, and the costs of these would be
treated as a short-term credit. 1/ Materials and cash (for hiring of labor)
would be provided by TCU during Year -1 to Year 5 tor establishment and
maintenance of rubber. For reasons of accounting simplicity and of present
ation to the smallholder it is proposed to treat the prOVision of materials
for replanting as a grant, and the cash assistance as a mediUll-term credit.

72      Repayment of value of contract (K 168) with one year interest.

During Year -1 the smallholder would receive short- and medium-term credits
~~unting to N 184.1 per ha (value of contract N 168 and cash payments for
labor N 16.1). As shown above revenues in Year 0 from the sale of inter
crops and timber are sufficiently large to allow the smallholder to repay
the credit for the value of the contract, and revenues of intercropping are
sufficiently large to allow the smallholder to repay short-term credit for
the inputs for intercropping. The smallholder would not receive any in
come during Years 3, 4 and 5 and would be wholly dependent on the cash
payments under the grant/credit package.

8.        Arrangements for Credit Collection as mentioned above the total
grant/credit package contains three main elements. These elements and
terms and conditions for credit repayment are as follows:
      <a)   Felling and cutting of trees. This would be a short.
            term credit !I at 9%. Felling and cutting would be
            done by contractors. The costs of this operation
            would be charged by teD to ~he 8IIil1lholder loan
            account. Repayment would be within a year by deduc
            tion from the sale of tmbers. Part of the sales
            value of tmber would be paid to the smallholder at
            the time of collection and the remainder would be
            remitted to TCU. 21
      <b)   Materials for intercropping would be provided by TeU.
            This would be a short term credit at 9%. Repay
            ments would be made by smallholders to TeU credit
            officers and loan assistant wbowill Visit the
            villages at the t::bae of harvesting ·. Any debt out
            standing would be settled by reduction of cash
            payments for rubber maintenance.
      (c)   Materials and cash payments (for hiring labor) for
            establishment and maintenance of rubber. Materials
            would be provided as a grant and cash payments would
            be provided as a medium term credit at 9% for 17 years
            witb 8 years grace during which interest would be
            capitalized. Repayments would be by deduction from
            tbe sale of rubber. Repayments would be made through
            the cooperative societies which will guarantee the
            repayments of the smallholders in return for which
            they will receive an interest spread of 2%. Small
            holders will repay to their cooperative at 9% and
            cooperatives would repay to TCU at 7%. Indebtedness
            of the smallholder would thus reach H 268.65/ha 1
            by the end of year 7 and equal monthly repayments during
            9 years by the smallholders to their cooperative would
            amount to N 4.90/ha -' a month.
9.        Smallholder repayments (by deduction) to the cooperative at 9%
would amount to H 4.90/ha monthly over six years. The cooperative would
repay at 7% to TCU amounting to H 4.15/ha monthly.
!I  For   calculation purposes, term is assumed to be one year.
21    Based on a sales value of H 250/ba, the smallholder would receive
      H 66.9 and H 183.1 would be remitted to TCU (N 168 prinCipal and N 15.1
      interest at 9% for a one year period.

10.       Short-term credit felling and cutting.   These arrangements (see
also appendix 4) would be as follows:
     (a)  TeU would organize the felling and cutting of the 

          old rubber trees. 

     (b)  Smallholder would heap t~e ~t.ber at the side of the
         holding.                 y   ~                  ,




     (c)  TOO would make arrangements for the same of timber.
     (d)  Buyers of timber would pay part of the sales value of the
          timber to the smallholder at the time of collection and
          remit the remainder to TOO. !!
     (e)  TCU would credit smallholder loan account for the repay
          ments of principal and credit the interests to its internal
          revenue account.




!!  Based on a sales value of R 250 per hectare the smallholder would
    receive R 66.9 and TCU would receive R 183.1 CR 168.0 is repayment
    of principal and N 15.1 is interest at 9% for a period of a year).

General
1.        Technical training at all levels will comprise a very important
sector of project activity. The type of training involved can be divided
into six basic categories: Senior Staff, NUrsery Staff, Field Staff,
Smallholders, Tappers, and Budders.
Senior Staff
2.         Senior officers (Agricultural Officers and above) would be given
six months training in field planting techniques and management. These
officers 'WOuld be attached to large scale rubber development/replanting
schemes or commercial estates where apporpriate busbandry standards were
practiced. The scope for meeting these training requirements is currently
somewhat ltmited in Nigeria and staff will probably have to be sent either
to neighboring West African countries such as Liberia (Firestone's Estates)
or to Malaysia in the Far East. In certain instances officers might be
attached to institutions such as the Federal Land Development Authority or
the Rubber Industry Smallholders Development Authority of Malaysia where
they would get an opportunity to study modern planting techniques as well
as management systems geared to smallholder operations. The establishments
to which these officers are sent should be provided with quite detailed
outlines of the spheres of field and management practice that require emphasis.
On return these men 'WOuld be expected to submit a full report on their work
program giving details of an comments on the techniques and management systems
studied.
3.        The Mananga Agricultural Management College run by the Coqaonvealth
Development Corporation offers a 12~eek course in agricultural business
management and selected senior staff such as the Read of TCU Rubber Division
and Heads of the Regional Units could attend such a course prior to their
technical field training in Malaysia or Liberia.
Nursery Staff

4.        For each Regional Unit, one Senior Agricultural Superintendent (SAS)
and two Agricultural Assistants (AA's) would receive special training in
nursery techniques involving the use of brown budwood. Green budding is not
                                                        SUPPLEMENT 7
                                                        Page 2
recommended as there are insufficient experienced budders available in Nigeria.
In addition, two Agricultural Officers would be trained in the techniques and
organization of operating large-scale nurseries. Training nursery staff would
involve acquiring experience in all aspects of nursery work ranging from the
preparation of germination beds up to the pulling, waxing and bundling of 18
to 20 month budded stumps. The RRIN and the c01llllercial estates would be
able to provide the venue for training the !A's and SAS's over a period of
about 6 months in all - but segmented so as to cover the various essential
stages in nursery operations. In addition to technical training, the two
Agricultural Officers with overall responsibility for nurseries would
require exposure to the organization and control of large-scale nurseries
and this would probably involve a visit to a neighboring West African
country where large-scale programs of replanting/new planting are being
carried out.
Field Staff
5.        Training of AA's would comprise a l-month intensive course in modern
planting techniques followed by 2-3 months practical training in the super
vision of field operations on large commercial estates. While the course
would include the basic techniques of nursery cultivation, the emphasis would
be on the methods and control of field practices in replanting, maintenance
in imMature and mature planting, opening and tapping trees and the collection
and processing of latex. The intensive course of lectures and demonstrations
would be given at the RRIN and an outline of a syllabus given at Appendix 1.
The course would include visits to nearby estates to demonstrate the organi
zation and supervision of labor in selected field operations. All field
staff would also be trained in appraisal and grant/credit supervision pro
cedures. Short refresher courses for senior and field staff would be arranged
at the RRIN from time to time to ensure that all practices being used are
up-to-date. In particular it will be necessary for Agricultural Assistants
to be given short refresher courses in tapping, collection and initial
assembly/processing of latex just before their areas come into bearing. Tapp
ing and latex handling discipline is going to be a critical factor in the
early years of maturity and the importance of providing special training at
the right time for both field staff and smallholders cannot be over-emphasized.
Smallholder Training
6.         Training would concentrate on two main areas of activity namely:
     (a)   Replanting and maintenance practices.
     (b)   Tapping and latex collection.

7.        Replanting/Maintenance - training would essentially comprise de
monstration and discussions developed on a group activity basis, combined
with short intensive courses (see Appendix 2).
                                                         SUPPLP..MENT 7
                                                         Page 3
         The demonstrations/discussions would include:
          (i)  simple outlining of application procedures including
               the requirement to attend a short intensive course on
               replanting;
         (ii)  demonstrations of specific planting practices at selected
               smallholdings;
        (iii)  group disussions supported with visual aids and materials
               prior to, and in the course of, the planting prograa; and
         (iv)  short refresher course of 1 to 2 day duration at the
               Regional Unit training centers or the DIN.
8.        The objectives of the intensive course would be to provide
smallholders with:

          (i)  details of the replanting procedures and regulations
               including the loan agreement requirements;
         (ii)  basic techniques involved in replanting and intercropping
               practices outlined step by step; and
        (iii)  assessment of benefits accruing to good husbandry
               practices.
9.        Participation would be confined to potentially suitable applicants.
The courses would be conducted at simple training schools erected in 1976 at
the central nursery locations in the 4 Regional Units. Courses would last for
5 days. Smallholders would be provided with basic accommodation, food. and
an allowance of N 1.00 per day. Total costs including accomodation, food
and allowances are estimated at N 15 for each .allbolder to be trained.
Training of Tappers
10.       Although many smallholders and tappers have been trained by MANa
in the past, the general standard of tapping on smallholdings is poor. There
is virtually no control of panel diseases and the tappers frequently open cuts
on the trunks wherever they think they will get the highest immediate yield.
If the projected yields from trees planted under the project are to be
realized, a high standard of tapping must be maintained. It is tberefore
necessary to make it compulsory for tappers of rubber replanted under the
project to undergo tapping training. The courses will take place in eacb of
the four regions at simple training schools erected at the nursery sites.
11.       Tapping schools will require a certain area of aature rubber for
demonstrations and practising. For this purpose rubber will be planted
preferably in 1976 on land adjacent to the nurseries in each of the regions.
                                                       SUPPLEMENT 7
                                                       Page 4

Twenty hectares will be planted in the Ekiadolor project area and 10 hectares
in each of the other three project areas. The rubber will be planted in the
same way as for project replantings, using the same clones and the same
planting distance so that tappers will be trained under the same conditions
as on project smallholdings. In addition to the trees, boles of trees about
7 feet high will be placed in the ground to simulate actual trees. One bole
will be available for two tappers, each tapper practicing tapping on opposite
pannels, enabling the instructor to evaluate each tapper's skill. Boles of
trees will also be provided for refresher courses.

12.       Tapping will start on the first replantings in March of 1983.
Therefore tapping training courses must start in 1982. The period October!
December is considered the most suitable as rain interference will not be
serious and nor will there be a long period between training and actual
tapping. Refresher courses will be held just before tapping starts.

13.       Tapping courses will last for two periods of six days for each tapper,
and refresher courses for three days. Longer training would be preferable but
smallholders would find it difficult to be away from their holdings for periods
of more than one week.

14.       Tapping instructors will be trained for a period of four weeks at the
RRIN before the tapper training courses begin. Tbey will undergo a second
period of four weeks training at the RRIN the following year when newly
recruited instructors are undergoing their first period of training. The
instructors will be selected from those currently employed by MANR of whom
there are about fifty.

15.       Special laborers who will help the Agricultural Ass~stants and the
smallholders to open the rubber for tapping will also be trained. They ~l
spend two weeks on the courses and will also attend the refresher courses.
16.       An outline of tapper training course is given in Appendix 3. Details
of tapper training requirements and the number of tapping instructors needed
are given in Appendix 4. Cost of tapper training is in Table 1.

Training of Budders

17.       Budder Requirement. Some 66,000 buddings are made in each hectare
of budded stump nursery which provides suff~cient stumps for 76 hectares of
field planting. The period over which budding can be done is mid March to mid
May giving 52 working days. Each budder can bud 120 seedlings per day.
                                                          SUPPLEMENT 7
                                                          Page 5
18.           The requireaent for budders is therefore:

After 1977 about 140 extra budders are required eaeh year up to 1981. The
50 ha to be planted for the tapping training sehools, although listed under
1977 plantings, would preferably be establisbed in 1976. This would not
substantially reduee budder requirements. Budding neeessary for the field
establis_ent of training school rubber areas eould be done during the main
training eourse for budders in 1976.
19.       Assuming a 25% drop out, tbere would be a need to train 380 budders
for 1977 and 187 extra for eaeh year up to 1981. Budders would be basieally
reeruited frOll the nursery labor employed for preparation, planting, weeding
etc. whieb will have been in progress for 18 months before the budding opera
tion starts in 1977. At that time about 250 laborers would be eaployed, based
on around 3 laborers per heetare of nursery. Some extra labor will therefore
have to be recruited as budders.
20.         A _in eourse of two weeks duration will take plaee in Oetoberl
November and a refresher eourse in early Mareh before budding starts from
1I1d.-mareb to JRid-May. It is reeoaaended that eaeh budder will attend the
_in eourse and refresber eourse twiee. Total number of budders to be trained

21.       Assuming one bu,dding instructor can instroct 20 budders and that 3
courses each of 2 weeks duration are held over the period October to mid
November, 6 budding instructors will be required in 1976. To ensure an
adequate supply it is recommended. that 10 budding instructors should be
trained, 4 for the Benin area and 2 each for the other three areas. The
budding instructors would be recruited from MANR and RRIN, and be trained
at lUUN.

22.       The budding instructors would be required for the period October!
November and in March for instructing; these instructors would also be
required over the period of mid-March to mid-May for supervising the budding
of the seedling nursery.

Training Procedure

23.       Each course will last for two weeks with each refresher course in
March before budding commences lasting for one week. The approach used
WDuld basically comprise demonstrations followed by practice and essentially
would cover the following points:

     (a)  Outlining the main steps in budding, using slides and diagrams as
          well as budding mateJ;'ial and eqaipment;

     (b)  Opening stock flaps;

     (c)  Cutting and trimming bud patches;
     (d)  Stripping and final trimming of bud patches;

     (e)  Placing of budslips;

     (f)  Closing, binding and waxing;
     (g)  Subsequent identification of success by unwinding and 

          exa.mina t ion. 


24.       Of the 72,600 seedlings per hectare of seedling nurseries 5%
(3,600) are reserved for budder training. There are 27 hectares of budded
stump nursery to plant 2,050 hectares in the field in year 0, so that
97,200 seedlings are available for initial training and refresher training
before budding in 1977. This amount to 340 seedlings per trainee.

25.       Budwood of any clone will be suitable for use in training as long
as it is in good condition. The costs of budder training are given in
Table 2.

    Outline of a course in rubber replanting. tapping and processing
                               Techniques

          This course would be conducted at the KIlN and would aim at pro
viding field staff (SAS and AA level) with sound working knowledge of the
basic practices involved in replanting, tapping and processing rubber.

Method - the approach used being essentially:
     (a)   a lecture on a selected subject/practice, followed by
     (b)   a field demonstration and/or observation, followed by
     (c)   a discussion period.
          For specific practices such as tree poisoning, felling trees and
clearing land, lining and boling, intercropping, weeding, aanuring and
tapping, trainees would spend time in the field carrying out the various tasks
involved so as to be in a position to subsequently demonstrate the practices
to _llbolders.
Duration - about 4 months divided into two periods to coincide as far as
possible with the main seasons for' (a) land preparation and (b) planting.

                           Outline of Lectures

1.        Timing of Operations. An outline of the basic calendar of operations
involved when replanting rubber to include the establishment of nurseries,
land clearing, planting, intercropping, immature and mature maintenance, and
tapping. The importance of timing operations to fit the climate patterns of
the area. A bar chart showing work !teas, timing, duration and basic man-day
requirements is one of the most suitable ways of getting this subject across
to trainees (see Charts attached to Supplement 5).

2.    Planting Material

      (a)      Desirable characteristics for a rubber tree.
      (b)      Breeding and selection.
      (c)      Characteristics of selected clones and seedling planting material.
      (d)      Characteristics of recommended clones - emphasizing suitability
               for smallholder plantings.

3.    Propagation and Planting.

               Establishment of a Budwood MUltiplication Nursery.

      (a)  Site preparation
      (b)  Nursery spacing
      (c)  Holing (when using budded stumps)
      (d)  Planting
      (e)  Nursery maintenance
      (f)  Cutting and packing budwood.

               Forms of Budgrafttng Material

           Material for establishing budgrafted plantings may be distributed
      in forms ranging from budwood to budded plants in poly"ags~ and include:

      (a)  Brown budwood
      (b)  Green budsticks
      (c)  Budded stumps
      (d)  Green budded stumps
      (e)  Stumped buddings
      (f)  Green budded stumps in polybags
      (g)  Green budded plants in polybags.

           The advantages and disadvantages of these various forms should be
      discussed in relation to the smallholder replanting program.

               Establishment of a Nursery to supply budded stumps

           It is assumed that central nurseries would be located in each
      Region and t.hat brown budwood would be used. If greed budding is
      introduced~ then appropriate adjustments should be made to this
      sector of the course.

      (a)  Seed collection - timing and type
            
      (b)  Preparation of germination beds and sowing
            
      (c)  Preparation of nursery beds.
            
      (d)  Planting germinated seed
            
      (e)  Maintenance - weeding~ manuring~ pest & disease control
            
      (f)  Thining and rouging
            
      (g)  Budding - including opening and rebudding
            
      (h)  Cutting back
            
      (1)  Pulling, waxing and bundling.

                    Outline of Tapper Training Courses


1.        The basic theories of tapping, including spiralling of latex vessels.
Anatomy of the bark including position of the latex vessels and importance
of the cambium. Diagrams will be used as visual aids.

2.        The need to keep tapping knives sharp and the use of the sharpening
file. The need to have the tapping knife blades at the correct angle to
achieve a channel rather than a flat tapping cut. The knife used will be the
draw type normally used in Nigeria.

3.        The opening of the tapping cut, including the accurate marking of
tapping cut guide lines.

4.         The practice of tapping with emphasis on the following points:

     (a)   The gradual opening of the cut taking three to four days
           to reach optimum depth.

     (b)   The maintaining of the proper depth of cut from the guide
           lines at the upper end of the cut where tapping is usually
           too shallow.

     (c)   The maintenance of the proper slope (30°).

     (d)   Correct consumption of bark (not more than 2.S em per IS
           tappings).

     (e)   Proper fixing of spout and cup hanger. Initially the spout
           ~hou1d be one foot below the cut.  When the cut reaches to about
           two inches from the spout, it should be moved together with the
           cup hanger.

     (f)   Ensuring that the latex runs down the spout channel to the
           spout and the cup.

                 Details of Tapper Training Requirements


1.        The first opening for tapping, of the 2,000 hectares planted in
1977, will be in March 1983. The number of tasks involved will be 2,000 at
one task per hectare. Therefore, using an alternate daily tapping system,
1,000 tappers will have to be trained before tapping starts in 1983.

2.        In addition, special laborers who will help the Agricultural Assist
ants in opening the replantings for tapping, mast be trained. In 1982 there
will be 113 special laborers rising in 1986 to 168.

3.        Assuming that one instructor can train 14 tappers on each course,
that each course will last for two periods of six days and that the courses
will run from the beginning of October until the end of December, each
instructor can train 84 tappers. On this basis a minimum of 14 instructors
will be required for the first training courses in 1982. Allowing for
wastage, sickness etc. and for rational distribution in the four regions, 6
would be required for the Benin region and 3 for each of the other three
regions, making a total of 15. The number of instructors would rise to 40
in 1986 before the final area of 6,000 hectares are tapped.

4.        MANR has about 50 tapping instructors from whom the requirements
will be drawn. They will be selected for training on a 4 week course at the
RRIN before they themselves start instructing in October. Each instructor
would return to the RRIN for a similar course the following year.

5.        Details of the numbers of tappers and special laborers who must be
trained are shown below:

                           ,   ,
                            ~bber   Processina


General

1.        The ~id-Western State accounts for approximately 85% of Nigeria's
natural rubber production currently estimated at around 67,000 tons per annum.
About two thirds of this production is processed into crepe or crumb rubber
the remainder being sold in the form of Ribbed Smoked Sheet (RSS).

2.        Presently all grades of Nigerian rubber sell at a discount on world
markets. RSS sells at an average discount of about 3.5% and crumb rubber sells
at an average discount of about 5%. (See also Supplement 11). The elimination
of this disadvantage will necessitate improving processing standards to levels
that will meet internationally recognized technical specifications.

3.        In recent years the trend in natural rubber processing has been
towards producing technically specified block rubbers. Traditional methods
of processing natural rubber into Ribbed Smoked Sheet and Crepes involve a
considerable amount of drying time, thus locking up capital in processing.
Alongside these methods of processing, a system of visual grading evolved which,
although to some degree specifying physical qualities of the rubbers, was in
other respects subjective, hence leading to different interpretations. Certain
of the advantages that synthetic rubber possesses over natural rubber are the
technical specification of its properties in anyone batch with a guarantee of
its uniformity and its production in bales of 33-1/3 kg which are easily
handled and can be palletized for shipment and easy transport.
4.        The Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia (RRIM) developed a mechano
chemical process that produced natural rubber crumbs or pellets for subsequent
rapid drying in hot-air-dryers. During this process, it is possible to reduce
considerably the dirt that may have contaminated the rubber after its extrusion
from the tree. After drying, the rubber - in crumbs or pellet form - is
compressed to 33-1/3 kg blocks which are then packed in I-ton wooden pallets
that can be easily handled. The palletized blocks prevent the rubber from
becoming distorted and massed as is the case with RSS and crepes which are
traditionally packed in bare packed bales. This reduces the manufacturers'
costs in that no cutting and separation of large massed bales is required
before feeding into the mixer. In the late 1960's, the RRIM developed a sys
tem of grading based on the phYSical properties of the rubber, resulting in
what is now known as Standard Malaysian Rubber (SMR), the grades of which are
shown on each bale or block in a natural standardized manner.
                                                        SUPPLEMENT 8
                                                        Page 2

5.        The specifications designated for block rubbers are t in relative 

order of importance: 


           (i)  Dirt content. It is on this that the rubber is primarily
                graded, the figures 5,10,20 and 50 relating to the dirt
                content in parts per million. For grade 5 the mode of
                coagulation has to be declared and verified by a recognized
                authority/entity. !/

          (ii)  Plasticity Retention Index represents a certain measure
                of the likely resistance of the manufactured rubber to
                oxidate degeneration. It also supersedes tests for
                copper and manganese at one time mandatory.

         (iii)  Colour, volatile matter, ash, acetone extract are other
                tests which are normally mandatory and which describe the
                physical characters of the rubber for the manufacturer.

          (iv)  Mooney Viscosity and Wallace plasticity may also be called
                for in special cases.

6.        As other countries have developed block rubber production they have
established their own testing facilities and distinguishing symbols. Indonesia
with its Standard Indonesian Rubber (Sm) and Thailand with its Thai Tested
Rubber (TTR) are examples. If Nigerian block rubber is to be in a position
to compete on world markets with other countries' specified rubber, then it
is essential for Federal Government to establish a scheme for the control of
block rubber quality according to agreed specifications. The RRIN has re
cognized the need for providing block rubber testing facilities and a new
laboratory has been built at lyanamo for this purpose; when trained personnel
is avai1ab1e t the RRIN would become the coordinating and control laboratory
for all Nigerian technically specified rubbers. When considering a Nigerian
scheme for specifications t in view of the international work being directed
towards establishing Standard Natural Rubber (SNR), care should be taken to
avoid using these symbols which could create problems in the future.

Initial Assembly of Latex Coagulum
7.        The production of high quality technically specified block rubbers
from latex produced by large numbers of smallholders will necessitate organiz
ing the initial assembly of latex/coagulum in a way that provides the central
processing block rubber factories with a rugu1ar and sufficiently large
quantity of good quality raw material. At present the majority of smallholders
sell individually processed lump which is subsequently processed into crepe
or block rubbers equivalent to SMa 20 and 50. If in future the objective

!I    In the case of the Collection Centers to be established under the project
      the RRIN would verify the mode of coagulation used.
                                                        SUPPLEMENT 8
                                                        Page 3

is to produce the equivalent of SMR 5 and 10 from project replantings, then
collective action by smallholders at the initial assembly and first buyer
level must be developed.
8.        It is proposed under the project to establish Group Collection
Centers (GCC's) to which smallholders would bring field latex that would be
bulked, coagulated and transported to the central bloc~ factories within 24
hours. Individual smallholder's latex would be sieved', weighed, sampled for
dry rubber content (drc) and then bulked for coagulation according to standards
specified and certified by the BRIN. The Hid-West Rubber Development Agency
~A) would be responsible for the daily collection of coagulum and small~
holders would be paid in accordance with an agreed pricing formula determined
by a Rubber Price Policy Committee (See Supplement 11).

9.        The TCU would build the GCC' s. It has been estimated that about 50
farmers would use one GCC. Based on an average size of 2 ha, one GCC would
thus cater for 100 ha, and 200 GCC's would have to be built by TCU during
the 1982-1986 period to cater for the areas replanted under the project. How
ever, of the total number of GCe's required, 24 would be built during the
1977-1979 period for trials (see para 16).

10.        The GCC's would be located at village sites, and would be able to
handle an annual output of 205 tons coagulum (or with 60% drc 123 tons of dry
rubber). Investment costs are estimated at H5,OOO (see table 1). Chart 9463
attached to this Supplement gives a suggested diagramatic layout for a center.
GCe's would be operated by cooperatives and project smallholders would become
members of these cooperatives. TCU would build the GeC's, but the cooperatives
would repay to TCU the investment costs based on an annual depreciation charge
over a 10-year period. Annual recurrent expenditures, including the depreciation
charges, are estimated at Hl,500 (see table 2). Smallholders would be provided
with galvanized containers for transporting latex to the GeC's on bicycles and
it is anticipated that they would be prepared to transport latex from a radius
of about 5 m. Sales of cup lump and tree lace would also be channeled through
the GCe's.
Collection

11.       Coagulum would be collected daily from GCe's by MRDA. It is envi
saged that 7 ton tipper trucks with rear mounted cranes fitted with built-in
scales that would register the weight of the coagulum at each GeC, would be
used. One truck would make two trips a day from GCC's to central processing
factories which are concentrated around Bennin and Sapele. It is estimated
that peak production is 25% higher than daily average production and one
truck can, therefore, pick-up coagulum from 6 GCe's. 11 At full production,
collection costs are estimated at about H14.00/ton of-dry rubber (see table 3).

!I    1 GeC (100 hal would produce 123 ton dry rubber, or with 60% drc 205 tons
      coagulum. Thus over 250 tapping days 0.82 tons goagulum daily and with
      a peak of 25% over daily average a maximum of 1,025 tons coagulum at
      peak days.
                                                       SUPPLEMENT 8
                                                       Page 4

12.       Coagulum will be heaped on canvas sheets at the GCC site just before
the collecting truck arrives. Canvas sheets would be delivered to the GCC's
by the truck that collects the coagulum. Trucks would collect in accordance
with predetermined timetables and preferably the same truck would visit the
same 12 GCC's each day. GCC's would be notified well in advance of any
changes in the collection schedule. The driver would be accompanied by a
special laborer. The driver would be in overall charge of the collection,
operate the crane and issue a receipt to the GCe. The receipt would record
the weight of the coagulum. A sample of the coagulum would be taken and sent
to RRIN to determine its drc. The weighing scales should be robust, of simple
construction, and easy to maintain an acceptable limit of accuracy in the
field. As the smallholders (through the GeC's) are to be paid on the basis
of the weight loaded at the GeC's, it is important that they understand and
have confidence in the whole collection procedure.

13.       Collection procedures are subject to the findings of the evaluation
study of the trials (para 16).

Central Processing

14.       MRDA will deliver coagulum to any central processing factory that
operates to technical standards that will guarantee that rubber output from
these factories will meet the technical specifications required by inter
national markets. MRDA will not be tied to any specific processing company,
both because this would induce unfair competition, but also because it would
increase collection costs from the project areas more than necessary, given
the concentration of processing facilities around Benin and Sapele. The
trucks would deliver the coagulum to the factory, where the load would be
weighed and drc measured. A weigh receipt would be given to the driver, who
would give the factory copies of the weigh receipts issued by him to the
GCC's. This will enable the factory to determine each GeC's share in the
load. The factory would pay weekly to the cooperatives that operate the Gee's
in accordance with a price formula determined by the State's Rubber Price
Policy Committee. The factory would pay a margin directly to MRDA to cover
the latters collection costs.
15.       Levis and Peat has a crumb processing facility near Sapele with a
capacity of 12,000 tons annually. Goodyear has built a crumb processing
factory near Benin with an initial capacity of 12,000 tons annually, but
easily expandable to 24,000 tons. There are some 12 crepe factories operat
ing in the Mid-Western State with a total estimated capacity of about 60,000
tons annually. In addition to this, it is estimated that the present capacity
for sheet proceSSing is about 25,000 tons per year. The rubber processing
industry in the State is in a fairly strong position; it survived the civil
disturbances, market prices for rubber have improved compered with the early
1970's. By producing annually about 25,000 tons of dry rubber equivalent and
given the existing and planned crumb proceSSing capacity - estimated at around
50,000 tons annually - there is no justification for building additional
central processing crumb factories for project output.

Trials and Evaluation
16.       Under the project the proposed initial assembly and collection
systems would be tested. TCU would build 2 Gee's in each of the project
areas during the period of 1977-1979. Thus a total of 24 Gee's would be
built. The Monitoring and Evaluation Unit ~) would be responsible, in
collaboration with TeU and RRIN, for evaluating these trials and for making
final recommendations for initial assembly and collection to be used for
project plantings. MEV would hire consultants to assist in preparing the
report.

17.         MEU's evaluation report would include:

      (a)   Assessment of experience gained in initial assembly of latex
            during trial period.

      (b)   Assessment of experience gained in collection during trial period.

      (c)   Assessment of subsequent central processing during trial period.

      (d)   Assessment of MRDA's performance during trial period.

      (e)   Assessment of rubber processing capacity in Mid-Western
            State in relation to overall production and project output.

      (f)   Recommendations regarding technical standard for central

            costs.

      (h)   Workplan for locations of Gee's in the project areas in
            relation to actual replantings under the project.

      (i)   Recommendations regarding collection method to be used
            including a workplan for equipment and facilities required,
            the organizational set-up, and the flow of payments.

11   One GCC. 100ha, would produce 123 tons/dry rubber/year. This is equivalent
     to 205 tons coagulum/year (~DRC) which has to be transported. With 250
     tapping days this gives a transport of 0.82 tons a d~. Peak production is
     25% higher than average production or 1.025 ton/d~. One truck makes 2
     trips a d~ and visits 6 acc's on each trip. Since 200 acc's are planned.
     11 trucks are required and 2 reserves.

     profits. However, a margin of 100% is judged sufficient to cover these.

1.        The Rubber Institute of Nigeria at Iyanomo, eighteen miles from
Benin, was established in 1961 by the then Western Regional Government. It
was controlled by the Mid-Western State Government from 1963 and it was not
until 1972 that it became a Federal Institute. Since being taken over by the
Federal Government, more finance has become available and ambitious plans for
expansion of both facilities and staff have been put forward under the Third
National Development Plan 1975/80 ·. The proposed research staff establishment
is five principal Research Officers working on Agronomy, Plant Breeding,
Pathology, Soil and Plant Nutrition and Biochemistry (quality control). In
addition, there will be 4 to 5 Senior Research Officers, 8 Research Officers
and 15 Research Officers in training.

Past and Current Research at the RRIN

2.         Research already taking place at the RRIN includes:

     (a)   The testing of imported clones for their suitability for
           use under Nigerian conditions.

     (b)   The breeding of new clones from imported parent clones
           has been aimed at selecting some which are better suited
           to local conditions than their parents. This work is still
           in its very early stages, the first band pollinations having
           been made in 1965. The period between hand pollination
           and recommending a new clone for small ~ca1e planting in
           the field usually involves about 25 years.

     (c)   The testing of clonal seedling families.

     (d)   Various agronomic experiments including planting ~aterial,
           cover crop, intercropping, rootstock/scion compatibility,
           root development, induced mineral deficiencies and surveys
           of pH lev1es.

     (e)   Various tapping and yield stimulation trials.

                                                       Page 2
     (f)  Experiments on the control of diseases including root
          diseases, Hirds' Eye Leaf spot (llelminthosporium heveae) and
          diseases of the tapping panel.

Suggested Priorities for Future Research

3.        It is not to be expected that research work on a perennial tree
crop such as rubber can have progressed much at an institute such as the
RRIN, started in 1961, short of staff and suitable facilities and, until
now, handicapped by lack of funds. Recruitment of research staff has been
made moxe difficult by the absence of suitable housing at the Institute which
necessitates commuting from Benin, some 18 miles away. Junior staff housing
is also inadequate, electric power is inadequate and there are no telephones.
The scope of research work has been limited not only by the factors mentioned
above, but also by the absence of sufficient rubber trees of the correct type
and age for work on such problems as tapping, yield stimulation and control
of leaf, panel and root diseases. As a result, much of the work on such
aspects of research has been done on seedling rubber on. smallholdings where
esperimental design and control of recording have been difficult.

4.        The following principles should be borne in mind when planning the
priorities and scope of rubber research in Nigeria:

     (a)  The large majority of Nigerian rubber is in smallholdings.
          Research should therefore be geared to resolving agronomic
          and disease control practices which are at the same time
          effective and simple to apply.

     (b)  The need for smallholders to have some income during the 

          innnature phase needs to be taken into account. The 

          feasibility of economic intercropping with various crops 

          must be carefully investigated in districts that have 

          requirements and ecological conditions. 


     (c)  Hany of the practices at present employed in rubber growing
          have been directly introduced from other rubber producing
          countries. The different ecological conditions call for wide
          ranging studies in almost all aspects of nursery management,
          planting techniques, maintenance of immature rubber and care
          and exploitation of mature rubber.

     (d)  In the early years of an expanding Rubber Research Institute
          care must be taken to avoid projects verging on pure research
          (e.g. screening new chemicals as yield stimulatnts, evolving
          new laboratory methods, investigating the biology of latex etc.).
          Such work is adequately covered by other older and larger
          Institutes which publish their results. Practical application
          of such results should be the aim of the Rubber Research
          Institute. of Nigeria for many years to come.
                                                        SUPPLEMENT 9
                                                        Page 3

 5.        Areas of applied research to be given high priority are:

      (a)  Nursery
      (b)  Immature rubber
      (c)  Mature rubber
           (i)  tapping systems and yield stimulation
          (ii) control of panel diseases
      (d)  Choice of clones
      (e)  Soil chemistry
      (f)  Rubber quality control

  6.        Nursery. It is essential that research should be started to inves
  tigate the relative merits and costs of different types of planting material
. under Nigerian conditions. Comparisons should be made between seedlings
  budded in polybags, 18 months old seedlings budded in the nursery, 7 to 8
  month old seedlings budded in the nursery, and between brown and green bud
  ding. This research should include work on nursery fertilizer requirements,
  control of Helminthosporium leaf disease and the use of sprinkler irrigation
  systems. Attention should be paid to the degree of success of establishment
  in the field and the cost and feasibility of distributing the material to
  the smallholder.

 7.        Immature Rubber. With the objective of bringing even stands of
 rubber to tappeble size as soon as possible at economic cost under conditions
 likely to be encountered on smallholdings, research is urgently required on
 the following aspects of immature rubber: .

      (a)  Planting material (mentioned above);
      (b)  fertilizer rates and timing of applications;
      (c)  intercropping in the first two to three years with special
           reference to the effects of the fertilization and maintenance
           of the intercrops on the growth of the rubber, and the choice
           of intercrops from the point of view of management and labor
           requirements as well as profitability;
      (d)  methods of chemical weed control which could be safely and
           efficiently used by smallholders; and
      (e)  cheap and effective control of root disease, in particular
           white root rot (Rigidosporus lignosus) which is the most
           serious root disease in the Mid-Western State. The other
           principal root diseases, brown root rot (Phellinus noxius) and
           Armillaria, which is a serious problem in the South Eastern
           State, also require attention.

 8.        Mature Rubber. In order to obtain acceptable yields over as long a
 period as possible, research is required on:
                                                          SUPPLEMENT 9
                                                          Page 4

     (a),  Tapping Systems and Yield Stimulation. While S/2 d/2 100%
           tapping !I with a rest in the dry season appears at present
           to be the most suitable system for smallholders in Nigeria,
           research is required on other orthodox tapping systems and
           on novel methods of exploitation. With the discovery of
           ethylene producing chemicals such as ethrel as yield stimu
           lants, experiments are being carried out in other rubber
           producing countries on systems of exploitation which do not
           involve removel of shavings of bark from a tapping cut. The
           ethylene producing yield stimulants prolong the flow of latex
           from the severed latex vessels so that larger quantities of
           latex can be obtained from a series of small incisions in the
           bark. If this were to become a practical method of exploitation
           labor inputs in tapping would be reduced and the economic
           life of the rubber trees might be increased or reduced depending
           on the degree of stimulation. On smallholdings where there is
           a tendency to consume too much bark and tap too deeply, a novel
           method of exploitation of this kind would be particularly
           advantageous. In conjunction with tapping systems, experiments
           on the yield stimulation of middle aged rubber (after 10 years
           of tapping) and of old rubber (after 20 years of tapping) is
           also required.           .

     (b)  Control of Panel Diseases. A number of different chemical
          formulations are used for the control of Black Stripe and
          Mouldy Rot in Nigeria and in other countries. Some are
          more suitable for smallholders than others, and it is
          necessary to compare them, bearing the following points in
          mind:

          (1 ) toxic ity;
          (2)  cost;
          (3)  ease of preparation and application; and
          (4)  effectiveness of control of disease.

         The period of the year over which panel disease prophylaxis
         should be applied must be ascertained for districts and particular
         clones.

9.        Choice of Clones. The assessment of introduced clones and local
clones already produced must be continued so that the most suitable for
general or particular local conditions may be recommended. In this regard, it
should be borne in mind that although high yields are important, the ideal

y   S/2 d/2 100% is the international nomenclature used for describing the
    intensity of a tapping system involving !thalf spiral cut of the tapping
    panel every alternative day"; S/2 d/3 67% being a lIbalf spiral cut
    every third day.
                                                        SUPPLEMENT 9
                                                        Page 5

clone for smallholders would be one which could be expected to yield satisfac
torily over a long period with the minimum risk from wind damage and disease.
The further breeding of clones cannot be given immediate priority. Despite
the large numbers of artificial pollinations between selected parents made
at the Rubber Research Institutes of Malaysia and Ceylon and by research
organizations irt other rubber producing countries over the past fifty years,
very few of the legitimate clones so produced are recommended for commercial
planting. Two of the clones recommended for the Project, GT 1 and PRI07 are
primary clones derived from high yielding unselected seedling trees; only
PB 5/51 resulted from artificial pollination. It is possible that, by in
creasing the number of pollinations, and by improving their results in terms
of percentage success of pollination, which at present averages 5% or less,
a large enough number of legitimate seedlings would be produced to increase
significantly the chances of selecting elite clones. Such work would be
highly labor intensive and would utilize much land. A study in depth is
required to decide whether or not it would be justified, bearing in mind that
at least 20 years must elapse from the time of pollination to the point when
the new clones, could be recommended for planting even on an experimental
scale.

10.       Soil Chemistry. The nutrient requirements of rubber on the various
Nigerian soil types are largely unknown and current fertilizer recommendations
are essentially based on experience in other countries. There is therefore need
for an analytical laboratory to:

     (a)   carry out physical and chemical analyses of soils.
     (b)   carry out chemical analyses of leaf samples.

Such work would be helpful in a soil survey of the rebber growing areas in
Nigeria and also be of use in the interpretation of field fertilizer
experiments.

11.       Rubber Quality Control. The need for a standard Nigerian rubber
along the lines of the Malaysia SMR is widely recognized and the RRIN has
already constructed a laboratory to carry out the various testing procedures
to ensure that specifications will be met. Provided staff and equipment are
available, the laboratory is expected to be operational in 1976. Considerable
research and development work will be required in the laboratory before it can
function as an official testing station for a Nigerian block rubber of standard
specification that can match the specified rubbers produced by other countries.

12.       Staff constraints and specialist research workers. The staff of the
RRIN are too few in number at present and are insufficiently experienced to
carry out the applied research outlined above. The recruitment of staff
planned under the Third National Development Plan 1975/80 is likely to be of
young graduates who have had little or no experience of applied research or of
the problems associated with rubber growing. It is essential that sound
research should start as soon as possible and highly desirable that young
Nigerian research workers should have the guidance of specialist research
                                                       SUPPLEMENT 9
                                                       Page 6

workers. Such specialist research workers should have at least 5 to 10 years
experience in the appropriate aspects of rubber growing and processing. Suit
ably experienced Nigerians are probably not available and it may therefore
be necessary to recruit internationally. The specialist research staff would
be responsible not only for initiating and establishing the research programs
but also for guiding and training the Nigerian staff with whom they would work.
The Nigerian staff would thus gain first hand experience of planning research
programs, of experimental design methods and techniques and of analysing,
evaluating and reporting expertmenta1 results. While it may be desirable from
ttme to time to send some of the Nigerian staff to visit other Institutes
engaged in applied research on rubber, it is important that they work as part
of a team with the specialist research staff. After three to five years the
Nigerian staff should be sufficiently experienced to take over the research
programs.
13.       Under the third National Development Plan meaSUres have been
ta'~ento cong"~erahly strengthen the RRIN. Given this effort no additional
funds are required under the project.

Training School

14.       Present training facilities at RRIN are limited and under the Project
a training school would be built and equipped. Provision has been made for
engaging three expatriate instructors for three years, who would be responsible'
not only for instruction but also for training counterparts.

Rubber

1.        It is difficult to obtain accurate comparative yields per hectare
of planting material in Nigeria. The clones trials at the RRIN have not been
tapped long enough and what records there are consist of small replicated
plots from which it can be misleading to calculate yields per hectare. The
few yields records available from commercial estates are from areas which
have had different cultural histories and have been tapped on varying systems.
No yield records are available from properly maintained high yielding plant
ing material on smallholdings. The following estimates, in kg per hectare
have been made from what little information is available of the yields of the
three clones recommended for the Project under good estate conditions and with
specialized tapping systems:

                         PB 5/51             GT 1    PR 107          Mean

                2          900                800      625             775
                3         1175               1000      850            1000
                4         1375               1175     1025            1200
                5         1425               1250     1150            1275
                6         1600               1450     1175            1400
                7         1650               1575     1225            1475
                8         1700               1675     1350            1575

2.        Initial yields of the Project rubber will be lower than usual be
cause tapping (S/2 d/2 100%) will start in March of year 6 1/ when 50% of the
trees have reached tappable size whereas it is normal estate practice to wait
until 70% of the trees are tappable. A further 25% of the trees should reach
tappable size by October and the full stand should be tappable in year 7.

3.        It is expected that peak yields will be reached after 5 to 6 years
of tapping and that yields will then remain constant until twenty years of


1/   Year 0 is year of planting.
                                                            SUPPLEMENT 10

tapping have been completed. By this time all bark of first renewal (panels
C & D) ~ll have been tapped.

4.        No yield increases from stimulation have been taken into account.
D~elopments  in yield stimulation techniques may result in methods of yield
stimulation suitable for smallholders which, if applied to bark of first
renewal, may result in considerably higher yields than those estimated.

5.       The estimated yields from the Project rubber are detailed in table 1
and summatized below.

6.         Project production at full maturity would be 24,600 tons of dry
rubber.   Details on production are in table 2.

Intercrops

7.        Yields for the different intercrops per ha replanted with rubber
(see also Supplement 5) are as follows:

                                                  Kg. Per ha
                                                  of replanted
                         Intercrop                rubber

                        Maize                       1,500
                        Rice                        1,000
                        Cowpeas                       250
                        Yams                        5,000

It is assumed that 0.5 ha of each hectare planted to rubber would be available
for intercropping. However, in the case of rice it is assumed that a higher
portion of avenues is plantable and that therefore 0.6 ha of each hectare
planted to rubber would be available.

8.           Total production of intercrops under the project is in table 3.

                  A World Market for Natural Rubber


1.        During the post-war period the world 1/ market for elastomers 
that is the market for both natural and synthetic rubbers - expanded at an
average rate of about 6.2% per annum. The slower demand expansion in two
major consuming countries - the United States and the United Kingdom - was
more than offset by an above average rate of growth in all other countries.
World supplies of rubbers showed, during this period, a sharply different
behavior; while natural rubber supply increased by only 2.5% per annum between
1950-52 and 1970-72, synthetic rubber supply grew more than four times faster
(at about 10.5% per annum). Consequently, the share of natural rubber in the
market for new rubbers outside the centrally planned countries declined from
65% in 1950-52 to 33% in 1970 - 1972. The market share of natural rubber
declined faster in the United States than in any other consuming area, but the
advances of synthetic rubbers were common to all developed and developing
consuming countries. Synthetic rubbers held in 1972, 78% of the market for
all elastomers in the United States, down to 65% of the total in Japan, 64%
in Western Europe and 27% in India.

2.        The bulk of rubber is used in the manufacture of tires and other
automobile parts. In all developed countries demand for rubber in these
end-uses expanded much faster than available supply of natural rubber. The
gap was met by synthetic rubbers: first styrene-butadiene rubber and then
polybutadiene and polyisoprene. Styrene-butadiene rubber has been by far
the most important substitute for natural rubber. It accounts for about
60% of total synthetic rubber production and 65% of total world estimated
synthetic rubber capacity. Polybutadiene is the second most important type
of synthetic rubber, followed by polyisoprene. Polyisoprene is the closest
man-made approximation of the natural elastomer.

3.        Synthetic rubbers, a derivative of the rapidly expanding petro
chemical industry, competed with natural rubbers at two levels: availability
and prices. In the post-war period synthetic rubber producers were not only
able to rapidly increase their supplies to meet the growing market needs,
but were also able to progressively reduce the production costs and prices
of their products. Technological innovations and scale economies played a

                                                       Page 2

considerable role in making synthetic rubbers less expensive to produce, but
the key to the success of the industry was the seemingly unlimited availability
of chemical monomers at continuously declining prices. Synthetic rubber prices
declined sharply (by over 40%) during the sixties and natural rubber prices
followed suit, although fluctuations around this declining trend were wider in
the case of natural rubber. This different behavior largely reflected the
different supply elasticities of natural and synthetic rubber; the supply of
natural rubber is more price inelastic in the short run than that of synthetic
rubbers. Demand for all elastomers, which is by nature a derived demand, is
quite insensitive to price changes, but very sensitive to changes in aggregate
economic activity. The speed at which synthetic rubber producers can adjust
their supplies to variations in market demand (through capacity expansion
and/or higher utilization of existing capacity) is much greater than that of
natural rubber producers who cannot so easily transfer resources in and out
of rubber production. Although no clear consensus ~~ists on the actual area
of competition between natural and synthetic rubber, it is nevertheless, evi
dent that changes in relative prices do encourage substitution of one type
of rubber for another. !I

4.        In the past two years natural rubber prices have been fluctuating
fairly rapidly and have been characterized by two separate sets of circum
stances. The first rise, in 1912-13 was the result of the simultaneous
economic boom conditions allover the world, a boom which began to taper
off in the second half of 1913. World consumption of natural rubber increased
by 4% in 1912. Net exports of natural rubber, however, remained at the same
level as in 1911. Increased utilization in developed countries was not match
ed by an increase in imports, as stocks were heavily drawn upon. The stagna
tion of import demand kept prices down throughout most of the year, until
stock replenishments and anticipatory buying, fostered by monetary uncertain
ties, caused a sudden reversal of the trend in the closing months of 1912.
The price rise continued throughout most of 1913. The upturn in industrial
production in developed countries created a strong demand for rubber and
speculative buying also continued in 1913. Natural rubber prices - in terms
of RSS1, cif New York - increased from 16.5 ct./lb. in April 1912 to about
44 ct./lb. in July 1913.

5.        Towards the end of 1913, when the slowdown in industrial activity
in developed countries was beginning to affect demand for all elastomers and
prices of natural rubber were weakening, the availability pf chemical feed
stocks for synthetic rubber was severely curtailed by the oil crisis. Syn
thetic rubbers became scarce, their prices increased sharply and natural
rubber prices rebounded to new post-war peaks. RSSl, cif New York, averaged
at 55.5 ct./lb. in January 1914. These prices reflected the scarcity of all
elastomers, but also the expectation that the oil crisis would drastically

1/    Statistical analysis shows that the elasticity of substitution between
      natural and synthetic rubber is of the order of 0.3. The estimate,
      however, may be biased because reliable series of prices of synthetic
      rubber are not available.

 increase the cost and price of synthetic rubber.   Heavy speculations came to 

 characterize the natural rubber market. 


 6.        During 1974, with crude oil becoming progressively more available
 and chemical feedstocks again in adequate supply, the real dimensions of the
 oil crisis and its effects on synthetic rubbers began to become clearer. The
 production costs of the basic type of synthetic rubber - SBR 1500 - increased
 from 12-13 ct./lb. to about 23 ct./lb. and its market price from 17 ct./lb.
 to 32-33 ct./lb. The very high price differential between natural rubber
 and general purpose synthetic rubber could no longer be maintained and
 natural rubber prices - in terms of RSS1, cif. New York - declined to
 40 ct./lb. in June 1974.

 7.        The economic slowdown in most developed countries, coupled with the
 actual decline of real GNP in the United States and Japan, severely hurt
 world demand for all elastomers during 1974. Car production in Western
 Europe, Japan and the United States was badly affected. Consequently, con
 sumption of rubber in tires and other automobile parts declined substantially.
 Preliminary estimates for 1974 show that, on a world basis, consumption of
 all elastomers remained at the same level as in 1973. During the course of
 the year the supply-demand situation completely reversed itself: from one
 of excess demand at the beginning of the year to one of excess supply during
 the last 3-4 months of 1974. Prices of general purpose synthetic rubbers
 declined by 10-15 percent in the second half of 1974 and natural rubber prices
 continued to slide downward to about 30 ct./lb. in December, despite some
 attempts to support the market through production cutbacks and stockpiling
 by the Malaysian government.

 8.        The short-term price outlook for natural rubber does not appear to
 be very bright. Demand for all elastomers is expected in 1975 to increase
 only marginally above 1974 levels and substantial over-capacity in the syn
 thetic rubber industry is likely to keep general purpose synthetic rubber
 prices at depressed levels. Natural rubber, however, will marginally bene
 fit from the above-average growth of some end-uses in which it has a relative
 advantage over synthetic rubbers - heavy truck and farm equipment tires - and
 from the growth of radial car tires, where the proportion of natural rubber
 is greater than in crossply tires. Demand for natural rubbers is, therefore,
 expected to increase moderately above 1974 levels. Natural rubber prices are
 anticipated to recover somewhat from the low levels of December 1974 and to
 average at about 33 ct./lb. (RSS1, cif New York).

  9.        World consumption of all rubbers is projected to grow at an average
·annual rate of 5.4% between 1973 and 1980 (as compared with 6.2% per annum
  registered between 1960-62 and 1970-72). 1/ Over the same period, world supply

l/    Projected on the basis of the relationship between total elastomers 

      consumption and industrial production. Regression analysis shows 

      that a 1% increase in industrial production in OECD countries is 

      associated with a 1.18% increase in the demand for all elastomers. 

      About 98% of the variation in elastomer consumption is explained by 

      the growth in industrial production. 

                                                         SUPPL:m1ENT 11
                                                         Page 4

of natural rubber is forecast to grow at some 5.6% per annum at a considerably
faster rate than in the sixties. II Improvements in yields are expected to
account for most of the growth in-rubber output in the seventies. Production
capacity of synthetic rubbers is forecast to be around 8.8 million tons by
1977. 21 Extrapolation of the trend would put capacity at 10.0 million tons
by the-end of the seventies. To arrive at the actual production necessary to
meet total elastomers demand by 1980, the utilization to capacity ratio in
the industry would have to rise to about 85%. The normal level of production
in the synthetic rubber industry has been in the past around 75% of total rated
capacity. It can, therefore, be expected that in the latter part of the
seventies, synthetic rubbers will remain in tighter supply than in the sixties
and early seventies. Natural rubber producers are then unlikely to encounter
serious difficulties in disposing of their supplies. In fact, a larger than
expected increase in natural rubber output - for example, through a more
extensive use of Ethrel - could possibly allow natural rubber to marginally
increase its share of world total rubber consumption.

10.       Excluding that eventuality, consumption of natural rubber outside
the centrally planned countries is forecast to be growing during the rest of
the seventies at an average of 5.8% per annum. A reduction in the rate of
growth of natural rubber utilization in centrally planned countries is anti
cipated to increase availabilities for the rest of the world. According to
this forecast, synthetic rubber consumption would increase at 5.2% between
1973 and 1980 and natural rubber would, therefore, maintain about 32% of the
world market for all elastomers (see Table 1). World net exports of natural
rubber are expected to grow during this period of time at 4.9% per annum, an
increase of about 1% in their average rate of expansion with respect to the
sixties.

11.       Analysis of the relationship between crude oil, basic chemicals
and general purpose synthetic rubber costs indicates that if one assumes
that crude oil prices will be in 1980 at about $8.65 per barrel in 1974
constant dollars, SBR prices should be between 29 and 34 ct./lb. Correspond
ingly, RSSl, c.i.f. New York, should be selling at 31 to 36 ct. lIb. in 1974
constant dollar terms. In 1980 dollar terms, the price of natural rubber is
expected to be between 51 and 59 ct./lb.

12.       Beyond 1980 the prospects of natural rubber still appear to be quite
favorable on the demand side. Total demand for all rubbers can be forecast
to grow at about 6% per annum between 1980 and 1985. Potential supply of
natural rubber - with existing acreage and available production technology
is, on the contrary, projected to grow during this period at a much slower
rate than in the seventies - at 3.7% per annum between 1980 and 1985 (see
Table 1). This implies that the 1985 market share of natural rubber outside
the centrally planned countries would decrease to about 29% because of insuffi
cient supplies. To maintain 32% of the market - a feasible objective in terms

1/      Between 1960-62 and 1970-72 world production of natural rubber increased
        at an average rate of 3.9% a year.

of the technical-economic potential of natural rubber - producers should in
crease their output at 5.5% per annum between 1980 and 1985. The likely
shortfall in natural rubber availability in the 1980's points to the need of
increasing natural rubber supplies beyond what appears to be possible under
present expansion plans.

13.       From the point of view of future prices, the prospects of natural
rubber appear to be favorable, only if one assumes that crude 011 prices will
remain at $8.65 per barrel, in constant 1974 dollar terms, and that no major
shift in the location of the petrochemical industry away from developed
countries and in the direction of the basic raw material source - oil - will
take place in the 1980s. A drop in the price of oil would again make the
synthetic rubber feedstocks cheaper and increase the relative competitiveness
of general purpose synthetic rubbers. Similarly, a large, uncoordinated ex
pansion of production capacity for petrochemicals in oil producing countries
would increase the supply of these products and - other things being equal 
depress their prices to the advantage of synthetic rubber manufacturers. To
guard against the possibility of lower chemical prices in the 1980s, the long
run equilibrium price of natural rubber is forecast to be around 33 ct. lIb.
in 1974 constant dollar terms.


                          B.   Nigerian Market


14.       Prices for West African Rubbers. Compared with Malaysian natural
rubbers, West African natural rubbers sell at a discount in the world market.
Natural rubber marketed through the major commodity markets tends to fluctuate
in price depending on its origin, shipment position, grade, quality, and such
other factors as reliability of shipping. Unfortunately a direct price com
parison grade for grade with Malaysian natural rubber is difficult, as no
official sheet or crumb prices are quoted by West African producers. In the
absence of any standardization West African crumb producers sellon the
basis of their own marks and there are numerous brand names. Most producers,
however, have tended to follow the SMR standards.

15.          In the absence of any official system of quality control, technical
specifications of West African natural rubber are difficult to judge. This is
a major factor which accounts for the discount of West African natural rubber.
Frei;::;ht costs from West Africa to European ports are lower than freight costs
from Halaysia to Europe, but the major disadvantage is that services from West
Africa to European ports are neither so regular nor reliable as from Malaysian
ports. This tends to be reflected in the price since large manufacturers now
purchase on the basis of precise delivery which puts West Africa at a dis
advantage. The larger discount for crumb rubber compared with sheet rubber
is also due to the fact that much Hest African crumb is still at a market
promotional stage.

16.       Comparing prices by origin of selected crumb and sheet grades
(details are in Table 2) indicates that t,fest African rubber (assuming an
                                                       SUPPLEMENT 11
                                                       Page 6

estate mark with a satisfactory reputation for quality and shipping) is dis
counted to competitive Malaysian grades by around 3.3%-4.1% for sheet rubber
and by around 4.2%-5.6% for crumb rubber. However, the range of discounts
is frequently much wider depending on specific market conditions.

17.       Trends in Production. Nigeria is the second largest producer of
natural rubber in West Africa (after Liberia) but its production and exports
are declining (see Supplement 1 and also table 3). Production amounted to
77,000 tons in 1966, fell to an average of about 56,000 tons during the years
of civil disturbance and recovered to an average of about 62,000 tons in the
1970-1973 period. Exports amounted to 71,000 tons in 1966, dropped to an
average of about 52,000 tons during the years of civil disturbance and dropped
even further to an average of about 50,000 tons in the 1970-73 period.

18.        Local consumption has increased rapidly during the last few years.
It was estimated at 17,000 tons in 1973 as compared with 6,000 tons in 1970
and 5,000 tons in 1965. This implies a growth rate of about 4% annually
during the 1965-1970 period, but 41% annually during the 1970-1973 period.
Future domestic consumption will depend on investments made-in the rubber
manufacturing industry in Nigeria. Details however are not available on
future investment plans in the rubber manufacturing industry, although there
are indications that manufacturing within Nigeria will continue to expand.
If the 1965-1973 trend continues domestic consumption could reach 25,000 tons
by 1980 and 40,000 tons by 1990.

19.       The supply of rubber has certain inherent inflexibilities. Since
it is a tree crop that has a long gestation period between planting and har
vesting, output cannot be changed from year to year. Project plantings would
be in full production from 1990 onwards. Within a decade an estimated 50% of
sma11ho1dings in the Mid-Western State will have passed economic age. There
fore production is estimated to first decline from its present level of 67,000
tons, before it would increase again. Under generous assumptions Nigerian
production around 1990 is estimated bet~veen 75,000 - 85,000 tons (see table 4).
Based on these projec!ions exports from Nigeria - given increasing production
and domestic consumption - will most likely stagnate or even decline.

20.       Marketing of Rubber. Rubber is a nonscheduled crop and as such the
marketing of it is not regulated by a Marketing Board. In Nigeria Marketing
Boards regulate such export crops as cocoa, groundnuts and palm produce, and
a number of other commercial crops. The relatively noninterference in the
marketing of rubber has had the disadvantage that no formal standards exist
for Nigerian rubber. FMG is aware of this and recognizes the need to estab
lish a rubber quality control scheme according to agreed specifications.
However, channelling the marketing through a Marketing Board is not contem
plated.

21.       The smallholder taps his rubber trees and subsequently transforms
the latex into sheets or lumps. In the northern part of the rubber growing
areas smallholders demonstrate a preference for lumps while in the southern
part sheets are more preferred. Lumps are collected from the farmer mostly
                                                        SUPPLEMENT 11
                                                        Page 7

by middlemen who in turn sell to processing factories. However, factories
also sent their own lorries around to collect lumps directly and, MRDA also
operates also a lump purchase scheme; either with its own vehicles or with
vehicles provided by a factory, MRDA collects the lumps and pays a price
agreed by the factory. Large estates and factories sell their rubber through
brokers or agents or directly under their otm brand names. Smallholders sell
their sheets to villagers who own small smokehouses, or in the case of co
operatively owned smokehouses smoke their own sheets. Smoked sheets are sold
either directly or through middlemen to packers/exporters, who clear, grade,
and sort the sheets and subsequently export these sheets or sell them locally.
The cooperatively owned smokehouse sell their sheets through their unions,
which have contacts with brokers overseas. Quality is not at premium under
present marketing arrangements since middlemen pay a flat price per lb/lump
or sheet, regardless of quality.

22.        Sales tax and export duties on rubber have been abolished by FMG
early in 1974. However, the Mid-Western State still levied, as of October
1974, a tax of 0.25 kobo per pound rubber whenever the cif price of rubber
is over 33 kobo per kilo. However, opposition against this State tax is
strong, since it gives a disadvantage to rubber producers in the Mid-\~estern
State compared with the other States of the Federation, and the tax has been
abolished.


             C.   Pricing Policy for the Purchase of Coagulum


          A price policy committee would be appointed by 1977 to determine
the price to be paid for latex/coagulum of smallholders. Membership of Rub
ber Price Policy Committee (RPPC) would include:

     (a)   Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance - Chairman;

     (b)   Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture and
           Natural Resources;

     (c)   Registrar of Cooperative Societies or such other person
           as the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Trade and
           industries may designate;

     (d)   General Manager of TCU - Secretary:

     (e)   General Manager of MRDA;

     (f)   two representatives of the rubber processing industry; and

     (g)   two representatives of the rubber smallholders.

24.       RPPC would establish the principles to be applied in determining
the price to be paid for latex/coagulum - collected from the smallholders at
                                                       SUPPLEMENT 11
                                                       Page 8

the Group Collection Centers - by the central processing factories. They
would determine a purchasing price formula which the companies would be obliged
to apply in calculating the price they would pay for latex/coagulum. Using
this formula the factories would calculate, from month to month, or other
suitable time span to be agreed by RPPC, the price to be paid for latex/coagulum.
After approval of RPPC these prices would be announced and widely publicised.
Any departure from this formula would be referred back to RPPC for approval
prior to implementation.

25.       The price paid per ton coagulum/latex would be determined from the
revenue received for the sale of rubber on the world market after allowing
margins for central processing in the factories and for collection by MRDA.
The margin would relate to actual costs including depreciation, taxes and
financial charges. Financial charges would be adequate to provide a reason
able return on the capital investment, which would be sufficient to cover
interest charges and margins for building up reserves and paying dividends.
The return on capital would be measured on the basis of a percentage of net
revalued fixed assets plus a reasonable allowance for working capital; this
percentage would be agreed by RPPC within a suggested 10% - 15% range.

26.       Having deducted all margins calculated on a cost/ton rubber basis,
from the revenue received from the sale of one ton of produce, the price per
ton of rubber net of all cost is known; this is the base price. Applying
the appropriate percentage drc to this base price will then give the price
to be paid per ton latex/coagulum.

27.       The cooperatives will know the costs they have to make to operate
the GCC's (including the repayment of investment costs to TCU). If the price
per ton latex/coagulum is announced they can then easily determine the price
the smallholder will receive for the latex he brings to his GCC by taking into
account their operating costs (during the repayment period also loan repay
ments by smallholders) and drc of latex compared with coagulum. The coopera
tives would send summaries of sales and repayments to TCU for monitoring and
TCU would report regularly to RPPC about the differentials between prices
received per ton/coagulum by the cooperatives and prices paid by cooperatives
to smallholders for a ton of latex.

28.       The factories would pay the cooperatives the announced price/ton of
coagulum and they would pay directly to MRDA the margin agreed by RPPC for
collection.

29.       Under the project the formal establishment of RPPC would be re
quired by 1977, so that pricing policy would be tested during the GCC trial
period in order to obtain more information about the cost structure in the
rubber industry and to test different formulae with actual results. MEU
would monitor and evaluate the results of trying the pricing policy during
the GCC trial period and report its findings in its final report.

           D.    Calculation of Economic and Financial Farmgate

                            Prices for Rubber


30.       For the purpose of this project the economic and financial prices
for rubber have been calculated using the world market price projections for
1985. Price forecasts are in Table S. They refer to the spot price of RSS1
cif New York.

31.       It has been assumed that rubber produced under the project would be
exported and would be equivalent to SMRS (80%), SMR10 (10%) and SMR20 (10%).
Price differentials between SMRS, 10 and 20 and RSS1 are given in Table 6.
Price discounts between SMR10 and 20, and RSS1 have been taken into account
in arriving at the cif price for these rubber qualities. However, the
positive price differential between SMR5 and RSS1 (1.3%) has not been taken
into account in determining the cif value of SMR5, thus it has been assumed
that the cif price SMR5 equals the cif price RSS1. It has further been
assumed that the cif price Europe would be equal to the cif price New York.

32.       Farmgate prices for rubber equivalent to SMR5, 10 and 20 are in
Tables 7, 8 and 9. Based on the assumption that 80% of production would be
equivalent to SMR5, 10% to SMR10 and 10% to SMR20 the average farmgate price
for rubber produced under the project has been calculated as follows:

          Average farmgate prices at different spot prices of RSSI are
summarized in Table 10.

          Prices to be obtained for nlbber have been calculated as export
parity prices. Prices to be obtained for timber and intercrops have been
based on prices prevailing during appraisal. Prices for firewood ranged

from N 0.40 to N 1.00 depending on distances from the main towns. For valu
ing the sales of the old rubber trees the lower estimate of N 0.40 has been
used. Prices to be obtained for intercrops are as follows:

g/  85% ot Nigeria's area under rubber (251,000 ha) is Mid-Western State
    and about 9,000 ha in Mid-Western State is estate which leaves about
    200,000 ha in smallholder rubber, 50% of which will be uneconomic
    within a decade.
11  Presently 9,000 ha planted on estates but including present plans
    for expansion, this will increase to 11,000'ha.
~ Mainly Western State and South Eastern State. Assumes production to
    
    be constant in other Nigeria.
