Its production,\n            however, is small in relation to world production.\n            Therefore, its output at any given time is not likely to\n            have any major effect on the world market; even if its\n            output were to double or even treble, the impact on world\n            prices would still be negligible. Nigeria can thus be\n            classified as a 'price taker' in the world market\n            for natural rubber. Within relatively wide limits its\n            production and investment decisions will not lead to world\n            distortions. Rubber grows throughout southern Nigeria but\n            the main rubber growing areas of Nigeria are in the Benin\n            and Delta areas of the Mid-Western State. Rubber grows\n            mainly on smallholdings. There are some large estates, both\n            private and Government owned, but compared with countries\n            like Malaysia and Indonesia estates playa less dominant\n            role. Most of the rubber in Nigeria was planted during the\n            1940s and during the Korean War. Significant areas are\n            either completely untapped or partly tapped and there is\n            visible evidence of poor maintenance and poor tapping\n            standards. Yields are low and most rubber is now uneconomic.\n            If Nigeria is to sustain its rubber industry, major\n            replanting is urgently needed."}, "docdt": "1975-09-15T00:00:00Z"}
