provide new housing for\n            about 3,000 families; improve the sanitation, health\n            conditions and access to public services for about 3,500\n            families in existing slums; and increase employment\n            opportunities in the project areas. The project includes:\n            (a) housing sites and services at Tung Song Hong for about\n            3,000 housing units, including land and infrastructure, core\n            houses with sanitary facilities, materials loans for house\n            completion through self-help, community facilities,\n            commercial and small-scale industrial areas and loans to\n            small-scale businesses; (b) slum improvement at five slums\n            affecting nearly 2,300 dwelling units, including land\n            acquisition, infrastructure improvements, community\n            facilities, loans to small-scale businesses and social\n            support programs; and (c) technical assistance to NHA,\n            including 66 man-months of consultancy and advisory\n            services, training/fellowships and project monitoring and\n            evaluation. The project inherently entails some risk, being\n            the first of its kind to be undertaken by NHA. The demand\n            for site and services units and the willingness of slum\n            residents to pay for improvements have yet to be proven in\n            Thailand, but the risks are considered reasonable in view of\n            the pilot nature of the project in dealing with shelter pro"}, "docdt": "1978-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
