         the Indian Railways for two years; 1975/76 and 1976/77. The\n            project consists of new and ongoing works which are required\n            to meet projected increase in demand for freight and\n            passenger services and to continue with cost reduction\n            measures, including modernization of equipment. It also\n            includes necessary spare parts for maintenance of\n            locomotives and rolling stock. The main elements of the\n            project include procurement of equipment, materials and\n            components essential to the manufacture of 350 locomotives,\n            about 300 electric multiple units, about 1,500 coaches and\n            about 20,000 wagons (four-wheeler equivalent), and for\n            electrical tract and other works."}, "docdt": "1975-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
