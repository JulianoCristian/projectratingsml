Social Protection Project\n            will reduce poverty by providing temporary income support to\n            poor, unemployed workers hired in the TRABAJAR public works\n            program.  The project builds on the experience of the first\n            Social Protection Project, which safeguarded critical social\n            programs during 1995-96 and provided income support to the\n            poor unemployed, including through the first phase of\n            TRABAJAR.  The project will be composed of many sub-projects\n            which will be presented by municipal and provincial\n            governments, private groups, and national organizations.\n            They will be small, quickly implemented, labor-intensive\n            investments in the areas of economic and social\n            infrastructure.  The menu of projects which are eligible for\n            financing by the TRABAJAR program includes minor\n            construction, repair, expansion, or remodeling of schools,\n            health facilities, basic sanitation facilities, small roads\n            and bridges, small dams and canals, community kitchens and\n            centers, and tourist centers.  The program encourages\n            projects that are located in poor communities.  The second\n            component of the project will be project administration, or\n            management of the program by the Ministry of Labor and\n            Social Security.  This will include project management,\n            monitoring, and supervision costs."}, "docdt": "1997-06-02T00:00:00Z"}
