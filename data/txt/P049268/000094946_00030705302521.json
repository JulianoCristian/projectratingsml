Most targets set for the project were met or\n            exceeded, and project management was very competent. Project\n            sustainability is likely. World Bank and Borrower\n            performances were satisfactory with Borrower performance in\n            some respects, highly satisfactory. Lessons learned include\n            the following: Self-targeted public works programs can\n            effectively direct the majority of cash transfers to the\n            poor, provided the wage rate is set no higher than the\n            ruling market wage for unskilled labor. Close monitoring is\n            needed during project execution to ensure that the targeting\n            is working and to identify problems in the project cycle or\n            poor performance in some localities. While the labor\n            requirement and low wages rate effectively target benefits\n            to the poor, proactive measures such as program promotion\n            and technical assistance directed to less well endowed\n            municipalities and nongovernmental organizations are needed\n            to ensure that the poor in these communities benefit from\n            the national program. Effective subproject evaluation,\n            monitoring, and supervision are critical to ensuring that\n            the subprojects produce benefits for poor communities that\n            go beyond temporary income transfers to the unemployed.\n            Demand-driven programs present specific management\n            challenges, in that it can be difficult to predict and\n            manage the inflow of subproject proposals."}, "docdt": "2000-01-14T00:00:00Z"}
