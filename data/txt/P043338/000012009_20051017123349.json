Lessons first indicate\n            that the strategy to have investors own, and run the\n            Palestine Mortgage and Housing Corporation (PMHC), while\n            having commercial banks as retailers, did correctly allocate\n            the risks. However, the project could have benefited from a\n            more nuanced understanding of the impediments that private\n            actors faced, and might have devised efficient strategies to\n            address them. For this project, those issues included\n            property registration, laws and regulations concerning the\n            pledging of property, and the entire regulatory environment\n            for the mortgage business. However, actual reforms would not\n            likely have been successful without the imminent prospect of\n            real loans waiting to be made. Likewise, projects with\n            private entities at their core, should be structured,\n            recognizing that neither the Bank and nor the borrower can\n            control the pace of implementation. A second lesson\n            addresses how to maximize the synergy among Bank operations,\n            for on a subject as broad as housing policy, there is a\n            great need for a coordinated message, not only to the\n            Housing Ministry, but to Finance, the Central Bank, the\n            Planning Ministry, the Local Government Ministry, the\n            Justice Ministry and more. Although the Bank had operations\n            and dialogue with all of these parties, there was no\n            mechanism to coordinate or integrate advice for improving\n            project outcomes. This is probably a significant missed\n            opportunity that could have improved the pace, if not the\n            quality of product implementation."}, "docdt": "2005-09-29T00:00:00Z"}
