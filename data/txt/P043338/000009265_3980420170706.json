cost housing options can be achieved\n            and that financing can be made available on a sustainable\n            basis. The specific objectives of the project are to: a) put\n            in place institutions, policies and actions necessary to\n            building and sustain a well-functioning housing sector; b)\n            make housing more affordable by initiating the development\n            of a competitive, market-based mortgage system, accompanied\n            by well-targeted assistance to lower -income households; and\n            c) reduce house prices for lower income households by\n            reducing obstacles to the availability of land; promoting a\n            competitive development process for lower cost alternatives;\n            and providing assistance for the capital costs of\n            infrastructure. The three project components are: a)\n            institutional and policy development component; b) housing\n            finance component, including, a secondary mortgage facility,\n            a mortgage indemnity fund, and a housing assistance fund; c)\n            housing development component which will help finance the\n            off-site infrastructure and basic community facilities, a\n            demonstration site, and construction finance."}, "docdt": "1997-03-18T00:00:00Z"}
