REPORT AND RECOCMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE EMPRESA NACIONAL DE ELECTRICIDAD, S.A. (ENDE)
FOR A FOURTH POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the ampresa Nacional de Electricidad, S.A. (ENDE) with the
Guarantee of the Republic of Bolivia for the equivalent of US$25 million
to help finance a program for the expansion of electric power generation
and transmission. The loan would have a term of 25 years, including four
years of grace, with interest at 8-1/2% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
lntroduction
2.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and
Prospects of Bolivia" (786a-BO) dated July 28, 1975, was distributed to
the Executive Directors. Country data sheets are attac,hed as Annex I.
Background
3.        Despite the increasing importance of petroleum and natural gas
exports, as well as significant mineral deposits, Bolivia remains one of
the poorest countries in South America. The majority of the population is
engaged in traditional agriculture. Only a small part of the labor force
is employed in the mocLern sectors. The infrastructure is primitive and the
road and rail networks: cover only a fraction of the country. The combination
of strong traditional ties within the Indian communities and geographic,
health and educational obstacles to population mobility has perpetuated the
demographic concentration on the barren, windswept and dry 10-15 thousand
foot plateau, the Altiplano. About half of Bolivia's population lives a
physically, culturally and economically isolated subsistence existence in
this inhospitable region which is rich in mineral deposits but limited in
agricultural potential.
4.        The 1952 revolution sought to put an end to the dual structure
which had characterized Bolivia's economy since colonial times and to
deprive the landowning and mining oligarchy of its economic base. This
objective was only partially achieved. Progress was made in eradicating
feudal relations, distributing the land and eliminating obstacles to social
mobility. The agrarian reform and the nationalization of large mines,
however, were followed by falling production. GDP declined in the 1950s
and did not recover to its pre-1952 level until 1961. During the subsequent
decade, output increased steadily at an average annual rate of around 5%,
providing for average annual per capita income increases of 2.5%. As a result,
GNP per capita which had fallen by 24% in the 1952-60 period had recovered
by 1970, to the 1952 level and was more equally distributed. However, the
momentum of economic growth was again lost in 1970/71 because of political

instability associated with declining private investment and deteriorating
public finances. The deterioration of public finances reflected a structural
flaw in the economy. Bolivia's public sector is proportionately one of the
largest in South America and a source of livelihood for a sizeable segment
of the population. With the scarcity of employment opportunities in the
private sector, pressures to expand the ranks of public servants proved
difficult to resist. Increased expenditures on wages and salaries, combined
with a weak tax system, left few resources for investment. Moreover, the
inability of the public sector to generate adequate savings limited its
capacity to utilize external assistance.
5.        On coming to power in 1971, President Banzer faced the need to
provide jobs for the unemployed and to revitalize investment and output
growth. This need was initially faced in the context of a sharp deterioration
in Bolivia's terms of trade which produced a weakening in the balance-of-
payments and a further deterioration in public finances and eventually
resulted in a substantial devaluation in 1972. At the same time, however,
more rational economic policies were put into effect. To establish a more
favorable climate for private investment, new laws offering guarantees and
incentives to private investors were promulgated and claims arising from
earlier nationalizations were settled. The Government also improved public
administration and the pricing policies of some public undertakings. These
policies were successful in increasing private investment and in bolstering
the rate of growth.
Recent Economic Developments and Prospects
6.        The most important events affecting recent economic performance
have been the substantial improvement in the terms of trade in 1974
and the subsequent deterioration last year. The sharp increases in
petroleum and mineral prices in 1974 allowed a simultaneous and large
expansion of both consumption and investment and brought about an unprece-
dented improvement in public finances and the balance-of-payments. After
current deficits in 1970-73 the Central Government achieved savings equivalent
to one-third of its capital expenditure in 1974. For the public sector as
a whole, savings in 1974 exceeded 10% of GDP and covered nearly 90% of
capital expenditure. On the balance of payments side, the terms of trade
gain in 1974 was equivalent to about 11% of GDP and the trade surplus
exceeded US$150 million. There was a current account surplus of some US$50
million and net capital inflows approached US$90 million, nearly four times
their 1973 level, as a result of substantially higher loan disbursements to
the public sector and increased foreign investment associated with hydro-
carbon exploration. The net foreign reserve gain in 1974--US$125 million--
brought total reserves to US$156 million, equivalent to 3.7 months of imports,
a high point in Bolivia's recent economic history.
7.        After the terms-of-trade related financial improvement in 1974, a
deterioration took place in 1975 - caused by a worsening of the terms-of-trade
and the impact of the world wide economic recession. Mineral exports fell
by well over 20%. There was a decline of mineral prices approximating 13%,
on weighted average, and the volume of sales of most minerals fell as a direct



- 3 -
result of the recession and unloading of speculative stocks accumulated
during the commodity boom of 1973/74. Efforts by the International Tin
Council to sustain prices by imposing export quotas did not produce the
expected results. Exportable surpluses of crude petroleum were significantly
reduced foi "he second year in a row due to falling production and rapidly
rising domestic consumption of hydrocarbon derivatives.   A significant
price increase for natural gas was obtained from Argentina, but this could
not compensate for the overall decline in export earnings. Based on
preliminary estimates, merchandise exports in 1975 declined by 20%, while
imports rose by nearly one-third in the wake of the start-up of new public
investment projects and the liberalization of imports for consumer durables
and motor cars earlier in the year. The current account deficit approached
US$220 million and despite substantially increased disbursements of medium
term loans to the public sector, there was a loss of net foreign exchange
reserves of some US$60 million. Reserves declined to US$100 million, or
about two months of imports.
8.        Bolivia's terms of trade are expected to again improve in 1976 and
beyond. Mineral prices appear to have bottomed out in 1975 and hydrocarbon
prices have resumed their rising trend. Furthermore, with gradual econamic
recovery in industrialized countries mineral export volumes should increase.
Recent Government measures to increase prices of domestically consumed
petroleum products, especially of gasoline, should improve exportable
surpluses.  The outlook for 1976, therefore, is for somewhat accelerated
growth and an improved fiscal and balance-of-payments position.
9.        Economic growth prospects over the medium- to longer-term depend
on the Government's ability to increase savings and stimulate investments,
particularly those for developing the country's hydrocarbon, mineral and
agricultural resources. Government measures designed to broaden the revenue
base have begun to shIow results. The firm wage policies that have been
applied since 1974 have resulted in a reduction of inflation to an annual
rate of about 8%. Investment in mining and hydrocarbons is accelerating.
Intensified exploration for hydrocarbons by the state owned petroleum company
and private foreign companies is underway and may lead to significantly
increased production and export of crude petroleum and natural gas which
would stimulate an acceleration of economic growth towards the end of the
decade.
Debt Service and Creelitworthiness
10.       Service on external public debt in 1974 amounted to 13.6% of
exports of goods and non-factor services net of investment income abroad.
This represents a considerable reduction from the debt burden of previous
years which frequently absorbed 15-20% of net export receipts. Average
terms of the externa]. debt outstanding have remained soft, reflecting the
high proportion of concessionary aid channeled to Bolivia. Average interest
in 1973 was 3.5% and average maturity about 22 years.



11.       This position is bound to change, however, as it can be expected
that lending terms will become harder and the share of loans on conventional
terms will increase. Of new loans attracted during 1974 and 1975, over 40%
were financial and suppliers' credits. With substantial disbursements
envisaged during the next six years, the service on external public debt will
move well above its historical average by 1977/78. However, as a result of
growing exports, the debt service ratio should decline in subsequent years.
In view of the nature and growing size of Bolivia's debt, prudence in selecting
and utilizing external capital will have to become an essential element of
debt management.
12.       Bolivia enjoys a substantial resource base in agriculture, minerals
and hydrocarbons which has to be developed to sustain rapid economic growth
and, in particular, rapid expansion of export earnings in the foreseeable
future. If production in the export sectors can be increased as planned and
prices for the country's major export products (oil, gas, minerals) are
adequate, Bolivia can be considered creditworthy for substantially increased
amounts of external lending on conventional terms. Nevertheless, some
additional lending on soft terms is justified by Bolivia's poverty and its
large and continuing external capital requirements. The country will require
substantial external financing of investment to supplement the domestic
savings effort at least until the early 1980s. While the Government is
making a serious effort to mobilize domestic resources and prepare a develop-
ment program, implementation of this program will require external assistance
well in excess of the foreign exchange component of suitable projects
presently available for international financing.   Although substantiallg
increased suppliers' and financial credits will probably become available,
they should prudently cover not more than 35% of the public capital inflows
required during 1975-80 for meeting a GDP growth target of 6-7% annually.
The remainder should be obtained on softer terms, preferably from inter-
national development financing, including an expanded Bank lending program.
PART II - THE BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BOLIVIA
13.       Bolivia is an original member of the Bank but it did not obtain
Bank Group resources until 1964. Bank Group assistance to Bolivia has been
limited by the country's tight budget and restricted capacity to service
external debt. Until 1975, lending to Bolivia was in the form of IDA credits,
except for a Bank loan to help finance an "enclave" project. Because of the
narrow scope for private investment, the first IFC investment, amounting to
US$400,000 in a cable and plastic products enterprise, was not made until
1973. Annex II contains a summary statement of the status of Bank Group
operations in Bolivia as of January 31, 1976 and notes on the status of
ongoing projects.



14.       The proposed 'Loan would be the Bank's fourth and the fifteenth
Bank Group operation in Bolivia. Net of undisbursed balances, Bolivia's
debt to the Bank and IDA in 1974/75 represented 8.3% of its external public
indebtedness and the share of the Bank Group in total debt service is now
about 4%. Both figures are expected to increase marginally by 1980.
Although the Bank Group has ranked below the US Government and the IDB as a
source of financial ass:istance to Bolivia, its role has been expanding.
15.       Future Bank lending will give emphasis to supporting Government
efforts to expand production while simultaneously improving the distribution
of the benefits of economic growth. Many Bank activities will focus on
helping the less developed regions of the Altiplano and the intermediate
Valleys which contain the majority of Bolivia's rural and urban poor.
16.       The Appraisal Reports for three projects are now under preparation.
One of the projects wil:L be in the water supply and sanitation sector for
small urban and rural areas. Another will provide credits for established
private and predominant'Ly Bolivian owned medium-sized mining enterprises and
private industry. It will operate through a private development bank and
will be the Bank's second operation with that institution. The third will be
with a state-owned mining bank and will provide credits to smaller private
mining enterprises that have thus far had little capital investment. Both
mining projects will result in increased mineral production for export.
17.       In the social sectors, project preparation has also begun for
agricultural projects wiich will be designed to meet the needs of the poorer
farmer and an education project which will seek to improve rural and vocational
education. The financing of further economic infrastructure is also
contemplated in the transportation and power sectors. In transportation,
project preparation is underway for a project to provide access to remote areas
of the country through a program of airport development and continued support
for the railway rehabilitation program is planned as well. In the more
distant future, further Bank programs in agriculture, industry and mining will
be under consideration.
PART I7I - THE POWER SECTOR IN BOLIVIA
Organization
18.       For about forty years, beginning in the mid-twenties, the Bolivian
Power Company, Ltd., (BIC), a subsidiary of the US-controlled Canadian
International Power Compiany, was the sole public service supplier of
electricity in Bolivia, supplying the city of La Paz, the mines around
Oruro and the municipal distribution company at Oruro. A modem power sector
came into being only in the mid-sixties, when the Bolivian Government
established ENDE as an autonomous public utility to build and operate
generation and transmission facilities outside La Paz, and set up the
Direccion Nacional de Electricidad (DINE) to regulate the electricity



- 6 -
industry, including electricity tariffs, throughout the country. In 1968
the Government enacted an Electricity Code, thus laying a uniform basis for
the operation, regulation and expansion of the electricity industry.
19.       ENDE currently accounts for 34% of installed capacity, BPC for
41%, the state-owned mining company (COMIBOL) for 11% and independent
producers for the remaining 14%. In addition to its responsibilities for
the generation and transmission of electricity, ENDE is responsible for
the integration of the various electrical systems and interconnections
with neighboring countries. It is also endowed with the power to form
associated utilities for the distribution of electricity.
Energy Sources
20.       Bolivia is fortunate in having sufficiently ample low cost energy
sources to meet its own current and prospective needs for the foreseeable
future. Natural gas is currently exported to Argentina and a project for
the export of gas to Brazil is under consideration. Bolivia's petroleum
exports also make a major contribution to the balance of payments.
21.       Hydroelectric power meets all of BPC's energy requirements and
64% of ENDE's energy requirements. Natural gas accounts for 90% of the
power sector's total consumption of thermal energy.
Consumption
22.       During the 1969-1974 period electricity consumption grew at 6.1%
annually.  In 1974, per capita consumption was 160 kWh, one of the lowest
consumption figures in South America. The mining industry consumed 44% of
total electric production, the largest consumption of any sector. Residential
consumers accounted for 24% of electric consumption. More than two-thirds
of the general population and about 95% of the agricultural population have
no access to electricity.  The Government is, however, with the financial
assistance of the Spanish and United States Governments, carrying out an
extensive rural electrification program designed to increase the number of
rural inhabitants served by electricity, from 5% to 15% by 1978. Additional
programs are planned through the middle of the coming decade to service the
needs of the rural population. The implementation of these programs will
result in the furnishing of needed power for irrigation pumping systems and
machine operation, thus stimulating the economic development of rural areas.
Tariffs
23.       Electricity tariffs are regulated by DINE in accordance with the
Electricity Code. The Code provides that utilities shall earn a return
averaging 9% on net fixed assets over a three to five year period and that
there should be an annual review of electric rates by DINE. If the return
expected for the three to five year period falls below 8.5% or exceeds 9.5%,
they are required to be adjusted. Although the Code permits the revaluation
of assets to reflect changes in domestic prices, it does not require their



- 7 -
periodic revaluation based on changes in the exchange rate and external
inflation. ENDE has agreed, however, to revalue assets at least once a year
to reflect current values in accordance with methods of revaluation accep-
table to the Bank (Loan Agreement Section 5.04b).
24.       Despite the provisions of the Code, rate increases have in the
past been delayed so that the rate of return has fallen below 9%. La Paz
tariffs, in particular, have been a sensitive political issue and rate
increases have sometimes been inadequate. As a result, needed investments
in the BPC system have had, at times, to be postponed. After extended
negotiations to purchase BPC's assets in 1975, the Government decided that
it would not proceed with the purchase and that it would permit EPC to
continue under private ownership. Shortly after reaching this decision
the Government granted BPC a 70% average rate increase which enabled BPC
to earn 4.7% on its net assets in 1975. BPC has requested additional rate
increases of 30% in 1976 which, if granted, would bring BPC's rate of return
to 9! and permit it to finance with internally generated funds, a large
portion of its needed distribution expansion for the period 1976-1980.
25.       Over the 1972-1974 period ENDE's average rate of return on partially
revalued assets was 8.:L%. Tariffs were increased,in mid-1975, but the rate
of return on fully revalued assets for 1975 was 6%. Prior to loan negotiations,
ENDE fully revalued its assets effective January 1, 1976 and announced a
two stage rate increase of approximately 23%, effective February 1 and May 1
of this year, which wi:Ll bring ENDE's rate of return for 1976 on such net
revalued assets to 9%.
26.       In connection with the third ENDE project (Credit 433-BO), studies
are to be carried out wihich would recommend a tariff structure for Bolivia's
main utilities designed to discourage power consumption during peak hours
and make other suggestions for improving tariff structures. Section 3.03 of
the proposed Guarantee Agreement provides that DINE will review the results
of these studies and discuss their implementation with the Bank. In addition,
the proposed Loan (Section 5.05) and Guarantee (Section 3.02) Agreements
provide that the Borrowrer and the Government will take all steps necessary
to cause ENDE to charge its bulk consumers electricity rates based on demand
and energy charges and thereby discourage wasteful energy consumption during
peak hours.
Future Developments
27.       The UNDP has financed a study now in process which is making an
inventory of national hydroelectric resources and preparing a plan for
power development for the coming decade. Near-term future development
contemplates an expansion of the distribution system in La Paz and its
surrounding areas; additional generation for the La Paz area; inter-
connection between the Northern and Central Systems; and additional thermal
generation in Santa Cruz and Sucre. Parallel with the Bank project, the



- 8 -
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) will lend US$24.5 million to ENDE to
finance generation and transmission works in the Central and Southern Systems
costing about US$30 million. Feasibility studies are also underway for
several large multiple sector projects, which will combine hydroelectric
production, irrigation, agricultural development and water supply.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
28.       The Government of Bolivia has requested a Bank loan to help finance
the expansion of ENDE's generation and transmission facilities. The project
was appraised by a Bank mission which visited Bolivia in September and October
1975. A report, entitled "Appraisal of a Fourth Power Project",, No. 981b-BO,
dated March 14, 1976 is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
Negotiations took place in Washington on March 2 and 3. The Government of
Bolivia was represented by the Sub-Secretary of the Ministry of Energy and
Hydrocarbons, Mr. Jorge Zamora. ENDE was represented by its General Manager,
Mr. Oscar Morales.
ENDE Investment Program
29.       The proposed project is a part of ENDE's overall five year
expansion program for the years 1976-1981. The overall program consists
of a series of investments to expand electric power generation and trans-
mission in the ENDE operating area. 'Mien completely implemented, it will
cost US$141.0 million equivalent, including a foreign exchange component
of US$91.0 million. A portion of the program is underway and is being
financed, in part, through IDA Credit 433-BO. It is anticipated that the
project financed by the IDA credit will be completed early in 1977. The
proposed project, the parallel IDB project referred to above and other
projects costing about US$72.0 million and scheduled for the latter years
of ENDE's investment program, constitute the balance of ENDE's proposed
five year program. The completion of ENDE's five year investment program
is dependent on securing additional external financing of approximately US$ 44
million in the latter three years of the program.
30.       The proposed project consists of the following elements:
(a) expansion of the Santa Isabel hydroelectric power station, including a
third unit (18 MW) and the installation of a secon3 penstock; (b) construction
of a compensating pond with a capacity of 100l,O0Om, to be located at the
Santa Isabel power station intake and to store water from the Corani power
station; (c) collection of water from the two arms of the Vinto River at
a maximum discharge rate of 3m3/second for diversion to the Santa Isabel
tunnel; (d) installation of a gas turbine with a capacity of approximately
22 MW at the Santa Cruz power station; (e) construction of a single circuit
115KV transmission line, 150 km long, between the Sacaba and Vinto substations;



- 9 -
and (f) construction of tlhe Vinto substation, expansion of the Cochabamba
and Sacaba substations and installation of shunt capacitors at the Oruro
substations. A loan and project summary is attached as Annex III.
Project Execution
31.       The project would be executed by ENDE. ENDE was established in
1965 as a limited liabil:ity company. Its capital stock is mainly held by
the Corporacion Boliviana de Fomento (CBF), a Government-owned development
corporation. Ex officio, the Minister of Energy and Hydrocarbons chairs
ENDE's six-man Board, which, in addition to the Minister, consists of three
CBF Directors and one Director each for COMIBOL and YPFB, the Government-owned
mining and petroleum enterprises. The Board appoints the General Manager.
The present General Manager who was appointed in 1972 is an experienced
engineer and competent executive. ENDE's staff of 235, includes 105 pro-
fessionals. The present staff is, in general, competent.
32.       Significant management improvements have been made by ENDE over
the last several years iri establishing financial controls and improving
internal communications amd coordination, as a result, in part, of the
previous DA Credits. The proposed Loan Agreement provides for the
following measures which are designed to encoarage the further improvement
of ENDE's operations:
a. A private consutlting firm is preparing recommendations which
will inter alia assist ENDE in installing a company-wide
budgetary system and improving its fixed asset accounting.
Section 3.07 oi the proposed Loan Agreement provides that
ENDE will prepare a Plan of Action based on the consultant's
recommendation.s and, after consulting with the Bank, carry
out the Plan.
b.   ENDE will prepare a training program and present it to the
Bank for discussion by the end of 1976 (Section 3.06 of the
proposed Loan ALgreement).
33.       ENDE's generating plant is well run and properly maintained.  The
quality of service has been generally acceptable, although voltage regulation
in the Central $ystem shcould be improved.  This problem, should, however,
be corrected as a result of the proposed project.
Project Cost and Financing Plan
34.       The cost of the proposed project is estimated to be US$28.8
million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$20.7 million,
or 72% of total cost. The breakdown of the cost estimate is as. follows:

a) Generating Facilities                 9,298       2,771      12,069
b) Transmission Facilities               5,444       1,653       7,097

Interest During Construction          4,264
Total Financing Required             25,000
35.       The Bank would finance the entire foreign exchange cost of the
project, plus interest during construction on the Bank loan. ENDE would
cover the local costs, principally from internal cash generation.
ENDE's Finances
36.       ENDE's finances have generally been well managed.  At the end of
1974, its total capital and reserves amounted to the equivalent of US$22.3
million, long term debt to the equivalent of US$22.1 million and net current
assets to the equivalent of US$5.7 million. Practically all of ENDEts long
term indebtedness is from IDA, the IDB and USAID and bears interest between
1% and 7-1/4% per annum.
37.       As indicated in paragraph 25 above, ENDE's rate of return in
recent years has been below that provided in the Electricity Code and the
proposed Loan Agreement (Section 5.04) requires ENDE to earn 9% on net
revalued assets in future years. ENDE's improved earnings will enable it
to decrease its dependence on external borrowings to finance its investment
program.
38.       An unfavorable aspect of ENDE's finances has been the accumulation
of accounts receivable in payment for electricity supplied to the Government
public entities and the distribution companies. At the end of 1974 accounts
receivable averaged four months of billings. The proposed Loan and Guarantee
Agreements provide in Section 5.09 and Section 3.02, respectively, that ENDE
and the Government will seek to reduce receivables to three months of
billings in 1976 and two months of billings in 1977.
Procurement and Disbursement
39.       All equipment for the project would be procured, and the contracts
for erection of equipment awarded, through international competitive bidding
in accordance with Bank guidelines. For the purpose of bid comparision,



- 11 -
Bolivian suppliers would be accorded a 15% margin of preference or the
actual customs duty, whichever is lower. The estimated rate of disbursement
is shown in Annex III. ILbout US$300,000 in retroactive financing would be
required to finance the cost of a contract for the design, bid evaluation
and supervision of the Sacaba-Vinto transmission line.
Consulting Services
40.       The project conitains an estimated 255 man-months of consulting
services to assist in procurement matters, the preparation of engineering
drawings and specifications and project supervision. The estimated cost of
these services is $1.3 million, or an average cost per man-month of $5,100.
The employment of consultants would be a condition of effectiveness of the
proposed loan.
Economic Evaluation
41.       The proposed expansion of generation and transmission facilities
which would be financed by the project is justified by the increases in
demand for energy and the growth of economic activity in the three areas
served by ENDE - the Central, Southern and Oriental Sgstems. (See attached
Map.) ENDE's energy sales grew at an annual average rate of 17% between
1967 and 197h. The Central System, with significant mining and moderately
expanding industrial activity, experienced an annual rate of growth in
energy sales in the 1967-1974 period of 13%. The Oriental Systen, an area
experiencing rapid population expansion and dynamic growth in the agricul-
tural, industrial and hydrocarbon sectors had an average annual growth in
energy sales of 29% durin1g the same period. The Southern System, where
ENDE's operations in the city of Sucre did not begin until 1974, had an
increase in energy sales between 1974 and 1975 of 51%. ENDE's sales for
the period 1975-1981 are forecast to increase at an average annual rate of
17.5%. By operating Systems, the forecast average annual increases for the
same period are as follows: Central 13%; Southern 36.5%; and Oriental 17%.
42.       The projections for rapid growth in the ENDE system results, in
part, from the anticipated substitution by commercial and industrial
consumers of ENDE-furnished power for the power that has been previously
supplied by less efficient captive plants. Although the future power needs
of commercial and industrial consumers could be met through captive generation,
rather than by the ENDE system, such a system of development would be wasteful
of the country's resources, since it would result in duplication of investment,
loss of the economy of scale inherent in large-scale generation facilities
and the uneconomic use of fuel. It would also have an adverse impact on the
development of medium and small scale enterprises, for whom captive generation
would be excessively costly. The relatively low cost ENDE-furnished power
should therefore facilitate the development of such enterprises.
43.       An analysis was made comparing the cost of maintaining separate
Central and Southern Systems with the cost of interconnecting the two
systems. It was concluded that the least cost solution for any discount
rate was an interconnection of the two systems. The proposed transmission



- 12 -
lines in the areas to be served would improve the continuity of service,
eliminate supply losses caused by transmission failures and improve voltage
control.
44.       To cover the increase in demand in the Santa Cruz System, the
installation of a third 22MW turbine is the least cost solution. The existing
diesel units in the Santa Cruz plant would be transferred to Sucre in 1976
when the installation of the second gas turbine in Santa Cruz is completed
later this year. This is a lower cost solution than installation of a
smaller gas turbine in Santa Cruz and providing alternate generation for
the Southern Systems.
45.       The rate of return on the proposed project is estimated to be
19%, taking expected revenues as a proxy for benefits and assuming that
ENDE maintains a 9% rate of return on revalued assets. A sensitivity
analysis shows that even assuming a combination of a 10% increase in capital
costs and a drop of 10% in revenue, the rate of return would be 15%.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
46.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and ENDE, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Bolivia and the Bank and the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the
Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
47.       Features of the draft Loan and Guarantee Agreements of special
interest are referred to in paragraphs 23, 26, 32, 37, and 38. An additional
condition of loan effectiveness requiring the employment of engineering
consultants is contained in Section 7.01 of the draft Loan Agreement. In
other respects, the draft Loan and Guarantee Agreements generally conform to
the usual pattern in loans for electric power projects.
48.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
49.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Credit 261-BO - Third Livestock Development Project. US$6.8 million,
June 25, 1971; Effective Date: September 15, 1971; Closing Date: June 30,
1977.
After implementation slowed down in 1974, the project is now
proceeding as scheduled and the credit should be fully disbursed by the
closing date of June 30, 1977.
Credit 346-BO - Railway Project, US$8 million, December 1, 1972; Effective
Date: February 21, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
All of the funds under the project have been committed. Due to
inflation, however, the funds available under the credit have been
insufficient to procure all of the items included in the project. About
50% of the items planned for procurement for the first project, have been
deferred for purchasing under the second railway project. Materials and
equipment ordered under the project did not begin to arrive in Bolivia until
the last quarter of 1974. Improvements have been made in the management
operations, financial condition and tariff structure of the railway.
Credit 433-BO Third ENDE Power Project, US$6 million, October 17, 1973;
Effective Date: December 11, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The project. was initially delayed due to unexpectedly long
delivery time for the gas turbines originally planned to be installed
at Santa Cruz. Project progress is now satisfactory. Cost overruns
are currently at about 34% over the original estimates of project
cost.  ENDE will finance the overruns with its own funds.
Credit 455-B0 - Mining Credit Project, Us$6.2 million, January 18, 1974;
Effective Date: June 18, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The project is proceeding as scheduled.
Credit 561-BO - Agricultural Credit I, US$7.5 million, June 20, 1975;
Effective Date:  December 15, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
