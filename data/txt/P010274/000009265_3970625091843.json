The\n            program contains several elements including (i)\n            macro-economic policies to strengthen the country's\n            budgetary and external finances and maintain a realistic\n            exchange rate; (ii) liberalizing foreign trade and\n            industrial policies; and (iii) reducing and improving the\n            focus of government interventions in the agricultural\n            sector. In addition, the credit supports (iv) commencing the\n            restructuring of public sector enterprises and improving\n            their administration; and (v) improving the administration\n            of development expenditures."}, "docdt": "1987-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
