"Final", "loan_no": "4401", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Judicial Reform Project\n            for Guatemala were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            unsatisfactory; the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate; the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory; and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: Although so\n            obvious as to hardly bear mention, without counterpart\n            buy-in, a judicial or institutional reform effort will not\n            get far. It is the corollary to this statement that is more\n            important, buy-in means not just accepting the donor\n            contributions, but rather internalizing and actively\n            pursuing the change goals behind them. As a corollary to\n            this corollary, it is also important that the Borrower\n            understand and commit to the overall project goals and\n            project development objective (PDO) and component\n            indicators. In one of meetings with the former and current\n            project coordinating unit (PCU) subcoordinators (the\n            official actually in charge of the PCU), the ICR team\n            reviewed the indicators with them and it was evident that\n            there was a lack of clarity on several. Participatory design\n            is good, but can lead to a project 'designed by a\n            committee.' Highly qualified international assistance\n            is also important, especially for countries only starting on\n            the judicial reform route, and thus likely to repeat the\n            errors of the past. If baseline data and other means of\n            tracking performance and project achievements do not exist\n            when a project goes into effect, they need to be created\n            early on. This is critical to establishing concrete\n            performance targets, focusing implementers on achieving\n            them, establishing a monitoring and evaluation system, and\n            allowing the project to demonstrate advances."}, "docdt": "2008-03-10T00:00:00Z"}
