1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Guatemala's population (at the time of project approval 11.2 million) comprises a mosaic
of cultures, ethnicities, languages, socioeconomic realities and geographies. About forty
percent are members of one of 24 linguistically differentiated indigenous groups, each
further retaining, to a greater or lesser extent, its own communal organization, values, and
authority structures.1 As of the late 1990s, sixty percent of the population and the vast
majority of indigenous citizens resided in rural areas. Extreme poverty was (and still is)
concentrated there as well, especially among women. Per capita income was $1,500 in
1997, but Guatemala had the third highest degree of income inequality (exceeded only by
Brazil and Pakistan) among 44 low-to-middle income countries worldwide.2

As the project was being developed, Guatemala was in transition from 36 years of violent
internal conflict, often described as a civil war. The war began in 1960 and formally
ended with the December 1996 signing of the last set of Peace Accords between the
Government and the rebel forces (known as the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unit,
or URNG by their initials in Spanish). The Accords were part of a larger process to
negotiate an end to conflicts in several Central American countries, all of which arose
from disputes among competing political forces, but were fed by severe levels of
inequality within the affected nations. Guatemala's conflict began earlier than the others
and had especially serious consequences for economic growth, social capital and physical
infrastructure. GNP per capital fell by an annual average of 2 percent between 1976 and
1986 and rose by only 0.9 percent annually between 1987 and 1997.

While the war took its toll on all citizens, indigenous groups were particularly affected by
the concentration of fighting and the most brutal human rights abuses in rural areas,
voluntary or involuntary displacement from their communities, and the recruitment of
young men (and some women) by the army or the guerrillas (Hendrix, 2000; Goldman,
2007). The war's termination did not end the social disorder or the animosities it had fed;
in the late 1990s, sixty-nine percent of the population still perceived violence as a major
threat. Violence remains a problem to this day, a product both of the war's disruptions
and a subsequent increase in ordinary and organized crime. At the national level there are
currently 47 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants, second only to Colombia in the region.
The figure rises to 110 per 100,000 in the capital city. (The Economist, September 8,




1 The forty percent figure is taken from the PAD, Annex 2a. However, recent IADB figures (cited in Van
Cott, 2007; 128) show the indigenous population as 60 percent. As both numbers originate in government
statistics, the difference may be due to changes in census methodologies and also a greater tendency of
citizens to identify as indigenous.

2007, p. 40) Violence and citizen security are seen as the most important issues for
Guatemala as evidenced in the presidential campaign of 2007.

Beyond setting a formal end to the conflict, the Peace Accords established a long-term
development plan for the country to restore the rule of law, strengthen the respect for
human rights, and create a more inclusive economic and social system. Sections in the
Accords recognized judicial reform as an important component, reflecting a consensus
among civil society, governmental and political authorities, and members of the justice
sector itself that the sector's reconstruction was essential to promote post-conflict
reconstruction, social stability, and economic growth. The Accords (which, it should be
noted, were not legally binding) also incorporated recognition of traditional forms of
dispute resolution.    Moreover, Guatemala is a signatory to the International Labor
Organization Agreement Number 169 mandating inter alia a respect for indigenous
culture and requiring that indigenous peoples be consulted on any change of legislation
affecting their interests.

Although a 1999 referendum on the constitutionalization of certain aspects of the
Accords (including the recognition of traditional dispute resolution) did not pass, the
1986 constitution, a series of amendments enacted in 2000 and 2001, and infra-
constitutional law did introduce important changes to the justice sector's legal framework.
These included the creation of a Constitutional Court, a Judicial Council and career, a
budgetary earmark for the Judiciary, and the strengthening of human rights guarantees.
A law regulating the council and career was enacted in 1999 (13 years after both were
incorporated in the Constitution), along with a second law establishing a civil service
career for the judiciary's administrative employees. The 1992 passage of a new criminal
procedures code (entering effect in 1994) also promised improvements in the handling of
criminal cases, giving an augmented role to the Public Ministry (prosecution) and a
public defense agency.

Equally importantly, local and donor interest in the theme provided considerable
information on justice system workings, which fed into the Peace Accords commitments
and the present project. As these studies indicated, the most common criticisms of the
courts and the sector as a whole were: lack of public confidence, limited access to formal
state mechanisms and lack of recognition of traditional ones, lack of sensitivity to
customs and traditions of indigenous groups, corruption and politicization, lengthy delays
and large backlogs in the state system, and lack of transparency and predictability in its
outcomes. In a 1997 poll financed during Project preparation (reported in Aragón y
Asociados, 2003) 88 percent of respondents rated court performance as inadequate, 26
percent believed the courts were corrupt, and 79 percent noted the high costs of litigation.
Lack of confidence in the system has produced another highly undesirable side-effect, a
tendency for communities to take the law into their own hands, lynching those suspected
of crimes (Mendoza A, 2007).

During project preparation, a series of workshops with judges (including 32 percent of
the existing bench), indigenous groups, the Commission formed under the Peace Accords
to oversee sector strengthening, NGOs, and other stakeholders emphasized these and



                                            2

other deficiencies. One result was a five-year plan for sector modernization, the judicial
part of which (Comisión de Modernización del Organismo Judicial - UMOJ, 1997)
became the framework within which donor cooperation was to fit. Bank project
preparation financed the drafting of the judicial section and of an associated
implementation plan. As had occurred earlier with El Salvador (whose Peace Accords
were signed in 1992), foreign assistance flooded into the country to support
reconstruction, causing some observers to fear that the justice sector in particular would
not be able to use the possibly $300 million promised by the donor community.3

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The development objective of the project was to create a more effective, accessible and
credible judicial system that would foster public trust and confidence and improve
consistency and equity in the application of law. Key indicators were:

    · Percent increase in user confidence.
    · Percent increase in Judiciary Branch coverage and access outside Guatemala City.
    · Number of corruption related complaints received and resolved through the Anti-
          Corruption Commission.
    · Policy on traditional justice systems developed and tested.
    · Number of subprojects executed through the participation program.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The PDO was not revised. However, starting in mid-2005, the indicators were altered in
the reporting form (ISR 15). Only two PDO indicators were tracked (credibility and
expanded presence of the courts) in subsequent ISRs. There is no evidence that the
indicators were formally changed, and thus, the ICR remains based on those in the PAD.
The three indicators "eliminated" were clearly the weakest and thus no great loss, but as
noted by two reviewers of an early ICR draft, there never was an indicator for efficacy
(except insofar as that might be part of "user confidence"). Developing such an indicator
would, however, have been difficult and costly as the usual candidates are things like
backlog reduction, time to resolution of cases, clearance rates or average workloads, all
of which require accurate and relatively advanced statistical systems or, alternatively,
random sampling of courtroom caseloads. Very few such systems exist anywhere in the
LAC region, and Guatemala's is not among them.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries




3Only about a third of this was offered to the courts, not all of it arrived, and what did come sometimes
took its time. A proposed $30 million EU project for example, only materialized several years later and at
roughly one third the initial amount.




                                                      3

The primary target groups as described in the PAD were "marginalized segments of
society including women, children, small business and other groups in the interior of the
country." It was intended that these groups would benefit from a more effective,
accessible and transparent judicial system and from downstream impacts on promoting
social peace and economic development, strengthening the rule of law and democratic
institutions, improving citizen security, heightening respect for cultural and human rights,
and facilitating the implementation of the Peace Accords. However, all Guatemalan
citizens would also benefit from these developments and especially from their anticipated
impact on reducing violence and encouraging economic growth. Direct if secondary
beneficiaries of the project were members of the judiciary, whose work and working
conditions were to be enhanced by the provision of infrastructure, equipment, training,
and rationalized procedures and processes.

1.5 Original Components (as approved): It bears noting that this project was developed
without a rigorous logframe, possibly because Bank standards were more relaxed at the
time. Thus the descriptions of the components are essentially a list of major activities
(inputs), and these same activities also constitute the indicators of progress. There are a
few output and virtually no outcome or impacts indicators for the components. As
discussed further below, this posed some problems for evaluation of project success. Also,
as the project was designed within the judiciary's larger modernization plan, it was
intended from the start that various donors and the judiciary itself would contribute to
advancing the same goals. This had some impact on how activities were later interpreted
(e.g. the IADB ended up doing most infrastructure construction in the most removed
areas, meaning that the WB focused its three large construction projects in secondary
cities). It also meant that the project was designed, and thus its accomplishments must be
interpreted, in terms of the collective efforts mobilized to advance the plan. As is clear
from the PAD and other early documentation (Aide Memoire, January-February 1998), it
was never intended that the operation advance the PDO on its own, but rather that it
would contribute to a common effort to achieve the larger goals. Among the donor
operations undertaken during the life of the project, the following bear mentioning:

IADB              $25.0 million        Support to sector reform including courts, Public

                                       outlying areas and integrated judicial centers,
                                       combining police, prosecutors, judges, and
                                       defenders. Also provided training, public education,
                                       equipment, and support to the coordinating entity for
                                       sector modernization

                                       staff within them. Also included ADR and
                                       community dispute resolution mechanisms.

                  million              administrative reorganization and reengineering.
Norway            Various grants,      Support to Judiciary, Public Ministry, and
                  $3 million           indigenous defense, including construction of justice
                                       of the peace courts

Union             Euros, currently     school.
                  12 million

The quantities are approximate and are taken from various sources. Data on the Nordic
countries, Spain and the Netherlands only cover activities up to 2003. In the early years,
the UNDP coordinated some donor activities through its PROFED program aimed at
"strengthening the rule of law." Part of this effort, financed by the Swedish assistance
agency, involved the administrative reforms in the judiciary also supported by the WB
project

From 1994 to 2004 the UN also had an observer mission in Guatemala, MINUGUA,
which monitored compliance with the Peace Accords as well as human rights abuses, and
in the justice area, provided, with its own staff, technical assistance to Public Defense, the
Public Ministry, the police, and judicial training. The only operations approximating the
size of that of the World Bank were the IADB multi-sector loan (including police and
prosecution as well as the courts), the two USAID programs, and the promised EU
operation which has only recently materialized after years of negotiations at somewhat
less than its original dimensions.       Although in theory all worked off the sector
modernization plan, it is apparent that donors were guided by what they considered
important, often using items figuring in the plan's long list as a justification, not as a
guide.

1.6 Revised Components

There were no revisions to components. However, as with the PDO indicators, those for
the components were altered in ISR 15 and after. From mid-2005 onwards, only two
outcome indicators were tracked ("consultation, workshop results, user survey results,"
and "formal and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms expanded").               They are
virtually identical to the PDO indicators, and once more there is no explanation or further
documentation of the change. Thus, the ICR's Annex 2 and Data Sheet still work with
the PAD indicators and component activities.           Many of these activities were also
indicators in the initial list and moreover figure in Schedule 2 to the loan agreement.

1.7 Other significant changes

Among the principal changes in the project were the three extensions of its closing date
(to June 2005; December 2006, and June 2007). The major reasons for the extensions
were delays in procurements, and especially in construction projects. Construction in
turn was delayed because of difficulties in acquiring land from the municipalities where
the new courts were to be built, and in the case of the Escuintla center, the discovery that
the land was unsuitable for the planned construction. (Unfortunately, this only occurred
once construction began, as the firm hired directly by the PCU to test the soil had



                                               7

certified its suitability.) This required significant additional investments to prepare the
site and added another year to the time required to complete the project.

A second significant change involved two reallocations of funding among the major cost
categories, with funds moved from consulting services and training to goods and works,
and a final reallocation of funding during the grace period, as shown below:

The first reallocation was done at the request of the Court and justified by the initial
underestimates of the equipment and construction costs. As regards equipment, it also
appears that the Court's own requirements changed, now including the installation of
equipment "in all the courtrooms of the country." The second reallocation again
responded to a request from the Court, and added more monies for equipment (in part
because of the requirements of the new case tracking system, but also to ensure
expenditure of the balance of unused funds) while cutting slightly the works budget from
its previous high.4 Although both requests from the Borrower claimed a lesser need for
technical assistance funds, some activities requiring consultant services undertaken
toward the end of the project were severely under budgeted, causing procurement delays,
cancellation of at least one procurement, and disputes over deliverables. The final
reallocation was in essence a bookkeeping exercise, to move unused funds into the
category of consulting services.

The reallocations also affected the distribution of expenditures among and within project
components. For example, by the end of 2006, the Transparency Component had only
expended $185,000 of the $2.3 million of Bank funds allocated in the PAD, and the
Social Communication subcomponent of Component D accounted for only about one-
tenth of the $3 million initially budgeted. It bears noting that in his March, 2003



4It is worth noting that by the time of the second reallocation, it was evident that one of the departmental
centers would not be built.




                                                      8

communication to the Bank, the UMOJ (PCU) coordinator indicated the need for
adjusting downward the amounts programmed for these components ­ to $1.2 million for
Transparency and $1.5 million for Social Communication. The Bank's response made no
reference to this suggestion.

A third change involved the disappearance of the donor "co-financers" from the
counterpart budget. In 2005, the external auditors stopped mentioning "co-financiers'"
counterpart (which they had never tracked, but only listed as estimated total contributions
over the life of project), and the official counterpart budget was limited to the $3.6
million to be provided by the government. Although the auditors refer to a formal change,
insisting it was introduced to ensure adequate amounts were available for each of the four
components ("con el objetivo de disponer de suficientes fondos en las categorías
correspondientes," Lara, Aranky, Ramos, and Associates, 2006), the ICR team could
find no documentation to this effect (which, we stress, does not mean it does not exist). In
any event, co-financing was always problematic, as except for WB-UNDP cooperation
on a reengineering exercise in 1999-2001, other agencies, even those operating through
or in coordination with UMOJ, programmed and negotiated their operations separately.

There were also slight changes in the implementation arrangements, significant only
because of the problems that underlay them. UMOJ, the project coordinating unit, was
ultimately responsible for project implementation (overseen by a Supreme Court Justice
serving as the project Coordinator). However, responsibility for financial administration
and for large procurement actions had been transferred to UNDP and UNOPs,
respectively, a practice not uncommon in LAC. These arrangements did not change, but
the division of labor among UNDP, UNOPS, and UMOJ experienced some slight
alterations, if not in the formal agreements governing these relationships then in their
interpretation by the parties. Initially UNOPS was to handle infrastructure and equipment
purchases, and large service consultancies, doing all procurement and signing and
managing the contracts. UNDP handled disbursements and payments and was to provide
advice on smaller service contracts, except for those of UMOJ staff (which the UMOJ did
on its own). UNDP did not sign or manage any contracts. However, it could not pay
vendors without UMOJ's prior agreement.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The strengths and weaknesses of preparation, design, and quality at entry are as follows:

Correct choice of PDO, but overly ambitious statement of aims: The three-part PDO
accurately reflects the issues Guatemalan citizens identified as most important (and was
also consistent with the commitments of the Peace Accords). However, in five or even
eight years, substantial advances in all three areas were unlikely. Furthermore, the Peace
Accords marked a symbolic beginning to the process of improved justice and access to
justice, not the end, and any project initiated in the context of post-1996 Guatemala
would require a gradual and cautious program of interventions. While the project could



                                             9

have done more in pressing for outcome improvements, it might have stated its aims
more modestly (and thus not set itself up for failure when judged against its goals). This
was admittedly not part of the WB ethos in earlier years (when such overstatements of
aims were not only allowed, but encouraged) and would have required a more
sophisticated discussion of the necessary change sequence (and thus of the need to
establish an organizational base for future performance improvements) as well as a
greater emphasis on critical steps needed to accomplish it.

Lengthy preparation: While often considered problematic within the WB, this was in
effect an asset and helped the project surmount the challenges of having to start
implementation with a new set of counterparts (the new Supreme Court, see below). The
opportunity to involve significant numbers of stakeholders in the development of a sector
and judicial modernization plan and to develop work plans for activities like the
administrative reengineering (in cooperation with the UNDP's PROFED) created an
impetus and expectations to push initial activities ahead. It was also helpful to have done
the preparation with a project implementation unit that would also take over the
operations and thus was pretty much on board with their contents. Whether intentional or
not, the several-year preparation provides an important lesson to those undertaking
institution building activities in difficult environments; so long as the extra time is used,
as it was here, to expand the operation's constituency by involving them in planning and
diagnostic work, it can pay off with a smoother transition into execution.

Participatory methodology for project preparation and design: This is both a strength
and weakness. During the preparation phase, the Bank (via a PHRD) funded a series of
workshops and other events and the eventual production of the Judiciary's Modernization
Plan (on which the project's content was based). Project documents estimate that roughly
one third of the seated bench and their assistants as well as other local stakeholders and
donors participated in these activities. The consequence was a modernization plan which
reflected the judiciary's own analysis of its needs and problems and also incorporated
perspectives of a wider community of real and potential users. Another grant funded the
development of a detailed implementation scheme for the judicial plan, using the services
of a firm with experience in designing and implementing USAID projects.

The positive side of these practices is that the project's content for the most part
coincided with local perceptions of needs. The weakness is the likelihood that local
perceptions were based on incomplete knowledge and excessive faith in practices which
international experience had already put in question. The World Bank, and other donors,
have still not reached any conclusions as to how to deal with this conundrum, and the
project at most can be criticized for not recognizing the problem and for thus assuming
that local buy-in would guarantee successful achievement of its objectives.

Internal and NGO criticisms of the first WB project in Venezuela5 had already forced
modifications to its initial reliance on infrastructure and equipment to induce institutional
change (Lawyers Committee, 1996). Four years before the PAD was approved, USAID
published a strategic framework (Blair and Hansen, 1994) relegating "institutional
strengthening" composed of training, buildings, and equipment to a last step in its own
programs, following constituency building, legal and structural change, and access
expansion. Nonetheless, Guatemala was no exception to another general rule ­ that when
judges (or for that matter members of any organization) are asked what is needed to
improve their performance, they will generally mention higher salaries, better equipment,
and better facilities (infrastructure). Significantly, one of the last studies financed under
the project (FUNCEDES, 2006) also noted that while Guatemalan judges again cited
infrastructure and equipment as their basic needs, system users complained about
insufficient attention to reducing corruption, delays, and unpredictable judgments.

As this last comment suggests, there are two related problems arising in the participatory
approach as practiced in Guatemala. First, in identifying problems it is better to rely more
on users than on system operators. The latter equate problems with what they don't have;
the former are a more reliable source of information on real performance failings (what
the latter don't do). Second, however well local participants of either type identify
performance failings, they may be less capable of designing solutions. Here more
experienced technical assistance may be useful to ensure that users' problems do not end
up with providers' solutions ­ the former complain about delay or corruption, but faute
de mieux, end up endorsing the latter's suggestion that higher salaries, better equipment,
and modern buildings are the answer. In short, participation is important, but it has its
limits as a guide to project design and is best supplemented with external expertise.                 6



Incorporation of lessons learned: As noted above, the project was prepared after the pre-
approval redesign of the Venezuela operation (to shift infrastructure to the Venezuelan
counterpart contribution), but did not appear to incorporate the lessons learned there or in
earlier USAID projects (Blair and Hansen, 1994). Its preparation coincided with an NGO
report on the Venezuela operation, sharply criticizing the failure to focus on, or take
serious steps to deal with three major problems ­ arbitrariness, corruption and delays ­
and to address the extensive political interference that accounts for them (Lawyers
Committee, 1996). Although the Guatemala PAD does mention delay and corruption,
they, along with political interference, probably did not receive the attention they
deserved in design and implementation. Obviously these are sensitive topics, and the
PAD authors are to be congratulated for even mentioning them at a time when the Bank
was still tip-toeing around the themes. However, at that time, and especially during



5 Venezuela Judicial Infrastructure Development Project (3414-VE), 1992-2003.

6As another example, the Hondurans are still fighting to introduce a Judicial Council that will handle
administrative and governance functions for the courts, despite unsuccessful experience with this model
elsewhere in the region. The Guatemalans are to be congratulated for not taking this route, but it is another
example of why external expertise and experience are important.




                                                   11

implementation (by which point the Bank was on an anti-corruption course) there might
have been ways of ensuring they were more adequately addressed.

The PAD's incorporation of other recommendations from the Venezuela critique (use of
participation and development of a long-term plan) seems to miss the larger point ­
design by committee is only a first stage in a participatory approach, and as the Lawyers
Committee aptly notes, "a comprehensive plan means more than identifying the range of
problems plaguing a judicial system; its real importance lies in developing and
sequencing reform initiatives in a logical progression" (p. 123). The project would also
have benefited from other lessons already emerging in 19987 ­ the inefficacy of ethics
codes in fighting corruption, the need to design training to address problems and not just
a desire to be trained, the difference between access to courts and access to justice, and
the need to push for institutional change on several coordinated fronts. The project did
benefit, even after it went into effect, from the Bank team's familiarity with numerous
innovative practices introduced in other Bank and donor projects, but perhaps overlooked
a more basic lesson that institutional change is slow, that the incorporation of multiple
goals and activities can overextend energies, and that where counterparts do not
internalize the underlying performance goals, projects can simply produce much action
and little improvement. While the preparation team did consult with donors already
working in Guatemala, it is not evident that they used their lessons on the difficulties of
operating in this environment. Longer discussions with USAID and MINUGUA/UNDP
would have usefully identified the political obstacles and institutional weaknesses they
had faced.

Weak links between PDO and activities included in components: The PAD and logframe
did include activities important to advancing the overall objective of promoting more
accessible, efficient, and credible justice. However, these appear as a list of actions to be
taken without any noticeable prioritization, sequencing, or necessary connections among
them. Most of them appear as unusual endeavors, and the PAD does not emphasize any
need to support their continued development once completed.                          In fact, one major
conclusion is that the absence of follow-up in implementation marred the potential for
success in several areas; human resources is a prime example. Some activities only
introduce a study or a restructuring with no further reference to necessary follow-up.
Certain activities as mentioned in the PAD or interpreted by the counterpart, although
receiving considerable emphasis, were clearly less important to the PDO. Examples
include the automation of Antecedentes Penales (issuing the certification of no criminal
record required by those seeking employment) and of the Departamento de Protocolos
(essentially a registry of lawyers, notaries, and documents related to their work). While
both activities were successful (and can be considered quick wins), their impact on the
overall quality of sector performance is minimal. They clearly take second place to
creating a full registry of human resources (more or less complete but only in its payroll



7Worth mentioning here are one WB publication (Hammergren and Messick, 1998); Hammergren, 1998 a
and b; and several works that appeared slightly later but reflected ideas already emerging in the late 1990s.
See for example, Popkin, 2000; Prillaman, 2000; and articles in Méndez et al, 1999.

module) or a functional system for tracking judicial workloads and outputs (still
nonexistent). The PAD resembled a recipe listing all necessary ingredients, but omitting
information as to quantities or order and manner of their incorporation.

Emphasis on input rather than outcome/impact indicators and resultant poor M and E
framework: The indicators are poorly designed and offer little if any means of tracking
performance improvements. As discussed in some detail below, those for the PDO are
difficult to interpret, and if rigorously applied to test project advances, would produce a
very low grade. Nearly all indicators represent either inputs or implementation
benchmarks. This not only posed a problem for the ICR but also seems to have diverted
counterpart attention from the end goals. It tended to encourage an emphasis on
implementing as many actions as possible, with little distinction as to relative importance
or preferred sequencing. As the indicators did not include any measures of judicial
performance (actual delay reduction, number of targeted users attracted to decentralized
units) this also affected the monitoring and evaluation component and may largely
explain the failure to develop one for performance improvement.

Lack of baseline data and failure to prioritize their creation in early stages of project:
During preparation and at project initiation, the Guatemala judiciary lacked reliable
statistics for tracking input, output, or timeliness of decisions.8 Thus, while the PAD
contains references to excessive delays and backlogs and to a general failure to keep up
with rising demand, there was no empirical base for these observations. The problem
might have been addressed by prioritizing, in the PAD and implementation plan, those
activities related to performance tracking so as to provide baseline data for monitoring
and evaluation and as a first step in strengthening institutional capacity. Unfortunately,
few actions were taken in the early years and what is produced in the way of statistics is
still regarded as incomplete and unreliable. One exception may be Guatemala City where
Gestión Penal, the intake center for all criminal cases in the courts there, now tracks (as
the result of a USAID project) all new criminal cases, the stages in their processing, and
their closure. However, interviews in Gestión Penal and in the existing statistical office
did not indicate that the latter used the former's database to supplement or test its own
manual system or to do further analysis of case processing times. (There are also reported
problems with Gestión Penal's statistics, but nothing has been done to identify and
correct them.)

Inadequate attention to structural problems affecting counterpart leadership: While the
PAD makes mention of the risk that the new Supreme Court (entering in November,
1999) might have less commitment to the project goals than its predecessor, it neglects
some important details: the fact that the Supreme Court and entire appellate bench are
fully replaced (with a potential for reelection that is infrequently used) every five years,
and that administrative directors and higher ranking officials lack tenure, serving at the
pleasure of the Court President (changed every year with no chance for reelection). Thus,


8The modernization plan does make reference to a "preliminary" inventory, but it was done only in the
Guatemala courts, and seems never to have been used after that. It was not provided to the ICR team.




                                                 13

the risk and its repercussions were considerably downplayed, as subsequent events bore
out. One further unanticipated consequence was the dominant role assumed by the PCU
in setting policy and the failure to develop judicial bodies that might do so, even within
each court's five-year tenure. In short, while all three Supreme Courts with which the
project worked seemed content with the project, none of them developed real leadership
or ownership nor did they try to encourage the strengthening of administrative offices or
arrangements, apart from the PCU, that might have taken over some broader policy
development functions. One such arrangement might have logically focused on the
Secretaría de Planificación y Desarrollo Institucional; yet, following the reengineering
of the early 2000s, it remained relatively isolated from the project and any further
strengthening of its operations occurred through its own efforts, not as a result of project
interventions.

2.2 Implementation

Frequent changes of key actors on counterpart side: As explained above, this was an
unavoidable but highly predictable consequence of the Guatemalan legal framework, and
it made both judicial and administrative ownership and leadership of the project
problematic. The Supreme Court entering in 1999, soon after the project became effective,
is generally regarded as having had less interest in reform than either its predecessor or
its successor, and as noted in a previous section, it may be largely the impetus created
through the lengthy preparation period that kept it more or less on course. However, in
2003, and despite the recommendations of the mid-term evaluation, this same court
determined it needed little more technical assistance and thus requested a reallocation of
funds to equipment purchases. Beyond their impact on maintaining inter-temporal
agreements and strategies, the frequent turnovers create a number of additional perverse
incentives as regards leaders' willingness to press for difficult changes. For Supreme
Court and appellate justices this would require a highly altruistic approach with little
personal pay-off. Even the Court President, according to knowledgeable observers, has
to use considerable political capital (lobbying the rest of the justices) to push for any
change in standard operating procedures. For administrators it risks angering those who
could push for their removal. Those responsible for oversight and discipline of judges
also noted a "what-goes-around-comes-around" outlook; steps taken against any
individual might cost them considerably when they returned to their ordinary positions
(as judges) or even in their current posts.

Uneven pattern of disbursements and substantive emphasis: This is a likely consequence
of changes in judicial leadership and fluctuations in their own interest in different project
components. As regards new initiatives, the project was most active during preparation
and its early years. This was when the reengineering and restructuring of administrative
offices took place, as well as the provision of equipment and some technical assistance to
many of them. It also saw a potentially useful, if truncated effort to work on speeding up
courtroom processing of cases and the introduction of an Alternative Dispute Resolution
(ADR) program. As most of this was consultant services, disbursements lagged.
Disbursements accelerated in the last years (including a record $10m in 2006), but this
was largely due to the emphasis on completing construction and equipment purchases.
Further attention to improving judicial (courtroom) performance was delayed until the


                                             14

very end, and what was done there (i.e. the case inventory and related study on delay and
its causes) has still not paid off in any concrete impacts.9 Some of it may never be used
owing to the disputes between the contractor and the UMOJ.

Innovative introduction of practices from elsewhere in the region: the Bank TT and the
TTL in particular made good use of examples gleaned from around the region (or the
world) to introduce new initiatives into the project. Although the ICR team, along with
some outside observers (Svensson, 2007), have doubts about their long-term value added,
they did maintain interest in and attention to the project. This should not be discounted,
especially given the usually boring nature of the more classic reform ventures. The
pursue of quick wins as well as publicity for innovations are important tactical additions
to an operation whose normal activities may more often resemble watching grass grow. .

Use of Guatemalan technical assistance: This was a conscious decision by the PCU and
for the most part was a plus for the project. Not all technical assistance came from
Guatemala.       However, of the two major exceptions, the firm developing the case
management software and the organization conducting the inventory and delay reduction
study, the first is considered a success and the second a failure. On the plus side, use of
Guatemalan experts ensured that funds went further, expanded the number of active
stakeholders in the process, and arguably formed a group of local experts able to apply
external disciplines to court processes. One excellent example was the exercise in
accelerating processing times in the appellate courts of Guatemala City. The locally
hired expert did a casebook perfect job, was able to spend sufficient time to ensure
counterpart internalization of the goals and processes, and was later used to teach the
methodology to justices of the peace. Unfortunately, as soon as the process was
completed, the appellate bench was replaced and the new members did not approve the
plan. Project records and interviews with key personnel (including the consultant) do not
indicate whether the recommendations were less formally adopted and if so, whether they
produced the predicted reductions in delays. Those reported by the PCU for the appellate
courts (Novoa, 2006) are based on estimates of time to be saved and some piloted efforts,
not eventual results. The ICR team was unable to get information from the PCU as to any
impact of the seminars with the justices of the peace on real courtroom practices, or in
fact ascertain whether there was any follow-up to encourage adoption of the consultant's
recommendations.

The down side of a reliance on local expertise is the lesser opportunity for adopting
knowledge developed elsewhere. The PCU seemed to recognize this in its use of an
international firm to build the case management software. The experience demonstrates
both the advantages of outside consultants (delivery of a state-of-the-art product,
benefiting from testing in other settings) and the disadvantages (insufficient consultation



9This is largely because the inventory was incomplete and its results inconclusive. However, the
contractor's lack of understanding of or loss of interest in the delay reduction portion meant that what was
delivered has been rejected by UMOJ. It is the ICR team's conclusion that what the contractor was asked
to do would not have provided the necessary information for a complete delay reduction program.




                                                      15

with local users and thus continuing complaints that the end product still lacks certain
capabilities required by local law and organization; these are however being addressed).
The mid-term technical supervision is still another example of the benefits of well chosen
external expertise; comments made by consultants selected for the supervision make it
evident that local empiricism had overlooked some opportunities and problems. Still on a
whole, the policy had mostly positive effects, and the real complaint related to technical
assistance, whatever its source, is the failure to continue to provide it to entities that had
been reorganized and then left to develop on their own. A review of project documents in
IRIS also suggests that while BB funds were used prior to 2003 to bring in international
consultants to work on some of these areas (most notably ADR, see Cornish, 2002 and
Wanis, 2003), the process stopped after that for reasons that remain unclear.

Development of a strong PCU with considerable continuity in its staff. This was a plus
for the project and in large part an explanation of the advances it made. At its height the
PCU had 43-48 staff members (upper number varies according to the source), of whom a
large number were professionals. The quality of implementation was more than
satisfactory at least as regards pushing ahead the majority of procurements outlined in the
PAD. How the PCU continued to keep staff, despite the changes in the larger
administrative system, remains unclear but it experienced relatively less turnover.
Although of much reduced size now, many of the members with whom the ICR team
interacted had been there for some time. Also a few PCU members (the subcoordinator
and one of the informatics specialists, as well as the specialist in judicial education for
civil society, who was, however, first moved to UMOJ from her position in the judicial
communications office) have now moved to the judicial administration. Ideally, more of
this should have occurred.

The downside is the PCU's role in policy planning, selection of activities for emphasis,
and direct implementation of too many. It appears that none of the key staff was
especially concerned with judicial as opposed to administrative performance, which may
explain the lesser attention to factors affecting the former. There also are indications of
the PCU's excessive involvement in activities ­ especially organization of workshops and
short training events and publications ­ that should have been directed by judicial offices
(the Judicial School, the Communications Department, Planning, Finance and so on).
Ideally, the project should have funded these activities, provided technical assistance
where needed to improve quality, but let the relevant offices develop and fit them into
their own programs. Instead, the PCU was even accused of further weakening operating
units by hiring key staff (Moore, 2007). This hypothesized over-involvement of the PCU
deserves more attention; in the time allocated for fieldwork, the ICR team could not
explore it sufficiently. It bears noting, nonetheless, that of the $5.2 million of Bank
financing initially allocated to component D (Communications, Support for
Modernization Commission and PCU), by the end of 2006, $3.9 million had gone to
"strengthening the PCU," and that the other two items had received $350,700 and
$320,800 each.

Failure of counterpart to act on, or WB to press for implementation of recommendations
in the mid-term evaluation:      The mid-term supervision, conducted in October 2002



                                             16

contains a long list of excellent recommendations as regards the initiation of neglected
activities, follow-through on others, establishment of a monitoring and evaluation system,
and certain adjustments to most project components. The ICR team was unable to go over
the recommendations in detail with PCU staff, but its review of the project timeline and
subsequent activities, suggests that many recommendations were not taken and others
were acted on only toward the end of the project. Significantly, despite the need for
additional technical assistance and training implicit in the recommendations, the first
reallocation, shifting funds from these two categories to goods and works, followed
shortly. Clearly this was the Court's preference; the question is how or whether the PCU
or the WB could have convinced it otherwise.

Coordination with other donors: There was a good deal of coordination realized through
the PCU, especially because of its management of IADB resources and agreements to
coordinate infrastructure with other donors implementing their programs separately.
While overall placement of new facilities was sometimes less than rationale, this at least
avoided duplication of efforts.    Other good examples of PCU-initiated coordination
include the combined efforts of the WB and PROFED projects in the 2000 reengineering
exercise. Still, coordination could have been much better, especially with donors that did
not work through the PCU. Both the new EU operation and the on-going USAID projects
are two examples, and relationships of the latter with the PCU seemed to be especially
volatile. Whether coordinating formally or not, donors often promoted different and not
entirely compatible models for the activities they financed (see Carothers, 1999, p 15,
specifically on earlier experience in Guatemala).          The Dirección de Servicios
Tribunalicios, (intake center for new cases and also responsible for notification services)
in Guatemala City had its civil side assisted by the Spanish aid agency, and its criminal
side by USAID, resulting in two separate sets of practices and procedures. USAID also
supported development of software for case registration, leading to some conflicts
(apparently now resolved) with the WB financed case-management software. Moreover,
USAID recently (October 2, 2007) presented a model for reorganizing first instance and
peace criminal courts that appears not to match the assumptions underlying the WB
software design and is also inconsistent with an early model developed, but not
implemented, by the WB project.

Coordination among judicial branch offices and between them and the PCU:
Coordination here was even less notable, and seemed to have slacked off once the initial
restructuring and reengineering activities were completed (by the early 2000s). The ICR
team found several examples of redundant practices within the administration (for
example four offices collecting their own judicial statistics), failures to use or even be
aware of the potential to combine forces or utilize each other's databases, and lack of
knowledge of relevant studies done by the PCU (for example the case inventory which
should have interested several offices). Various administrators interviewed referred to
their lack of knowledge of what the PCU was doing (Moore, 2007). For a project that
placed an early emphasis on administrative restructuring and rationalization, this is not a
good sign.




                                             17

Failure to implement key studies early enough to utilize them in the project: Because the
project was only intended to last for five years, it may have made sense to limit some
activities to conducting studies. Still even within the initial timeframe, had these studies
(on traditional law, on delay, on human resources, the case inventory) been initiated early
on, they could have had an impact on the design and implementation of related activities.

Failure to follow-up on early activities so as to encourage further progress: As suggested
above, and partly as a consequence of the initial short timeframe for the project, the PAD
rarely mentioned any follow-up on restructurings, studies, or activities (delay reduction
exercises) intended to improve administrative and judicial performance. As a result, such
follow-up rarely occurred, meaning that pilot efforts were not replicated, restructurings
were never tested and readjusted, and continuing assistance to reengineered entities was
rare (Moore, 2007). In some cases this was critical because the initial activities needed
readjustment; in others it was equally necessary because more assistance would have
helped them perform their new tasks. As one example, while the project supported the
creation and equipping of the Consejo de la Carrera Judicial and its various units, the
ICR team found no record of further attention to improving their operations. This
attention is vital as they are experiencing many problems, ranging from still inadequate
equipment (e.g. vehicles) to legal and methodological constraints.         A second clear
example was the failure to provide appropriate training for the Director of Human
Resources. Another, already cited above, involved the exercise on reducing courtroom
delays conducted by a local consultant with appellate and justice of the peace courts.
Although the 3 volume report was provided to the PCU, the latter could not provide
evidence of even informal adoption of his suggestions. Finally, PROFED (UNDP) during
the 1999-2001 reengineering worked on improving the internal organization of family
courts, using two pilot courts in Guatemala City. However, this activity also lacked
follow-up.

Excessive reliance on a new case management software to fix the problems not resolved
earlier: As regards many of the criticisms made above (lack of attention to delay
reduction, failure to follow up on exercises to facilitate courtroom processing of cases),
UMOJ now holds that replication of the new management software will provide the
answer. Judging by comments made as early as 1996 (Lawyers Committee), the lessons
of other projects, and Microsoft's own experts (Roberto Adelardi De Diego, in
presentation to V Seminario Internacional de Gestión Judicial, Lima, October 10-11,
2007), this faith is misplaced. The software is an important tool and can save judges and
their staff time, but it cannot overcome problems originating in legal obstacles,
procedural inefficiency, leadership's failure to monitor and resolve performance
weaknesses, or parties' efforts to increase delays and exert irregular influences on judges
and staff. Ideally, most of these problems should be addressed before the software roll-
out. The expectation that the software will make that unnecessary raises two additional
risks: that the software will incorporate them in its own design and that it will further
postpone any effort to resolve them.

Use of UNOPS to manage infrastructure and equipment contracts: As regards equipment
purchases, there were no problems reported, but in the case of infrastructure, problems



                                             18

and conflicts were frequent. Neither the PCU nor UNOPS regards the arrangement as
satisfactory, and both have suggested that it be discontinued. Whatever the immediate
source of the problems, their resolution has been impeded by the contract designs, which
give UNOPS responsibility for the contract, but UMOJ the final determination as to
whether the products are satisfactory and what payments will be made. (However, this
detail is not reflected in the contracts signed by UNOPS with the construction firms).
Negative results included delays in finishing projects, cost overruns (which in a few cases
UNOPS had to pay), and dissatisfaction with the final results.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

There really was no monitoring and evaluation system for this project; what existed
focused almost exclusively on tracking the delivery of inputs, disbursements, and
payments. At least through 2001 (UMOJ, 1999, 2000, 2001a),10 the PCU provided
annual reports tracking progress in the "outcome" indicators for the project. However,
estimates of completion of activities seem somewhat questionable.11 No system was
established to measure the impact of individual activities in improving access, efficiency,
and credibility. As support for this statement, readers are referred to the 2006 table on
CAS inputs (N.A. 2006) prepared by a consultant and in which many of the boxes listing
PDO and component indicators are left blank, or reported as "in progress." For others,
the author seems to have taken a fairly liberal interpretation of what they represented.
The ICR team asked the PCU to update the chart, but is still awaiting the response. The
several activities that were intended to set baseline data and measure progress were either
done late or not at all. The last user survey was not done, and what was substituted does
not allow comparison with the earlier two surveys. Failure to implement a reliable
judicial statistics system means that efficacy could not be measured, and measures of
access are limited to the number of new courts and judgeships created. The external
consultant (Novoa, 2006) hired by UMOJ to collect information as an input to the ICR
was unable to find good indicators of impacts and from what was available largely
concluded, as does this ICR, that except for physical access, impact on system
performance appears minimal.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The team reviewed a sample of the financial and procurement post reviews as well as all
the external audits, none of which reported significant problems.                       Those that were
reported have been or are being resolved. The PCU adopted an automated system to
track its expenses; unfortunately this was not the one used by the judiciary's budget
office (SIAF) and thus information supplied to the latter on the project is entered into the
judicial system only as aggregate expenditures (Moore, 2007).


10These were the only reports provided by UMOJ.

11For example, there is the question of how the percentage of participatory activities completed could be
calculated when no target number was ever set.

One issue not noted until after project closure involves the inadequacy of the contractual
arrangements among the UMOJ, UNDP, UNOPS, and the contractors the latter managed.
Aside from, but perhaps contributing to, the increasingly difficult relationships among the
parties, the "nest of contracts" was poorly designed, leaving UNOPS wholly responsible
for a contract but allowing UMOJ the final say as to whether the contractor complied
with requirements (final say, because UMOJ authorizes UNDP to make the payments). It
should also be noted that UMOJ has had problems with contracts it has managed on its
own, and that its tendency to reject products with little indication of the necessary
improvements, or to provide what the contractors described as insufficient support for
their activities, should be addressed. The project is ending with two contract disputes
totaling roughly $150,00 each and the grace period is being extended for two additional
months in the hopes that some definitive resolution can be reached. As none of the
parties seems inclined to repeat the former arrangements in a new project, UMOJ will
probably manage contracts on its own, but to do that satisfactorily it will need to improve
its manner of handling disputes over deliverables. Based on reports from the affected
contractors, it also appears that they (and UNOPS) erred in not documenting their
purported agreements to certain changes. If this is true, UMOJ may benefit from their
oversights, but in the future, it will be important for UMOJ to insist on the documentation
of any such changes so as to avoid any repetition of these conflicts. These and other
contractors also complained about the poor quality of the UMOJ terms of reference, and
continuing disputes (generally won by UMOJ, but only because it had the final say) as to
what they really meant. The complaints were frequent enough to suggest a real problem
and the need to address it in any future project.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

At the writing of the ICR, the project was still operating in its grace period. Operation
and maintenance of constructions and equipment have been assumed by the judiciary.
The ICR team did receive some complaints on equipment maintenance during its
interviews ­ a few administrative and judicial staff members noted they had been without
functioning equipment for some time. The WB intends a follow-on project scheduled for
board approval in July, 2008. In the meantime the IADB has finished negotiating a new
loan with the sector, of which a portion will again be managed by UMOJ.                 It is
anticipated that the IADB loan will take over financing of the latter at least until the WB
project comes on line. The two banks and the judiciary will then have to decide how its
funding will be handled. The initial WB plan was for a repeater project, with board
approval in December, 2007. It appears that the plan has changed, not only as involves
the dates, but also as involves the content of the operation, which will be a follow-on, not
a repeater. The CMU has expressed to the judiciary its lesser interest in financing
infrastructure, and its interest in financing equipment only as it contributes to the
furtherance of the institutional change and performance improvement agenda. It is thus
envisioned that the next operation will focus on using the organizational base created by
its predecessor to push forward the PDO by further strengthening judicial oversight,
planning, and implementation capacity as regards administrative and judicial operations,
advancing the adoption and use of the case management software, encouraging steps to
break down the barriers to access apart from physical proximity of services, and
improving the entire human resource management system. With regard to any future


                                              20

project implementation unit, it is imperative that the Bank encourage greater integration
with existing administrative and judicial units, and in particular with the Secretaría de
Planificación y Desarrollo Institucional.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

As a preface to this discussion, a short note on "attribution" seems necessary. We know
this is stressed by IEG, and we understand its significance. However, we emphasize that
in an institutional development project, and especially one where many donors, not to
mention the national government, are operating simultaneously, attribution of outcomes
is extremely difficult, if not impossible to determine.        Projects are not controlled
experiments and the key question ­ would things have occurred without the project? ­
can rarely be answered. There are exceptions ­ especially as regards inputs (where a
project did something no one else was supporting) ­ but outcomes and impacts are
another matter. What a project usually does is increase the chances of changes in the
quality of organizational performance, and even there attribution is an inference, not a
quantifiable fact. In any event, in the present project, the evaluation is working in one of
the more difficult contexts ­ many donors and local agencies working on similar
activities, poor records and memories as to who did what, and many shared endeavors, in
a highly volatile and difficult national environment.         Since the WB project was
supporting a PCU that also managed IADB funds and coordinated with several other
donors, there is the additional question of how much credit should go for actions financed
by others through this process. (While one could give the WB credit for the IADB
activities the PCU managed, it strikes us that absent the WB, the IADB would doubtless
have paid for its own PCU ­ hence attribution of IADB results is a bit of a stretch.)

In dealing with the issue of attribution, the ICR team has followed a logic based more on
common sense than anything more scientific. Thus, while the project's presence may
have marginally increased the chances of certain key legislation (e.g. the career law)
being enacted, we are not giving it credit there. It does however get credit for what it did
to strengthen the agencies that applied the law and to provide the equipment and
infrastructure they required to do so ­ and is criticized for what it did not do, did too late,
or initiated without sufficient follow-up.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The PDO ­ creating a more efficient, accessible, and credible judicial system ­ was and
remains highly relevant to national, global, and Bank assistance strategies. Improving the
justice system and increasing its accessibility to indigenous citizens were highlighted in
the Peace Accords and the overall development plan they included for the post-conflict
period. Improving access to justice and the quality of that delivered has only increased
importance as a global priority over the past decade. The project and its PDO were fully
consistent with the CAS emphasis on advancing the post-war social reconstruction
process and modernizing the public sector. Moreover the CAS (18036-GU) in effect at
the time of project preparation and appraisal specifically emphasizes judicial reform as
part of its support to the Peace Accord commitments.



                                              21

Project design was another matter. This point and those on implementation have been
mentioned in other sections of this ICR, but they are summarized here and referred to
where otherwise critical. Project design evinced four major flaws:

    · The components lack adequate definitions, never rising above a collection of
        activities presumed to advance some common objective, and conflate lines of
        action (e.g. strengthening of administrative systems and of judicial performance)
        that might better be treated separately.
    · Indicators are poorly chosen, inadequately defined, and in a majority of cases
        refer to inputs not outcomes or impacts. In several cases, their interpretation is
        ambiguous (e.g. what value to assign to the number of complaints about
        corruption registered, or to the percentage investigated and processed).
    · The causal linkages between activities within each component and the
        development objectives are not sufficiently clear. This is "the recipe without the
        quantities or order and manner of incorporation."
    · While project preparation included preparation of a Gantt chart, detailing the
        intended order of implementation down to the week or day, the chart had little
        impact on the order in which activities were initiated and completed. In the end
        the Gantt chart was overly-complex; it would have been better to develop a less
        detailed plan emphasizing prioritization and sequencing of lines of action (along
        the lines recommended by the Lawyers Committee in 1996).

As a consequence, implementation appears to have followed a path determined by the
PCU's strengths and perspectives, altered only by last minute efforts to attend to areas
ignored until that time and to spend remaining funds. Activities that should logically
have been initiated early on (a nation-wide inventory of cases, development of a reliable
statistical system for tracking court performance, development of a human resources
program to rationalize assignment and retraining of personnel) came relatively late, and
several key activities (development of programs for delay reduction, the judicial
information system, and of standards for managing caseloads) are now deemed dependent
on the installation of a sophisticated case management software. As software design was
only completed in mid-2006, and the system has so far been implemented in only 32 trial
courts, it probably will not provide these results for several more years. Moreover
activities initiated and completed early on have usually not received any follow-up ­ and
to the extent they have prospered seem to have done so on the basis of the talents of the
officials in charge. Noteworthy here are the unit within the Judicial Council responsible
for evaluating judges, the budget office, the planning office, the human resource office,
and Servicios Tribunalicios, responsible for receiving, assigning, and tracking new cases,
managing an archive of active criminal case files, and running the notification services
for all Guatemala City courts. All of these departments received some initial assistance
(especially during the reengineering exercise of 2000) and equipment, but by their own
reports, had little further contact with the project or the PCU.

It is worth noting that the mid-term supervision (World Bank, 2002) called attention to
the problem of follow-up and of the areas still not touched, but it does not appear that its
recommendations had much impact. This is especially true as regards those relating to:



                                               22

    · Further changes in the management of administrative staff ­ development of
        profiles and their use to reassign, retrain, or encourage voluntary retirements of
        staff not fitting the profile.
    · Integration of the PCU's activities with those of the judiciary's existing
        administrative structure to advance internalization of the program, its methods,
        and its goals.
    · Evaluations of the Department of Human Resources, Judicial School, ADR
        program, and of the training sponsored by the project.
    · Development of a judicial statistics system and implementation of the various
        activities intended to produce it.
    · Realization of the study on "particularidades" of rural and urban communities
        (only completed in late 2006).
    · Realization of the studies and activities associated in the PAD with the civil
        society participation program.
    · Development of a system of monitoring and control of the Judicial Modernization
        Program.

While recognizing the many advances made under the program, we believe project
design impeded further progress toward achievement of the PDO; allowing
implementation of an arguably excessive number of activities and placing insufficient
attention on the need for follow-up of actions initially completed. Indicators stressing
outcomes and impacts rather than inputs might have encouraged better implementation
practices and a longer term emphasis on producing real improvements in performance.
As none of the evaluation team is extensively familiar with Bank projects developed in
the late 1990s, they recognize that they may be setting the bar too high and have tried to
take this into account in later rating sections. However, regardless of how this specific
project is or should be graded, the point is that these are the standards against which
contemporary judicial reform or any institutional development efforts should now be
judged and in terms of which they should be designed.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The achievement of the PDO ­ creation of more effective, accessible, and credible
judicial system performance ­ is rated as moderately unsatisfactory. This rating is based
less on visible improvements in the three areas than on the progress in putting in place
elements that might, over the longer run, allow their achievement. However, of the five
initial performance indicators, only one (which remained post-2005), "percent increase in
Judiciary Branch coverage and access outside Guatemala City" ­ can be considered as
adequately met and it is the result of the collective efforts of many donors and of the
government (Organismo Judicial, 2005). Even so, much depends on how one interprets
access. The project, and related donor activities, some of them implemented by the same
PCU, indisputably augmented physical access to court and related services throughout
Guatemala by constructing and equipping new justice of the peace courts, departmental
and regional centers, and mediation offices throughout the country, and initiating a
program of mobile courtrooms (so far only in Guatemala City and Quetzaltenango).



                                             23

Moreover, the judiciary ensured that these facilities were staffed, and there was a serious,
if not fully successful effort, to ensure judges and staff were fluent in local languages
and/or were provided with interpreters Still, as almost every knowledgeable observer of
the project and the court's broader modernization program has noted, access to courts is
not the same as access to justice, and the latter depends both on attacking other barriers
(including costs, lack of confidence, and insufficient familiarity with services) and on
raising the quality of the services provided.

Of the other PDO indicators, the most relevant to the question of quality is the "percent
increase in user confidence." This indicator also remained after 2005. The project funded
two nation-wide surveys in 1997 and 2003. Like other opinion polls conducted over this
period (CEJA, 2003, and 2005), they indicate no significant change in the initial low
levels of confidence, although they do show that all citizens, and rural citizens in
particular, perceived justice as less costly by 2003 (Aragón y Asociados, 2003).
Unfortunately, a final complementary survey scheduled to coincide with the project's end
was not conducted.12 Instead two consultants interviewed court staff, lawyers, and
community authorities in the central districts of Guatemala City, Quetzaltenango,
Huehuetenango, Escuintla, and El Petén. As they note, open ended interviews brought
little mention of improvements, but when interviewees were asked specific questions,
they did note some advances in such things as infrastructure, number of courtrooms,
automation, training of judges and staff, and attention to violence against women.
However, in areas like attention to the public, delays, transparency and accountability the
great majority saw no improvement or even some worsening of the situation. Another
survey done in 2006 (FUNCEDES) and tapping reactions of inhabitants of rural
communities, found respondents complaining about a lack of progress on delays,
corruption, and attention to users. As neither of the last surveys is directly comparable to
those done earlier, the best that can be said is that the results on this indicator are
inconclusive.

Unfortunately, the third indicator (dropped in the last ISRs) ­ number of corruption
related complaints received and resolved through the Anti-corruption Commission ­ is
poorly stated. The Commission (which was formed after the project began) does not
receive or investigate complaints, but instead operates as a coordination and policy-
recommendation body for the various organizations in the justice sector. It was supposed
to monitor complaints received by other bodies, and their follow-up, but so far has not
taken up this task. Given that the misstatement was probably unavoidable, a substitute
indicator ­ complaints heard and resolved by the judiciary's civil service and judicial
disciplinary boards can be used.

12 PCU staff explained that this was not done because of the timing of national elections and the likelihood
that the results would be prejudiced by the political environment. As the elections were held in September,
2007, the explanation is not entirely convincing ­ surveys could have been done a year earlier.

*Own elaboration with data from Novoa (2006) based on statistics from Human Resource Department and
Junta de Disciplina. Note that Juntas de Disciplina change mid-year. Thus the date given is for the end of
the period in which each junta operates.

Interpretation of the figures is difficult and the PAD gives no indication of what was
intended. The fact that there is a disciplinary system and that it is being used is important,
but how well it is working and with what results on performance are impossible to
evaluate. In interviews we listened to many complaints about the fairness and accuracy
of the system, and it also is apparent (as demonstrated by the number of admitted
complaints, especially against judges, with no further processing) that there are many
logistical problems especially as regards complainants, defendants, and witnesses located
outside of the capital city.

The fourth indicator (also dropped in mid-2005) ­ policy on traditional justice systems
developed and tested ­ shows no concrete progress, and is also an area where the
project's activities were minimal. A key study, on the "particular needs of rural and
urban populations" was only finished in 2006, and moreover did not assess traditional
mechanisms in any but the most superficial fashion (FUNCEDES, 2006 which only lists
"nonjudicial authorities," without explaining how they operate, and briefly discusses the
conflicts usually referred to each and any interactions with the formal system) for the 33
communities it surveys. It does not directly address the question of how to incorporate
them. The PCU's answer to questions about advances here was to emphasize the role of
justices of the peace, of alternative dispute resolution, and of community courts.
However, the development of a policy arguably was outside the areas the project could
realistically tackle ­ depending on political authorities and political discussions at other




                                                    25

levels.13 Thus, while the project made little or no progress here, the fault largely lies with
an unrealistic setting of goals.

As regards the fifth indicator (dropped mid-2005) ­ number of subprojects executed
through the participation program ­ neither the evaluators nor the PCU staff was able to
determine what was intended. In the PAD, the civil society participation program is
described as encompassing "subprojects (totaling up to $50,000 for each one) through the
promotion of partnerships with donors, non-governmental organizations and other
participants, for developing broader public participation in access to justice programs
such as free legal assistance for the poor, access to justice for young people and women,
analysis of costs of litigation, and other related activities that will promote social
reconstruction and trust in post war conflict areas." This suggests the initial intent was
the creation of a small grants program, like that introduced in the World Bank Ecuador
judicial reform operation. However, the mid-term evaluation equated advances in this
indicator with centrally organized workshops on cultural sensitization of judicial
operators (of which 14 had been held by October, 2002) and to prevent lynchings (in
which 600 community leaders participated) as well as with a second stage program on the
latter theme intended to involve mayors and justices of the peace. An UMOJ (2003)
publication on citizen participation stresses other, centrally financed and directed
activities ­ two programs with school children, various publications, and the mobile
courtrooms. In the evaluation team's meetings with the PCU, none of the latter activities
was mentioned. In any event, and whatever is officially included here, the indicator, like
the previous one, does not measure impacts nor suggest how to interpret the results (See
also Novoa, 2006 on this point). Absent further information, advances on this indicator
must be considered as unmet.

On the basis of a review of the five indicators (or even the two retained in the post-2005
ISRs), a grade of moderately unsatisfactory might be considered as too high. However,
we believe the problem is less with the project's advances than with its design. The PDO
indicators were poorly selected, poorly explained, and to some extent, never really
understood by the counterpart ­ not to mention by the evaluation team. Giving them
equal importance in grading the PDO achievement, while technically defensible, thus
strikes us as an unacceptable formula for evaluating progress. Instead, we briefly review
the three elements of the PDO, their relationship to elements of the four components, and
indicators (taken from other sources) of measurable advances.                        A more detailed
discussion of each component and progress on its indicators is included in Annex II.

Access Improved, Especially for Marginalized Groups:




13This point is also made in ASIES (2007; 72) in reaction to a new Supreme Court proposal to promote
work in this area. Moreover, and in seeming contradiction to constitutional provisions and the official (if
unimplemented) government policy, the Court suggested it would go forward with a study on the
desirability of recognizing indigenous law.

Less discussion is included here, as much of this is covered above. Over the project life,
it is indisputable that physical access to courts greatly increased. There are now 365
justices of the peace as opposed to 229 in 1997, and at least one located in every
municipality; 70 mediation centers; and two mobile courtrooms with 10 more ready to
deploy. This cannot be attributed only to the World Bank, but it directly contributed with
the construction of 6 justice of the peace courts in Petén, one of the departments with
least services, the remodeling of 11 others, the mobile courtrooms, the construction of 16
mediation centers in the interior and the central office in Guatemala, and the construction
of one departmental and two regional centers. While the three justice centers are located
in (or near, Escuintla) secondary cities, they are intended to provide more and better
access to people there and to encourage the decentralization of system administration to
the department and regional level, thereby contributing, if indirectly, to improved judicial
performance. The project also equipped what it constructed or remodeled, and provided
equipment to other facilities, to ensure staff had the resources necessary to do their jobs.

Questions about the quality of justice (which also impact access defined more broadly)
are addressed in the next sections. Here it should be stressed that the project sponsored
other activities to improve access in this broader sense. These include numerous
workshops to sensitize judges and staff to the needs of indigenous populations, 14
publication of material in indigenous languages, and the hiring/training of interpreters.
We know these activities occurred, but absent any effort to evaluate impact, cannot
attempt to assess what it was. Much the same can be said about the proliferation,
sponsored by the Bank, other donors, and the judiciary itself, of courtrooms and judges.
Statistics on ADR services exist, and except in more populated areas, they appear
underutilized, suggesting the need for more work on user needs and how to meet them
more adequately, the reasons for non-use and follow-up to determine whether agreements
are respected by the parties.15 Despite not entirely overwhelming workloads, those in
urban centers are beginning to complain about congestion, indicating the need for
attention to their own management systems and prioritization of cases.

The judiciary has made some effort to employ more staff and judges fluent in indigenous
languages (although predominantly in the mediation centers, not always as part of a
systematic plan, and sometimes still not trusted by local inhabitants). The extent of the
WB contribution to this policy is unclear. As of April 2006 (ASIES, 2006; 69) there
were 749 judicial personnel fluent in indigenous languages, but of these only 56 were
judges, and 33 interpreters.           (There were 10 additional interpreters but their other
language was not an indigenous one). A further problem is that the locations where



14We are tempted to say "countless" as the list provided by UMOJ defies quantification, but adequately
demonstrates that considerable training was done.

15Statistics supplied by the central ADR office for several months in 2007 indicate that the 70 centers
process an average of about 10 cases monthly, although some do as many as 30 mediations. The center
keeps fairly good statistics and does some basic analysis ­ however, it seems to have not yet developed a
policy to respond to the apparently insufficient demand (even in the busiest centers).




                                                    27

bilingual judges and support staff are most needed are also the least desirable for those
hoping to advance in their careers.       Thus, there is a reported frequent rotation of
individuals initially assigned there, and in any event we received no information on
where these bilingual personnel were located. Finally, while sensitization courses and
multi-lingual publications exist, their utility in resolving the problem deserves
questioning ­ the courses because training, absent incentives to apply it, is notoriously
ineffectual, and the publications because of the high levels of illiteracy especially among
indigenous groups. Nonetheless, project efforts served to keep the theme alive whatever
their direct impacts on fixing the problem.

Access or the potential for access has clearly improved over the last 10 years, but there is
still a long way to go. The World Bank project has played a part in the process, but
without more research, it is impossible to say 1) how much and 2) whether it could have
done more. We believe the answer to the second, and intrinsically more important
question is probably "yes" and that the failure to work on items related to the indigenous
issues is one indication. Still further progress on the access variable could have been
facilitated by advances on the other two, both of which involve the quality of justice
delivered and thus affect citizens' inclination to use the services now more physically
accessible.

Efficacy of Judicial Services Improved

The project, as interpreted by UMOJ and the Judicial Branch, addressed this issue
through a focus on improving the structure, resources, and operating procedures of three
main parts of the judicial organization:

    · The system-wide administrative apparatus, whose more efficient workings would
        provide better support to the courts and rationalize resource use
    · What the judiciary considers "auxiliary offices," units responsible for oversight,
        discipline and training of judges and for helping them process their cases through
        the provision of services like intake, notification, and temporary archiving of case
        files
    · The judicial offices themselves and the personnel working in them (both judges
        and support staff)

While indicators could be developed to assess improvements in each one, they were not
introduced (and for the first two subsystems pose certain conceptual difficulties). The
indicators most commonly used for overall institutional efficacy (and for judicial offices
alone), delay and clearance and congestion rates, were not tracked either, although as
discussed in the final part of this section, what evidence exists does not suggest great
advances. However, such changes take time, and depend on a good strategy. Thus,
before reviewing overall results, activities and progress in each of the three types of
strengthening are examined.

Attention to administrative and auxiliary offices came first, beginning as a restructuring
effort even before the project went into effect. Most changes were effected in 1999,



                                             28

although there were further readjustments as documented in Novoa (2006). Some of
these seem to be purely arbitrary and not all were improvements. A major problem not
resolved by any of the restructurings, was the placement of the auxiliary offices (which in
all versions continued to report independently to the President of the Court) and
coordination of their activities (Louza, 2007).

A second stage began in 2000, combining the efforts of UNDP (through its PROFED and
financing from a variety of donors) and the WB/UMOJ. This emphasized reengineering
of internal processes, the development of manuals, and the equipping and some
remodeling of the restructured agencies. At that point the process, except for the design
of a series of software programs for several of the administrative agencies, stopped, and
therein lies the major flaw. From then on, most offices either stayed as they were or
developed on their own, with no more technical assistance, and little communication with
the others. ICR consultants also observed (Moore, 2007) that manuals were not used, had
not been updated, and appeared in several cases, not to exist. The results are a
rationalized structure, but one in which the internal operations of the parts and their
ability to coordinate with each other are still inadequate.        Some offices (Servicios
Tribunalicios) have advanced because of assistance from other donors (most notably
USAID for the Gestión Penal section). Others advanced on their own, but slowly and
without benefit of national or international technical assistance that might have
accelerated the process. There are evident problems, which the members of the agencies
noted to us, but seemingly have no power to overcome. For example:

    · The statistics office has moved back and forth between Planning and CENADOJ
       (an automated document service). It arguably belongs with the former which
       should be a primary user of its output and which might be better able to insist on
       the provision of adequate statistics from individual courtrooms and to force
       improvements in a very rudimentary system with such unreliable results that
       CENADOJ has so far only published those for criminal justice corresponding to
       2002 (Louza, 2007; Moore, 2007). Instead Planning tries to collect its own
       statistics on workflow (used to help decide where additional judges and auxiliary
       staff are needed), but lacking technical assistance, tends to organize them
       chaotically ­ much double or triple recording of the same action, and a failure to
       distinguish between those initiated by the parties and by the judge.
    · The Departamento de Supervisión de Tribunales, which contrary to some project
       reports, was not created by the reorganization, although now linked to the Judicial
       Career Council, is physically located in another building. Given its responsibility
       for investigating complaints against judges, it would make more sense to place it
       with the latter. Moreover, it, like the office of judicial evaluation (also part of the
       Council) lacks sufficient vehicles to do its investigative and preventive (normal
       supervisions) work.
    · Supervisión and the Junta de Disciplina (another part of the Council, responsible
       for reviewing complaints about judges and making recommendations on
       disciplinary actions) should both be decentralized The former now has a branch
       office in Quetzaltenango, but it is already overburdened, and the Junta's efficacy




                                            29

          in adjudicating cases is greatly hindered by its inability (for practical reasons) to
          operate outside Guatemala City.
    · The Judicial School, which is also part of the auxiliary offices, seems to do fairly
          well with the orientation course, but its in-service training are not systematic, and
          there are numerous complaints about its requiring judges, on very short notice, to
          attend courses they have already taken, repeatedly.16 Obviously, a better record
          system kept by the Council with judicial profiles and a real plan for in-service
          training would help, but so far no one has promoted that.
    · Human Resources now has a database on civil service employees (those in
          administrative and auxiliary offices, as well as courtroom staff) but it serves
          largely to track attendance and calculate pay. There is still no evaluation program,
          and no expanded database that would allow the tracking of any sort of career path.
          Moreover, neither it, nor the Council, has done anything to systematize the
          situation of courtroom support staff (auxiliares judiciales), a group seeming to fall
          between the two stools, officially civil service, but actually aspirants to judgeships.
    · Although the judiciary installed an IFMS, it was the system developed with Bank
          funds for the executive branch (SIAF). The project took no part in its installation,
          nor in training in its use, and it is still not linked to the other administrative
          software (some of it developed on very rudimentary databases like Access)
          funded by the project. The Director of Financial Administration has requested
          assistance in improving the system, but so far has received no response from the
          PCU (Moore, 2007).
.

There is no doubt that the restructuring and reengineering represent improvements in
what was a wholly chaotic prior situation (Louza, 2007). However, the few measures of
impacts offered by UMOJ and its external consultant (Novoa 2006) are fairly peripheral ­
documented decreases in times to register lawyers and notaries or to receive certificates
of no criminal record, and the increases in fees collected by both services. Even the
claim (Novoa 2006) that administrative costs have been reduced seems doubtful, given
that total administrative staff increased by 78 percent between 2002 and 2006 (ASIES,
2006; 64). The restructuring was positive; it just ended too soon. Lack of counterpart
interest may be one explanation, but it also bears mention that the project design only
demanded that it be planned, applied, and "tested." The decentralized administrative
centers, while potentially another source of improvements, are for the most part not yet
functional (Moore, 2007), and the same questions could be raised as to their further,
effective development. In summary, the real improvements in performance achieved by



16 As an anecdotal illustration, the course mentioned most frequently was "intellectual property." Someone
explained to us that the course was sponsored by the American Chamber of Commerce because of its
interest in influencing judicial thinking on this theme. (We were also told that banks financed courses on
debt collection to sway judges toward accepting credit card debt as "títulos ejecutivos" thus allowing it to
be processed through the much faster juicio ejecutivo.) Because the "invitations" to the course are backed
by a blanket decree signed by the Chief Justice, nonattendance constitutes a "falta grave" (refusal to follow
an order from the Justice).




                                                      30

the administrative and auxiliary restructuring could get a moderately unsatisfactory to
moderately satisfactory, but only on the basis of a comparison with the status quo ante
and a qualitative assessment of their potential future impacts. It is also disturbing that
the long-time PCU "subcoordinator" contends that the judiciary's ordinary administrative
offices are still incapable of managing this type of operation.

Attention to the third element, strengthening actual judicial performance came later and
ended even more abruptly. Slightly later attention is not entirely illogical, assuming the
work in the other two areas lays a crucial base, for example in establishing a system for
monitoring judicial performance. Unfortunately, this did not happen. As noted, an early
(2001) effort by PROFED to improve case processing in pilot family courts was not
picked up by the project, despite formal cooperation between the two donors. In 2002
and 2003, there was an interesting and promising effort, largely conducted through one
local consultant, to help courts reduce internal processing times ­ by rationalizing
internal workflow and eliminating steps not required by law. Unfortunately, the process
ended with the change of courts ­ for reasons which we again do not understand (new
priorities, failure of the WB and the UMOJ to lobby with the newcomers?). Moreover,
the failure to develop a basic set of valid statistics on court caseloads and some further
attempt to measure processing times means that impact would have been difficult to
determine. The project only addressed the latter at mid term (2004) and due to problems
with procurement, the study was only completed at the end of 2006. Moreover, because
of its design (the TOR provided by UMOJ) it did not provide adequate information either
on delays or their causes.17 The contractor never produced a satisfactory delay reduction
program, but it is doubtful it could have done so using the information it was asked to
collect or in the time allowed.

Some of the activities conducted with the auxiliary offices (centralization of notification
for the Guatemala City courts, the work of the Judicial Council's Supervision Department,
Evaluation Unit, and Disciplinary Board) might have had some impact on reducing
delays and raising productivity, but were hampered by the absence of good statistics and
adequate methodologies. The project could have worked on both, but did not. Higher
salaries (introduced independently of the project, but equated by UMOJ with an
improved incentive system) and the stricter entry standards introduced by the judicial



17 The inventory covered only cases entered after 2002 in five cabeceras de distrito (courts in the principal
city of each district). Thus, it did not include all active cases, even in those courts, and moreover was an
inadequate basis for calculating delays inasmuch as the starting date was too recent. Not surprisingly (in
fact logically) the results indicated that delays in reaching a firm judgment averaged under three years for
all types of cases. Neither the PCU nor the contractor seemed to notice that most cases had not been
resolved, thus suggesting either 1) that cases not resolved within three years would never be resolved or 2)
that most cases took more time to reach a firm judgment. It bears mentioning that by 2005 LCSPS had
conducted studies using casefile analysis to explore delays and related problems in five other countries of
the region. The first of these, done in Mexico (World Bank, 2002), faced similar problems and resolved
them with a second sample of adjudicated cases to determine times to resolution. Unfortunately, the
research team, whose members could have provided advice, was not contacted as the Guatemala study was
being designed, nor, so far as we could determine, was the Mexico report made available to the Borrower.




                                                         31

career law may also have produced improvements in efficacy and efficiency, but if that
happened, little credit goes to the project, and in any event, it cannot be measured. In
short, although several items under component A (institutional strengthening) and one
under component B (Transparency as it involves incentives) might have impacted
efficiency and efficacy, these received short shrift from the project. Both efforts and
progress here are unsatisfactory.

Two additional activities promoted by the project, the automated case management
system and ADR, might improve efficacy, but neither has advanced far enough to do so.
In theory, and apart from its access benefits, widespread use of ADR should reduce court
congestion and thus delay by diverting conflicts to this alternative forum. Unfortunately,
even in the most utilized centers, the amount of demand attended is still too low to have
this effect. Moreover, there is considerable debate among the experts as to whether ADR
really reduces court congestion or simply attracts cases that would not have gone to court.
Nonetheless, the innovation appears popular with users, and the FUNCEDE (2006) study
indicated considerable demand for more mediation centers among inhabitants of small
municipalities and rural areas.

As for the new case management system, the team specialist evaluated it as of good
quality, with certain functions not available in similar systems developed elsewhere, but
also with problems, still being addressed, as regards ease of use (Louza, 2007). Although
UMOJ claims that efficacy and efficiency will be greatly improved with its nation-wide
application, this will easily take five years and will require a considerable expansion in
the Judiciary's Informatics and Telecommunications Center (CIT) staff now assigned to
the task, as well as further technical assistance to help with modifications to the programs
and to ensure the source codes are adequately protected against manipulation. Its impact
will also depend on quality control of data entry; adequate statistical analysis, and the
conversion of the results into new policies. For that to happen, internal analytic capacity
will have to be created (preferably in SPDI, not CIT ­ analysis is best not left to software
engineers), and judicial leadership will have to be convinced it is important. Several
judiciaries in the region have already adopted similar software with limited impact on
efficacy and efficiency because of the absence of these other elements. Use of statistics
to enhance judicial management is clearly an emerging global trend, but in Latin America
there are few countries (Chile, possibly parts of Argentina and Brazil, Costa Rica but
with some limitations) that have moved to adopt it.            As many more have case
management software, its presence is clearly only a facilitating factor, not a solution.

In the end, neither the judiciary's own statistics, nor those offered by the UMOJ study
(Novoa, 2006) or external observers (ASIES, 2006) suggest an increase in the
productivity of the courts. Production has risen, but largely because of the addition of
more judges. Demand has grown still more rapidly. ASIES (2006:65) estimates a case
clearance or disposition rate (cases resolved over those entering in one year) of 10
percent for the entire period. This is extremely low, especially considering the apparently
light average workload.      Novoa (2006; 119) finds an increase in congestion (cases
resolved over total active cases) from 2000 to 2004; in light of the bad statistics on
backlog and the likelihood it is far underestimated, the real rate may be still higher.



                                              32

However, part of the problem may arise in legal impediments to judges closing inactive
cases ex oficio; this means that absent the necessary request from the parties, much of the
backlog may be composed of abandoned cases. The inventory and sample might have
explored this, but did not. There is no good analysis on average delays. The case
inventory (NCSC, 2006) found that most cases in most materials had not reached
resolution within the three-year period covered.     The FUNCEDE (2006) study, which
only asked those interviewed for their perceptions on delays, found most considered them
excessive, although predominately within the one to three year range, and reported no
recent improvement in reducing them. The interviews did not ask about resolution rates
(what percentage of cases were resolved).

Credibility of Judiciary Improved

Most of the relevant activities are in component two (Transparency), but some of those in
component one (as regards delay), component three (especially sensitization of judges
and development of a plan for recognizing traditional dispute resolution), and component
four (those involving communication polices) are also relevant. Here the focus is on
components 2 and 4, in part because they are not treated above, and in part because they
together seem to get at the two sides of the problem ­ the lack of credibility because of
real corruption and because of the judiciary's failure to "make its case" as regards efforts
to improve the situation.

Going by the polls (including those conducted by other agencies, CEJA 2003 and 2005),
the combined effect of the two strategies has yet to be felt. The 2003 and 2007 surveys
did note some improvements as regards:         respondents' familiarity with the judicial
modernization program, their estimation of cost as a barrier, and in the 2007 survey, in
training of judges and staff. However, perceptions of corruption, poor attention to users,
and delay remained fairly constant. The question then is whether the project selected the
most appropriate path for making a difference ­ the connections between the PDO and
the activities emphasized ­ and furthermore, whether implementation followed the plan.

Again, the absence of statistics for monitoring performance is critical, not as a measure of
impact but as a means of achieving it. Knowing you are being watched may be the most
fundamental incentive for doing a better job, more important than raises, ethics and self-
esteem courses, or even skills training. Statistics would also have helped the Department
of Supervision, the Evaluation Unit, the Junta de Disciplina, and Human Resources
evaluate performance, identify problems, and propose and monitor improvements. The
initial creation and/or restructuring of these offices, the early technical assistance and
equipment provided to them, and programs to inform system users and operators of their
functions were also important, but more work in all these areas was needed, and for the
most part was not done. The evaluation program for judges continues to receive criticism
as does the rather truncated career it oversees ­ composed of only two levels, justices of
the peace and judges of first instance. However, administrative and courtroom support
staff still lack evaluation programs, another flaw that needs to be addressed. In short,
while the project did take steps in promoting the creation of a human resource
management program, it stopped early and far short of what was needed. In this light, the



                                            33

many complaints of those interviewed in the FUNCEDES study about court personnel
not seeming motivated to do their work well are easy to explain. As for the core issue in
credibility, corruption, the statistics from the two disciplinary units indicate several
problems:

    · The large number of complaints dismissed without a hearing suggest either that
        users do not understand what constitutes abuse or that the units simply are not
        working.
    · The small number of disciplinary actions taken is indicative of other problems:
        inadequate investigation (for lack of skills, incentives, or resources); the logistical
        obstacles posed for both defendants and complainants who do not reside in the
        capital city; complainants' fears of retaliation; or certain procedural obstacles
        (flawed regulatory and legal framework).
    · Finally, it bears noting that the most the disciplinary units can do is recommend
        dismissal of those they find to have committed major infractions.               Their
        recommendations are not binding and it is up to the Supreme Court or the Chief
        Justice to take the final decision. They do not always follow the recommendation.
    · The same is true of the evaluation unit's recommendations as to judicial
        appointments and terminations, and in the latter case, those with low evaluations
        have been relatively successful in filing an "amparo"18 against the unit's findings.

Obviously, many of the obstacles here, because of their political and legal nature, are
beyond what the project could have overcome. However, it is significant that it was the
Transparency or Anti-corruption component where expenditures were farthest below
(less than 10 percent) what was budgeted in the PAD.

3.3 Efficiency

No economic analysis was done for the project and the financial analysis emphasized
only the estimated total costs ($165 million) of the judiciary's modernization plan, the
availability of other donor funding to complement the WB contribution, and the steps
taken to ensure adequate administration of project funds. As is usual in these projects, the
economic section refers to the positive economic impacts of reliable judicial enforcement,
reduced corruption, and improved crime control. However, given the impossibility of
determining the project's impact on any of these variables, an ex-post economic analysis
is not feasible. Annex 3 contests the PAD's contention that this type of analysis could
not be done, and in fact argues for conducting one, even absent the necessary statistical
inputs. As has been suggested in the text above, the ICR team has some doubts about the
cost-effectiveness of the activities emphasized, but again this is a matter for further
debate and largely in the abstract. Team members were not alone in expressing doubts. A
former Chief Justice from Sweden, did a short evaluation of the project in June, 2007 and




18An amparo is the standard constitutional protest of a violation of basic rights.




                                                   34

likewise questioned the longer-term value of certain activities with a large "public
relations" component (Svensson, 2007).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

We are rating the outcome moderately unsatisfactory not against what the project
proposed to do (not achieved) but rather against what it really did. The project does not
get a satisfactory or moderately satisfactory because we believe the Borrower and/or the
Bank team could have overcome or circumvented some design flaws, by paying attention
to the mid-term recommendations, placing more emphasis on real improvements in
performance, instead of attempting to spend all the assigned funds with equipment
purchases in the final year (and here there are also concerns as to whether these purchases
coincide with the requirements of the case management system now to be installed). The
project could have promoted other elements (like the abortive efforts to accelerate case
processing, a better inventory and delay reduction program, or the enormous amount of
work needed in human resource management). However, it did the constructions planned
(or most of them ­ in the end one departmental center was omitted), provided essential
equipment, promoted, on its own and with PROFED, some major rationalization of
internal structures, and experimented with important (and so far as could be determined,
unique) exercises in simplifying court procedures. All of this provides a base for further
advances, and its importance should not be discounted simply because the project design
was too ambitious in terms of promises.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Except for some workshops and publications on gender, the project had no special
activities directed at these themes. However, it's overall emphasis on extending access to
marginalized groups and especially to indigenous populations was sufficient to cover
them, and adding still more activities to an already over-ambitious design would not have
been advisable. Whether enough was done to further the larger goal can be debated, but
the underlying justification is sound ­ increasing access to court and alternative services
for the poor, indigenous populations would provide them with the means to resolve their
problems and defend their rights. Women were not selected out as a targeted subcategory
for special treatment, but the project did keep track of gender and indigenous
participation in all of its activities ­ courses, workshops, and ADR services. It does not
appear that analysis of these data produced any readjustments to activities. This is a
serious shortcoming given that Guatemala has been ranked extremely low in protection of
women and very high in violence against women. (Prensa Libre, October 9, 2007)
However, our own quick review of the data did not reveal anything that demanded
immediate attention.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening




                                              35

As this was an institutional development project, these themes have already been dealt
with exhaustively.      As repeatedly noted, WB and other donor efforts effected
considerable advances in imposing a more rational organization for the administrative
and auxiliary structures. However, more work is required to improve coordination of the
parts and the functions carried out by each of them. The PCU erred in not transferring
more programming and implementation to the judiciary itself. This should be an aim of
any future operation ­ with a goal of phasing out or eliminating the PCU over the next
five years. While other donors have focused more attention on improving the activities
of individual units within the larger organization, the WB and UNDP took the lead in the
2000 macro-reengineering which might not have occurred without their combined efforts.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The project, less by its design than how it evolved, seems to have encouraged the judges'
interest in buildings and equipment, and strengthened their initial inclination to equate
these with improved performance. This is unfortunate and may pose problems for the
design and negotiation of the next project. If anything the project amply demonstrates
that buildings and equipment are not magic bullets, and that while the public recognizes
their presence, there existence is not necessarily directly correlated with overall
improvements in performance.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Time constraints and limited financing for this ICR did not allow a beneficiary survey or
stakeholder workshops. However, as noted above, a survey sponsored by UMOJ and
conducted after the project had closed (Novoa and Tacao, 2007) did indicate that some
stakeholders, when presented with direct questions, did perceive a few improvements in
certain aspects of court performance. The evaluation team reached the same conclusions
in its interviews, but could not attribute the results to the project in particular. This is
because there were many other donor projects and additional changes on-going at the
same time. For example as reported in Novoa and Tacao, knowledgeable users did not
note any improvement in delays and congestion, but did mention a better quality of
judges because of the introduction of the career law, improved systems for selecting and
evaluating lower level judges (justices of the peace, first instance and trial judges), better
infrastructure and equipment, more first instance courts, and such innovations as the
mobile courts, ADR, and automation of Antecedentes Penales and Protocolos. While the
project cannot take credit for the career law, it did help set up the recruitment and
evaluation systems.     The earlier, 2003 survey also identified two positive changes:
greater user knowledge of the judicial structure and its modernization plan, and a marked
reduction (20 percentage points) in the belief that justice was costly. More information
on the survey results is given in Annex 6.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The project, along with activities undertaken by other donors and by the government, has
set a base for future advances in the PDO. The judiciary is now better structured and


                                            36

better equipped to produce the outcomes the project promised and has made some
advances in achieving them. There are still problems in the administrative structure and
its internal operations, in the legal framework regulating it and especially the aspects
regarding human resources (both judges and administrative staff), and in the judiciary's
overall ability to monitor its own performance and that of its individual members. These
are all areas where further emphasis is critical to avoid backsliding or, more likely,
preservation of the current glass-half-full status. Citizen interest in achievement of the
goals stated in the PDO has not weakened. The fact that their dissatisfaction with judicial
performance has not diminished, while perhaps underestimating the progress made, is
thus a positive factor in mitigating risks to the development outcome. It will, however, be
important that future Bank work and that of other donors now concentrate on using the
base to push forward with the underlying objectives, finetuning where necessary, but
focusing specifically on producing visible improvements to the quality of justice
delivered to the citizenry.            The project itself has introduced an additional risk by
encouraging judicial personnel to define improvements in terms of infrastructure and
equipment; while outsiders do recognize these "improvements," they clearly are looking
for something more and this will have to be stressed in any new operation.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory. Project preparation was exemplary and deserves to be
replicated in other such efforts. Although the ICR team did not review in detail how the
time was used, the three or so years devoted to preparing the ground appeared to have
been well spent. The final design was still an impediment to successful implementation,
but it seems terribly unfair to judge a project designed in the late 1990s against criteria in
effect ten years later (which would have lowered the grade). However, even assessed
against the standards of the time, there was room for improvements, building on, but not
limiting itself to the results of the participatory events.19 Presentation of components and
activities is overly vague and somewhat confusing; for the most part the component
definition is simply a list of activities to be supported. An emphasis on inputs rather than
outcomes and impacts and a failure to specify definitive causal links between activities
and overall objectives probably contributed to many problems (lack of follow-up on key
activities, delays in implementation of some, failure to take any actions in others). The
PAD might have emphasized the predictable change of topmost authorities every five
years, and with them many administrative directors. In the section on risks, there is only
a mention of the moderate chances of the new Supreme Court's lower commitment to
reform, with the suggestion that this would be resolved through discussions during the
mid-term review, on-going workshops with stakeholders, and monitoring and evaluation



19One assumes, after all, that this is the Bank's role as a "knowledge bank," helping countries improve
their proposals for resolving problems their stakeholders identify.




                                                       37

(an activity that remained underdeveloped). As the Court changed in 1999, a mid-term
review in 2002 would be a little late to make corrections.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory. The mid-term supervision was excellent, as were
earlier BB and TF-financed evaluations of some components. Unfortunately few of the
recommendations provided therein were put into practice for reasons the ICR team does
not understand. It clearly would have been helpful to continue with and use this type of
external assessment; a lesson to be adopted in future projects. Although the initial two
funding reallocations responded to counterpart requests, the movement of so much
money into the goods category, absent efforts to ensure all components were receiving
adequate attention, seems questionable. This it should be noted is a problem not related to
the TT alone, but also involved higher WB management. The first reallocation in
particular should have provided an opportunity to push for advances in the neglected
areas and especially those highlighted in the mid-term supervision. The lesson here is
that any such action requires far more attention from management and not just from the
task team.

The project did a good job on attracting positive public attention, in Guatemala and in the
Bank ­ for example, the communications component and the inaugurations of the various
construction projects, as well as activities like the initial two mobile courts, two programs
with school children ("A Day with Justice," and "Judge for a Day"), and a Market Place
prize winning activity featuring workshops to raise awareness about new justice of the
peace courts in 36 rural municipalities. Again, these are models other projects might
follow as they clearly facilitate the way for the harder actions. However, as regards the
latter, there are some concerns. Interviews with Bank staff in Guatemala indicated they
had expressed concern to the team as to advances in PDO achievement (i.e. concrete
results in the quality of services) but received no satisfactory answer. Public relations, in
short are an often overlooked responsibility of task teams, but they cannot replace
advances in more substantive areas. If most projects err in neglecting the former, this one
may have counted too much on their power to move other areas.

Project reporting was deficient. ISRs were pretty much boilerplate (often repeating the
same language in 2 or 3 periods) and rarely signaled emerging issues and problems.
They never discussed major changes, like the reallocations, and introduced other
modifications (reduction in indicators tracked, elimination of "co-financing" counterpart)
with no explanation whatsoever. Ratings never deviated from S (Satisfactory), and
although the mid-term supervision was mentioned, there was no discussion of its
recommendations or a plan to comply with them. ISRs also sometimes gave credit to the
project for things clearly done by other donors ­ public defense mentioned in ISR 10
where the project did some training, but most of the work was done by MINUGUA,
UNDP, and USAID ­ or announced progress in areas (a case recording system) which
simply overstates what was actually done.

Although the Bank project team was entirely located in Washington, it seemed reluctant
to involve local staff in supervision, at one point insisting that all procurement documents


                                               38

be sent first to the purview of the project team before being forwarded to the local
procurement office (interviews Guatemala, September, 2007) For a project and country
of this complexity, this policy seems highly unwise. It also bears noting that there were
at least two specialists in LCSPS with substantial knowledge of Guatemala and of
regional judicial reform problems, and that neither one was asked to provide any support
to the project. Instead, for internal support, the project relied largely on very junior trust-
fund and other short-term consultants. Finally, although there were no major problems to
be addressed in financial management and procurements, Bank staff did not react soon
enough to the undesirable expenditures patterns. The disproportionate amount of funds
spent on the PCU, the lower amounts spent on the rest of component D and component B,
and the lag in spending on consultant services might have been identified earlier,
allowing more effective attention to the neglected components and eliminating the need
for a second transfer of a large portion of funds to equipment purchases in the final year.
Again, responsibility here cannot be placed solely on the TT; management should have
recognized the problems and requested further discussions.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

For the reasons stated above.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Government's most important contribution to project advances was the enactment of
critical legislation and constitutional reforms ­ the Judicial Council and Career law, a law
covering civil service judicial employees ­ and increases in the court budget and salaries.
Without these changes, many activities contemplated in the PAD would have been
difficult if not impossible to implement. Nonetheless, further commitment to the project
goals, either from the Government as a whole or from the judiciary, was never visible.
The tendency towards an over optimistic interpretation of many of the advances made
(not so much in the WB project as in the overall judicial reform) is widely commented
within Guatemala.        Despite the above steps have yet to be taken either by the
Government or the judiciary to make the necessary corrections. ­ for a start, in improving
the administrative problems, creating a career for administrative employees, creating a
performance monitoring (statistics) system, or improving the evaluation and complaints
processing mechanisms. The WB could have pushed, but this would have been easier if
the Borrower had expressed interest.

It also bear noting that certain aspects of the 1986 Constitution as regards selection and
term lengths of the Court and appellate bench did pose impediments to creating strong
judicial leadership. The periodic full renovation of both, the continued politicization of
the appointment process, the annual election of the Court president, and the latter's
ability to place and remove many administrative officers at will obstructed continuity in
judicial policy making and implementation. Procedures for supervision and evaluation of
judges, their support staff, and administrative personnel are underdeveloped (there are


                                             39

none for the latter two categories) and remain highly controversial. Initial support to the
responsible units should have been continued as these are areas where technical
assistance would have been extremely useful. According to several observers (Moore,
2007), the present Court divided responsibility for the departments among the 13 justices,
a practice justified as increasing attention to each, but also reputedly augmenting the
incidence of patronage in appointments, promotions, and transfers of judicial and
administrative staff.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

On the plus side, the creation of a strong PCU and considerable continuity in its staffing
(including the retention of the same "subcoordinator" until early 2007 ­ when she was
appointed to the position of General Manager for the Judiciary) were important factors in
maintaining and eventually accelerating project implementation. The decision to have
the PCU implement judicial portions of the IADB sectoral project and to coordinate with
other donors in the construction and placement of infrastructure was also critical. The
PCU's financial management and handling of procurement was validated by a series of
Bank audits and supervisions. Nonetheless, the project is ending with two major contract
disputes, to which both inadequate Bank supervision and PCU failure to push for a
solution (as opposed to simply berating the contractor for poor performance), have
contributed.

On the minus side, the PCU extended its role beyond implementation to virtual
ownership of the project. The current coordinator, a Magistrate assigned to oversee
implementation, described his role as more of an administrative role instead of one
requiring a more direct involvement in policy decisions. One consultant working on a
high priority activity reported he had never been able to meet with the Court presidents
and that his meetings with the "coordinator" were perfunctory at best. (However, see
Moore, 2007 for a more positive view.) The coordinator forms part of a judicial
commission (composed of four magistrates, the judiciary's general manager, and the
subcoordinator) which meets monthly to review project progress, but again gives no
indication of a more pro-active role.      (The CMU did report occasional visits by
committee members or other justices to lobby for the project, but that is different from
pro-active management.) In its interviews with administrative and judicial staff, the ICR
team also repeatedly heard references to the PCU's "disclosure policy" and many who
did not complain simply noted that their contact with the project had stopped after the
early period (reorganization, restructuring, and the delivery of equipment and training.)
Only a few units ­ CENADOJ, the Judicial School, and the CIT -- expressed positive
views about continuous support from the PCU. Their perceptions appear accurate, but in
the case of the first two, this support may have confused rather than clarified their roles
and programs. CENADOJ appears to have taken over some functions belonging to the
Communications Office, while the multitude of short courses co-sponsored by the PCU
did not encourage the School to develop a consistent program of in-service training. In
many cases, short courses and workshops were spur of the moment interventions,
seemingly unconnected.



                                            40

The current contract disputes are not the only ones in which the PCU has been involved.
At least one contract was terminated after initial implementation, with the contractor
charging inadequate support from the PCU and the PCU charging that the contractor was
not producing anything.20 Several contractors complained about similar lack of support
as well as about ambiguous terms of reference and the PCU's post-hoc, unilateral
interpretations as to what they meant. As regards the relationship with UNOPS, which
appears to have worsened since 2004,21 the PCU claims UNOPS changed its TORs
needlessly, while UNOPS holds that the TORS submitted by the PCU were incomplete,
inconsistent, and of poor quality.              The ICR team had no time (nor the necessary
expertise) to investigate the competing claims. However, a team member did examine
the TORS for one contract still under dispute (the inventory and delay reduction "study"),
which was wholly managed by the PCU, and found it very poorly designed (see sections
above). The software contract required the production of a thesaurus, an element that
disappeared from such activities over fifteen years ago, once open search engines were
developed.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

Although many of the impediments to government and implementing agency
performance in particular originated in a legal framework, political context, and certain
design flaws that were beyond their control, borrower performance is rated as moderately
satisfactory. The ICR team believes the Bank and the Borrower might have worked
together to identify and adopt more satisfactory responses to these obstacles. It is
debatable where the initiative should have started, but either one could have taken it and
the other could have joined in ­ unfortunately, neither one did so, and thus the grades
assigned here split the responsibility. The Court, the official counterpart, seemed quite
content to let the PCU makes its decisions for it, and showed no signs of questioning
some of its more doubtful actions ­ absorbing work that should have gone to the
judiciary's administrative offices, expanding its size to encompass the major share of the
fourth project component's budget, and entering into conflicts with contractors where the
Court might have examined the issues more closely. Over the entire period, its most
decisive actions were to request reallocations of funds to reduce technical services and
increase equipment purchases. Arguably the Bank had a responsibility for seeking the
Court's more active involvement, but just as one understands why Court members might
not want to rock the boat, it is also understandable why the Bank might find engaging an
essential passive client more than it wished to take on.



20 This was the first firm contracted for the case management software. The PCU first mentioned the
cancellation to the team, but other interviewees who claimed to know the situation, provided the
counterarguments.

21 Reports that PCU officials had gone to New York to request the removal of a UNOPS official were
confirmed by both UNOPS and the PCU subcoordinator. Since the trips required no objections, the travel
to New York, if not its purpose, is also verified by project records.

6. Lessons Learned

Design and preparation

Although so obvious as to hardly bear mention, without counterpart buy-in, a judicial or
institutional reform effort will not get far. It is the corollary to this statement that is more
important, buy-in means not just accepting the donor contributions, but rather
internalizing and actively pursuing the change goals behind them.

As a corollary to this corollary, it is also important that the Borrower understand and
commit to the overall project goals and PDO and component indicators. In one of our
meetings with the former and current PCU subcoordinators (the official actually in charge
of the PCU), the ICR team reviewed the indicators with them and it was evident that
there was a lack of clarity on several.

Participatory design is good, but can lead to a project "designed by a committee." Highly
qualified international assistance is also important, especially for countries only starting
on the judicial reform route, and thus likely to repeat the errors of the past.

Projects composed of a list of activities run the risk of turning implementation into a
check-list and moreover of doing the more attractive rather than the most important. An
appraisal document needs to outline a strategy, major lines of action, and sequencing of
intermediate steps, not as a detailed Gantt Chart, but rather as a logical narrative that can
guide implementation. Great caution should be exercised in specifying activities other
than those (e.g. creation of a statistical system to track court performance) constituting
important benchmarks.

Indicators are important and should be chosen carefully on the basis of several criteria:
closeness of relationship to the development objectives being tracked; likely availability
of data; likelihood of measurable change within the project life; and ease of interpretation.
Nearly all the indicators used in this project fail on one or more of those categories.

Given the nature of institutional change as a three step process ­ inputs to induce the
change, changes in internal behaviors, and finally improvements in outcomes and impacts
­ a five year project may not be able to complete the entire process, and moreover,
successful passage through steps one and two can over the short run, negatively affect the
third (the most classic example being the increase in reported crime elicited by a better
functioning criminal justice system). Project design must thus anticipate both the slow
passage from one step to another and the possibility of short-term negative results on the
outcome/impact indicators.      This may argue for focusing on the intermediate step
(behavioral change) or a more sophisticated (but explicit) interpretation of the anticipated
changes in the impact variables.

Implementation




                                              42

If baseline data and other means of tracking performance and project achievements do
not exist when a project goes into effect, they need to be created early on. This is critical
to establishing concrete performance targets, focusing implementers on achieving them,
establishing a monitoring and evaluation system, and allowing the project to demonstrate
advances.

A PCU is a double-edged sword and where possible, one project goal should be its
eventual phasing out and elimination. It is always tempting for the WB to rely on the
PCU in the interest of faster implementation, but from the institutional development
standpoint care should be taken that the PCU does not expand its control over the
operation and take on activities better transferred to the, admittedly, less efficient normal
organizational offices.

Given the WB's own operating procedures and the difficulty of constant monitoring of
the myriad events that can affect implementation, use of local staff to maintain a
permanent dialogue with the target agency (and not just the PCU) is highly recommended.
USAID's ability to affect a series of targeted, but highly important changes (introduction
of 24-hour centers, juzgados de turno, to conduct the initial hearings for detainees in
criminal cases; redesign of the evidence storage facilities; introduction of a new model
for first instance criminal courts; transfer of underworked justices of the peace from
central Guatemala to the nearby Villanueva; and multi-disciplinary approaches in
provincial criminal justice centers) was conditioned by having a full-time, highly
experienced contractor on the ground who could convince the judicial authorities to take
these steps. If the WB does not have local staff qualified to do this, thought might be
given to including an experienced consultant on the supervision team and having that
person (or persons) make frequent trips to discuss the content of implementation with the
counterparts and other stakeholders. A local NGO or consultant might also be used,
although this could lead to other problems in a politically charged environment.

Transferring substantial amounts of unused funds to massive equipment purchases, while
understandable in light of the WB emphasis on disbursements, is a second or even third
best choice. The large unexpended balance precipitating this action was predictable early
on, and could have been handled by encouraging attention elsewhere (for example, in
providing technical and even material assistance to the various disciplinary and
evaluation bodies in the human resources office and Judicial Council, or to following up
on the many recommendations from the mid-term evaluation).              In the end, a final
equipment purchase might still have occurred, but the amount could have been reduced
and more progress made in more basic areas of institutional strengthening.

Even with joint implementation agencies and formal donor committees, donor
coordination remains problematic. This is not simply a question of personal relationships
and organizational operating procedures, but also of the models underlying each one's
work. Although rarely mentioned, the construction programs managed by the PCU for
the WB and IADB involved different models ­ the WB centers were for housing court
services; those for the IADB emphasized multi-organizational teams working on criminal
justice. A more productive way of identifying and discussing such differences needs to
be found.


                                             43

In collegial organizations and especially those with frequent turnovers, organizational
leadership is especially problematic, but unless it can be developed, PCU mission creep is
likely and difficult areas are likely to be avoided (as even a strong PCU may be reluctant
to enter them).

"Institutional strengthening" does not end with a new organization chart, equipment, and
manuals ­ it must be followed up throughout the project (and provisions for follow-up
should be stressed in project design).

Evaluation and after

Where many actors are involved in promoting changes, attribution of results to any one
will be extremely difficult, and may only be identifiable at the input level.      From the
standpoint of designing better operations, however, who did what may be far less
important than what did and did not work to induce fundamental change.

Bank records (e.g. what is in IRIS) are a very incomplete source of information on what
happened. Unfortunately, the Bank encourages this with its own incentive system ­
reporting anything as unsatisfactory or identifying emerging problems is only likely to
cause a TTL grief except in those rare cases where the authorities insist on this.

ISRs by their very format do not encourage a good recounting of progress and problems.
The ICR team did not find them to be a reliable source of information on past events and
suggests three types of changes: a better review by management; some changes to the
format to encourage the inclusion of more information; and some changes in the
incentive systems to encourage greater realism in reporting.

A follow-up operation is desirable, but only if it can focus less on material assistance and
more on institutional change. However, this will be difficult to negotiate and design.
Ideally, the design process should be participatory, but something short of the mass
meetings used for the first project. Emphasis should be on the quality of debate and
attention to real problems of the type identified here and in other treatments (some listed
in Annex 9) of Guatemala's justice system.

If a PCU is used in a follow-on project, its gradual elimination should be part of the plan.
Amounts spent on "PCU strengthening" should be controlled, and in no case should the
PCU be used to implement activities corresponding to existing judicial agencies.

Guatemala now faces, and any follow-up project should address a dilemma not
uncommon in the region (or for that matter in many more developed countries). This is
the implicit trade-off between increased efficiency and increased access in situations
where a significant portion of the population is widely dispersed in isolated rural areas.
Doubling or tripling the number of judges and courtrooms (or adding substantially more
mediation centers), as several of those interviewed suggested, would increase overall
inefficiency and raise the courts' share of the national budget above what appears to be a
reasonable 2 percent.       Moreover, it would require similar measures for police,
prosecutors, and public defenders, although of all four groups only the police (with 150


                                              44

police per 100,000 inhabitants, as opposed to the recommended 300) appears radically
understaffed. Further redistribution of existing personnel might help, but in the end, other
alternatives will have to be explored. Aside from efficiency considerations, having a
large number of underworked personnel in areas where they cannot be adequately
supervised is an invitation to other types of problems.

As demonstrated by the arguments about doubling or tripling the number of judges, it
appears that local skills in reform planning and exposure to lessons from international
experience are weak and need to be reinforced. Budgetary implications and constraints
require more attention; implicit notions about "normal" workloads are poorly developed;
legal obstacles are taken as givens (rather than something that can be changed); and there
is an excessive faith in silver bullets (automation, "oralization" of procedures, ethics
codes, and training).     This is an area where the WB has and should exercise a
comparative advantage as regards more sophisticated analysis and program design, not to
impose solutions, but to help counterparts make their choices intelligently.

Contracts with third party implementers (e.g. UNDP and UNOPS) should be written with
great care to ensure the lines of responsibility are clearly stated. If one supervises and the
other approves, then this should be stated in all contracts so as not to replicate the current
catch-22.   The same consideration applies to contracts providing technical or other
assistance to judicial units other than the PCU (a preferred arrangement). The PCU may
sign and supervise the contract, but the latter should stipulate the role of the beneficiary
agency in evaluating deliverables.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

See Annex 7

(b) Cofinanciers

Technically, there were no co-financers. Monies from the UNDP, the IADB and various
bilateral development agencies were initially calculated as part of the counterpart for the
WB operation, but they were never tracked in the audits, and as of 2005, any attempt to
do so was halted. While their use was in theory guided by the sector and judicial
modernization plans, donor funds were separately programmed and negotiated with the
Court and other sector agencies. Although the PCU directly managed $12.95 million of
IADB funds and coordinated with two other donors providing infrastructure, the only true
example of co-financing occurred during the 1999-2001 reengineering when the WB
project and UNDP's PROFED (which managed funds from a variety of donors)
cooperated in implementing the effort. Despite the modernization plans, the creation of a
donor coordination committee, UMOJ's more direct role vis-à-vis four donors (including
the WB), and the joint reengineering exercise, coordination among donors/lenders/and
other stakeholders appeared problematic. This was not new ­ see Hendrix (2000) and
Carothers (2001) on the conflicts between USAID and MINUGUA over the former's
"justice centers" and the proposals of each for reengineering the Public Ministry and
police. In interviews with other donors, references to these conflicts were sometimes


                                              45

made, but in general they were neutral on the WB project (professional courtesy?) and
offered no comments for attribution.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

Interviews were held with three local NGOs (ASIES, the Comunidad Jurídica del
Occidente de la República de Guatemala, and the Observatorio Judicial) and documents
produced by them (ASIES, 2004 and 2006; Juárez, 2007; Ramírez n.d. and 2007) and
others (Mendoza, Pérez and López, 2000) were reviewed. Not unexpectedly, most were
critical of the progress made in improving court performance, although not targeting the
WB project in particular. In fact more criticisms were directed at the legal framework,
continuing political interference in judicial selection and operations, and the failure to
control corruption.

Interviews with judicial staff are referenced in the text.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

The following chart tracks outputs by component and subcomponent, following the
outline in the PAD. Numbers in parentheses under the activities column refer to output
indicators listed in the PAD's Annex 1. As explained above, the "revised" output
indicators were not used absent any evidence that they were formally adopted and
because they are wholly inadequate for tracking component advances.                 A general
summary of progress in each component is given at the beginning of each section.

A. Institutional Capacity Improvement: As noted in the text, work under the project
greatly improved the status quo ante. However, the reorganization and reengineering
were completed early, but never tested or refined. Many offices need further support and
coordination among them is insufficient. Information systems were developed, but are
not integrated and of uneven quality. SGT (case management system) was only recently
implemented in 32 courts and roll-out remains in question. Construction and equipment
for the most part have been delivered as promised, although many key offices could use
additional TA and more equipment.

Departamento de Supervision, automation of Registro de Protocolos, and increased
salaries (however this was not a project achievement).           Several activities were not

C. Strengthening of Access to Justice: major accomplishments were provision of
infrastructure and equipping of what was built, introduction of mobile courts, and
promotion of ADR, via infrastructure, equipment, training, and technical assistance.
Work on reorganizing justice of the peace courts and promoting indigenous law was
minimal, and civil society program appears to have been reconceptualized in the course
of execution.

D. Support for social communication, Judiciary Modernization Commission and
PCU: The major part of funding here (nearly 90 percent) went to the PCU which as a
consequence may have taken on or kept functions better transferred to the OJ offices.
These functions include two figuring in this component ­ social communication and
reform planning and oversight. Nonetheless, certain activities, and indicators, were not
advanced ­ most notably, creation of a monitoring and evaluation system (even within
the PCU) and of a program to gather and publish court data and surveys.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

An economic and financial analysis was not done for this project, and admittedly, given
the lack of basic statistics would have been hard to do. However, contrary to the
assertions of the PAD something could have been produced in each area, even if largely
based on illustrative statistics. The reasons for doing this are largely educational and
inspirational:  by demonstrating, even if in the abstract, the potential financial and
economic benefits of the activities, stakeholders may come to understand a number of
issues better and may be better prepared to take policy decisions. The ICR does not
grade the project (or the Bank's role) any lower for not having done what virtually is
never done for a judicial reform operation. It simply suggests that the contention that this
is impossible (made by many others) be reexamined.

For example, on the financial side, one could have at least calculated the returns of a
potential doubling or tripling of judicial output against the amount invested plus
operating costs versus what would be required to place two or three times the number of
judges and courthouses. While the judicial plan also increased the numbers of judges and
courthouses in the interests of serving isolated areas, it clearly could eliminate some and
has already moved others to areas with insufficient service. In the end, Guatemala
probably does not need more judges ­ it simply needs to increase the productivity of
those in place and better distribute them. The analysis could have included several
alternative scenarios for distribution ­ something the judiciary is going to have to do in
any case

On the economic side, even working with some rather dodgy data (World Bank, 2005) or
methodologies (Sherwood et al's calculation of impacts on growth rates of a "better
judicial system") some simple analytic exercises could have been done to demonstrate
the theoretical impacts of a more effective, credible, and accessible justice system. It is
suggested that this exercises be incorporated in the next preparation, offered with all the
necessary caveats, but nonetheless placing the emphasis on the importance of improving
outputs, and not just inputs. The principal advantage of both exercises would be to get
the assumptions out on the table and encourage participants (on both the Bank and
counterpart side) to reexamine them. Analysis should also include necessary inputs from
other organizations ­ what happens if you increase the number of judges, but not
prosecutors, police, and defenders? ­ opportunity costs, and the impact of different
scenarios.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

The project supported three surveys, two by the same firm using comparable samples and
methodologies (Aragón y Asociados, 2003), and a third, conducted by UMOJ, which we
only learned of after the fieldwork (because of its mention in Novoa and Tacao, 2007).
There was a forth survey (Novoa and Tacao, 2007) conducted after the project closed and
apparently financed from non-project funds. It was done by two consultants hired by
UMOJ who drew their sample from court staff and court users in four urban centers and
one semi-rural area where the project had provided major infrastructure. Unfortunately,
the change in methodology and samples (the first two drew from a universe of the entire
national population; the last was geographically and functionally limited) means that the
final survey is not directly comparable with the first two.

The first two surveys were conducted in 1997 and 2003. The sample size for each was
1,000; they were drawn nationally and stratified to capture groups by gender, age, and
geographic areas (department). A comparison of the two periods shows some loss of
optimism. Questions about the state of the country in general and expectations for the
future brought slightly more negative responses in 2003, with 11 percent judging the
situation as improved in 1997 as opposed to 8 percent in 2003; and positive expectations
for the future declining by one point (from 12 to 11 percent) over the six years. The most
notable improvements tapped by the survey were perceptions of the cost of justice, as
shown below:

While by 2003, respondents showed some familiarity with the modernization program,
and rated certain aspects (Antecedentes Penales and the increase in judges and other
personnel) positively, scores for the overall performance of the judiciary dropped during

Source: Data from Aragón y Asociados, 2003. Note: the options given in 2003 were greater than in 1997.
It is possible this affected the distribution of results, but impossible to tell in which direction.

A final difference between the two sets of results is that the number of mentions of
corruption as the principal problem affecting those seeking justice increased from 26 to
41 percent. In 2003, many more negative factors were mentioned, and some of them
(lack of professional ethics 3 percent, lack of administrative control 3 percent) are also
related to corruption. It is important to recognize that the question and the answers are
not directed only at the judiciary and likely incorporate perceptions of corruption within
the entire sector. In their conclusions the authors note the following:

      · Changes from 1997 to 2003 as involves the increase in the population's ability to
          identify the components of the justice system (Supreme Court, Public Ministry,
          Judges) and a lesser tendency to see justice as depending on the National
          President.
      · The perceived greater accessibility to courts and other sector organizations in
          2003
      · A continuing perception that justice is excessively influenced by groups (the rich,
          the political parties) and organizations external to the sector, but with some
          differences as to which are accorded most importance.
      · A continuing low evaluation of sector performance combined with high
          expectations for an improvement

The survey conducted in 2007 used a sample of 376 respondents drawn from "internal
and external users" of the courts within Guatemala City, Quetzaltenango, Huehuetenango,
Escuintla and El Petén. On the internal users side (202 respondents), judges, secretaries,
mediators, and administrative staff were interviewed. External users (174) included
lawyers, community leaders and civil authorities. Nearly one-third of the respondents
(103) came from Guatemala City. One can conceive of the two groups as the most direct,
but not the targeted beneficiaries of the program, probably better informed of its contents
but also less capable of measuring the impact on the poor, indigenous citizens. (As the
authors note in their introduction, a full vision of citizen perceptions on the state of the
judiciary and the advances made in the modernization program would require a sample of

reform program, Novoa and Tacao, p. 3)

Different questionnaires were used for external and internal users, making it still more
difficult to summarize the results. Also the final report focuses more on external users,
but some graphs do not specify whether one or the other or both groups are included (no
N is cited). Among external users, corruption was still perceived (40.2 percent) as the
major cause of low confidence in the judiciary. When asked about the principal areas in
which services had improved, the following answers were given:

Clearly, donor and government efforts to construct more courts, create more judgeships,
and supply all with equipment had not gone unnoticed. Two activities sponsored by the
WB project alone, the automation of Antecendentes Penales and Protocolos and the
introduction of the mobile courts, were also recognized. However, areas relating to
judicial performance (transparency, delay, treatment of the public) were generally seen as
not having improved. In a separate set of questions on conciliations services (p. 25),
perceptions of improvements were mixed.             This may be due to continuing lawyer

resistance (ADR can be done without their services) with non-lawyer "users" perceiving
them more positively. External users in their majority (73 percent) also did not recognize
programs facilitating access by indigenous communities (p. 29) and believed (73 percent
as well) that linguistic barriers still impeded access.

The summary report focused less on the responses of internal users, but did include their
evaluation of certain aspects of the reform program. One of these was the efficacy of the
measures taken to reduce delay:

Interestingly, although both groups recognize the reform programs (and especially those
financed by the WB), the internal users seem to give more credit to their effects. When
internal users are asked what aspects of judicial "performance" have improved or
worsened, they coincide with external users in mentioning buildings, decentralization,
and equipment, but also mention other factors which external users either ignore or do
not consider important.

External users are considerably less sanguine about program achievements, and 36
percent of them note the need for improvement in all of the following: simplification of
procedures, information, treatment of users, judicial supervision, and the availability of
free legal services. What this suggests (and the answers still do not tap the perceptions of
the general public) is that to date the modernization programs have improved the
situation of those working within the system (although still not as much as they would
like), but that the results have not been translated into better services for external clients ­
certainly not if those who know best (the lawyers and local authorities) perceive
corruption as having increased and see no impact on delay. Interestingly, interviews
done by FUNCEDE and reported in its 2006 study note the same difference ­ when asked
about what is needed, judges and staff mention more buildings, equipment and higher
salaries while users emphasize the failure to resolve the same old problems of corruption,
delay, and poor treatment. This puts into question one of the implicit (and sometimes
explicit) assumptions of many WB projects ­ that better housed, remunerated, and


                                               65

equipped judges will automatically perform better ­ and suggests the need for additional
actions (a bit of stick with the carrot, or simply greater emphasis on improving services)
to bring about the ultimate goals of a more credible, effective, and accessible (in more
than the simple physical sense) justice system.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

There were no cofinanciers of the project. Other donors did commit to supporting
portions of the judiciary's modernization plan and of the overall sector modernization
plan. One (the IADB) shared the same PCU (UMOJ) contributing to its strengthening
with the purchase of equipment, but not salaries, and two others (Norwegian and Dutch
assistance agencies) coordinated closely with UMOJ in their construction of courtrooms.
The UNDP not only assisted procurement activities for the current project, but also was
an equal partner (managing its own funds and those of several other donors) in the
reengineering program of the 1999-2001 period (list of contributions supplied by Josefina
Coutiño, on file with authors). Other stakeholders include members of the judiciary and
other sector institutions, NGOs, the private bar, and court users.

Although interviews were held with several donors and with three NGOs on their
activities and interactions with the WB project, no formal statements on the project were
offered for citation. Interviews were supplemented with written materials and the results
of surveys. In general, remarks were neutral to negative, but this was either affected by
on-going conflicts with UMOJ (USAID, UNDP, UNOPS) or in the case of NGOS and
outside users, so mixed with views on the judiciary and marred by a frequent inability to
separate WB activities from those of the Court or of other donors that we do not believe
they can be taken as evaluations of WB performance. When pressed (see Novoa and
Tarao, 2007), court users and knowledgeable observers generally admitted some
improvements to the judiciary ­ in terms of transparency, better organization, and more
capable judges ­ but do not see any noticeable change in the quality of output. Rural
inhabitants interviewed by FUNCEDE (2006), while quite critical of court performance,
offered positive evaluations on the ADR programs. Many of these positive views can be
attributed to changes the World Bank supported, but in which its direct involvement
varied considerably.

In interviews with judicial staff, as reported in the text, a few (CENODOJ, the Judicial
School, and CIT) were very positive about the project and UMOJ, but others cited only
early support to their activities, seemed less aware of recent developments, and in several
cases reported a "policy of secrecy" on the part of UMOJ. We were led to understand
through discussions with knowledgeable outsiders, that the current divisions in the
Supreme Court (precipitated by the upcoming election of a new President) include
disagreements on the project and especially UMOJ. We were unable to verify this
observation.
