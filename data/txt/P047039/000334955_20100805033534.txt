       The Implementation Completion Report (ICR) is a self-evaluation by the responsible Bank department. The ICR Review is an
       intermediate IEGWB product that seeks to independently verify the findings of the ICR, based on desk work.
       As of July 1, 2006, Institutional Development Impact is assessed as part of the Outcome rating.

                 IEG Mission: Improving development results through excellence in evaluation.

About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Banks self-evaluation process and to verify that the Banks work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses some 20-25 percent
of the Banks lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to
those that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those
for which Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to
generate important lessons.
       To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examines project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
        Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the Borrower
for review. IEGWB incorporates both Bank and Borrower comments as appropriate, and Borrower's comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Banks Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the IEGWB Rating System
     IEGWB's use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to
arrive at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion
(additional information is available on the IEGWB website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's
objectives are consistent with the country's current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project's design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loanlcredit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
       This is a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) covering three Bank
operations to support judicial reform in Ecuador (Loan 4066), Guatemala (Loan 4401)
and Colombia (Loan 708 1).

        In Ecuador, the Judicial Reform Project, costing $14.3 million, was supported by
a loan of $10.7 million, all of which was disbursed. The credit was approved on July 18,
1996 and closed on November 30,2002, five months after the original closing date.

       In Guatemala, the Judicial Reform Project, costing $49.7 million, was supported
by a loan of $33 million, all of which was disbursed. The credit was approved on October
22, 1998 and closed on June 30,2007, three years after the original closing date.

        In Colombia, the Judicial Conflict Resolution Improvement Project, costing $6.66
million, was supported by a loan of $5 million, US$3.9 million of which was disbursed.
The credit was approved on November 8,2001 and closed on June 30,2006, one year
after the original closing date. This project was a learning and innovation loan (LIL). This
PPAR, however, evaluates this loan following the same principles as for regular
investment or technical assistance loans in order to glean as much as possible in terms of
lessons and findings from the comparison of the three projects, while taking into account
the difference in size.'

        Work for this evaluation included (i) desk review of Bank documents and
publications in the area of legal and judicial reform, as well as the project files for each of
the three projects, including the implementation completion reports (ICRs) and the ICR
Reviews for the three operations; (ii) a one-week visit by the principal author to World
Bank Headquarters (March-April 2009), and (iii) a one-week visit to each of the three
countries (April 2009). During the Washington visit the principal author held interviews
with Bank staff responsible for implementation of projects in the justice sector.

        In Guatemala and Ecuador, the main author met with the Bank's Country
Manager. No review of documents was made in the country offices. In each country
project participants and other key sources of information, including government officials,
judges, lawyers, academics and NGO representatives, were interviewed. A list of all
interviewees is provided in Annex B.

         In Guatemala, two visits were made outside the capital: to a Mediation Center in
Chichicastenango and to Juzgudos de Puz in PetCn. In Ecuador, outside Quito, there were
visits to Guayaquil and Cuenca. In Colombia, a planned trip to Medellin was canceled
due to the reluctance of the Medellin judges to meet with anyone from the Bank
associated with the project.

  Following the LIL evaluation methodology would have entailed paying special attention to the monitoring
and evaluation (M&E), the learning objectives, and the assessment of stakeholder response. It would also
have entailed assuming learning "through an outcome-focused pilot" to test the design for a potential full-
scale intervention. In contrast to the focused and limited approach set out in the LIL guidelines, the
Colombia project involved 37 civil circuit courts in the five most populated cities of the country.

       This report was prepared by Mauricio Rubio (consultant; main author). Jaime
Jaramillo-Vallejo (IEG) was the Task Manager. The report benefited from comments
made by Jorge Garcia-Garcia (peer reviewer) and Gita Gopal (panel reviewer), as well as
support from Nestor Ntungwanayo. It was edited by Helen Chin, and H. Joan Mongal
and Agnes Santos provided administrative support.

      The draft PPAR was sent to the Region and to the Governments of Ecuador,
Guatemala and Colombia for comments, but no comments were received from the
governments.

Summary
1.      This PPAR is a cross-country assessment of three World Bank projects
implemented in three Latin American countries to support judicial reform. These
projects and the associated loans, as approved, were: (i) the Judicial Reform Project
(1996) amounting to $10.7 million to the Republic of Ecuador; (ii) the Judicial Reform
Project (1998) amounting to $33.0 million to the Republic of Guatemala; and (iii) the
Judicial Conflict Resolution Improvement Project (200 1) amounting to $5.O million to
the Republic of Colombia. The rationale for judicial reform assistance by the World
Bank was built on the assumptions that the rule of law promotes economic growth and
reduces poverty, and that it does so by enhancing opportunity, empowerment, and
security through laws and legal institutions. These three operations were also chosen
because they are among the few that can shed some light on how the Bank has performed
in post-conflict countries in its support for institutions viewed as critical to underpinning
peace and reconciliation, such as the judiciary.

2.       Before the 1990s, the three countries had lived through internal conflicts:

     0   Ecuador, despite lower levels of violence, suffered greater economic and political
         instability than the other two countries, partly because of the presence of and the
         need to integrate an important indigenous population (25 percent). Judicial
         reform efforts in the country began as part of a state modernization agenda, and
         the Bank had a leading role both in the assessment of the judiciary and in the
         design of the national judicial reform.

     0   Guatemala ended a forty-year-long armed conflict in 1996 and had to reconstruct
         its economy and build a state that was better able to take account of the claims of
         the groups involved in the conflict. Judicial reform was considered to be essential
         to promote post-conflict reconstruction, social stability, and economic growth.

     0   Colombia went through an armed confrontation among outlawed armed groups,
         and between them and the national army. A new constitution deriving from a
         peace agreement with one of the guerrilla groups brought important changes to
         the judicial system, and addressed some of the key judicial issues, but the Bank's
         project did not deal with any of them. Instead, the project aimed at improving
         judicial conflict resolution services.

Achievement of Development Objectives

3.      In Ecuador, the proposed project aimed at increasing efficiency, effectiveness
and transparency in the judicial process by improving case administration procedures and
the infrastructure, expanding the use of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms
within the court system, improving access to justice by the public and women in
particular, and pursuing court reform and research as well as legal education. Although
the main objective to reduce court case load appears to have only been achieved in one
province, the objective of increasing access to justice through alternate dispute resolution
processes and through the smaller components was fully achieved. Overall, achievement
of development objective is assessed to be substantial.

     0   As regards efficiency and effectiveness, the impact of the project in the reduction
         of pending cases was not conclusive, was slight and, above all, was transitory.
         However, the project was considered to be useful in rationalizing management,
         human resources allocation and even the quality of judicial decisions.
         Although there was no baseline with which to compare results attained,
         alternative dispute resolution mechanisms were considered a success under the
         project. The mediation centers are helping to relieve congestion and delays in the
         ordinary courts and people prefer them because they settle disputes in two weeks,
         in contrast with the courts' eight months.
     0   The program to help increase women's access to justice not only exceeded initial
         expectations with regard to the number of users and services offered, but it also
         improved access to justice for poor women in a sustainable manner. Women who
         used the legal aid centers are better off legally, economically, and feel reassured,
         as reflected in qualitative and quantitative measures. The majority of the women
         polled considered that the services accessed under the project had helped reduce
         ill-treatment by their partners.
     0   The project implementation agency has distinguished itself for its professionalism
         and for having survived after the project closed. It is also a well-accepted
         organization, and serves as an effective buffer from the political instability in the
         formulation of projects and programs for the judicial system.

4.     In Guatemala, the project development objective was to create a more effective,
accessible and credible judicial system that would foster public trust and confidence in it
and improve consistency and equity in the application of law. Overall, achievement of
development objective in Guatemala is considered to be substantial, according to results
deriving from a survey carried out in 2007.

     0   As regard judicial effectiveness, performance was limited. Only 18 percent of the
         users thought that cases took less time to complete than ten years prior. One
         small project component that dealt with the Office of Criminal Records was,
         however, very successful and is currently serving more than 600,000 users a year.
         Regarding judicial coverage, an increase took place not only in a generalized way,
         but also with a significant regional reallocation in favor of departments least well
         served by the justice system. There was also an increase in coverage per capita,
         and a favorable regional redistribution, targeting those regions that had the largest
         proportion of indigenous communities. In some regions, the components were
         extremely well-designed: this warrants their use as models by the World Bank for
         other countries initiating similar projects. Finally, the increase in the number of
         mediation centers has been steady, particularly since 2005, especially in provinces
         with a high proportion of indigenous groups, while the launching of mobile courts
         was a welcome initiative.
     0   Achievements toward a credible judicial system included a higher level of
         confidence of users in the justice system as well as a favorable perception about
         the performance of justice throughout the last ten years from internal and external
         users. In both groups a significant majority believed that the judiciary was
                                              ...
                                            Xlll



        working better than it did ten years before, mainly because of improved physical
        infrastructure, the way the courts are equipped, the quality of the system of
        criminal records, and the coverage of the courts. The survey concluded that
        credibility in the judiciary was higher today than a decade ago and that mobile
        courts have facilitated access to justice as well as decentralization in the
        administration of justice.
   0    Progress in ensuring that indigenous communities have access to state justice as
        well as recognition of indigenous systems of justice was good. Out of the
        82 mediators currently serving in Guatemala, 56 percent were women, and
        63 percent came from the indigenous communities. Almost two thirds of the
        centers were under the responsibility of indigenous mediators. The coordination
        of official justice and indigenous customary law is taking place, and progress has
        been made in the appointment of indigenous judges.

5.      In Colombia, the Bank-supported judicial project aimed to improve the rendering
by the judiciary branch of judicial conflict resolution services through: (i) a reduction in
processing time for case disposition; (ii) increased number of cases disposed per judge;
and (iii) increased satisfaction of users. Overall, performance in achieving development
objectives in Colombia is judged to be negligible.

   0    In the 1990s, there was huge congestion in the civil courts in Colombia due to an
        economic downturn that led to historical peaks in court foreclosures. To address
        this situation and the backlog in the judicial courts, drastic measures were taken in
        2003 and 2004, such as the reform of the Civil Procedure Code, and the creation
        of decongestion courts-none of these efforts was backed by the Bank project.
   0    By 2004, as the crisis came to an end, there was a major decrease in the load of
        court cases. There were some efficiency gains, but it is not possible to conclude
        that these were the result of actions undertaken under the Bank project.
    0   Three separate surveys provided the following feedback on the clearing of court
        cases in Colombia: (i) the majority of respondents of the 2005 and 2007 surveys
        thought that the time required to complete a case was longer than the time they
        thought to be normal, and the impact of the project was negligible, and when
        positive, it had been transitory; and (ii) the majority of respondents had no idea
        that a project for improving the civil courts had been implemented, and almost
        half of them considered the speed with which services are provided by the courts
        was deficient or at most fair.

Achievement of Development Outcomes

6.      Achievement of development objective is rated satisfactory for Guatemala and
Ecuador, and unsatisfactory for Colombia, as detailed below. The judicial project
implemented in Ecuador helped reduce court case load, but only in one province. The
program to help women's access to justice exceeded initial expectations and improved
access to justice for poor women in a sustainable manner. The mediation centers helped
to relieve the congestion and delays in the ordinary courts and people prefer them
because they settle disputes in a matter of weeks instead of months.
                                            xiv


7.     As regard Guatemala, there has been good progress in the recognition of
indigenous justice and a sustained coordination of the official justice system and the
indigenous customary law. The increased availability of courts in remote parts of the
country was a key step in increasing access to justice. In particular, the mediation centers
and the mobile courts have facilitated access to justice, as well as decentralization of the
administration of justice.

8.     In Colombia, however, performance of the Bank-supportedjudicial project was
weak. As noted, user surveys show that the time to complete cases is not perceived as
having fallen, that the impact of the project was negligible and transitory. Moreover, the
majority was not aware that the project had been implemented.

Risk to Development Outcome

9.       Because of the magnitude of the reforms, the Judiciary branch in Guatemala
assimilated the project well in institutional terms, and there is a perception of continuity
between the project coordination unit and the current Government's Unit for the
Modernization of the Judiciary. Another indication of sustainability of the project is that
some of the actions undertaken continue autonomously, and in some cases, without being
identified as having been initiated by the Bank. Risk to development outcome in
Guatemala is rated negligible.

10.     In Ecuador, several years after the project closed, Projusticia (which served as a
Project Implementation Unit [PIU]) is still recognized in the media as "the body
responsible for the modernization of the justice system, and the entity responsible for
coordinating the agenda between the Judiciary, the Executive, and Congress." The
consolidation of this coordination work to support the judicial system took the form of
the creation of the Ministry of Justice at the end of 2007. Both the first Minister of
Justice and the present one are former directors of Projusticia. Risk to development
outcome in Ecuador is rated modest.

11.     In Colombia, institutional memory was much more elusive. People asked about
the project responded that they were unsure if the project had formally closed, and no one
knew what had been achieved, what was missing, what had happened, and what, if
anything, was to continue. Risk to development outcome is rated significant.

Bank Performance

12.    Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory in both Guatemala and
Ecuador. In both countries, project design and objectives matched the Bank's strategy for
the country and the government's overall reform program. There were also broad ideas
about how performance indicators could be measured, but no baselines or target values
were specified. However, project supervision was lightly documented for the project in
Guatemala, while a flawed delivery of very expensive software in Ecuador was not
documented, despite the waste of money involved.

13.    In Colombia, the project deviated from the basic objectives of both the Bank's
strategy for the country and the government, which were to reduce violence and poverty,
while increasing access to justice-a critical element identified as a cause of violence. In
                                             xv

addition, project supervision was unfocused. Bank performance in the context of this
project is rated unsatisfactory.

Borrower Performance

14.     In both the Ecuador and the Guatemala project, preparation was done through a
lengthy and participatory process of discussion with stakeholders. This was a process that
was supported both by the government and the judiciary. The interest of the government
and of the judiciary in the objectives of their respective projects was maintained throughout
the execution. Also, there was adequate dissemination and continuation of the essence of
the project after it closed. In Colombia, by contrast, the government and its executing
agency showed little interest in the project. Not even the design was discussed with all the
relevant stakeholders. Important procedural reforms to the civil justice were carried out
during execution with no communication between the project, the government, the
legislature or the parties that were promoting those reforms. Borrower performance is rated
satisfactory for Ecuador and Guatemala, and unsatisfactory for Colombia.

Lessons and Recommendations

15. I  This PPAR suggests three broad lessons (see chapter 7). The first is that it is
important to adapt the objectives and design of the project to local law, conditions, and
peculiarities. The second lesson highlights the need for flexibility in overall approach in
the conception of the project. In addition, it is essential to solicit local knowledge as well
as input from specific beneficiaries in the process of selecting project objectives, design,
and implementation arrangements. The third lesson is that it is unwise to rely exclusively
on by-products of case management software to generate the data needed for adequate
monitoring and evaluation.

16.     The key recommendation for initiatives in judicial reform is that more resources
should be invested in identifjing local experts to give them a leading role in the design,
execution, and evaluation of projects. This will facilitate greater adaptation to the
specific conditions of each country, and ultimately ensure ownership and sustainability.

1. Background
 1.1      In the last two decades, most countries in Latin America have made efforts to renew or
modernize their judiciaries. Nearly one billion dollars have been invested.2 For the World
Bank ?the core of a judicial reform program typically consists of measures to strengthen the
judicial branch of government and related en ti tie^."^ These measures aim to: (i) make the
judicial branch independent or strengthen its independence; (ii) speed the processing of cases;
 (iii) increase access to dispute resolution mechanisms; and iv) professionalize the bench and
bar!

1.2     Judicial reform has been deemed necessary for both democracy and economic
development in Latin America.? For the World Bank, judicial reform ?is part of a larger effort
to make the legal systems in developing countries and transition economies more market
friendly., Judicial reform projects sponsored by the World Bank aim solely at enhancing a
nation?s economic performance.,y6

1.3    The rationale for World Bank support for legal and judicial reform as an ingredient to
promote economic growth and reduce poverty is relatively clear. One of the critical lessons of
the East Asian financial crisis and the collapse of some Eastern European transition
economies in the 1990s is that without the rule of law economic growth and poverty reduction
can be neither sustainable nor equitable. Furthermore ?the rule of law promotes economic
growth and reduces poverty by providing opportunity, empowerment, and security through
laws and legal institutions.? And,

        to engender investment and jobs, laws and legal institutions must provide an
        environment conducive to economic activity. This requires the entire legal sector to
        function effectively, transparently, and with due process. First and foremost, the
        judiciary must be independent, impartial, and effe~tive.~

 1.4    It is beyond the scope of this assessment to provide a full review of what the
development literature says about these causal links. It is worth noting, however, that there is
no consensus around these ideas. Almost everywhere in Latin America there persists a
marked ideological and political polarization with regard to the priorities, or the impact, of the
judicial system. This debate is associated with two major intellectual movements that have
influenced the reform processes. On the one hand, there is the already mentioned economic
approach to legal and judicial reform, that emphasizes the stabilizing and market fostering
qualities of the rule of law. On the other there is the neoconstitutionalist approach? that places
emphasis on equality and the expansion of civil, political and social rights. The relationship
between these two movements has been a complex one, but not always conflicting. Although

there have been some sharp controversies, the contemporar Latin American legal order
admits both neoliberal trends and the neoconstitutionalists. ry

1.5     The World Bank has often been considered the leader of the so called neoliberul
economic vision of law." Furthermore, the design of World Bank projects has not always
sought and integrated input from the many legal think tanks neither the non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) interested in judicial matters, nor the "global community of courts," in
particular the constitutional courts that have grown significantly since the 1990s.''

1.6     Another distinction has been relevant for judicial reform, and has central relevance in
this evaluation. The top down approach-macro-projects, designed and coordinated at
national level-as opposed to bottom up programs, based on municipal governments, local
organizations, and even individual judges committed to change and innovation. The top down
approach, which seems predominant in the Bank's judicial reform's efforts, has evolved into a
homogeneous model that tends to be promoted by international experts with scant
understanding of a client country's Law and peculiarities, contrary to local knowledge.

1.7     In all the countries where reforms were undertaken, the approaches selected have been
affected by the political context or supervening crisis.12 Also, there have been huge regional
differences in terms of success, even within a single country. It will become clear in this
assessment that some of the economic, political, and social situations particular to Ecuador,
Guatemala, and Colombia affected the performance of the reform projects and the judiciary.
Even within the countries themselves, local peculiarities were also determining factors.

1.8     In Guatemala, almost 40 years of armed conflict ended in 1996 with the signature of
the peace accords. Military confrontation had a serious effect on economic growth, social
services, and infrastructure. Guatemala had to reconstruct its economy, and build a state that
better reconciled the claims of the opposing groups involved in the conflict. Although the
nature of violence changed, it continued to be one of the most serious problems in that
country. Almost 40 percent of the population of Guatemala belongs to some 24 indigenous
groups, who retain their own language, customs, community organizations, and authorities.
These were the groups most affected by the armed conflict. Recognizing this, the peace
accords aimed to restore the rule of law, strengthen respect for human rights, and create a
more inclusive economic and social system. Judicial reform was included as an important
component, and the sector's reconstruction was considered to be essential to promote post-
conflict reconstruction, social stability, and economic growth. The Bank's judicial reform
program in Guatemala was hlly integrated into this national effort to reform, or rather to
rebuild the judiciary after the conflict. There was the additional challenge posed by traditional
law practices of the indigenous communities, and the Bank project covered such aspects.


 One example of this is the Colombian constitution of 1991, where clearly-defined territories have been drawn
for each of the two movements. The cost of this kind of arrangement has been internal consistency.
l o Dezalay and Garth (2002), De Sousa Santos and Garcia (2001), Santos (2006) sees this orthodox economic
view only as characteristic of the first wave of "structural adjustment" reforms in the early 199Os, with the later
Comprehensive Development Framework (CDF) being established came out precisely as a response to the
critiques of the neoliberal economic policies. He also challenges the assumption of consensus within the Bank
about the strategy and programs for development.
  According to Rodriguez (2009) the European financial support, especially from Germany, has been crucial in
the consolidation of this network.

 1.9 Despite levels of violence which have been similar to those of Guatemala, and
 sometimes worse, the Colombian situation cannot be considered a post-conflict scenario.
 Instead of a civil war, what has happened in Colombia is a confrontation among different
 illegal armed organizations and between them and the army. Major institutional changes,
 such as a new constitution-which was also the result of peace agreements with one of the
 guerrilla groups-had been introduced ten years before the project. The 1991 Constitution
 brought important changes to the judicial system. The main areas of this broad reform
 program were13 the protection of fundamental rights (Accidn de Tutela), alternative dispute
 resolution (ADR) mechanisms, the introduction of the adversarial criminal justice system,
 changes in military justice and in the "public order," jurisdiction and the creation of the
 Consejo Superior de la Judicatura (Higher Council of the Judiciary). The Bank-supported
 project did not deal with any of these issues.

 1.10 Lower levels of violence notwithstanding, Ecuador has suffered greater economic and
 political instability. Instead of an internal armed conflict there was a long border dispute with
 Peru and, recently, problems around the border with Colombia. The incidence of the
 indigenous population (25 percent) is lower than in Guatemala (48 percent) and well above
 that in Colombia (1.7 per~ent).'~    Judicial reform efforts began in Ecuador in the early 1990s
 as part of a state modernization agenda. The Bank had a leading role, both in the assessment
 of the judiciary" and in advising on the design of the national judicial reform program.16

 1.I 1 Common to all three countries is the extreme geographic heterogeneity, not only in
 terms of a large gap in living standards between urban and rural areas, but also in terms of
 significant economic, social, and cultural differences across regions. This high heterogeneity
 translates into regional differences in terms of legal disputes and their resolution. Thus, the
 idea of judicial reform designed and implemented in a uniform way at the national level
 becomes risky. High levels of poverty make the issue of access to justice highly relevant. In
 addition, in all three countries, some regions show strong influence of drug trafficking and
 violence, leading to criminal justice having a priority in country-owned judicial reform
 efforts.

2. Framework for the evaluation^^
2.1     Several years after completion of the projects, there is still no consensus about the
relevant theoretical model for judicial reform. Impact measurement and evaluation
                                                             '*
methodologies are still relatively underdeveloped. World Bank documents dated 2003
provide a sketch of a judicial reform model. The legal and judicial reform strategy is based on
three pillars: (i) an independent, impartial, and effective judiciary; (ii) an ap ropriate legal
framework that provides enforceable rights to all; and (iii) access to justice.             E
2.2     This framework, however, was not explicitly stated when the three projects covered in
this assessment were designed. At the time-1996 for Ecuador, 1998 for Guatemala, and
2001 for Colombia+mphasis was placed on to effectiveness of the judiciary and, in two of
the projects, access to justice.

2.3     To enhance effectiveness, Bank support was mostly aimed at judicial administrative
reform, including software development. A significant part of the budget (19 percent in
Ecuador, 33 percent in Guatemala, and 35 percent in Colombia) was invested in physical
construction (or remodeling) of infrastructure. Construction of better infrastructure was
considered a way to improve access to justice or (mostly in Colombia) to improve
effectiveness. Alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms were thought to facilitate
access but also to increase overall effectiveness of the judiciary, integrated broadly.

3. Objectives and Components
3.1    The objectives of the projects as stated in the respective loan agreements are outlined
below.

3.2     Ecuador. "The overarching goal of the Bank project would be to improve the
capacity of the judicial system by strengthening the administration of justice. Specifically,
the proposed project aims at: increasing efficiency, effectiveness and transparency in the
judicial process by improving case administration procedures; improving the infrastructure,
expanding the use of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms within the court system;
improving the access to justice by the public and women in particular; and improving court
reform and research and legal education."20

3.3    Guatemala. "The development objective of the project is to create a more effective,
accessible and credible judicial system that would foster public trust and confidence in it and
improve consistency and equity in the application of law."21

3.4      Colombia. "The proposed Project constitutes the learning phase of a long-term
initiative undertaken by the Government of Colombia, under the leadership of the [Superior
Council of the Judicature] SCJ, aimed at improving the rendering by the Judiciary of judicial
conflict resolution services. It is expected that the proposed Project will allow the testing of a
participatory and comprehensive organizational change strategy to bring about change in the
courts' operations which ensure people swifter, fairer and more transparent conflict
resolution services.9y22

3.6      In Ecuador, the Case Administration and Information Support component (A) was
conceived to help address the overall goal of improving the management of cases. The
Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) component (B) sought to reduce the backlogs and
costs of litigation and also to improve fairness and effectiveness through mediation. The
Program for Law and Justice component (C) was intended to provide a mechanism to
research and implement activities needed to prepare a judicial reform program throughout the
country. The Infrastructure component (D) was a way to begin improving the infkastructure
of the courts by developing a national strategy for courthouse facility development, by
remodeling a building purchased by the judicial branch, and by creating pilot decentralized
facilities in Guayaquil and Quito. Finally, the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) and Fund
Management component (E) paid for project coordination and implementation, and it
supported the establishment of a permanent PCU, Projusticia.

3.7     In Guatemala, the role of the Institutional Capacity of the Judiciary component (A)
was to improve management procedures. The Anticorruption Support component (B) sought
prevention and control of corruption. The Access to Justice component (C) was to help reach
various goals. The first was to improve knowledge for policy making. Second, was to pilot-
test the use of mediation mechanisms. Third, was to improve the performance of justices of
the peace (JPs) in rural areas. And fourth, was to expand the judicial infkastructure. The
Communications, Modernization, and Management component (D) sought to improve
communications, to support the Judiciary Branch Modernization Commission, and to
strengthen the PCU.

3.8    In Colombia, the Change Strategies component (A) was intended to generate
"notable improvements in the expediency and quality in the provision of conflict resolution
                                                             The
services and in the productivity of judicial resource use.y926 Appropriate Policy and
Support Environment component (B) looked for the development of an appropriate policy
and support environment for the proposed change strategy. Finally, component (C) dealt
with Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation.

3.9     In Ecuador, the credit was disbursed fully, and there were minor revisions in project
component^.^^   The delay for the implementation of the project was negligible. In
Guatemala, there were no revisions to the components. However, the closing date was
extended three times, mainly because of delays in construction dates. In Colombia, the
project was not restructured and no changes were made to the design. Project
implementation was subject to "sporadic delays in procurement and disbursement."28
Implementation took twelve months more than expected. Some minor adjustments were
made in the allocation of funds.

4. Relevance of Objectives and Design
Relevance of Objectives
4.1    The relevance of project objectives was assessed using two criteria: (i) consistency
with the Bank's country assistance strategy; and (ii) consistency with government priorities
and policies.

4.2      In Ecuador, the project was appropriately framed within an effort to consolidate
markets, modernize the public sector, and make justice more accessible and effective. The
objectives were consistent with both the Bank strategy for the country and government
priorities. In the country assistance strategy (CAS) for 1996, the poor performance ofjustice
was recognized to be an obstacle to progress. A careful study of the Ecuadorian judicial
system had identified major constraints to the proper workings ofjustice and access to those
services by the most vulnerable groups. However, modernization of the public sector and the
judiciary had been an explicit policy in Ecuador since the early 1990s. Project objectives
remained relevant through the closing year of the project: "awareness has grown in the legal
and judicial community about the need for an effective, efficient, and transparent legal and
judicial system."29

4.3     In Guatemala, a national program for judicial reform was undertaken as follow-up of
the peace accords, which ended nearly 40 years of armed conflict. The Bank-supported
project was part of this global program to reform the judiciary. Because of the link with the
peace accords and the ensuing reforms, the project likely had more political than juridical or
technical significance. It was a reconstruction, and in some rural areas the creation, of a
judicial system in a post-conflict scenario. The objectives announced for justice-
effectiveness, accessibility, and credibility-were adopted by the project, and were relevant
to both the situation and for the Bank`s strategy to contribute to the reconstruction. Another
essential component of the peace accords was a strengthening of local power, taking account
of the characteristics and cultural practices of the local community. The objectives of the
project were consistent with the strengthening of local authorities and inclusion of indigenous
communities. As stated in the 2005 CAS, objectives remained consistent with the
government development priorities as of project closing.30

4.4     It should be noted that the Guatemalan project deliberately and correctly omitted
certain objectives. What has typically featured in Bank initiatives for judicial reform, the
need to strengthen markets, was not mentioned in this case. In an ideologically fragmented
environment such as Guatemala, that decision facilitated the acceptance of the project.

4.5     By the late nineties, when the Colombia project was designed, two overarching
development objectives were poverty reduction and the search for peace, both were at the
center of the government's development plan and the Bank's country assistance ~trategy.~'
The Bank was complementing government programs aimed at reducing violence, especially
through support for a proactive social policy and investment in high-conflict areas. It was
believed that the failure of the judiciary to provide an adequate system for conflict resolution

contributed to violence. Access to justice was identified as a key issue by the government
and was consistent with country assistance strategy priorities. However, the project did not
directly address the problem of access. It concentrated on issues related to judicial
performance and the reduction of the backlog in the civil circuit courts. For various reasons,
this concentration reduced the relevance of the project objectives. First, the project appraisal
document itself points out that in 1999 the congestion in the civil courts had been reduced by
more than 30 percent, and that there was no clear reason why this reduction should have
occurred. Secondly, by that time it had become clear that the largest part of the burden on the
Colombian civil courts was financial institutions' actions to recover bad loans.32 Thirdly, the
deteriorating macroeconomic situation and, in particular, the emerging financial crisis
suggested that there was soon to be an avalanche of new court cases.

4.6     At the time the project came to an end, the critical problems indicated in the previous
CAS and overlooked by the project-violence and poverty-were still much alive. Further,
the most serious expression of these two phenomena, internally displaced persons (Zos
desplazados) headed the agenda of concerns for the Bank and for the government.
Nevertheless, the idea of a causal link between access to justice and violence was abandoned
by the project. The problems of the non-criminal justice system were focused on issues such
as "procedures related to credit and financial              Interestingly enough, these issues,
particularly access to justice, loom large in a new Bank-supported judicial project in
Colombia.34

Relevance of Design
4.7     In terms of design of the project, the evaluation assessed: (i) whether the strategy
underpinning the project was based on a sound analysis of the country context, (ii) whether
the project design indicated a clear results fiamework linking proposed activities to desired
objectives; (iii) to what extent exogenous factors were identified and addressed; and (iv) to
what extent the performance monitoring and evaluation system was consistent with project
objectives.

4.8      Overall, the evaluation finds that the three projects failed in terms of (ii) and (iv).
Even when objectives were realistic, the lack of a clear results fiamework underlying the
projects led to weak linkages between the objectives and the proposed activities. These links
were not always explicit or evident in the preliminary project documents. The clearest
illustration of this flaw relates to construction and remodeling. These components received
an important allocation of funds in the three projects, but the discussion regarding expected
outcome or impact is missing in the program documents. In all three projects, the proposed
set of actions did not typically result from a logical chain linking objectives and activities.
The links between actions and objectives appeared almost intuitive.

4.9     The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system in all three projects was ill-conceived.
It did not adequately reflect project objectives and failed to take proper account of the
financial weight of the components. The M&E system accorded excessive relevance to a
limited set of indicators based on court statistics that took it for granted that the software
components would yield optimal results and, as a result, were inadequate to detect flaws in

the software or of the other components when the software did not operate as well as
expected.

4.10 In both the Ecuador and Guatemala projects, a portion of the k n d s was left to be
allocated using a participatory process that defined certain specific actions. In these cases,
there was a clear tension between grass-roots participation in the design and the internal
coherence of the project.

4.1 1 In Ecuador, the strategy underlying the project was based on a detailed prior
assessment carried out by the Bank. The staff appraisal report (SAR) identified institutional
and political risks to the project. The financial crisis, which ultimately had an impact on
project implementation, was not raised, although this would clearly have been difficult to
anticipate. The design had two good features. First, the project tried to combine standard
elements for facilitating economic growth, such as increasing effectiveness, with components
that directly promote access and enhance the rights of the most vulnerable groups, such as
legal aid for poor women. Second, the project had limited scope, with objectives that were
realistic, and analytical work was undertaken by the Bank that fed into the design of the
project. There were also some limitations. First, the links between the objectives and some
of the activities were weak. Second, the design emphasized the importance of administration,
organization, and software to reduce processing times, whereas the judicial assessment had
identified issues of legal procedure as the main reason for delays. In particular, insufficient
attention was paid to the general application of oral proceedings as these are meant to work
under Ecuadoran Law. Third, the design overlooked regional differences in the workings of
the system. Moreover, the project chose as first pilot tests for the new model courts the cities
with the worst problems and greatest congestion, instead of going for "low-hanging-fruit"
cities where the learning curve would have been less steep.

4.12 In Guatemala, the final design was the result of exhaustive consultations with all
relevant stakeholders. As the ICR put it, "Project preparation was exemplary." There were
some limitations on project design that arose as a result of the political, negotiated nature of
the peace accords as well as the participatory nature of the process for defining objectives in
a multiethnic and multicultural society with different traditional legal systems. There was a
trade-off between democratic participation to satisfy the demands of different groups
previously in armed conflict with one another and overall cohesion and consistency of the
framework underlying the accords. In addition, exogenous political risks of the project were
anticipated and addressed. In particular, despite the weighty presence of the criminal
jurisdiction in the overall program for the modernization of justice, the Bank was only
marginally involved in this area. Even knowing that the Bank's support could be criticized on
                  the
these ground~,~' decision remained to play a small role in the area of criminal justice.

4.13 For Colombia, the strategic underpinnings of the project and some crucial
assumptions were not based on a sound and systematic assessment of the country context at
that time. There was no evidence, for example, on the tacitly-assumed link between
performance of the civil courts and poverty alleviation, or violence reduction, two key
                                                                                         ~~
elements that would have anchored the project within the country's p r i ~ r i t i e s .From the
perspective of poverty reduction, the relevance of Bank support for enhancing the speed of

Government's development plan and the Bank's country assistance strategy.

process in civil cases, mostly for debt recovery, that were initiated by financial conglomerates
against households that were in arrears on their mortgages because of the crisis, was limited
at best. Even from an exclusively economic viewpoint, it can be argued that the project was
wrongly focused. From the mid-1990s there was a large volume of literature on the costs of
violence, which demonstrated the enormous economic impact of the armed conflict. Taking
it as given that the Bank could do little directly with regard to the conflict, this evaluation
was unable to locate within the literature and ESW of that time any authoritative references
highlighting the operation of the civil courts or the non-performing loans in the financial
system as basic obstacles to growth in Colombia. A hrther factor that appears to have been
overlooked in assessing the country context and the significant exogenous factors relates to
the cursory manner in which project design took account of the impact of the financial crisis
in the late 1990s on the courts, as well as the decisions by the Constitutional Court or the
government's other efforts to address the judicial backlog.37

4.14 Based on the foregoing discussion, the assessment has determined ratings as follows:
For Ecuador, this assessment rates the relevance of the project's objectives as Substantial.
For Guatemala, this assessment rates the relevance of the project's objectives as High. For
Colombia, this assessment rates the relevance of the project's objectives as Negligible.




37 Rather than address these contextual issues directly, the PAD noted that "A key technical issue dealt during
the process of project preparation was the room provided by the existing legislative framework to undertake the
proposed changes in case management. After thorough analysis it was concluded that the current legislative
framework has been systematically misapplied by judges that rather than active directors of proceedings have
chosen to assume a wait and see attitude until the stage of deciding the case. ... In fact, the project can be
portrayed (sic) as an attempt to set right the use of the law." World Bank (2001), p. 20.

5. Achievement of Objectives (Efficacy)
5.1     This section examines, for each country, the realized outcomes in relation to the
objectives established in the projects. The section ends with a discussion of the software
development component, common to the three projects, which showed similar issues in all
cases in terms of efficacy.

Ecuador
5.2        Project objectives in Ecuador were:

       0   Increased efficiency, effectiveness, and transparency in the judicial process;
       0   Expanded use of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms within the court
           system;
       0   Improved access to justice by the public, in general, and women, in particular; and
       0   Foster initiatives on court reform, legal research, and education.

         EFFECTIVENESS TRANSPARENCY JUDICIAL
EFFICIENCY,        AND           IN THE    PROCESS

5.3     One of the sub-objectives of the reform in Ecuador was to reduce the workload of
pending cases and the length of time taken to clear them. The basic assumption for the
corresponding component was that "case management and information technology is
significantly correlated to the time needed to resolve a case."38 One tool for improving
effectiveness was the Corporative Court Model (CCM) in which management tasks are
separated from judicial activities. This component, which began with a pilot phase in courts
in Quito and Cuenca, was extended to courts in Guayaquil in a second phase.

5.4     In terms of effectiveness, the project showed different degrees of success in different
places. In the city of Cuenca, the CCM was adopted in civil cases and extended to other
jurisdictions. Several of the judges believe that rather than being followers of some foreign
model, they were the true managers and promoters of this initiative, which separates judicial
from administrative functions. The impact of the CCM in the reduction of pending cases is
not conclusive (see para 5.8) but at least the data for such an evaluation is available in this
city. In addition, the CCM is considered to be useful in rationalizing management, human
resources allocation and even the quality of judicial decisions. Another pioneering
improvement in effectiveness, also from Cuenca, is that some legal shortcuts were found to
adopt oral procedures in criminal cases.

5.5    In Quito, for no apparent reason, the judges were opposed to the implementation of
the CCM, and even to the related remodeling. In Guayaquil a quite peculiar and hybrid court
model was implemented. In both cities, the data to evaluate the impact of the project on
pending cases is not publicly available.

5.6    In terms of effectiveness, both the ICR and the Ecuadorian Government - Contraloria
General del Estado (CGE) made favorable evaluations that require a few comments. First,
they do not allow for a long-term or even medium-term perspective on the outcomes.
Second, these evaluations do not distinguish between the courts in which the CCM was
implemented, and those in which it was not.

5.7      An outlook over a longer period, based on judicial data from Cuenca, the most
reliable in Ecuador, and the only city for which information is publicly available, shows that
the impact of the project in terms of efficiency was slight and, above all, tran~itory.~' In
effect, even before the execution of the project in Cuenca properly began, one performance
indicator-the proportion of cases completed in relation to new cases-had already reached
levels observed today, close to 90 percent. Most of the supposed greater efficiency was seen,
for all civil courts in Cuenca, between 2000 and 2004. In 2000, the number of cases
completed was almost three times the number of new cases. In the following years, the ratio
is almost two to one, and for 2005 it is close to the target of 100 percent (Figure 1). These
five years of good performance by the judiciary may be attributed to the reform. However, it
also had to do with the process of clearing up the backlog of dormant case files with the help
of law students, which began in Cuenca in 2000. This program also contributed very
significantly to the increased efficiency.40

  5.8     Further, neither of these evaluations-ICR or CGE-mention a continuous and
  significant fall in the number of new cases entering the civil jurisdiction. This exogenous
,trend was not only significant-almost 40 percent between 1998 and 2001-but was also
  bound to affect the performance of the courts.

 5.9     It is important to take account of the link between the financial crisis and dollarization
 of the Ecuadorian economy on the one hand, and the new incoming cases to the civil courts
 and the capacity to process them on the other. Financial crises are typically associated with a
 marked increase in the volume of cases entering the civil court system, and Ecuador was no
 exception. There is no available information regarding the impact of this crisis on the
 administration of justice, but there is relevant evidence that the link was there. One
 stakeholder interviewed 41 estimates that, nationwide, the crisis generated 40 to 50 thousand

    extra cases for the judicial system. That amount is close to the number of new cases arriving
    in a single year in a large city such as Guayaquil. A civil judge in Cuenca estimates that the
    workload increased by 20 percent as a consequence of the crisis. The matter was not only
    one of quantity, but also of the monetary value of the claims involved, and many of the cases
    are still being processed. Several of the enforcement proceedings promoted by a financial
    institution, the Corporucidn Finuncieru Nucionul in Guayaquil, were worth close to
    US$10 million, having to be seen by higher level civil courts. After being solved on a first
.   instance, some of those cases ended up back in the courts in appeals, exceptions, or even
    claims for damages. Thus, an important part of the unexplained decline in the number of new
    cases arriving at the civil courts with the change of century, and the consequent increase in
    the efficiency of the courts, seems to be related to the unwinding of Ecuador's financial
    crisis.

    5.10 A good example of the local idiosyncrasies in Ecuador, and of the lack of a uniform
    model of judicial reform, is the physical design for the CCM in Guayaquil. Implicit in the
    CCM is an architectural design in which the spaces of the administrative personnel and the
    judge are kept separate. In that city one way to enhance transparency in the judicial process
    was through physical changes to the layout of courthouses. The judge's chambers adjoin a
    corridor, from which they are separated by large panes of glass, which allow anyone passing
    to observe all that is happening inside the court. "This guarantees the transparency of
    process," says the Council of Judicature representative in Guayaquil. For him, this
    architectural detail has been fundamental in the eradication of what he describes as frequent
    "arrangements" and cases of corruption, which, according to him, happened before this
    reform. Convinced that judicial transparency is today founded in part on physical visibility,
    one of the pending ideas is the installation of video cameras in the courts. Its originality
    notwithstanding, this hypothesis concerning the underlying drivers of corruption and what is
    needed to control it, based on physical transparency in the courts, is as difficult to verify as it
    is to try to convince the representative in question of its possible limitations. Regardless, the
    hypothesis of visual surveillance has been put into practice in Guayaquil for both the judges
    and the rest of the staff. In a hybrid version of the CCM, staff is still being assigned to a
     single court, each working for a single judge, but they all work in the same physical space,
    with each in effect looking over each other's shoulder. This "transparency by design"
    hypothesis has been applied only in Guayaquil.

                  RESOLUTION
            DISPUTE
    ALTERNATIVE            MECHANISMS

    5.1 1 The promotion of mediation and ADR was an important objective in the project in
    Ecuador.42Although much progress remains to be made, indications are that achievements
    have been significant. Today, there are some 120 mediation               attached to a wide
    range of organizations (superintendents, universities, chambers of commerce, NGOs,
    foundations, lawyers' associations, and professional association^).^^ Many of them are not
    part of the formal judicial branch. The demand for establishing new centers, which depend
    on approval by the judiciary, has grown steadily due to the greater trust that people have in
    decisions that have judicial backing. The workload of the centers varies, as is the nature of

    42The decision to use an ADR instead of a court is typically made by the parties to a contract at the time they
    agree on that contract. The ADR usually becomes a first instance, which, in any case, can be appealed before
    the courts.

the cases they deal with. In Cuenca, the mediation center attached to the judiciary currently
handles some 7,000 cases a year. That amount is five times the number served in Guayaquil,
and twice that of Quito. ?The people of this region (Cuenca) are more open to dialogue,
readier to sit down and talk, and arrive at a sound agreement.? This observation would apply
to the users as well as to the judges and lawyers. In Cuenca, the courts send so many cases to
the centers that they are now reaching their capacity limit. In Quito and Guayaquil, by
contrast, the courts continue to mistrust the mediation centers. While in Quito only 5 percent
of cases had been sent in by the ordinary courts, in Cuenca, for several years, the number of
cases was split quite equally between those referred by the courts and those brought
voluntarily. Today, the proportion of court-referred cases is larger. In recent years, the
number of cases handled by the Quito Mediation Center has grown (Figure 2). Although
there is no baseline to which the results attained can be compared, this trend should be
considered a successful achievement of the project.

5.12 The mediation centers have brought relief to congestion and delays in the ordinary
courts. For Family Law disputes in Quito, for example, the excessive workload has meant
that court hearings are being scheduled more than a year in advance. This has meant an
increase in the number of requests for mediation in the area of family and childhood, which
has doubled in two years.45 In Cuenca, people prefer the mediation centers because they
settle disputes in two weeks, while courts do so in eight months. As a result, the centers are
receiving requests for mediation even from Ecuadorians that have migrated to Spain.

5.13 Judges, lawyers, and court staff are still cautious about mediation. Aside from
cultural considerations, there may be peculiarities of Ecuadoran Procedural Law that remain
to be addressed properly. This said, one litigation lawyer in Guayaquil, who charges on a per-
case-solved basis, thinks mediation may be good business because it is quicker and therefore
allows a larger number of cases to be accepted. Hence, despite the lack of aggregate
information and the difficulties that mediation still faces, this evaluation concludes that the
mediation centers are now on firm ground.

IMPROVING THE ACCESS JUSTICE WOMEN
                   TO      BY

5.14 Legal aid for poor women is the star component, not only in the Ecuadorian project
but perhaps in all the initiatives fop legal and judicial reform initiated by the Bank in Latin
America. It is an intervention that, despite its small size, has received much attention within
the Bank and outside of it. It is not easy to find a program for judicial reform that has been
so exhaustively and rigorously e ~ a l u a t e d . ~ ~

5.15 The project directly targeted poor women who were victims of domestic violence or
who were seeking child support. Local NGOs competed to provide legal aid and other types
of support in specialized centers. AAer the project was completed, a detailed evaluation, with
field work, interviews, and focus groups, all done with the assistance of local NGOs, showed
that "women who used the legal aid centers are better off legally, economically, and
subjectively, as reflected in qualitative and quantitative measures. Participation in the legal
clinics increases the probability of receiving child support payments, decreases the incidence
of domestic violence after separation, and is associated with a more positive outlook toward
                         In
the judicial sy~tem."~' addition, these achievements were consistent with specific
objectives of the Bank: "reduction of poverty, empowerment of women, and the promotion of
education."48

5.16 The program not only exceeded initial expectations with regard to the number of users
and seryices offered but it also improved access to justice for poor women in a sustainable
manner. In fact, in one of the regions where the program was implemented, there is recent
evidence of an eventual long-term impact beyond the period of execution of the project. A
survey made in 2008, representative of the population of the cantdn (province) of Cuenca, finds
that "the great majority of women consulted (98 percent) are aware of the existence of these
[services]" (Women and Family Commissioners). When the women were asked whether, in the
face of a potentially violent situation, they would go to the CMF or not, "92.4 percent said that
they would, 63.5 percent considered that these [services] had helped to reduce ill treatment by
their partners.'" In other words, the seed sowed and financially supported by the project has
borne fiuit. The positive impact was not limited to program users, but extended to nearly the
entire female population of Cuenca. Unfortunately, however, the financial situation of the
NGOs committed to providing legal aid for poor women is now rather fragile.

IMPROVING COURT REFORM AND RESEARCH AND LEGAL

5.17 The purpose of the Fund for Law and Justice was to promote the participation of civil
society and judicial operators in the process of judicial reform, with small programs that
would facilitate the access to justice, and help deepen the.diagnosis. The Fund for Civil
Society financed 22 projects, with an average value of $40,000 each, and a maximum of
$84,000 each."

5.18 One undoubtedly successfd achievement in Ecuador was to have channeled the
execution of the project through Projusticia, an entity which has distinguished itself for its

continuity and professionalism. Projusticia has been a well-accepted organization, which
maintains fluent communication with a range of actors: the judges, the Council of the
Judicature, and, on the other side, the Executive, the academic world, NGOs, and litigants.
As a technical entity, it has been an effective buffer from the impact of political instability in
the formulation of projects and programs for the judicial system.

5.19 The early alliance of Projusticia with the Asociacidn Ecuatoriana de Facultades de
Jurisprudencia (Association of Law Schools) led to an improvement in the research on
judicial issues and also to several changes in legal ed~cation.~'

5.20 In short, for Ecuador, although the main objective (reduction of case load) of the
largest component appears to have only been achieved in Cuenca, the objective of increasing
access to justice through alternate dispute resolution mechanisms and through the smaller
components was fully achieved. Overall, the efficacy of the project is assessed to be
substantial.

Guatemala
5.21        Project objectives in Guatemala were to improve the judicial system's:
       0    effectiveness;
       0    accessibility;
       0    credibility; and
       0    consistency and equity in the application of the Law.

EFFECTIVENESS

5.22 Although one of the objectives of the project in Guatemala was to create a more
effective judicial system, no specific targets were set. The most commonly used indicators
for effectiveness-delay, clearance and congestion rates-were not tracked, but the project
documents, quite realistically, never pretended that the project would do

5.23 For the period 2003-2006, ASIES (2006) estimates a disposition rate of 10 percent
and points out that the rate fell from 13 percent to 7 percent during that period. This study
does not specify, however, that between 1999 and 2002 the rate was much higher in civil and
labor courts, and much lower in criminal courts (Figure 3). The high variation in the number
of incoming and outgoing cases is not mentioned, let alone explained. For aggregate efficacy
indicators, the only conclusion that can be drawn seems to be that reliable judicial statistics
are still not available.




'I   Estrella (2001).
'' The clearance rate is the ratio of the number of cases disposed of during the period to the number of cases
filed during that same period. The disposition rate is the average speed of the resolution of a case. The delay
rate is the average time taken for the resolution of a case. Finally the congestion rate is a measure of how the
stock unresolved case evolves in a court system.

                               Source: Data from CENADOJ taken from ASIES (2003,2006)

5.24 In terms of delays, there is no systematic analysis done so far. Again, no performance
indicator was proposed in the project appraisal document. With the adoption of oral
proceedings in family and labor courts, there are some signs of a reduction in the time from
filling to disposition in both areas.53 In some civil trials, a smaller number of routines have
also led to a reduction in the time needed to solve a case.54 However, in a 2007 survey of
users, only 18 percent of them thought that cases took less time to complete than ten years
before.55

5.25 Although designed more as mechanisms to improve access to justice, one may
consider that the higher coverage achieved by both Juzgados de Puz (Peace Courts) and
mediation centers has meant an advance in terms of effectiveness-some cases that never
reached the system are now settled by the judiciary.

5.26 From the standpoint of effectiveness, it is worth noting a small Guatemalan project
component, the Antecedentes Penales. For this program, an in-depth assessment has not been
made, but it could and should be done. In any event, a quick review of available information
suggests that it has made a difference.

5.27 As part of the court support services, the Unidad de Antecedentes Penales (UCP,
Office of Criminal Records) is the office that issues the legal situation certificate that citizens
need to produce when applying for a job, a passport, a visa, a residence permit, or when they
want to work abroad. There are no accurate estimates of the costs incurred by users in terms
of time lost from work and travel to Guatemala City before the program was in place.
Informal consultations suggest that this process could last up to a week, implying
considerable costs for the users. An additional ill was the bad perceptions of justice
associated with a slow, cumbersome and ineffective procedure just to certify that someone
was free of legal problems. With the reform, the UCP is currently serving more than 600,000

users a year.56 As trivial as this may seem, the rationalization, streamlining, and
modernization of the delivery of a certificate required by law to over half a million people
each year is no less important as a priority than to have a payroll registry for the judiciary, or
a functional system of judicial ~tatistics.~'   Also, for many Guatemalans, obtaining this
certificate is the first contact with the justice system. It is conceivable that, as such, it will be
a determinant of the perception and image that people will have of the judiciary.

ACCESS JUSTICE
     TO

5.28 The expansion of the judicial system in recent years has been considerable. The
number of courts in Guatemala increased from 367 in 1987, to 583 in 2006. In national
terms, there were 3.9 courts per 100,000 people in 1987; in 2006 the number climbed to
4.6 courts for every 100,000. This increased coverage occurred not only in a generalized
way, but also with a significant regional re-composition in favor of the departments
(provinces) which were least well served by the justice system (Figure 4).

                  Figure 4. Guatemala: Number of Courts (per 100,000 people)
                                 by Department, 1987 and 2006




5.29 In 1997, the Department of Guatemala with less than 23 percent of the population was
home to almost 30 percent of the courts. By 2006, its share in the total number of courts was
equivalent to that of its population. In 1987, the ratio of the number of courts per capita in
the best-attended department (El Progreso) and the worst (Totonicapcin)was 1 to 5. In 2006,
the ratio between the two extremes was only 1 to 3. The calculation of the GIN1
coefficient-an indicator of economic inequality- for the provincial distribution of the

courts indicates it was halved. The dynamics were similar for the Peace C o u r t s t h e number
increased from 229 in 1987 to 365 in 2006. There was also an increase in per capita terms,
and a favorable regional redistribution. Furthermore, the provinces in which coverage most
increased were those that had the largest proportion of indigenous communities.

5.30 Special note should be taken of the fact that the new buildings have been accepted by
such a diverse population. This acceptance is not accidental because clear efforts were made
to adapt them to the ethnic and cultural peculiarities of the various regions. The architect
responsible for supervising the building designs had previous experience in micro planning,
regionalization, and decentralization. He was trained to take a local view of problems and
solutions. He had also worked with communities in the Peace Secretariat, on matters of mini-
management, and had sat at the negotiating tables: "The community way of thinking was not
alien to me." The land where the courts were built was allotted by the municipalities. This
process allowed discussions of schemes, designs, and plans with the local authorities. In
Palencia, Dutch funds were used to make the first model court. This initial design, although
assisted by an external consultant, had important local inputs. With this experience,
evaluation began from the contact of "the architectural part with the ethnic part." The same
exercise then took place also with the courts in PetCn and afterwards in the provincial
complex of Huehuetenango. In parallel, progress was made on the design for
Quetzaltenango. The court buildings in Guatemala, therefore, were not uniform; "they have
very few common characteristics, because they are a response to their different sites." The
critical question was "how to ensure that the buildings would be accepted by the local people.
 [The answer was] not to produce a foreign building. We had to avoid rejection by the
communities. Coverage is not only providing a service, but also ensuring that it is accepted."

5.3 1 Success was evident in this dimension. Some excerpts from the 2002 visit report by
Gerald Thacker, an international expert on judicial infrastructure, are telling.58 "The projects
in Huehuetenango and Quetzaltenango and in PetCn are extremely well-designed, and contain
many features that should be duplicated in other similar projects. The quality of the projects I
saw in Guatemala warrants their use as models by the World Bank for other countries
initiating similar projects (for example, the Philippines). The projects I saw are so well done
that a fuller documentation of them would serve as a wonderful resource for similar projects
in other countries. In that regard, I will discuss with faculty at the Georgia Institute of
Technology, College of Architecture the possibility of documenting representative projects
from the Guatemalan               Although the comments are positive, it is regrettable that
Thacker seemed to be missing the relevance and significance of the regional adaptation effort
made by Guatemala.

5.32 . Promotion of ADR mechanisms was a key element in the design of the project in
terms of access. As part of the diversification of judicial services and the reorganization of
the Peace Courts, the project included the design, creation, and operation of an ADR unit, and
a pilot program for mediation in civil, commercial, family and labor matters in the lower
courts of Guatemala City.6o The increase in the number of mediation centers has been steady,
particularly since 2005. Furthermore, the increase has been more important in the provinces,

such as Alta Verapaz, Quetzaltenango, and SuchitepCquez,with a high proportion of
indigenous groups.61

5.33 Between January and December 2008, these centers handled some 15,000 cases, two
thirds of which were voluntary (compared with 17.5 percent of cases referred by the ordinary
courts, and 13.7 percent of cases derived). By area of law, the highest percentage was civil
cases (57 percent), followed by family (23 percent), criminal (16 percent), commercial (3
percent), and labor (1 percent).

5.34 The interviews with the judges in one of the remotest zones of Guatemala, PetCn,
suggest that the initiative of the mobile courts can be considered a success for two reasons.
For one thing, the initiative lasted longer than the term of the project, and was adopted by the
judicial system to be extended to regions other than those where the two pilot tests were
conducted (Guatemala and Quetzaltenango).62 For another, judges of the remotest areas
perceive this as an ideal-and perhaps the only-solution, to the problem of access to justice
and the large territories, which are geographically and economically remote.

5.35 It seems clear that the mobile courts have facilitated access to justice. Between May
2003, when they opened, and December 2007, the two mobile courts in the pilot exercise
served 5,697 users, that is, an average of 610 users per mobile court, per year. Although the
number appears low, it exceeds the 4 12 persons served on average in each of the
73 mediation centers in 2007. In both cases, these are the initial years of new forms of access
to justice, which will undoubtedly require more time to consolidate.

5.36 The mobile courts also contributed to the objective of decentralizing the
administration of justice. Both for access and for decentralization, these are a less expensive
alternative than the construction of Peace Court buildings in each locality. Furthermore, they
can be used to estimate the demand for justice in certain places, and hence, as a mechanism
of ?trial and error,? facilitating the planning of infrastructure investment. In the two mobile
courts in the pilot scheme, the regional differences in types of cases and in users served
between 2003 and 2007 were ~ u b s t a n t i a l . ~ ~

         JUDICIAL
A CREDIBLE      SYSTEM

5.37 The suggested key performance indicator for credibility in the judiciary was an
?increase in user confidence.? No baseline value was set for this indicator. Several surveys
have been undertaken but they are not always comparable. Between 1997 and 2003, the
?perception of the performance of the judiciary has not changed. Its situation in terms of
external image remains weak in the

5.38 Another survey was carried out in 2007 among users ofthe judicial system,65asking
about their confidence. In a range from 0 ?I do not trust? to 10 ?I trust very much? the
average rating for the Orgunismo Judicial (the Judiciary) was 5. About half of the users

(46 percent) reported medium levels of confidence (4 to 6 in the scale), and those who
reported high confidence more than doubled those who had low confidence: 37.9 percent of
ratings were between 7 and 10 versus 15.5 percent between 0 and 3 in the scale. Even with
no previous benchmark for comparisons these results look acceptable in terms of credibility.

5.39 In the same 2007 survey, a question to internal and external u s e d 6 supports the idea
of a favorable perception of the performance of justice throughout the last ten years. In both
groups a significant majority believed that the judiciary was working better than it did 10
years before (Figure 5).




Source Novoa and Hasuike (2007)

5.40 It is not easy to determine the source of this perception of improvement in justice. In
the same survey, external users mentioned particular aspects of justice that had improved.
First, there is physical infrastructure: 9 1 percent of those interviewed considered this aspect
of the system to be better than before. Next in improvement, in the survey, was the way the
courts are equipped (80 percent), the system of criminal records (antecedentespenale~)
(79 percent), and the coverage of the courts (73 percent).

5.41 One observation should be borne in mind when interpreting the public opinion
surveys on Guatemalan justice. The lowest indicators of confidence correspond to the
institutions that are most directly involved in criminal affairs, such as the National Civil
Police, or the Ministerio de la G o b e r n ~ c i d nresponsible for the penitentiary system. In the
                                                      ,~~
2007 survey, both institutions got an average rating of 3 out of 10. Thus, part of the mistrust
which is still evident in relation to the judicial system seems to be related to the still weak
performance of the criminal justice institutions. It could be argued that the noncriminal
justice system, in which the Bank's project focused, is better perceived among users than the
judiciary as a whole.

5.42 The two-fold impression from these surveys that: (i) credibility in the judiciary is
higher today than a decade ago; and (ii) the criminal jurisdiction is still the most problematic,
was supported by almost every interview done in Guatemala.

5.43 Without knowing that this was one of the programs of the World Bank project, a
Justice of the Peace in Dolores, PetCn, mentioned A D y with the Judiciary (Un diu con la
                                                       a
Justicia) as an example of a good initiative. This education program, included in the project
as part of the component ?improved social communications,? was later adopted by the
judiciary, and introduced nationwide with the support of the judges and the Ministry of
Education. It is addressed to those under 15, enrolled in public primary schools, who take
part in a contest for school performance, to be allowed to approach the judiciary. The prize
for the best students in each promotion consists of two visits, one to the Provincial Tribunals,
and the other to the capital, where they are received by a plenary meeting of the Supreme
Court of Justice. At the request of the educators, the coverage of the rogram has been
extended. Some 300 municipalities, and 250,000 children, took part!        The Justice of the
Peace interviewed was clearly an enthusiastic participant in the project, and he clearly saw
that the program was a good way to enhance, for hture citizens, credibility in the judiciary.

5.44 The evaluation of the impact of legal education programs for the young is still very
new, even in developed countries. Despite this observation, there are some advantage^.^' So
the early contact of the young with the judicial system which the program promotes seems
favorable, and a target population of close to a quarter of a million young people from each
cohort is a very significant number in terms of improving credibility.

IMPROVE CONSISTENCY AND EQUITY THE APPLICATION THE LAW
                             IN             OF

5.45 Policy on traditional justice systems was a mechanism designed in the project to
improve consistency and equity in the application of the law. In the peace accords, it was
recognized that discrimination against the indigenous peoples with regard to the provision of
the services of justice had two dimensions: the difficulties of access to state justice, and the
lack of recognition of their own systems of justice.70

5.46 A QuichC indigenous mediator, agreed to be interviewed in Chichicastenango on
Good Friday, which was not a working day. She is 3.0 years old and studied social work.
She was selected by contest among 20 participants, most of them lawyers, based on merit,
and has plans to do graduate study in mediation in Argentina or Spain. It is not easy to
determine exactly what components of the project, or of the whole judicial reform program,
contributed to engaging her interest. Different kinds of impediments had to be overcome:
physical obstacles, such as the construction of the courts; budget limitations, to be able to pay
her; human capital and recruitment methods (that she would be interested in becoming a
mediator, and would pass the examinations on her own merits). There were also cultural
obstacles, such as the mediating parties accepting that an indigenous woman could put an end
to a dispute, or that her husband would think it acceptable for her to work. However,
ignorance about the possible contribution made by each factor, or the impossibility of
measuring the contribution of each of them, does not negate the importance of the fact that
she was recruited by the judiciary; that she is motivated, that she resolves some 500 cases a
year, 80 percent of which are in the Quiche language, and that she wishes to do graduate
studies for continued improvement, and as she herself says, ?bringing in more people all the
time.? Even if this were an isolated case, it would be unwise not to consider it as a
significant achievement of the reform in Guatemala.

5.47 This mediator is not an exception. Of the 82 mediators currently serving, 56 percent
are women, and 63 percent come from the indigenous communities. Indigenous women
represent 28 percent of the total number of mediators. Almost two-thirds of centers are under
the responsibility of indigenous mediators.71

5.48 The coordination of official justice and indigenous customary law has not been an
easy task. For some, there are still legal-even constitutional-obstacles. There are also
practical problems related to language, even though progress has been made in the
appointment of indigenous judges.72

5.49 Although they are still uncommon, cases in which Guatemalan judges accept
decisions made under indigenous law are beginning to appear. In 2005, the Supreme Court
of Justice recognized, in a case of robbery, that a person tried by the indigenous system could
not then be tried a second time by the official system. ?The School of Judicial Studies has
made a great effort in training a group of more than some 600 individuals, including judges,
clerks, and officers, who are indigenous, bilingual, and members of the community. The
training has been conducted mainly in the Peace Courts. Judges have been sensitized and
have assumed a different attitude to indigenous law.?73

5.50 Overall, efficacy of objectives for Guatemala is considered to be substantial. There
has been an advance in the recognition of indigenous justice. The increased availability of
courts in remote parts of the country is a first step in increasing access to justice. In
particular, the mediation centers have been a mechanism for approach and coordination
between the two systems ofjustice: the official one and the indigenous customary law. This
is not only due to the ethnic composition of mediators but also that of the users, which today
is similar to that of the general population in general. Certain coincidences in procedure-in
mediation and customary law-and a greater sensitization of judicial operators have also
helped to close the gap between the two legal systems.74

IMPROVING THE RENDERING OF JUDICIAL
                                  CONFLICT RESOLUTION SERVICES

5.5 1 The Colombia project had only one objective, which was to improve the rendering of
judicial resolution services. The output indicators stated in the PAD focused on judicial
performance and efficiency: (i) a reduction in processing time for case disposition,
(ii) increased number of cases disposed per judge, and (iii) increased satisfaction of users.

5.52 The achievements of the Colombian project differed from city to city. Positive results
were concentrated in Bucaramanga, the city that showed the highest efficiency indicators
during the project (completed caseshew cases), exceeding 200 percent in 2003 .7s Other
indicators show that, at the country level, the clearance rate increased from 15 percent in
January 2001 to 120 percent in June 2006, while the total backlog decreased from 393,324

cases to 73,849 cases and the resolution rate increased from 62.6 percent to 81.26 percent
during the same period. IEG found no statistically significant difference between
developments in the aggregate and in the courts covered by the project.76

5.53 Aside from that distinction, there are two major issues with the data and what it
reflects. The first one is the quality of the data itself. Among Colombian scholars, the
government, and other stakeholders, there is deep mistrust in the judicial statistics of
Colombia, even to the point of questioning the CSJ's Annual Report to Congress.77 As
pointed out by one scholar, "the figures on new cases and cases cleared in the Report to
Congress for 2001-2002 do not coincide with the data included in the Reports in 2003-
2004."78

5.54 Perhaps more importantly, the second issue, is that the output indicators selected for
the M&E under the project were drastically affected by factors exogenous to the project
itself. These external shocks and developments, which are behind the broad trends indicated
above, were not taken into account in the design, implementation, or evaluation of the project
by the Bank.

5.55 Although Colombia's financial crisis was less damaging then Ecuador's, it
nonetheless had a significant impact on the performance of the judiciary. In the second half
of the 1990s Colombia faced a financial crisis and an unprecedented economic downturn, due
for the most part to very high real interest rates induced by substantial fiscal imbalances as
well as to a breakdown of supervision of publicly owned banks. The downturn and the high
real interest rates led to historical peaks in non-performing loans, especially mortgages.

5.56 Furthermore, a few Constitutional Court judgments completely altered the regulatory
framework of the savings and loans system and the financing of real estate and housing.
Various government measures adopted for debtor relief were insufficient, and debtors took
advantage of the leeway offered by the Constitutional Court and embarked in an active
process of "seeking individual solutions through the courts."79Thus the weakness of the civil
courts was made all the more evident by the conjunction of the numerous processes initiated
by the mortgage lenders, and the intense activism by the debtors, who were ready to dispute
all sorts of issues before the courts.

5.57 The ensuing huge congestion in the civil courts led to the reform the Code of Civil
Procedure (CPC) in 2003. The reform concentrated on procedural changes to the juicio
ejecutivo, the special process used in debt collections.80In addition, the government moved to
increase the number of civil court judges from 809 in 2001 to 854 in 2004, an increase that
was later reversed as the number of new cases declined.


76 The clearance partial rate (judgmentshew cases) is three percentage points higher in the project courts, but
the 95 percent confidence interval goes from -3.1 to +9.2 percentage points. In addition, the clearance total rate
(judgmentsltotal case load) shows a 1.7 percentage point weaker performance in the project courts, with a
95percent confidence interval that goes from -9.5 to +6.0 percentage points. Data taken from World Bank
(2009).

5.58 The impact that the financial crisis and higher judicial activism had on the workload
of the civil courts, along with legislative and administrative emergency measures to solve it,
were not even mentioned in internal evaluations of the Bank's project. In Said and Florez
(2005), for example, for the peak of 1999, when new cases in the civil courts increased from
70,000 to 100,000 in a single year, no explanation is offered. The fall to less than 60,000 in
the following year was attributed to "a transfer of competency from the civil circuit courts to
the municipal courts, which face an additional demand that is generating congestion.""
Oddly, the document went on to make the point that `'this phenomenon did not affect the
project data, because the project began to be executed in 2002." What is even more
disturbing is that the drastic increase and subsequent decrease in completions was totally
attributed to the project. "The impact in terms of decongestion during 2003 was very
significant. Almost 105,000 cases were completed, and the stock was reduced by
30,000 case files. The evolution of the stock of cases shows a positive impact from the
project in the only variable it controls (completion)."82 No reference is made to the drastic
measures taken in 2003, and 2004, such as the change in the Code of Civil Procedure and the
creation by the government of special decongestion courts.

5.59 In the various implementation reports, the emphasis was placed on the congestion rate
and the clearance rate. There was a clear effort to ensure that these indicators assess the
project according to international parameters. The tacit assumptions in these reports were
that the project was being executed under constant demand and that the legal framework
remained the same and legal procedures had not been changed. The monitoring of the project
then mistakenly pointed out that the efficiency gains in the Circuit Courts are the result of a
combination of a new management model, articulated around a modern case-tracking system
(Justicia XYI), physical infrastructure remodeling, upgrading to modern computer equipment,
suitable training, and teamwork incentives. The environment and the legal system in which
the program was being executed were thereby not adequately accounted for.

5.60 The omission of exogenous factors was repeated in the ICR. It compares of the basic
aggregate statistics between the peak of the crisis and those of the period after the emergency
measures, again disregarding the environment and the changes in the legal system. "The
clearance rate increased from 15 percent in January 2001 to 120 percent in June 2006. The
backlog decreased from 393,324 cases to 73,849 cases during the same period. Overall, the
backlo of the 73 project courts by end-2004 amounted to only 19 percent of the backlog in
2000."    8
5.61 The scant importance assigned in the project documents to the impact of the financial
crisis on the judicial system is disquieting, given that previous work by the Bank (2002) had
already pointed out that factor.84

5.62 In 2005 the Consejo Superior de la Judicatura (CSJ)-the         executing agency for the
project-commissioned an opinion survey in 2005. The survey covered users-litigant
lawyers, plaintiffs and defendants-of the civil circuit courts in the five cities that took part
in the program. No baseline values were established at the beginning of the project, and this
particular survey does not allow a comparison with the courts that were not part of the

project, nor with other cities. Only one of the questions in the survey allows the possibility of
a comparison with the situation of the courts before, or without the project. In the form given
to the litigant lawyers to fill, there is a question about the time it takes to clear cases.85 The
litigant lawyers represent a large chunk of the cases handled, and represent a qualified group
to the extent that they are experts that work with the higher (circuit) level courts. Their
replies to the questionnaire were not positive for the project. Only 16.4 percent of them
perceived that civil circuit courts covered by the project had improved in the sense that the
time required to complete a case was now shorter than the "usual time." By contrast,
27 percent consider that the time was now longer, and 56 percent thought that the time had
not changed.86Balancing these responses, if anything, the project seems to have worsened
things rather than improved them.

5.63 In 2007, the Universidad Externado de Colombia, at the request of the government,
did a detailed evaluation of the pr~ject.~'Based on judicial statistics provided by the CSJ,
this evaluation found that the impact of the project was negligible and, when positive, it had
been transitory. Furthermore, it found little systematic difference between the performance
of pilot courts and the other courts. With the project, congestion was reduced only in
Medellin, and remained stable or was higher in the rest of the cities. Interestingly enough,
the congestion indicator was lower in the courts of the cities not included in the project.

5.64 As part of this same evaluation, another survey was done in 2007, canvassing 98 users
in the five cities where the project was executed. More than half of those surveyed
(55.1 percent) indicated that they had no idea that a project for improving the civil courts had
                       Users
been im~lernented.~~ perceived changes in the way that services were being offered,
with better attention to customers.g0 In addition, almost half (47 percent) considered that the
speed with which services were being provided by the courts was eitherfair or deficient."

5.65 External analysts interested in the impact of the financial crisis and regulatory
changes on the performance of the civil courts completely discount or disregard the eventual
impact of the Bank project. Some of those who worked closely with the CSJ at the time were
not even aware of the Bank's efforts to promote the effectiveness of civil courts. On the
other hand, they attribute the sharp reduction in the backlog ofjuicios ejecutivos involving
mortgages--from a maximum of 123,000 in 2002 to about half (68,000) in 2005-to two
factors: (i) the reforms to the Code of Civil Procedure introduced in early 2003; and (ii)
45 decongestion courts created in March 2004, which operated with the urpose of dealing
with this type of case in the three largest cities until the end of that year.f2

5.66       Overall, efficacy of objectives in Colombia is considered to be negligible.

Software Development
5.67 Software development for case management deserves special attention because it was
a common feature in all three countries, and because there were major issues with it in all
cases. These issues, which would have not come to the surface easily without this in-depth
evaluation, point out to an unfortunate lack of protocols and standards in the projects
regarding the measurement of the output and outcome, as well as the costs, of the
components related to software and computer systems.

5.68 In all three countries, the software development component was the least satisfactory.
The projects brought in external-to the judiciary and to the country-"experts" to develop
expensive software programs, which were far from custom made or user friendly, and that
needed extensive adaption to local procedures and to the Law of the countries.

5.69 In Guatemala, various judges were of the opinion that the previous and home-grown
            i l - e f c see
                          ,
system- W l y P r e t Box l-outperformed the international experts' software,
originally designed for criminal justice cases using the Law, procedures and mores of a
different country. Initially these judges were very reluctant to adopt the new and, for them,
inferior platform. Their main concerns were: (i) ease of use; (ii) consistency with Guatemalan
Law and formal and informal procedures; and (iii) the loss of very valuable files in the
migration to the new system.

Box 1. Willy Perfect
In the field visit to Guatemala, in a meeting with judges, talking about the case-management software,
one of them candidly said: "Willy-Perfect worked better". Asked about Willy-Perfect, an interesting
story came out. Years before the international experts working with the project came in, Willy Ochoa,
an amateur computer expert and at that time a court clerk (secretary), had developed a set of Word-
Perfect macros simply to do his job more efficiently. This plain, unsophisticated, but quite useful tool
was rapidly adopted and adapted by fellow workers and even by some judges, who were beginning to
use computers. It soon became known as "Willy-Perfect." It was a good example of what is now
known as "open architecture" software: every user made suggestions or changes and Willy, working
on weekends on his own time, made the necessary adjustments for sharing both innovations and
information. When the Bank project began, Willy Ochoa, quite modestly, wrote a letter to the
international experts. He simply wanted to be part of the team in charge of the development of the
new, high-tech, software. His request, however, was rejected and he was never brought into the
software development team. When the experts' software was finally implemented, Willy Ochoa
himself had to work on the "migration" of information to the new system and data base.

output from the software component of the Bank's project. For some it was an overhaul of
Justicia =I, for others it was mostly training users of that software. 95

5.71 In Ecuador, even among the technical staff of the judiciaryg6there is no agreement on
whether the current software is an upgrade of the product supplied by DPK, an international
consulting firm, or whether it is based on a native system that was developed by a student
working on his college dissertation in consultation with some judges. In any event, the
current platform is the result of needed continuous upgrades and adaptations by a group of
Ecuadoran programmers, and can be considered mostly native at this stage. There are many
advantages of this new, native, software, which can be grouped in two. For one thing costs-
salaries and royalties. DPK's software was written in Xnear/workflow, which entailed a
considerable yearly fee. The new, native, software is developed in DELPHI and pays no
annual royalties. The differences in final price tag of each version are huge: DPK software's
cost was in the range of US$1 and US$2 million, with annual royalties of around
US$200,000. According to the information supplied by different programmers to this
evaluation, the development of the new platform was done with cost of about US$50,000 in
salaries, and no royalties are being paid. For another, the new software is really custom made
and adapted to Ecuadoran Law, procedures and mores, because it is the result of long-term,
day-to-day, interaction between users and developers. The learning and training processes
provided and continue to provide the opportunity to easily incorporate suggestions for
improving the interface. Accordingly, improvements have been, and in the future can be,
incremental. In addition, these improvements bring in comments and suggestions from
different cities. Last but not least, the new, native, software is fully adapted to Ecuadoran
Law and has been adjusted smoothly to take into account changes in legislation.




95 Management indicates that most project resources were allocated to providing the hardware for that software
to operate (including an integrated network) and strengthening human resource skills relevant for the court and
case management applications of the software.

  Risk to Development Outcome
  6.2     Sustainability of the projects depends on the degree of institutionalization and the way
  in which the initiatives proposed have been adopted by the judiciaries involved. In this
  regard, the results were good in two of the countries.

  6.3    In Ecuador, several years after the project closed, Projusticia is still recognized in the
  media as "the body responsible for the modernization of the justice system,"97and the entity
  responsible for coordinating the agenda between the Judiciary, the Executive, and Congress.
  The consolidation of this coordination work to support the judicial system was expressed in




  97   "Projusticia busca rnodernizar la Corte." Hoy, May 21, 2007. www.hoy.com.ec.

the creation of the Ministry of Justice at the end of 2007.98 Both the first Minister of Justice
and the present one are former directors of P r o j u ~ t i c i a . ~ ~

6.4     In Guatemala, the Judiciary assimilated the project well in institutional terms. This
undoubtedly has to do with the magnitude of the reforms. In every instance during the visit
of the team for this evaluation, comments gave the impression that the project's legacy was
something which was still alive. Despite its small staff, there is a perception of continuity
between the project coordination and the current Unidad de Modernizacidn del Organismo
Judicial (UMOJ-Unit for the Modernization of the Judiciary. All files and documents from
the project are available, and the person currently responsible, Napoleon Guix, diligently
responded to all questions. Maria del Carmen Ortiz, sub-Coordinator for six years in UMOJ,
is currently the General Manager of the Judiciary. Another indication of sustainability of the
project is that some of the actions undertaken continue autonomously, and in some cases,
without being identified as having been initiated by the Bank. No factors have been detected
which might endanger the main achievements of the project: the consolation of the judiciary,
greater access, and integration with indigenous justice. The emphasis on the construction of
infrastructure, and the fact that more than adequate quality standards have been achieved, is
also positive for sustainability.

6.5     Unlike Ecuador or Guatemala, where it was relatively easy to find an organization or
a person to be the guardian of the institutional memory of the project, in Colombia this task
was much more elusive. The CSJ seems to be concerned with other matters, and there is no
great interest in speaking about or discussing something considered as remote as the project.
Reflecting this way of seeing things, the main promoter of the project disapproves of the
custom of evaluating the project two years after it closes. loo Even before the project ended,
CSJ seemed to be engaged in rather different endeavors. Moreover, the government itself
obtained a Japan Policy and Human Resources Development (PHRD) Grant to develop its
own strategy for continuing improvements in the justice system, including by broadening
access to it. These resources were also used to finance the evaluation of the project carried
out by Universidad Externado de Colombia and to create a new set of baseline data for a new
policy agenda.

6.6     Two sections of the careful evaluation made at the end of a project by Universidad
Externado de Colombia corroborate these observations. The first is the impression among
some in the judiciary that the project had not even been formally closed and what was to

the project are deficient, and the recommendation that when similar programs are undertaken

memory.'02 The project did not leave its mark, even in the CSJ where, as a matter of
principle, people should be aware of what was done. A disconcerting and surprising finding

was that neither the associations of lawyers--experts in procedure or litigation, lo3 nor two
well-respected research centers on judicial matters lo4 were aware of the existence of the
project. It is thus regrettable that there will be little institutional or academic memory of
what went wrong and why in a case where learning from an unsatisfactory outcome would be
fruitful.

presented in Table 6.

designed to collect appropriate data given objectives and given existing and available data.

projects proposed looking at the following key performance indicators:

The specification of baselines and target values for overall indicators varied among projects.
It was quite precise for Ecuador. In Colombia, specification was more flexible. In
Guatemala, some broad ideas were stated about how performance indicators could be
measured (surveys, progress reports, Supreme Court documents, focus groups) but no
baselines or target values were specified.
6.10 Other performance indicators were proposed in the appraisal documents. Both in
Ecuador and Guatemala, each project subcomponent had its own performance indicator.
Most of these indicators were limited to the delivery of an output.

6.1 1 The M&E design of the three projects, and especially in Ecuador and Colombia,
shows a quantitative bias without a previous assessment of availability or quality of
information needed to calculate the indicators.

6.12 Key performance indicators were mostly based on judicial statistics or opinion
surveys. For the former, there is a conflict of interest arising from the fact that the
organization responsible for compiling the judicial statistics is simultaneously being
evaluated with these figures. This conflict of interest was ignored in the design of the M&E.

6.13 Opinion surveys, when carried out by the same agency whose performance is to be
assessed, are hardly reliable. The second limitation of opinion surveys relates to how
representative the chosen sample is. Knowledge of the users of justice is tenuous, and
knowledge of potential beneficiaries even more so. Perhaps the only qualified group would
be trial lawyers, yet their opinions may be biased by their particular interests. Under these
conditions, the design of a sample framework that will properly represent the population
affected by the reforms is not an easy matter. These two problems were not discussed in the
M&E design.

6.14 Finally, public's perception of justice is heavily influenced by the facts that judicial
systems are too complex and heterogeneous, and that the performance of its various branches
depends on the actions of a number of related state agencies. For instance, the performance
of the police or other State law enforcement agencies, both in a way alien to the judicial
system, has a bearing on the image of the criminal justice system. As was the case in
Guatemala, the public's perception of justice may be adversely affected by the performance
of these alien institutions.

Monitoring and Evaluation: Implementation and Utilization
6.15 In terms M&E implementation, the evaluation assessed the extent to which
appropriate data was actually collected using adequate collection methods. For M&E
utilization, the evaluation was looked at the extent to which appropriate data was used to
inform decision-making and resource allocation.

6.16 In the three projects, it was assumed that the task of compiling judicial statistics could
be delegated to computer software being promoted with the project, which was expected to
produce them as an automatic byproduct of file management. The results obtained shed a
dim light on the availability, quality and impartiality of that information. With a few
exceptions, judicial statistics to date are either nonexistent, or are not reliable, or are not
transparent and made public, or are not vetted, discussed or analyzed in an independently
rigorous manner.
                                                       35

6.17 Baselines values for key performance indicators were not always established, even
during supervision. When opinion surveys were done at different moments of project
implementation, they were not always comparable.

6.18 The so-called pilot programs were not always true pilots because there was no
controlled experiment on a small scale, executed in advance to check the feasibility or to
improve the relevance of a preliminary design. For the projects in Ecuador and Colombia,
the term "pilot" was used simply to refer to many courts in which simultaneously, not
sequentially, and in different places, the project was executed.

6.19 Physical infrastructure and support for computer systems are recurrent components in
the judicial reform projects of the Bank. When a significant portion of the budget is invested
in physical construction, it is surprising that the specifications, unit costs and characteristics
of these works receive such little attention. No detailed procedures were drawn up to receive
them, and the evaluation design was implicitly restricted to an attempt at measuring their
eventual impact through surveying user opinion. The same point can be made regarding the
funds invested in software, for which no effort was made to determine what the outcome
should be, or how to evaluate its cost.

6.20 The use ofjudicial statistics for evaluation was not complemented with a detailed
analysis of the circumstances affecting the performance of the courts. As noted above, in
Ecuador and Colombia the chosen indicators were substantially affected by factors
exogenous to the projects. Nevertheless, the evaluation completely disregarded these
exogenous factors that were bringing significant changes to the civil courts covered by the
project. Moreover, major developments within the courts themselves appear not to have been
accounted for in Colombia-in 2007, about 81 percent of the cases were judged to be
inactive, that is, without any reaction from the parties to the lawsuit in the last year.lo8
Surprisingly, this dead load does not seem to have been identified when monitoring and
evaluating the project.

6.2 1 Survey-based indicators also showed their limitations. In Colombia, for example, one
of the surveys was done directly by the Consejo Superior de la Judicatura (CSJ, with no
baseline or control group. The survey could not, therefore, provide the basis for an
evaluation. And the only reliable answers of the survey, those of the trial lawyers, were left
aside when summarizing the results.

6.22 The problems of opacity, poor quality, conflict of interest, or simply nonexistent
judicial statistics, or bias or limitations in opinion surveys, did not receive the attention they
warranted in these projects. The inability to calculate reliable indicators based on judicial
statistics was evident in all of the projects. Instead of facing this stark reality, all three
projects ignored the difficulties evidently on the assumption that these would resolve
themselves, say by fixing some technical obstacle.

6.23 The interviews for this evaluation suggest that the demand for judicial statistics is
small or almost nonexistent. Also, that the incentive to generate them is weak. For the
judges, and for the support staff in the courts, they are no more than a nuisance. Among the
judges of the five Colombian cities where the project was executed, there was a consensus
that the least-used part of the management software was that of the statistical template^."^

      Vizcaya (2008), p. 103.
                                                    36


Furthermore, a number of judges said that they found it rather unreliable, and almost
irrelevant, because they were easy to manipulate.

6.24 Only in Cuenca, Ecuador, are judicial statistics available to the public."' Despite the
good quality of computer programs in that city, the collection of information has taken place
manually by its main user, the local delegate of the Council of the Judicature. Once a year,
since the project began, he visits all courts in Cuenca to determine, with every clerk, how
many new cases came in during the previous year, how many were cleared, how many are
active, and how many can be cleared out of the statistics.

6.25 Also, only in that city a few indicators based on those statistics are used as
management tools. The Cuenca delegate of the Council of the Judicature trusts his data
charts because he gathers the data himself. Furthermore, he maintains permanent contact
with judges and administrative personnel, and therefore he is aware of all the eventualities
that could affect the functioning of the courts, and the major changes in his data charts. For
the annual evaluation of the results of his jurisdiction, these statistical figures are only one
element that for the most part is just a complement to the detailed personal dialogue that he
maintains with each of the judges. The officer admittedly does not automatically use the
statistics to support decisions. They are only one more element in a participatory process on
the allocation of resources.

6.26       Based on these considerations, this report rates M&E as follows:

                                    Ecuador                    Guatemala         Colombia

Bank Performance
6.27 For the rating of bank performance, this evaluation assessed the extent to which
services provided by the Bank (i) ensured quality at entry of the operation and (ii) supported
effective implementation through appropriate supervision.

6.28 In terms of ensuring quality-at-entry, in Ecuador the project responded both to the
Bank's strategy and to the county's judicial policy. Also, there was a detailed assessment of
the judiciary before the project was carried out by the Bank. The design of the project was
based on this assessment.

6.29 In terms of significance in the quality of supervision, one black spot in this project
was related to the software contract with the firm DPK. The company delivered a very
expensive software that needed a great deal of upgrades and a complete adaptation to
Ecuadoran Law, procedures and mores. Not surprisingly, Ecuador ended up replacing DPK's
program with a home-grown platform, as discussed above. This evaluation notes that this
replacement highlights the fact that the project itself had already generated enough internal
capacity to replace the faulty software, and, to the Bank's credit, it supported the adoption of
the new, home-grown platform. Surprisingly there is no discussion of the poor performance

of the consultancy firm in the Bank documents, despite the substantial waste of resources and
of the potential lesson to be learned.

6.30 Another weak point in the project supervision in Ecuador was that there was no
recognition of the impact of the economic and financial crisis on the performance of the
courts, nor of the differences in procedures and mores between the different regions.

6.3 1 In Guatemala, the project design and objectives matched the Bank's strategy for the
country and the government's overall reform program. The fact that the Bank's project
supported only a small part of an ambitious plan to modernize the judiciary, gives the
impression that too many objectives were set for the project and that they were too diverse."
The plan for the modernization of the judiciary was a byproduct of the peace accords and
only a part of the undertakings stemming from them, a process was a political act that had
broad participation, as well as international contributions and supervision. Taking this
political dimension into account, it is difficult to imagine how the Bank project could have
been more pointed on objectives and indicators.

6.32 It should be noted that the Guatemala project correctly omitted certain objectives that
show up in other Bank legal and judicial reform projects. For example, there were no
components aimed at strengthening markets or creating a legal environment favorable to
private business and foreign investment. In an ideologically fragmented environment such as
the one in Guatemala at the time of the project, the fact that the Bank demonstrated such
flexibility led to greater country ownership of the project.

6.33 Despite the weighty presence of the criminal jurisdiction in the overall program for
the modernization of justice, the Bank was only marginally involved in this area, which has
been one of the most difficult and criticized. Given the detailed scrutiny of judicial matters in
the country, the simple fact that the project bypassed, almost unnoticed, much of the
criticisms of the judicial system in Guatemala is a real achievement.

6.34 In Colombia, the project deviated from the basic objectives of both the Bank's
strategy for the country and the government, which were to reduce violence, poverty, and the
linkage between the two. The idea that poor resolution of conflict was one of the causes of
violence, which in the Bank's documents was understood to be critical in the most
underprivileged areas, was reshaped at preparation to concentrate just on civil courts. With
no justification, the problem of access to justice was left aside, despite being a critical
element in the diagnosis of violence.

6.35 No effort was made during either preparation or execution to identify the potential
beneficiaries of the project. Had this been done, it would have been clear from the beginning
that the big financial conglomerates were the group that would gain the most from the
project.

 6.36 In the supervision of the project, the focus on unreliable aggregate statistical
.indicators translated into a lack of attention to external economic factors and important legal
 changes that ended up playing a key role in determining the performance of civil courts. As
 noted by IEG in the ICR Review, the project "did not develop clear output and outcome
 indicators, leaving it to be done during project implementation. Even to the extent it did, the
 distinctions between outputs and outcomes were blurred." Moreover, following the closing of

 the project, the government had to use a Japan PHRD Grant to finance the development of a
 new set of baseline data for a follow-up project.'"

 6.37 Based on these considerations, this report rates the Bank performance laid out in
 Table 9.

 Borrower Performance
 6.38 In terms of borrower performance, this evaluation assessed the extent to which the
 government and implementing agency (i) ensured quality of preparation and implementation,
 and (ii) complied with covenants and agreements towards the achievement of development
 outcomes.

 6.39 In both Ecuador and Guatemala project preparation was done through a lengthy and
 participatory process of discussion with stakeholders. This was a process that was supported
 both by the governments and the judiciaries. There is no evidence of a similar process in
 Colombia, even in a smaller scale.

 6.40 In Ecuador and in Guatemala, the interest of the governments and of the judiciaries
 in the objectives of their respective projects was maintained throughout the execution. Also,
 there was adequate dissemination and continuation of the essence of the projects after these
 closed.

 6.41 In Colombia, by contrast, the government and its executing agency showed little
 interest in the project. Not even the design was discussed with all the relevant stakeholders;
 no such discussion was restricted to governmental agencies and institutions. Important
 procedural reforms to the civil justice were carried out during the project's execution with no
 communication between the project staff, the government, the legislature, or the parties that
 were promoting those reforms. Funds were disbursed slowly and, as a result, the project took
 longer to execute. The dissatisfaction with the project among judges in Medellin was such
 that in the final evaluation they collectively refused to answer the survey forms."3

7. Lessons
7.1     Three clusters of lessons can be identified based on this review. These cannot, of
course, be presented as definitive, but the implementation experience of the three projects
provides sufficient elements for them to be put forward with reasonable confidence as to their
significance and broader applicability.

7.2     Adaptation of Project Objectives and Design to Local Law, Conditions and
Peculiarities. The importance of adapting project design to country conditions is a common
lesson from other project contexts, but it is important that in judicial reform projects the
adaptation extends to the full range of factors that may significantly impact implementation.
Thus, anchoring the projects in a thorough understanding of the country and its conditions
becomes a priority. In the case of the projects under consideration here, for instance, the
possible effect of economic downturns and upturns on the workings of the justice system was
virtually ignored, despite being very significant and notwithstanding the assumed link
between judicial reform and economic development. Financial crisis in Ecuador and
Colombia had a considerable impact on the performance of the judiciary in the course of
implementation of the projects. Economic conditions determine the demand for judicial
services, so it is important to take them into account in both the design and evaluation of
projects.

7.3      The interpretation of "local" also needs to drill down well below the legal framework
and the national level. In the projects considered here, implementation was influenced to a
large extent by conditions specific to the distinct regions or localities of the client countries
that were being targeted. What worked in Cuenca or Bucaramanga failed in Quito and
Bogoth. Knowledge of the local environment continues to be sufficiently scant such that
there can be little certainty, even expost, about the reasons for the variability in results from
city to city. Both the design of projects and prior analytic assessment efforts need to keep in
mind variations in conditions and peculiarities across regions and localities, and appropriate
flexibility needs to be woven into the fabric of project design. For instance, what emerges
from the experience of the projects under consideration here in architecture and construction
of infrastructure, as well as in software development, but likely extends to other areas as well,
is that local conditions require adequately customized designs, and they must be of local, not
imported, origin and of manageable scale and complexity. In sum, successful judicial reform
seems to be less about global technology, and more about local expertise, executed by people
with intimate knowledge of the judicial system and Law and associated procedures.

7.4     Flexibility in Overall Approach, and Solicitation of Local Knowledge and Speci3c
Benejciary Input, for Selection of Project Objectives, Design and Implementation
Arrangements. While it is clear that identifying the right instruments, and the right agencies
(among the multitude of other factors affecting project outcomes) ultimately has a
determining influence on the success of Bank projects, what has been less clear is the "what"
and the "how to." What appears to have been decisive in the case of the projects assessed
here is the willingness to avoid constraining the overall approach to project conception and
design. For instance, results of the projects appear to have been better in those components
that, beyond economic considerations, privileged equality and the expansion of civil and
social rights. Similarly, bottom-up or grass-roots approaches appear to have worked better
than top-down approaches because they related more effectively to local mores and drew on
local knowledge. To generalize, project design tends to be undermined when the Bank lacks
                                               40


in-depth knowledge concerning the judicial system, the country's Law, legal procedures,
customs, and mores.

7.5     In particular, components designed with the input of lawyers knowledgeable about the
client country's Law and legal system and with contributions from local legal think tanks and
NGOs typically proved more effective than components lacking this feature. Successful
interventions-whether involving software internal to the judiciary or legal aid for poor
women in Ecuador, architecture or antecedentes penales in Guatemala-were more likely to
be based on detailed assessments of local needs and peculiarities. Beyond this, however, they
were also more likely to be based on specific identification of, and close interaction with, the
beneficiaries of proposed actions. A generalization of this latter point would suggest that it is
better to try to satisfy the concrete needs of a known, specific group of people, as well as to
seek a clear understanding of the conflicts that have impacted or will likely impact them and
how the country's legal system might resolve them, than to design and execute a project the
notional beneficiary of which is a more abstract entity, such as "the public," "the private
sector," or "public opinion."

7.6     In sum, experience points strongly to the need to devote more resources in the design
stage to finding the local experts-the Willys-to give them an appropriate role in the design,
execution, and evaluation of the projects. This also appears important in order to sow the
seeds of two critical properties of a project, which foreign experts seldom bring (at least by
themselves-wnership        and sustainability. Engagement of such local expertise from the
outset would almost certainly result in diagnoses and proposals concerning project coverage
that go beyond what happens mechanically in the courts, if only based on the fact that the
local experts live and work in that environment and know the Law of the country. Diagnoses
and proposals will better integrate local peculiarities and identify specific beneficiaries and
conflict types affecting them.

7.7      Limitations of By-products of Case Management Software for M&E. One lesson that
emerges clearly from the projects under assessment here is that useful and reliable judicial
statistics do not tend to be automatically generated as a by-product of case management
software. Indeed, such software tends to be a costly product with very few users. There are
pitfalls in focusing attention on idealized indicators that are rarely available to enable
adequate project M&E-this will tend, for instance, to detract from more rudimentary, yet
often equally enlightening, tasks such as monitoring outputs. Equally, there are pitfalls in
focusing exclusively, or even predominantly, on aggregate performance indicators-there
may, for example, be a temptation to "think bigger" in the design of reform, at the expense of
more modest initiatives that might otherwise result in very concrete gains in the
administration of justice for specific categories of local users.
