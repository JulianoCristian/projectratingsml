I. ENERGY SECTOR
A. Overview
1.01      China is the fourth largest producer and third largest consumer of
commercial energy in the world. Coal is by far the most important source of
commercial energy (70% of total production in 1982), but oil production has
increased rapidly since 1972 to become an important source of commercial
energy (22% in 1982) and of export revenue (accounting for about one quarter
of total exports). Natural gas, hydroelectric power and small quantities of
shale oil and geothermal power constitute the balance of commercial energy./1
Noncommercial sources supply energy equivalent to about 40% of commercial
production. Commercial energy production grew at 10.5% p.a. from 1952-75, but
the growth rate has fallen since then and between :1979 and 1981 total
production declined by 2.1%. This trend was reversed in 1982, when there was
a 3.8% rise in commercial energy production. About 20% of oil production and
1% of coal production is currently exported.
1.02      China's achievements in developing energy resources over the past
three decades have been impressive. Production in coal has increased from
some 60 million tons in 1952 to 666 million tons in 1982. During the same
period power generating capacity increased from about 2,000 MW to 72,360 MW.
Oil production increased from about 0.1 million tons in 1950 to 106 million
tons in 1979. These developments notwithstanding, the future prospects remain
uncertain. The major oil fields, which together account for about 90% of
China's oil production, have peaked and entered a declining phase. In 1982,
oil production fell to 102 million tons. No new discoveries have been made of
a magnitude to offset this decline. Rapid expansion of the coal industry
faces almost intractable problems in terms of investment, location and trans-
portation. The remoteness of large hydro sites from load centers and the long
gestation period of hydro projects preclude sizable increases in hydropower's
share of energy production in the first half of the 1980's.
B. Resource Endowment
1.03      The major existing and potential sources of primary energy are
indicated below:
(a) Coal
1.04      Coal is China's traditional source of energy and at present caters
for nearly 70% of its demand for commercial energy. The output of raw coal in
1982 was about 666 million tons, a level surpassed only by USA and USSR.
Coal and lignite reserves are concentrated largely in the north and north-
east, which have about 70% of the total recoverable reserves (600 billion
tons) and a similar share of total output. About 75% of coal production
/1 See Annex 1, Commercial energy balance for 1980, 1982, and 1985.



comes from large mines with more than 0.6 million tons annual capacity. The
small mines (1,000-100,000 tons annual capacity), over 20,000 in number, are
rudimentary underground operations characterized by extremely low
productivity. The output of the small mines goes essentially to meet
local commercial and domestic needs. While there are some modern collieries
in China, most mines are only partially mechanized. Plans call for increased
mechanization in both old and new mines, and for the domestic manufacture of
underground mining equipment. The Government expects coal output to reach 700
million tons by 1985. However, in increasing coal output, transport,
essentially railroad capacity, appears to be a major constraint.
(b) Hydro Power
1.05      China's hydro power potential is among the largest in the world.
The toLal potential capacity is estimated at about 680,000 MW, of which about
380,000 MW is exploitable. At present, only about 23,000 MW or 6% of the
exploitable potential have been developed. The regional distribution of these
resources is shown in Annex 2. About 70% are located in southwestern China.
The Chang Jiang (Yangtze River) and its tributaries alone have a hydro power
potential of 230,000 MW. River systems in northwestern and southeastern China
each have a potential of above 20,000 MW. The Jinsha, Yalong and Datu rivers
of the Chang Jiang system, the middle and upper reaches of the Huanghe (Yellow
River), and the Hongshui River on the upper reaches of the Xijiang are major
areas of hydro-power development.
(c) Oil and Gas
1.06      Official estimates of oil and gas reserves are not available.  The
magnitude of China's proven and probable reserves is the subject of consid-
erable speculation and study outside the country. Varying estimates of
proven recoverable reserves of oil have been made; the opinion, however, is
now converging on a range from 1.8 to 2.5 billion tons. Estimates regarding
probable reserves, both offshore and onshore, are by nature somewhat
speculative. The current estimates range from 5-10 billion tons in the
onshore region and 4-8 billion tons in the offshore area.
1.07      Currently, the major non-associated gas fields are located in
Sichuan Province, where the recoverable reserves are estimated at 70 billion
cubic meters. In addition, there are some minor natural gas fields in the
northwestern part of China. Over and above this, the recoverable reserves of
associated gas are estimated at about 50 billion cubic meters. The cumulative
recoverable gas reserves are thus about 130 billion cubic meters, equivalent
to over 110 million tons of oil. There is, however, a view that gas reserves
have not been adequately explored and the presently known recoverable reserves
are a mere fraction of the full potential. According to some estimates, the
ultimate recoverable reserves of natural gas, both offshore and onshore, could
be as high as 3,000 billion cubic meters.



-3-
(d) Oil Shale
1.08      Reserves of oil shale in China are reported unofficially to be of
the order of 400 billion tons and may be much larger, since the geological
environment is favorable for their formation in many of the sedimentary
basins. Deposits of 100 billion tons or more, containing 5-10 billion tons of
oil, are reported in Heilongjiang and Hebei. The grade of most of the oil
shales is fairly low (less than 10%), but a few desposits have 10-20% of oil by
weight. Before 1958, oil shale accounted for almost half of Chinese oil
production, but the proportion declined rapidly as normal crude oil producton
increased after the discovery of the Daqing oilfieald in 1959. Currently,
about 300,000 tons of shale oil is being produced annually from the Liaoning
and Guangdong mines.
(e) Geothermal
1.09      China's geological conditions are such as to give rise to abundant
geothermal phenomena, especially in the Tibetan P:Lateau. Most occurrences
seem to be relatively low temperature groundwater suitable for space heating;
high temperature manifestation suitable for power generation seems to be more
frequent in the mountainous southwestern part of ithe country, such as Yunnan
Province and Xizang Autonomous Region (Tibet). The Ministry of Geology, which
has the responsibility for developing geothermal resources, has identified and
developed two projects. The first is a geothermal power station in the
Yangbajian geothermal field of Xizang, some 50 km from Lhasa, and the other is
an urban heating system developed in the southeastern part of Beijing.
Geothermal energy has not been developed to a significant extent in China.
(f) Noncommercial Energy
1.10      Data are scarce for quantifying noncommercial energy use in China,
but it is clearly significant, especially in the rural areas. Fuel wood from
loppings and grass, animal and crop residue, especially rice straw, are the
principal sources. Unofficial estimates place the energy extracted at 250
million tons of coal equivalent or about one-third of the total energy used.
If this estimate is correct, then the traditional fuels play a smaller role in
China than in most other countries with similar per capita consumption levels.
This is partially explained by a high population density and low availability
of forest resources.
1.11      For maximizing the benefits from noncommercial sources of energy,
China has pioneered and is now the leader in producing biogas.  Biogas, which
contains methane up to 65%, is produced by the fermentation of animal and
human waste, vegetation, household garbage and waste water. Originated in
the Province of Sichuan, biogas digesters are now used in many of the warmer,
southerly parts of China and currently exceed 6 million in number. A typical
10 cu m digester, which costs about 50 Yuan (US$25) to build, can meet the
composite energy needs of a family of five. In addition to the ecological
benefits, derived from lower deforestation and thes saving of fossil fuels,
biogas digesters produce organic fertilizer, an essential ingredient for
Chinese agriculture.



- 4-
C. Distribution of Energy Resources
1.12      China's energy resources are not evenly distributed.  The northeast
and the north, with nearly 30% of China's population and more than 45% of the
gross industrial output, have as much as 75% of the known commercial energy in
terms of coal and oil. These reserves currently account for the bulk of the
country's production and are being extracted at: a relatively fast pace. The
east, with one-fifth of the total population and 30% of the industrial output,
is almost devoid of any energy resource. In the south-west, there is consid-
erable hydropower and coal potential, but the central south is largely bereft
of energy resources except for hydro. Northwest China has about 9% and 20%
respectively of the recoverable coal and oil reserves, most of which, however,
are located in such remote and sparsely populat:ed areas that their development
would be extremely difficult and slow.
D. Sector Development Strategy
1.13      The Government plans to put major emphasis on development of the
energy and transport sectors during the period of the Sixth Five-Year Plan
(1981-85). Y 15.4 billion has been targeted for capital investments in the
petroleum sector, Y 20.7 billion for the power sector, and Y 17.9 billion for
the coal sector. In the petroleum sector, efforts will be concentrated on
prospecting and developing onshore and offshore areas. To accelerate
petroleum development, the Government has invit:ed foreign oil companies to
explore and help develop both offshore areas and selected onshore areas with
difficult drilling conditions. Investments in the power sector will be used
mainly for continued exploitation of hydro resources along the Huanghe, Chang
Jiang and Hongshui River systems, where large hydro-electric stations will be
built. In addition, a number of thermal power stations will be constructed,
some at the coal mines in Shanxi, Nei Monggol, Guizhou and various regions in
North China, others in Sichuan Province and in East and Southeast China.
Investments in the coal sector will emphasize the development of large open
pit mines in Shanxi and Nei Monggol. At the same time, other coal fields will
be developed, and small and medium-sized mines will be built. Efforts will
also be made to upgrade the technology in existing mines, improve the quality
of coal for direct burning and increase the poltential for coal export.
Investments in the transport sector will help ease constraints to coal
transport by increasing the capacity of railroads to carry coal from the
producing areas and building coal handling facilities in major coastal
harbors. To meet rural needs for energy, the Government will continue to
encourage the building of small hydro stations, use of biogas and planting of
woodlots for firewood.
1.14      In the initial implementation of the Five-Year Plan, large overall
investment reductions in 1981 have resulted in the postponement of several
coal and hydropower projects. Capital construction investment in energy
decreased in absolute terms by over 20% in 1981. In 1982, energy investment
has been restored to a normal level following the increase in total capital
construction investment in China. However, because of the long gestation
period required for energy projects, investmenls planned in the Sixth



Five-Year Plan (1981-85) will not bring much increase in energy supply until
the late 1980s. In the short run, the Government is trying to solve the
problem of energy shortage partly through energy conservation policies and
programs.
E. Efficiency of Energy Use
1.15      China's commercial energy consumption per dollar of GDP in 1978/79
was approximately 2.5 times that of other developing countries or industria-
lized market economies and about 1.5 times the average for centrally planned
economies. Micro-level energy intensity comparisons on a physical basis also
point to inefficient energy use in China. In the steel industry, which
consumes 12% of total commercial energy, energy consumption per ton in large
integrated Chinese plants is roughly twice that achieved in best international
practice while energy consumption in small and medium-sized plants is 25%
greater. Yet in nitrogenous fertilizer, cement, and brick manufacturing,
China's large-scale plants are closer to the international norm, but a large
share of production in these sectors is carried out in small plants and using
outmoded, energy-intensive techniques.
1.16      The problem of energy efficiency in China is due not only to certain
managerial/operational inefficiencies, which might be corrected in the rela-
tively short-term with little or no investment, but also to the use of old-
fashioned technology, inadequate facilities to capture waste heat, the scale
of industrial plants, and the raw materials used. Many of these problems will
take more time to solve, requiring substantial capital investment, some
industrial restructuring and a considerable expansion in transportation
facilities. The Government is well aware of and highly concerned about these
problems, and has been taking a number of measures to address them. The
measures comprise a mix of administrative and price incentives. Cutbacks in
plan allocations of energy to major industrial users appear to have been the
major factor thus far. Energy consumption norms have been reduced and more
strictly applied. Some very inefficient plants have been closed down.
Fifty-five energy conservation centers have been established to provide
enterprises with technical assistance in improving energy efficiency.
1.17      Some price increases have also been effected.  In 1q79, an excise
tax of Y 70/ton of crude and heavy oil (burned as fuel) was introduced, coal
prices were raised by 29% and natural gas by 25%. More recently, special
subsidies on diesel fuel for certain users were eliminated and coal prices to
industrial users were raised by Y 2 per ton. However, the present price
structure is not fully conducive to energy conservation. Although the prices
of gasoline and kerosene are above international levels, most industrial fuels
are priced well below world levels. Further increases in the price of coal
and a larger increase in the prices for petroleum products for industrial
users are needed to encourage increased coal production and a switch from oil
to coal consumption. Similarly, higher industrial electricity rates would
also encourage conservation and provide resources for capacity expansion,
thereby helping to eliminate the chronic shortage of electricity (which has
been estimated to account for about 20% of losses in industrial production).
Given the complexities of price reform, the magnitude of the changes that are
needed and the importance of extensive preparatory work, the Government has
decided that it will not be possible to implement comprehensive price reform
until after 1985. However, appropriate upward or downward adjustments in the



- 6 -
most urgent cases can and will be made. Among such cases, energy prices,
including power tariffs, are especially important. The Bank will continue to
address these issues through its economic and sector dialogue with the
Government.
1.18      Since 1979, energy consumption per unit of output has fallen signi-
ficantly. Apparent energy consumption increased by only 1.5-6.0% during
1979-82, while net material product rose by 14-15% during the same period.
According to rough estimates, about half of this decline in consumption per
unit of output may have been due to the changing structure of industry. Heavy
industry which consumes about four times as much energy per unit of output as
light industry, grew very slowly in 1980 and cleclined in 1981. This factor
was no longer operating in 1982 when heavy inclustry grew faster than light
industry. According to Government estimates, energy savings totalled 35
million tons of standard coal equivalent in 1S980, and 26.5 million tons in
1981. Energy savings due to efficiency improvements are said to have been the
the greatest in the following industries: iron and steel, nonferrous metals,
chemical products and thermal power plants. M[ost of these industries as well
as the chemical fertilizer industry still have! great potential for further
energy-saving efficiency improvements.
II. POWER SECTOR
A. Background
2.01      In spite of the wealth of electric power resources in China,
development of these resources has come late. During the early part of the
20th century, development of electric power stations took place largely
along the coast in large cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao and
Guangzhou. The majority of these plants, mostly thermal, were built and
owned by foreigners. In the 1930's, Japan started building power stations
in Northeast China to support exploitation of resources in that area.
Three hydroelectric power stations were built along the Yalu and Songhua
Rivers. By the end of 1944 the total installed capacity in China was about
3,100 MW. Only 1,850 MW were operable in 1949. Installed capacity developed
over a period of 33 years to 72,360 MW by the end of 1982, an average growth
rate of 11.7% p.a. The total electricity generation has increased from 4,300
GWh in 1949 to 327,678 GWh in 1982. Annual per capita generation of
electrical energy has grown from 8 kWh to 318 kWh during the same period.
2.02      In 1982, power accounted for about 24.1% of the total commercial
energy consumption (see Annex 1), of which about 6.1% was from hydro, 14.2%
from coal, 3.5% from oil and 0.3% from gas. Industry accounted for 75.0% of
the total electricity consumption: 61.5% for heavy industries and 13.5% for
light industries. Agriculture consumed 17.5%; transportation 0.6%;
residential, commercial and other 6.9%.
B. Institutions
2.03      Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power (MWREP).  In 1949,
the overall responsibility for energy was vested in one ministry, the Ministry
of Fuel Industry, covering the fields of coal, oil and electric power. This



Ministry was replaced in 1957 by three ministries: the Ministry of Coal
Industry, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry and the Ministry of Electric
Power. In 1958, the Ministry of Electric Power was merged with the Ministry
of Water Conservancy to form the Ministry of Water Conservancy and Electric
Power. It was separated in 1979 and remerged again in 1982 and is now renamed
- the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power (MWREP). The new MWREP
is designed to simplify development and control of large multipurpose projects
for flood control, irrigation, and power generation. With the abolition of
the State Energy Commission about the time of formation of MWREP, the latter
now reports directly to the State Council. The Ministry oversees all aspects
of water resources and electric power activities including policy making,
overall planning, design, construction and operation of power and water
resources projects of regional importance (see Chart 1: Organization of
MWREP).
2.04      MWREP is dependent on many of the other agencies of the State
Council for monitoring and regulating its affairs. Planning (annual and
5-year plans) and allocation of resources are approved by the State Planning
Commission (SPC) and the State Economic Commission (SEC). Financial regula-
tions are issued by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) while the banks provide
funds for construction and working capital. Prices for fuel and electricity
are regulated by the General Price Bureau. Wages and payments to workers
are regulated by the Ministry of Labor and Personnel. Foreign borrowings
and trade are controlled through the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations
and Trade (MFERT). All this ensures a high degree of centralized decision
making and limits the autonomy of the regional administrations, provincial
power bureaux and enterprises.
2.05      MWREP has 14 departments and bureaux in its head office in Beijing.
The Ministry has a Water Resources and Hydroelectric Power Construction
Corporation which oversees the investigation, design and construction of
new water resources and hydroelectric projects by the investigation and design
institutes and construction bureaux. The planning and design of thermal
projects, transmission and substation facilities is the responsibility of the
regional power design institutes under the supervision of the Power Planning
Institute. The Ministry also directly manages a number of scientific research
institutes, colleges, and training schools.
2.06      Regional Power Administrations.  Under MWREP, there are six regional
power administrations which coordinate operations of the regional grids and
develop long-term plans for the regions which are subsequently approved by the
Ministry and the State Planning Commission. A seventh regional power
administration including Guangdong Province and the Autonomous Region of
Guangxi is being formed. The six established regional power administrations
are:
(a) Northeast China Power Administration
Established in the late 1940s, this administration is fully
responsible for the system operation of three interconnected
provincial power grids (Heilongjiang, Liaoning and Jilin).



- 8 -
(b) North China Power Administration
This administration was established in the early 1950s and covers
the municipalities of Beijing, Tianjin and the provinces of
Hebei and Shanxi. Interconnections are strong and well developed.
(c) East China Power Administration
Established in 1949 in Shanghai, the administration coordinates
functions carried out by the Power Distribution Bureau of
Shanghai Municipality and the provincial power bureaux of
Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Anhui. The region is fully integrated.
(d) Northwest China Power Administration
The administration was established in the late 1960s. The
four provincial power bureaux of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia and
Qinghai are interconnected by 330 kV and 220 kV lines.
(e) Central China Power Administration
Although this administration is fairly new (established in 1979),
the two provincial power networks of Henan and Hubei are
already connected. Interconnection has been further strengthened
by the completion of a 500 kV line.
(f) Southwest China Power Administration
Established in 1981, this power administration is still in the
process of development. The pace of its development depends on
the abilities of provincial power networks (Guizhou, Sichuan
and eventually Yunnan) to produce electric power and their need to
interconnect.
2.07      No interconnections have yet been made between regions nor between
them and the networks that still operate in isolation.
2.08      Provincial Power Bureaux.  There are 25 power bureaux operating in
provinces and autonomous regions. Each power bureau is responsible for the
development of the major grids in its area as well as small generating
schemes, transmission and distribution facilities below 110 kV and supply to
consumers.
2.09      Sixteen power bureaux (Yunnan not incliaded) are under the six
regional power administrations (para. 2.06) and the remaining ten operate in
isolation. Among the latter, five are under the management of provincial
governments or governments of autonomous regions. They are the power bureaux
of Fujian, Hunan, Xijiang, Xizang and Nei Monggo'L. The remaining five
isolated provincial networks of Jiangxi, Shandong, Yunnan and most recently
Guangdong and Guangxi are directly under MWREP. They had been turned over to
MWREP because of their large-scale capital construction plans.

C. Regional Grids and Generating Capacity
2.10      In 1982, there were 32 power grids with capacities of more than 100
MW each of which 12 grids had capacities exceeding 1,000 MW. The total
installed capacity of these 12 grids was 54,028 MW, constituting about 74.7%
of the national total. Six of these 12 grids are major regional grids; the
areas covered,installed capacities and energy generated in 1982 are summar-
ized in Table 2.1.

2.11      Of the total generating capacity of 72,360 MW in 1982, 22,959 MW
or 31.7% was hydro and 49,401 MW or 68.3% was thermal. The largest hydro
station at present is at Liujiaxia on the Huanghe in Gansu Province aggre-
gating 1,225 MW in capacity. The second largest is the Danjiangkou hydro
station with a generating capacity of 900 MW located on the Han River. The
largest thermal station is Qinghe (1,100 MW) in Liaoning Province. The larg-
est hydro unit is 300 MW at Liujiaxia hydro station and the largest thermal
unit is 320 MW at Dagang thermal station (two units of 320 MW imported from
Italy). There are 85,000 small hydro stations totalling 7,500 MW in China,
95% of them are smaller than 500 kW and the average size is about 90 kW.
2.12      There are nine large hydro projects with capacities greater than
300 MW under construction in China aggregating 8,365 MW. Eight new thermal
power stations are under construction (4,800 MW) and five existing thermal
statioas are being expanded (3,295 MW) (Annex 3). China has entered into an
agreement with the Westinghouse Corporation of USA for the manufacture of
300 MW and 600 MW thermal units and a technical agreement with the EBASCO
Services Incorporated of USA for the design and engineering of these units.
D. Transmission Networks
2.13      By the end of 1982, there were 30,970 km of transmission lines of
220 kV, 926 km of 330 kV and 595 km of 500 kV. The first 500 kV trans-
mission line was completed in 1980 from Pingdingshan to Wuhan in the Central
China grid utilizing imported terminal equipment. The following 500 kV lines
(single circuit) are under construction:
Line                            Length (km)
Gezhouba - Wuhan                         327

Total                            L1385
E. Sector Development and Power Market
2.14      The growth in installed capacity, electricity generation and sales
since 1949 is summarized in Annex 4. Annex 5 indicates the electricity
generation by region and type of plants over the past 13 years.
2.15      The average growth rate of electricity generation from 1949 to
1982 was about 14.0%, while that from 1970 to 1982 was 9.0% p.a. The rate
of growth had slowed down to 2.9% in 1981 due to economic readjustments, but
picked up again to 6.0% in 1982.
2.16      Of the 327,678 GWh electric energy generated in 1982, 74,399 GWh
or 22.7% was produced by hydro plants and 253,279 GWh or 77.3% by thermal
plants (about 20% by oil).



- 11 -
2.17      The electric energy sold in 1982 was 280,080 GWh.  Sales have grown
at an average rate of about 14.2% p.a. since 1949, and 8.5% in the past ten
years. The growth was 4.7% and 6.3% in 1981 and 1982 respectively. The
consumption pattern by different categories of consumers is shown in Table
2.2.

2.18      As a result of the economic adjustment process within China, the
share of industrial consumption came down from 79% in 1979 to 75% in 1982
(due to slowdown in the establishment of new heavy industries and lower
demand from existing industries); the share of agriculture (including rural
residential and commercial uses) increased from 13.9% in 1979 to 17.5% in
1982; and the share of residential and commercial consumption in the urban
areas increased from 4.8% in 1979 to 6.2% in 1982.
2.19        MWREP applies the following indicators which are commonly used
by power utilities to assess the performance of the system operation: (a)
generation target; (b) fuel consumption; (c) station use; (d) line losses; (e)
plant utilization; and (f) productivity per employee. The performance
indicators for 1980, 1981 and 1982 are given in Table 2.3. Considering the
particular circumstances in China,/l the performance indicated is reasonable.
/1  Unit sizes under 50 MW account for 47% of the total capacity and units
of 50-100 NW account for another 20%.

F. Access to Electricity
2.20      Great efforts have been made in the past to electrify the rural
areas. The percentage of communes and brigades electrified by regions as of
1982 are summarized in Table 2.4.

National average            89.0                   70.6
2.21      Access to electricity is the highest in the northeast at 95.9%
and the lowest in the northwest at 53.2% of the brigades. The national
average is 70.6%; the percentage of population having electricity is about
60%.
G. Tariffs
2.22      Electricity tariffs have remained constant since 1952.  They
are reasonably uniform all over the country except in the northeast where
historically they have been about 30% lower. Special reduced rates are
sometimes allowed to new industrial users particularly in the initial years
of their establishment. The present tariffs for different categories of
consumers are listed in Table 2.5.

2.23      The average revenue per kWh has been dropping steadily due to
increasing usage for agriculture, for which the tariff is low.  At present the
national overall average is about 6.6 fen/kWh (US¢3.3).  The tariff is
considerably higher for the lighting consumers (US¢8.0/kWh), which is in line
with the national policy of discouraging consumption in domestic and
commercial sectors. The average selling price in China is below that of India
(US¢4.2/kWh), and considerably lower than in other (mainly middle income)
countries of the region:  Indonesia (US¢7.7/kWh), Thailand (US¢7.8/kWh),
Malaysia (US¢9.5/kWh) and Korea (USo9.6/kWh) in 1982.  Thus far however, the
relatively low tariffs in China have not prevented the electric power sector
as a whole from achieving satisfactory returns.
2.24      China's low and constant pattern of power tariffs need to be seen in
the context of low and constant prices for both its investment requirements
and for its cost of operation. The Bank plans to address the broad issue of
pricing in the context of its economic work rather than on an individual sec-
tor basis. The pricing issue is discussed in paras. 1.16 and 1.17.
H. Manpower and Training
2.25      As of the end of 1982, MWREP had about 2 million employees of whom
about 48% were directly under the Ministry and about 52% were under provincial
administrations. Table 2.6 gives the breakdown of staffing by functions and
by specialties:

2.26      MWREP has a problem with overstaffing of low-skilled workers./1  Of
the total numbers employed at end-1982, less than 30% have received formal
education beyond junior secondary school level. The percentage of technical
personnel has declined from over 9% in 1965 to about 8% at end-1982. Along
with the acute shortage of well-trained administrative staff, the average
productivity and efficiency per employee of MWREP is low./2
/1 Number of employees per MW installed in 1980 was 14.5, compared to
1.6 in Korea, 7.5 in Malaysia and 3.5 in Romania.
/2 Average GWh generated per employee in 1980 was about 0.8, compared to
2.3 in Korea, and 1.2 in Romania.

2.27      Since the late 70's, MWREP has established a long-term training
program to upgrade the quality of its existing staff at all levels. The
details of the Ministry's training facilities are given in Annex 6. Although
MWREP organizes the training program, much of the implementation is carried
out by the provincial power bureaux. The Ministry's ultimate goal is to
establish a comprehensive program by 1985 to provide training to existing
staff in a systematic fashion. MWREP is also sl:rengthening its capacity for
full-time training of potential employees through its Education Department
which sponsors 48 universities, 49 technical coLleges, television and
correspondence universities and 23 secondary vocational schools. These
programs are expected to lead to gradual improvements in the effectiveness
of the workers in the sector. The emphasis being placed on training by
MWREP is adequately addressing its needs in areas which are a part of a
nationwide problem occasioned by China's large population and the
curtailing of most formal training during the Cultural Revolution.
I. Planning and Investment
2.28      Regional and/or provincial planning is carried out by the regional
electric power administrations and the provincial electric power bureaux.
Overall planning is the responsibility of the Planning Department which
reviews for MWREP the plans proposed by the regi'onal administrations and
provincial bureaux on short-term (annual), medium term (5-year) and long-term
(10-15 year) bases. For major hydro projects, t:he investigation, planning and
design are carried out by the regional hydroelectric investigation and design
institutes under the supervision of the Water Resources and Hydroelectric
Power Construction Corporation. For system expansion and major thermal
projects, the study, planning and design are carried out by the regional
electric power design institutes under the supervision of the Power Planning
Institute. At the State level, the final approval of new projects, annual
budget allocations and project supervision are vested with the State Planning
Commission (SPC) and the State Economic Commission (SEC).  MWREP, like other
line ministries, operates under the overall supervision of these commissions
for project approval, budget allocation, financing arrangements and
supervision.
2.29      Table 2.7 indicates the investment in the power sector in the last
five years. It constituted about 10% of the total national investment for
capital construction. In 1982, 67% of the investment in the sector was for
generation and about 24% was for transmission and substation facilities.

/a Not including investment for subtransmission and distribution faci-
lities which are being financed by the provincial and municipal
governments (para. 2.35).
J. Sector Policy and.Strategy
2.30      The basic policy for the power sector :is to develop hydro
potential and coal-based thermal stations in accordance witb locally
available resources. The strategy adopted by the Government includes the
following:
(a)  the power industry should keep pace with industrial development to
ensure that demands can be met;
(b)  power grids should be planned and managed on an increasingly
integrated basis;
(c)  hydro development should be accelerated, particularly for rivers
with abundant hydro potential;
(d)  mine-mouth coal-fired thermal stations should be developed,
supplemented, where necessary, by stations located near
suitable port areas and load centers;
(e)  extra high voltage transmission lines should be developed
for remote hydro sites, mine-mouth stations and for inter-
connection between regions;
(f)  medium and low pressure thermal units should be replaced
progressively by larger size and higher pressure units to
improve fuel efficiency and oil-fired units should be
converted to coal-fired units to the extent practicable;
(g)  nuclear units should be developed in areas where other forms of
conventional energy are scarce; and
(h)  efficiency should be improved and conservation should be
encouraged.



- 18 
2.31      These strategies are in line with the national energy policy of
developing local resources and with the principle of putting equal stress on
development and conservation of energy.
K. Sector Issues
2e32      Problems and issues currently facing the sector are:
(a)  shortage of generating capacity;
(b)  inadequate transmission and distribution facilities;
(c)  financing constraints; and
(d)  technology transfer and training.
2.33      Shortage of Generating Capacity.  In spite of the considerable
growth in generating capacity, supply capability has lagged behind the demand
and shortages are reported in most regions - particularly in the Northeast,
North and East China grids. The power shortage was estimated at about
10,000 SW in generating capacity and 40,000 GWh in energy in 1982 which
caused a loss of 20% in industrial production. Demand management has been
carried out in these regions by staggering of holidays, shifting of working
hours and load shedding during shortages according to agreed priorities. As
a result, the North China Grid has increased its daily load factor to 86%
and annual load factor to 75% and the East ChLna Grid has achieved a daily
load factor of 90% and an annual load factor of around 83%. The overall
average running hours for thermal units in the country was around 5,500
hours, indicating a high degree of utilization and heavy burden on the
existing facilities.
2.34      Inadequate Transmission and Distribution Facilities.  The develop-
ment of transmission lines and substation facilities has lagged behind that
of generation.  The most common high transmission voltage is at 220 kV but
this is too low to permit significant power transfers over long distances.
There are only two lines of 330 kV (about 926 km) in Northeast and one line
of 500 kV (595 km) in Central China in operation. No interconnection has
yet been made between regions and there are about 10 provincial grids still
operating in isolation. MWREP has estimated that China has a shortage of
about 10,000 km of transmission lines at voltages above 110 kV. Similar
shortages exist in substation capacity. The present plan is to develop 500
kV lines for its backbone transmission system to be overlaid at a later
date, when and where feasible, by direct current or even higher voltage
transmission lines for regional interconnection.
2.35      Lower voltage subtransmission and distribution are currently being
financed by the provincial governments or municipalities. The local author-
ities usually do not allocate sufficient funds for the improvement and
extension of these facilities.



- 19 -
2.36      Financial Constraints.  Financial constraints have been one of the
main reasons for the shortage of generating capacity and the inadequacy of
transmission and distribution facilities. The most crucial issue is how to
finance the development and expansion of these facilities to meet the long
term needs. Up to 1981, all surpluses from operations including much of the
depreciation funds of the electric power administrations were transferred to
the State which in turn provided all investment funds for capital construc-
tion including projects for generation and transmission above 110 kV. As a
part of the financial reforms associated with the ongoing economic reform
and readjustment process, funds for these investments are now being provided
in the form of loans from the People's Construction Bank of China. Con-
straints in local financing and Government's prudent attitude in borrowing
from foreign sources have caused considerable slow-down of power projects.
The capital investment in the power sector was about 4 billion yuan per
annum in the past four years constituting less than 10% of the national
total.
2.37      Technology Transfer and Training.  Technology in least-cost invest-
ment programming, load dispatching and in the application of computers
appears, despite the progress already made, to be behind the prevailing levels
in developed countries. The age profile of the engineering staff is striking;
most of them are in their 50s and 60s. Strenuous efforts will be needed to
replenish the gap by training young graduates now emerging from universities.
This may involve the setting up of specialized training institutes, on-the-job
training within the country and training in utilities and institutions abroad.
This issue will be addressed by the Bank in due course in the context of a
sector related training program. A training component is included in the
loan to assist the beneficiary improve its training program and facilities
(para. 5.28).
L. Role of the Bank
2.38      The Bank's role in the electricity subsector will focus on transfer
of modern technology, staff training, institution building with emphasis on
system planning and long-term financial planning, and assistance in identify-
ing cofinancing. Bank projects will introduce modern construction methodolo-
gies, computerized monitoring of system operation and maintenance, training
of staff on site and abroad, and technical assistance for more effective
financial planning and management. Several cofinancing possibilities were
identified under the proposed project and resulted in the provision of
grants from Norway, Australia and Canada. In addition, the turbogenerating
equipment will be financed through export/suppliers' credits. The Bank will
also encourage the introduction of modern auditing procedures and interna-
tional competitive bidding (ICB) especially for civil works. With Bank
assistance, the Government has already developed interim guidelines for pro-
curement of civil works through ICB. Use of ICB for both equipment and
civil works will continue to be expanded as the Chinese gain more experience.
In the next few years, the Bank's lending in China's power sector will
particularly focus on hydropower developments, backbone transmission lines and
mine-mouth thermal stations.

III. THE BENEFICIARY
A. Organization, Management and Legal Status
3.01      Yunnan Provincial Electric Power Bureau (YPEPB), the proposed
beneficiary, is a state-owned enterprise responsible for the operation and
development of the electric power system in Yunrnan Province in southwest
China. Although it will ultimately become a part of the recently estab-
lished Southwest China Regional Power Administration which has its head-
quarter at Chengdu in Sichuan Province, for administrative purposes it
reports directly to MWREP in Beijing.  Eventually it is expected that the
regional administration will assume greater responsibility when the power
systems of the three provinces of Sichuan, Guizhou and Yunnan are intercon-
nected. In the meantime, because of the very large hydro developments
planned, the Ministry is taking a direct role int the sector's development
and in doing so has replaced the Yunnan Provincial Government which, because
of its limited resources, has been unable to fund the capital intensive
hydro developments.
3.02      YPEPB's organization is shown in Chart, 2.  It includes 9 power gen-
eration and distribution enterprises, a dispatch center and two enterprises
responsible for construction of thermal plants a.nd transmission/distribution
works. In addition, it has its own training schools and facilities for
maintenance and repairs.
3.03      Responsibility for the day to day management of the Bureau and
implementation of the plans and policies of MWREP is vested in a director who
is appointed by the Ministry after consultation with the State Council and the
provincial authorities.  Five deputy directors report to the director for each
of the following sets of functions: production and generation, thermal power
planning and construction, transmission and distribution construction, finance
and administration, and political affairs.
3.04      Hydro power developments are planned and coordinated by MWREP
through its Water Resources and Hydroelectric Pcwer Construction Corporation.
The design and construction of hydro projects is undertaken by organizations
which are directly controlled by the Ministry (para. 2.05). In the case of
projects in Yunnan, the Fourteenth Construction Bureau (FCB) is responsible
for construction and the Kunming Hydroelectric Investigation and Design
Institute (KHIDI) is responsible for design of hydro developments. During the
construction phase YPEPB has traditionally not been directly involved. It
assumes responsibility for hydro plants only after the construction phase has
been completed.
3.05      YPEPB was first registered as a state enterprise in Yunnan Province
in 1949. Each year since then, this registration has been renewed. However,
apart from registration, no document existed until recently evidencing the
Bureau's legal status, powers and responsibilities. During appraisal of
the proposed project, this question was discussed with MWREP, MOF and the
Bureau. The need was recognized to regularize the legal status of YPEPB to



- 21 -
enable the Bank to sign a project agreement with it. Accordingly, following
issuance of regulations governing all industrial enterprises in China, a
charter clarifying the legal status of YPEPB was approved and issued by MWREP
on November 10, 1983.
B. Staffing and Training
3.06      As of the end of 1982, YPEPB had 23,541 employees.  Table 3.1
gives a breakdown by specialties and by functional units:

Total                23,541            100
/a Includes financial staff.
3.07      Of the total staff employed by YPEPB, only 1,557 or 6% have received
technical training beyond secondary school level. YPEPB has an extensive
training program which is prepared each year and incorporated in its annual
plan approved by MWREP. It is implemented under the guidance and direction of
its Education Division.



- 22 -
3.08      There are three separate training institutions run by YPEPB; an
electric power vocational school, a technical college and a cadre school.
All of these institutions were set up or re-established in 1978/79, after
the end of the Cultural Revolution. They are mostly poorly equipped and
over-crowded. The vocational school trains secondary school graduates to
become technicians. It has about 500 students who undertake a 2-1/2 year
training program. YPEPB has plans to expand this school to accommodate
about 1,200 students by 1985.
3.09      At the technical college, about 360 students are enrolled in a
2-1/2 year program for training electricians and, other skilled workers. The
cadre school aims to upgrade administrative, financial, economic and other
skills of managers. Although about 1,000 of the power bureau's staff are
eligible for this type of training, only 40-50 are admitted to each
four-month course. YPEPB is also training about 170 junior power engineers
at the cadre school through television instruction. In addition to the
training provided at YPEPB's own facilities, a small number of higher level
staff (about 250 a year) are granted leave to engage in full-time training
in universities or research activities. However, for the majority of the
workers who have less than 9 years of formal education, training is provided
mostly on-the-job.
3.10      A training component has been included in the proposed project
(para. 5.28).
C. Accounting and Audit
3.11      YPEPB has annual and five-year production and investment plans which
are integrated with the national plans and are approved through MWREP by SPC.
Under the annual plan, materials, labor and funds are allocated to meet the
objectives established in the plans. The plans of operating enterprises
include parameters for monitoring their performance (para. 2.19). Monitoring
and measurement of performance is undertaken through comparison of actual
performance against the plan targets. Until recently, all funds required for
implementation of the annual construction plans were provided through alloca-
tions on a grant basis from the state budget, Operating funds were provided
on the same basis in the form of working capital funds.
3.12      Under China's economic re-adjustment program which began about 1980,
major changes are being introduced to encourage the economic use of the
Government's limited funds (para. 2.36). Funds for major new investments are
now being provided in the form of loans from the People's Construction Bank of
China. These loans are made only after projects have been extensively
reviewed and the cost estimates approved. The local banks are expected to
ensure that equipment, manpower and materials have been planned for
allocation. In addition to the introduction of construction loans at interest
rate of about 3% p.a., funds provided by way of non-repayable government
contributions for construction or working capital will also be subject to
finance charges (2.5% p.a. for working capital and 3.6% p.a. for capital
construction contributions). The construction loans will be repaid over 20
years after the end of the construction period out of net income and
depreciation arising from operation of the completed projects.



- 23 -
3.13      Each ot YPEPB's operating enterprises maintains its own financial
accounts which are consolidated with those of YPEPB. However, the construc-
tion enterprises maintain their own independent set of accounts. Accounts are
prepared on an accrual basis using the double entry system. Financial regula-
tions are established by MOF for all sectors.  These are supplemented by
detailed implementation procedures issued by MWREP. The MOF regulations cover
matters such as the accounting methods and procedures, form of accounts,
procedures for distribution of net income and depreciation, etc. These
regulations and accounting standards are being reviewed by MOF. Accounting
information is prepared in a timely fashion monthly, quarterly and annually.
Conventional accounting records are maintained by hand. YPEPB does not use
accounting machines or computers for preparing its financial reports. The
operating enterprises keep strict control over operating costs and conduct
simple variance analyses to establish the reasons for variations in costs from
planned levels.
3.14      One ot the anomalies in the tinancial planning system in China is
the absence of any long-term financial planning. This aspect is expected to
become increasingly important for YPEPB since it is now expected to repay with
interest its loan capital and operating funds. Furthermore, it will be
borrowing larger sums to finance major hydro developments. As part of the
Bank's involvement with the preparation ot Lubuge Project, a financial fore-
casting model has been furnished to MWREP. This has been used by MWREP and
YPEPB with the Bank's assistance to prepare long-term financial projections
which will enable YPEPB to study the impact of its expansion plans on its
future financial position.
3.15      The financial statements of entities in China have not been subject
to comprehensive audit. However various bodies have conducted checks to meet
their own particular needs: MOF, line ministries concerned, tax bureaux,
provincial financial bureaux and the banks. None ot these bodies prepare an
independent report on the accuracy and reliability of the annual financial
statements. There are no auditing standards or regulations or professional
body of auditors.
3.16      With the ratification of China's new constitution by the People's
Congress in December 1982, this situation has changed. Under the new consti-
tution, a State Audit Agency has been established. When fully functional it
will have the same status as a ministry and will report directly to the State
Council. Provincial audit bureaux are also being established in each province
and municipality (large cities). MOF has been responsible for establishing
the auditing bureaux and is drafting regulations and standards on the basis of
a comprehensive review, through study tours, of international auditing prac-
tices in other countries. Considerable progress has been made in educating
and training officials of the audit bureaux who have been drawn from MOF and
provincial financial bureaux. The Bank has assisted this process by
conducting a seminar to inform Chinese officials of the requirements and
guidelines for audit of Bank projects. Other technical assistance is being
offered from bilateral and UN sources and through the recently approved



- 24 -
Technical Cooperation Credit (No. 1412-CHA). Under this project, US$1 million
has been allocated to assist the State Audit Agency in training staff to audit
Bank projects.
3.17      The project expenditures would be certified by the Luoping Branch of
PCBC. This branch was established in 1975 to monitor the recording of the
Lubuge Project expenditures. During negotiations, YPEPB agreed to have its
annual financial statements and the project expenditures audited in accordance
with appropriate auditing principles consistently applied by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank and submitted to the Bank within six months of
the end of each fiscal year (Section 4.02 of the draft Project Agreement).
For this project, we expect that the Yunnan Provincial Audit Bureau will be
responsible for the provision of annual audit reports of YPEPB. The scope and
content of these reports would be reviewed progressively with the auditors as
their experience and capability expands.
D. Tariffs
3.18      The electricity rates applied in Yunnan province are given in Annex
7. They differ very little from the country-wide rates discussed in para.
2.22 and like the country-wide rates have not been changed for over 30 years.
Within Yunnan, electricity rates vary. For example: for lighting, consumers
of the Central Yunnan Grid have higher rates than normal, while users in
remote border areas have lower rates. In addition, certain industries such as
aluminum, steel and chemical enjoy preferential rates. The general level of
rates is adequate and enables YPEPB to produce satisfactory financial results
(para. 6.03). However, these rates do not reflect the long-run marginal costs
of supply from plants planned or under construction, e.g. marginal costs of
supply for the Yunnan power grid are estimated to be about 9 fen/kWh (Annex
23) compared to average tariffs in 1982 of about 6.6 fen/kWh. Further, since
rates have been fixed for many years, it is unlikely that they reflect the
costs of supply to the different consumer categories, especially agricultural
users whose rates are low (3.0 to 6.0 fen/kWh) and domestic users whose rates
are high (16.5 to 16.8 fen/kWh). YPEPB has agreed to seek increases in rates
in the context of the financial covenants with the Bank (paras. 6.14 and
6.15).
E. Insurance
3.19      During the Cultural Revolution in China, insurance companies did
not function. However, since 1980 basic insurance coverage has been
progressively re-established to afford protection against major risks such as
fire, flood, earthquake etc. Four principal kinds of protection have been
made available through the People's Insurance Company of China in Yunnan
Province covering fixed assets, goods in transit, motor vehicles public
liability and personal property. YPEPB has arranged basic coverage since 1980
against major risks with the Kunming Branch of the People's Insurance Company.
No claims had been made up to the end of 1982. For the Lubuge project, YPEPB
agreed to insure or make other provisions for the insurance of the project
facilities and equipment against all risks under arrangements satisfactory to
the Bank (Section 2.04 (b) of the draft Project Agreement).

IV. THE POWER MARKET AND THE PROGRAM
A. The Yunnan Power System
4.01      The total installed capacity of the Yunnan power system was
1,271 MW by the end of 1982, consisting of 754 MW of hydro (59.3%) and
517 MW of thermal (40.7%) (see Annex 8 for details). The total electricity
generation in 1982 was 5,360 GWh of which 2,510 CWh (46.8%) was from hydro and
2,850 GWh from thermal (53.2%). The system consists of two grids, the central
and the southern, operated at 220 kV and 110 kV respectively. The intercon-
nection of these two grids is presently made at the 110 kV level and it is
expected that they will be fully interconnected by 1985 after completion of
the 220 kV line.
4.02      In 1982 there were 8,799 km of transmisssion lines of which 704 km
were 220 kV, 2,074 km were 110 kV, and 6,021 km were 35 kV. The total
step-down substation capacity was 2,624 kVA: 760 kVA for 220 kV; 993 kVA for
110 kV and 871 kVA for 35 kV.
B. The Power Market
4.03      Before 1949, the electricity consumption in Yunnan was very low
with a total installed capacity of less than 10 MW. The peak demand has been
growing at an average annual rate of about 9.4% iin the 1960's and about 5.5%
in the 1970's. Growth rates in peak demand and energy generation over the
11-year period from 1972-1982 are shown in Table 4.1.
4.04      Of the 4,688 GWh total energy sold in 1982, 83.8% was consumed by
industrial users, 11.1% by agricultural users, 0.6% by transportation and
4.5% by residential and commercial users. System losses including station
use were 14.3% in 1982.

C. Load Forecast
4.05      YPEPB's load forecast was made by mearns of time regression analysis
for different categories of consumers on the basis of the past growth trends
adjusted by new large industrial loads expected to be connected to the system,
such as Dukou steel mill located in the southern part of Sichuan province.
4.06      YPEPB's forecast peak demands and energy requirements for the period
1982-1991 are shown in Table 4.2.
4.07       The peak demand and energy generation would increase from 916.5 MW
and 5,360 GWh in 1982 to 1,800 MW and 10,790 GWl in 1991, which represent
average annual growth rates of 7.7% and 8.0% respectively.  The growth of
energy generation would be slower in the first three years because of gener-
ation constraints and the effects of the economic readjustment process, but
would increase to 8-9% in the late 1980's due to the planned development of
heavy industries and the expected general improvement of econonic conditions.
The load forecast is realistic.

D. Development Strategy
4.08      YPEPB's strategy is to develop the indigenous resources particularly
the mine-mouth coal-fired thermal station at Kaiyuan and the renewable hydro
resources such as the Xierhe Stage III development and the proposed Lubuge
project based on the principle of a least-cost sequence of development. There
are a few good hydro sites within the reach of the grid such as Manwan (1,500
MW) on the Lancang River. However, Manwan is still in the investigation
stage, the preliminary design report for which will not become available
before mid-1984.
E. The 1982-91 Program
4.09      To meet the future load growth, the system will have to be expanded.
YPEPB's currently approved plan of expansion is shown in Table 4.3.

4.10      The balance of system loads and capabilities is shown in Annex 9
while the system development program is shown graphically in Chart 3. A re-
view of YPEPB's development program indicates that the program is the least
cost by utilizing the indigenous resources of coal and hydro potential and is
well balanced between demands and capabilities allowing for a reasonable
margin of reserve. The program beyond 1991 is still under investigation and
study.
4.11      A 220 kV transmission line is being planned to interconnect
Chuxiong with Dukou, an important steel mill center located in the southern
part of Sichuan.
V. THE PROJECT
A. Background
5.01      The project is located on the Huangni River, a tributary of the Nan
Pan River, about 220 km east of Kunming near the border of Yunnan and Guizhou
provinces and the Autonomous Region of Guangxi, (see Map IBRD 16866: China
- Yunnan Power System). It is the last stage of the seven-stage Huangni River



- 29 -
basin development. The first power project Dazhai (60 MW) was completed in
1978. The Agang reservoir is planned to be constructed in the later years
to provide yearly flow regulation. Field investigations of the Lubuge
project were started in 1964 by the Kunming Hydroelectric Investigation and
Design Institute (KHIDI). The preliminary design report was prepared by
KHIDI in 1978 and updated in 1981. The project was approved by the
Government of the People's Republic of China (GOC) in June 1981. Project
preparatory works such as access roads, construction camps and field
facilities are well advanced.
B. Project Objectives
5.02      The principal objectives of the proposed project are:
(a)  to provide generating capacity and energy to the Yunnan power grid;
(b)  to introduce modern technology in construction of dams, tunnels and
underground power houses;
(c)  to introduce ICB for procurement of civil works and associated
technical assistance;
(d)  to address financial and auditing issues;
(e)  to introduce financial forecasting;
(f)  to promote cofinancing with bilateral and export credit sources; and
(g)  to provide staff training.
5.03      The contribution of the project to the system is projected as
follows:

5.04      After completion of the Lubuge project:, it will become the master
plant of the entire Yunnan power grid providing peaking capacity and spinning
reserve to the system. Power will be sent to Kunming and Qujing areas.
C. Project Description
5.05      The proposed project will comprise:
(a)  construction of a rockfill dam about 100 m high, a spillway system,
an intake structure, a 9.4 km headrace tunnel, a surge tank, two
penstock shafts with steel lining, an underground powerhouse
tailrace tunnel, with a switchyard ancl provision of equipment
therefore;
(b)  provision and installation of three generating units of 150 MW each
with provision ultimately for a fourth unit;
(c)  provision and construction of two 220 kV transmission lines (single
circuit) of about 184 km each from Lubuge to Kunming and one 220 kV
transmission line (single circiut) of about 129 km from Lubuge to
Qujing with associated substations;
(d) consultant services for a Special Board of Consultants (SBC) and
construction management and supervision; and



- 31 -
(e) a training program.
5.06      The project data are given in Annex 10.
D. Cost Estimates
5.07      The estimated cost of the project is summarized in Table 5.2.
The cost estimates are based on mid'1983 price levels. Physical
contingencies include an overall contingency of 10% for civil works, 5% for
equipment and 10% for transmission facilities. The price contingencies for
foreign costs were calculated on the basis of assumed annual rates of
escalation of 7.5% for 1984, 7% for 1985 and 6% for 1986 and thereafter.
The price contingencies for local costs were calculated at 4% for 1984, 3.5%
for 1985 and 3% for 1986 and thereafter./l Detailed project cost estimates
are provided in Annex 11.
E. Project Financing Plan
5.08      The proposed Bank loan of US$145.4 million would meet about 25% of
the total project cost (net of duties and taxes) or about 58% of the foreign
exchange requirements. It would be used to cover the foreign costs of the
following items:
(a) civil works for the water conductor system;
(b) imported construction equipment and materials;
(c) equipment and materials for transmission lines and substations;
(d) electrical and mechanical equipment (other than turbines,
generators and auxiliaries);
(e) consultant services; and
(f) training.
5.09      The proposed financing arrangements are shown in Table 5.3:
/L Based on the mission's best estimate: (a) average annual escalation
of consumer prices from 1975 to 1980 was only 3% p.a.; and (b) price
escalation in 1981 and 1982 was about 4% p.a.

5.10      The proposed Bank loan would be made to GOC at the standard IBERD
variable interest rate (currently 10.08%) for a 20-year term including a
5-year grace oeriod and a front-end fee of 0.25%. COC would relend the
proceeds of the Bank loan to YPEPB under a subsidiary loan agreement at 8%
for 20 years including a 5-year grace period and YPEPB would bear the
foreign exchange risk.  A project agreement would be signed between the Bank
and YPEPB.  The terms and conditions for onlending the Bank's 'Loan were
confirmed with MOF at negotiations. Execution of the subsidiary loan
agreement between GOC and YPEPB and approval of the loan and project
agreements by the State Council would be conditions of loan effectiveness
(Section 6.01(b) of the draft Loan Agreement).
5.11      A grant of abcut US$11.6 million (. orwegian Kroner 90 million)
from the Norwegian Government has been committed by the Export Council of
Nurway to finance training, construction equipment, imported materials and
consultant services for construction management and supervision of the
underground powerhouse and taiLrace tunnel ('Para. 5.22).  Final arrangements
for the Norwegian grant are expected to be nagotiated in Beijing with GOC by
late February 1984.
5,12      The Australian Developmment Assistance Bureau (ADAB) has already
approved a grant of about US$1.3 million (A$1.4 million) for services being
provided by the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (SMEC) for project
preparation, bid evaluation and training. Additional assistance of about
Us$5.8 million (A$6.5 million) has been agreed in principle with ADAB to
finance the construction management and supervision services for the head-
works complex and water conductor system (para. 5.21), training (para. 5.28)
and the Australian and Chinese members of SBC for their subsequent visits to
China (para. 5.23).
5.13      The Canadian Government has agreed to provide about US$160,000
(C$200,000) to cover the cost of a Canadian national who would work as a
member of SBC.  An UNDP grant of about US$26,000 was utilized to finance the
first visit of two SBC members to China.
5.14      Export/suppliers' credits aggregating to about US$41 million would
be sought to finance turbines, generators and auxiliary equipment items.
5.15      All local costs of the project and interest during construction on
local and foreign loans including the proposed Bank loan will be financed by
loans from PCBC. MWREP has given assurance that it would meet any shortfall
in the financing plan to complete the project. At negotiations, the terms
and conditions on which local Bank loans would be provided were also
confirmed (para. 6.10(b)),
F. Procurement
5.16      Works.  The construction of the headworks complex (dam, intake and
spillway system) and underground powerhouse including tailrace tunnel will be
carried out by the Fourteenth Construction Bureau (FCB) of MWREP by using the



- 35 -
local procedure of assignment./1 FCB, which has been operating in Yunnan
province for more than 20 years, has constructed 13 dams and 9 underground
powerhouses, tunnels of various sizes aggregating 50 km in length and has
installed 54 generating units totalling 1,117 MW in capacity. We are satis-
fied that FCB has the capacity and capability for the construction of the
proposed project works in an efficient and economic manner. A cost control
unit supervised by consultants will be set up within the construction
management bureau (para. 5.25). The construction of the water conductor
system (headrace tunnel, surge tank and penstock shafts) will be procured
through ICB in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. Interim guidelines
for ICB for civil works on Bank financed projects have been formulated by
GOC to supplement the Bank's Guidelines to cope with the particular condi-
tions in China. Local labor and materials will be supplied by MWREP or its
authorized agencies at prices which will be uniform for both domestic and
foreign contractors. Fair competition will be given to all participating
contractors who prequalify, both domestic and foreign (see Annex 12 for
details). Civil works for the Lubuge project would be the first major civil
works contract in China to follow ICB procedures. This was selected as the
first test case because; (a) modern technology in construction and manage-
ment is required for the early completion of the water conductor system; and
(b) less complicated problems are envisaged in the supply of local labor and
materials for the water conductor works. A domestic preference of 7.5% will
be given when evaluating the bids of domestic contractors or the joint-
ventures eligible for such preference. The results of bidding of the water
conductor system indicate that foreign contractors can be competitive in
China under the conditions specified in the bidding documents.
5.17      Goods.  All equipment and materials financed by the Bank would be
grouped in appropriate packages and procured by ICB in accordance with Bank
Guidelines. For evaluation of bids of qualified domestic manufacturers a
preference of 15% or the import duty, whichever is the lower, would be per-
mitted. Spare parts costing less than US$100,000 per package would be pro-
cured through direct purchase up to an aggregate amount of US$1.0 million.
Equipment and instrumentation costing less than US$150,000 equivalent would
be procured through international shopping (with at least three quotations)
up to an aggregate amount of US$2.5 million.
5.18      Prior Review.  The bidding packages for main civil works (100%
coverage), construction equipment, transmission lines and substations and
electrical and mechanical equipment (other than turbines, generators and
auxiliaries), having an estimated value of US$200,000 or more would be
reviewed and commented on in advance of contract award by the Bank following
the procurement process as below:
/1   On the basis of a negotiated contract specifying the unit costs, terms
of payment, incentives for completing the work ahead of schedule and
penalty for delays in completion.



- 36 -
(a) advertisement;
(b) prequalification (for civil works only);
(c) bidding documents and addenda;
(d) bid evaluation and the proposal for award of contract;
(e)  contract documents which differ substantially from the proforma
contract included in the bidding documents;
(f)  major modifications to the contract.
G. Disbursement
5.19      Disbursement for Bank financed equipment and materials would be made
as follows: (a) 100% of the foreign cost of directly imported items; and
(b) 100% of the ex-factory cost for equipment and materials manufactured
locally. Disbursements on mein civil works would be 60% of total expenditures
(the estimated foreign exchaxLge component) and disbursements on consultant
services and training would be 100% of foreign expenditures. All disbursement
requests would be fully documented. Based on the construction schedule shown
in Chart 4, a schedule of estimated disbursements has been prepared
(Annex 13). Comparisons were made with disbursement profiles of hydroelectric
projects completed (a) in the Region; and (b) Bankwide. The estimated
disbursement figures are slightly higher than these profiles for the first
year as a result of the advance payments to civil works contractors for
mobilization (10% of the contract value).
5.20      The project is expected to be completed by December 31, 1989.  The
closing date of the bank loan would be June 30, 1990, which would allow
adequate time for payment of retention monies.
H. Engineering Services
5.21      The Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (SMEC) provided the
engineering services for construction planning, review of the cost estimates,
and preparation of tender documents for the civil works (Phase I and Phase II
services) on ICB basis. SMEC will be retained for assistance with bid
evaluation, contractual arrangements (Phase III) and construction management
and supervision of the headworks and water conductor system (Phase IV) under
a grant from ADAB (para. 5.12). Phase III services are estimated to require
about 44 man-months during FY83 and 84, at a total cost of about US$580,000
(excluding training and cost overrun for Phase I and II services). The
average man-month cost including salaries, international travel and subsis-
tence will be about $13,000. Phase IV services are estimated to cost about
US$4.8 million. The total consultant services and supervision are estimated
to comprise 4.4% of the project cost. At negotiations, agreements were
reached that YPEPB would retain the services of engineering consultants for



- 37 -
project preparation and construction management and supervision (Section 2.02
of the draft Project Agreement).
5.22      The Advisory Group of Norway (AGN) financed under a Norwegian grant
(para. 5.11) will provide consultant services for training, construction
management and supervision of the underground powerhouse and the tailrace
tunnel.
5.23      MWREP has established a Special Board of Consultants (SBC) to
review the project design, the proposed instrumentation and monitoring
program, the inspection and maintenance manual and to provide technical
advice during project construction. SBC would comprise four experts, one
Chinese and three expatriates, in the following fields: (i) design and
construction of hydroelectric projects in generaL; (ii) engineering geology;
(iii) design and construction of rockfill dams; and (iv) design and
construction of tunnels and other underground works. The first board
meeting took place in July 1983.
5.24      At negotiations, YPEPB agreed to undertake periodic inspections of
the dam and associated works constructed under the project with the assist-
ance of independent engineering experts whose qualifications and experience
shall be reviewed with the Bank. After each inspection, a report including
the conclusions of the engineering experts on the conditions and safety of
the above-mentioned works would be furnished to the Bank by YPEPB which
subsequently would make any necessary repairs or modifications in accordance
with appropriate engineering practices (Section 3.04(b) of the draft Project
Agreement).
I. Implementation and Construction
5.25      The Lubuge Project Construction Management Bureau (LPCMB) has been
set up to supervise the works to be carried out by FCB and contractors with
the assistance of SMEC and AGN. The organization of LPCMB is shown in Chart
5. At negotiations, YPEPB agreed to maintain the LPCMB with appropriate
staffing and authority to carry out the project. (Section 2.01 (b) of the
draft Project Agreement). Detailed design will be carried out by KHIDI.
5.26      Prequalification of civil works contractors was sought in August-
November 1982. Out of the 32 applicants, 17 foreign contractors were pre-
qualified and 2 domestic construction corporations succeeded in entering
into joint-venture arrangements with foreign contractors. Tender documents
for civil works for the water conductor system were issued in June 1983.
Bids were opened in November 1983 and contract award is scheduled to be made
in early 1984. The cost estimate was revised at negotiations to take into
account the bid prices. Procurement of turbines, generators and auxiliaries,
to be financed by export/suppliers' credit, is being processed in accordance
with local procedures (evaluation of quotations with financial terms from
prequalified suppliers on a present worth basis). Tender documents for
electrical and mechanical equipment (other than turbines, generators and



- 38 -
auxiliaries), will be issued in early 1985 to enable award of the contract
by late 1985. Main civil works construction will start in early 1984 and be
completed by mid-1989. Actual total construction time is about six years,
excluding the preparatory works. Diversion tunnels will be closed by late
1988. The reservoir, which will have a capacity of 100 million cu m, could
be filled within one month under average hydrological conditions. The first
unit will be commissioned in December 1988, followed by the second and third
units in June and December 1989 respectively. A fourth unit (not included
under the project) will be added after completion of the upstream Agang
reservoir. Tender documents for materials and equipment for transmission
lines and substations will be issued in late :1984 and awarded in mid-1985;
the transmission lines and substations are scheduled for completion by late
1988. A detailed construction schedule is shown in Chart 4.
5.L7      FCB had encountered some difficulties in obtaining land on the left
bank of the project site for construction facilities in the past. During
negotiations, MWREP has informed the Bank that: appropriate steps have been
taken to acquire all land required for carryirtg out the project.
J. Training
5.28      A comprehensive training program, estimated at about US$ 5 million,
will be included as apart of the project. The first phase (FY83-84), which
will be undertaken by SMEC and AGN as part of their consultant services, will
be directed at the staff of LPCMB, KHIDI and YPEPB in the areas of constru-
ction management, quality control, design, project accounting, cost control
and reporting on the implementation of the project. Under a second phase, a
long-term training program for YPEPB staff will be developed and training
tools and equipment for the expanded technical schools will be procured.
Financing of about US$800,000 for the second phase will be provided by ADAB
(para. 5.12). At negotiations, YPEPB agreed that it will carry out the
training program in accordance with arrangements satisfactory to the Bank
(Section 2.08 of the draft Project Agreement).
K. Ecology
5.29      The normal storage high water level for the reservoir is at El.
1,130 m, with an inundated area of 4.1 sq km and a length of about 20 km.
5.30      The reservoir's inundated area covers part of Luoping County in
Yunnan Province and part of Xingyi County in Guiizhou Province. In the
reservoir area, there are no mineral resources, forests, or fishery resources
of significant economic value. The region is suitable only for agriculture.
No environmental problems of significance are expected to arise as a result of
the project's construction. The losses incurred mainly involve the inundation
of farmland (about 54 ha of paddy field and 91 ha of dry farming land) and
seven villages with a total population of aboul 1,230. Reduction in crop



- 39 -
production is estimated to be about 330 tons per year. The losses due to
inundation are summarized in Annex 14. The benefits from the power generated
would far surpass these losses.
L. Resettlement
5.31      The total land acquisition, compensation and resettlement costs are
estimated at Y17.2 million (see Annex 15 for details). Considering the
level of annual income of farmers in China, the average of about Y 13,980 per
person is adequate.
5.32      The resettlement plan prepared by MWREP in consultation with the
local government of Luoping County, includes a provision for employment on an
irrigation project (including adding 11 m to the height of an existing dam,
construction of two main canals and a 55 kW pumping station) and the
reclamation of 75 ha of land which will be sufficient for the new settlers.
In the case of the people of Xingyi County, the plan is to resettle them in
different farming areas nearby. These arrangements are satisfactory.
M. Risks
5.33      The technical soundness of the project has been reviewed by SMEC and
SBC. An additional adit has been driven to confirm the alignment of the
headrace tunnel. SBC will be consulted if there are any unsolved design
issues. Regular visits by SBC during construction would provide advice on any
unusual technical problems.  The consulting services of SMEC and AGN will be
available to assist in construction supervision and management of contracts to
be awarded by ICB or by negotiations with FCB. No major difficulties are
expected during project implementation. Construction risks are expected to be
normal for a major hydroelectric project of this type.
VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Introduction
6.01      As a state-owned enterprise YPEPB is a self-accounting entity repor-
ting to MWREP. Its consolidated accounts summarize the financial position and
operations of the electricity supply industry in Yunnan Province. It is bound
by financial regulations issued by the Ministry of Finance for all state-owned
enterprises in China and by the procedures of MWREP detailing implementation
of MOF regulations. Being integrated with GOC's centrally planned economy
YPEPB and its various operating units have contributed most of their surplus
income and depreciation funds to the Government. All major new investments
have been financed, until recently, by government contributions.
6.02      Electricity rates have remained unchanged for the last 30 years
but have been sufficient to cover operating costs and to make substantial



- 40 -
contributions to government revenues. YPEPB had no long-term debt up to
1981. However, this is expected to change because as a part of GOC's
economic readjustment process, YPEPB is now expected to finance all its
major new investments in power generation plants through borrowing. In
addition, there will be charges for the use of government contributions
which will continue to be provided for financing transmission, distribution,
certain other capital expenditures and working capital (para. 3.12). The
long-term implications of these important changes on the financial outlook
of YPEPB are not clear and are not expected to be clarified until MOF
re-issues its financial regulations (which are currently under review).
B. Past Performance and Present Financial Position
6.03      YPEPB's income statements and balance sheets for the years 1978 to
1982 are set out in Annexes 16 and 17.  A summiary is given in Table 6.1 below:
Table 6.1: SUMMARY INCOME STATEMENT
(Year ending December 31, 1978-81)

Rate of return (%)                        12.4    13.3    11.0    10.9    10.0
Average net fixed assets in service        793     812      966   1,089   1,120
The income statements show that YPEPB achieved satisfactory operating
results and earned rates of return on average net fixed assets in service
(before revaluation) between 10% and 13%. During this period, operating
revenues grew at an average annual rate of about 3% compared to about 5% for
operating costs.  Average revenue and costs per unit sold were largely
constant except for depreciation which increased about 25% over the 5 year
period due to additions to the value of net fixed assets in service (up 47%
from about Y793 million in 1978 to about Y1,164 million in 1982). Fixed
assets have been valued at historical cost less depreciation (on a straight
line basis). There has been no revaluation of net fixed assets. However,



- 41 -
considering the low level of inflation experienced in China over the last
30 years (averaging about 1-2%), any revaluation of net fixed assets would
not require any significant adjustment to the rate base and therefore is not
being sought. On an unrevalued base, the operating results reflect a level
of :rofitabillty higher tl-.ari is being aehleved by most other electric ut4ilt-
ties in the East Asia Region (e.g. Philippines 6.2%, and Thailand 8.3%)
even though the average electricity rates (equivalent to about US¢ 3.3 per
kWh) are very low by comparison with other countries of the region (para.
2.23).
6.04      The balance sheet presentation reflects a segregation of funds into
three distinct categories comprising funds used for (a) financing fixed
assets; (b) working capital items; and (c) special fund investments. The
first two have traditionally been funded from government contributions while
the resources for special fund assets came from allocations from the net in-
come and depreciation retained by YPEPB. The balance sheets for the years
1978/82 show that the level of special funds retained each year is not
significant. In the 5 year period reviewed, only about 3% of total net income
and depreciation was retained. The remainder, which was well in excess of the
contributions received from the Government for new investments, was paid to
the government.
6.05      YPEPB's balance sheet reflects a number of unusual features.  The
normal debt/equity considerations have little relevance because YPEPB had no
long-term debt until 1981. The work-in-progress has been included in the
balance sheets in Annex 17 although YPEPB does not normally include it since
construction expenditures are recorded separately by the construction
bureaux. Expenditture on new works is only taken into account after a new
asset is completed and handed over to the power bureau for operation. Then
also only a part of hydro (75%) and thermal (93%) plant costs is capital-
ized. The remainder which is not considered to be part of the operating
asset is written off when the plant is commissioned. This comprises mobili-
zation and preliminary costs, the residual value of construction equipment,
cost of relocating construction teams, provision for pensions and medical
costs of retirees and project related training. During negotiations, YPEPB
agreed that it will include the full value of all fixed assets and work-
in-progress in its annual financial statements in accordance with accounting
practices acceptable to the Bank (Section 4.02(d) of the draft Project
Agreement). With full disclosure of these items, it should be possible to
establish YPEPB's financial position.
6.06      The level of working capital funds in theory is fixed but subject
to review about every 10 years. The last review for YPEPB was carried out
in 1978 and no further review is planned before 1985. A charge of 2.5% per
annum payable to the Government on working capital funds was introduced in
1981. If the established level of working capital is inadequate, additional
funds can be borrowed from the People's Bank of China. YPEPB's financial
statements show that it has maintained good control over the level of
working capital and has been able to avoid the need for short-term
borrowing.



- 42 -
6.07      YPEPB's use of special funds has grown from Y 31 million in 1978
to Y 47 million at the end of 1982. This growth is not significant and
suggests that YPEPB uses up most of these funds as they become available.
The procedures for distribution of retained earnings were revised in 1980 to
allow funds to be retained for specific purposes: workers' welfare up to a
maximum of 12% of total wages, workers' bonuses of about 10-12% of total
wages, plant improvements, research and training.
6.08      Depreciation rates for the electric power industry have remained
unchanged since 1956. The average rate for the industry has been 2.8%
annually. Although this rate appears lower than normally found in countries
with predominantly thermal based plant, it is adequate because most Chinese
plants have had to be kept in service longer.
6.09      From the above analysis of YPEPB's financial results over the last
5 years and its present position, no major weaknesses or problem areas have
been identified other than the need to take up the full value of fixed
assets and to include work-in-progress in its ba:Lance sheet which it has
agreed to do (para. 6.05). YPEPB's present financial performance and position
are sound.
C. Future Financial Performance
6.10      Financial projections have been prepared for the period 1983 through
1991 (see Annex 18-20) which is 2 years beyond the expected date of
completion of the project. The assumptions used for preparing the forecasts
are given in Annex 21. The most important assumptions used were:
(a) the historical value of all hydro and thermal plants was adjusted
as of the end of FY83 to reflect their full depreciated values.
From FY83 onwards, the full value of all completed projects was
assumed to be capitalized (para. 6.05);
(b) local loans from PCBC (including interest during construction)
were assumed to be at 3% interest p.a. and repayable over 20 years
after the construction period of each project;
(c) for the foreign components of the project, costs to be
incurred and debts to be serviced (including the Bank loan) have
been assumed to be converted at the internal settlement rate of
US$1.0 = Y 2.8;
(d) work-in-progress and the associated sources of funds have been
included in the projected financial statements; and



- 43 -
(e) all net earnings, depreciation and charges on government contribu-
tions were assumed to be available to meet interest and loan /1
repayments before remittance of any surplus to the Government. No
internal funds have been assumed for financing new project
construction expenditures.
6.11      All the above assumptions have been explained and discussed with
MWREP which accepted that they should be used for the purposes of financial
projections and reporting to the Bank during project implementation. The
Bank has been informed that MOF financial regulations are being reviewed
which may eventually lead to substantial changes in accounting pocedures and
practices adopted by industrial enterprises in China.
6.12      As discussed in paras. 1.17 and 6.14, it is expected that within
the forecast period power tariffs will be raised relative to prices in
general as part of the Government's adjustment and reform program and in line
with an energy policy that is giving and will continue to give considerable
emphasis to conservation. For the financial projections, the somewhat more
conservative assumption of an increase in power tariffs in line with the
projected increase in operating costs of YPEPB was adopted. This will
require that power tariffs be progressively increased from the current level
of 6.5 fen/kWh to about 8.0 fen/kWh by 1991.  On this basis the financial
projections show that YPEPB would continue to achieve reasonable rates of
return on its net fixed assets (without revaluation) and cover its debt
service commitments. The rates of return would range from a high of 8.6% in
1985 to a low of 5.3% in 1990 after the project is commissioned. By 1991 it
would recover to almost 7%. Debt service would be covered adequately, by
about 1.9 times in 1991.
D. Proposed Financial Covenants
6.13      While it is reasonable to project a generally satisfactory financial
performance for YPEPB by the time the project is commissioned, there are
several uncertainties and unknowns that could reflect adversely on perfor-
mance. It is conceivable that GOC could increase fuel prices, especially
coal, raise taxes, award higher payments to workers, increase costs of
materials and spare parts or step-up the interest charged on loans from PCBC
or on government contributions. Because no mechanism has been established for
/   Recent changes to the taxation of industrial enterprises in China
issued by the Ministry of Finance permit the deduction of debt service
payments before any remittance of taxes and profits. Net income after
debt services is distributed roughly as follows: 55% to the State as
income tax, 23% to MOF, 15% to MWREP and the remaining 7% to the power
bureau in the form of special funds (para. 6,07).



- 44 -
revising electricity rates in the event of escalation in costs, the Bank
sought YPEPB's agreement to covenants relating to financial performance and
debt limitation as set out in paras. 6.14 and 6.15.
6.14      At negotiations, YPEPB agreed to take all such measures, including
adjustments to electricity tariffs, to maintain gross revenue equivalent to at
least its total operating expenses (Section 4.03(a) of the draft Project
Agreement). The latter has been defined as the sum of all expenses related to
electricity operations, including maintenance, administration, depreciation,
interest and other charges on debt, repayment of loans, taxes, allocations to
special funds and other cash distributions and outflows (para. 6.07). In
order to meet this provision, YPEPB plans to seelk approval of the State
Pricing Bureau to increase electricity rates every three years by 0.5 fen/kWh
(USU.25/kWh) commencing 1985. These proposed rate increases have been
taken into account in the forecast income statements given in Annex 18
(para. 6.12). They represent the first sign that the Government is
considering to relax the fixed electricity pricing policy it has followed over
the last 30 years and may signify a willingness to allow power bureaux to
adjust rates to reflect changes in costs. In addition, YPEPB under MWREP's
direction is participating in a nationwide effort to increase productivity and
efficiency. YPEPB estimates that more stringent performance monitoring will
lead to an overall reduction in overhead costs of about 10% from 1984. If
savings of this order are achieved, YPEPB's financial performance will be
better than shown in the projections. The proposed measures aimed to increase
efficiency are evidence of the Government's interest in imposing greater
financial discipline in the sector - an objective which is in keeping with
that of the Bank.
6.15      In order to constrain borrowing and ensure that YPEPB's debt service
can be met from its own internal sources of funds, YPEPB agreed not to incur
any further debt if a reasonable forecast of its revenues and expenditures
shows that its projected internal cash generation would not exceed projected
debt service (Section 4.04 of the draft Project Agreement). In conjunction
with the financial covenants, YPEPB agreed to consult with the Bank by October
1 each year on its financial performance, annual plans, current and future
investment programs and measures it proposes to take during the following year
to comply with the financial covenants (Section 4.05 of the draft Project
Agreement).
VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Project Justification
7.01      A review of YPEPB's power development plan (1982-1991) indicates
that its generation program in the 1980's will require regular increases in
new plants to provide additional peaking capacity as well as energy. The
balance of system generation requirements and system capabilities is shown
in Annex 9. The need for additional capacity is demonstrated in Table 7.1.

/a The dependable peaking capacity of thermal UnlitS is the rated capacity
unless it has to be derated due to special reasons. Dependable peaking
capacity of hydro units is the working capacity during the peaking hours
corresponding to the firm power under a most critical hydro-year
condition.
/b Reserve requirement is calculated by assuming that the first and second
largest thermal units are out of service. (Additional capacity has
been provided in the dependable peaking calculation for the Lubuge
project).
/c The firm energy of thermal units is calculated at an annual capacity
factor of 68.5% (6,000 hours per year). The firm energy of hydro units
is defined as the annual energy output that would be available under a
most critical hydro-year condition.

7.02      Additional generation capacity would lbe required to be commissioned
by the end of 1988, otherwise the system would face a shortage both in
peaking capacity and energy, even in an average hydro-year. Interconnection
with the neighboring provinces would not solve the problem in the 1980s as
these provinces would also face similar difficuLties.
B. Least Cost Analysis
7.03      YPEPB's power development progam is fLrm up to 1987 with the
commissioning by the end of that year of the Xiaolongtan Unit No. 2 (100
MW). A review of potential hydro sites in Yunnan indicates the following:
Installed
Location      capacity    Annual
Name of site    proposed       proposed    output               Status
(MW)      (GWh)
Daima He        Nan-pan River      260     1,520   Under investigation
Daqiao          Nan-pan River      120        700            "
Manwan          Lanchang River  1,500      7,760   Under investigation and
planning
However, none of the above projects has been advanced to the stage where
they could be completed within the time frame tco replace the Lubuge Project
in 1988. Manwan is good for future development but not before 1992.
7.04      Three alternative programs were compared.  Program A is the basic
program including the Lubuge hydro project; Program B and Program C are its
thermal alternatives of mine-mouth coal-fired thermal stations using the local
coal at Kaiyuan. Program B would consist of two 100 MW and two 125 MW
thermal units while Program C would consist of three 100 MW thermal units and
three 50 MW gas turbines.
7.05      The comparison was made, on a constant price basis, between the
total present value of capital investment, operation and maintenance, and
fuel costs of the Lubuge hydroelectric project and the coal fired thermal
station at Kaiyuan. The SVT /1 approach to shadow pricing at border prices
was used as follows (system effects of the new units were taken into
consideration in calculating the fuel costs):
(a) all costs were at mid-1983 price levels;
/1 Method recommended by Squire and van der Tak.



- 47 -
(b)  taxes and duties were excluded;
(c)  official exchange rates were used to convert foreign currencies to
Renminbi;
(d)  for tradable goods with infinite elasticity, the c.i.f. price for
imports and the f.o.b. price for exports were used for estimating
the cost of local materials after making due adjustments for the
cost of inland transportation;
(e)  a conversion factor of 0.5 was applied to labor costs after due
adjustment for all the welfare benefits, bonuses and social costs;
and
(f)  for highly qualified staff including engineers and designers, the
shadow wage rate was calculated at four times the actual wage.
7.06      The present worth of the three alternative programs at varying
discount rates from 10-18% are shown in Table 7.2.
Table 7.2: PRESENT VALUES
(Yuan million)
Discount rate (%)
10    12     14    16    18
Program A - with Lubuge hydro                 770   711    659   615   577
Program B - with 2 x 100 MW &
2 x 125 MW thermal units          995   787    641   534   453
Program C - with 3xlO0 MW thermal units
& 3 x 50 MW gas turbines        1,109   860    686   560   467
7.07      Program A with Lubuge hydro project is more competitive than its
thermal alternatives Program B and Program C at discount rates of up to 13.6%
and 14.6% respectively. Program C has higher present worth than Program B at
all discount rates due to high fuel cost. Details are presented in Annex 22.
7.08      Sensitivity and risk analyses between program A and program B were
tested for variations in capital costs and fuel costs. As indicated in
Annex 22, the range of equalizing discount rates with 95% probability varies
between 12.8% and 15.3% with a distribution mean of 13.4%. This is satis-
factory.

7.09      Should the load growth be slower than projected, the electricity
generation by the Lubuge project would be utilized to replace generation
from existing thermal units. The return on investment for fuel replacement
alone would be about 8.5%.
C. Economic Rate of Return (Annex 23)
7.10      Based on estimated economic prices of input (capital investment;
associated transmission; operation and maintenance; and distribution costs)
and output (incremental power distributed), an [ERR of 12% was obtained.
Power was priced at tariff levels that were expected to be achieved in 1988
and 1991 respectively; no surplus benefits were taken into consideration.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      Specific agreements reached during negotiations of the proposed
loan were:
(a)  the Government agreed that it will reLend the proceeds of the bank
loan to YPEPB under a subsidiary loan agreement at 8% for 20 years
including a 5-year grace period. YPE]?B would bear the foreign
exchange risk (para. 5.10).
(b)  YPEPB agreed that it will:
(i)  have its annual financial statements and the Project
expenditures audited in accordance with appropriate
auditing principles consistently applied, by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank (para. 3.17);
(ii) retain the services of engineering consultants for project
preparation, construction management and supervision
(para. 5.21);
(iii) undertake periodic inspections oil the dam and associated
works constructed under the project (para. 5.24);
(iv) maintain LPCMB with appropriate staffing and authority
to carry out the works under the project (para. 5.25);
(v) carry out a training program in accordance with arrange-
ments satisfactory to the Bank (para. 5.28);
(vi) include the full value of all fixed assets and works-in-
progress in its annual financial statements in accordance
with accounting practices acceptable to the Bank
(para. 6.05);



- 49 -
(vii) take all such measures, including adjustments to electricity
tariffs, to maintain gross revenues at least equivalent to
its total operating expenses (para. 16.14);
(viii) not incur any further debt if a reasonable forecast of
its revenues and expenditures shows that its projected
internal cash generation would not exceed projected debt
service (para. 6.15); and
(ix) consult with the Bank by October 1 each year on its finan-
cial performance, annual plans, current and future invest-
ment programs and measures it proposes to take to comply
in the following year with the financial covenants in
(vi) and (vii) (para. 6.15).
8.02      Execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between the Government
and YPEPB satisfactory to the Bank and approval of the Loan and Project
Agreements by the State Council would be conditions of loan effectiveness
(para. 5.10).
8.03      Subject to the above agreements, the proposed project is suitable
for a Bank loan of US$145.4 million (including capitalized front-end fee) to
the People's Republic of China. The loan would be for a term of 20 years
including a 5-year grace period, and would be at the standard variable
interest rate.

Training Facilities of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power
The Education Department of the MWREF' is responsible for the over-
all coordination of the training program. It has developed a unified plan
which is implemented by the provincial power bureaux and their associated
enterprises such as power plants and distribution entities. The MWREP bears
most of the costs of the training program and selects the syllabus for
various disciplines.
The training program of the MWREP fits into three broad categories:
(i) full-time education for potential employees; (ii) full-time training for
existing staff; and (iii) part-time training for existing staff, which are
discussed in the following paragraphs:
I. Full-time Education for Potential Employees
(a)  Institutions of Higher Education
There are 48 universities (131 campuses) administered by the MWREP
which offer 4 and 5 year engineering programs in the fields of hydro and
electric power (28 related majors).
Over 6,000 new students are admitted annually: 3,000 to the 7
colleges directly under the MWREP, 2,000 to the 23 colleges under the
Ministry of Education and other related ministries, and 1,000 to the 18
colleges under various provincial power bureaux. There are approximately
6,000 graduates each year - two thirds in electric power related curriculums
and one-third in hydro related curriculums. About half of these 6,000
graduates are assigned to work for the MWREP. The balance is assigned to
other related ministries with a small percentage going on to graduate school.
There are 7 colleges with graduate programs. Each year approxi-
mately 170 students are awarded master's degrees and 10 awarded doctorate
degrees. A very small number (20 to 30) are sent abroad as exchange students
and visiting scholars.
(b) Vocational Schools
The purpose of these schools is to train mid-level technicians
for the MWREP. There are a total of 23 vocational schools, roughly one
per province. About 4,000 students are admitted annually and total
enrollment in 1982 was approximately 15,000.

ANNEX 6
Page 2 of 3
There are 27 majors in hydro and electric power related fields but
most courses are theoretical. Two types of training are offered by these
vocational schools: 2 to 2 1/2 year curriculums for senior secondary school
graduates and 3 to 4 year curriculums for junior secondary school graduates.
(c) Technical Colleges
The main objective is to train skilled workers for the MWREP.
There are 49 technical colleges: 1 in water conservancy, 26 in power
production (1 hydro, 25 thermal), 3 in power supply and 19 in power
construction (13 hydro, 6 thermal). Each year about 7,000 new students are
admitted and total enrollment in 1982 was about 14,000. These schools
provide 2 years of basic practical training for senior secondary school
graduates of which about 40% of instruction is theoretical.
II. Full-Time Training for Existing Staff
Each year a total of approximately 5,000 staff (2.5%) of the MWREP
are granted paid leave to attend college level institutions on a full-time
basis. The breakdown is as follows:
Regular colleges run by the MWREP             200
Workers' universities                       1,000
Correspondence universities                1,500
Television universities                       800
Technical colleges                          1,500
Total                                 5,000
III. Part-time Training for Existing Staff
(a) Periodic Training of Higher Level Staff
During every three year period, managerial (leaders and cadres) and
technical (engineers and technicians) staff is permitted to attend training
courses for 3 to 6 months. A number of short courses on management and
administration have been designed for the managerial staff. Technical staff
has the option to attend university courses or to carry out research on
their own on the latest developments in advanced science and technology,
management and administration or languages.

ANNEX 6
Page 3 of 3
(b) Training of Lower Level Staff
The intensity of training varies depending upon the educational
background of staff. For administrative personnel (13% of total staff) the
objective is to achieve a minimum education level equivalent to senior
secondary school or secondary vocational school. For ordinary workers (70%
of total staff), the goal is to attain a basic education equivalent to
junior secondary school level as well as technical skills in special trades.

LUBUGE HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
Procurement of Civil Works
Background
1.        Early in the Bank's relationship with MWREP, it was realized that
Bank/IDA financing of power projects would be limited unless a way could be
found to enable civil works to be financed under international competitive
bidding (ICB) procedures. To pave the way for Bank/IDA financing of civil
works in China, the Bank has assisted the Consttuction Panel of the State
Capital Construction Commission (SCCC) in drafting Interim Regulations
with a view to supplementing the Bank's Guidelines to cope with the parti-
cular conditions in China. It was also agreed with MWREP that civil works
for the water conductor system (headrace tunnel, surge tank and penstock
shafts) of the Lubuge project would be procured through international
competitive bidding as the first test case in China.
2.        The Interim Regulations were drafted by the Construction Panel and
reviewed by the Bank with a study tour mission (consisting of high level
Chinese officials) which visited Washington in June 1982. They were
finalized and submitted to the State Council of PRC for approval. In the
meantime, the tender documents for the Lubuge project (LUG C1) were prepared
by the Kunming Hydroelectric Investigation and Design Institute in
association with the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation of Australia.
Fairness was the basic principle adopted in the preparation of these
documents. Particular attention was paid to the supply of local labor and
materials, custom duties, and taxes.
Supply of Local Labor and Materials
3.        The tender documents specify that local labor and materials will
be furnished by the Fourteen Construction Bureau or other authorized agencies
of the MWREP in accordance with the terms set out in the Labor and Materials
Agreements for Contract and that all tenderers, domestic or foreign, shall
use the same costs for local labor and materials set out in the Annexes of
the Bill of Quantities which will remain fixed for the period of the
Contract.
Duties and Taxes on Construction Equipment
4.        The tender documents specify that both domestic and foreign
contractors will have to pay duties and unified industrial and commercial

ANNEX 12
Page 2 of 2
taxes (ICT) for imported construction equipment: and materials. Foreign
contractors, however, are permitted to provide a bond in the form of a bank
guarantee from the Bank of China equivalent to the sum of duties and
unified ICT. When the construction equipment is re-exported on completion
of the work, the foreign contractors will have to pay duties and unified
ICT on the difference between its value when imported and the depreciated
value of such equipment, after which the bond will be released.
Income Tax
5.        The tender documents specify that both foreign and domestic
contractors shall be liable to pay all income and other taxes as required by
the regulations of PRC which are in force during the contract. A comparison
of tax liability between foreign and domestic contractors indicates that
disparity is insignificant.

CHINA
LUBUGE HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
Assumptions Used for Financial Forecasts
For the purpose of financial forecasting which is expressed in
Renminbi, foreign components are converted at the assumed internal settlement
rate of US$1.0 to Y2.8.
A. Income Statement
(1) Sales of Electricity
The sales forecast is based on historical trends from 1953 to 1980
which showed a growth rate of around 4-5% per annum. From 1981 to 1985, the
period of economic readjustment in China, sales of electricity have been based
on the aggregate planned demands of industrial enterprises. Between 1983 and
1985, the growth of electricity sales is expected to average about 5% per
annum. After 1985, the growth rate is expected to be higher averaging about
9% per annum.
(2) Average Revenue
Average revenue per kWh sold is assumed at 6.5 fen for 1982 to 1984;
7.0 fen for 1985 to 1987; 7.5 fen for 1988 to 1990; and 8.0 fen for 1991.
(3) Fuel
The last coal price increase occurred in 1979. Base coal prices
are assumed to be unchanged through 1991. The following are the base fuel
(all coal) prices used in each plant for the forecasts (1983-91):
Power Plant           Price (Yuan per ton)
Xunwei                32.0
Pupingcun             45.0
Yangzonghai           46.6
Punshuidong           34.0
Kaiyuan               35.5
Xunjiansi             35.5
Xiaolongtan           34.0 (1986 on)
The above prices were escalated using the following rates: 4% for
1984, 3.5% for 1985 and 3% for 1986 and thereafter.



-76 -                         ANNEX 21
Page 2 of 3
(4) Other Operating Expenses
Thermal plant (excluding fuel), hydro generation, transmission and
distribution and administration expenses are based on YPEPB's historical
costs. Escalation was applied at the same rates as were used for fuel (see
para. 3 above).
(S) Taxes
Taxes are calculated at a rate of 6% of sales revenue plus Y 6 to
7 per MWh 11 of electricity sent out to the system.
(6) Depreciation
Depreciation is computed on the basis of gross fixed assets at the
beginning of the year at an annual average rate of 2.8%.
(7) Interest
It is assumed that all local loans for financing generation projects
are subject to compound interest of 3% per annum. During the construction
period this interest was capitalized and added to the loan amount. A charge
of 3.6% is also assumed on all existing government contributions used to
finance fixed assets.
The Bank's loan is assumed to be rele!nt to YPEPB at 8% interest
per annum, plus a front end fee of 0.25% and a commitment fee of 0.75%.
Supplier's credits are assumed to be subject to an interest rate of 10% per
annum.
/1  9% of 6.5 fen/kWh (FY82-84) and 7.0 fen/kWh (FY85-87) is roughtly
equivalent to Y 6/MWh; 9% of 7.5 fen/kWh (FY88-90) and 8.0 fen/kWh (FY91)
is roughtly equivalent to Y 7/MWh.



- 77 -                       ANNEX 21
Page 3 of 3
B. Balance Sheet
(1) Gross Fixed Assets
Gross fixed assets in service were adjusted to reflect their full
historical costs. No revaluation has been taken into account. The
commissioning dates for new units are given in para. 4.10.
(2) Long-term Debt
Local loans are assumed repayable over 20 years after the end of
the construction period. Amortization of the Bank loan is assumed to be on
standard World Bank terms; 20 years including 5 years grace. Suppliers'
credits were assumed to be repaid over 10 years after 3 year grace.
C. Funds Statement
(1) Construction Expenditures
Expenditure on new investments excluding Lubuge was escalated at
4% for 1984, 3.5% for 1985 and 3% for 1986 and thereafter. For Lubuge, local
costs were escalated at the above rates and foreign costs as follows: 1984 -
7.5%; 1985 - 7%; 1986 and thereafter - 6%.
(2) Borrowings
All new expenditures for power generating projects were assumed to
be financed by PCBC loans except for the Lubuge Project where the financing
proposed in paras. 5.08-5.15 (Project financing plan) was adopted. All
transmission, distribution and other investment expenditures were assumed to
be financed by Government contributions (subject to a charge of 3.6% per
annum).

LUBUGE HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
Least Cost Analysis
Selection of Alternatives
1.        The alternatives to the Lubuge Hydroelectric Project would be
either a thermal or hydroelectric development. However, no other hydro
projects have advanced to such a stage that they, could be completed within
the time frame to replace Lubuge. Manwan, YPEPE's next major hydroelectric
undertaking of about 1500 MW capacity, is still under investigation and
planning.
2.        The only feasible alternative would be a mine-mouth coal-fired
thermal station utilizing the local coal at Kaiyuan. The following three
alternative programs were selected for comparison:
Program A                 Program B                Program C
1986     Xiaolongtan thermal        Xiaolongtan thermal      Xiaolongtan thermal

No. 2 & 3 (2x 150 MW)    No. 3 & 4 (2x125 MW)    No. 3 (100 MW) and
Gas turbines
(3 x 50 MW)
3.        Associated transmission facilities were taken into consideration.
Capital Cost
4.        All costs were based on mid-1983 price levels.  Shadow pricing
was applied as follows: (i) taxes and duties were excluded; (ii) official
exchange rates were used to convert foreign currencies to Renminbi; (iii)
border prices provided by the Construction Panel of the State Economic
Commission were used for local materials (see Table 1 at the end of this
Annex); (iv) a conversion factor of 0.5 was applied to labor costs after due
adjustment for all the welfare benefits, bonuses and social charges; and
(v) for highly qualified staff including engineers and designers, the shadow
wage was calculated at four times the actual wage.



- 79 -                        ANNEX 22
Page 2 of 5
5.        The capital cost for alternative programs after shadow pricing was
estimated as follows:
Associated                         Unit Cost
Plant         Transmission           Total        Per kW
------------- (Y Million) --        ------         (Yuan)
Program A       952.7            66.2                 1,018.9      2,269.0
Program B       450,0            53.5                   503.5      1,119.0
Program C       410.8            53.5                   464.3      1,032.0
Operation and Maintenance Costs
6.        The O&M costs were based on a fixed percentage of the capital
cost for different types of projects.
O&M (%)
Hydro project                     1.0
Thermal project                   3.0
Gas turbine                       2.0
Associated Transmission           1.0
Fuel Costs
7.        System effects were taken into consideration in calculating the
fuel costs. The coal consumption of the new thermal alternative and the
existing thermal units which the Lubuge hydro project can replace was
estimated as follows:
Heat             Coal
Plant                             Rate           Consumption
(Btu/kWh)          (kg/kWh)
New Thermal                       11, ooo           0.40
Existing Thermal Units            12,500             0.45
Gas turbines                      13,500            - /a
/a Using distillate oil at Yuan 675 per ton.

8.         The coal was based on mid-1983 prices at Yuan 80 per ton which was
the border price after adjusting for inland transportation. The cost of
coal was assumed to be rising in real terms at 1.5% p.a. from 1983-2009 and
1% p.a. from 2010 and thereafter.
Results of Analysis
9.         The analysis was made by using the discounted cash flow method.
The total present worth (in million yuan) of Programs A,B and C at different
discount rates is as follows:

10.       Program A with the Lubuge hydro project would be competitive with
the thermal alternative at discount rates up to about 13.6% for Program B and
14.6% for Program C. Program C has higher present worth than Program B for
all discount rates due to high cost of distillate oil.
Sensitivity Test
11.       Sensitivity tests between Program A and Program B were made con-
sidering variations in capital costs and coal prices as follows:
Equalizing discount rate
(a) Lubuge hydro
at base cost                               13.6%
10% increase in capital cost               12.3%
20% increase in capital cost               11.2%
(b) Thermal alternative
at base cost                               13.6%
10% decrease in capital cost               13.0%
20% decrease in capital cost               12.5%
(c) Coal Price
10% decrease in coal price                 12.7%
20% decrease in coal price                 11.8%
Risk Analysis
12.       Risk analysis comparing Lubuge hydro with the thermal alternative
was made following the sensitivity tests. The range of cost variations and
the probabilities associated with each variable were assumed as follows:
Range of Cost Variation probability        -10%       0      +10%       +20%
Lubuge Hydro                         0.05      0.70    0.20       0.05
Thermal Alternative                  0.10      0.80    0.10       -
Coal price                           0.10      0.80    0.10       -
13.       The range of equalizing discount rates with 95% probability varied
between 12.2% and 14.2% with a distribution mean of 13.4% and a standard
deviation of 0.63%.

LUBUGE HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return
General
1.         The economic rate of return (IERR) was calculated by equalizing the
present value of the economic costs and benefits attributable to the project.
The analysis was made on an incremental basis using 1982 as the base year.
Costs
2.         Same method of shadow pricing as detailed in the least cost
analysis was used.
3.         Capital Costs.  The costs are net of taxes and duties and include
the full costs of the project and associated transmission costs. Annual
disbursements are given below:

5.        The Lubuge hydro project will produce a dependable peaking capacity
of 307.3 MW and an average energy output of about 2,450 GWh at an annual
load factor of 62.2%. Actually the Lubuge plant can generate the full
capacity at any time and will become the master plant of the entire grid
providing peaking capacity and spinning reserve to the system. This effect
has not been taken into consideration in the economic analysis.
Benefits
6.        Quantifying the benefits of power projects is difficult in all
countries and particularly so in China, where tariffs and most other prices
are not subject to economic pressures and where most power is administratively
allocated.' It is accepted by all, however, that shortages of electricity are
currently constraining China's industrial production (causing under-capacity
operation) and will continue to do so into the 1990s /1. This suggests that
the economic benefits of increased power supply will be substantial - average
gross agricultural and industrial output per kWh of electricity consumed is
about Y 2.5. The benefits to the project were calculated on the following
four alternative assumptions: (i) using current tariffs (fen 6.5 per kWh) as
the minimum proxy of economic benefits; (ii) using projected tariffs by 1989
to produce an acceptable rate of return on net fixed assets (fen 8.0 per kWh
in 1991 and thereafter); (iii) tariffs be inc:reased, approaching the long-run
marginal cost of fen 9.0 per kWh by 1989 (see Table 1); and (iv) the average
economic benefits per kWh of electricity sales over the life of the project be
at least 50% greater than the current tariffs./2
7.        The incremental sales attributable to the project are equal to the
power generated by the project after adjusting for generation, transmission
and distribution losses.
Economic Rate of Return
8.        The economic rate of return (IERR) of the project is the discount
rate which equalizes the present value of the economic costs and benefits.
Based on four alternative measurements of benefits mentioned in para. 7, the
IERRs thus calculated are as follows:
Average tariffs             IERR
(fen/kWh)                 (%)
6.5                   10.0
8.0                    12.0 /a
9.0                   13.5
9.8                   14.5
