The project\n            achieved its overall objectives, its impact has been\n            significant, and both the Bank and Borrower performed\n            satisfactorily. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, the Bank's monitoring and progress\n            report requirements should be simplified and made less time\n            consuming. Second, if the Bank is to be involved with the\n            functioning of the TA, additional staff weeks should be\n            devoted for supervision of the TA credit both at the RMP and\n            in Washington. Third, a simplified set of procedures for\n            subprojects needs to be developed, particularly to ensure\n            that routine administrative matters do not need the review\n            and approval of a relatively large number of entities.\n            Fourth, the project director of TAPC should have greater\n            authority vested in him to decide on most matters relating\n            to the award of studies, disbursements, and other\n            administrative matters. Fifth, for each subproject, one\n            organization should be invited to take the prime technical\n            responsibility for the product. Lastly, commitment by the\n            Government to the concept and objectives of the project is\n            essential for effective functioning of the project."}, "docdt": "1991-10-03T00:00:00Z"}
