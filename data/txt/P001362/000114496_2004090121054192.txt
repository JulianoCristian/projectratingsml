                       Description of the Project
     The objectives of the Project are to support the Borrower's
education sector adjustment program as it pertains to the universities
and teacher training centers by: (i) rationalizing and strengthening
the institutional framework for higher education in both the public
and private sectors; (ii) limiting the growth of the Borrower's
budgetary resources devoted to the Public Universities by promoting
cost sharing and improved investment planning; (iii) improving the
quality of teaching and research at the Public Universities, and
(iv) improving primary teacher training colleges.
     The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such
modifications thereof as the Borrower and the Association may agree
upon from time to time to achieve such objectives:
Part A:   Institutional Strengthening
1.   Strengthening CHE to enable it to undertake the task of planning,
programming and budgeting for Public University development.
2.   Carrying out studies including:
     (a)  a graduate labor market study;
     (b)  a study of the future development of the private university
sector; and
     (c)  a socioeconomic study of access to the universities and of
subsequent performance, particularly in respect of equity and gender
issues.
3.   Carrying out selected applied research projects relevant to the
Borrower's economic development.
4.   Reforming the Student Loan Scheme.
Part B:   Public Universities
     Carrying out at the Public Universities of subprojects in three
phases, involving: (1) institutional development, including the
establishment of management information systems; (2) staff development
in key areas for academic, technician, administrative and service
staff; and (3) the acquisition of teaching and related equipment
including computers, laboratory and workshop equipment, books and
journals, telephone systems and vehicles.
Part C:   Primary Education
     Construction and equipping of seven new primary teacher training
colleges, with a total capacity of 4,080 trainees.
                                   * * *
     The Project is expected to be completed by December 31, 1997.
