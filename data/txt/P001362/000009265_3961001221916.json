program to consolidate and\n            develop the universities by:  (a) rationalizing and\n            strengthening the institutional framework for higher\n            education, in both the public and the private sectors; (b)\n            limiting the growth of government budgetary resources\n            devoted to the public universities by promoting cost sharing\n            and improved investment planning; and (c) improving the\n            quality of the teaching and research delivered at the public\n            universities.  The project consists of two major components.\n            At the central level, it will strengthen the Commission for\n            Higher Education, reform the Student Loan Scheme, carry out\n            relevant studies, support applied research, and implement\n            the project.  At the six public university institutions, the\n            project will support subprojects concerned with\n            institutional development, staff development in key areas,\n            and the supply of teaching and related equipment, especially\n            for science and engineering."}, "docdt": "1991-10-07T00:00:00Z"}
