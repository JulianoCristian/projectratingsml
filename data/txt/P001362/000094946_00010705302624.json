Nonetheless, the institutional\n            innovation, represented by the Higher Education Loans Board,\n            showed a steady improvement in loan recovery performance,\n            and, greater coordination of public universities, with the\n            creation of a culture planning, were positive aspects. The\n            uncertain sustainability needs to be addressed, namely, at\n            financing policies, and, at departmental levels, where\n            equipment, and library materials were delivered. The key\n            lessons address, first, general applicability, which\n            indicate the disadvantaged position of a Project\n            Implementation Unit being responsible for several projects\n            at a time, thus diminishing accountability to stakeholders,\n            in comparison to a single operation focus. Project design\n            should reflect the procurement, and financial management\n            capacity, as well as monitoring of development objectives,\n            to be assessed at appraisal. Secondly, university projects,\n            should contain a balanced design between responsibility\n            decentralization to universities, and central coordination.\n            This could have an impact through the full engagement of\n            Vice-Chancellors, to achieve better policy reforms, and,\n            financial accountability."}, "docdt": "1999-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
