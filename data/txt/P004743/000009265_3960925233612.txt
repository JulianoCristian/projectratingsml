PROJECT COMPLETION REMT
THAILAND
THIRD AUBBER REPLANTING PROJECT (LN.2691-THL
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Third Rubber
Replanting Project in Thailand, for which a loan of US$60.0 million equivalent
was signed June 30, 1986. (All references to the Bank's loan amount in the text
and tables of this report are in US$ equivalent.) The project was jointly
financed with the Commonwealth Developmenc Corporation (CDC), which provided a
loan of £10.0 mill$on. The Bank loan Closing Date was September 30, 1991. The
final disbursement was made on July 17, 1990, and the loan was fully disbursed.
Concurrently, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) provided grart
assistance of US$168,300 for technical assistance and training.
Parts I and III of the PCR were prepared by the Agriculture
operations Division of Country Department I of the East Asia and Pacific Regional
Office, based on a preliminary report supplied by the Office of the Rubber
Replanting Aid Fund (ORRAP) and Bank records. On February 19, 1992, the Bank
sent the draft PCR to the Borrower with a request to prepare Part II. The
Borrower responded that its comments had been incorporated in the preliminary
report; therefore, there was no need to preparo a separate Part II.
The Bank expresses its appreciation to the officials of ORRAF, the
Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOAC), other supporting Government
AgencLes, the UNDP, and the Commonwealth Development Corporation for their
valuable cooperation ln the successful lmplementation of the project.

Third Rubber Remiantina Proie.t (Loan 2691-TEl
Evaluation Summary
BackqKond
1.        The Third Rubber Replanting Project financed under Loan 2691-TH
continued Bank support for a successful rubber replanting project initiated by
the Royal Thai Goverment (RTG) in 1960. Specifically, the project included
support fors (a) a four year time-slice of the Office of the Rubber Replanting
Aid Fund's (ORRAF) agricultural development program, including new rubber
replanting of 50,000 ha per year and bringing past replantings to maturity (about
290,000 ha); (b) OED '  related field administration management and training
costs; and (o) technical assistance to improve ORRAP's organization and
management structure.
Project Obiectiveg
2.        The main objectives of the project were:  (a) to increase the income
level of rubber smallholders who are mostly farming relatively poor soils in
rainfed areas; (b) to improve the country's balance of payments by increasing
rubber exports; and (c) to promote institution building and improve efficiency
in ORRA.
Proiect Design and OrgaXization
3.        Project design was simple, based on the sound foundation laid by two
previous projects. Bank missions visited Thailand in October 1983 and January
1984 to identify and prepare the project. The Food and Agricultural Organization
of the United Nations/World Bank Cooperative Program (EAO/CP) participated in the
October mission and the Commonwealth Development Corporation, UK (CDC) in the
January mission. As with the two earlier projects, the three main implementing
agencies were: (a) Rubber Research Institute of Thailand (RRIT) - responsible
for research and production of foundation stock of quality rubber; (b) Department
of Agricultural Extension (DOAR) - responsible for extension and farmer training
after the trees come into production; and (c) ORRAF - responsible for supply of
inputs, administration of a rubber replanting fund, general extension and farmer
training before the trees come into production, and overall coordination of the
project.
4.        Experience from the earlier projects showed that it was necessary to
modify ORRAF's organization and management structure, especially to: (a) improve
the cost effectiveness of its operations; (b) improve rubber growing technology
for different growing zones; (c) increase the period of ORRAE assistance from



- iv -
5-1/2 years to 7-1/2 years to reduce the incidence of premature tappingp and (d)
rovise the planting program to reach a larger number of needy rubber farmers.
Proiects Cost and  iancgi
5.        The total project cost (US$309.2 million) was about 20% higher than
the appraisal estimate (US$258.6 million) due mainly to higher costs for
chemicals, labor, vehicles and equipment. The Bank loan of US$60.0 million
equivalent was signed June 30, 1986 and became effective October 22, 1986. The
Commonwealth Development Corporation co-financed the project with a loan of £10.0
million, estimated at appraisal at US$14.5 million but ultimately realizing
US$18.38 due to appreciation of the Pound Sterling.  At the Borrower's request,
UNDP provided grant assistance of US$168,300 to finance technical assistance and
training which originally would have been provided through the Bank loan.
Proieat Implementation
6.        Project implementation proceeded satisfactorily.   Thb  total area
replantei over the five year period (FY1987-PY1991) was 194,164 ha or 97% of the
original tax-et of 200,000 over a period of four years. The annual replanting
target of 50,000 ha per year could not be fully achieved, mainly becease the
grant of r z;ght to farm (Sor Tor Kor) certificates, which would support about
10,000 ha per annum in gazetted forests, did not materialize.
7.        Farmer training in nursery and field operaltiov  was successfully
carried out jointly by the three Amplementing agencies, with ORRAF extending the
period of farmer assistance from 5-1/2 years to 7-1/2 years.  ORRAF also
continued to implement the cost affective measures initiated under the Second
Rubber Replanting Project by suspending fertilizer transport subsidies, procuring
more economical herbicides and supplying farmers with fertilizers with a higher
concentration of nutrients to reduce transportation and storage costs.  Of
particular significance is the fact that ORRAF cut back on its nursery
operations. Under the project, farmers' supply of planting materials increased
from 63% of total requirements to 76%, while ORRAF's supply declined from 14% to
8t and private nurseries from 23% to 16%.
8.        Increased efforts were made to identify and meet the needs of the
poorest small farmers by modifying replanting questionnaires, revising staff
performance targets, providing incentives to permit a better selection of
farmers, and by establishing group processing and marketing centers to promote
marketing. OPRa has also been sponsoring a pilot marketing project aimed at
eliminating intermediaries and providing for direct contact between factory and
farmers and for immediate payment to smallholders.
9.        In compliance with the Loan Agreement, the Government amended the
ORRAP Act and set the cess on export rubber at a flat rate of Baht 1. 70 per
kilogram which would have ensured the self-sufficiency of the Rubber Replanting
Fund. However, in response to farmers' demonstrations against low rubber prices,
the Government suspended the rubber cese and the export tax on rubber in December
1989. Suspension of the cess remained in effect until July 1990, when it was re-



introduced at a rate of Baht 0.60 from July 21, 1990 to May 31, 1991 and then at
Baht 0.90 since June 1, 1991. The export tax hae not been re-imposed. As a
consequence of these actions, the Rubber Replanting Fund will cease to be self-
sufficient after FY1994.
Proiest Results
10.       The total area replanted under the project was 194,164 ha, about 97%
of the appraisal target. Total incremental production is expected to be about
S.9 million tons valued at about US$4.2 billion (in 1990 constant dollars)
compared with appraisal estimate of 4.1 million tons valued at US$3.8 billion.
The re-estimated economic rate of return is about 16% compared with an appraisal
estimate of 18%, due mainly to lower rubber prices.
11.       The income distribution and poverty goals of the project are being
achieved, although at more modest rates than expected at appraisal. Some 118,258
plots with average plot size of 1.6 ha were replanted, compared with an appraisal
estimate of 167,000 plots with average size of 1.2 ha. NGnetheless, the average
of 1.6 ha is less than the average plot size of 1.8 ha under the previous
project, which indicates that smaller farmers are benefitting more from th'
project. Per capita incoue at full development is expected to be about the same
as the appraisal estimate of Baht 14,000, compared with the average per capita
income from agriculture of Baht 8,000 and rural poverty level of Baht 4,700.
Project Sustainabilitv
12.       There is little doubt that the project is technically sustainable.
The trees have been properly established, the farmers have been well trained and
the level of field husbandry is high. The main project risks are related to the
low price of rubber and the viability of the replanting fund. Although the
rubber price has been low since mid 1989, the Bank forecasts moderate recovery
over the next 13 years.. The Government needs to progressively increase the
rubber coss to the level necessary to ensure the financial sustainability of the
replanting fund.
Findinos and essons Learned
13.       The following lessons learned in the course of implementing this
project ma- be relevant to similar tree crop pro4eCts in Thailand and elsewhere:
(a)  an effective organization should be:   (i) responsible for both
dissemination of technical information and coordination of the supply
of improved planting materials and other inputs; and (ii) financially
stable;
(b)  there should be a clear delineation of functions among project and
executing agencies;
(c) good arrangements for timely collection and marketing of output are
essential;



- vi -
(d) farmers must have appropriate incentives to replant and to adopt
improved technologies; and there must be adequate measures to meet
their subsistence needs during the immature stage of the rubber trees,
and
(e) the approach to financing long-term smallholder tree crop replanting
in Thailand (as in Malaysia and Sri Lanka) has proven far more
effective than have rural credit schemes for this purpose elsewhere.
Of course, the rates must ba set at a level adequate to ensure the
long-term financial sustainability of the replanting fund, even if
occasional Government subventions are necessary on poverty alleviation
grounds during years of extremely low world market prices.

Name:             Third Rubber Replanting Project
Loan Number:      2691-TH
RVP Unit:         East Asia and Pacific
Country:          Thailand
Sector:           Agriculture
Subsectors        Tree Crops
2.   Backaround
2.1       Agriculture has played an important, though declining, role irn the
economy of Thailand.  At project appraisal (May 1985), Thailand's agriculture
sector accounted for 25% of GDP, 60% of exports and 70% of employment. Tree
crops accounted for about 15% of the planted area and a similar proportion of the
total of value of agriculture production. With the exception of those engaged
in oil palm, tree crop farmers in Thailand were predominantly smallholders.
Because rubber grows better in poor soils than do many other cash crops like
maize and sugar cane, and provides a year-round income, it had become the main
source of agricultural production and poverty alleviation in the more humid areas
of Southern Thailand. About 530,000 farm families engaged in rubber growing, but
at least 5 million people actually benefitted directly from rubber, as planters,
tappers, traders and processors.
2.2       Despite  its  advantages,  rubber  can  be  a  difficult  crop  for
smallholders, because it has a long immature period, high establishment costs and
must be replanted about every 30 years.  Therefore, the Office of the Rubber
Replanting Aid Fund (ORRAP) was established in 1960 under the ORRAY Act to
organize small farmers to reolant senile low yielding or abandoned rubber with
high yielding varieties. ORRAP administers a Replanting Fund which receives its
income from a cess levied on rubber export, supplemented when necessary by
Government subventions. ORRAP provides both technical and financial support to
smallholders.  Replanting assistance is provided in kind (high yielding clonal
materials, fertilizers and agro-chemicals) and in cash (payment in fixed amounts
for smallholders' labor after completion of specified tasks) before the trees
come into production.
2.3       The Bank had supported ORRAP's activities through two previous loans.
The first, for the Rubber Replanting Project (LN.1243-TH for US$50 million),
became effective in January 1977 and was closed in December 1982. The second,
for the Second Tree Crops Project (LN.2078-TH for US$142 million), became
effective in October 1982 and was closed in February 1987. CDC co-financed both



-2-
these projects in the amount of US$6.8 million and US$21.2 million equivalent,
respecti.ely.
2.4       The area replanted under the first project was 250,6S4 ha with about
225,000 beneficiaries. The area under the second project was 235,955 ha with
about 131,000 beneficiaries. Both projects were successfully implemented and had
satisfactory results.
3.        Pioiect Obiectives and Descrintion
3.1       As with the previous projects, the main objectives of the third
project were: to increase the income levels of rubber smallholders who mostly
farm relatively poor soils in rainfed arease to improve the country's balance of
payments by increasing rubber exports; and to promote Institution building and
improve efficiency in ORRA". Of particular importance was the need tot (a)
change the rubber cess formula and the cess allocation to stabilize ORRAF's
financial position} (b) improve ORRAP's organization and management structurel
(c) strengthen the repla! -ing program for the more needy smallholdersa and (d)
strer.othen technology transfer jointly with the Rubber Research Institute of
Thailand (RRIT) and the Department of Agricultural Extension (DOAN), with a
clearer demarcation of their responsibilities and contribution to the replanting
program. In this context, ORRAF's period of replanting assistance was to be
extended from 5-1/2 to 7- 1/2 years.
3.2       Comgonents.  The main project components comprised:
(a)  a four-year time slice of ORRaF's agricultural development
program, including new rubber replanting of about 50,000 ha per
year and bringing past replantings to maturity (about 290,000
ha);
(b) ORRAP's related field administration management and training
costs;
(c)  upgrading of RRIT research centers'/;
(d)  DOLE group processing and marketing centers and replanter
training/; and
(e)  technical assistance to improve:
(i)  ORRAP's organization and management structure; and
I]   Financed   separately   under   the   National   Agricultural   Research
Project (LN.1992-TH).
2/   Financed separately under the Second National Agricultural Extension
Project (LN.1752-TH).

(Li) RRIT's adaptive research, base line surveys and linkage
between research and extension.
ProOect pesign and organization
4.1       Project design was simple, based on the sound foundation established
by the two previous projects. Bank missions visited Thailand in October 1983 and
January 1984 to identify and prepare the project. FAO/CP participated in the
October mission and CDC in theoJanuary mission. Theee missions also e;;amined the
possibility of expanding the project scope to include development of other tree
crops, but the Government chose not to do so because it wished to focus on
smallholders, who did not traditionally cultivate other tree crops such as oil
palm. Also, other donors were already assisting some of the other tree crops.
At appraisal components for research and extension were added, although they
were ultimately funded under two separate Bank loans.
4.2       As in the two earlier projects, institutional arrangements were sound.
Specific lines of responsibility with clear delineation of functions were
established, and adequate staff was provided to implement them. The three main
implementing agencies were the Rubber Research Institute of Thailand (RRIT),
responsible for research and production of foundation stock of quality rubber
clones; the Department of Agricultural Extension (DOAE), responsible for
extension after the trees come into production; and ORRAP, responuiiole for the
supply of inputs, administration of the rubber replanting fund, general extension
before the trees come into production, and overall coordination of the project.
4.3       Experience from the earlier projects showed that it was necessary to
modify ORRAF's organization and management structure, especially to:
(a) improve the cost effectiveness of its operations;
(b) improve rubber growing technology for different growing zones;
(c) increase the period of ORRAF assistance from 5-1/2 years to 7-1/2
years to reduce the incidence of premature tapping; and
(d) revise the replanting program to reach a larger number of needy rubber
farmers.
5.   ProJect _mylementation
5.1       Proiect Cost and Financina. The total project cost (US$309.2 million)
was about 20% higher than the SAR estimate (US$258.6 million), due mainly to
higher costs for chen  als, labor and vehicles and equipment.  The Bank loan of
US$60.0 million was signed June 30, 1986 and became effective October 22, 1986.
CDC co-financed the project with a loan of £10.0 million, estimated at appraisal
at US$14.5 million but ultimately realizing US$18.38 million due to appreciation
of the Pound Sterling. At the Borrower's request, UNDP provided g;ant assistance
of US$168,300 to finance technical assistance and training, wlhich originally
would have been provided through the Bank loan.



-4-
5.2       Replanting Target.  Project implementation proceeded satisfactorily.
The loan was fully disbursed by July 1990, with ORRAF drawing on the Bank loan
at a relatively quicker pace than originally anticipated because of the higher
project costs. However, the September 30, 1991 Closing Date was retained to
allow completion of the project replanting target. The total area replanted over
the five-year period (FY1987-FY1991) was 194,164 ha or 97% of the original
appraisal target rf 200,000 ha in four years. The annual replanting target of
50,000 ha per yea could not be fully achieved, mainly because the grant of use
right certificates (Sor Tor Kor) to farm about 10,000 ha per annum in gazetted
forest areas did not materialize. The average annual rate of replanting during
the five year loan period was therefore about 39,000 ha (actually 38,833), just
about equal to the 17 year average of 39,029 ha since 19'5. Recent industry
trends, arising from such diverse factors as higher tapping efficiency, shortage
of labor and high land prices, indicate that the replanting cycle is now closer
to 30 years than to the 25 years assumed at appraisal. As a consequence, the
Government has reduced the replanting target to an average of about 36,000 ha per
annum for the period from FY1992 to FY1996.
5.3       Plantina Materiale. As in the earlier project, ORRAP las successfully
trained farmers to produce their own planting materials, which allowed the agency
to reduce its supply from 14% to 8% of total requirements over the 1987-91
period. Supplies from private nurseries fell from 23% to 16%, while farmers' own
supplies increased from 63% to 76% in line with project objectives.
5.4       RRIM 600 continues to be the favorite clone among replanters, because
it is one of the highest yielders available. However, it is not so easy to
manage as other clones and is susceptible to Phytophtora in some areas. RRIT has
advised farmers in risk areas to crown-bud with the hardier but lower yielding
CT 1. A survey of ORRAP and non-ORRAF nurseries indicated that 61% of farmers
preferred RRIM 600, 15% PR255, 5% PB5/51, 3% GT 1 and the remainder miscellaneous
clones. However, analysis of actual distribution of budded stumps from ORRAF and
non-ORRAF sources indicates that 92% was RRIM 600 and 4% GT 1, suggesting that
ORRAF's clone promotion policy does not respond adequately to the expressed
preferences of farmers for greater clone diversification.
5.5       Since the concentration of RRIN 600 poses considerable risks, research
is ongoing to find other high performance clones acceptable to farmers. Trials
at the International Exchange Clone Trials show that BPM 24 is the most promising
new clone. It is the most prolific ytelder in RRIT clone trials, is resistant
to Phytophtora and tappable in 5-1/2 years a'fter budding. BPM 24 was elevated
to the list of Class 1 clones in 1991, and ORRAF and private nurseries in the
South of Thailand have begun to propagate it extensively.
5.6       Farmer Trainina.  Farmer training responsibilities were split among
ORRAP, DOAE and RRIT. Under the project, they successfully t;-ansmitted improved
technologies to farmers through local and residential training programs,
leaflets, posters, journals, radio, television and mobile units. Over 110,000
replanters participated in courses organized by ORRAF over the project period.
ORRAP also distributed one million r-opies of journals, 70,000 technical leaflets,
and 12,500 annual reports.   About 288,000 posters were placed on walls of
groceries, coffee shops and stockists houses in the target area. Nineteen radio



- 5 -
stations in 17 provinces broadcasted 30-minute programs about rubber technology
fortnightly. Three TV stations participated regularly, broadcasting 87 programs
on rubber cultivation, cultural practices and related topics. In support of this
effort, video tape recorders and TV monitors were placed at 37 sub-provincial
offices for the benefit of farmers. Mobile units were also used to train farmers
in tapping and budding techniques. By the end of FY1991, DOAR trained 142,638
farmers who had completed the replanting program and established 100 group
processing and marketing centers (GPMC) and 550 new processing and marketing
groups. High level tapping as a means of extending the produ ive life of trees
was demonstrated on 2,100 plots, and the use of yield stimulant in the normal
tapping regime on 399 plots. RRIT conducted research in several areas (clone
development, soil science, cultural practices and tapping techniques) and
endeavored to find economic alternatives to the herbicide paraquat about which
there are questions of environmental health and safety. RRIT also trained about
69,108 farmers in the tapping courses up to FY1991.
5.7       Improving ORRAF Efficiency.  ORRAF continued to implement the cost
effectiveness measures initiated under the Second Rubber Replanting Project.
ORRAF reduced its supply of planting materials from 14% to 8% of total
requirements between 1987 and 1991, suspended fertilizer transport subsidies to
farmers from August 28, 1986, and became more responsive to price considerations
in the choice of herbicides.   New fertilizer recommendations with a higher
concentration of nutrzents to reduce transportation and storage costs were
adopted from 1989.
5.8        The Bank had recommended that ORRAF reduce the number of nurseries
producing planting materials, especially those experiencing large losses or
located in areas where private nurseries were readily available. A Consultant
from the Faculty of Agriculture, Kasetsart University conducted a study of the
operations and management of ORRAF and non-ORRAF rubber nurseries, and concluded
that five ORRAF nurseries should be retained without reservation, five could be
retained but with some reservations, and four nurseries should be phased out.
The consultant's report was useful in helping ORRAF to focus attention on its
nursery program and to evaluate its operations more critically, although a
subsequent Bank review mission found that ORRAF's nursery strategy was dynamic
and responsive to changing conditions and that not all of the report
recommendations were still valid.
5.9       Imnrovina ORRAF Organization and Manaaement.  The Bank loan included
US$400,000 for studies to improve ORRAF's computerization program, its
organizational and management structure and training. However, the Government
later requested that grant UNDP funds be used instead, and the Bank concurred.
UNDP provided a total of US$168,300 to cover the studies and to implement the
training program.
5.10      The computer study was completed in 1989 and the Government used its
own resources to procure the necessary equipment. ORRAF has installed computer
systems at Headquarters and at each provincial office, except in the northeast.
Of 16 applications, seven have already been developed. It is expected that all
systems will become fully operational by December 31, 1992.



-6-
5.11      With the introduction of computerization and the extension of its
replanting responsibilities from 5-1/2 to 7-1/2 years, ORRAF embarked on
decentralization of many of its operations from Headquarters to the provinces.
Six additional provincial offices (one in the Northeast and five in the South)
and ten more sub-provincial offices were established to offer better services to
rubber replanters.  At the same time, the four Headquarters divisions were
expanded to seven, an Office of Replanting Inspector was established, and ORRAP's
planning and monitoring capabilities were strengthened.   The UNDP-financed
management study examined the impact of decentralization and made recommendations
in March 1991 for fine tuning and further strengthening. These are being studied
by a number of committees established in ORRAF.
5.12      Some of the training recommended by the consultant has already been
completed, and ORRAF has requested UNDP to extend the completion date for the
short-term training program to May 31, 1992. Only two long-term fellowships,
financed by ORRAF, are to be provided (one for an MA in Economics and another in
Agricultural Economics for the Planning and Monitoring Division)
5.13      Needy Rubber Smallholderg. As planned at appraisal, OR?AF increased
its efforts to better serve needy rubber smallholders. The National Rubber
Policy Committee (NRPC) established a task force to study this issue in March
1986. The task force defined needy smallholders as those with total rubber area
of less than 1.6 ha and annual income of less than Baht 24,000.  The first
priority areas were Nakorn Sri Thammarat (Pun-Pin and Rhon Phibun districts) and
Pattani (Yaring and Panare districts).
5.14      Replanting application forms were modified and staff performance
targets and incentives revised to emphasize needy farmers. DOAE has promoted
estiblishment of group processing and marketing centers to facilitate marketing,
and demonstrations of high level tapping systems have been held to promote higher
productivity of rubber trees to increase smallholder incomes. It was expected
that the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOAC) would reorient its
supplementary assistance fund to provide immediate cash payment to poorer
farmers, but this did not materialize. However, ORRAF has been sponsoring a
pilot marketing project aimed at eliminating intermediaries and providing for
direct contact between factory and farmers and for immediate payment to
smallholders.
5.15      The grant of use rignt certificates (Sor Tor Kor) to facilitate rubber
replanting in gazetted forests did not materialize. However, the ORRAF Act was
amended to include new planting on areas of between 2 rai (0.32 ha) and 15 rai
(2.4 ha) for farmers who had not previously had a rubber holding. As a result,
the New Planting Project was launched by ORRAF in September 1989, with total new
planting at over 7,000 ha by September 1991, 28% of the 5-year target for FY1989-
93. About 80% of new planting is planned for the Northeast where the neediest
farmers are concentrated.
5.16      Rubber Replantino Fund. one of the main conditionalities in the Loan
Agreement required that Government:   (a) take steps to ensure the self-
sufficiency of the Rubber Replanting Fund by amending the ORRAP Act so that the
cess would be set at a flat rate per kilogram, instead of being allowed to



-7-
fluctuate with world rubber prices; and (b) increase the allocation of cess
revenues for ORRAF administrative costs to at least 10%. In compliance with this
covenant, the ORRAF Act was duly amended on August 2S, 1987 (&s published in the
RTG Gazette Vol. 104 Part 269, Special Issue dated December 20, 1987) to provide
for a flat rate calculation of the cess. The revised ORRAF Act allocates cess
revenues as follows:
(i)  research and experimentation (the Research Fund) - not more than
St
(ii)  ORRAE   administrative costs (the Administration Fund) - not more
than 10%; and
(iii)  direct replanting costs (the Replanting Fund) - at least 85%.
The Act provides that any deficit in the Administration Fund would be met from
additional appropriations in the annual budget.
S.17      A flat cess rate of Baht 1.70/kg, which would have assured the self-
sufficiency of the Fund, was introduced in June 1988. The years 1987, 1988 and
early 1989 were favored by relatively high rubber prices, but in the latter part
of 1989 prices dropped significantly. In December 1989 farmers protested the low
rubber prices and the Government responded by suspending both the export tax on
rubber and the cess. Suspension of the cess remained in effect from December
1989 to July 1990, when it was re-introduced at a rate of Baht 0.60/kg from July
21, 1990 to May 31, 1991 and then at Baht 0.90/kg since June 1, 1991. The export
tax has not been re-imposed. The self-sufficiency of the Rubber Replanting Fund
has been jeopardized by cesS suspension and its restoration at the reduced rates.
Projections based on a revised replanting rate of 37,000 ha per annum, with cess
collection at Baht 0.90/kg, show that the Replanting Fund would deteriorate from
a balance of Baht 2,658 million (US$106 M) in FY1989 to Baht 429 million (US$17
M) by FY1994, with the deficit rising by about Baht 900 million (US$36 M) per
year. To sustain the program, the Government has made provision to cover this
deficit from general revenues, but this is not a viable long-term solution.
Government must monitor the situation carefully and raise the cess progressively
as rubber prices improve, eventually restoring the cess to a level to make the
Rubber Replanting Fund self-sufficient. Full cost recovery of replanting costs
must be the goal of the replanting program.
5.18      Despite the possibility that it may be necessary for Government to
cover periodic shortfalls in the Rubber Replanting Fund, the success of. the
replanting program in Thailand, as in Sri Lanka and Malaysia, has demonstrated
that the cess arrangement for supporting rubber replanting by smallholders works
far better than rural credit schemes elsewhere.
6.        Proiect Results
6.1       The total area replanted under the project was 194,164 ha, 97% of the
appraisal target. The average annual yield of tapping, estimated at 1,484 kg/ha
at appraisal, has been revised by RRIT to 1,687 kg/ha based on the results of its
surveys. Total incremental production is expected to be about 5.9 million tons,



compared with the appraisal estimate of 4.1 million tons. Foreign exchange
earnings (in 1990 constant dollars) at full development are expected to be about
US$300 million per year (26% of total rubber export earnings), compared with the
appraisal estimate of US$228 million. Incremental production over the life of
the project is expected to total about US$4.2 billion, compared with appraisal
estimate of US$3.8 billion.
6.2       The re-estimated Economic Rate of Return (ERR) is about 16%, compared
with an appraisal estimate of 18%. The lower ERR is due to a lower projected
price for rubber, which is partly offset by revenues from the sale of old rubber
trees on about 22% of the replanted area.
6.3       The income distribution and poverty alleviation goals of the project
are being achieved, although at more modest rates than expected at appraisal.
In total, 118,258 plots were replanted under the project, compared with an
appraisal estimate of 167,000.  The average plot size is 1.6 ha, compared with
the appraisal estimate of 1.2 ha. Nonetheless, the average of 1.6 ha is less
than the average plot size of 1.8 ha under the previous project, which indicates
that smaller farmers are benefitting more from this project. Per capita income
at full development is expected to be about the same as the appraisal estimate
of Baht 14,000, compared with per capita income from agriculture of Baht 8,000
and rural poverty level of Baht 4,700.
6.4       The project enhanced human resource development.   ORRAF trained
110,000 farmers in management operations, nurseries, planting and field
maintenance. Over 240,000 farmers participated in courses covering bud-grafting,
tapping and related subjects organized by RRIT and DOAe. An a consequence of the
training provided by ORRAF, DOAE and RRIT, the bulk of the planting material
utilized under the project was produced by farmers themselves.
6.5       The environmental impact of the project was minimal.  The project
replaced old rubber trees with new higher-producing clones. Less than 10% of the
area needed terracing to prevent run-off and seol erosion, and the scattered
nature of the plantings limited the impact of such run-off.  Where the land was
sloping, contour lines were established before planting took place. Also a mixed
cover crop consisting of CalopogoniM and Centrosema species was planted between
the contour lines to prevent erosion. Only small amounts of agro-chemicals were
used, with no known adverse environmental effects. During implementation, the
stump-killed 2.45-T was replaced by Triclopyr to reduce possible toxicity. Many
farmers are also replacing the relatively toxic paraquat with round-up, which is
particularly effective on grass weeds. RRIT is currently researching other
economic substitutes for paraquat for use on broad leaf weeds.
7.        Proiect Sustainabilitv
7.1       There is little doubt that the project is technically sustainable.
The trees have been properly established, the farmers have been well trained, and
the level of field husbandry is high.   Premature tapping could reduce the
productive life of trees, but under the project ORRAF support to replanters has
been extended from 5-1/2 years to 7-1/2 years to prevent this. Tapping skills



-9-
have also improved in response to training programs instituted by implementing
agencies.
7.2       The main project risk relates to the low international rubber prices.
As a consequence of low rubber prices during the late 1980's, the cess was
reduced to a level which would not ensure the liquidity of the Fund beyond FY1994
without Government assistance, unless international prices improve. Also, about
80% of replanters use share-tappers to harvest rubber, and low rubber prices
could eventually depress wages to the point that it would be difficult to attract
labor in a rapidly developing economy in which overall agricultural wages are
rising (as in Malaysia). However, the Bank forecasts the price of natural rubber
to rise steadily from US$1,020/NT in 1990 to US$2,064/MT in 1994 (in 1990
constant dollars).   The price is then forecast to rise by almost 18% to
US$1,254/MT between 1994 and 1995, going to US$1,297/MT in 2000 and falling to
US$1,268/MT by the year 2005. If these prices materialize, Government will be
able to both increase the cess rate and restore the self-sufficiency of the
Replanting Fund. The key to the sustainability of the industry will be farmers,
ability to reduce costs and improve productivity. The implementing agencies are
well aware of this and they have been trying to raise the productivity and cost-
consciousness of the farmers accordingly.
S.        Bank Performance
8.1       Through the project, the Bank financed a third time-slice of ORRAP's
accelerated replanting program and helped to address the agency's main
institutional development needs. The transfer of improved rubber technology from
Malaysia had already been initiated and two earlier projects had already been
successfully implemented, so there were no major problems in implementation. The
Bank was successful in getting RTG to:  (a) extend ORRAP jurisdiction over
replanters from 5-1/2 years to 7-1/2 years to reduce the incidence of premature
tapping; (b) improve ORRAP's organization and management; and (c) strengthen
technology transfer jointly with RRIT and DOAE. The Bank also succeeded in
getting the Government to change the rubber cess formula to a flat rate and,
initially, to set a rate that would assure the self-sufficiency of the replanting
fund. Nine supervision missions served to maintain a good dialogue with project
staff and farmers and to ensure smooth project implementation.
9.        Borrower Performance
9.1       The performance of the implementing agencies (ORRAF, DOAB and RRIT)
was good throughout the project cycle.   Project management was effective,
institutional arrangements were sound, planning and organization of input supply
was good, and implementing agencies maintained excellent rapport with rubber
replanters.
9.2       The Borrower complied with all legal agreements.  However, although
Government changed the rubber cess formula to a flat rate and initially set it
at a level adequate to ensure the self-sufficiency of the Replanting Fund, the
cess was temporarily suspended and the rate was subsequently reduced as a result
of low rubber prices in the late 19809. The Government also did not grant use



- 10 -
right certificates (Sor Tor Xor), which would have allowed farmers to replant
rubber in gazetted forests.
10.       Proiect Relatlanghigjt
10.1      The relationships among the core Government agencies, the implementing
agencies, the Bank, CDC and UNDP have been good throughout the pre-project and
project periods.
10.2      CDC participated in the preparation of the project and in early
supervision missions. CDC also acceded to Government's request to reallocate
Baht 69 million from its loan to support a New Planting Project in the Northeast.
10.3      UNDP was not one of the original co-financiers of this project but it
readily agreed to finance the technical assistance component of the project when
requested to do so by the Government, and this was a very positive contribution.
11.       Consultina Services
11.1      Local consultants were engaged to assist ORPA? in evaluating its
nursery operations and in improving staff productivity through computerization
and reorganization of its organization and management structure. The performance
of these consultants was satisfactory.
11.2      Delays were encountered in finalizing arrangements for UNDP financing
for the management study and in deciding on whether the executing agency should
be the Department of Technical and Economic Cooperation (DTEC) or PAO. However,
once the decision was taken that DTEC would be the executing agency, the
consultants completed the work satisfactorily and submitted their reports on
time.
12.       Proiect Documentation and Data
12.1      The appraisal report provided a useful framework for both the Bank and
the Borrower to monitor project implementation. ORRA maintained satisfactory
accounting records and submitted project reports regularly.   ORRM  readily
provided the basic data for preparation of this report. The legal agreements
were also satisfactory, and the Borrower complied with all of the conditions
therein.
13.       Findings and Lessons Learned
13.1      The following lessons learned in the course of implementing this
project may be relevant to similar tree crop projects in Thailand and elsewhere.
(a)  an effective organization shoulds   (i) be responsible for both
dissemination of technical information and coordination of the supply
of improved planting materials and other inputs; and (ii) be
financially stable;



- 11 -
(b) there should be a clear delineation of functions among project
executing agencies;
(a) good arrangements for timely collection and marketing of output are
essential;
(d) farmers must have appropriate incentives to replant and to adopt
improved technologies; and there must be adequate measures to meet
their subsistence needs during the immature stage of the rubber trees;
and
(e) the approach to financing long-term smallholder tree crop replanting
in Thailand (as in Malaysia and Sri Lanka) has proven far more
effective than have rural credit schemes for this purpose elsewhere.
Of course, the rates must be set at a level adequate to ensure the
long-term financial sustainability of the replanting fund, even if
occasional Government subventions are necessary on poverty alleviation
grounds during years of extremely low world market prices.

PART It: Proiect Review from Borrgers Peruipective
On February 19, 1992, the Bank sent the draft PCR to the Borrower with a
request to prepare Part II. The Borrower responded that its comments had been
incorporated in the preliminary report; therefore, there was no need to prepare
a separate Part U1.
