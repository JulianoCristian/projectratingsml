structural adjustment program, covering the period 1991-93.\n            The program's basic objectives are to create the\n            conditions for a sustainable recovery of economic activity,\n            leading to a growth rate of close to four percent by 1993,\n            and to improve the provision of basic social services while\n            protecting vulnerable groups. Specifically, the program aims\n            at: (a) a significant improvement in the government's\n            financial position by re-establishing an equilibrium, and\n            eventually surpluses, in the primary current balance; (b)\n            the administrative restructuring of key ministries and a\n            revised program of civil service departures; (c) pursuit of\n            the financial system restructuring and establishing an\n            appropriate judicial and supervisory framework for sound\n            financial intermediation; (d) rationalization of the public\n            enterprise sector through further divestitures and\n            improvements in the financial performance of enterprises\n            remaining in the government portfolio; (e) further\n            improvements in the trade regime and in the incentive\n            structure for private investments; (f) laying the basis for\n            a far-reaching reform of the educational system; and (g)\n            implementing a rehabilitation program for critical\n            administrative and social infrastructure and short-term\n            measures to protect vulnerable groups."}, "docdt": "1991-06-03T00:00:00Z"}
