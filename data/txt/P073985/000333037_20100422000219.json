Facility\n            (GEF) Project for Chile were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to Global Environment\n            Outcome (GEO) was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: there is a need\n            to be realistic when defining the GEO and to ensure good\n            monitoring and evaluation. The GEO should be closely linked\n            to the project activities, and indicators should be designed\n            so as to ensure that they serve as good monitoring tools for\n            the project activities, i.e. indicators with a solid link to\n            both the project activities and the GEO, that set clear\n            quantitative target values and that are measurable. The\n            project team and Bank management should have taken advantage\n            of the assessment carried out during the mid-term review and\n            project restructuring should have taken place, independently\n            of the workload this implies, especially for GEF projects. A\n            project supporting a broad government program, such as the\n            Santiago Urban Transport Plan (PTUS), is more difficult to\n            implement and hence more risky. Therefore, the Bank should\n            be more selective in terms of the areas to be supported,\n            limiting support to a small number of areas or activities,\n            possibly inter-related and reinforcing each another. The\n            success of the bicycle component was mainly the result of\n            the high buy-in of different levels of government and the\n            existence of a very active civil society, from which the\n            project was able to capitalize with properly timed\n            interventions and close supervision. The latter allowed for\n            the redesign of some project activities according to real needs."}, "docdt": "2010-03-24T00:00:00Z"}
