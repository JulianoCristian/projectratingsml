F. Results Framework Analysis
Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators(as approved)
1.1. To help reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) from ground transport in Santiago through
the promotion of a long-term modal shift to more efficient and less polluting forms of
transport, and the adoption of sustainable low-GHG transport measures. To that end, the
project will support the implementation of the 2000-2010 Urban Transport Plan for
Santiago (TRANSANTIAGO, formerly known as PTUS), a comprehensive multi-sector
plan, which is consistent with the overall objectives of the GEF operational program on
sustainable transport.

  The plan specific objectives are to (i) maintain share of public transport (60% of total
trips); (ii) promote rational management of transport demand, internalizing all costs from
car travel; (iii) promote land-use policies that take into account environmental and
transport dimensions helping reduce the average trip length; (iv) promote better
coordination between agencies dealing with transport related policies and issues; and (v)
reduce emissions of air pollutants from public transport (70% of PM10 and 45% of NOx
emissions from 1997 levels).

  1.2. To help improve air quality of Santiago, through reducing emissions of air
pollutants like SOx, CO, PM, and NOx (which together with VOCs contribute to the
formation of smog or tropospheric ozone (O3)).

1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
Country and sector background
1.   Although Santiago's transport system at appraisal in 2003 was less chaotic than
     systems in other large Latin American cities, air pollution was acute and the transport
     sector suffered from a number of serious problems, which needed to be addressed.
     These included the following:
·    High air pollution levels, with transport as the major contributor to local emissions;
·    Exponential increase in car ownership and use putting pressure on the urban transport
     system through growing traffic and congestion (in the period between 1977 and 2001,
     car ownership in Santiago increased from 320 cars to 560 cars per 1000 households,
     the number of person trips went up by 69%, the share of motorized car trips increased
     from 12.3% to 38.09%, and the average length of these trips went up as well);
·    Relative deficiencies in the organization of the bus system (for instance, bus operators
     competed for passengers in the streets, which generated operating inefficiencies and
     dangerous driving; fragmented bus ownership and few sizable companies, poorly
     coordinated and chaotic transport supply that did not adapt to demand levels,
     oversupply during off-peak hours contributing to unnecessary congestion, pollution
     and increased operating costs; long bus routes crossing the city center and the most
     heavily used corridors; lack of fare integration between buses and the metro
     increasing travel costs and reducing accessibility, especially for the poor); and
·    Limited inter-agency coordination at metropolitan level (incipient coordination
     among the agencies dealing with transport and air pollution mainly due to the
     diversity of sectors and actors and the absence of a transport coordinating body at the
     metropolitan level).
2.  At appraisal, environment and transport planning agencies had already initiated pro-
active coordination around common goals and objectives through the 2000-2010 Santiago
Urban Transport Plan (PTUS), at that time also known as TRANSANTIAGO. This Plan
was designed as a means to reverse the previously mentioned trends and improve the
urban environment. It consisted of a comprehensive and innovative multi-sector exercise
that placed special attention on incorporating local and global environmental dimensions.
The Plan was comprised of 12 programs,1 of which public transport modernization was

1
  The PTUS included the following programs[0]: (1) Public Transport Modernization focusing, among others, on (i)
replacing the previous approach to bus service contracting, from one with several thousand mostly informal owner-
operators to one based on gross-cost contracting of 14 relatively large operators, each with 200 to 500 vehicles; (ii)
providing incentives to operators to acquire high-standard low-polluting buses; (iii) redesigning the route network into
a trunk and feeder system and reducing the number of buses; (iv) introducing a unified fare system; (v) separating fare
collection as a competitively awarded concession and commissioning a public transport management/information
center to control bus flows; (vi) limiting the number of taxis, and (vii) implementing a comprehensive infrastructure
program to double the extension of the subway system and construct segregated busways, bus stops, interchange
stations, terminals, and underpasses); (2) Road Investments and Traffic Control, which included constructing urban toll
roads on the basis of public-private partnerships, allocating and managing road space to maximize social gains through
traffic management schemes that give priority to public transport, pricing schemes and parking restrictions; (3)Location
of Educational Institutions, including mainly the efficient management of school trips; (4) Promotion of New
Commercial and Service Centers to reduce the length of certain trips; (5) Change in Residential Land-Use Trends


                                                           1
by far the most important and complex one because its design was expected to result in
profound changes in the way residents moved within Santiago. For this reason, nowadays
TRANSANTIAGO commonly only refers to the public transport modernization program
and not to the PTUS as a whole.
3. In this ICR, we will use the term PTUS when referring to the overall Santiago Urban
Transport Plan and the term TRANSANTIAGO to refer to the public transport
modernization program although in the PAD and other project documents these terms
were used indistinctly.
Rationale for Bank assistance
4.  The Bank's support to the implementation of the PTUS, and in particular its public
transport program, was expected to help address the main issues affecting transport and
mobility in Santiago. In turn, this would reduce air pollution; by far the most serious
environmental problem faced in the metropolitan area. It was also expected that
improvements in transport and mobility would have an important effect in terms of
climate change mitigation.
5. This support came in a package of three instruments: this GEF grant (P073985), the
Santiago Urban Transport Programmatic Development Loan (DPL - P082412) and the
Santiago Urban Transport Technical Assistance Loan (TAL - P086689).
6.  The GEF grant strove to accelerate the introduction of the PTUS by concentrating on
four project components, each one contributing to abate Green House Gas (GHG)
emissions with different degrees of intensity and different implementation periods. The
approach taken by the project was to support a multi-sector approach to improve mobility
and quality of life, as opposed to focusing only on transport-specific measures. The Bank
was expected to provide professional advice, facilitate coordination among actors, and
ensure adequate program monitoring.
7.  The DPL supported the public transport reform, including the institutional,
organizational and managerial transformation of the system to ensure its continuity and
sustainability. It also emphasized on fostering more integrated coordination among
transport, land-use and environmental issues, including social and participatory elements,
and supporting the difficult process of reallocating scarce street space to the exclusive use
of non-motorized transport (NMT) and public transport. The TAL was meant to provide
the necessary technical assistance and advice to support this difficult process of
transformation.
8. This GEF project was consistent with the goals and strategic approach set out in the
2002 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). Indeed, while supporting the PTUS it was
expected to (a) enhance sustained economic growth and social progress; (b) foster the


through, among others, mixed land-use and densification; (6) NMT, by improving conditions for cyclists and
pedestrians; (7) Immediate Action Program to reduce the number of environmental alerts in Santiago; (8) Regulation of
Urban Freight Transport to rationalize freight-related traffic and reduce its environmental footprint; (9) Monitoring and
Control; (10) Financing; (11) Communication and Citizens' Participation; and (12) Other Programs, including
institutional aspects, such as setting up coordinated transport and infrastructure planning mechanisms at the
metropolitan level, and environmental issues, especially the first update of Environmental Prevention and Clean-Up
Plan (PPDA) [0][0]launched by the National Commission for the Environment (CONAMA) in 2003 to reduce air and
noise pollution from mobile and fixed emission sources.


                                                           2
inclusion of the most vulnerable groups through improved access at affordable prices and
reasonable travel times, hence contributing to socially inclusive growth; (c) improve
environmental conditions; (d) promote public-private partnerships through a concession
mechanism for public transport services; and (e) modernize the State and build its
technical capacity.
9.  The project was also consistent with the GEF focal area of climate change, in
particular with the overall objective and scope of the 2001 GEF operational program 11
on promoting environmentally sustainable transport.


1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators
10.The GEF project GEO, which are the equivalent of the Project Development
Objectives (PDO), were:
· To help reduce GHG from ground transport in Santiago through the promotion of a
   long-term modal shift to more efficient and less polluting forms of transport, and the
   adoption of sustainable low-GHG transport measures. To that end, the project
   supported the implementation of the PTUS and its specific objectives2; and
· To help improve air quality of Santiago through reduced emissions of air pollutants
   like SOx, CO, PM, and NOx (which together with VOCs contribute to the formation
   of smog or tropospheric ozone (O3)).
11. This definition of the GEO needs to be seen in the context of the overall Bank support
to the PTUS described in paragraphs 4 to 7. The existence of a battery of instruments to
address the transport and mobility problems in Santiago explains the ambitious GEO in
the light of the concrete project activities as well as their link to the implementation of the
PTUS and the achievement of its specific objectives.
12. Similarly, based on this idea of a Bank support package to the PTUS, the GEF project
had two types of indicators: (a) long-term performance indicators related to the
implementation of the PTUS and (b) project performance indicators to measure the
achievement of the GEO. The former, which were closely related to the implementation
of the PTUS and so largely outside the control of the project activities, included:
· Urban Transport Plan for Santiago implemented;
· Share of public transport maintained;
· Land-use policies in place to favor the reduction of average trip length;
· Technological regulatory incentives to introduce clean technologies for transport
    introduced/barriers removed;
· NMT share of total trips increased;
· Growth in cars-km reduced;
· Air quality indicators improved in spite of economic and demographic growth;
· Reduced carbon intensity per travelled km; and

2
  The specific objectives of the PTUS were to (i) maintain the modal share of public transport; (ii) promote rational
management of transport demand, internalizing all costs from car travel; (iii) promote land-use policies that take into
account environmental and transport dimensions helping reduce the average trip length; (iv) promote better
coordination between agencies dealing with transport related policies and issues; and (v) reduce emissions of air
pollutants from public transport.

·     Evidence of behavioral change towards more rational transport demand.
  The project performance indicators included:
13.
Component 1:
· Increased bicycle use as transport mode, in particular within/between the
  municipalities (Comunas) of Santiago, Providencia, and Ñuñoa; and
· Reduced number of bicycle accidents per 1,000 bicycle trips in those Comunas.
Component 2:
· Upgrading of local emissions testing laboratory (3CV) so that it could perform up-to-
  date emission testing for heavy-duty vehicles;

1.3 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
14.   The GEO and key indicators were not revised.




                                            4
1.4 Main Beneficiaries
15. The primary target group included Santiago's residents and people living in the
metropolitan region making daily trips to and within the city, and all inhabitants affected
by air pollution. Additionally, since the project aimed at helping to put in place policies,
institutions, and infrastructure to sustain measures to reduce GHG emissions, it was also
expected to have a global impact.


1.5 Original Components (as approved)
16.   The four project components were the following:
17.   1. Promotion of bicycle use
The project included (a) 21.94 km of GEF-funded bikeways connecting the Comunas of
Santiago, Providencia, and Ñuñoa; (b) 21.2 km of bikeways about to be built in the same
Comunas with government funding and 11.6 km then recently built or under
construction; (c) the implementation of a promotional strategy aiming at changing travel
behavior to achieve a sustainable modal shift to bicycles; (d) a safety strategy to
minimize bicycle accidents and maximize personal security; and (e) a process to monitor
and evaluate the results of the pilot program.
18.   2. Modernizing the bus system
This component aimed at supporting the development of Santiago's new bus system,
which was not only expected to provide a more efficient use of buses (reducing bus fleet,
higher bus occupancy, and higher average speed), but also an opportunity to renew the
bus fleet both at the city and national levels. The component had three sub-components:
2.1 Technical assistance for evaluating the economic and environmental impact of
clean bus technologies
This subcomponent was expected to provide technical assistance to compare the technical
and environmental performance and the associated costs of hybrid-electric buses with
CNG and diesel ones. It was also expected to provide information to establish more
stringent emission standards to be used in the bus operation concessioning process for the
restructured public transport system.
2.2 Implementation of the framework for bus reform
The technical assistance under this sub-component was expected to support a review of
management and business organization measures required to effectively operate the new
corridor infrastructure, including a system of business organization, the concessions for
specific bus line operations, and the structuring of integrated fares. It was also expected
to fund the design of a program to retrain bus drivers and insert them into other sectors.
Moreover, this sub-component was expected to support the establishment of a framework
to monitor the environmental, social and operational effects of the new system.
2.3 Renewal of the bus fleet
This sub-component was expected to finance a strategic study to define ways of
synchronizing and coordinating the removal of "not-so-old" buses from Santiago's
streets.


                                             5
19.   3. Strategic Environmental Assessment
The project was expected to fund advisory work to ensure the coordination of sector
policies, programs, and projects dealing with transport, urban development, land-use and
the environment. To that end, it aimed at developing tools for an upstream integration of
environmental management within the scope of the development of urban transport plans
and policies, including land-use pattern changes, pricing, and tariff schemes and to
consider options to ensure adequate institutional coordination.
20. 4. Technical Assistance and Analytical Support: land-use patterns and
internalization of costs
This component consisted of a series of studies and technical assistance.
4.1 Assessment of land-use incentives and policies to reduce motorized travel
4.1.1 Developing the Central Ring of Santiago (Anillo Central)
This subcomponent aimed at developing a methodology to calculate the environmental
impacts of urban development policies to spur the development of housing projects
located on the Anillo Central as well as helping decision-makers to better evaluate the
development of available central sites according to the expected impact on transport, air
pollution and global warming.
4.1.2 School location
This subcomponent aimed at assessing the economic and environmental impact of new
school facilities locations to reduce the average school trip length, especially in the light
of the introduction of the full time school day (Jornada Escolar Completa or JEC).
4.1.3 Housing Policy
The project was expected to provide technical assistance to authorities in charge of
housing policies and regulations to better integrate the transport and environment
dimensions into policy making.
4.2 Reducing Motorized Traffic
4.2.1 Traffic Calming at City Center
This subcomponent consisted of studies to identify sound traffic calming measures to
reduce car traffic in Santiago's historic center, including a diagnostic phase, a design
phase, stakeholder consultation, and integration of GHG emission reductions into
regulatory measures and the preliminary engineering designs for the civil works.
4.2.2 Congestion pricing
This sub-component aimed at reducing and rationalizing the use of private cars by means
of road or congestion pricing measures which would internalize external costs imposed
on society by car drivers. The grant was expected to fund a study to assess the social,
environmental and economic impacts of various forms of congestion pricing,
acceptability conditions and implementation mechanisms.
4.3 Travel optimization
The project was to support a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of implementing a
large scale program to make rational use of mobility options and the implementation of a
medium scale pilot phase.
4.4 Emission compensation (Decontamination Bonds) scheme
This included a study to evaluate options to promote further local investment in
sustainable transport by integrating GHG emission reductions into the new emission
compensation (Decontamination Bonds) scheme, which envisaged the possibility to


                                             6
compensate for NOx and PM emissions through the financing of sustainable transport
measures. GEF incremental support was also expected to help raise awareness on
opportunities for emission off-set investments in sustainable transport and ensure the
inclusion of additional GHG benefits in the scheme.

1.6 Revised Components
21.   The project components were not revised.


1.7 Other significant changes
22.Due to delays in project implementation mainly caused by the problems that
accompanied the introduction of TRANSANTIAGO, the original closing date of this
grant was extended by 18 months to September 30, 2009.



2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
23. The main aspect affecting project implementation and outcomes both positively and
negatively lay in the way the project scope was defined, which was based on the policy
areas of the PTUS. As such, on the one hand, the project supported activities that
represented real local priorities, many of them with considerable political support, strong
ownership, government commitment and some real champions. On the other hand,
however, since the PTUS was wide-ranging, following this approach resulted in an overly
ambitious project. This required a complex institutional arrangement with eight different
government agencies involved and the need for a great amount of coordination among
them.
24. The use of a PDF-B GEF project preparation grant contributed to the completeness
and soundness of the project background analyses and ensured its readiness. The
stakeholder involvement/participatory processes during preparation were adequate. In
particular, they included a series of stakeholder workshops to fine-tune the project design
and the consultation with a number of NGOs to define some of the Terms of Reference
(ToR) for the project. The level of technical expertise behind the preparation of each ToR
was high, and there was a sound technical reason supporting the need for undertaking the
studies financed by the project. Additionally, the workshops also provided visibility to
the project activities, especially to the bicycle component. This visibility at the outset was
considered by some of the stakeholders as an important ingredient for the success of
bicycling related activities in Santiago.
25. The great ambitions in defining of the GEO and the project outcomes made their full
achievement difficult. As already mentioned, since the Bank supported the PTUS with
three instruments, the GEO and outcomes were mainly linked to the implementation of
the PTUS as a whole, over which the GEF project activities had little influence and no
control. Indeed, most of the activities consisted in studies. Therefore, they had not a
decisive role in influencing the implementation of the PTUS nor did they directly lead to


                                              7
reduction in CO2 and other air pollutants. The exception was the promotion of NMT
component; the only component reflecting a program of the PTUS and directly leading to
emission reductions.
26. The risk assessment was rather comprehensive. However, it did not adequately take
into account the innovative nature of some of the project activities and the fact the many
of them resulted in tools and study recommendations, for which there was no guarantee
that they would be used or implemented.

2.2 Implementation
27.There were specific factors that affected both positively and negatively the
implementation of the project. Among those factors that contributed to the proper
execution of the project are:
· The availability of strong champions in the National Commission for Traffic Safety
   (CONASET), and later in the Transport Subsecretariat, and in the National
   Commission for the Environment (CONAMA) for the NMT promotion activities and
   the emissions compensation scheme, respectively. This helped to keep up with the
   commitments of these activities independently of the implementation of
   TRANSANTIAGO and the changes in CGTS. However, the commitment of some
   other project agencies diminished during project implementation because their
   participation was small and/or the activities were no longer a priority in their busy
   agendas.
· The mid-term review (MTR) was thoroughly done and helped the implementation
   agency and project team to identify critical issues in project implementation. It also
   helped to assess and adapt the Bank's supervision style to better fit the reality on the
   ground. After the MTR, more hands-on follow-up became the norm, which included
   strong implementation support and regular follow-up conference calls. In hindsight, at
   that moment the project should have been restructured to adapt the GEO / indicators
   to the real project scope and replace some of the components or subcomponents that
   had been losing their champions with other priority activities with strong GHG
   emission reduction potential.
28. The main factor that played against the implementation of the project and that
triggered the need for extending its closing date, was the launch of TRANSANTIAGO in
February 2007. The problems faced by the government because of the implementation of
the public transport system had a direct impact on the implementation of the GEF project.
For nearly a year, all human resources of CGTS, including all the staff working on the
GEF project, were devoted to dealing with the problems associated with
TRANSANTIAGO. In this crisis situation, there was practically only one professional
responsible, not even on a full time basis, for all activities under the project, except for
the financial management ones. This person, independently of his great professional
skills, was not able to keep all activities on track. The time needed to coordinate all
agencies involved, prepare ToRs and bidding documents, review reports was not enough,
especially given that this professional was also assigned emergency tasks to support the
implementation of TRANSANTIAGO.
29.   Other factors that gave rise to problems in project implementation included:


                                              8
·     The shift of priorities over time, from a broad range of topics, as shown by the
      different programs of the PTUS, to one program in particular, the public transport
      program, i.e. TRANSANTIAGO. Because of the complexity of TRANSANTIAGO
      itself, some studies supported by the project, although still relevant, were simply no
      longer a priority. This was further accentuated by the fact that the commitment and
      ownership of some of the activities were personified by individuals rather than the
      whole institutions they belonged to.
·     The changes in CGTS' leadership and staff had some normal negative impacts on the
      project implementation pace and quality because new people needed to become
      familiar with the project.
·     UNDP's involvement as procurement agent was justified at appraisal mainly to
      reduce the fiduciary related work load for CGTS and expedite contracting, compared
      to the standard procedures that required the participation of the Contraloria General
      de la Republica (government auditing body). Initially it worked relatively well, but
      later, especially with the changes in UNDP's rules and procurement procedures, it
      added an additional layer of bureaucracy. It therefore slowed down procurement
      processes without providing any real additional value because CGTS had, for most
      part of the project duration, the necessary capacity to carry out Bank procurement.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
30. The M&E framework was comprehensive. It identified sector-related and CAS goals,
GEF operational program objectives, the GEO, and outputs by component. It included the
respective indicators, provided the data collection strategy, and mentioned the critical
assumptions. At the time the project was prepared, such a level of detail and
thoroughness in M&E frameworks was not common in transport projects.
31. However, the framework had limitations as far as the direct link between the GEO
and the project activities is concerned. The indicators were adequate to measure the
outputs of the project activities (project performance indicators), but they had
shortcomings when it came to monitoring the progress toward achieving the GEO, i.e.
the long-term performance or outcome indicators. This is because, as already mentioned,
the latter were mainly linked to the implementation of the PTUS, over which the GEF
project activities had little influence and no control.
32.Most indicators did not specify precise and/or quantitative target values. A number of
them also lacked baselines or an indication on how and when these baselines would have
been defined.
33. Data to assess the achievement of the GEO were collected regularly during project
implementation, in particular during the midterm review. However, for some of the
indicators, in particular outcome indicators, the necessary data were not available (or not
available in a timely manner). Especially under the bicycle component, the monitoring
and evaluation study was used to inform decision-making and partially also to guide
resource reallocation.


2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance



                                              9
34. This was a category C project. The Environmental Assessment Policy (OP 4.01) was
triggered because of some potential negative environmental impacts from bikeway
construction, such as noise, dust, limitations to access and traffic interruptions. The
project successfully avoided and/or mitigated possible negative environmental and social
impacts. The bikeway construction took place in urban areas with considerable
development and human activity. The local environmental rules and procedures were
applied. A Bank environmental specialist participated in all supervision missions/field
visits. No activities requiring involuntary resettlements took place.
35. In fiduciary terms, financial management was satisfactory. Financial management
reports (FMR) and auditing reports were by and large submitted on time. None of the
audit reports had a qualified opinion. Procurement was also satisfactory, except for the
period from April 2008 to May 2009 covered by the last procurement ex-post review.
This corresponded to a period of adaptation in CGTS because of the change in project
coordinator, which temporarily weakened the capacity to handle Bank procurement.
Hence, procurement was only rated moderately satisfactory.


2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
36. The continuity of the bicycle related project activities and the sustainability of the use
of bikes as alternative means of transport are highly likely. The bike has taken off as
means of transport in Santiago, with annual increases in bicycle use of 23% in the winter
and 12% in the spring periods in the project area with bikeways. Among the users are
trendy young people, including numerous women. There are many bike related initiatives
going on, such a mass bike rides, street closures on Sundays, and workshops. The
promotion of NMT is embedded in the agenda of the central and municipal governments.
The Transport Subsecretariat, which actively participated in project implementation
during the last year, recently took over the responsibility for NMT in Chile.3 Its
involvement in this area considers the participation of representatives of the many
different grassroots movements that promote cycling in Chile. The Subsecretariat also
hosts a national bicycle website and will continue to make use of the training material
developed under the project. In addition, it is implementing a bike parking pilot for which
it will use the bicycle parking facilities design specification prepared under the project.
The subway operator also has a parking facility program in several stations aimed at
promoting bike inter-modality, which is also of interest to the GCTS.
37. Furthermore, the Santiago Regional Government (GORE or Intendencia
Metropolitana) launched an ambitious program aimed at the completion of 690 km of
bikeways by 2012 defined in the Plan for Santiago on Bicycle (550 km in urban areas and
the remaining 140 km in rural areas). This target/deadline is part of the Environmental
Prevention and Clean-Up Plan (PPDA)[0] update, currently in its final stage of approval,
which makes it compulsory. So far, 190 km have already been constructed. Funding is
provided by the Intendencia, the Ministry of Public Works (MOP) and the Ministry of



3
  The second update of the PPDA, currently in its final stage of approval before becoming law, envisages the
responsibility for NMT within the Study Division of the Transport Subsecretariat.


                                                    10
Housing (MINVU). The Plan also considers the availability of bike parking facilities.
Furthermore, a "bicycle law" is pending in Congress4.
38. Finally, a number of municipalities have been active in promoting NMT with or
without the support of the GORE program described above. Ñuñoa, Providencia and
some other municipalities have their own NMT/bicycle agendas. The maintenance of the
project-financed bikeways is ensured by the respective municipalities, which are
responsible based on an agreement signed at the beginning of the project.
39. The second component provided support to TRANSANTIAGO, which was
implemented. Despite the initial start-up difficulties, the system is now stabilized. User
approval ratings have increased steadily and the main differences at a political level were
resolved.5 The main project contributions consisted of co-financing the implementation
of the heavy vehicles emissions testing laboratory, providing capacity building, and
supporting the definition of local driving cycles. The laboratory is part of the Ministry of
Transport. It has played and is expected to continue to play an important role in
generating emission data for policy decision making and enforcement6.
40. The applicability and therefore the sustainability of several of the studies financed by
the project was affected by the differences between the initial design of
TRANSANTIAGO and the one that is currently under operation, as far as the number of
buses and the network design are concerned. Even if the results of these studies are not
relevant, the methodologies behind the results are still valid and can be applied to the new
reality of TRANSANTIAGO. An example of this situation is the cost-benefit analysis of
the public transport system, which was part of the second project component.
41. The strategic environmental assessment prepared under the project's third component,
as designed, serves more as an M&E tool for assessing the quality of the public transport
system, rather than a strategic assessment. Therefore, its use as originally planned is not
possible. The latter could have been because by the time the study started there was no
single definition of a strategic environmental assessment, and the one selected fell short
from really assessing the impacts of transport measures on other sectors and vice versa.
42. The last component of the project included a variety of studies, many generating tools
for which the applicability is under consideration by the government. For instance, CGTS
is about to integrate the school location software into its geographic information system
(GIS) and will make it available on its website. Discussions are underway between CGTS
and the Municipality of Santiago for the latter to support the implementation of the traffic
calming measures in Santiago's city center developed under the project.


4
  Draft law to create incentives for the use, promotion and integration of the bicycle of 2009, which envisages, among
others, the responsibilities in terms of NMT and regulates the status of the bicycle in the transit law.
5
  Users' opinions about TRANSANTIAGO have steadily been improving since the launch in 2007. According to the
Collect ­ GfK study, in July-August 2009, the overall user satisfaction was 4.7, on a scale from 1 to 7. The January
2010 ADIMARK GfK report with the government evaluation shows that 47% of the people in Santiago approve the
way the President has been handling TRANSANTIAGO, compared to 7% in October 2007. The main differences
between the government and the opposition on TRANSANTIAGO were settled. In 2009, they approved a law to create
a temporary and a permanent subsidy to cover the operating deficit of the system (Law no. 20378).
6
  For example, the emission data of buses with post treatment filters fed the 2009 modification of the Supreme Decree
no. 130/2003 on emission standards for TRANSANTIAGO. Additionally, the laboratory is currently used in
monitoring the compliance of the bus concessionaires with the emission standards/targets.


                                                         11
43. The pilot methodologies to evaluate emission reductions developed under the project
will be part of the first phase of the implementation of an on-line emissions compensation
scheme in the Santiago metropolitan region based on a study also developed by the
project7. This scheme is expected to be later transformed into a full transaction system.
44. The results of some other studies financed under the project may be less likely to be
implemented, at least in their current form. For instance, the methodology to evaluate
urban development projects from a joint transport, environmental and urban perspective
(Metodolgia Anillo Centrico) developed under the project was not validated by the
Planning Ministry (MIDEPLAN) because, even if it constitutes an important milestone in
the area, it cannot be directly implemented and needs additional studies. The Transport
Planning Secretariat (SECTRA), the technical arm for transport planning of MIDEPLAN,
has reevaluated the methodology and is currently carrying out the additional studies to
develop an integrated evaluation methodology..Similarly the options to optimize or
reduce the need for travel may not be implemented because this topic is rather innovative
and the pilots were not carried out. The main recommendations of the study on the impact
of the introduction of full-time school day on the public transport demand are not easy to
implement because postponing the entry hours for schools is a decision that depends on
various decision makers and has manifold implications. A need for follow-up studies was
identified.
45. Finally, the congestion pricing study is ready to be implemented; however, it depends
on a difficult political decision. A law to introduce congestion pricing has been pending
in Congress since the late 90s. There is currently no concrete indication that this initiative
will go ahead. If the implementation of the study is postponed beyond a reasonable
timeframe, the background analysis and methodology will still be valid, but it will require
some major updates.
46.No Bank-financed next phase/follow-up operation is envisaged. However, the
ongoing TAL will provide an opportunity to follow-up on some of the above-mentioned
commitments.



3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
47.    The relevance is rated High.
48. The GEO, the design, and the implementation of this project are fully consistent with
the current development priorities of the Government of Chile (GoCH). President
Bachelet's Government Program8 considers a modern, efficient, and less polluting public
transport system as fundamental to creating the government's vision and desired
development leap. The Program envisages the completion of the urban transport reform
in Santiago. It explicitly refers to the importance of (i) air, visual and noise pollution
reduction, (ii) land use planning, housing and transport coordination, (iii) increased user

7
    This is envisaged in the current update of the PPDA.

participation in public transport, and (iv) a metropolitan transport authority. Additionally,
the improvement of the quality of public transport systems is among the strategic
objectives of the Transport Ministry.9
49.  The GEOs remained in line with the current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)10
since they aim at competitiveness/growth, equality of opportunity, improved quality of
life, and poverty reduction. The project also meets the current principles for Bank
engagement in Chile, which are based on development needs (mainly to alleviate poverty
and reduce inequalities), client demand, flexible and innovative responses to client
requests, and lessons sharing with Bank member countries and the international
community.
50.Finally, the GEO reflects the GEF-4 climate change strategic long-term objectives
and the strategic program for the urban transport sector. 11


3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives (GEO)
51. The achievement of the GEO to help (i) reduce GHG from ground transport in
Santiago through the promotion of a long-term modal shift to more efficient and less
polluting forms of transport and the adoption of sustainable low-GHG transport measures
(to that end, the project supported the implementation of the PTUS and its specific
objectives) and (ii) improve air quality of Santiago through reduced emissions of air
pollutants is rated Moderately Satisfactory.
52. The introduction of TRANSANTIAGO alone had significant positive impacts on the
air quality and reduced GHG emissions. Currently available data indicate that emissions
associated with the public transport system are 122.6 tons/year of particulate matter and
3,340.3 tons/year of NOx. It is expected that by December 2010, with new changes in
technology for trunk line 3 and the feeder lines, these values will be reduced by 26% and
28%, respectively, to 90 tons/year of PM and 2,406 tons/year of NOx. GHG emissions
were reduced by an estimated 98,975 tons between 2006 and 2009 (with and without
TRANSANTIAGO). This means a reduction of 10.5% compared to 2006.12 These figures
only consider improvements in the management of the bus system, including
technological changes, fuels used, quality of bus maintenance and operation, and level of
activity. They do not include modal shift in favor of public transport, on which no
conclusive data are yet available (see paragraph 62). As mentioned below, long term
modal shift is where several of the outputs of the project have a real potential to
contribute, and it could provide even more significant reductions.
53.A modal shift from cars to bikes in the project area also led to an annual reduction of
GHG emission of 1,000 tons/year. No data on the impact of increased bike use on air
quality and for bike modal shift at a citywide level are available.

54. These achievements need to be seen in the framework of the overall Bank support to
the implementation of the PTUS and can only to a limited extent be directly attributed to
project activities for a number of reasons.
55. In the first place, the GEO, as stated, depended on the implementation of the PTUS
and the achievement of its long-term objectives, on which the project had little influence.
That is, and as previously mentioned, only in the light of the concrete project activities,
the definition of the GEO was ambitious and the achievement of the specific objectives of
the PTUS fell outside the control of this project.
56. Secondly, the project outcome indicators, also called long term performance
indicators in the PAD, were also linked to the specific objectives of the PTUS and the
direct casual relationship between the outcomes and the project activities/outputs was
often missing.
57. Thirdly, except for the bicycle component, the project outputs basically consisted in
tools, such as methodologies, blue prints, instruments, and recommendations. Even if in
most cases these tools responded to a real need and were developed based on sound
foundations, their utilization and implementation is in some cases hindered by technical
and political factors. Indeed, some of the studies undertaken were based on the original
design of TRANSANTIAGO, which suffered significant modifications after its
implementation mainly in terms of number of buses and network design. As such, the
methodologies developed are useful, but their application requires further work to reflect
the current conditions of TRANSANTIAGO (e.g., the cost-benefit analysis and the
strategic environmental analysis). Also, as it is the case with congestion pricing or bus
scrapping, the implementation of the results and recommendations requires strong
political support and will.
58. Finally, a few of the expected outputs were not achieved because the planned
activities were not completed, notably the travel optimization and housing location policy
studies.
59. Based on the considerations above, the assessment of the achievement of the GEO
emphasizes on the potential and real contribution of the project activities and outputs to
the project outcomes. This assessment is given below. The detailed information on the
links between outputs by component and outcomes as well as on the outputs' contribution
to the GEO is given in annex 2.
60. Outcome 1: Urban Transport Plan for Santiago implemented. The achievement
of this outcome is rated Satisfactory. TRANSANTIAGO, the main and most important
program of the PTUS, was implemented in 2007. Although it faced serious problems at
the outset, the public transport system has kept improving over time and is now one of
the best systems in Latin America. The business model fully changed from several
thousand mostly informal owner-operators to 14 formal large operators, operating a
reduced number of buses (7,700 in 2004 to 6,400 (- 17%)) on a citywide trunk and feeder
network with a unified fare system and under stringent technical requirements.
Additionally, NMT boomed during the project period.
61. The project financed a number of studies linked to TRANSANTIAGO (e.g.
assessment of the impact of TRANSANTIAGO on the labor market and proposal of



                                            14
social mitigation measures, bus technology testing, bus scrapping study). Except for the
scrapping study, the respective results were used. Despite this, the project's contribution
to the implementation of TRANSANTIAGO was minor and in no case decisive.
62. Outcome 2: Modal share of public transport maintained. At this point in time no
conclusive data are available to rate the achievement of this indicator. The most current
data on modal share is from 2006, previous to the introduction of TRANSANTIAGO in
2007. It indicates a minor reduction in the public transport modal share from 56.6% in
2001, obtained from the Origin Destination Survey (OD survey), to 55% in 2006. This
reduction is attributed to an increase in private means other than cars (i.e., walking,
cycling, etc.).13 More current data will only be available once the next full OD survey to
take place in 2010 is completed.
63. A number of activities financed by the project have the potential to contribute to the
stabilization of public transport modal share. These are those mentioned under outcome 1
that helped to modernize the public transport system as well as those that focused on
integrating the transport and land-use dimensions and on congestion pricing. The
activities related to TRANSANTIAGO may have contributed toward stabilizing public
transport modal share, but their contribution potential is small and indirect. Congestion
pricing, if implemented, could play an important if not decisive role in favor of public
transport modal shift, but, as mentioned, it requires strong political will. A few of the
land-use related project activities have not been successfully completed and others have
not yet been implemented. In addition, their contribution potential is also small and/or
indirect.
64. Outcome 3: Land-use policies in place to favor the reduction of the average trip
length. The achievement of this indicator is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. Only a few
coordinated activities between transport and land-use agencies took place in Santiago.
The current update of the PPDA includes a chapter on land-use planning and transport,
which requires the preparation of an inter-institutional agreement to integrate Santiago's
territorial planning instruments, the PTUS and the environmental objectives of the
metropolitan region. The transport sector agencies participated in the preparation/revision
of various land use planning related instruments, such as (i) the Metropolitan Zoning Plan
for Santiago, (ii) the law on the impact of urban development on the road system, which
requires the internalizing of urban development impacts on the road system, and (iii) the
law on urban planning, which will make the impact assessment of infrastructure projects
on the road system compulsory. These documents have not yet been approved.
65. Within the framework of the project, the study to assess the impact of the full-time
school day on the transport system provided the basis for another study that will be
carried out by CGTS and SECTRA. The aim is to forecast the public transport demand
generated by the extension of Santiago's urban area proposed by MINVU in the
modification to the Santiago Metropolitan Zoning Plan. The other project financed land-
use related activities with a potential to reduce vehicle km travelled included (i)
preliminary engineering designs for the conversion of the central area of Santiago, (ii) a

13
   The 2006 data was obtained from a partial survey and an update of the information from the 2001 OD survey based
on the recompilation of several mobility surveys until 2006. So, the 2006 data is not necessarily comparable with the
2001 data.


                                                        15
methodology to include transport and land-use considerations in investment decision
making, (iii) tools to optimize school mobility, and (iv) a study to optimize travel
demand. Not all these activities were successfully completed, such as, for instance, a
study on housing location policies, and the recommendations/tools of the others have not
been implemented so far. The prospect of their implementation requires additional work,
in some cases already underway, or political will, which has not yet been assured.
However, if these tools are used and the recommendations of several of these studies are
implemented, the km travelled could be decreased.
66. Outcome 4: Barriers for introducing clean technologies for transport
removed/incentives introduced. The achievement of this indicator is rated Satisfactory.
The 2003 bidding documents for TRANSANTIAGO's bus concessions required a certain
amount of new buses with EURO III standard and post treatment filters for old buses
with lower standard. They also included a provision to extend the concession period in
case of anticipated fleet renewal. Nevertheless, due to TRANSANTIAGO's startup
problems and the consequent need to renegotiate the concessions, the filter requirements
were omitted.
67.  The current bidding documents for the renewal of the concessions include even
stricter emission standards and a provision to extend the concession period if cleaner
technologies are introduced.14 In November 2009, 72% of TRANSANTIAGO's bus fleet
was new and had Euro III standard, with about 100 vehicles with post treatment filters.
The target of the Transport Ministry is to have a close to 100% Euro III standard fleet by
May 2010, with 30% incorporating post treatment filters. Furthermore, the PPDA update
requires the Ministry of Transport to continue setting more stringent technical
requirements for the adoption of cleaner technologies in the Santiago metropolitan
region. However, while the [0]removal of barriers for cleaner technologies embedded in
the requirements for TRANSANTIAGO's concessions is mainly focused on local air
pollutants, it provides the basis for the introduction of low carbon technology
requirements once these will become affordable15.
68. The project study tested and compared the different commercially available bus
technologies in the metropolitan region using local driving cycles. This study was the
basis for a regulation with new bus standards for Santiago.16 The study did not include
CNG and hybrid diesel-electric technologies as planned since they were not available in
the market in Chile and their commercial potential is still questionable. 17 Hence, the
study focus was also on local air pollutants. Despite this difference from what was


14
   The technologies considered include Euro III or EPA98 Diesel with filter for particulate matter, Euro IV Diesel,
CNG Euro III or EPA 98, Hybrid (diesel-electric) Euro III o EPA 98, and electric buses.
15
   Currently, low carbon technologies are still not available at a price to make them financially attractive without
subsidies.
16
   Supreme Decree No. 42 of July 24, 2009, modifying Supreme Decree no. 130 of 2001, which states the emission
standards for public transport buses in the Santiago metropolitan area.
17
   CNG technology was not tested since it does not seem to be viable in Chile because of the dependency from foreign
CNG supply. A PHRD trust fund was prepared to finance the costs of temporarily importing hybrid buses. However,
the grant was not signed because CGTS was fully absorbed with solving the problems faced by TRANSANTIAGO at
its inception. Nevertheless, the private sector in Chile temporarily imported a hybrid bus and tested its fuel savings
(about 25%) and emission reduction potential. The cost of such buses is still too high to financially justify its
deployment.


                                                         16
originally envisaged, the study still provided a contribution to the introduction of clean
technologies and a tool from compliance monitoring/enforcement.
69. Outcome 5: NMT trips increased. The achievement of this indicator is rated Highly
Satisfactory. Over the project period bicycle use in the project area on sections with
bikeways increased significantly, namely 23% per year in the winter period and 12% per
year in the spring period, and modal shift from cars to bicycles was between 3% and 6%
depending on the season. Additionally, catalyzed by the project and as a result of strong
interest from civil society and government officials (GORE, Ministry of Transport,
House of Representatives, mayors), NMT is well incorporated into the government's
agenda.
70. The activities to promote NMT have been the most successful project activities, and
the project achieved more outputs than planned. As such, it is likely that the project
contributed to the increase of bicycle use in Santiago, especially considering that it
financed, among others, bikeways and that the bicycle use increase in areas with
bikeways was nearly twice as high as in areas without bikeways. Nevertheless, there is no
way to assess the exact extent of the project's contribution.
71. Outcome 6: Growth in cars-km reduced. No quantitative or qualitative data on
cars-km in Santiago are available, so the achievement of this indicator cannot be rated.
The only indication that there may have been some project-related reductions in cars-km
is the small modal shift from cars to bicycles observed in the project area. The project
also supported activities associated with public transport modernization. However, as
seen in relation to outcome 1, no information on a possible shift from public transport to
cars is yet available, and in any case, the contribution of these activities would have been
minor and indirect. Finally, the project financed studies/tools, notably those that focused
on integrating the transport and land-use dimensions and internalizing transport costs,
which if implemented, could reduce cars-km. Nevertheless, as already mentioned, while a
few of these activities were not successfully completed, in several cases the
implementation of the respective tools is dependent on further work or political will.
72.Outcome 7: Air quality indicators improved in spite of economic growth. The
achievement of this indicator is rated Satisfactory. Overall, air quality in Santiago
improved since 2003, but the project was certainly not decisive in this outcome. 18
73. The project contributed to this outcome through, among others, the activities that
helped to improve the technological requirements of TRANSANTIAGO's bus fleet, the
studies that supported TRANSANTIAGO's introduction and the bicycle related
activities. Again, this contribution was in no way decisive. The project also financed
studies to improve the decision making process by integrating transport and land use
considerations and define the conditions for the formal introduction of transport related
emissions reduction projects and the modernization of the existent emissions

18
   According to the January 2009 draft of the updated PPDA, the annual concentrations of MP10 (annual) decreased
from 75 µg/m3 in 2003 to 70 in 2007, of Ozone (8 hrs. P99) from 182 µg/m3 in 2003 to 172 in 2006, of NO2 (1 hr.
P99) from 320 µg/m3 in 2003 to 261 in 2006, of NO2 (annual) from 53 µg/m3 in 2003 to 41 in 2006, of CO (1 h P99)
from 16 µg/m3 to 12 in 2006, and of SO2 (24 hrs. P99) from 40µg/m3 in 2003 to 37 in 2006. Only the concentrations
of SO2 (annual) increased slightly from 9 µg/m3 in 2003 to 10 in 2006 and of MP10 (24 hrs. P98) from 219 µg/m3 in
2003 to 233 in 2006. No more recent data are available; however, the trend for all pollutant since 2003 has been a
decreasing one.


                                                       17
compensation market. These studies together with the one on congestion pricing, if
implemented, could make further substantial contributions to air quality improvements.
74. Outcome 8: Reduced carbon intensity per travelled km. No quantitative data exist
to rate the achievement of this indicator, but qualitative information indicates that the
outcome was likely reached. As seen under outcome 1 and 4, TRANSANTIAGO largely
operates with fewer, larger and more efficient vehicles; consequently it can be assumed
that the carbon intensity of km traveled in public transport was reduced. There was also a
small model shift from motorized to non-motorized travel; hence a consequent reduction
in carbon intensity. Finally, if some of the previously mentioned studies, notably
congestion pricing, are implemented, there is still an important potential for reductions in
the carbon intensity per travelled km.
75. Outcome 9: Evidence of behavioral change towards a rational transport
demand. There are insufficient data available to rate the achievement of this indicator as
behavioral changes take time to materialize. The only observed change so far consists in
a greater bicycle use in the project area (and elsewhere, although no survey exists).
76. As seen under outcome 2, there are no data available yet on the current public
transport modal share. Nevertheless, a well functioning TRANSANTIAGO, as it is now,
coupled with the introduction of congestion pricing could induce an important long term
modal shift in favor of public transport. The project financed a few other studies, such as
those on travel optimization and the revitalization of the city center. If implemented,
these studies could lead to decreases in motorized transport demand and more walking
and cycling. However, while the pilot projects for the first study have not been carried
out, the implementation of the others need political will.
77. In summary, five project outcome indicators, for which there are sufficient data
available to assess them, overall are considered reached. The achievement of the
remaining four outcomes mainly related to modal shift is not rated because there is no
(not yet) conclusive data available. Consequently, taking a conservative stance and
considering that (i) most of the outcomes cannot be directly attributed to the project
activities, (ii) not all project activities were carried out as planned and (iii) for many of
the project outputs there is still uncertainty regarding their implementation and use, the
achievement of the GEO is rated Moderately Satisfactory.


3.3 Efficiency
78. The economic assessment of the project at appraisal was based on an incremental cost
analysis. The assumed baseline scenario was the implementation of measures aimed at
public transport system modernization, namely the implementation of TRANSANTIAGO
that focused on reducing air pollution and improving transport, without considering GHG
emission reductions. The alternative scenario included complementary activities that
would introduce climate change considerations, i.e., congestion pricing, land-use
incentives to promote a more rational demand for transport in order to reduce average
travelled km, and an accelerated promotion and development of alternatives means of
NMT, among others. Even though the line of thought was correct, the incremental cost
analysis had a number of flaws. In the first place, the relevant incremental costs to
achieve the estimated emission reductions should have been the implementation costs of


                                             18
the different measures and not just the cost of the studies as it was done. The only
exception to this was the incremental cost estimate for the construction of bikeways. In
the second place, there was no explanation of the methodologies used to estimate the
emission reductions. Thirdly, for a number of measures, the emission reduction estimate
appeared to be ambitious.
79. Because of the previous reasons and given the fact that actual CO2 reduction data or
estimates are only available for a limited number of project activities, it is not possible to
undertake a similar incremental cost analysis to compare the appraisal scenario with the
post-project one. Still, it is interesting to at least present the available information on
GHG emission reductions. Utilizing the UNEP Clean Fleet Management toolkit, it has
been estimated that changes in the public transport system management have generated a
reduction of 98,975 tons of GHG between 2006 and 2009 (with and without
TRANSANTIAGO with 6,400 versus 7,974 buses, respectively). Additionally, a modal
shift from cars to bikes in the project area alone led to an annual GHG emission of 1,000
tons/year. For the other measures, estimates are only available for congestion pricing.
Internalizing the cost of using private cars appears to have a significant potential in terms
of GHG emission reductions. If implemented in the central area of the Municipality of
Santiago, it has been estimated that GHG emissions could be reduced by approximately
200,000 tons/year, and that this number could almost double if the area is extended to
cover a broader ring around the metropolitan area.
80. Consequently, while the originally envisaged amount of GHG emission reductions
was not achieved because the estimates were extremely ambitious, the actual reductions
seem reasonable in the light of the project design. There is also still potential for several
of the project outputs to lead to additional reductions. As shown in annex 1, the
investment cost was approximately the same as originally envisaged, except for the cost
of bikeway construction, which was twice as estimated.


3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
81. The moderately satisfactory rating is based on the combined assessment of relevance,
efficiency and the achievement of the PDOs.


3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
82. The project was designed with an environmental/GHG emission reduction focus and
did not have a poverty-specific emphasis. However, by supporting the improvement of
the public transport system, the project had positive poverty impacts since poor people
are those which use public transport most. The gender and social development
contributions of the project include:
· Increase in the number of women using bicycles (from 8% to 20%);
· Improvement of the image of NMT and possibly public transport; and
· Emission reductions, including CO2, from public transport vehicles.


                                              19
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
83.   The project contributed to institutional strengthening/changes in the following way:
·     Designing the blueprint and the emission estimation methodologies for the emission
      compensation scheme;
·     Designing the institutional setup for congestion pricing;
·     Strengthening bicycle grassroots movements and supporting the Transport
      Subsecretariat, who assumed the leadership in terms of NMT; and
·     Strengthening the government's capacity to carry out emission testing for heavy
      vehicles.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)
84.   None.


3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
85. As per ICR guidelines, this is mandatory for Intensive Learning ICRs. As such, no
surveys or workshops were conducted in the framework of this ICR preparation.



4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
86. The long term sustainability of the principal development outcomes is expected
mainly because they are linked to the successful implementation of TRANSANTIAGO
and other programs of the PTUS, such as NMT. As discussed earlier in section 2.5, the
bikeway and the public transport related activities have already been significantly scaled
up, so the long term sustainability of the related project outcomes is likely. The removal
of barriers for cleaner technologies is embedded in the requirements set for
TRANSANTIAGO's new concessions. Although they are mainly focused on local air
pollutants, they provide the basis for the introduction of low carbon technology
requirements once these become affordable.
87.  Several government initiatives show a trend toward the definition of more integrated
land-use, transport and environmental decision-making processes as described in
paragraph 64 and annex 2. While these initiatives, with the exception of the PPDA, are
still incipient, they support the achievement and hopefully the sustainability of the
associated outcomes. As far as the role of the project outputs in the sustainability of land-
use and cost internalization related outcomes is concerned, this is mixed mainly because
of the uncertainty linked to their implementation. The emission compensation scheme is
envisaged in the draft PPDA update, so the implementation of this study is likely. Once
mature, a compensation/trading scheme could play a decisive role in the reduction of both
local air pollutants and GHG emissions.
88. Some project outputs, such as the integrated land use and transport evaluation and the
Strategic Environmental Assessment methodologies, may or may not find some future
application. For other outputs, such as the revitalization projects for Santiago's city center
and the congestion pricing study, despite the fact that there is a real interest of a number


                                             20
of people/institutions to move ahead, all will depend on the political constellation of the
moment.



5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
89. Project preparation was thoroughly carried out. It was supported by a PDF-B grant
and lasted over three years. The budget for project preparation was adequate (US$
293,000). The Bank team had the right skill mix, including various seasoned
environmental and urban transport specialists as well as safeguard and fiduciary
specialists. Project preparation was based on detailed background studies. As previously
mentioned, the ToR for the project activities and the technical specifications for the
bikeways were ready at the time of appraisal. A number of participatory events
(consultative workshop) to fine-tune project design were held, and NGOs were consulted
in the definition of the ToR. Frequent preparation missions were carried out. These
missions were documented in detailed Aide Memoires.
90. The PAD is well-written and comprehensive in its coverage. It shows an in-depth
knowledge of the sector issues at the time of appraisal. The PAD carefully takes into
account the safeguard policies and fiduciary aspects of Bank projects. Much detail went
also in the design of the M&E framework, something not yet common at the time the
project was prepared.
91. For all these reasons, Bank performance at ensuring quality at entry would be highly
satisfactory. In hindsight, however, it appears that the project scope was broad, focusing
on too many different areas and including too many implementation agencies. This made
project implementation difficult. Moreover, even if this project is part of a larger Bank
support package to the implementation of the PTUS, the GEO were overly ambitious
since the project activities had little influence and no control over them. Consequently,
because of this and some other shortcomings in M&E design pointed out in sections 2.1
and 2.3, Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is only considered satisfactory.
This rating is confirmed in the Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA7) carried out in
September 2005, which rated the project satisfactory overall, as well as in each of the
dimensions reviewed. The only concern raised related to "the manner in which the PAD
articulated the GEO of the project".
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
92. The Bank supervision team had an adequate skill mix. It included a transport and an
environmental specialist as well as fiduciary specialists. Regular supervision missions to
Santiago took place, during which the Bank team met with the project implementation
agencies and different stakeholders, including government officials, civil society
representatives, decision makers at local and national level, and project consultants. The



                                            21
missions included site visits. Safeguard and fiduciary aspects were adequately taken into
account. The results of the missions were documented in detailed aide memories.
93. The project team reviewed ToR and project reports, provided technical advice and
helped addressing implementation issues. Despite a relatively rigid description of the
project activities, the team showed creativity to solve implementation problems and adapt
the project activities to changed local conditions. After the introduction of
TRANSANTIAGO, which almost totally stopped project implementation during one
year, Bank supervision was intensified through nearly monthly virtual supervisions via
conference calls. This together with a closing date extension helped to bring project
implementation again under control. During the last few years of project implementation,
Bank supervision put a lot of effort into ensuring the use and sustainability of the outputs
created by the project. The project team together with CGTS discussed different
sustainability options and met with key stakeholders, such as the Major of Santiago and
the Intendente (Head of the GORE).
94. As such, Bank supervision was highly satisfactory. However, the two changes in task
team leader (TTL) during project supervision may have temporarily loosened Bank
attention and guidance for some innovative project activities, such as the strategic
environmental assessment. In hindsight, it also seems clear that after the mid-term
review, which clearly identified the disconnect between project scope/activities and the
GEO/specific objectives, the project should have been restructured to ensure a better
alignment. Therefore, the Bank's performance during this phase is rated satisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
95.Since Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry and quality of supervision are
considered satisfactory, the overall Bank performance is also considered satisfactory.


5.2 Borrower
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
96.  The GoCH participated in project preparation mainly through a number of
government agencies, such as SECTRA, CONAMA and CGTS, but representatives of the
Transport and Finance Ministries interacted also directly with the Bank team. The GoCH
supported the PTUS at the highest level, put in place an enabling environment for the
project, and involved the respective stakeholders. Hence, the GoCH's contribution to
project preparation was adequate. During project implementation, the GoCH provided the
necessary counterpart funds in a timely manner and stuck to the institutional
arrangements defined and agreements taken at appraisal. The high level commitment to
the PTUS, thus to the GEO and the stated project outcomes, grew even stronger over the
lifetime of this project, with the GoCH doing everything possible to make
TRANSANTIAGO work. As such, on the one hand, channeling most of the efforts to
TRANSANTIAGO at a moment when implementation problems of the new system
caused enormous distress to the users and risked to collapse the government was essential
to save TRANSANTIAGO and to achieve the project outcomes related to the


                                            22
implementation of the PTUS. On the other hand, it slowed down project implementation
and negatively impacted some activities.
97. Therefore, while the performance of the GoCH in terms of commitment to the PTUS
and hence the project GEO and outcomes was highly satisfactory, its immediate attention
to the implementation of the project activities had shortcomings. Consequently, the
overall government performance is rated only satisfactory.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
98. Especially SECTRA, the implementation agency of the PDF-B grant and the main
Bank interlocutor during project preparation, CGTS and CONAMA contributed
significantly to the design of the project. All three institutions were actively involved in
project preparation, and their technical knowledge and experience was fundamental to
prepare a technically robust and sound operation. The other technical project counterparts
and a number of civil society representatives also had an active involvement in project
design. The involvement and coordination of a large number of actors was facilitated by
the existence of the PDF-B grant, which had already brought together many of them.
99.  Initially the project implementation team within CGTS was small and not exclusively
dedicated to the project. Despite this, they did a great job to coordinate the large number
of technical implementation agencies. The team had the adequate technical knowledge
and experience and the fiduciary aspects were carried out in a satisfactory manner. The
delays that occurred during the first years of project implementation were mainly due to
lengthy procurement procedures and difficulties, such as the lack of bidders, as well as
problems with the quality of consultants.
100. As mentioned in paragraph 28, during the TRANSANTIAGO crisis the only
professional assigned to the project was not able to keep up with the ongoing activities
and no new activities took place. This brought project implementation nearly to a still
stand. Once the crisis was over, the project implementation team was again adequately
staffed. However, about a year and a half before project completion, the coordinator left.
Even if a few members of the implementation team had already been involved in some of
the project implementation activities since 2007, this momentarily weakened the team,
especially in terms of Bank procurement. Indeed, this was when some relatively minor
shortcomings mainly due to the unfamiliarity with Bank procurement rules and
procedures became evident (see paragraph 35). It is necessary to point out that the
moderately satisfactory project implementation ratings during the last year of project
supervision were due to difficulties/delays in completing procurement processes and
ongoing studies. However, once the new project implementation team went through the
phase of adaptation and adjustment, they managed to give the ongoing project activities
an important final push. This eventually led to the timely conclusion of these activities
before project end and the achievement of the parts of the objectives under their control.
Finally, it is also necessary to highlight the exceptional efforts made by this
implementation team to ensure the application and sustainability of project products and
recommendations, which were outside their direct sphere of responsibility.
101.In general, the technical agencies did an exemplary job in terms of ToR preparation
and study supervision. Reports were thoroughly reviewed normally by at least three


                                            23
agencies. They provided excellent comments and high-quality technical contributions and
requested further analyses for nearly all reports, even if this implied additional
supervision work.
102.Overall, while under the given conditions the implementation unit and most of the
technical agencies did a highly satisfactory job in terms of project implementation, some
implementation processes took longer than originally envisaged, toward project end there
were weaknesses in the capacity to carry out Bank procurement, and the commitment of a
few technical agencies did fade over time. Hence, the on the whole performance of the
implementation agencies is considered satisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
103.Given the satisfactory rating for both the government and the implementation agency
performances, the overall Borrower performance is also rated satisfactory.



6. Lessons Learned
104. In addition to the recurring operational lessons that can be drawn from most Bank
projects, this GEF intervention provided some strategic and technical lessons. These
lessons, which are presented in the next paragraphs, can inform the design of similar
operations and the preparation of the next CPS for Chile.
105.   Recurring operational lessons learned include the following:
106. There is a need to be realistic when defining the GEO and to ensure good
monitoring and evaluation. The GEO should be closely linked to the project activities,
and indicators should be designed so as to ensure that they serve as good monitoring tools
for the project activities, i.e. indicators with a solid link to both the project activities and
the GEO, that set clear quantitative target values and that are measurable. Good
monitoring and evaluation (a) provides sound information for the redesign of activities
during implementation, which, for instance, was the case with the design of the bicycle
promotion campaign, (b) helps policy makers justify their own interventions, which in
this operation probably fostered the wave of other investments in bike infrastructure, and
(c) is very useful for ICR preparation. More training for Bank operational staff and/or the
dedication of a specialist who supports Bank teams in the design of the monitoring and
evaluation framework is highly recommended.


107.The project team and Bank management should have taken advantage of the
assessment carried out during the mid-term review and project restructuring should
have taken place, independently of the workload this implies, especially for GEF
projects. This would have helped to better match the GEO with the project activities.
108.The choice of the implementation agency and the technical counterparts is
crucial for a multisectorial project. The implementation of a multisectorial project
would be facilitated if the agency in charge of project implementation is hierarchically



                                              24
above the technical counterparts and has a direct saying or strong leverage over the
implementation of project outputs.
109.   The more strategic lessons include the following:
110. A project supporting a broad government program, such as the PTUS, is more
difficult to implement and hence more risky. Therefore, the Bank should be more
selective in terms of the areas to be supported, limiting support to a small number of
areas or activities, possibly inter-related and/or reinforcing each another. The design
of this project followed the PTUS, which is a broad and ambitious urban transport
agenda. Hence, it included activities that involved not only the transport sector at
different levels (CGTS, Transport Subsecretariat, municipalities), but also the urban
planning, housing, education, environmental and other sectors. This made the project
more complex, more difficult to implement and riskier. Hence, in hindsight, it would
have been preferable to limit the project scope to the parts of the PTUS with the strongest
ownership and commitment. Otherwise, the project should have accounted for the
additional complexity and riskiness through additional mitigation measures as well as the
definition of less ambitious objectives and outcomes.
111. The involvement of champions and decision makers during project
implementation is fundamental, but not sufficient. Although the emphasis of the
project was on broad stakeholder participation, the inclusion in the implementation
process of real decision makers fell short because in many cases the counterparts only
included technicians. The inclusion of real decision makers, however, is not sufficient
since their participation must also be representative of the role they play in the decision
making process. For instance, an important reason why the revitalization measures for
downtown Santiago have not yet been implemented is the relatively small weight given
to the Municipality of Santiago's opinion on this topic. Indeed, the Municipality of
Santiago was one of several consulted stakeholders, all with equal weight, while in reality
the decision to implement these measures is completely in the hands of the Municipality.
112.Regular virtual supervision via conference calls has proven very useful in this
project. After the problems with TRANSANTIAGO, the project implementation rhythm
and quality greatly benefited from the monthly virtual supervision via conference calls.
113.   Finally, the project also provided a number of technical lessons:
114. The Bank can play an important role in the transport sector even in countries
with an advanced stage of development like Chile. Despite the sophistication of the
urban transport sector in Chile, which is certainly one of the most modern and efficient in
Latin America, the Bank still can provide value added. As an example, by analyzing
congestion pricing from all different angles, the GEF project was able to bring this topic,
which historically has been politically sensitive in Chile and whose discussion had come
to a standstill, back on the table. Indeed, this study provides the technical, institutional,
legal and financial information needed for well-informed decision making on sound
technical grounds.
115. The success of the bicycle component was mainly the result of the high buy-in of
different levels of government and the existence of a very active civil society, from
which the project was able to capitalize with properly timed interventions and close



                                              25
supervision. The latter allowed for the redesign of some project activities according
to real needs. NMT was a specific program of the PTUS and part of the presidential
campaign of president Lagos. Champions existed at several levels: (i) municipalities,
with some municipalities having their own NMT agenda; (ii) regions, with GORE's
active role in promoting NMT and the availability of funding for reaching the target of
690 km of bikeways by 2012; (iii) ministries, with the active role of the Transport
Subsecretariat as the entity responsible to promote NMT in the whole country; (iv) and
legislature, with the draft "Bicycle Law" and the PPDA. In addition, strong grassroots
movements were able to engage in the discussion at government level, becoming key
members of technical working groups that helped define the future of NMT in Chile. The
project was able to take advantage of this context by: (i) providing visibility to the efforts
of those champions through the GEF events/bikeways, especially during the preparatory
phase of the project; (ii) concentrating GEF resources on a relative small area and
therefore consolidating a network of bikeways in relatively wealthy municipalities that
had a NMT agenda; (iii) supporting the inclusion of grassroots movements as part of the
development of the promotional campaign and definition of key interventions (e.g.,
educational campaign, brochures, definition of bike parking strategy, etc); (iv) financing
the monitoring study that provided information to feed into the decision making process;
and (v) encouraging the active involvement of the Transport Subsecretariat in the area of
NMT.
116.Promoting new technologies has its challenges and risks that must be factored in
during project preparation. The design of a relatively large project activity was based
on the assumption that the availability of specific bus technologies, i.e. CNG buses and
diesel-electric hybrids, could be secured during project implementation with additional
resources from a separate trust fund. Eventually, however, both the temporary
importation of hybrid buses for testing and the securing of trust fund resources turned out
to be impossible (for further details see annex 2).

*This amount is much higher than envisaged because the Municipalities in the project area constructed
more bikeways than planned.
** Since staff who worked in this project generally participated in activities of different components and
their timesheets are not available by component, the respective salary cost was included in project

                           municipalities took place. The campaign included: (a) the development of promotional and
                           educational material; (b) promotional events; (c) training on bicycle riding and safety in 90
                           schools, and (d) provision of bicycle parking facilities in 10 schools for 30 bikes each. Bicycle
                           grassroots organizations actively participated in the development of the different components of
                           the campaign. These same groups continue to be part of the round tables organized by the
                           Transport Subsecretariat as part of its work to promote NMT. No information about the
                           effectiveness of the campaign is available because it was one of the last deliverables of the
                           project and it did not match with the timing of the monitoring study on bicycle use. The
                           campaign was shorter and started later than originally anticipated because of problems with the
                           consultant that had been originally hired to undertake this task. The contract with the consultant
                           was cancelled and a new promotional strategy with the help of the grassroots organizations and a
                           core group hired for the same tasks was developed instead.

                           Transport Subsecretariat (http://mnm.subtrans.cl).
                      ·    The project also financed the design of bike parking facilities. Due to procurement difficulties,
                           the project did not finance the implementation of these facilities on a pilot basis. However, the
                           Transport Subsecretariat, who also undertook a couple of complementary studies on bicycle
                           parking, has launched a pilot program on bicycle parking in the metropolitan region22. The pilot
                           program will include 20 sites for short-term parking and 8 for long-term parking, for a total
                           budget of approximately US$ 270,000. The latter will use the designs generated by the project.
                           The final target is to reach 200 sites throughout the metropolitan region. Parking facilities are
                           also being implemented by several municipalities, such as Providencia.
                      ·    Finally, the project financed an international seminar to exchange knowledge and experiences on
                           bike infrastructure design and bike use promotion.

    largely depend on the will of the new government administration. Still, one of the positive
    features of the study is its focus on a pilot-area rather than a broader area, which would hopefully
    reduce the opposition to its implementation. Because the area affected would cover an area within
    the Municipality of Santiago only, a special role was given to the Municipality to provide
    feedback about the benefits and impacts of such measure. No definition of the position of the
    Municipality in reference to the implementation of congestion pricing has been determined yet.
·   Traffic calming measures designed for Santiago's city center including completion of

    estimate. An important feature of this study was the high involvement of the community through
    extensive citizen's consultation, formally included in the tasks to be performed by the consultant.
    None of the proposed measures have been implemented yet, and the prospect of their
    implementation requires political will, which has not yet been secured. CGTS together with the
    Bank team met with the Municipality of Santiago and the new Mayor to discuss the potential
    implementation of the proposed measures. The Mayor asked his staff to examine the proposed

·   Design of legal, financial and institutional options for the incorporation of GHG emission
    reductions into the emission reduction trading program from mobile and fix sources in

    examined this issue was supported by the project. Nevertheless, the complexities associated with
    the development of a "Cap and Trade" type market that also includes a voluntary market (as it is
    the case with transport related projects), even only for local pollutants, changed the focus of the
    study. The latter went towards examining and providing recommendations on how to design the
    local online emission compensation market first, without the additional complexities of
    considering GHG. Once a local operation is well established, the assessment of the feasibility of a
    more complex mechanism that also includes GHG could be undertaken. According to the draft
    PPDA, this local online emission compensation market has to be implemented within one year of
    the effectiveness of the PPDA.
    Still, the project supported the generation of five methodologies for the standardization of the
    identification, estimation and monitoring of emission reductions that also considered GHG from a
    co-benefit perspective (efficient operation of buses, vehicle scrapping, hybrid buses, post-
    treatment filters, and firewood stoves). An additional activity developed the software tool for the
    online application of the methodologies to real life projects. It is expected that these
    methodologies and the online computational tool will help improve the liquidity of the incipient
    market that currently exists.
    Finally, the design of the compensation scheme with the inclusion of mobile sources required a
    reliable way to quantify public transport emissions. This pushed CGTS to develop an innovative
    tool, using Airviro24, to monitor, quantity and control local and GHG emissions of the public
    transport in Santiago on a continuous basis. This information will also be used to update the
    emission targets for public transport concessionaires.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
The project was thought as one that would support measures aimed at removing barriers
for changing cultural behavior and transport demand patterns; improving the public
transport system; and incorporating the environmental dimension in urban transport, and
land-use planning. As such, all these measures would have an impact on the level of
GHG emissions, and as identified at appraisal, measures promoted under the project
would only be effective, in terms of reducing GHG, in the long-run, lead by the
implementation of TRANSANTIAGO.
The economic assessment of the project at appraisal was based on an incremental cost
analysis. The baseline scenario assumed that the implementation of measures aimed at
restructuring the public transport system, namely implementing TRANSANTIAGO,
focused on reducing air pollution and improving transport, without considering GHG
emission reductions. The alternative scenario, therefore, included complementary
activities that would introduce climate change considerations, i.e., congestion pricing,
land-use incentives to promote a more rational demand for transport in order to reduce
average travelled km, and an accelerated promotion and development of alternatives
means of NMT, among others. Even though the line of thought was correct, the
incremental cost analysis had a number of flaws. In the first place, the relevant
incremental costs to achieve the estimated emission reductions should have been the
implementation costs of the different measures and not just the cost of the studies as it
was done. The only exception to this was the incremental cost estimate for the
construction of bikeways. In second place, there was no explanation of the methodologies
used to estimate the emission reductions. Thirdly, for a number of measures, the emission
reduction estimate appeared to be ambitious.
Because of the previous reasons and given the fact that actual CO2 reduction data or
estimates are only available for a limited number of project activities, it is not possible to
undertake a similar incremental cost analysis to compare the appraisal scenario with the
post-project one.
Indeed, with the exception of the NMT component, the project mainly developed tools,
blue prints and methodologies that for the most part have not been implemented yet,
making it difficult, at this point in time, to assess the real effectiveness of the measures in
terms of reducing GHG emissions. Even if the measures were implemented, it would be
difficult to isolate the impact on GHG emissions of the measure, given that its success is
determined by the quality of the transport system itself. For example, congestion pricing
would not work if no alternative means of transport at a minimum quality is provided.
Still, it should be noted that most recommendations and tools, if implemented, have the
potential to promote modal shift, where a relevant amount of GHG emission reductions
could be generated.
Even if the above is true, it is interesting to at least present the available information on
GHG emission reduction, namely that of the implementation of TRANSANTIAGO, the
construction of bikeways and some preliminary estimates of congestion pricing.
Utilizing the UNEP Clean Fleet Management toolkit, it has been estimated that the GHG
emissions were reduced by approximately 98,975 tons between 2006 and 2009 (with and


                                              38
without TRANSANTIAGO with 6,400 versus 7,974 buses, respectively), that is a
reduction of 10.5% compared to 2006. These figures only consider improvements in the
management of the bus system including technological changes, fuels used, quality of bus
maintenance and operation, and level of activity; they do not include modal shift.
Additionally, a modal shift from cars to bikes in the project area led to an annual
reduction of GHG emission of 1,000 tons/year (between 3-6% of bikers in the project
area reported that they would have previously used their cars instead for the same trip).
No data for bike modal shift on a citywide level are available. Congestion pricing appears
to have a significant potential in terms of GHG emission reduction. If implemented in the
central area of the Municipality of Santiago, it has been estimated that GHG emission
could be reduced by approximately 200,000 tons/year, and that this number could almost
double if the area is extended to cover a broader ring around the metropolitan area.
The table below summarizes the findings as well as the estimates at appraisal.

                       CONTRIBUTION OF THE RECIPIENT

1. Introduction

The World Bank, in its role as Executing Agency of the Global Environment Facility,
granted to the Recipient the "GEF Grant TF020392", in line with what is documented in
the Grant Agreement dated January 6, 2004.

Considering the proximity of the implementation of an ambitious Transport Plan for
Santiago, the Project had the following objectives: (i) to help reducing greenhouse gases
(GHG) generated by land transport in Metropolitan Santiago through the promotion of a
long-term shift toward more efficient and less polluting transport modes as well as
through the adoption of sustainable transport measures with lower GHG, and (ii) to help
improving the air quality in Santiago through reductions of emissions, such as SOx, CO,
PM10 and NOx.

2. Formulation and implementation of Transantiago, GEF's role

The Santiago Urban Transport Plan 2000 to 2010 (PTUS) is a direct precursor in the
design of the Transport Plan for Santiago, Transantiago. The PTUS is a proposal to
implement a comprehensive public policy for the city aiming at improving the quality of
life in all aspects related to transport. Its main objectives included improving transport
services at lower cost, reducing significantly the environmental impacts, achieving better
urban planning, optimizing travel time, and promoting personal safety.

While all programs included in the PTUS were of great importance and complementary
to achieve the proposed objectives, the program with the highest priority as well as the
most technical and social complexities, which formed the basis for all other programs,
was the Program for the Modernization and Integration of Public Transport Services
(Program 1 of PTUS). This Program 1 is what ultimately constituted the Transport Plan
for Santiago, Transantiago. It focused primarily on areas such as the restructuring of bus
routes and the way they operated; the introduction of a new payment system for public
transport; the corporatization of the operators; the introduction of new management
forms; the construction of specialized infrastructure; professional driver training; citizen
participation and dialogue; and management of the environmental impacts of the
transport system.



                                            45
Three years after the difficult start (of Transantiago), the positive results of the public
transport modernization are visible, and are being recognized by various actors of the
society, both in Chile and internationally.

The GEF project was an important complement to the policies and basic guidelines for
the environmental sustainability of the Plan and a means to advance with the
development of the additional programs of the PTUS. It also allowed, during the difficult
years of the implementation of the Plan (Transantiago), to carry out a series of
comprehensive and interdisciplinary studies, establishing sound foundation to advance
with the proposed ambitious objectives.

3. Achievement of objectives and key developments

Given the nature of the Recipient's Contribution, only the main aspects regarding the
progress in different areas and the achievement of the objectives of the Project are
described. It is understood that the latter is exhaustively described in the World Bank
Project Implementation and Completion Report (ICR) and in other project related
documents.

The difference in the degree of compliance with the Project objectives depended on both
the conditions and the circumstances of the complex implementation of Transantiago and
the respective organizational priorities as well as the ambitious nature of these objectives.
The objectives more favorably evaluated, mainly for its short-term results, are those
related to promoting bicycle use and public transport modernization. Conversely, there
are activities that while not able to fully meet the proposed objectives, such as some
related to the Land Use and Transport Cost Internalization Component, they constitute a
valuable foundation to progress in this direction for both the Ministry of Transport and
Telecommunications and MIDEPLAN25, especially through SECTRA26, or to implement
policies in this regard by other institutions (MINEDUC27, MINVU28).

One of the historical challenges for public transport since the early days of Transantiago
has been to maintain its modal share. While this will ultimately be evaluated through
future origin - destination (ODS), based on the data of the 2006 ODS, it is possible to
deduce that the shift of public transport trips before the implementation of Transantiago
was not toward private transport, but toward "other," which considers alternatives, such
as walking and bicycle use. With Transantiago already stabilized, it will be important to
assess, through the above-mentioned surveys, if this trend continues and if the influence
of favorable aspects, such as the above-mentioned stabilization of the system, the greater
supply of Metro services or a combination of both of them, have favored it.

As for non-motorized trips, specifically bicycle trips, it is necessary to point out that there
has been a steady increase in the use of this means of transport in the city of Santiago.
The different stakeholder related to this topic agree that one of the initial cornerstone of
this increase was the Project, which through its studies, promotion campaign and the
construction of bicycle facilities was the basis of the local networks in the three
participating municipalities (Santiago, Providencia y Ñuñoa).



                                              46
The important work of the organizations as well as the efforts of various sectors of the
Chilean Government helped to enhance such consolidation. This finally led to the
allocation of the institutional coordination of the different initiatives on the topic to the
Regional Government for infrastructure matters and to the Ministry of Transport and
Telecommunications for matters related to policy, promotion and regulation. In this way,
initiatives, such as the Santiago Bicycle Plan, considered a so-called "Bi-century Project"
(Proyecto Bicentenario) and later the specific draft law as well as the modification on
these issues in the General Law for Land Use and Construction, were created.

It is important to point out that during the 2009, the Division of Studies and Development
(DED) of the Transport Subsecretariat took the leadership and the coordination of non-
motorized transport for the entire country. In this context, it developed a set of initiatives
to promote the construction of facilities for these transport modes in the country. In
addition, SECTRA developed a simplified social assessment methodology, which was
approved by MIDEPLAN. Moreover, bicycle paths are being incorporated in Urban
Transport System Development Plans, prepared by SECTRA for the main cities of the
country. With this, within these institutions the topic receives an active and permanent
role.

As mentioned above, in addition to its participation as a counterpart to the Project studies,
the Subsecretariat provided support in the technical implementation of the bicycle
component under the responsibility of CONSASET29. Toward project end, it also played
an active role in the implementation of the different contracts of this component,
coordinating the activities with national guidelines and projects. It is important to note
that to more adequately pursue different policies in the field of promoting bicycle use, the
Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications established this year a new institutional
structure within the Division of Studies and Development, called Sustainable Transport
Unit, which will be responsible for further developments in this area. Among others, the
promotion and implementation of bicycle parking projects are the most important tasks of
this unit to guarantee the continuity of the bicycle component.

With regard to existing data, although there are no surveys for the entire city, the 2006
ODS already showed signs of increased bicycle use, with a 2% modal share in 2001,
which increased to 2.9% in 2006. In the communities affected by the project, the
Monitoring Plan detected an average annual growth rate of 15% since 2004 until the
closing date of the project, which in the areas with bikeways increased to 23%.
Additionally, there was a modal shift from the private car to the bicycle between 3% to
6%, depending on the season. This directly contributes to the objective of reducing CO2
emissions through a decrease in polluting trips compared to the baseline.

As for the reduction in bicycles accidents, CONASET records show that while accidents
have increased, this is correlated to the large increase in bicycle use and not necessarily to
a decrease in safety. Furthermore, studies related to the GEF project revealed that when
building bicycle facilities, accidents and their severity do not increase, which is shown by
comparing the results obtained by the Monitoring Plan in Providence and Ñuñoa. The



                                             47
studies also showed an increase in women who ride bicycles, which is attributed to a
large extent to the conditions of security and road safety in Santiago, as pointed out by
the specialist and project consultant Mr. Ricardo Montezuma.

In addition to what has been developed in the GEF project, the Plan Transantiago has
helped to increase bicycle use through the construction of bus corridors, which include
bikeways. These constitute structural axes of the city's network, complemented by local
initiatives. All this is coordinated within the city's bicycle path master plan in the
framework of the Santiago Bicycle Plan.

The importance given by the Coordination Transantiago (CGTS) to the environment and
the contributions to improve Santiago's air quality through the implementation of the
GEF Project is seen not only in its operational management but also in the various actions
it has implemented that show a permanent concern for the harmonious development
between the mission of providing an efficient transport system and improving air quality
in the city, in order to generate the least impact on its operations. In this context, it was
establish that for Transantiago emission control and monitoring, including greenhouse
gas emission, is an absolute priority, which means that it has to be considered in all its
operations and that it must involve each of the operators in the system.

In line with this stated priority, Transantiago is committed to meet the emission reduction
targets set for public transport in the Environmental Prevention and Clean-up Plan for the
Metropolitan Region (PPDA), which set a target of 75% reductions in emissions of
particulate matter (PM) and 40% reduction in nitrogen oxides (NOx), compared to the
values of the 1997 emission inventory.

In 2007, the emission targets were met satisfactorily - 79.6% for PM and 66.5% for
NOx30. At the end of 2009 the reductions continued, adding reduction of 48% in PM and
41% in NOx compared to the 2005 emissions inventory for the Metropolitan Region31.
Since filters were not incorporated into the buses with technology Euro I and Euro II, to
comply with the emission reduction targets it was decided to move ahead of the
regulations. It is worthwhile pointing out that by the end of 2010 the fleet composition
will consist of approximately 6,200 buses with 100% Euro III technology, of which 41%
will have particulate post- treatment filters. The estimated reductions are about 66% in
PM and 41% in NOx compared to the 2005 Inventory32.

In the framework of this technological development and anticipating the environmental
requirements regarding the mandatory use of filters in new vehicles entering the
metropolitan area33, CGTS has included these requirements into the bidding of the
concessions for new routes. This was the case of the recent bidding for the trunk line 3,
where the bidding documents required that the proposed fleet incorporated buses with
Transantiago standard as well as particulate post treatment filters with an efficiency of at
least 90%. The same criterion of efficiency will be included in future biddings for feeder
services.

Therefore, the Project studies with an environmental focus and the subsequent studies
carried out on the basis of the results of the former have been useful tools to monitor the
compliance with the measures outlined in the PPDA. In this way, thanks to the improved
knowledge of the technical teams and the measures implemented by the institutions
involved, the contribution of public transport to the concentration of anthropogenic origin
passed from 22% to 8% between 2000 and 2005.

The contribution of the GEF Project to these outcomes is related to the results obtained in
the Public Transport Modernization Component. The studies carried out under this
component, through the definition of driving cycles and the operational monitoring of
public transport buses in Santiago, helped to obtain an economic and environmental
assessment of traditional and non-traditional bus technologies that contributed to the
scientific basis for decision making.

The study `'Integrated Design of an Emissions Compensation System for the
Metropolitan Region of Santiago" deserves special attention for two reasons. It helped to
generate the technical basis and fundamental guidelines for the design of a transaction
market for the local market of fixed and mobile sources. It also provided an advance in
the design of a computer application aiming at applying the design elements of the study
in a way that both sectors, through the compensation system, will be able to compensate
emissions as an alternative to comply with the targets imposed by the Plan (PPDA). For
Transantiago, the development of this tool is a big advance compared to the existing
methodologies to calculate emissions. The 3CV's chassis dynamometer (financed partly
through the Project and also used to carry out heavy freight vehicle tests and to develop
an activity dedicated to the monitoring/supervision of buses) and the improvement of
emission factors will allow to create the basis to require the compliance with (emission)
targets and the development of an emission transaction/compensation market for
Transantiago's bus operators.


4. Bank performance

The Bank team for this Project was proactive and highly skilled. It was able to
satisfactorily handle the Project, achieving a good balance with the local implementation
team to successfully conclude it. Sometimes this was no easy task given the complexity
of some issues, the institutional relations of our country as well as the aforementioned
implementation of Transantiago, in relation to which it is important to mention that the
Bank demonstrated at all times great support.

5. Performance of the Recipient

It is important to point out that the Recipient went ahead with the projects even in
circumstances in which the Government itself recognized its responsibilities in the
shortcomings for the design and implementation of Transantiago. It focused on a fast and
strong reaction in order to move ahead with the operation of the (public transport) system
(the respective results can be seen today). To illustrate this, at the moment when the
progress in project implementation was less than expected because of the above-


                                            49
mentioned circumstances, the head of CGTS gave it his complete support and priority.
This new situation required an extension of the grant. The Project implementation team
was strengthened, assigning professionals with exclusive or predominant dedication (to
the Project) and including in the technical team experts in the environmental, social and
urban areas. The implementation responsibility was assigned to a complete unit of the
Technical Coordination (Environmental and Territorial Unit) and a important part to the
Financial Coordination, keeping the priorities in this area of the professionals with
exclusive or partial dedication, who since the beginning carried out the financial aspects
of the Project. In this way, the GEF Grant Agreement as well as the other ongoing
agreements were put at the same level as the other priority challenges, which CGTS
needed to move ahead in a satisfactory way.

These measures came at the expense of continuity in the team, which was partly
compensated by the fact that two professionals of the new team had already been working
in the project for some time. In addition, there was the experience of the professionals
responsible for the financial aspects. Toward the end of the project, all this was supported
with training provided by Bank experts.

Furthermore, in order to successfully complete all the studies, the technical support
provided by other ministries and institutions, such as the CONAMA and SECTRA, was
fundamental from an institutional and professional point of view, maintaining continuity
throughout the projects.

6. Lessons Learned

As pointed out previously, the greatest difficulty in ensuring the short and medium term
success of the proposed objectives was the development of the projects related to
integrated urban planning between the land-use and transport sectors. This required an
intersectoral work that needs an institutional strength with regard to the interference on
other institutions both for decision-making and for the definition of working guidelines,
which does not exist today. This was the case mainly for the consultant assignments to
develop an integrated evaluation methodology for urban projects (although this line of
work has been continued by SECTRA, it is a long term project). It was also the case for
the studies on strategic environmental assessment (SEA), efficient location of housings,
travel optimization, study trips, and congestion pricing, among others. Thus, in general
terms, there is a need in the stage of identification and design of a project with these
characteristics to analyze how ambitious or feasible it is to achieve the proposed
objective in line with the existing institutional reality.

In more specific terms, despite the good results obtained in the Bicycle Use Promotion
Component, the promotion activities required additional efforts which are not the ones of
an implementation team. There was a need to coordinate 9 interrelated contracts, which
required a very specific expertise related to the production of campaigns. In hindsight, an
analysis of this experience leads to the conclusion that these contracts should have been
coordinated by a single specialized company in the area, facilitating the control of the




                                            50
products. This is because this type of tasks is outside the spheres of activity of the project
coordinating agency.

In short, concerning the development of the projects, among others, it can be pointed out
that:
    - The objectives of the projects must be realistic with regard to the implementation
        possibilities and institutional functions.
    - The commitments of the Ministries or Services of the technical counterparts must
        be such that a change in the teams does not affect the normal development of the
        project.
    - It is necessary that the implementation teams receive continuous training
        regarding Bank procedures.
    - It is also necessary to train the support agencies (in this case the UNDP) in order
        to harmonize their procedures with respect to those of the Bank.

7. Conclusions

On the basis of the considerations above, the Recipient considers the overall rating of the
Project "Satisfactory"." Among others, it is important to point out the following aspects:
The contribution of the Recipient in achieving the increase in bicycle use, the
improvement of the citizen perception with regard to this mode, the increase of the share
of women using it, the strengthening of the civil society organizations related to the urban
cycling, the institutionalization of the promotion of non-motorized transport within both
the Transport Subsecretariat and the Metropolitan Regional Government of Santiago, and
finally a recovery of the confidence of the cyclists organizations, which had been lost
with the first promotion experience in this Project.

With regard to the progress and lessons on sustainability and environmental management,
due to the actions undertaken to comply with the commitments of the project, the results
of the studies and the acquired knowledge base, there is currently an explicit strategic
guideline in CGTS to take into account these issues. In order to develop this guideline,
there are not only adequate tools, but also a professional team with the relevant
experience and a line of action that goes in the above-mentioned direction. Thus, there is
a proposal to set up a platform that allows integrating air quality monitoring, considering
factors such as the meteorological, management, and traffic network monitoring,
modeling of the in-depth contamination and noise levels, among others, as well as a
general model that integrates all the previous models. All this to create a platform that
allows integrating all these aspects in an effective way into a larger environmental
management and of urban traffic system, similarly to what is is currently carried out in
European cities that lead this topic (Rome, Paris, Berlin, etc.)

Given the stabilization of the operation of Transantiago, the satisfactory results obtained
through the Project and in line the remaining challenges, both the new ones and those not
completely resolved by the Project, it is recommended to think about developing a second
phase of this, or in its absence, a similar project with such characteristics to tackle these
challenges.

        COMMENTS OF THE RECIPIENT ON THE BANK'S DRAFT ICR


The only comment received from the Recipient and not incorporated in the Bank's ICR
refers to the outcome rating and is the following: "Indeed, we believe that the rating that
best reflects the Project is "Satisfactory" since according to our understanding the
majority of the objectives of the projects have been achieved in a satisfactory way. This is
shown by the Bank's ratings assigned to each aspect and objective of the Project, with
which we agree. In addition, there is the fact that this achievement was possible despite
the adverse circumstances, which affected the Project in different phases."
