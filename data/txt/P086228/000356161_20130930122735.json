PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Civil Service Capacity\n            Building Project for Afghanistan were as follows: outcomes\n            were unsatisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            substantial; Bank performance was unsatisfactory and grantee\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned includes: the program was initiated less than two\n            years after the Bonn agreement. The needs for capacity\n            building were poorly defined at the time.\n            Ministries/agencies/departments were understaffed,\n            under-budgeted with unclear mandates. Two elements of this\n            innovation stand out. First, contingent changes to civil\n            service regulations opened up the civil service to external\n            recruitment. Second, incentive pay for Lateral entry\n            Programs (LEPs) in line posts was introduced without adding\n            upward pressure on the overall civil service pay structure\n            as they were essentially civil servants 'on\n            contract'. Both these lessons are relevant for post\n            conflict institutional environments characterized by\n            collapsed administrations and severe fiscal constraints.\n            Afghan Expatriate Programs (AEPs) often worked close to\n            Ministers and professionalized offices of the Ministers\n            enabling them to better focus on decision making and\n            separate their ministerial functions from their\n            'political roles'."}, "docdt": "2011-05-05T00:00:00Z"}
