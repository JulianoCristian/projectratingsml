to train technicians and selected staff, to improve road\n            work planning and programming capacity and to rehabilitate\n            and upgrade important road sections. The project will\n            consist of the following components: (a) a three-year\n            training program for road maintenance staff; (b) a\n            two-and-a-half year technical assistance program for road\n            maintenance execution; (c) upgrading of the\n            Government's soils laboratory to strengthen its\n            participation in road maintenance activities; (d) design of\n            proper and systematic pavement maintenance and strengthening\n            programs; (e) strengthening and rehabilitation of about 200\n            km of primary paved roads; and (f) construction of the\n            Louga-Dahra road (about 85 km) to two-lane, paved standards."}, "docdt": "1980-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
