                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project continues to be implemented in a moderately satisfactory manner with some key results having been achieved. An Impact Evaluation in partnership with UNICEF and the
                         Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium shows that 13 million Long Lasting Insecticide-treated Nets (LLINs) were distributed, with a focus on North and South Kivu and Katanga. In
                         the household where these nets were distributed, the use of LLINs has doubled. Additionally, the proportion of anemia among children was reduced by five times after the intervention

                         and the prevalence of malaria among pregnant women was reduced by half at the household level. These results show that there is a significant improvement in the health status of
                         the population especially women and children after the distribution of the LLINs.

                         In terms of vaccination coverage, the impact evaluation shows that the 2013 target for DPT3 (Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus) has been reached. In the Project d’Appui de

                         Réhabilitation du Système de Santé (PARSS) zones, the coverage was 89% which was above the national average of 84%. For OPV3 (Oral Polio Vaccine), the coverage was 89% in
                         the PARSS Health Zones.

                         Additional indicators to note include the percentage of deliveries assisted by trained personnel that have increased from 47% at baseline (DHS-2007) to 80% as per the preliminary
                         results of the DHS-2013; the increase in the percentage of children 6-59 months who received vitamin A (twice a year) from 83% to 90% and the increase in the percentage of
                         pregnant women receiving antenatal care increased from 83 to 87%. Under five child mortality has decreased from 143 to 105 per 1,000 live births.

                         The scaling up of the performance based financing to the 84 Health zones is well underway and initial results after four months of purchasing services is being seen in terms of
                         increase of utilization as well as improvement of quality of care. In addition, in collaboration with Ministry of Health a PBF web-enabled application was created and is now functional,
                         and data entry for the first quarter 2014 is being processed, including baseline information from the 84 health zones from the last quarter of 2013.

                         While progress has been made on many of the indicators, efforts are still needed in terms of family planning where results are stagnant given the unavailability of commodities.
                         Malnutrition levels are also quite high and the DHS 2013 is showing almost no progress in terms of stunting which is at 43% (same as in 2007). Further efforts are needed over the
                         next months to help address some of these challenges as well as trying to increase vaccination coverage.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         At the request of Government, the project is being restructured for a proposed extension of six months to December 31, 2014. The activities that would be continued under the project
                         are PBF related activities, the Gender Based Violence activities and the activities supported by the Canadian Trust Fund which supports capacity strengthening in budget preparation
                         and execution. The extension of this project by six months would be expected to yield some lessons learned for the implementation of the new Health Systems Strengthening Project
                         and would assist in laying the ground work to have solid systems in place for the new project.

                         Restructuring History
