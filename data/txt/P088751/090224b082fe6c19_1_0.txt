A. Summary of Proposed Changes
The proposed restructuring paper for the Congo, Democratic Republic of, Health Sector
Rehabilitation Support Project (PARSS) (P088751) Grant No. H7500 - DRC intends to extend the
closing date of the project from June 30, 2014 to December 31, 2014. This current closing date
extension request is necessary as the Government expressed a strong desire to be given enough
time to complete their piloting of the Performance Based Financing (PBF) in the 84 health zones
covered by the project which after 6 months of implementation has already started to show good
results in terms of increased utilization and improvement of quality of care. An additional 6
months will also enable them to lay out the plans for a potential scale up to additional health
zones. It will enable the Government to pilot full alignment and harmonization of interventions
among key partners in the field such as UNICEF initially and Global Fund as well as Global
Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) who are keen to “piggy-back” on the Bank’s
PBF strategy to support health system strengthening. Ongoing dialogue with these partners
indicate that they would align their activities and funding to the 84 Health zones of the current


                                                 5
project as a pilot phase with a scale up to potentially 169 health zones in 2015-2018 as part of the
new WB-funded project. In addition, a new financing through the Multi-Donor Trust Fund for
Health Results Innovation in the amount of 10 million dollars will be finalized shortly in order to
finance this scale-up and alignment of activities. No other changes are introduced with this
restructuring.
.
B. Project Status
This project is implementing satisfactorily at present. Some of the results to date include
vaccination coverage for DPT3 (0-11 months) and OPV3 (0-11 months) in the PARSS zones of
89% which is above the national average of 84%.
After experiencing start-up and implementation delays, the project was restructured in April 2010.
The additional financings and the added mandates (malaria, polio, and vaccines) have required
extra time for proper implementation of the project. The third additional financing (AF) was
approved in July 2012 and launched in May 2013; through this AF, there has been a shift in the
focus of the project which is now using a Performance Based Financing strategy in the 84 health
zones in 5 provinces covered by the project. Since May 2013, significant progress has been made
in the project; essential drugs, family planning and nutrition inputs have been purchased and
recruitment of technical assistance at the health district levels has been completed. The project has
moved ahead with implementation and is yielding positive results in terms of increasing
utilization of health services as well improving quality of care. Such strategy is laying a good
foundation for the follow-on project which will be a full PBF project. The government requested
for the extension of the current project to give the PBF strategy time to yield further results on the
ground and support the development objectives of the project. The Government is also using this
strategy to align additional partners around the increase of utilization and the improvement of
quality of care. Hence, laying the ground for a potential scale up from 84 health zones to 169
health zones in collaboration with the UNICEF, Global Fund, GAVI and other partners. The
Bank, as part of its new project preparation is looking at expanding its target areas from the 84
health zones to 169 health zones for the period 2015-2018. Such expansion would be done in
collaboration with other development partners such as UNICEF, GAVI, and Global Fund.

C. Proposed Changes
.
Financing
Change in Loan Closing Date(s):
Explanation
This restructuring aims to extend the closing date from June 30, 2014 to December 31, 2014. The
reason for this extension is to continue implementing the PBF strategy for an additional 6 months
given the delays in startup and hence providing the Government sufficient time to see the results
of this pilot phase. Currently, there is available funding in 2 sub-components (Sexual and Gender
Based Violence and Mid-Term Expenditure Framework), and a co-financing of 10 million dollars
is made available by the HRITF Trust Fund. This funding will carry out the PBF activities for
PARSS over the next 6 months.

Reference to the Co-Financing:
Explanation
This restructuring aims also to mainstream and align a proposed grant of ten million dollars
extended to DRC by the Association under the Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Health Results
Innovation through a HRITF Grant Agreement to be signed on or before June 30, 2014. A new
dated covenant and definitions would therefore be added to the proposed amendment letter to
reflect this co-financing.
