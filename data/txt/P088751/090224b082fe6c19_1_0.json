The restructuring\n            paper for the Congo, Democratic Republic of, Health Sector\n            Rehabilitation Support Project (PARSS), DRC intends to\n            extend the closing date of the project from June 30, 2014 to\n            December 31, 2014. This current closing date extension\n            request is necessary as the Government expressed a strong\n            desire to be given enough time to complete their piloting of\n            the Performance Based Financing (PBF) in the 84 health zones\n            covered by the project which after 6 months of\n            implementation has already started to show good results in\n            terms of increased utilization and improvement of quality of\n            care.  An additional 6 months will also enable them to lay\n            out the plans for a potential scale up to additional health\n            zones. It will enable the Government to pilot full alignment\n            and harmonization of interventions among key partners in the\n            field such as UNICEF initially and Global Fund as well as\n            Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) who are\n            keen to \u2018piggy-back\u2019 on the Bank\u2019s PBF strategy to support\n            health system strengthening.  Ongoing dialogue with these\n            partners indicate that they would align their activities and\n            funding to the 84 health zones of the current project as a\n            pilot phase with a scale up to potentially 169 health zones\n            in 2015-2018 as part of the new WB-funded project. In\n            addition, a new financing through the Multi-Donor Trust Fund\n            for Health Results Innovation in the amount of 10 million\n            dollars will be finalized shortly in order to finance this\n            scale-up and alignment of activities. No other changes are\n            introduced with this restructuring."}, "docdt": "2014-05-14T00:37:00Z"}
