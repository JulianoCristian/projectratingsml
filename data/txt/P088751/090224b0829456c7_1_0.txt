Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The objective outlined in the Health Sector Rehabilitation and Support Project was to ensure the delivery of a quality health package in 84 health zones
 in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), while improving efficiency of the system in order to increase outcomes and outputs relative to investments.
 The Demographic and Health Survey (DHS-2014) revealed a mixed picture in achievement of health outcomes and outputs, with significant progress in
 reducing child mortality (30 percent reduction) and improving access to some services and commodities (e.g. insecticide-treated bed nets to prevent
 malaria), but stagnation with regards to fertility rates (increased from 6.3 to 6.6) and child chronic malnutrition (stagnant at 43% for over 10 years). The
 same survey also revealed widespread gender-based violence, well beyond the Eastern provinces where most of the support for survivors of sexual and
 gender based violence has been focused to date. The project has contributed to these achievements through its analytical work, technical assistance
 and financing which covers 84 health zones in 5 Provinces (Kinshasa, Equateur, Maniema, Bandundu and Katanga) or about 11 million people. The
 project was designed as the country was ending its civil war and hence, to strengthen the capacity of the health system, the Bank financed the
 rehabilitation and provision of equipment for 811 health facilities, purchase of essential drugs to address maternal and child health, trained 13,599
 health personnel. In addition, the project benefited from three additional financings: the first one focused on providing insecticide treated bed nets to
 prevent malaria, with 11.8 million such nets financed by the Bank. The second one focused on contributing to polio eradication. DRC has not had a
 case of polio reported in the last three years. In the last eighteen months, through its third additional financing, the Bank has shifted its strategy to scale
 up performance-based financing (PBF) which has been piloted in DRC for the past 10 years. PBF supports various levels of the health system (starting
 with the health facilities) in developing results-oriented action plans and making payments based on the results (quality and quantity) achieved. This
 approach will be the framework used for the envisaged new health system strengthening project which will cover 140 health zones, reaching
 approximately 25 percent of the population of DRC. The expanded reach is possible due to harmonization of financing with key partners, notably
 UNICEF, the Global Fund, and UNFPA. The same performance-based financing approach will also be used to provide a package of health services
 focused on women and young children in North and South Kivu provinces, as part of the Great Lakes Emergency Sexual and Gender Based Violence
 and Women’s Health Project. Overall the project achieved most of its intended results as 60% of the project indicators were achieved and for the
 remaining indicators net progress was noted from the baseline such as curative care which was at baseline .19 and at closing .39.

               Beneficiaries are more than the population targeted by the 84 health zones which is about 11 million people because under the Malaria and
               Polio additional financing, the bednet and polio interventions targeted additional provices which needed the support hence total
               beneficiaries is 25.5 million about.
