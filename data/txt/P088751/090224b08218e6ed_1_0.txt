                         All planned activities have been completed as planned. Some key results include: (i) 8.9 million Long Lasting Insecticide-treated Nets (LLINs) purchased and distributed in the
                         provinces of Katanga, North and South Kivu as part of the nationwide mass LLIN distribution campaign, and additional 2.5 million LLINS were distributed in Bandundu, and (ii) 25
                         million people immunized and no new cases of Polio documented in the Democratic Republic of Congo for the past year. For malaria, impact of the interventions on the beneficiaries

                         will be reported once the post- campaign survey is completed. For Polio, the National Vaccination Program is currently consolidating the results.

                         The Canadian Trust Fund supporting capacity strengthening in budget preparation and execution which was due to close on June 30, 2013 was extended to June 30, 2014 in order to
                         ensure that all planned activities are delivered.

                         The Katanga Result Based Financing Pilot was completed on June 30, 2013. The results of the Impact Evaluation were validated by the stakeholders in July 2013 and finally a
                         technical discussion took place in October 2013 to confirm the results and discuss the various experiences of the partners with Performance Based Financing in DRC. The new
                         project activities have been successfully launched in May 2013 and implementation is well underway with the key contracts (including those with Services Purchasing Agency, or
                         AAP) signed. Further effort is made to accelerate implementation given that the project now has less than 7 months of implementation (closing date June 30, 2014). With the new
                         focus on Performance based financing (PBF) , the following has been achieved: (i) in collaboration with Ministry of Health a PBF web-enabled application was created (http://cd.
                         thenewtechs.com/) which will function as the public front end and administrative backbone of the PBF program; (ii) a multi-agency workshop was held in Kinshasa 12-15 August to
                         get agreement on the PBF tools and institutional arrangements; (iii) a PBF user manual was created; (iv) a training of trainers was done in Kinshasa by an experienced master trainer;
                         (v) trainings at the provincial, district, health zone levels has started across five provinces, 84 health zones by the implementing partners GIZ, CCISD and Sofreco, in collaboration
                         with the PARSS implementation units and the MOH-RBF unit. In addition a Memorandum of Understanding was signed with UNFPA to deliver a series of activities related to Gender
                         Based Violence. Finally, additional essential drugs have been procured and distribution has started in some of the health zones. All activities are expected to be delivered by en of
                         June 2014. However, for the PBF activities to really show results it would have been preferable that implementation would be done over a yearâ€™s time rather than 6 months.
