Rehabilitation Support Project for Congo, Democratic\n            Republic of were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            many changes in indicators, including wording, targets and\n            completely new indicators added over the course of the\n            restructuring and AFs added much complexity to monitoring\n            and evaluating the project progress. Better documentation on\n            progress on these indicators and more realistic assessment\n            before changing targets would have simplified subsequent\n            assessments. The gender-based violence pilot in a\n            non-conflict region is a good example of making funds\n            available and contracting out a pilot in a theme-area that\n            was not recognized as an urgent issue. The pilot managed by\n            UNFPA was very successful and will be scaled up in the next\n            project. The PBF pilot is another example of how the\n            project, with leveraged funds, introduced a new approach to\n            financing the system. The pilot was evaluated and produced\n            results that confirmed that Results-Based Financing (RBF)\n            could work in DRC. Many of the lessons and findings of this\n            pilot are also included in the new health project, which\n            will scale up and implement the PBF approach nationally. The\n            project was started with the purpose to rebuild a\n            deteriorated health sector. The approach to rebuilding at\n            the time, in a very weak environment, was to focus on\n            getting the vertical service delivery functional again. In\n            the ten-year implementation period, the situation evolved\n            and the importance of not only rebuilding the basic services\n            at the local level but also the system itself, became\n            important. The project, with the help of the Trust Funds,\n            initiated some work on strengthening the health system, in\n            the areas of health financing and financing mechanisms, but\n            much more remains to be done. The project provides many\n            lessons to be taken on in the new operation."}, "docdt": "2015-10-25T23:39:01Z"}
