1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

In 2006 when the project was being prepared, the health sector system in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) was in serious disarray. There were significant gaps in service
delivery, health outcomes were at appalling levels, health system capacity was very week,
and the political situation was extremely fragile. In response, the World Bank designed
and launched the Health System Rehabilitation Support Project (Projet d’Appui à la
Réhabilitation du Secteur de la Sante - PARSS). While some aspects were underestimated
overall the design was appropriate. The many implementation challenges the project faced,
which are highlighted in this implementation completion report (ICR), were nevertheless
overcome through the sheer doggedness and commitment of the Government, the Bank
teams and especially the implementing partners and local health staff. The project fully
disbursed its resources which had more than doubled since inception. More importantly,
most project development objectives (PDO) indicators were achieved and in some cases
surpassed. The benefits of this project can be found in the results achieved as well as in the
lessons learned of what worked and what did not in a fragile post conflict country context.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1. In 2005, after a decade of political instability and conflict and many years of
mismanagement, the country was making considerable progress towards peace,
reconciliation, and economic recovery. A series of political and military agreements were
established towards political reconciliation and a Government of national unity was
appointed in June 2003 for a 24-30-month period leading to elections. Political progress
was accompanied by the reunification of the country. The high level of devastation was
reflected in the significant low GDP per capita of US$96 in 2002. With sufficient security,
economic activity slowly began to resume.

2. Although there were many encouraging developments, the overall situation
remained fragile, challenges ahead were daunting, and the social situation was acute.
There was still insecurity in parts of the country, especially in the East; the public debt was
at record high and fiscal resources very limited; institutions were in shambles and the
country was plagued with governance and fiduciary challenges; public finance
management had deteriorated and the administrative capacity of the country was
compromised. The majority of Congolese in 2005 lived on the equivalent of US$0.20 per
person per day. The social crisis was reflected by the collapse of social services delivery
and the erosion of social capital. Infrastructure suffered considerable damage, a key
impediment for a large country like DRC. A determining element moving forward was the
successful management of the period of political transition leading to elections.

3. DRC had very poor health outcomes. The country had among the highest levels of
infant, child, and maternal mortality in the world. One in 10 infants died before their first
year and at least one in five children died before reaching five years of age. The maternal
mortality ratio (MMR) was one of the highest in the world at 1,298 maternal deaths per
100,000 live births. In addition, there were an estimated 3.8 million “excess” deaths


                                              1
between 1998 and 2005 that were not due to the direct violence but to increased
malnutrition and disease stemming from the displacement and socioeconomic disruption
caused by the conflict. Diarrhea, respiratory infections, malnutrition and measles were the
main causes of child mortality. Malaria was the number one killer of children under five
and a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among adults. Ninety Seven percent of
the population was at risk of endemic malaria, with drug resistance emerging as a serious
concern. The prevalence of adult HIV/AIDS was estimated at 4-5 percent, indicating
epidemic levels, and a very large part of the population was at increased risk of the disease,
including displaced persons and the many rape victims. The prevalence of child
malnutrition (38 percent), particularly wasting (16 percent) was high. Overall, the majority
of Congolese consumed less than two-thirds of the daily calories needed to maintain good
health in 2005. The large population of 58.3 million was growing fast, at an estimated
annual growth of 2.9 percent. With its high fertility and mortality, 48 percent of the
population was under the age of 15. Modern contraceptive use was at 4 percent. Based on
the above, DRC was highly unlikely to achieve any of the health-related Millennium
Development Goals by 2015.

4. The health system had largely collapsed due to lack of funding and support. Even
though the total health budget had increased from one percent in 2002 to seven percent in
2004, it remained highly insufficient, serving mainly to make sporadic and very low salary
payments to Government health workers, which resulted in a lack of motivation and poor
performance. Health care expenditures per capita was very low at US$0.22 in 2002. Health
funds were irregular and only partially disbursed, budget execution at approximately 70
percent for salaries and 40 percent for recurrent expenditures. Moreover, public spending
for health was largely concentrated in the capital Kinshasa. Skilled health personnel were
lacking in numbers (1,500 doctors for the country) and quality deficient. When services
were available, utilization was poor due to high user fees. The majority of the population
paid most of their health costs directly out of pocket. Supplies of drugs were meager, and
inefficiently procured, the supply chain quite fragmented, and outreach and community
health centers were very weak. An estimated 70 percent of the population had no access to
health care at all, and hospitals and clinics, particularly in rural areas, had been devastated.
The capacity of the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) to carry out its stewardship and
oversight function was extremely limited.

5. Yet, opportunities for a positive change in health sector performance did exist.
First, the health zone (HZ) model, based on the decentralization and integration of primary
care and first-level referral services, remained the basis of the health system. Second, there
were strong public-private-partnerships with faith-based organizations (FBO) and
international non-governmental organization (NGO)-run facilities integrated in the zonal
health system.1 Finally, an increasingly results-focused culture at the MoPH was
developing allowing a transition from process- to performance-based contracting between
NGOs, health facilities, and health zone (HZ) management teams.



1
  Since the 1980s and in view of the collapse of the state, non-state actors, including faith-based organizations, had taken over the
delivery of essential health care services through partnership contracts in DRC.



                                                                 2
6. Given this context, the rationale for the Bank to engage in the rehabilitation of the
health sector in DRC was highly justified. The Government’s health strategy aimed to
provide a package of essential health services (EHS) at the primary care level, with a
particular emphasis on women and children, who were suffering the highest burden of
morbidity and mortality. The Government was also keen on strengthening its stewardship
role while devolving responsibility for the supervision and management of health activities
to the provincial and district levels. World Bank support was in line with the May 2004
Round Table for Health and consensus from donors2 to help rebuild the health system. A
clear cartography of donor support by areas and districts was developed by the MoPH’s
Planning Department covering specific HZs out of the 515 HZs comprising the health
system in DRC.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

7. The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to ensure that the target population of
selected health zones has access to, and use, a well-defined package of quality essential
health services.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
Indicators, and reasons/justification

8. The PDO was not changed. However, key performance indicators were revised to
reflect the recommendations from the March 2009 Mid-Term Review (MTR) and the focus
of the Additional Financings (AFs) that were approved in 2010, 2011, and 2012. During
the MTR, several indicators were determined to be too specific, insufficiently related to the
PDO or not measurable and were subsequently reworded or dropped (please see Annex 2
for all details). Also, the AFs introduced supplementary indicators related to the original
project activities and changed the targets of existing indicators, reflecting the scaling-up of
efforts. To that effect, new malaria and polio-specific indicators were introduced under AF-
I and AF-II, and relevant targets were adjusted in 2011 and 2012 at the time of the 3rd AF.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

9. The original project’s beneficiaries were meant to include an estimated 9.4 million
people living in the 83 (out of 515) selected HZs in the provinces of Equateur,
Katanga, Maniema, Bandundu, and Kinshasa. A special focus was on targeting women
as well as children under the age of five. In addition, the MoPH and the different levels of
the health system were expected to benefit from capacity building activities.

10. The number of project’s beneficiaries increased during the project lifespan. The
additional Financing (AF) expanded the geographical scope of the project. AF-I increased
malaria control interventions to cover the entire province of Katanga3 and two new
2
  Other donors (African Development Bank, Belgium, EU, USAID) supported DRC with humanitarian assistance in conflict-affected
areas and targeted provinces other than the Bank selected areas for enhancing the quality and accessibility of health care.
3
  The original project only covered two districts in the province of Katanga.



                                                             3
provinces, South and North Kivu, to carry out the mass long lasting insecticidal net (LLIN)
campaigns scheduled by the National Malaria Program (Programme National de Lutte
contre Malaria - PNLP). AFI reached over 20 million people in 153 HZs in these
provinces. AF-II supported the nationwide mass polio vaccination campaign and AF-III
expanded the delivery of the package of EHS to the original HZs and South and North
Kivu.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

11. The original US$150 million project had the following four components:

12. Component 1 - Expand Access to and Utilization of a Proven Package of Essential
Health Services to Selected Districts and Health Zones (US$104.0 million): This
component was to support the MoPH to provide a package of EHS4 in the targeted 83
selected HZs in the five selected provinces through the financing of work programs to be
implemented by international NGOs as implementing partners (IPs) under performance-
based partnership contracts (PPCs) by: (a) making the package of EHS available; (b)
improving usage of EHS in terms of costs by: reducing financial barriers to utilization;
particularly of maternal and child health services; improving financial management,
transparency, and accountability at the facility and HZ levels; creating the exemption
programs for the poorest; and eliminating the then much-used practice of “taxation” of
lower levels of the system by the intermediary levels; and in terms of quality of delivery
of service by enhancing the competency of health personnel; and (c) developing the health
system. This was to be achieved by (i) providing technical support and training to HZ
health management teams in the areas of program coordination, financial and personnel
management, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E), and improving the technical capacity
of frontline health workers, including Community Health Workers (CHWs) and health
facility personnel in the areas of the service packages to be offered under the project; and
(ii) enhancing the public-private partnership between the Recipient and private non-profit
service providers through PPCs.

13. Component 2 - Boost Malaria Control Interventions (US$30.0 million): This
component was to support the scaling-up of key malaria control interventions in the same
districts and HZs as under component 1, supporting the 2002-2006 National Roll Back
Malaria (RBM) Strategic Plan by (a) financing and distributing drugs (intermittent
preventive treatment –IPT- for pregnant women; artemisinin-based combination therapy -
ACT) and long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs); carrying out rapid diagnostic tests;
carrying out community communication strategies and training of health workers in the
HZs; and (b) carrying out operational research and providing technical assistance (TA) to
the MoPH and the IPs in the implementation of the malaria-related activities of the project.

4
  The package of EHS consisted of: (i) child preventive health interventions; (ii) reproductive and neonatal health services; (iii) integrated
management of childhood illnesses (IMCI); and (iv) community-level activities through community health workers (CHWs) (relais
communautaires).




                                                                      4
14. Component 3 - Strengthen Capacity for Oversight and Evidence-Based Management
of the Health System (US$12.0 million): This component included: (a) strengthening
MoPH’s stewardship and supervisory function and improving its capacity to carry out
M&E activities; (b) strengthening the capacity of the provincial medical inspector (PMI)
and the district medical inspector (DMI) in the fields of planning, coordination and
supervision, M&E, budgeting and financial management (FM) and personnel management
through the provision of goods, training, TA and operating costs at the district and
provincial levels and remuneration of said PMI and DMI; (b) strengthening the capacities
of the MoPH in the fields of public health budget preparation and execution and human
resources management by assisting in the development and execution of a national human
resource strategy; (c) supporting operational research to better inform strategic
interventions in the health sector; and (d) strengthening MoPH’s capacity to improve health
systems through training.

15. Component 4 - Project Coordination (US$4.0 million): This component was to ensure
project execution, coordination and supervision, including dissemination of results and
procurement and financial management and M&E activities associated with the project.

1.6 Revised Components

16. The original component design was not revised. However, the approval of the three
AFs increased the scope of activities within the components (see below for details) and
expanded the geographical coverage of the original project. Therefore, the total project
amount more than doubled from US$150 million to US$335 million (see Table 1 below).
In addition, two Health Results Innovation Trust Funds (HRITF) and a Canadian trust fund
(TF) were linked to the project and added additional resources for technical studies and
assistance. Their role in contributing toward the PDO is discussed in section 3.2 of the ICR.

17. The US$80 million AF-I, approved in December 2010, was prepared to support
DRC’s efforts to scale up malaria control interventions. AF-I increased (a) funding for
the activities under components 2, 3, and 4, with an emphasis on component 2, and (b) the
geographical scope of the Project’s malaria component to provide province-wide mass
distribution campaigns in the provinces of Katanga, South Kivu, and North Kivu in
addition to the original five provinces targeted by the original project.

18. To support DRC to respond to a severe polio epidemic, a US$30 million AF-II was
approved in June 2011. The AF-II was processed under OP/BP 8.0 Rapid Response to
Crises and Emergencies. It aimed at supporting DRC’s efforts to control and prevent the
recurrence of poliomyelitis outbreaks and to strengthen the routine vaccination program.
This AF scaled up (a) activities under component 1 covering immunization services as part
of the EHS, and (b) specific polio-related training and institutional strengthening under
component 3. Some funds were made available for operational costs under component 4.

19. A third AF, AF-III, in the amount of US$75 million, was approved in June 2012,
to continue support in providing a package of EHS at the primary level. The activities
fell under components 1, 3 and 4 to cover a scale up of the basic EHS interventions under


                                             5
component 1 with a focus on reproductive health, HIV/AIDS, immunization, and nutrition
services, and to build capacity at the provincial level for project implementation and at the
central level for the management of donor projects. AF-III also provided additional funding
for operational costs under component 4.

1.7 Other significant changes

20. The closing date of the project was extended four times for a total of 4.5 years.
Under the April 2010 restructuring, the closing date was extended by 18 months, from June
30, 2010 to December 31, 2011 to make up for start-up delays. In order to accommodate
the new activities under the first AF, a second 18-month extension of the closing date was
granted from December 31, 2011 to June 30, 2013. Furthermore, at the time of the approval
of the AF-III, the closing date of the AF-III was again extended until June 30, 2014. Finally,
a six-month extension until December 31, 2014 was granted to allow for the achievement
of the planned activities given the performance-based financing (PBF) scale up.

21. Key institutional and organizational changes occurred over the lifetime of the
project. They included: (i) the change in fiduciary responsibility from the state fiduciary
agency BCECO (Bureau Central de Coordination) housed in the Ministry of Finance
(MoF) to the project coordination unit (PCU) at MOPH; (ii) the change in the
responsibilities and level of autonomy of the IPs; (iii) the increasing responsibility of the
MoPH in managing the project; (iv) the increased reliance on UN agencies to procure and
implement some key activities: and (v) the change in approach from performance-based
contracting at the IP level to performance-based financing at the provider level.




                                                                 6
2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

22. The project was prepared in a participatory manner with the Government
strategy, policy and commitment deemed appropriate. The project was developed
following the May 2004 Round Table for health, the Government’s presentation of the
Minimum Partnership Program for Transition and Recovery in November 2004 as well as
the FY05 Bank’s Health Country Status Report. The project preparation also benefited
from coordination with and inputs by development partners.

23. Given the very challenging post-conflict context, the project was largely designed
around experience learned in the implementation of Bank operations in DRC5 as well
as in post-conflict countries. The project design included key lessons on the need for: (a)
a large role for NGOs in support to service delivery to overcome capacity constraints while
building the government capacity to coordinate and manage the sector as well as the
capacity of the front-line service provision system; (b) a strong PCU at the central level
and strengthened health authorities at the local level to effectively manage partnership
contracts and ensure MoPH’s ownership at all levels; (c) selected IPs to be provided with
flexibility to implement their work programs to the local circumstances based on
performance contracts with built-in incentives to shift focus from inputs to results; and
(d) effective and timely M&E of IP performance.

24. The components of the project were well selected. There was a strong focus of the
primary health care level based on the HZ model and support was provided to the delivery
of a minimum package of EHS for component 1, the focus on malaria control for
component 2 (since malaria was the largest burden of morbidity among women and
children), and the strengthening of the capacity of the health system for improved oversight
and evidence-based management as well as a component on project management were
appropriate.

25. The implementation arrangements for the project were justified given the weak
Government’s capacity and dysfunctional health sector. The main feature was the
outsourcing of the project implementers and the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and
fiduciary control functions. The division of responsibility was as follows: the MoPH was
responsible for the oversight and management of the project; an independent PCU, within
the MoPH Secretary General’s (SG) office, was in charge of coordination between the
MoPH and the service providers; and the following service providers: (a) the State
procurement agent, BCECO6, responsible for managing the fiduciary aspects of the project
since there was no existing good procurement capacity in the MoPH-PCU; (b) given the
vastness of the country, experienced NGOs as well as IPs contracted on a performance
basis (with financial bonuses) to implement the project activities at the district level; (c) an

5
  Especially the three- year implementation experience of the health component of the EMRRP project. The EMRRP health component
in the amount of US$44 million supported the implementation of the same essential package of health services in 67 health zones.
6
  BCECO was already responsible for WB financed projects (across sectors) to manage the fiduciary aspects of projects. It has overall
responsibility for approving procurement, authorizing payment and managing the special account.

independent external evaluation agency (EEA) was used to monitor and evaluate IPs’
activities; and (d) externally recruited financial auditing and procurement auditing firms
were used.

26. The risks were underestimated at the design stage and the readiness to implement
the project was overestimated. While the selection of HZs to be targeted under the project
was a result of a geographic mapping of donors done by the Government, the project ended
up taking on the most difficult and remote zones with some of the worst health indicators.
This was compounded by extremely difficult access to these zones and very limited
transportation means. In addition, the anticipated coordination between the different
executing and implementing actors was overly optimistic and risks were not thoroughly
assessed. The technical, fiduciary and managerial implementation seemed to have been
taken for granted based on past experience; no thorough assessment of the situation of the
ground seems to have been carried out; no in-depth assessment of the governance and
political economy challenges for project implementation was undertaken; and some key
sector risks (disseminated health facilities, low salaries, low motivation of health workers,
cost recovery issue, low demand for services) that may likely have affected the project
execution were only partly identified. Lastly, the Result Framework was incomplete with
the provision of the baseline and targets for utilization indicators left to the EEA once
recruited and procedural manuals for project execution were not finalized.

2.2 Implementation

27. The project was implemented in a very challenging political, security, capacity
and governance context and faced complex operational challenges over a period of
more than nine years which included 3 AFs, making it one of the largest and complex
projects in the DRC portfolio. The implementation period can be split into two separate
periods (pre- and post-restructuring), each representing and explaining key factors behind
implementation progress or lack of progress and changes made during the course of the life
of the project.

   A. From project approval until the April 2010 restructuring

28. The project became effective more than 8 months after approval. Effectiveness
was delayed from December 2005 to April 2006 due to the turbulent political climate in
the country in the wake of the first elections in 40 years and the inexperienced project
management. All conditions of effectiveness (establishment of a financial and accounting
system and selection of independent auditors) were met on February 28, 2006 but the
project could not be declared effective until the project was ratified and the legal opinion
issued.

29. The project experienced a very difficult and long start-up period. Project
implementation suffered from (a) the difficult political context of 2006 with the contested
July 2006 presidential election results and post elections violence which led to the
organization of new elections in October 2006, and (b) persistent problems related to
procurement and fiduciary management. The project relied on three major procurement


                                             8
items (contracts for the nine IPs to implement project activities, the EEA, and the PNLP)
which comprised the bulk of the project and were managed centrally due to the governance
challenges faced by the country. Consequently BCECO was overwhelmed with managing
numerous projects and ended up performing very poorly, especially in handling complex
procurement for the service providers, leading to long delays in procurement procedures,
serious procedural mishaps on several contracts and inability to complete some important
tenders essential to the project’s infrastructure (i.e. FM and internal auditor firm, external
procurement audit firm, and the TA firm/NGO to support the provincial and districts level).
The Bank also contributed to the delays, with long procedures for providing non-objections
for contracting the IPs, as overhead costs were considered very high. Finally, payments
cleared by IDA for purchases by the PCU and IPs were delayed by BCECO. As a
consequence, the implementation rating (IP rating) was downgraded to unsatisfactory
range.

30. Once the IP contracts were finalized, implementation at the local level started,
albeit still at a very slow pace. Over a year and a half after effectiveness, contracts for
seven out of the nine IPs were finally signed and implementation started in October 2007
through the establishment of field offices. By mid-2008, all the IPs had started their
activities, including planning, training health personnel, providing incentives (primes) to
health personnel, supporting health services through the distribution of inputs to health
facilities, and carrying out mass-campaigns.

31. The start-up period remained very slow due to (a) continued security challenges, (b)
loss of original IP staff due to the long delays in signing contracts and the subsequent need
to recruit new employees; (c) continued delays in initial procurement of equipment and
vehicles which constrained IPs’ operations; and (d) many problems with transporiont due
to very poor infrastructure and costly and dangerous travel by air and water. Bottlenecks
in project management and implementation continued to hamper project execution
throughout 2008. These were due to: (a) cumbersome approach for the management of IP
contracts. The contracts requirements were burdensome and bureaucratic requiring
centralized procurement of key inputs which slowed down the operations of the IPs and
led to serious delays in getting the needed inputs (drug, vehicles, etc.) to HZs. In addition,
the numerous IP activities which required non-objections by the PCU impacted the
autonomy and flexibility in planning, budgeting and procurement7 for IPs and impeded
their ability to supervise implementation; (b) unclear institutional arrangements between
the PCU and BCECO: the division of fiduciary responsibility was diffused, leading to
continued delays in procurement and reimbursement of IPs and complicating Government
oversight of IP contracts which ended up focusing on process rather than performance as
envisaged by the project design; (c) a PCU operating as a standalone unit: there was very
little coordination collaboration and accountability between the PCU and the ministry’s
Secretary General and technical units; (d) poor relations between the PCU and CREDES,

7
  Initially the IPs were responsible for the procurement of drugs and equipment. However, delays were incurred that were compounded
by the very limited availability of firms to offer the required inputs at the local level.




                                                                9
the EEA following the very long delay in signing the contract, the EEA immediately ran
into difficulties resulting in delays in carrying out the baseline survey due to
misunderstandings between the PCU and the Public Health Institute of the MoPH on an
issue of non-compliance with IDA procedures to procure goods and services for its own
needs. The baseline data was finally available mid-year and the end of project targets in
November 2008; (d) geographic inaccessibility and the difficult security situation in some
areas exacerbated the implementation challenges and delayed distribution of inputs.
Component 3, which focused on building capacity at the intermediary level and among
provincial and district medical inspectors, was also seriously delayed in contracting a firm.
Given the substantial delays and lack of reliable data to assess progress, the PDO and IP
ratings should not have been upgraded to moderately satisfactory in the June 2008
Implementation Status Report (ISR). These ratings were downgraded back to moderately
unsatisfactory in the two subsequent ISRs.

32. A Quality Assessment of the Lending Portfolio (QALP) was carried out in May
2008 as part of the Africa Portfolio Review of risky projects. The QALP January 2009
final report rated the project’s quality of design and implementation as unsatisfactory due
to a weak Results Framework poor quality, and an inadequate risk assessment of the,
Government’s support for the project, and implementation delays. The QALP determined
that the prospect of achieving the PDO was unlikely and recommended that the project be
restructured at the Mid-term Review to remove BCECO from the project, increase IPs’
autonomy and flexibility to manage their project activities; and revise the scope of the
essential health package.

33. The MTR highlighted many of the persistent problems plaguing the project. By
the time of the May 2009 MTR, only 28 percent of total project funds had been disbursed,
mostly from the UNICEF contract under component 2. The key problems included: (a)
limited governance capacity for project management; (b) weak appropriation of the project
objective at all levels of the health system; (c) PCU operating very much in parallel with
the MoPH and not much accountable to the ministry; (d) lack of clarity about
responsibilities between the PCU and IPs; (e) weak implementation and management
capacity at the central and local levels; and (f) an incomplete RF. The MTR recommended
to: (a) continue with the project design but strengthen capacity in management,
procurement, supervision, and M&E; (b) transfer fiduciary responsibility from BCECO to
the PCU; (c) revise the IP contracts to allow for a more performance-based focus; (d)
improve the specificity of indicators and targets; and (e) extend the closing date by 18
months from June 30, 2010, to December 31, 2011 to compensate for the long start-up
delays.

34. Project implementation improved substantially over the course of 2009. Factors
contributing to the improved performance included: (a) revised IP contracts with clarified
procurement plans and procedures between the PCU and IPs; (b) improved management
and implementation of the IP contracts; and (c) improved cooperation between PCU and
BCECO allowing key centrally procured inputs to be delivered to the project districts. Also,
while the contract with CREDES and the relationship between the PCU and CREDES
remained problematic, the division of responsibility for M&E for the project was clarified



                                             10
in order to rely on IPs for timely routine monitoring while a household survey would be
done by the CREDES to assess the overall performance of the project. Also, although the
consultancy firm (CEMUBAC) was in place for the support to district and provincial health
administration under Component 3, effective support had not yet started. The improvement
in implementation led to the upgrading of the PDO and IP ratings to marginally
satisfactory.

    B. From the April 2010 restructuring until the completion of the project
35. The April 2010 restructuring led to a significant improvement of project
performance. After the MTR and the QALP recommendations the project was
restructured. The entire process took more than 18 months due to the multiple complexities
and issues that needed discussions and decisions at various levels. With the project
restructuring, fiduciary management was transferred from BCECO to the PCU now that
the key contracts were finalized. This was accompanied by seconded staff from BCECO
with a mandate to continue to build capacity within the MoPH. The implementation
capacity of the PCU improved markedly. IP contracts were further revised to simplify
procurement and FM procedures and to clarify tasks, indicators and targets. Improved
communication between the PCU and the MoPH was confirmed by the introduction of
monthly review meetings chaired by the SG to strengthen the MoPH oversight. IPs
accelerated project activities and the capacity-strengthening activities in health
management at the provincial and district levels resulted in improved supervision and trust
at the local level. The data collection and timely reporting also improved and a common
template to facilitate the quarterly reporting of IPs was developed. However, disagreement
persisted on the facility and households surveys delaying their completion. Finally, the
constraints with the EEA contract were addressed with the replacement of the team leader
and revision of the terms of reference. Disbursements picked up, completion of large
contracts led to a significant acceleration of disbursements, and by the revised closing date
of December 2011, all funds from the original grant were disbursed and as result, the DO
and IP ratings were upgraded to the satisfactory range.

36. Three AFs were approved in a period of 18 months between December 2010 and
June 2012. These AFs were prepared at the request of the Government and responded to
clear and specific health and financing needs to support the overall health system in DRC.
AF-I was prepared to respond to a resource gap for the Government’s strategy of LLIN
coverage and mass campaigns as DRC was a key priority country under the Malaria
Booster Program; AF-II was prepared to respond to a wild poliovirus outbreak with a high
risk of reaching epidemic proportions not only in DRC but also in neighboring countries;
and AF-III was requested to continue support to primary health care services to avoid a
financing gap until new funding from development partners was made available. The
proposed activities under the AFs fell under the components of the original project and
were consistent with contributing to impacting on maternal and child morbidity and
mortality. They also continued to support training and development of institutional
capacity at central and provincial levels. AF-III activities rightly focused on reproductive
health/family planning (FP), nutrition, HIV/AIDs, and immunization. The AF instrument
reflected the Bank’s management preference at the time to prepare AF rather than add new
projects to the portfolio given the difficult country context.



                                             11
37. The first two AFs8 were approved in December 2010 and June 2011 and a third
one was in preparation for approval by end 2011. AF-I became effective in May 2011
after some delay to obtain Government ratification and AF-II became effective in October
2011. To remedy the start-up delays due to the pre-elections context, a US$5 million
project preparation advance was approved for AF-II to allow timely support to vaccination
campaigns. The new activities and geographical scope of interventions for the AFs
impacted heavily on the workload of all project implementers while their capacity was still
limited and necessitated the recruitment of additional PCU fiduciary staff. Key activities
under the two AFs were contracted to UN agencies.9 The November/December 2011
events, when elections led to civil strife, geographic inaccessibility as well as insecurity in
some target provinces contributed to delays in the distribution of bednets until April 2012.
After a slow start, implementation of AF-II went as planned due to support of the technical
leadership of the National Immunization Program, one of the best organized structures
under the MoPH, which had subunits in all the provinces.

38. Meanwhile, lack of funding between December 2011 and July 2012 impacted the
delivery of EHS. During the period between the final disbursement of the original project
funds and the approval of AF-III funds were depleted. Therefore, activities were limited to
the bare essentials. Salary top-ups or “primes” were not paid out to health facilities and the
delivery of drugs and equipment was delayed. AF-I and AF-II pre-financed activities to
maintain the minimum level of EHS. AF-I reallocated some of its funds toward financing
some of the activities under component 1; it was then restructured as a level 2 to ensure
retroactive financing of the activities to continue the delivery of the essential health
package. The delay in Board approval and effectiveness of AF-III was due to the political
situation, a countrywide six-month suspension of disbursement because of governance
issues that were beyond the control of the project, and delays in obtaining the legal opinion.
An anti-fraud anti-corruption plan with performance measures, verification mechanism and
clear responsibility for implementation was developed to strengthen governance
mechanisms and dialogue among partners as well as to improve FM, accounting and
procurement mechanisms and to ensure proactive disclosure of project related information.
AF-III became effective in November 2012.

39. With AF-III10, approved in June 2011, a full PBF approach for EHS delivery was
put in place and the role of the IPs changed from being the main implementers to that
of capacity builders and results verifiers. Over time, as the capacity of the MoPH
province- and district-level staff grew, MoPH decided that staff was ready to take on
responsibility for complete implementation. Other considerations in the move to MoPH
implementation were the significant overhead cost of contracting IPs and the time-
consuming procurement process. Additionally, some of the IPs indicated that they had no
interest in continuing to support the project. As a result, implementation arrangements



8
  The closing date of the project was extended from December 31, 2011 to June 30, 2013.
9
  UNICEF was contracted to purchase, distribute, monitor, and report on the ITNs and to carry out the mass campaigns. AF-II financed
temporary staff for mass vaccination and social mobilization activities through a contract with UNICEF. WHO was contracted to provide
technical expertise and played an important role in reporting and disease surveillance through its network of provincial officers.
10
   A final extension of the closing date to December 31, 2014 to make up for previous delays was granted.



                                                                12
shifted: provincial-level PCUs were established11 to take over the role of the IPs in
contracting suppliers and paying incentives (primes) in the HZs and work with the district
health administrations. With the transfer of responsibility for implementation to the local
MoPH affiliates, the role of the remaining IPs diminished and evolved from service
providers to performance purchasing agencies, responsible only for verification of services
provided and results.

40. After a delayed launch of AF-III, steady progress was made in implementing the
PBF scale up12 to all the HZs. The effective launch of AF-III took six months and delays
occurred with the signature of key contracts pertaining to the implementation of EHS at
HZ levels. By end 2013, significant progress were achieved on all key contracts (purchase
of essential drugs, inputs for FP and nutrition, recruitment of TA firm to be deployed at
district levels, new EAA, Memorandum of Understanding with UNFPA). UNFPA was
contracted to conduct a number of gender-based violence (GBV) interventions and to
purchase FP commodities. After a long delay due to contract disagreements with the Bank,
UNFPA purchased the commodities, however, distribution was not clearly defined in the
contract and the commodities remained in customs at the time of the closing of the project
in December 2014. UNICEF implemented micro-nutrition interventions. Since the signing
of the two performance purchasing agencies contracts, the implementation of the PBF
program progressed steadily and PBF contracts were signed with the health facilities. Other
project activities were implemented once needs assessments for nutrition inputs, family
planning activities, ARV, and the strengthening of regional drug distribution centers were
finalized. Data on new indicators for AF-I and AF-II was not available caused by the delay
in launching and delivering the Demographic Household Survey (DHS) as well as the
UNICEF impact evaluation on bednet distribution. A final extension of the closing date
was granted on July 24, 2014, with a new Closing Date of December 31, 2014 to make up
for previous delays.

41. Despite the very difficult beginning and constraints during the initial project
implementation, after restructuring, the project ended up being fully disbursed and all
planned activities were implemented.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and
Utilization

42. Design: Key indicators were identified to measure improvement in geographical
access, reduction of financial barriers to utilization and enhancement of quality of care.
The decision to rely on an EEA was the right choice at a time when the MoPH’s capacity
to monitor and evaluate was very weak. The causal links, or results chain, between the
project’s inputs, activities, outputs, and intended outcomes seemed reasonable. Baseline,
MTR, and end-line surveys were planned accordingly. However, while the PDO clearly

11
   Each provincial-level PCU comprised a field coordinator with as small administration team while recruiting two NGOs/IPs as service
purchasing agent regrouping the 10 districts into two pools, the West and the East regions. Eight field coordinators were recruited. Many
of the former IP staff were recruited as individual consultants to manage the provincial-level PCUs.
12
   An RBF pilot in Haud Katanga was introduced in 2009. The RBF approach was not new for DRC, as many RBF schemes had been
taking place at the country level since 1996 and the EU project implemented an RBF approach in their selected health zones. The IE of
the RBF pilot informed the design of the PBF scheme.



                                                                  13
stated two main areas of achievement, access to and utilization of quality services, and
although several of the intermediate indicators measure access, few PDO indicators
directly measured improved access to services although there are a number of intermediate
outcome indicators which measure access. The assisted deliveries were likely intended to
be the access indicator at appraisal (percent of women who receive delivery care from a
trained provider), however, it was reworded to “percent of assisted deliveries” during
project restructuring and became a better indicator for quality of services and utilization
rather than access. The many changes in indicators and targets over the course of the
restructuring and AFs added much complexity to monitoring and evaluating project
progress. The project also comprised a component to help strengthen the capacity of
Government officials at all levels in planning, monitoring and evidence-based management
and included intermediate indicators to measure progress.

43. Implementation: The baseline data for the project only became available at the MTR
due to the long delays in contracting the EEA. The quality of the data was questionable and
often resulted in disagreements between the EEA and IPs on achievements. Project
management relied on the EEA’s reports but also used project data, the HMIS, and other
studies and reports conducted by partner organizations. Collaborative efforts by the donor
partners to finance a DHS around the end of project implementation were made despite
delays in the launch of the DHS as planned in 2012. Data were collected in 2013 and results
made available in October 2014. Other key studies were delayed (UNICEF impact
evaluation report, EEA household survey and final evaluation reports on malaria activities.
These delays resulted in a lack of reporting on impacts until quite some time after the
original project activities had been implemented. Over time, more responsibility for project
data collection was given to the IPs, especially after the restructuring, this improved the
timeliness and quality of the data reporting. Despite continuing management issues
between the PCU and EEA, the work was evaluated by CREDES during supervisions and
determined to be of satisfactory quality, and it provided reliable data that was later
confirmed by findings from the 2014 DHS.

44. A significant number of indicators were revised at the MTR to accommodate the
added focus and targets were adjusted to more ambitious levels. Additionally, a large
number of intermediate indicators were dropped from the initial list (please see Annex 2
for details). The link between the PDO and the PDO indicators after all the changes during
the AFs and restructuring could have benefited from more careful revision and better
consideration for more realism with regards to ambitious targets. Despite that, the majority
of indicators met or exceeded targets although 3 intermediate outcome indicators had no
reporting and therefore cannot be evaluated by this ICR.

45. Utilization: During the first years of implementation, the delays in obtaining
monitoring data did not inform or influence decision making and/or adjustment. However,
reporting from the IPs and project data were used extensively in the yearly health forums,
which were designed to take actionable decisions with regard to project activities based on
evidence from the field. At the same time, the AF-I was the result of data analysis and a
demonstration of the impact of the interventions. Studies by the Kinshasa School of Public
Health with UNICEF and WHO demonstrated that the malaria control interventions were



                                            14
having very positive impact, resulting in a decision to very rapidly scale up the malaria
interventions.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

46. Social and environmental safeguards: There were no reported social or safeguard
issues during the implementation of the project, and the rating has been consistently
satisfactory. The original project and the subsequent AFs were classified B (partial
assessment). The environmental issue related to the safe handling and disposal of medical
waste was generated from the minimum rehabilitation of the health facilities. These were
addressed in the Medical Waste Management National Plan (MWMNP) (Report E844-
December 2003), which was prepared in the context of the Bank-funded HIV/AIDS
project. The MWMNP was made available at public sites accessible to all project-affected
facilities and communities. In May 2011, a comprehensive environmental audit was
conducted and concluded that the environmental impact of the renovation of the health
facilities conducted under the project was minor. A higher risk was posed to the
environment from the placement of equipment such as waste-burning plants and latrines.
The report made recommendations on reducing those risks, such as taking into account
wind direction, other construction, and other types of medical waste disposal.

47. Indigenous people safeguard (OP 4.10): The safeguard was triggered by the AF-I in
recognition that though the Batwa people (indigenous pygmy population) are located in the
targeted HZs, the Strategy Framework for the Indigenous People Development Programs,
supported by the World Bank and the DRC Government, started only in 2009. Therefore,
terms of reference (TORs) for an Indigenous People Planning Framework (IPPF) were
prepared and its financing included under the AF-I. The IPPF was prepared and disclosed
in December 2, 2010 and September 22, 2011. In 2011, an indigenous people audit was
carried out and found that project activities had had a positive impact on the indigenous
people. No negative effects were reported. Access to health services increased from 40 to
65 percent in the areas where indigenous people reside. Moreover, prenatal care, hospital
care, and malaria control all saw improvements.

48. Procurement performance: Overall procurement performance was poor. Although the
decision to contract BCECO as the fiduciary agent at the time of preparation was the right
one, early on during implementation it became clear that the arrangement was not working
as expected. BCECO, the fiduciary agency for numerous other projects, did not have
adequate time for PARSS. The problems in procurement led to an almost two-year start-
up delay, and major disruptions in implementation due to procurement-related delays
continued during project implementation. The reasons for the poor performance were
discussed above. Unfortunately, given the challenging political economy and governance
context in DRC, the procurement management changes made no substantial difference in
the end, as the official in charge at BCECO during the first years of the project was
seconded from BCECO to the PCU. Later, when the BCECO contract ended and its
oversight role was terminated, the same person was hired by the PCU to lead procurement.
At various times, the quality and performance of the procurement process were
unsatisfactory.


                                           15
49. Financial Management: At the closure of the original project and after the first two
AFs, an in-depth financial management review took place, US$471,093.38 in ineligible
expenses were identified at the time of the audit, while the financial management
supervision mission identified another US$117,371.75 due largely to further review of the
reports. After an in-depth review, the total amount was found to be closer to US$150,000,
which was communicated and paid back by Government to the Bank. One important lesson
that emerged from this issue was the need for more regular and frequent supervision
reviews. Although during most of the project’s life financial management was rated
moderately satisfactory, during the last supervision mission, the project team downgraded
the rating to moderately unsatisfactory. This was due to a US$6 million financing gap13 at
closing that resulted mostly from the project’s over-commitment in the procurement of
essential drugs and its underestimation of the cost of their distribution. Project management
has not been efficient in administering the logistics of drugs, and issues have persisted up
until the time of the writing of this ICR.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

50. Continuing services and avoiding interruptions in the provision of health services
to the population in DRC has been at the forefront of project management concerns.
This resulted in the AF-III and the new health system strengthening project approved
by the Bank on December 18, 2014. In its last six months of implementation, the project
financed preparatory activities and used funds to avoid serious disruptions until the next
operation is effective.

51. Based on lessons learned from the project in terms of scope, implementation
arrangements, fiduciary practices, and interventions, three new operations have been
prepared and approved in order to assist the country in sustaining reforms and
institutional capacity: (i) the US$220 million Health Systems Strengthening for Better
Maternal and Child Health Outcomes (PDSS) approved on December 18, 2014 scales up
the geographical coverage of the project to include an additional 60 HZs in the provinces
of Equateur, Bandundu, and Katanga. Increased attention is being given to building
MoPH’s capacity in line with the ministry’s increased level of responsibility in managing
the health services. The PDSS is being implemented within the MoPH ensuring in-country
system use and capacity building. The PDSS also offers a platform for technical and
financial partner alignment14; (ii) the US$107 million Great Lakes Emergency Sexual and
Gender-Based Violence and Women’s Health Project (of which US$73.86 million is
allocated for DRC), approved by the Bank on June 26, 2014, aims to provide integrated
health and counseling services, legal aid, and economic opportunities to survivors of sexual
and gender-based violence and to strengthen health services for poor and vulnerable
women in Africa’s Great Lakes Region. It is the first World Bank project in the Africa
region with a major focus on addressing the needs of survivors of sexual and gender-based
violence; and (iii) the US$15 million Human Development Systems Strengthening Project

13
  It was agreed that the financing gap be financed under the new project.
14
  A Memorandum of Understanding was signed with the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), the Global Fund,
and UNICEF to ensure complementarity between the key strategic partners, which will continue to provide the inputs required while
the PDSS finances the outputs.



                                                               16
(P145965) approved on April 23, 2014. Includes a component on improving the HMIS and
strengthening the pharmaceutical sector, particularly FEDECAMES.

52. The project objectives were Highly relevant and fully consistent with the
Government and Bank’s strategic approaches for the health sector at the time of its
preparation. The PDO was aligned with the objective of the May 2002 Interim Poverty
Reduction Strategy, to enable the poor to have access to primary health care and the
Government’s strategy (Minimum Partnership Program for Transition and Recovery) to
increase access to the package of essential primary and first referral health services as well
as the National Roll Back Malaria Strategic Plan for the 2002-2006 period. Social
development was one of the strategic elements of the Bank’s 2004 Transitional Support
Strategy (TSS) which emphasized recommended additional resources for health activities
through both advisory and investment operations. The project objective was also highly
relevant to the Bank’s HNP strategy, its malaria booster strategy and the Africa HNP
strategic priorities.

53. The project objectives remained Highly relevant throughout the project life.
Despite considerable improvements over the past decade, as witnessed by a significant
decline in child mortality rates, overall health outcomes in DRC remain among the worst
in the world. The PDO remained fully relevant to the 2011-2015 National Health
Development Plan which identified as a key pillar the support to the development of the
HZs to deliver basic health services. Pillar three of the 2006 Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper on improving access to social services and reducing vulnerability and the Strategic
element 3 of the FY08-11 country assistance strategy (CAS) intended to help improve the
provision of social services and reduce vulnerability. The FY10-16 CAS also recognizes
the continued need for high-impact support in the health sector.

54. The relevance of the project development objective is rated as High, both before and
after restructuring and the three AFs.

Relevance of Design and Implementation

55. The relevance of the project design was and remained consistent with the project
objectives and with the needs of the country. The design was based on available
knowledge of the key causes of morbidity and mortality in the country (i.e. Bank Country
Health Status Report, 2002-2006 National Roll Back Malaria Strategic Plan). Analysis of
the health situation clearly highlighted the high burden of morbidity and mortality from
preventable and treatable diseases at primary and first referral levels. Therefore, the focus
on basic health services was highly appropriate. In addition, the emphasis on decentralized
service delivery through HZs with well-defined structures and faith-based organizations


                                             17
and NGOs as key IPs was very relevant given the decentralization approach of the
Government and the limited capacity of the Government. Given the precarious state of
child and maternal health in DRC, the EHS package, which included an integrated set of
maternal and child health services, was deemed sound and consistent with international
practices and targeted the most pressing health problems. It was also already utilized in
several HZs supported by donors. The provision of the EHS package, with the additional
services added over the ensuing years, remains the most important basic health service in
line with the burden of disease in DRC. Malaria control, included then as a specific
component because it was the largest burden of morbidity among women and children,
continues today the highest burden of disease and contributor to mortality. The project
activities were highly relevant and responded to the objectives of the project. The project
opted for the recruitment of an EEA and ensured that the project coordination component
had adequate funding for M&E due to the inability in DRC to obtain and analyze reliable
data in a timely manner. Last, the choice of target HZs was well coordinated and the project
supported the most deprived districts with no adequate support from other donors.

56. While the project design was responsive to the country context, some elements of
it could have been further assessed. At the time of project preparation, the health system
had all but collapsed, and what was remained was there due largely to community-based
and religious organizations. Therefore, the reliance on third-party implementers for service
delivery at the community level and for logistical support was the right decision. At the
same time, given that this was an ambitious project targeted at the country’s most
challenging regions in a very difficult environment, a more comprehensive capacity
assessment to allow for more effective capacity building at all levels should have been
conducted at the outset. Also, a more comprehensive performance assessment of the IPs
should have been conducted, as IP performance in practice was variable, not least because
the HZs were selected in some of the most challenging regions in the country. Also, while
the first two AFs responded to clear needs, they overloaded the PCU as well as IPs adding
complexity to an already challenging project implementation. Although AF-III was
prepared in response to clear demand from the Government, it could be argued that this
should have been a new project rather than a bridging of financing and capacity gaps for
many ongoing interventions until a new heath project was prepared. The AF instrument
reflected the Bank’s management preference at the time to prepare AFs rather than add
new projects to the portfolio.

57. Introducing Performance Based Financing (PBF) as an output strategy vs. an
input to ensure results. This decision was based on the positive results achieved in the
African region where PBF was introduced as a strategy to motivate and strengthen the
delivery of health services, and given the results in the neighboring countries. While not
all the intended results were achieved due to some design and some implementation issues
in a PBF pilot15 conducted and evaluated in DRC, it was deemed the right approach given
the need to empower the HZ to better achieve results and be able to deliver the EHS in a


15
  Between 2009 and 2013, in line with the Government health sector strategy of promoting contractual
approaches, a trust-funded PBF pilot was implemented in Haut-Katanga. An impact evaluation was
conducted and lessons learned documented.


                                                18
quality manner. Lessons learned from that pilot as well as from other country
implementation led to the introduction of PBF in all 83 HZ in 2013.

58. The Bank’s implementation assistance was largely responsive to the changing
needs and the operation remained important to achieving the country’s objectives.
Although the project was prepared in what was officially a post-conflict situation, security
issues remained in certain areas, and regular election-related and other violence continued
during the life of the project and contributed to delays and changes in government. The
reliance and close integration of local private non-profit service providers (faith-based
organizations), partners (IPs) and UN agencies to provide services and to build capacity,
especially at intermediate level (districts and provinces) and to front line service providers,
and the establishment of performance-based contract between the IPs and public and
private service providers at the decentralized levels in the early years were in line with the
prevailing weak capacity of the MoPH. The Bank also relied on donor partners to undertake
capacity building of the MoPH. At the time, given the demonstrated capacity of the NGOs
in DRC, it was a sensible decision to contract them to implement health services. In fact at
the time the only health services still being provided in the project selected areas were by
Faith Based Organizations (FBO). Using NGOs/FBOs proved to be a key factor in ensuring
that the interventions by in large continued during the political crisis. To date, FBOs
manage over 35 percent of all HZs in DRC.16 This led to increased government
responsibility in the later years of the project with the move to the PBF approach. Also, the
coordination of the project was reinforced and particular attention was paid to
strengthening donor planning and coordination at the district level throughout the project.
The risk rating at the design stage was high due to the potential recurrence of conflict and
continued weaknesses in governance and fiscal management. The risk was and continued
to remain significant at times it turned out to be high since security was an issue in some
regions and uncertainties during the election period were substantial. Despite major
political upheavals disruption and delays, the project fully disbursed.

59. The relevance of the project design and implementation is rated as Substantial both
before and after restructuring and after the three AFs.

60. Given the High relevance of objectives and Substantial relevance of design, the overall
relevance of the project is rated as Substantial.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

61. Overall efficacy is rated as Substantial. This is being assessed against the two main
objectives of improving utilization and access. The achievement of utilization
improvements is measured as the percentage of women and children sleeping under bed
nets and the share of women receiving IPT for which the expected targets were
overachieved. The fourth indicator of utilization, new cases of polio, was also overachieved
as no new cases of polio were reported since the interventions were started. The malaria
control and polio interventions in particular were highly successful, thanks to the scaling-

up of a recognized effective approach to malaria control and contracting UNICEF for
implementation. An evaluation by the Kinshasa School of Public Health on the impact of
the successfully implemented malaria activities under the PARSS demonstrated an increase
in ownership and utilization of ITNs and a concomitant reduction in fever episodes. Studies
carried out in 2013 demonstrated a reduction in morbidity and mortality from reduced
malaria fevers among the targeted population (UNICEF 2013). The evaluation also
confirmed the success of the LLIN campaigns in obtaining rapid results, leading to the
Government’s request to expand activities to the provinces of Katanga and South and North
Kivu to support its aim of universal LLIN coverage. Thanks to the project, over 11 million
LLINs were distributed to millions of households, and more than half of all women and
children under five in the targeted areas now sleep under bed nets.

62. Another key indicator of utilization is the annual curative consultation rate which
was partially met. This assessment needs some nuancing as it was close to its target at the
end of the implementation period of the original project. The last additional financing
adjusted the target upward, however its effectiveness was delayed and as explained in the
implementation section, utilization rates suffered. Utilization rates almost doubled between
2007 and 2011 (the original closing date) from 0.19 to 0.37 visits per person per year, due
to price-setting reforms and increased public resources for the health sector in project areas.
The final target was increased to 0.45 per person per year with the AF-III; it took a long
time for AF-III to become effective, however, which resulted in a financing dip and a
subsequent reduction in the utilization rate to 0.37 in 2014. Overall, the achievement
against the revised target is considered as partially achieved.

63. A similar phenomenon as explained for the utilization rates indicator occurred
with the family planning rates, which had increased from 2 to 6 percent by 2011, but
was not achieved at the end of the project when the rate dipped back to 2 percent. The
non-availability of funding led to a dip in the availability of contraception commodities.
Family planning is the only indicator the project did not achieve, even though the targets
were already set very low. Achieving improvements in family planning is very difficult, if
not impossible, if health facilities do not have the contraceptives in stock and suffer from
frequent stock-outs in supply. The very slow start up and continued procurement and
distribution problems with FP commodities hampered the family planning component
throughout the entire period of project implementation. Even in the closing month of the
project, the FP commodities had been sitting for over 9 months in the port of Kinshasa, due
to customs issues and lack of clarity about responsibilities and transport costs.

64.      The immunization indicators, that is, children 0–11 months vaccinated
against diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DPT) and the percent of children 12-23
months immunized against the oral poliovirus, were achieved on target. These
indicators and assisted deliveries, are good proxies for improved access, the second part of
the DPO. Assisted deliveries increased significantly but fell just short of achieving their
target in the PARSS provinces. Disaggregating the results to the provincial level, however,
shows that the most challenging provinces in term of access (Equateur, Bandundu, and
Maniema) all saw very important increases (except for Katanga) in assisted deliveries:
from 51 percent in 2007 to 64 percent in 2014 in Equateur, from 70 to 83 percent in


                                              20
Bandundu, and from 69 to 87 percent in Maniema. These are direct achievements of the
project interventions.

65.     The improvement of access is measured as increased availability of the EHS
package through the construction of new facilities and training of health staff. During
the project period, 818 health centers were constructed and over 13,640 health personnel
was trained in the project areas. In particular, from an equality perspective access
improved: the geographic selection of the most challenging regions with the lowest health
outcomes provides the project with very high marks on equity. In addition, health services
are now being provided where before the project started there were no services nor plans
by government to establish new services. The project (i) contributed to the management,
administration, and supervision capacity of the MOPH at the provincial and district levels,
including improvements in infrastructure and equipment; (ii) improved and assured the
availability of essential drugs and medication, including malaria control medication at the
health facilities in the targeted 153 health zones covering about 20 million people (about
11 million benefited in the 83 health zones where the essential package was delivered but
20 million were covered by the malaria control activities); (iii) provided logistical support
to health facilities in the targeted zones (vehicles, motorbikes, and ambulances); (iv)
improved working conditions by assuring better payments through bonuses (primes) to
health workers; (v) assured free distribution of LLINs; and (vi) financed research support,
especially in the area of health financing. Millions of households have received free ITNs,
immunization campaigns were successfully conducted, and awareness among the
population has been raised. Annex 2 lists the different component activities that were
financed by the project and the additional financings.

66.     Financial barriers to access of services were removed with the increased
resource availability, creation of the exemption program for the poorest and financial
incentives packages for health staff, as well as increased accountability at the health
facility level. The share of out of pocket expenditures of total health expenditures
decreased to 40 percent between 2005 and 2013 (see Annex 3: Economic Analysis).

67. A number of indicators could not be verified for lack of data and are therefore
not evaluable (see Table 3 below). Whether children received micronutrients is unclear
as there is no data to verify this. The indicator on micro-nutrients was added only with the
last AF-III; thus there is no baseline, or end-line data. Three other interim indicators,
including reporting on malaria control, training of health staff in health zones and number
of health staff trained in management and fiduciary responsibilities, lack data to report
achievements. The latter three however, are interim indicators for which other indicators
provide a reasonable proxy such as for example the number of trained health people overall
in the PARSS project represents those in PARSS zones.

68. As Table 3 below shows, the project has achieved the majority of the indicator targets
which can be measured. Even if the three non-evaluable indicators are counted, the overall
achievement is close to 80% for both PDO and IO indicators.

69. With regards to overall trends in health outcomes17 the most recent DHS data
shows significant declines in infant and child mortality in DRC overall. Although it is
difficult to attribute this directly to the project, the project’s contribution to preventing
malaria among children under five, the biggest killer of children in this age bracket, cannot
be understated. In two of the most inaccessible PARSS provinces, Bandundu and Maniema,
the decrease in infant and child mortality at 45 and 52 percent, respectively, was more than
the national average decrease of 37 percent between 2007 and 2014 (table 4). Given the
remoteness of these regions, and the fact that PARSS was the only project in those regions,
this was a significant achievement for the project. Other indicators such as assisted
deliveries also confirm strong results in PARSS areas (Table 4).

3.3 Efficiency

70. The economic justification of the original project and the subsequent AFs was
very clear. In 2005, after years of conflict, economic crisis, and mismanagement, DRC
needed an injection of resources into the severely underfunded health sector. At the time,
the burden of financing the health sector was largely borne by households in a country

Strategy as well as HNP Africa strategy.

classified as one of the poorest in the world. Keeping in mind the limitations, the economic
analysis conducted for this ICR (Annex 3) demonstrates that, using the most plausible
parameters, the project is likely to have generated positive returns for the Congolese
people. In fact, if the DALYs are valued at the recommended rate of three times the per
capita income, the estimates indicate that the project provided value for money throughout
the entire range of the 95 percent uncertainty interval, even when increasing the discount
rate to 5 percent. Project resources were used for strategic development, following national
priorities and country partnership goals, as well as increased equity by investing in the most
vulnerable areas. Additional Financing I and II had very strong economic rationales,
malaria being the highest burden disease at the time and a polio outbreak would have put
the entire region at risk.

71. Financial access to health services, through better financial protection, has
improved. According to WHO, a more than 40 percent reduction in the share of out-of-
pocket expenditure18 was observed in the country’s total health expenditure between 2005
and 2013, from approximately 57 to 33 percent. The decline in out-of-pocket expenditure
is most likely explained by an increase in both external financing and public expenditure.
The reduction of some of the user fees may have also contributed to this trend. Whatever
the main cause, the data suggest that individuals are using less of their own money to pay
for care and that out-of-pocket expenditure is no longer the main source of health financing
in DRC. The forthcoming World Bank PER shows an increase in public funding for health
from US$1.9 per capita in 2008 to US$2.8 per capita in 2013. However, an analysis of
public health expenditures as a percentage of GDP shows that there was a decrease from
4.6 percent in 2008 to 4.5 percent in 2013. The contribution from external financing
increased from 33.5 percent of the total health budget in 2008 to 37 percent in 2013.

72. Allocative efficiency is substantial. Using a combination of project data and
international data in its assumptions, the economic analysis shows a cost-benefit return of
3 dollars to each dollar invested by the project. The analysis only uses the improvements -
averted deaths and disability- from the increases in skilled deliveries, children and pregnant
women sleeping under bed-nets and children vaccinated with DPT3 (for which evidence is
available in the international literature), thus even this impressive return is likely
underestimated. Even the most conservative estimate, the lower bound shows an estimated
return of almost half a billion on the USD 332 million investment (for details see Economic
Analysis Annex 3).

73. In terms of technical efficiency, the project used the resources to maximize health
outcomes in the most cost-efficient manner with regards to activities. The high cost
effectiveness of the distribution of LLINs, the mass immunizations, and the distribution of
vitamin A has been demonstrated in numerous international studies.19 Implementation
efficiency improved during the project period. At the start the project applied the most

18
   The project contributed to a reduction in out-of-pocket payments by subsidizing an essential health package, thereby reducing
consultation and other fees at health facilities through price-setting policies and performance payments. A small survey by one of the
IPs, CCISD, demonstrated a reduction in the costs of services, prenatal care, facility-based deliveries, and consultations by half in the
district of Mbandaka. Health facility staff explained that they could reduce prices thanks to the performance bonus they obtained and
the increase in utilization (economies of scale).

efficient implementation arrangements by contracting to experienced entities and those that
had proven successful in health service delivery. Progressively, after capacity building, the
more sustainable approach of implementing using national health system structures, was
utilized with the local health sector authority taking increasing responsibility for service
delivery. Toward the end of the project, after piloting the approach, RBF was applied to
service delivery at the facility level. Although RBF has proven to be an efficient approach
in other countries, the pilot in DRC was not convincing due to the many changes in design
(see lessons learned). The AFs applied the most efficient approaches, based on the
interventional evidence, with provision of impregnated bed-nets and mass-immunization
against polio.

74. The lack of actual costing data does not allow for a cost-efficiency analysis.

75. In terms of implementation efficiency, delays were significant and as described in the
earlier sections, very disruptive throughout the entire period. Efficiency of the AFI and II
were substantial, although the efficiency of the original project and AFIII, together making
up two-thirds of disbursement, was modest. Due to the delays throughout the project
implementation, activities on the ground, even though relevant took much more effort
rendering them only modestly efficient and significantly reduced the capacity building
opportunities, and subsequently reducing sustainability ratings (see further).

76. On balance, taking into account Substantial allocative efficiency but Modest efficiency
of implementation, the overall rating for efficiency is Modest.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

77.    The Project relevance is rated as Substantial, Efficacy is a combination of ratings
for each phase, averaging to Substantial, as explained above, and Efficiency is rated as
Modest given the significant delays in project implementation. Therefore, the overall
Outcome rating is Moderately Satisfactory and is also supported by Table 5 which presents
the weighted disbursement averages before and after restructuring and for the three AFs.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

78. Gender aspects: The project focused most of its interventions on the most vulnerable
groups (women and children) and the monitoring system included disaggregated data. Four
of the nine PDO indicators were particularly focused on women. AF-III included a specific
component to address GBV in non-conflict areas since the 2014 DHS confirmed that GBV
was also a very frequent event in non-conflict areas in DRC, especially among the Pygmy
population, where rape appeared to be a culturally acceptable event. UNFPA was
contracted to raise awareness and train public health professionals in assessing GBV. Once
the interventions started, a situational analysis revealed a higher prevalence of GBV than
expected. Thanks to the project, this theme has been included in the national programming
of the MoPH. The project also added value in this area with the strengthening of the health
information system’s adjustment for reporting on gender-related violence.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

79. Keeping in mind the starting point of the health sector in 2005, the project made
satisfactory progress in building in-country capacity at the decentralized levels. The main
implementation responsibility is at the HZ level, as management and supervision occur at
the province and district levels and policies are set the central level. In recent years, the
province level has been provided with much more responsibility in the spirit of
decentralization to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of health sector performance.
Additionally, a very large focus has also been assigned to the HZs level, where service
delivery occurs.

80. There has been an incremental shift toward reliance on in-country NGOs to serve as
purchasing agencies rather than international organizations in order to focus on building
in-country capacity and cost-efficiency measures. The IPs changed roles several times over
the duration of the project and gradually handed over fiduciary and coordination
responsibility to the district level. These tasks have now been assumed by district health
administration staff as a result of the knowledge and skills transfer accomplished by the
PARSS. The new project will be managed by the MoPH itself through the combined
collaboration of the DEP (Direction des Etudes et Planification), the Financial
Management Unit, and the Procurement Unit. Hence, there is now less reliance on an
autonomous implementation agency as was done under the PARSS project, there is now
greater reliance on in-country systems.

81. In the last 18 months as part of the third AF implementation, the Bank has shifted its
strategy to scale up PBF, a strategy that has been piloted in DRC over the past 10 years.
PBF supports various levels of the health system (starting with the health facilities) in
developing results-oriented action plans and making payments based on the results (quality
and quantity) achieved. This approach is the central focus of the new health system
strengthening project, which will cover 140 HZs, reaching approximately 25 percent of the




                                             25
population of DRC. The expanded reach is possible due to the harmonization of financing
with key partners, notably UNICEF, the Global Fund, GAVI, and UNFPA.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

82. Although this was not foreseen as a specific capacity-building opportunity during
preparation, the close collaboration of the Public School of Health of the University of
Kinshasa, the Catholic University of South Kivu, and the Free University of the Great
Lakes with international universities to conduct the malaria-control surveys strengthened
their capacity in survey methodologies, reporting, and results dissemination.

83. Donor coordination: The Bank’s presence in DRC in the health sector played a pivotal
role in strengthening donor coordination as the project on the one hand relied on few
partners such as UNICEF, UNFPA, WHO to implement part of the project but also was a
conduit for other partners such as the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
to invest in the health sector and align some of their activities to the project. The new
US$220 million health project is founded on a strategic alignment with USAID, GAVI,
Global Fund, UNICEF, and UNFPA. The Bank is also leading the sub-group on health care
financing and is present in all the other sub-groups focusing on key pillars of the health
system thus strengthening the technical and coordination of the health sector and ensuring
better alignment to the Government’s health strategy. Finally, with DRC being one of the
pilot countries for the Global Financing Facility this alignment will be further strengthened
in the coming years to support the achievement of maternal and child health results by
2030.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder
Workshops

N.A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Significant

84.     The risk rating at the design stage was high due to the potential recurrence of
conflict and continued weaknesses in governance and fiscal management. The risk was
and continues to remain significant; and at times became high due security concerns in
some regions and violence and uncertainties during the election period. The risk rating at
the design stage was moderate for progress in other sectors that could influence health (road
rehabilitation, water supply, food security, and education), and attention was paid to
financial barriers to access to health services.

85.     The main risk to the development objectives is the ability of the health sector
to provide essential services at the local level. The overall risk rating at the design stage
of the project was moderate and it remains as such. The risk mitigation mechanism in place
now is the close donor coordination on the PBF approach being implemented nationwide.


                                             26
A recent public expenditure review will be followed by a health financing strategy and
investment case to help government enhance sustainability.

86. Government expenditure in health has increased, whether measured as a
percentage of GDP or as a proportion of total public expenditure. Unfortunately, the
data suggests some crowding out in recent years, with private sector expenditure, measured
as a share of GDP, declining by almost 50 percent since 2009. As a result, after a brief
(countercyclical) burst between 2008 and 2010, the country’s total expenditure in health
remains at very low levels, below 4 percent of GDP (see Annex 3, figure A3.1). The
forthcoming DRC Health PER shows an increase in public funding for health from US$1.9
per capita in 2008 to US$2.8 per capita in 2013. However, an analysis of public health
expenditures as a percentage of GDP shows that there was a decrease from 4.6 percent in
2008 to 4.5 percent in 2013. The contribution from external financing increased from 33.5
percent of the total health budget in 2008 to 37 percent in 2013.

87. There is some evidence that improvements in some indicators waned during a brief
period in which the project encountered implementation problems due to delays in
financing. This can be seen as a “natural experiment” that could suggest that the
intervention was indeed having a positive health impact. However, at the same time it
shows clearly the continuing dependence on very heavy donor involvement, both
financially and technically. Finally, despite the growing capacity at the local health levels,
institutional capacity remains weak and requires continued substantial support in the
foreseeable future. Project and financial sustainability is rated moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

88. The Bank team made considerable efforts but had little control over issues that
primarily affected readiness for implementation during the first two years of the
project. The issues were linked to the challenging operational environment post-conflict,
very weak governance systems, and completely deteriorated health system, coupled with
the selection of the most challenging regions in which to focus project activities.
Governance and personality issues were beyond the control of the project team but required
government intervention that at that stage could not be counted on.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

89. The project was well supervised, with multiple missions over the period of the project,
an average of two missions annually. For about half of the project period, the task team
leader was based in the field, allowing for rapid and intensive follow-up and dialogue. An
MTR and QAG were conducted after three years of implementation. The ISRs have been


                                             27
candid, proposing mitigating measures and requesting timely management support.
However, the kind of rapid decision making needed at all levels (management and team)
in the unstable environment in which the project was implemented, especially in the early
years, was at times lacking, this contributed to the project’s implementation delays. For
example, the MTR and the subsequent restructuring took about a year to finalize and
eventually resulted in improvements in the field, with disbursements going up and activities
accelerating.

90. During the first years of the project, supervision focused almost entirely on
dealing with procurement problems delays and getting the main contracts out. The
nature of the project was heavily procurement focused with large funding. The Bank
decisions and support on procurement in particular were slow and insufficient. More pro-
active and timely support could have significantly contributed to improvements on the
ground. This weak support on procurement from the Bank team continued throughout the
project implementation period.

91. Team presence on the ground (including long presence of TTLs) helped to move
implementation forward. The team conducted regular fiduciary reviews, although there
are few written documents. Progressively throughout the project the Bank team tackled
many of the issues and managed slowly but steadily to focus on the right areas with the
right actors to implement the project. Reporting on these areas was candid in the ISRs, and
follow-up was provided to governance problems—sometimes before they happened—such
as early rejection of and recommendations on questionable procurement recommendations.
The team also made careful preparations to ensure the good performance of the
management entities, including formulation with the Borrower of an Action Plan and
auditors TORs. Safeguard missions were less well documented, in particular with regards
to follow up on recommendations. .

92. Despite the Bank’s efforts, attention to building the capacity of the MoPH was
deficient. Much attention was given to resolving fiduciary issues and the need to
effectively start project implementation. This focus deterred the need to build capacity for
MoPH stewardship and donor harmonization. After implementation finally started
following the 2010 restructuring, the focus of the Bank team shifted to the preparation of
the three AFs that were prepared in a short time period, sidelining again the capacity
building and harmonization dimensions. Only after procurement hurdles were eliminated
in the last years of the project and implementation went more smoothly did the Bank team
have time to focus on sustainability issues, such as promoting capacity building and
reviewing new approaches to implementation/service delivery, including PBF. Only with
the third AF, a change in service delivery approach, and a step-up in donor harmonization
was better and more attention paid to building MoPH capacity.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

93. Rating: Based on the Moderately Satisfactory rating for quality at entry and Moderately
Satisfactory rating for quality of supervision, overall Bank performance is rated
Moderately Satisfactory.



                                            28
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

94. One of the main concerns voiced during the implementation completion review mission
by the MoPH, donor partners, IPs, and the PCU itself was their lack of real engagement
with the ministry. Although technical departments were involved, they remained on the
margin until late into the project. At the intermediary level, the situation was much better,
and medical inspectors and health managers were fully engaged, again especially after the
first implementation hurdles were eliminated and contracts were in place. At the local
health center level there was very good collaboration. Much of the lack of central-level
engagement was the result of the strong leadership of the PCU coordinator, who himself
came from the ministry and felt only a limited need to consult at regular intervals. However,
the ministry also did not make much effort to remain engaged and left the PCU to manage
the project very independently.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

95. The strong leadership of the PCU was an advantage and a constraint for project
implementation, as it stood in the way of relations with the MoPH and the BCECO, which
led to impasses and delays in contracting during the important start-up years. After all had
been smoothed out, the capabilities of the coordinator became more visible with the quality
of the PCU’s organization of the health forums, project documentation, and management
and supervision of the IPs. However, a well-organized forum is not sufficient for success,
as commitment and real engagement from all stakeholders are needed as well. The latter
was difficult to foster in a climate of limited collaboration between the PCU and the
ministry. One key concern that long remained an obstacle and was insufficiently addressed
during the entire implementation period was the persistently weak procurement capacity,
which often led to urgent requests requiring rapid rather than comprehensive reviews of
procurement packages, thereby reducing quality and increasing the risks of even more
delays. During the last years of the project and the management of the AFs, capacity was
built at the provincial and district levels of the MoPH and overall management has
improved. At the same time, the decision to contract out very large parts of the
implementation to partner organizations, and the management of those contracts, can be
rated Satisfactory. After initial procurement of the large contract issues, the implementation
and monitoring advanced smoothly and contributed to a large extent to the success of the
malaria control and polio control programs.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory




                                             29
96. Limited engagement at the central level was in part due to the urgency of getting
the project started, this pushed the PCU to focus on moving ahead with the
contracting and to neglect various channels of communication. The Project
Coordinator at the time came from the ministry and followed its strategy, but he failed to
communicate regularly with his colleagues and report on project interventions, problems,
and achievements. After restructuring and with the three AFs, during the last years of
implementation the situation improved. More responsibility for implementation was
moved to the ministry, regular communication took place (which then became a
requirement), and much more attention was focused on the capacity building of the health
sector itself. The new project will be implemented by the DEP directly with support from
the other ministerial units.

6. Lessons Learned

97. Comprehensive capacity and realistic readiness assessments at project appraisal
are very critical in fragile states/post-conflict areas. The project’s ambitiousness given
the collapsed health system, its challenging geographical coverage and the country context,
coupled with very weak institutional capacity and significant governance challenges,
should have benefited for more explicit assessment of institutions and risks and stronger
measures to mitigate the occurrence of project-related risks. Therefore, the project team
and Bank management could have applied more stringent criteria to readiness and
preparation to address the weaknesses in implementation capacity. The reliance on local-
level NGOs —even with their demonstrated experience—was overestimated as was shown
at the outset, mainly because of the unexpectedly challenging environment of the selected
regions, which had been underestimated.

98. Realism in target setting and timely documentation of progress is essential. The
many changes in indicators, including wording, targets and completely new indicators
added over the course of the restructuring and AFs added much complexity to monitoring
and evaluating the project progress. Better documentation on progress on these indicators
and more realistic assessment before changing targets would have simplified subsequent
assessments.

99. Parallel implementation structures are justified in fragile environments but need
to be accompanied by a strong focus on sector capacity building and rigorous follow-
up. In DRC, the health sector had all but collapsed and was in great need of rebuilding,
which, at the time, the national health system was not equipped to handle. Given that
situation, the project contracted out most of the interventions to third parties and donor
partners (UNICEF, WHO, UNFPA). Although all contracts were accompanied by clear
mechanisms to concurrently build national health sector capacity, due to the many
implementation problems, attention to this area often fell short. After most of the project
supervision management went to solving procurement problems and getting contracts
signed and intervention started, little communication and real capacity building of the
national health system took place except at the intermediary levels. After restructuring,
most attention went to the AFs and the focus was on quick results, understandably, given
the malaria and polio threats. One exception needs mentioning which is the polio



                                            30
vaccination effort driven by the NIP. Only during the last years of the project did the
implementation arrangements change to give more responsibility and the needed capacity
building to the sector, it is now showing results. The new project will rely much more on
the sector itself for implementation.

100. Rebuilding health workers’ trust in the health system is paramount to service
delivery. The project clearly shows the importance of motivating health workers and
rebuilding their trust. The project’s component 1 included a provision of motivational
bonuses with some discretion for facilities on how to divide the bonuses. Added to this
were the improvements in the work environment and the enhanced provision of medicine
and pharmaceuticals. The introduction of the “bonus de démarrage” (start-up bonus) with
the AF-III especially gave new life to the project’s objective of improving health facilities.
This bonus was used to purchase new beds for maternity wards and to provide improved
infrastructure such as latrines and sanitation.

101. Bank-supported projects can bring in new focus and leverage funding to pilot
interventions. The gender-based violence pilot in a non-conflict region is a good example
of making funds available and contracting out a pilot in a theme-area that was not
recognized as an urgent issue. The pilot managed by UNFPA was very successful and will
be scaled up in the next project. The PBF pilot is another example of how the project, with
leveraged funds, introduced a new approach to financing the system. The pilot was
evaluated and produced results that confirmed that RBF could work in DRC. Many of the
lessons and findings of this pilot are also included in the new health project, which will
scale up and implement the PBF approach nationally.

102. A vertical approach to rebuilding a decimated health system should be
accompanied by a health systems strengthening approach. The project was started with
the purpose to rebuild a deteriorated health sector. The approach to rebuilding at the time,
in a very weak environment, was to focus on getting the vertical service delivery functional
again. In the ten-year implementation period, the situation evolved and the importance of
not only rebuilding the basic services at the local level but also the system itself, became
important. The project, with the help of the Trust Funds, initiated some work on
strengthening the health system, in the areas of health financing and financing mechanisms,
but much more remains to be done. The project provides many lessons to be taken on in
the new operation.

103. The design and implementation of the DRC – Katanga pay-for-performance
pilot project was incorrect in many aspects and this has led to an absence of results.
15 years of accumulated lessons learned, the collective science of implementation for
Performance-based financing (PBF) projects has led to a wealth of lessons learned related
to design and implementation aspects that taken together, much enhance the probability of
showing strong effects [Reference: Chapter 17, Fritsche, György Bèla; Soeters, Robert;
Meessen, Bruno. 2014. Performance-Based Financing Toolkit. Washington, DC: World
Bank. © World Bank. https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/17194 License:
CC BY 3.0 IGO.”]. DRC has been at the core of lessons learning for PBF design and
implementation, as it has benefited of various pilot PBF programs since 2000. The exact



                                             31
areas of design and implementation that were at fault have been well- documented in the
World Bank policy note on the Katanga Impact Evaluation and will not be repeated here
[reference: Policy note]. Suffices to say that design and implementation characteristics of
scaled up PBF projects in Rwanda and Burundi [References: Basinga, P., P. Gertler, et al.
(2011). "Effect on maternal and child health services in Rwanda of payment to primary
health-care providers for performance: an impact evaluation." The Lancet 377: 1421-
1428; Bonfrer, I., R. Soeters, et al. (2014). "Introduction of Performance-Based Incentives
in Burundi was Associated with Improvements in Care and Quality." Health Affairs 33(12):
2179-2187; Bonfrer, I., E. v. d. Poel, et al. (2014)]. "The effects of performance incentives
on the utilization and quality of maternal and child care in Burundi." Social Science &
Medicine 123: 90-104].was chosen as a basis to re-design the PBF project, and this re-
designed PBF project forms the core of the current PDSS program.

104. Institutional continuity in leadership over the project and adequate
supervision resources are important. Not only was the PARSS an ambitious project in a
very challenging environment, over its lifetime, three AFs were added, two restructurings
took place and three Trust Funds were used to support the project. Over that same period,
four task team leader changes took place at crucial moments in the project. The experience
with these changes - the delays that were incurred, the steep learning curves for those taking
over – call for a more careful consideration for the institutional continuity and adequacy in
resources to manage a project of this magnitude and complexity and challenging context.

105. Was the use of AFs appropriate in the DRC context? A final lesson of the
PARSS relates to the use of the three additional financings as instruments. AF-I was
justified as providing very timely additional resources to address an urgent problem. It also
provided an easy instrument to use available resources at the time. The AF-II also was
justified as providing timely resources to prevent a potential epidemic from happening.
Both were implemented very successfully and had they been evaluated by themselves,
would have been highly satisfactory projects. However, they (the AFs) came at a cost to
the original project which had to divert attention and resources to managing very large
contracts, with limited procurement capacity, and coordinating with many partners at the
same time. The AF-III was less well justified as an additional financing, as it really picked
up several pieces and provided a financing gap which should not have occurred; a new
project should have been prepared instead and this would have allowed the project to
address the then clear implementation problems more effectively.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

This section presents the findings from the economic and financial analysis of the project.

Economic context and the health sector

As noted in the main document, in 2004–05 when the project was being prepared, the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) was beginning to recover from the Congo Wars that
ended in 2003 with the appointment of the Transitional Government. Since 2005, the
country has been experiencing high rates of economic growth (averaging over 6 percent
per year), a trend that was partially interrupted in 2009 by the international financial crisis,
when GDP growth fell below 3 percent. These high rates of growth are important to a
country that is still among the poorest in the world, with a population that continues to
increase by almost 3 percent per year and has a fertility rate of approximately five children
per woman.

World Development Indicators (WDI) data suggest that these economic improvements
have been only partially transferred to the financing of the health sector. The data show a
general pattern of growth until 2009 and a decline after that. This pattern is observed in
terms of public expenditure in health (whether measured as a percentage of GDP or as a
proportion of total public expenditure) and with respect to private sector expenditure. As a
result, the country’s total expenditure in health has remained very low, generally below 4
percent of GDP, with 2013 levels not much different from those seen in 2004 after the wars
(see figure A3.1 below), and the country continues to have one of the lowest per capita
health expenditures in the region.

Perhaps the most positive outcome in the financing of reform in the health sector is the
more than 40 percent reduction in the share of out-of-pocket expenditure in the country’s
total health expenditure observed between 2005 and 2013, from approximately 57 to 33
percent. The decline in out-of-pocket expenditure is most likely explained by an increase
in both external financing and public expenditure, as figure A3.2 indicates.20 It should be
noted that the sharpest decline in out-of-pocket expenses occurred when total health
expenditures were increasing the most (i.e., between 2006 and 2009), and the decline
continued even when the share of external financing dropped (e.g., between 2006 and
2007). Whatever the main cause, the data suggest that individuals are using less of their
moneys to pay for care, and out-of-pocket expenditure is no longer the main source of
health financing in DRC.

Despite these mixed results in health financing, health outcome indicators improved
throughout the period in which the project was implemented, for instance:

       -   life expectancy at birth increased between 2005 and 2013 for both women and men, and
           relatively more for the former, from 49.4 years to 51.8 years and from 46.3 years to 48.2
           years, respectively;
       -   although still high, infant mortality declined between 2005 and 2013, from 104.9 to 86.1
           deaths per 1,000 live births.




20
     The reduction/elimination of some of the user fees may have also contributed to this trend.


                                                                                             47
Economic analysis

It should be obvious that these improvements cannot be directly attributed to the Bank’s
intervention. The same applies for the discussion that follows. The extent to which the
project can explain the improvements observed in the health outcomes monitored can only
be assessed with a proper impact evaluation. In this sense, it must clear that this analysis
does not have a counterfactual against which results can be can compared and that it
assumes that the project does explain the changes in outcomes. Having said that, an
important caveat must be noted: as discussed in the main document, there is some evidence
that improvements in some indicators waned during a brief period in which the project
encountered implementation problems. This can be seen as a “natural experiment” that
could suggest that the intervention was indeed having a positive health impact.

This economic analysis assesses the benefits generated by the Bank’s intervention as they
relate to four of the nine health outcomes or indicators of the Project Development
Objective (PDO):
     i. percentage of deliveries assisted by qualified personnel;
     ii. percentage of pregnant women who slept under insecticide-treated nets (ITN) the night
          before;
     iii. percentage of children less than five years of age who slept under an ITN the night before;
          and
     iv. percentage of children 0–11 months vaccinated with diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus
          (DPT3).

Given the limited time available for this analysis and the scarcity of data, these were the
only indicators that could be translated into health benefits (i.e., truly represented outcome
indicators) and/or for which data could be found and evidence in the literature that estimate
the health impact of these interventions.21 Despite these constraints, they do reflect the
project’s main actions in malaria and maternal and child health.

The 2010 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) dataset provided by the University of
Washington’s Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) was the main source of
information used in the analysis.22 The dataset contains age- and sex-specific estimates for
mortality, disability, disease burden, life expectancy, and risk factors. As the data available
are aggregated at the national level and therefore not specific to the areas of project
intervention, they may not truly reflect the local reality. In this sense, as the areas selected
for the project had some of the country’s worst health conditions, this exercise may be
underestimating the health benefits derived from the intervention.



21
   Regarding the other PDO indicators, it would be almost impossible to provide a reasonable estimate to
measure the health impact of an increase in the rate of curative consultations as well as the use of family
planning. There was no baseline for children immunized with the oral poliovirus (OPV3), and data on the
burden of polio or literature on the effectiveness of the two doses of intermittent preventive treatment (IPT)
on malaria in pregnant women could not be found.

Age- and sex-specific estimates were calculated for years of healthy life lost due to non-
fatal health conditions (or years lived with a disability [YLD]) and years of life lost (YLL)
due to premature mortality, which, combined, generate the disability-adjusted life years
(DALYs) lost. The direct health benefit from the project arises from the YLD, YLL, and
therefore DALYs averted by its intervention. Because the 2010 GBD 2010 data are
nationwide, as noted above, they were adjusted for the population size of the project and
the changes generated during implementation by the Additional Financings (AFs),
particularly in the case of malaria.

Following the recommendations from the second edition of the Disease Control Priorities
in Developing Countries (DCP2) (see Jamison et al. 2006) and the Copenhagen Consensus
(see Jamison, Jha, and Bloom 2008), each DALY averted was converted into monetary
value at three times the per capita income of the year (World Development Indicators
[WDI] data at constant U.S. dollars of 2005). Because individuals (and societies) tend to
prefer to receive benefits sooner rather than later and to incur costs in the future rather than
now, it is necessary to find an instrument to convert the future values of benefits and costs
into a common present value. Discounting does that, as it generates the (net) present value
of the stream of benefits and costs. Following the guidelines from the World Health
Organization (WHO) (Tan-Torres Edejer et al. 2003) and DCP2, the stream of the monetary
value of the annual DALYs averted was discounted at 3 percent. As per these same
guidelines, project costs were also discounted at 3 percent.

We have used the evidence provided by the literature to estimate the effectiveness of
specific interventions supported by the project to combat malaria in children less than five
years of age and in pregnant women (Morel, Lauer, and Evans 2005; Pulkki-Brännström
et al. 2012). More specifically, it was assumed that ITNs reduce the incidence of malaria
by 50 percent and case fatality by 20 percent. Evidence from the literature was also used
to estimate the impact of birth deliveries with skilled professionals on maternal and
neonatal mortality, in particular the regression equations derived by Berhan and Berhan
(2014) (see also Graham, Bell, and Bullough 2001). The DRC mean age at childbearing
(29 years) was used to define the age-specific DALY. Regarding the impact of the DPT3
vaccine, it was assumed that an immunization coverage of 80 percent and above would
protect the entire cohort of children. In order to ensure consistency with the project
duration, the 1–4 age period was used to circumscribe the DALY.

Baseline results

Table A3.1 provides the baseline estimates of the ratio between the net present value (NPV)
of benefits and costs obtained using the assumptions described above. It shows the results
according to the parameters recommended by WHO, DCP2, and the Copenhagen
Consensus (i.e., a discount rate of 3 percent for both benefits and costs and DALYs valued
at three times the per capita income). The mean value is highlighted and shows a benefit-
cost ratio of approximately 3, which means that each dollar invested by the project
generated 3 dollars in benefits. Under these parameters, both the lower and upper
boundaries of the 95 percent uncertainty interval show benefit-cost ratios greater than one.

These results provide some confidence regarding the return on investment (disregarding
the problem of attribution noted earlier).

Sensitivity analysis

In order to assess the robustness of these results, we conducted a sensitivity analysis
exercise varying the different parameters used. Table A3.2 shows the baseline results,
together with a more conservative estimate generated using a valuation of the DALYs equal
to the country’s per capita income. As is to be expected, while the mean value of the
benefit-cost ratio is still (marginally) greater than one, the estimate at the lower boundary
of the 95 percent uncertainty interval falls below unity. Accordingly, if benefits were to be
valued at the average per capita income of DRC, we would not have a very high degree of
confidence regarding the positive returns from the project.

Because the NPV can be very sensitive to the specification of the discount rate, we have
estimated benefit-cost ratios at various scenarios. Again, following the recommendation of
WHO and DCP2, we have estimated NPVs and benefit-cost ratios using a 5 percent

As can be seen from the table, an increase in the discount rate from 3 to 5 percent applied
to the benefits does not move the benefit-cost to below the unity, even at the lower
boundary of the confidence interval, when DALYs are valued at three times the country’s
per capita GDP. This provides additional confidence regarding the “social profitability” of
the project under the recommended parameters for the economic evaluation of health
projects in developing countries. However, with a 5 percent discount rate and DALYs
valued at the per capita GDP, the project ceases to present returns at even the mean value.
We also generated estimates for different values of the discount rate applied to costs. In
addition to the original 3 percent, we have used a discount rate equal to 7 percent (to reflect
the average inflation rate observed in the country since 2010).

The table shows that at the mean value, the project provides positive returns under all
scenarios, except if benefits are discounted at 5 percent and DALYs are valued at one time
the per capita income. The estimated benefit-cost ratios vary from a minimum of 0.43 to a
maximum of almost eight. The results presented in the table are also graphically displayed
in figures A3.3–A3.5 below.

Final discussion

As is always the case with cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis, several assumptions
were used in this exercise. In the particular case of this project, we were forced to estimate
benefits for only part of the interventions supported by the project, thus underestimating
the total value generated by the Bank’s efforts. On the other hand, while we have used the
total cost of the project, we have not incorporated any expenditure incurred by the
Government of DRC in project-related activities, which underestimated the project’s true
cost. Since in the case of DRC public expenditures tend to be small, it is likely that benefits
may have been underestimated to a greater extent than costs, but this is an educated “guess
estimate.” Finally, it should be remembered once again that the strongest assumption of
this analysis rests in the fact that we have attributed all the benefits captured by the outcome
indicators to the project intervention, a fact that cannot be corroborated without a proper
impact evaluation.

Figure A3.6 displays the evolution of the value of the benefits generated by the project
(i.e., the value of the DALYs averted) using the recommended parameters of a 3 percent
discount rate and DALYs valued at three times the country’s per capita income. It shows
that the benefits generated by the project increased after 2010, as the project gained force
and expanded its coverage with the various AFs.

Keeping in mind the limitations of this study, the economic analysis conducted shows that
using the most plausible parameters, the project is likely to have generated positive returns


                                                                        54
for the Congolese people. In fact, if the DALYs averted are valued at the recommended
rate of three times the per capita income, the estimates done in this exercise indicate that
the project provided value for money throughout the entire range of the 95 percent
uncertainty interval, even when increasing the discount rate to 5 percent.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo produced in March 2015 a
completion report which was validated through a stakeholder workshop. The report
confirms based on their own assessment as to storyline, ratings and lessons learned are in
line with the Bank's assessment. They have identified lessons learned which in line for the
most part with the Bank’s own report. Below are the lessons learned and recommendations
from the Government’s report.

1. Recommendations for the Government/ Ministry of Public Health
a) Negotiate with the World Bank and other partners for a continued financing of the
project activities (without delays) in order to conserve and consolidate the achievements of
the project;
b) Negotiate the scaling up of the health zones reached in the new project for better
coverage of the country;
c) Consider a better integration of the institutional arrangements of the project in the health
system. The teams of technical assistants of the new project should be integrated into the
Ministry’s structures as well as the supported districts.
d) Identify and contract out providers (public or private) in order to reach all the Provinces
in DRC;
e) Change the input approach which turned out to be inefficient as many commodities
purchased through the project at the central level didn’t reach the facilities in time as
planned. The Government/Ministry of Public Health could provide funding directly to the
health centers which can pass their own requests once pre-qualified suppliers have been
selected;
f) Consider mechanisms at the provincial level for a better use of human resources.
Initiatives with the private sector may allow a more efficient use of the health workers at
different levels of the health system;
g) Harmonize the World Bank disbursement procedures with national practices for relief
of these procedures;
h) Negotiate with the World Bank and other partners the extension of the PBF approach in
other sectors other than health (eg education).

2- To the World Bank
a) Sustaining the achievements of the project through the implementation of a new project
    using the performance based approach;
b) Encourage a best practice approach of the performance-based financing strategy
c) Consider the introduction of the PBF approach in other sectors other than health (eg
    education);
d) Encourage the support to the victims of sexual violence;
e) Alleviate funds disbursement procedures in the context of the harmonization/
    alignment (Paris Declaration)

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower’s ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR


A consultation with representatives from the Ministry of Public Health on the
Implementation Completion Report was held on September 28, 2015. The report was
discussed with emphasis on the outcomes and the final performance ratings. The
representatives agreed with the final ratings, after further explanations from the team and
appreciated the discussion on the lessons learned described in the report. The government
representatives’ highlighted additional lessons learned that were incorporated in the final
version.


Furthermore, the French version of the ICR report was shared with the Government who
advised the Bank that the Ministry of Health didn't have any additional comments
pertaining to the ICR and take notes of the project accomplishments as well as lessons
learned
