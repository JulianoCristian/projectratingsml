It would also\n            provide treatment facilities for 6.1 cubic m/sec of\n            industrial wastes. It would include: connection of 550,000\n            households to the sewerage system; construction of 5,500 km\n            of sewage collectors; 60 km of sewage interceptors; 10\n            sewage pumping stations; and three secondary sewage\n            treatment plants with an aggregate initial capacity of 14.5\n            cubic m/sec. The project would also include 8,620 man-months\n            of consultancy services for preparation of final engineering\n            and bidding documents; supervision and administration of\n            construction; start up of operations of the treatment plants\n            and pumping stations; monitoring of industrial effluents;\n            and personnel training. About 40% of the beneficiaries would\n            be low-income urban dwellers. The project faces no special\n            risks although delays in the implementation could occur as a\n            result of its magnitude and technical complexity."}, "docdt": "1978-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
