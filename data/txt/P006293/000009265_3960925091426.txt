GREATER SAO PAULO SEWAGE COLLECTION AND TREATMENT PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is a project completion report of the Greater Sao Paulo
Sewage Collection and Treatment Project for which Loan 1525-BR was approved
in Februarv 1978 in the sum of US$110.0 million.  The Loan was closed in
September 1984 and US$57.5 million was cancelled in January 1985.
The project comple.ion report of May 19, 1986 was prepared by the
Latin America and Caribbean Projects Department on the basis of the
findings of an April 1986 mission, documents contained in Regional files
and information provided by Bank staff members involved with the project
during its execution.   The Borrower (the State of Sao Paulo Sanitation
Company - SABESP) prepared a project completion report and an evaluation
letter (Annex 8), and was most helpful in providing information.
In accordance with the revi~ed prucedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft report
to the Borrower and the Executing Agency for comments. Comments received
from SABESP have been reproduced as an Attachment to the report.

HIGHLIGHTS
This was the third Bank operation in the sector in Sao Paulo and
the fifth in Brazil.  The project was to improve health and environmental
conditions in Greater Sao Paulo (GSP) through the implementation of the
first stage of the master plan for sewage collection and treatment.
Project works included provision of sewer connections to 550,000 households
and construction of collectors, interceptors, pumping stations and sewage
treatment facilities.   The project also included technical assistance to
reduce unaccounted-for water and improve operations of the executing agency
(the State of Sao Paulo Sanitation Company -- SABESP). The Bank Loan was
to finance the purchase of equipment and materials for the pumping stations
and sewage treatment plants.
Project execution initially proceeded well.  Beginning in 1981,
however, progress slowed because of shortages of national and state
counterpart funds.   In addition,  for political,  financial and technical
reasons, the wealthy, non-PLANASA ABC municipalities did not construct
collectors to connect with the ABC sewage treatment plant (para. 3.02).
Because the political issues proved intractable, SABESP stopped work on the
ABC plant and transferred the resources thus released to the two other
sewage treatment plants, the smallest of which (Suzano) was completed in
1982.   Works on the Barueri sewage treatment plant slowed and eventually
came to a virtual stop.
Because of SABESP's financial constraints and Brazil's economic
condition, SABESP reassessed its sewerage plans in 1985-84.   The project
was revised to shift emphasis from sewage treatment to collection (para.
3.03).   The project execution period was lengthened and the scope of the
worcs and project costs were reduced. As SABESP's financial problems could
not be solved readily, the Borrower requested that US$57.5 million be
cancelled in early 1985.
By June 1986, about 450,000 households had been connected to the
sewer system.   Construction of the Barueri  treatment plant resumed in
January 1986; SABESP expects to complete the plant in 1989 (para. 3.04).
Work on the ABC treatment plant, which has been at a standstill since 1982,
is planned to start again after agreement with the ABC municipalities has
been reached.  A two-year construction period is expected.  The third and
smallest of the treatment plants is currently operating at 10% of its



- (v) -
capacity, mainly because disagreements on appropriate levels of industrial
charges led one industry to construct its own treatment facilities (para.
3.05). SABESP now plans to fully use the installed capacity by conveying
to the plant sewage from adjoining areas.
The large number of households connected to the sewer system lead
the project completion report to conclude that the targets for sewage
collection set at appraisal are likely to be met, albeit after substantial
delay.   The project failed to meet the targets for sewage  treatment,
however. Other conclusions and lessons to be learned are that:
(a)  the Bank should have caused SABESP to have obtained legally
binding agreements with the ABC municipalities to construct
the collectors and interceptors or should have dropped the
component from the project (para. 8.03);
(b)  greater attention should have been paid to the possible
effects of the price elasticity of industrial water supply
and sewage treatment (para. 8.05) on demand, and thus on the
sizing of project components and on SABESP's finances;
(c)  equal  attention  should  have  been  paid  to developing a
flexible implementation schedule that would have allowed
completion of integrated components in the event of changes
in financial and economic conditions (para. 8.02); and
(d)  specific provisions are being made under the proposed Second
Industrial Pollution Control Project (scheduled for Board
Presentation in FY87) to improve communications between
CETESB and SABESP to avoid duplication of facilities and to
optimize the use of existing sewage treatment infrastructure
(para. 8.04).

GREATER SAO PAULO SEWAGE COLLECTION AND TREATMENT PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01       This was the third Bank operation in the sector in Sao Paulo1/
and the fifth in Brazil.  The project was to improve health and environ-
mental conditions in Greater Sao Paulo (GSP) through provision of sever
connections to 550,000 households and through construction of sewage
collectors, interceptors, pumping stations and sewage treatment facili-
ties. The Bank Loan was to finance the purchase of equipment and materials
for the pumping stations and sewage treatment plants.  By June 1986, about
450,000 households had been connected to the sewage system (Annex 3).
Thus, appraisal targets for sewage collection are likely to be met, albeit
after substantial delays.   The project failed to meet  the targets  for
pollution control, however.
1.02       At the time of appraisal (December 1976), Brazil's total popul-
ation was estimated at 113 million with an average annual growth rate of
2.9%.  The urban population was estimated at about 68 million (60% of the
total),  and was growing at a rate of 5.5% a year.   GSP2/,  the most
industrialized area in Brazil, contained 10% of the country's population.
GSP's population growth rate was estimated at about 5% in the 1970s.  The
growth rate was expected to decline to 3.2% p.a. in the 1980s because of
the development of industrial centers outside GSP.
1.03       One of the main reasons for GSP's development as the country's
premier industrial center is the area's abundant hydroelectric power.
Development of GSP in turn led to increased demand for water for domestic
and industrial use.  To meet this demand, the city was using water from
reservoirs constructed as part of hydroelectric projects and was also
importing water from outside Sao Paulo's water basin.
The Sector
1.04       Service Levels. In the six years prior to appraisal, concerted
efforts were made to improve water service levels in urban areas3/
throughout the country. Service levels increased from less than 60% of the
urban population in 1970 to about 75% in 1976.  The increase in sewerage
coverage was less impressive:  service levels increased from 30% to 33% of
the urban population over the same period.  Disposal of raw or improperly
treated wastes had become a source of increasingly serious water pollution
problems.
1.05       Service levels at appraisal were somewhat better in GSP.  About
85% of the population had access to public water supply. Although 38% of
I/ Loans 757-BR and 758-BR, Sao Paulo Water Supply and Pollution Control
(US$22 million and US$15 million, respectively), both signed June 21,
1971. See Project Performance Audit Report No. 2929 of April 4, 1980.

largest (1977 population: 7.8 million).

the population was connected to public sewerage, only about 4% of the
sewage collected reeeived even primary treatment.   Sao Paulo's ground and
surface water rennuroes w&re being contaminated by raw domestic and
industrial sewago.  The nity's infant mortality rate (80 per 1,000 births)
was the highest in the cotnritry, and the incidence of water-related diseases
was rising, particu1arly among the poor.   To help combat the pollution
problem, the State of O)an Paulo enacted polluition control legislation in
September 1976.
1.06       Sector Tnst4tut ons.  From 1967-1986, the National Houising Bank
(BNH, para. 1.08), was responsible for sector development in urban areas.
The main vehicle for BNH's activities was the National Sanitation Plan
(PLANASA), enaoted In 1970 to accelerate sector development. PLANASA is a
national system fjr planning and financing activities in the sanitation
sector.   Through PLANASA,  national guidelines have been set for project
design,  economic evaluation of projects and procurement.   At the local
level, State Water Companies (SWCs) were set up to carry out PLANASA. The
State of Sao }'aulo Sanitation Company (SABESP; paras. 1.09-1.11) was
responsible  'or executing PLANASA and the Bank project.   By the time of
appraisal,  2,000 of the country's 3,924 municipalities were  covered by
PLANASA.  The municipalities that did not elect to become members of SWCs,
and thus of PLANASA, were usually relatively well off and did not wish to
relinquish control over their systems to the SWCs.
1.07         The Speciai Secretariat for the Environment (SEMA) under the
Ministry of the Interior -as responsible for pollution control at the
national level.4! The Environmental Sanitation Technology Company (CETESB)
is the environmenital pollution control enforcement agency for the State of
Sao Paulo.
The Borrower
1.08        The Borrower was BNH5/.  BNH, established in 1964, was one of
the largest Government-owned development banking institutions in Brazil.
During project execution, it reported to, but was administratively and
financially independent of, the Ministry of the Interior.   BNH's lending
activities were concentrated in low-cost housing, urban development and
sanitation. BNH's primary sources of funds were an employers' payroll tax
and amortization and interest on its loan portfolio. BNH's accounting and
financial planning were satisfactory.  BNI's budgets were approved by the
Monetary Council.
The Executing Agency
1.09       The executing agency was SABESP.  SABESP, the largest sanitation
public utility in Brazil, was created in December 1973 by merging the four
agencies which had been responsible for providing water supply and sewerage

services  to GSP.   At appraisal,  SABESP was providing water supply and
sewerage services to 200 of 281 municipalities with populations of 5,000 or
more  throughout  the  State.    It  also  sold  bulk  water  to  independent
municipalities; SABESP is governed by a six-member Administrative Council,
chaired by a President.  The members of the Administrative Council and the
President are appointed by the State Governor  to four-year terms.   At
appraisal, SABESP was organized into five departments, each headed by a
director appointed by the Administrative Council (Annex 1). At appraisal,
SABESP's staff numbered 12,500 or a satisfactory 6.3 employees per thousand
water connections.
1.10        By appraisal, SABESP had largely overcome the managerial and
organizational problems it had inherited from its predecessors.   Its man-
agement was highly qualified, and modern techniques were used for planning,
budgeting,  financial  control  and  operations.    SABESP's  computerized
accounting system provided satisfactory financial statements. Comparisons
of actual and budgeted financial data were produced monthly.  The billing
and  collection  system  was  also  satisfactory;   outstanding  accounts
receivable were equivalent to 3.3 months of billings.   Annual financial
statements were audited by acceptable external auditors.
1.11         In 1974-1976, SABESP was unable to meet the rate of return
covenants in Loans 757- and 758-BR because of low initial tariff levels and
Federal Government restrictions on rate increases, inadequate cost controls
in 1974 and early 1975, spiralling inflation of construction costs and the
poor financial position of SABESP's predecessors.   SABESP took steps to
expand its revenue base and control costs during this period, but internal
cash generation was insufficient to cover debt service mainly because rates
were increased too little and too late. In addition, the tariff structure,
particularly for bulk water sales and for sewage collection and treatment,
needed  improvement.   SABESP made ends meet by increasing its accounts
payable and by cbtaining substantial State equity contributions.
II. PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.01      Project preparation began during execution of Loan 758-BR.  Funds
under the Loan firanced the services of local and foreign consultants to
define a master plan to abate water pollution in the GSP area.   The
consultants proposed three alternati'e solutions, none of which presented a
clear, significant economic advantage over the other alternatives.   After
taking into consideration various non-quantifiable factors, the consultants
recommended the adoption of the solution (SANEGRAN) supported by Bank
Loan 1525-BR.Because of thie large projected investments to be made and the
different approaches espoused by local engineers and other groups,  water
pollution control has always been a sensitive political issue in Sao
Paulo.  Although the Governor approved the project in December 1976, not
all political forces in the state were convinced that SANEGRAN was the best
solution to GSP's pollution problems.



- 4 -
2.02        Major issues during project preparation and appraisal included
SABESP's financial diffi-ilties (para. 1.11) and the project financing plan
(para. 2.03).   A major constraint on SABESP's financial performance had
been Federal Qovernment restrictiong on rate increases during a period of
high inflation.   In early 1977, the President of Brazil was expected to
submit legislation to the Congress that would give the SWCs more autonomy
in rate setting and improve their financial performance substantially. The
legislation became the National Tariff Law, passed in 1978.
2.03       There were two main issues related to the financing plan.  The
first concerned the availability of counterpart funds.   The 1977 budgets
for both BNH and the State were under review and were expected to be
reduced. In addition, delays in obtaining State counterpart funds had been
a cause of slow execution of the first two projects.   Because correcting
Sao Paulo's water pollution problem remained a very high priority, the Bank
did not anticipate difficulties in obtaining counterpart funds.  Agreement
was reached on countsrpart funding in August 1977 (para. 3.01).  The second
financing plan issue was related to the amount of the Bank Loan and the
part of the project it would finance.  The Loan amount was increased from
US$80.0 million equivalent to US$110.0 million equivalent (about 9% of
total project cost and 31% of the foreign exchange cost) because local
funds for investment were insufficient to finance materials and equipment
for the sewage treatment plants and the pumping stations.  Because of the
limited Bank funds available and because the Brazilian system of awarding
civil works contracts at that time did not call for international com-
petitive bidding in line with Bank Guidelines,  the Bank Loan did not
finance civil works.
2.04      Because of the need to refine cost estimates, technical specific-
ations,  scheduling and financial projections,  there were  five missions
between appraisal and negotiations.  Negotiations were held in Washington
January 24-27,  1978.   Substantive modifications in the Loan package at
negotiations included changing the overall financial covenant from a rate
of return to a cash flow  requirement.    Key  Loan covenants  agreed at
negotiations are presented in Annex 2.
Project Objectives and Description
2.05       The main project objectives were to improve health and environ-
mental conditions in GSP through implementation of the first stage of the
master plan for sewage collection and treatment. The population connected
to public sewerage was to be increased from 38% in 1978 to 55% in 1983.
Volume of sewage treated was to be increased from less than 5% to 40% over
the same period. The project was also aimed at improving SABESP's physical
and financial operations.   The project comprised the provision of sewer
connections to 550,000 households; construction of sewage collectors,
interceptors, pumping stations and treatment facilities; and provision of
technical assistance (the project is described in detail in Annex 3).  The
Bank Loan was to finance the purchase of equipment and materials for the
pumping stations and sewage treatment plants.



2.06        There were several other components that were not part of the
project but were considered essential to the accomplishment of the
project's  objectives.    The  Municipality  of  Sao  Paulo,  with  BNH  and
municipal funds, was to execute a program of water course rectification and
canalization for flood control.   The State of Sao Paulo was to prepare a
program of financial and technical assistance to industries connecting to
public sewage systems to permit them to pretreat their wastes.  SABESP was
to prepare and implement regulations and a monitoring and control program
for levels of toxicity of industrial wastes. SABESP was also to determine
criteria to estimate the charges to be paid by industries upon connection
to  SABESP's  system.    The  independent  ABC  municipalities6/  were  to
censtruct the interceptors to conaect to the plant in their area, but there
was no legal requirement for them to do so.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
3.01       The US$110.0 million Loan was approved on February 28, 1978 and
signed on March 10, 1978.  The Bank Loan was to finance 8.9% of the total
cost of the project; BNH, 33.6%; FAE7/, 42.5%; and the State of Sao Paulo,
through capital contributions, 15.0%. There were no special conditions of
effectiveness; the Loan became effective on August 8, 1978, less than two
months later than the original  target.   The project was to have been
executed in 1978-83 (a comparison of the appraisal and current construction
schedules is presented in Annex 4).   The Loan Agreement was amended in
early 1979 to reflect a change in disbursement percentage and, in late
1981, to bring the financial covenants in line with those of Loan 1970-BR
(para. 5.03).
Implementation Schedule
3.02          Project execution initially proceeded well.   Bank-financed
equipment was ordered and delivered on schedule.   Civil works contracts
were awarded on time and construction proceeded satisfactorily, although
there were some minor delays because of difficult physical conditions.
Beginning in 1981, however, BNH and the State of Sao Paulo could not
provide sufficient counterpart funds. Contractors for the civil works were
not paid on time, and progress slowed.  In addition, the ABC municipali-
ties, which had not joined PLANASA, had not begun to construct the
collectors needed to link the sewage system to the treatment plant for
political, financial and technical reasons.  Because it appeared that the
political issues could not be easily or quickly resolved, SABESP decided to
stop works on the ABC treatment plant in 1982 and shift the resources thus
released to the other two treatment plants. The Suzano treatment plant was
completed in mid-1982 (para. 3.04), but work on the Barueri treatment plant
slowed and ground to a virtual halt in late 1984.
3.03       In July 1983, BNH and SABESP submitted to the Bank a proposal to
complete the project, based on a reassessment of sewerage needs and in
light of political,  economic and financial realities.   The proposal, as
revised  in  April  1984,  shifted  emphasis  from  sewage  treatment  to
6/ The municipalities of Santo Andre, Sao Bernardo do Campo and Sao
Caetano, which were not members of PLANASA.

collection. Because sewage flows were expected to be lower than originally
forecast and because of SABESP's financial constraints, project scope, and
thus costs, were to be reduced and 'he execution period, lengthened.   In
particular, completion of the ABC treatment plant was to be postponed until
after 1990 and construction of the Barueri plant was to be divided into two
stages of 3.5 m3/sec each, scheduled for completion in December 1986 and
December  1989.-   Remaining Bank  funds were to be used  to finance civil
works.   Because of the State's and BNH's worsening financial situation,
brought on by Brazil's economic crisis, and BNH's and the State's inability
to commmit sueh a large amount over six to eight years, BNH requested a
cancellation.   On July 30, 1989, the Bank agreed to cancel US$57.5 million
as of January 21, 1985.
3.04       vonstruction of the Barueri treatment plant started up again in
January 1986.  SABESP plans to have the first stage operational in 1987 and
the second stage, in late 1989.   SABRSP also plans to resume work on the
ABC treatment plant in 1988 with completion of the first stage (3 m3/sec)
set for 1990. The complementary works financed by BNH and the Municipality
of Sao Paulo have been almost completed, but the ABC municipalities have
not begun to construct the collectors for which they are responsible.  The
Interamerican  Development  Bank  is  providing  funds  to  construct  the
collectors.
3.05      The Suzano treatment plant is currently using only 10% of its 1.5
m3/sec capacity mainly because the municipality has not constructed
necessary trunk collectors and because a paper mill, which generates   1
m3/sec  of effluent,  has not  connected  to the system.   The paper mill
constructed its own treatment facilities after approval by CETESB and after
it had become apparent that the mill and SABESP could not come to an
agreement on an appropriate charge for treatment.   The mill's plant was
partially  financed  under Loan  1822-BR8/.    SABESP  now  plans  to  fully
utilize the capacity of the Suzano treatment plant by diverting to it
I m3/sec of effluent from areas SABESP had planned to serve through new
sewage treatment plants.
Procurement
3.06          All Bank-financed goods were procured through international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. Contracts for the
treatment plant equipment were awarded to foreign firms associated with
local firms.   Because of the delays in civil works,  equipment for the
Barueri plant had to be stored for several years, and the equipment for the
ABC plant has been in storage since 1982.   The completion mission found
that the equipment was being properly stored, maintained and insured.
3.07      Contracts for civil works and goods financed by local funds were
awarded on the basis of local procurement procedures.   A local firm, in
association with a foreign one, was retained to prepare feasibility studies
and final designs of the treatment plants.   A local consulting firm was

awarded  the  project  management  contract.    SABESP  retained  14  local
construction firms, including some of the largest in the country's well
developed construction industry,  to build the treatment plants.   Eight
local consulting firms participated in the design of the sewage collectors
and interceptors which were built by 49 local construction companies.

3.09       The 35% project cost overrun in current US dollars decreases to
11% when costs are adjusted to 1977 constant dollars, highlighting the
effects of inflation and devaluation over the longer-than-expected execu-
tion period.   The striking decrease in the cost of the pumping stations
(83% in constant dollars) is the result of a decrease in the number of
stations from 10 to 6. Because the number of pumping stations was reduced,
the interceptors had to be laid at a greater depth, resulting in higher
cost of civil works.   Difficult working conditions  also added  to the
increased costs of the interceptors.  The changes in design are justified
by the resulting decrease in estimated operating costs.  The cost of the
equipment was 58% lower in 1977 dollars than expected at appraisal because
of the competitive prices submitted during bidding.
3.10      The cumulative schedule of disbursements (Annex 6) shows that by
the end of Bank FY80, disbursements were more than 50% behind the
optimistic appraisal estimates.   This is partly the result of the lower-
than-expected contract prices for equipment, despite a 1979 amendment to
the Loan Agreement which allowed the cost of local transportation and
insurance to be financed from Loan funds instead of the cost of the goods



and installation alone. Subsequently, the slowdown in civil works delayed
the  installation  of  equipment  and,  thus,  disbursement  for  related
expensea.
Performance of Consultants, Contractora and Suppliers
3.11        Thd consultants, contractors and suppliers all performed well.
The project management firm which vorked with SABESP's small project unit
performed particularly well in coordinating and supervising the work of the
contractors and suppliers for the trestment plants.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.01       SABESP's efforts to control unaccounted-for water have met with
notable success. In 1979-1985, about 45,600 km of distribution system were
analyzed and 28,400 leaks were repaired. Numerous meters vere replaced or
repaired.  Unaccounted-for water declined from 33% in 1977 to 22% (versus
20% covenanted)  in 1983 and 24% in 1985.   Any  further reduction would
require substantial investments and persistent efforts to keep meters in
working order.

SABESP's revenues were below appraisal estimates principally because per
capita water consumption was overestimated (total demand in 1987 is
expected to be 40 m0/s versus original Master Plan projections of 53
m3/s).   In addition,  the number of sewer connections did not grow as
expected because of SABESP's emphasis through 1983 on the treatment plants
and the interceptors and a shift in priority to other works (para. 5.02).
Just as importantly, the recession which began in 1983 helped to discourage
industries from connecting to SABESP's system; firms chose to construct
treatment pLants over which they could exert cost control.  SABESP earned
operating profits in each year; however, heavy debt servicing associated
with the incomplete project works required the State to increase its
capital contribution and assume part of SABESP's debt service beginning in
1982.
5.02        Brazil's economic problems also had a negative effect on the
project financing plan.  BNH's sources of funding (employers' payroll tax
and loan portfolio returns) were adversely affected by the recession and
Government measures to combat the economic problems.   Federal authorities
limited the amount BNH and the state banks could lend for sector
investments. The State's tax revenues were also seriously affected by the
slowdown in the economy.  At the same time, the State funds for the project
were limited as priority shifted to expansion of water supply services in
the metropolitan area, as well as to provision of water supply and sewage
systems in other parts of the State. The shortage of funds is one of the
main reasons for the delay in project completion.
Compliance with Financial Covenants
5.03       The original main financial covenant called for SABESP to earn
revenues sufficient to cover operating expenses, debt service and an amount
equal to a specified percentage of fixed assets. SABESP complied with the
covenant in 1978, 'but not in 1979 (Annex 2).  The Bank agread to waive the
covenant in 1980.   In 1981, covenants under all Bank Loans in the sector
were amended to conform to the provisions of the National Tariff Law. The
National Tariff Law required all SWCs to gradually increase tariffs so that
in 1983, revenues would be sufficient to cover operating expenses plus
depreciation and debt service.  SABESP complied with the amended covenant
in 1981, but not in 1982.   From 1983 on, SABESP was in compliance after
deducting the debt service formally assumed by the State.
VI. STAFFING AND INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
6.01       During the project execution period, the number of communities
covered by SABESP in the interior more than doubled. To better handle this
rapid expansion, the Operations Directorate was split into one Directorate
for GSP and one for the Interior. Rapid expansion is also the main reason
for the increase in the number of SABESP's staff from 12,500 at appraisal
to a high of about 22,000 in 1982, decreasing to about 20,700 in 1983 and



- 10 -
about 20,100 by mid-1985.    During  the same period,  staff productivity
increased:    the  ratio  of employees  per thousand water connections was
reduced from 6.3 at appraisal to 4.6 in mid-1985.
6.02      SABESP iS essentially a well-run, mature organization.  Staff are
competent and experienced. Turnover is low, except when state administra-
tions change. The entity's organization, systems and procedures are satis-
factory. SABESP's maajor institutional problems would appear to be coordin-
ation  with  other  organizations,  including  CETESB,  inability  to compel
industries and non-PLANASA municipalities to connect to its systems and
sensitivity of stratpgy to political influiences.
'VII. .JUSTIFICATION
7.01       the sewage treatment works are not likely to be completed until
1990 (para. 3.01).  Upon completion, waste treatment capacity will be 21%
less than expected at appraisal because of the reduction in capacity of the
ABC plant.   The percentage of population connected to sewerage increased
from 39% in 1979 to 50% in 1985 through the installation of 450,000 house
connections under the project.  About 3,430 km of collectors and 20 km of
interceptors have been constructed. The training program was successful in
preparing SABESP's  staff  to  take over the project works.   The highly
successful unaccounted-for water program is serving as a model for the
efforts of other SWCs.   The study of the multipurpose use of water has
become the master plan for water resource use in the GSP area.
7.02          The economic  rate of return of the project,  has not been
calculated because of uncertainties related to the completion dates of the
sewage treatment plants and the amount of industrial sewage to be treated
at the plants.  An internal financial rate of return was calculated at 11%
at appraisal. It is likely that if a recalculation were to be made a lower
return would be found, given:   (a) the longer investment period; (b) the
higher than estimated costs; (c) the failure of rates to increase as
expected; and (d) the slower pace in reaching anticipated levels of sewage
flows, particularly for industries.
VIII. BANK'S PERFORITANCE, CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS TO BE LEARNED
8.01      During Bank FY78-85, over 120 staff-weeks were devoted to super-
vising the project.   Supervision was most intense during project start up
and during the period the reformulation issue was most active.  Beginning
in late FY83, responsibility for routine project supervision was delegAted
to BNH, freeing Bank staff to concentrate on sector-wide issues, while
retaining the flexibility to deal with specific problems.   Relations with
SABESP appear to have been cordial.   Staff continuity was good, with only
one major change in project team.



- 11 -
8.02            Water  pollution  control  in  GSP  has  always  been  highly
politicized.   Numerous solutions have been proposed over the years, each
with its own vehement supporters. The proponents of SANEGRAN, the solution
supported by Loan 1525-BR, failed to convince other political forces in the
area of SANEGRAN's merits. SABESP's strategy was to start and complete as
much of the works as possible as quickly as possible,  thus making the
incremental   cost   of  attempting   to  implement   any  other   solution
prohibitively high.   Once construction started,  the project could not be
modified  in  response  to  changes  in demand  and  e'nonomic  and  financial
conditions.  This rigidity has proven costly:   maJor components could not
be put to use because complementary works were not built.
8.05        When the last administration, which favored another solution,
took office in 1983 there was a certain reluctance to press wholeheartedly
for completion. The last administration subsequently reviewed the sewerage
master plan; all the alternatives proposed in their plan include the
completion of the project plants.   SABESP intends to submit the chosen
alternative to the state legislature for approval in order to limit the
effects of further changes under future administrations.
8.04        The ABC municipalities were not members of PLANASA.  When the
wealthy, powerful ABC municipalities chose not to construct the collectors
and interceptors to connect to the treatment plant, SABESP lacked the
financial and political leverage to compel them to do so. The Bank should
have required that SABESP obtain legally binding agreements with the ABC
municipalities to construct the collectors and interceptors or should have
dropped the component from the project.  As it is, SABESP is lef-t with a
large unproductive investment in works and equipment, much of which must be
stored, maintained and insured until at least 1990.
8.05         The construction with partial Bank financing of Suzano Paper
Mill's treatment plant appears to indicate that communications within the
Bank and within Brazil could have been better.   This problem is being
addressed through the proposed Second Industrial Pollution Control Project
(US$50.0 million), currently scheduled for Board Presentation in FY87.
This operation emphasizes the creation of formal channels of communication
between Brazilian agencies and the definition of appropriate procedures for
determining least-cost solutions to industrial sewage problems.
8.06      Problems with project financing must be viewed within the context
of Brazil's difficult economic situation and the Government's responses to
it.   BNH's main source of funds  (para.  1.08) dried up as unemployment
increased and real wages fell.   State Government tax revenues were also
seriously  affected  by  the  recession,  and  at  one  point,  the  Federal
Government limited the amount that could be lent to public utilities. As a
result, there was a shortage of funds for investment.  SABESP's financial
situation has also been adversely affected by lower-than-anticipated demand
for both water and sewerage services, particularly from industry. Greater
attention should have been paid to the effects of price elasticity on
industrial demand for water supply and sewage treatment and, consequently,
on the sizing of project works and on SABESP's finance.  Thus, SABESP is
saddled with a substantial investment in infrastructure without the
corresponding revenues to offset the high debt seivicing requirements.

November 11, 1986, we summarize below the main points arising in the dis-
cussions and the execution of the SANEGRAN project for sewage collection
and treatment in Greater Sao Paulo. These comments are intended to assist
in the preparation of the Completion Report and identify those points that
SABESP considers most relevant, together with the main lessons it has
learned in its capacity as executing agency.
1.        PRELIMINARY
From the beginning of the 1950s, water pollution in Greater Sao
Paulo was identified as a basic health and environmental problem.  Over the
subsequent 25 years, four Master Plans were prepared and proposed as solu-
tions to the city's problems, culminating in 1975 with preparation of the
SANEGRAN Master Plan. This was prepared by the Brazilian firm Hidro-
service, in association with the U.S. company Metcalf and Eddy.
Possible World Bank participation in financing the Sao Paulo
Metropolitan Region (RMSP) sewerage program was discussed between SABESP
and an identification mission in September 1976. Preparation and appraisal
hissions visited SABESP in December 1976 and September 1977 respectively.

The Agreement was negotiated in Washington, D.C. in January 1978,
and signed on March 10 of that year, with BNH (Banco Nacional da Habitacao)
as the Borrower and SABESP as Beneficiary.
2.        SUTMMARY OF MAIN OBJECTIVES AND RESULTS
The project had the following main objectives: (1) to decrease
infant mortality and increase life expectancy by improving environmental
and health conditions for the population of Greater Sao Paulo by providing
sewage collection services for 3.5 million people, 40% being low-income
urban dwellers; (II) to increase the population serviced from 38% in 1978
to 55% by 1983 (III) to provide sewage treatment facilities for 5.5 million
people, plus treatment facilities of industrial wastes equivalent to
services for 2.2 million people, raising provision (excluding industrial
effluent) from 4.8% in 1978 to 40% by 1983; (IV) to provide training in the
operation and maintenance of the collection and treatment system, together
with monitoring and control of industrial effluent. These objectives have
been partially attained. First, the infant mortality rate has been reduced
from 72 per thousand live births in 1971 to about 53 in 1982 and 40 in
1985.   Although it is still high by international standards, this a con-
siderable improvement.
As regards sewage collection, the construction of 3,200 km of
sewers between 1978 and 1983 increased the total urban population serviced
to 44%.   Treatment facilities were not increased to the desired degree,
because of a number of factors that will be identified below.
3.        DEMAND AND MARKET FACTORS
Separate demand projections were prepared for the households and
industry.    Household  projections  were  based  on population growth  and
changes in the per capita rate. Recent analysis of the overall population
projections (in studies for the revision of the Master Plan) shows the
following small discrepancies:
YEAR                 MASTER PLAN                REVISED
1980                    12.5
1985                    14.8                     15.0
1990                    17.8                     17.5
1995                    20.4                    19.7
2000                    23.6                     22.2
2005                     -                      24.0



33 -                      ANNEX 8

However, when these projections are broken down to subregional
level, the differences become significant; but this is not the main factor
explaining  the  large  discrepancy  vis-a-vis  current  projections  of
effluent. The main reasons for the overestimated demand were the optimis-
tic projections of the per capita rate and the volume of industrial
effluent, as shown in the following table:
EFFLUENT (m3/sec)
YEAR             MASTER PLAN                REVISED
HOUSEHOLD   TOTAL        HOUSEHOLD    TOTAL
1985           35.5       49.3           14.0        20.6
2000            74.2      98.4           39.7        60.3(*)
(*) Actually referring to the year 2005.
4.        CHANGES IN THE FINANCING OF SANITATION
BNH (the Borrower) was established in August 1964 under Law No.
4,380.   Until 1984, it was attached to the Ministry of the Interior, and
during the project execution period (1977-83) there were no significant
alterations in BNH's Organizational and management structure to affect the
project's progress.
Recently (in 1984) the Ministry of the Interior was reorganized
and the Ministry of Urban Development and the Environment, to which BNH is
now attached, was established.
With respect to the State of Sao Paulo, BNH made the following
changes in the interest rates applied to SABESP's loan during the execution
period:
(a) In March 1980, the interest rate charged by FAE (Fondo Estadual
de Agua e Esgoto) was reduced from 4.5% per year (plus a 1% financial
agent's commission) to 3% per year and 2% per year for water supply and
sewage programs, respectively plus a 0.1% financial agent's commission on
the loan amount.
(b) In April 1982, the BNH interest rate on loans for water supply
and sewerage programs was raised from 7% to 10.5% per year, plus a 1%
financial agent's commission.

5.        THE BENEFICIARY'S MANAGEMENT AND ORGANIZATION
Because of SABESP's rapid expansion into the interior of the
State, entailing incorporation of many municipalities (about 170 from 1977
to 1983), certain changes had to be made in Its organizational structure,
such as the establishment of the Interior Operations Directorate in
September 1979 and SRP (the Presidente Prudente Regional Superintendency)
in January 1981.
Chiefly as a result of this expansion, manpower was increased by
8,100, but at the same time there was an increase in productivity, as
measured by the ratio of employees per 1,000 house connections. This fell
from 6.25 in 1977 to 4.6 in 1985, while overall staff qualifications
remained at an excellent level.
The RMSP and Interior tariff structures were revised in August
1983 and February 1984 respectively, as a result of the introduction of the
"social tariff" price bracket which substantially reduced charges to small
consumers, the loss being offset by the establishment of an additional
pricing bracket and changes in the graduated tariff structure.
During this period (January 1982), the billing system was changed
from bimonthly to monthly, in order to increase financial efficiency.
6.        IMPLEMENTATION
6.1       BIDDING
International competitive bidding was used for procurement of all
equipment financed by IBRD, in accordance with its guidelines. Competitive
bidding in accordance with local procedures was used for civil works and
other equipment financed with local resources.
6.2       PERFORMANCE OF DEVELOPMENT REACHED BY WORKS
In    general,    consultants    and    contractors    performed
satisfactorily.
6.3       STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT REACHED BY WORKS
6.3.1     Treatment Plants
Completion of the initial module (1.5 m3/sec) of the Suzano
treatment plant was 13 months behind the original schedule, since works for
the final disposal of sludge had not been completcd.



ANNEX 8
Page 5 of 10
Because of the shortage of resources, it was decided after a
study to use a submodule for the Barueri treatment plant.  Its 3.5 m3/sec
modular unit is expected to begin operations in 1987.
The works for the ABC treatment plant are at a standstill,
because non-PLANASA municipalities did not construct the trunk sewers for
conveying sewage to the treatment plant.   These will have to be resumed,
and by 1990 a 3.0 m3/sec submodular unit should be in operation.  To this
end, a joint solution is being devised--with the participation of the Sao
Paulo State Government, SABESP and the Inter-American Development Bank--for
construction of the trunk collecting sewers in the municipalities not
participating in PLANASA. These works would convey sewage from these loca-
tions to the treatment plant.
6.3.2     Intexrceptors
Of the 60 km originally planned, 18.5 km have been constructed,
and ITI-6, which will convey sewage to the Barueri treatment plant, is at
the completion stage.   The remainder of the interceptor system will be
revised in light of changes to the Master Plan.
6.3.3     Pumping Stations
One of the pumping stations was eliminated from the Barueri sys-
tem, because of technical changes.  The final pumping station is being com-
pleted, with only the electromechanical components remaining to be
installed. Only project preparation was planned in the case of the remain-
ing two pumping station.
f)p.ly one pumping station rev-,ins to be built in the Suzano sys-
tem, while work on the two planned for the ABC area has come to a
standstill.
6.3.4     Trunk Collecting Sewers
Construction of the trunk collecting sewers could not proceed at
the same time as the program executed by the Mayor's Office, because of the
difficulties encountered by SABESP in obtaining resources from PMSP. How-
ever, in all cases the Mayor's Office has left a strip of ground to enable
SABESP to install them in the future, without detracting from the final
objective.
6.3.5     Collecting Systems and House Connections
About 2,000 km of the collecting systems and 120,000 of the house
connections originally planned remain to be installed.

7.        MAIN FACTORS PREVENTING COMPLIANCE WITH PHYSICAL COMPONENTS AND
COSTS AS ORIGINALLY PLANNED
(a) The cost of the works was calculated in cruzeiros, assuming a
rate of UPC 1 = Cr$200.00.  When the Agreement was signed, the
UPC was equivalent to Cr$213.80, but the cruzeiro costs were
maintained.    From  the  beginning,  therefore,  the  discrepancy
vis-a-vis the UPC was about 7%.
(b) Changes in the UPC between August 1977 and December 1983 were
smaller by about 50% than the readjustments to the works
contracts for the collecting systems and the collection lines.
(c) The unit cost for execution of the secondary and the trunk sewers
was calculated from averages furnlshed by SABESP.  However, the
areas benefiting from much of the works during that period were
rapidly urbanized.   Consequently, there was an increase in road
surfacing, storm drains and other alterations, which raised the
unit cost. The reduced pace of completion resulting from changes
in the project as a means of dealing with these problems also
prevented the objectives from being attained.
(d)  At the beginning of the Agreement, SABESP paid a charge to the
Municipality of Sao Paulo for the road surfaces that it excavated
and that the Municipality had to restore.   The Municipality's
rules then changed, obliging SABESP to restore the surfaces,
which resulted in cost increases,   Similarly, municipal demands
increased for preliminary facilities such as barriers, traffic
signals, and provision of access for pedestrians and vehicles
alongside installation ditches.
(e) BNH insisted that several packages of works requested by SABESP
be broken down into many separate financing processes spread over
several years through the loan period, thus slowing down the flow
of funds.    This  necessitated  the  interruption  of  contracted
works, to which monthly adjustments were applied, thus also
increasing costs and slowing down the rate of installation.
(f) In the particular case of trunk sewers, where work had to be
undertaken repeatedly or in which there was high-density traffic
and no alternative routing, it was necessary to use shield
construction rather than conventional methods, and this both
increased costs and slowed down the installation.



ANNEX 8
Page 7 of 10
(g)  It was also necessary to proceed to expropriations and to the
removal of squatter settlements that had not existed at the
design stage.   These called for legal proceedings,  which are
generally slow and thus delayed the works.
(h)  Adjustment to the contracts for the interceptor exceeded changes
in the UPC.
(i)  The  interceptor  designs  did  not  allow  for  the  use  of  the
necessary metal forms and this caused an unforeseen cost
increase.
(j)  As regards the interceptors, the engineer recommended the use in
several locations of soil stabilization techniques using CCP and
Rotocret cement, because otherwise the ground was not likely to
prove suitable for excavation.   This caused an unforeseen cost
increase.
(k)  Greater use of well equipment and lowering of the water level at
the plants as a result of the unscheduled interruption of works
increased the need for financial resources.
(1)  Because work on the plants  had  been  interrupted,  it became
essential to construct storage facilities for the equipment
already purchased but not yet installed, and provide for such
storage and maintenance. This increased costs.
(m) The need to protect exposed metalwork, together with an increase
in the cost of maintaining facilities at the plants also raised
costs above the planned levels.
8.        OPERATING PERFORMANCE
8.1       PROGRAM TO REDUCE UNACCOUNTED-FOR WATER
In general, the results of the program to reduce unaccounted-for
water were quite satisfactory. In 1977, unaccounted-for water totaled 35%
of water produced, declining to about 25% in 1983, only slightly more than
the planned 20%.  The reduction was achieved at decreasing rates over the
whole of the period in question.
Currently, the economic feasibility of achieving the original 20%
target is being studied, by comparing marginal revenue and marginal cost
(which is rising).

8.2.      TRAINING
The training program consisted of short courses and study abroad
(averaging three months), together with technical visits to installations,
agencies and organizations, and external consultancy work for the provision
of SABESP guidance, training and research. The program also involved tech-
nical assistance and consultancy on the training program itself.
8.3       MULTI-USE (THE SANESP PLAN)
This is a plan for the multiple uses of water resourses in the
Sao Paulo Metropolitan area. It was prepared between October 1981 and July
1983 at the behest of the Special Committee formed pursuant to agreement
between the Ministry of Mines and Energy and the Sao Paulo State Govern-
ment.  A specially contracted private firm undertook the studies.   DNAEE
was responsible for general coordination, and the Executive Committee was
responsible for the monitoring.   The contract was signed with CESP, with
SABESP and Electropaulo as participating agencies. The studies contain an
analysis of alternatives regarding works and operating procedures.
8.4       OPERATION OF THE SUZANO TREATMENT PLANT
The plant's installed capacity is 1.5 m3/sec, and it is operating
satisfactorily with a flow of 150 1/sec, 34% of this being industrial
effluent.   The reason for the low level of utilization is basically that
the municipality of Mogi das Cruzes, which is not operated by SABESP, does
not have the technical capacity for effluent disposal, and certain indus-
trial companies that were expected to supply waste for treatment (such as
Companhia Suzano de Papel e Celulose, with an outflow of about 1 m3/sec)
did not do so.
9.        FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
9.1       COMPLIANCE WITH FINANCIAL CONDITIONS
From 1978 to 1983,  SABESP complied with the terms of Section
4.08, achieving the rate of return stipulated, except for 1979.   A World
Bank letter released SABESP from the obligation of fulfilling the Section's
requirements for 1980.  From 1981, the text of this Section was amended in
order to adapt it to the pricing legislation in force, and a progressive
scheme for covering the debt servicing component was established.
The requirements of Section 4.12 were never fulfilled.

ANNEX 8
Page 9 of 10
In September 1980, cince it had systematically not complied with
this Section, SABFSP proposed to the Bank a progressive program for comply-
ing with these terms, eve,- though lhe Bank had never raised the issue.
9.2       COMPLIANCE WITH THIE LOAN AGREEMENT
When the need to revise the project became clear, utilization of
loan proepfeds wna  suispended.
In mid-1983, a proposal was submitted to the Bank containing a
practical plan for continuing the project (the original objectives having
been revised), in light of the behavior of demand for sewerage services.
This plan was for the utilization of US$40 million in undisbursed
proceeds from Loan No. 1525-BR to finance 35% of the collecting systems up
to the end of 1985, amending the terms of this Agreement, together with an
additional amount of US$80 million from Loan No. 2249-BR to finance 35% of
works on the collecting systems from 1985 to 1987.
This proposal was accepted and supported by the mission, on con-
dition that a financial recovery plan be prepared enabling SABESP to comply
with its financial covenants and calling for revision of the SANEGRAN
Master Plan and action on the reduction of construction costs.
However, budgetary problems prevented formalization of this amendment
to the Loan Agreement, and consequently the World Bank, through BNH, was
requested to cancel the undisbursed balance of the Loan Agreement.   The
measure was adopted in order to avoid the considerable financial problems
that would result from payment of the commitment charge applied to the
undrawn balance during the execution period.
10.       SABESP'S OTHER CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
SABESP satisfactorily fulfilled its other contractual obligations
as specified in Sections 3.04, 3.05, 3.06, 3.07, 3.10, 4.11, 4.13, 4.15 and
4.16.  This was confirmed by the supervision mission that visited Sao Paulo
in June 1983.
11.       THE PERFORMANCE OF THE BANK AND THE BENEFICIARY: POSITIVE AND
NEGATIVE ASPECTS, AND HOW THEIR PERFORMANCES MIGHT HAVE BEEN
IMPROVED
The relationship established between the World Bank and SABESP as
a result of the Loan was extremely beneficial for the Company's institu-
tional development.
