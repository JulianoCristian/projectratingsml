outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: The lesson from\n            the Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL) series was that a\n            broad scope of reforms (an ambitious program with\n            'stretch' goals) may be too demanding and\n            therefore risky. This Development Policy Loan (DPL) solved\n            the problem by narrowing the scope of the operation, having\n            all the prior actions carried out ahead of presenting the\n            operation to the Board, and all funds disbursed in one\n            tranche. In a situation in which there is already steady\n            pressure to reform in order to gain European Union (EU)\n            accession, the approach taken by the DPL makes sense. This\n            operation supported a budget which was supposed to reduce\n            expenditures as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) and\n            reduce the budget deficit. While the results are not yet in,\n            it is not likely that the targets set in the 2010-12 budget\n            framework for 2010, will be achieved. This will partly be\n            due to the prolonged recession which reduced nominal GDP in\n            2009 and is likely to keep it flat or falling in 2010, thus\n            raising all quantities measured as a proportion of GDP. It\n            is also due to the difficulty of downsizing the government\n            sector and containing wage and pension bills, and various\n            other costs. Croatia is in a tough fiscal position for a\n            number of reasons. There is the impact of recession, which\n            is not of Croatia's own making. Second, the tight\n            managed float of the kuna vis-a-vis the euro conditioned by\n            high euroization reduces the maneuvering space for monetary\n            policy and therefore makes immediate fiscal policy\n            adjustment even more necessary. Finally, precious time was\n            lost with structural reforms before the recession outbreak.\n            It makes the necessary structural reforms (particularly in\n            the labor market, including the size of the public sector\n            and social sectors) that much harder to carry out. Yet, it\n            must be done, in order to boost competitiveness, and\n            increase the share of tradable in Croatia's GDP thus\n            putting future growth on a more sustainable footing. Growth\n            will also make it easier to carry out the fiscal\n            consolidation in time for the next downturn in the economic\n            cycle, putting Croatia in a stronger position than during\n            the recent crisis."}, "docdt": "2010-08-23T00:00:00Z"}
