                                         PREFACE

This ICR covers the reforms supported by the Fiscal, Social and Financial Development
Policy Loan. This was a one tranche operation supporting policy actions that had all taken
place by the time the operation was approved by the World Bank Board on January 12, 2010.
Since the loan was closed on its original closing date of April 30, 2010, the period covered by
this ICR is short, roughly from mid-2009 to the date of this report.

The ICR was prepared by Peter Miovic (consultant) and Sanja Madzarevic-Sujster (Task
Leader and Sr. Country Economist). The ICR is based on a detailed desk review of materials
from the Project file, relevant documents of the EU, IMF and the World Bank, field mission
that took place in early June 2010, and interviews with Bank staff in Zagreb. A list of people
interviewed in the field is given in Annex 4.

The team is grateful to the government counterparts for the time and care they took in
answering our questions and for the constructive discussions. The team would also like to
thank Zoran Anusic, Dubravka Jerman, and Matija Laco from the World Bank office in
Zagreb for their assistance.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1. Context at Appraisal
Political Developments
At the time of appraisal of the DPL, Croatia was (and still is) governed by a coalition, led
by the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) party. The coalition government was endorsed by
the Croatian Parliament in 2008 and then reconfirmed under the new Prime Minister Kosor in
July 2009 after the resignation of the former Prime Minister. Croatia was granted EU candidate
status in June 2004, and formal accession negotiations were launched in October 2005. The
negotiations process was stalled for almost a year, starting in October 2008 due to a
longstanding border dispute with Slovenia. On September 11, 2009, Slovenia unblocked
Croatia's EU bid after the two countries reached an agreement to continue talks to resolve their
border dispute with international mediation.
By the time of appraisal, Croatia had opened 27 out of 33 negotiations chapters of the
acquis communautaire with the European Commission, and provisionally closed 12. In its
2009 Progress Report, the EU assessed that Croatia continued to meet the political criteria and
made progress in most areas, including intensified efforts in the field of rule of law. It also
indicated that the government will need to step up reform efforts in the area of the judiciary and
fundamental rights, in particular regarding the independence and efficiency of the judiciary, and
the fight against corruption and organized crime. It also needed to improve its public
administration and competition policy1. With progress in bilateral talks with Slovenia on
resolution of the border dispute, Croatia's EU accession progress had been speeded up, and
authorities were targeting end-2010 for completion of negotiations. Croatia also became a
NATO member in April 2009.
Economic Developments
Before the outbreak of the global crisis, Croatia enjoyed strong economic growth, which
averaged over 4 percent during 2004-08. It was driven primarily by domestic demand spurred
by large capital inflows. Growth was particularly strong in the non-tradables sectors such as
retail and construction as well as in tourism services. This high growth performance led to rapid
convergence with the EU, with its GDP per capita in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms
reaching 63 percent of the EU-27 average in 20082. Poverty also declined during the period,
with the absolute poverty rate falling from 11 percent in 2004 to 6.1 percent in 20083.
As the global crisis unfolded, the Croatian authorities reacted with a range of proactive
policies. Due to declining tax revenues, the fiscal policy had to go through significant
adjustments to protect macroeconomic stability and ensure regular debt service. Politically-
challenging measures on both the revenue and spending sides had to be implemented, while
protecting the effective part of the social safety net. Some of these measures, e.g., reduction of
public sector wages, suspension of pension indexation or the introduction of a solidarity tax,
focused on the short term in order to maintain macroeconomic stability. Building on long-
standing efforts in this area, the authorities also took necessary measures to safeguard financial
intermediation.
These efforts succeeded in alleviating but not offsetting the impact of the global crisis.
GDP contracted by 5.8 percent in 2009 mainly due to the contraction of external demand. While
the pace of decline moderated in the second half of 2009, negative feedback to the financial

sector from the deterioration of the real sector was likely to lead to much stronger risk aversion
thus postponing recovery towards second half of 20104. The recession resulted in a sharp
increase of the official unemployment rate from an average of 12.4 percent in 2008 to over 18
percent in the first quarter of 2010. This had surely reversed some of the achieved gains in
living standards during the boom years. The most affected were found to be younger and less
educated workers who suffered from high unemployment rates even before the crisis. With that
in mind, the authorities made efforts to strengthen targeting of social benefits and increase
allocation for unemployment benefits. An important factor that limited the employment impact
of the crisis has been wage moderation, which is a notable new phenomenon because until
recently wage pressures pervaded the Croatian economy and were contributing to high
unemployment. The informal sector also cushioned the adverse employment impact of the
crisis.
The Proposed Fiscal, Social and Financial Sector Development Policy Loan
The proposed Development Policy Loan (DPL) to the Republic of Croatia in the amount of
EUR200 million (US$296.75 million equivalent) was designed to support the Government's
efforts to address the impact of the global economic crisis. These efforts included measures
to (i) strengthen public finance, including through the reduction of the wage bill, social transfers
and investments, and improvements in the budgeting and strategic planning process; (ii)
strengthen the resilience and targeting of the social sector; and (iii) enhance the efficiency and
stability of the financial sector. The efforts focused largely on the short-term measures that
aimed to protect macroeconomic and social stability. At the same time, some of the measures
would contribute to (i) addressing the medium-term agenda of strengthening public finances
through rationalization of public expenditures in selected areas such as health, (ii) sharpening
the targeting of pensions and social assistance, (iii) improving public financial management and
public procurement, and (iv) improving financial intermediation.
The proposed reform program incorporated the findings and recommendations of a range
of ongoing lending and analytical and advisory services from the Bank, including a Public
Finance Review, an update of the Financial Sector Assessment Program, a Social Impact of the
Crisis, the TA for Financial Sector Second Generation Issues, and the ongoing Development of
Emergency Medical Services and Investment Planning project which supports the development
of the hospital master plan. The reform program was developed jointly with the Government,
and incorporated in the Government Strategy for 2010-2012, adopted in September 2009, which
laid out the country's comprehensive economic policy agenda in a volatile global environment.
The program was coordinated with other development partners, in particular with the European
Commission (EC) to ensure consistency with the EU accession requirements. In addition,
UNDP co-financed the assessment of the social impact of the crisis.

1.2. Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The objective of the DPL was to support the authorities' efforts in addressing the adverse
impact of the global crisis through (i) strengthened public finance; (ii) strengthened social
sector resilience, and (iii) enhanced efficiency and stability of financial sector.
The overall Project Key Outcome Indicators were set as follows:


      1. General Government wage bill reduced from 10.8% of GDP in the original budget for
         2009 to 10.2% of GDP in the 2010 Budget.

       spent on privileged pensions remained constant at 20% of overall pension spending in
       2010;
   3. General Government investments reduced from 5.2% of GDP in the original budget for
       2009 to 4.0% of GDP in the 2010 Budget;
   4. Total health sector arrears reduced by end-2009 to 1% of GDP and further in 2010;
   5. A 2010-2012 rolling budget consistent with the medium-term fiscal framework as
       measured by general government expenditures declining from 41.7% of GDP in 2009 to
       40.3% of GDP in 2010;
   6. An EU assessment suggesting completion of the legislative alignment of the public
       procurement system and further enhancement of administrative capacity;
   7. Adequate budget for unemployment benefits and means-tested social support allowance
       maintained at about 0.5% of GDP in the 2010 Budget;
   8. Interagency coordination on financial crisis preparedness and management tested on
       several cases.
   9. Capital adequacy ratio increased to above 16% by end-2009.
   10. Audit reports of investment firms containing detailed risk exposures.
These same Key Outcome Indicators can also be found in the "Targets" column of the DPL
Policy Matrix in Annex 2 of this document.

1.3. Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification
The PDO was not revised.

1.4. Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program
The ten policy measures and actions to achieve objectives supported by the DPL were grouped
in three pillars, each of which comprised one or more reform areas:
Pillar I ­Strengthening public finance through:
Rationalization of Public Expenditures
       (i) Public sector employment freeze and wages reduced by 6 percent in 2009 and kept
           frozen in the draft Law on Budget for 2010-2012 submitted to the Parliament for
           enactment.
       (ii) Pension indexation suspended in 2010 and privileged pensions of MPs, Government
            members and Constitutional Court Judges reduced by 10 percent.
       (iii) Public investment spending program rationalized in 2009 and in the draft Budget
             2010-2012 submitted to the Parliament for enactment.
       (iv) Co-payments and supplementary health-insurance premiums increased, sick leaves
            and cost of drugs reduced, and health insurance contributions extended to pension
            benefits through the implementation of the Compulsory Health Insurance and
            Voluntary Health Insurance Laws.
Strengthening of Public Financial Management
       (v) The first 3-year rolling budget for 2010-2012 submitted to the Parliament for
           enactment, in line with the government medium-term strategic and macroeconomic
           framework, under the terms of the new Organic Budget Law.
Strengthening of Public Procurement System




                                             3
          (vi) The draft State Commission for the Supervision of Public Procurement Procedures
               Act submitted to the Parliament for enactment to complete the legislative alignment
               of the public procurement system with the acquis communautaire.
Pillar II ­ Strengthening social sector resilience and targeting through:
Protecting Vulnerable Groups
           (i) Adequate funding ensured in the draft Budget 2010-2012 submitted to the
               Parliament for enactment to cover the anticipated rise in new claimants for
               unemployment benefits and social support allowances.
Pillar III ­ Enhancing the efficiency and stability of the financial sector through:
Heightening Crisis Readiness
           (i) A system for interagency coordination on financial crisis preparedness and
               management introduced through the signing of an MoU among the MoF, CNB and
               HANFA.
Formulating a Comprehensive Regulatory Framework for Financial Institutions
           (ii) New risk management rules for credit institutions that comply with the three Basel II
                 pillars incorporated through the implementation of the Credit Institutions Act.
           (iii) Supervision of securities market and investment services upgraded to meet Basel II
                 standards through the implementation of the Capital Market Act.
The measures supported were in line with the policy actions proposed by the Government's
Economic Council in its anti-recessionary program adopted in April 2009. They were also
aligned with the Government's medium term agenda laid out in Government strategic
documents5 and supported by the dynamics of the intensive EU integration and broad
consultative/consensus building processes involved in achieving the medium-term goals as
outlined in the DPL Policy Matrix (see Annex 2, last column of the matrix).

1.5. Revised Policy Areas
Policy areas were not revised.

1.6. Other significant changes
There were no other significant changes in the design, scope and scale, implementation
arrangements and schedule, or funding allocations.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1. Program Performance
This section assesses Program Performance from a legal point of view. Section 3 contains a
discussion and assessment of Program Performance more from the point of outcomes achieved.
The Fiscal, Social and Financial DPL was a single tranche operation. All conditions were met
on time as planned and the tranche was released on February 23, 2010. An Implementation
Status and Results Report (ISR) was prepared on April 26, 2010 and the loan was closed on its
original Closing Date of April 30, 2010.

2.2. Major Factors Affecting Implementation
Program Content. Policy actions in the program supported by the DPL were mainly of a short-
term nature and were oriented towards managing the impact of the global economic crisis. They
were targeted at: (1) minimizing the impact of recession-induced drop-off in revenues on the
country's budget deficit; (2) ensuring that even within thus constrained budget deficit, funds
were available to cover the anticipated rise in new claims for unemployment benefits and social
support allowances; and (3) strengthening the financial sector legal framework while at the
same time improving coordination among the various institutions in charge of regulating the
financial institutions that were exposed to increased levels of risk due to the deteriorated
external environment. While measures under (1) and (2) clearly had a shorter term horizon (with
most expenditure restraints under (1) scheduled to expire by early 2011), measures under (3) are
also important in the longer run.
Political Pressures. While all the policy actions had been taken by the time the DPL was
approved by the Bank's Board (the operation was "backward looking" by design), they were by
no means politically easy. Except for agriculture subsidies, there were cut-backs across all
spending categories, including a roll-back on earlier granted increases in public sector salaries,
cutbacks on salaries of highly remunerated officials, freezes on pensions, reductions in social
benefits in the health sector, education, in the replacement rate for unemployment, as well as
cuts in infrastructure investments. These were also coupled with the introduction of a solidarity
tax and an administrative fee on revenues from mobile telephony as well as increase in existing




                                                      6
taxes (VAT, excises). Overall, the measures reduced government expenditures in 2009 by about
2.1 percent of GDP and increased revenues by some 0.4 percent of GDP6.
On March 19, 2010, the team received information that an additional payment of called
guarantees for shipyards amounting to 0.6 percent of GDP had been made in late 2009.
Although this would have had no impact on prior actions or the main body of the DPL's
Program Document, as fiscal deficit numbers were presented according to the national
methodology, the Consolidated General Government deficit according to the GFS86
methodology would have changed. More importantly this is an indication that the Government
continues to have a hard time reining in and keeping track of subsidies in the politically
sensitive sectors that have been the hardest to reform (like state-owned shipyards, railways and
other public sector entities). These sectors continue to have the potential to undermine the
government's fiscal policy.
EU Accession Process. The EU accession process has been a critical motivating force behind
the implementation of the reform program. In the absence of a follow-on Bank budget support
operation, it will be easily the strongest set of incentives for Croatia to continue its reform
efforts. The latest 2009 EU progress Report is generally positive, with the weaker areas being
some of the structural reforms that would improve the competitiveness and flexibility of the
Croatian economy (crucial for rapid and sustainable long-run growth) as well as the areas of
justice and anti-corruption. Some concern was also expressed about pronounced weaknesses in
the professional skills and knowledge of the civil servants at all levels which has potentially
negative implications for the speed and quality of implementation of the Government's reform
efforts across the board.
IMF Program. The last program with the IMF, a Precautionary Stand-by Arrangement (SBA),
ended in November 2006 on a lapse basis. No drawings were needed under the SBA, and since
external debt began to stabilize, the government did not see a need for a subsequent
arrangement. Since the SBA, the IMF has conducted regular surveillance missions and
consultations under Article IV. For the purposes of the DPL, the IMF provided the Bank with an
Assessment Letter (Annex 3 of the DPL Board document), based on the findings of an IMF staff
visit to Zagreb during October 14-19, 2009. At the time, the next Article IV mission was
expected to take place in June 2010. In the event, it took place in April of 2010. Its Concluding
Statement was posted on the IMF website on June 15, 20107.
Collaboration with other donors. In addition to collaborating with EU and IMF, the Bank has
been cooperating with the UN agencies such as UNDP and UNHCR which continue to focus on
economic and social revitalization. This included an assessment of the social and labor market
impact of the crisis conducted under a joint cooperation agreement with UNDP.
Relationship to other Bank operations. The Social Welfare Development Project (SWDP),
approved by the Bank in 2004, aims to improve the quality and efficiency of social services.
The Revenue Administration Modernization Project, approved in May 2007, is helping to
strengthen revenue collection and tax administration, and thus also the budget management and
fiscal adjustment. The Development of Emergency Medical Services and Investment Planning
project, approved in September 2008, supports supply-side reforms by developing restructuring
plans for health care facilities and human resources through the development of a health
facilities master-plan. Finally, the Croatia Export Finance Intermediation Loan, approved by the
Board in August 2009, supports the Government's objective of maintaining a steady flow of
credit to the private sector.

Lessons Learned. A number of lessons relevant for the design of the DPL emerged from the
CAS Completion Report and the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for PALs 1 and 2.
Perhaps the most important was that the "stretch" goals of the PAL programmatic loan series
were so ambitious and of such wide scope that full implementation of the reforms had proven
difficult. Going forward, it was agreed that Croatia's reforms may be better supported by
development policy lending that focuses on a more narrowly defined agenda based on past
performance. The design of the DPL was fully aligned with that recommendation.
Analytical Underpinnings of the Program. The DPL relied on an extensive portfolio of
analytical work that covered all aspects of the DPL. The reports prepared by the Bank included:
(1) Restructuring Public Finance to Sustain Growth and Improve Public Services; (ii) ROSC ­
Corporate Governance; (iii) Financial System Stability Assessment ­ Update (with IMF); (iv)
Regional Study on Performance-Based Budgeting; (v) Croatia's Convergence Report ­
Reaching and Sustaining Higher Rates of Economic Growth; (vi) Institutional Framework and
Fiscal Risk Assessment for Public Private Partnerships (PPPs); (vii) Crisis Impact on Poverty
and Labor Markets (with UNDP); and (viii) Informal work on pensions.
Coordination Arrangements. The DPL agenda was coordinated by the State Secretary and
Director for International Financial Institutions in the Ministry of Finance. This included
coordination among various ministries and agencies, which proven to be effective. The overall
government reform program was overseen by the Government, led by the Prime Minister.

2.3. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
The main reform areas were presented in a Policy Matrix which specified the policy areas,
measures to be taken, baseline values, targets to be reached and medium term outcomes. Targets
to be reached were mostly quantified. In the few cases where they were not, expected qualitative
outcomes were specified. Medium term outcomes, while clearly falling well beyond the horizon
of the operation, provided a strategic framework for short-term targets.

2.4. Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):
At the time of writing the report, the government has verbally requested a follow-on operation.
A prolonged recession, due to delayed recovery of the main trading partners as well as existing
structural weaknesses, led the government to adopt the Economic Recovery Program (ERP) in
April 2010. Among else, the reforms outlined in the Medium-Term Policies and Outcomes
column in the Policy Matrix have been enlisted among the short-term policy actions in the
Government program and therefore proved relevant and confirmed the sustained commitment.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1. Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Objectives of the DPL. The reform program supported by the DPL was built on three pillars
covering crisis mitigation measures: (i) public finance strengthening; (ii) social sector resilience
and targeting; and (iii) efficiency and stability of the financial sector. The measures supported
were in line with the policy actions proposed by the Government's Economic Council in its
anti-recessionary program adopted in April 2009.
The DPL program focused largely on the short-term measures that aim to protect
macroeconomic and social stability in response to the crisis through fiscal consolidation, efforts
to protect the vulnerable, and the measures to improve the efficiency of the financial sector in
crisis preparedness and management.




                                                 8
At the same time, some of the measures supported by this loan were expected to contribute to
addressing the medium-term reform agenda of improving financial intermediation and
strengthening public finances through rationalization of public expenditures in selected areas
such as health, privileged pensions and social assistance (through better targeting),
improvements in public financial management and public procurement.
Tables 2 through 4 in the next section summarize the reform areas and key actions covered
under each of the three "pillars". The specific reforms supported in each area are also available
in the Government's Letter of Development Policy8 and in the DPL policy matrix9. These reform
efforts are in line with the medium-term reform agenda laid out in Government's strategic
documents, supported as well by the dynamics of EU integration and the broad consultative
process involved.
The fact that the DPL was designed as a "one-tranche" operation based on actions taken prior to
the approval of the DPL by the World Bank's Board was based on the experience with the two
PALs (see section 2.2 above under Lessons Learned)

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

Overall Program Development Objectives (PDOs) and Macro-Economic Framework
The PDOs of the DPL were appropriate (see Program Content under 2.2 above). The
measures undertaken were targeted at mitigating some of the effects of the global economic
crisis, while preserving stability and laying some of the groundwork for growth-supporting
medium-term reforms.
The macroeconomic framework at appraisal was adequate10. Fiscal pressures were
moderated by three successive swift budget revisions in the course of 2009. They helped contain
headline fiscal deficit numbers, particularly compared with Croatia's EU peers, and maintained
access to market financing. However, given that in October 2009 it was not clear how long the
recession would continue, fiscal risks were judged to be an important consideration going
forward. General government debt at 34 percent of GDP was moderate, but it would reach 50
percent of GDP when contingent liabilities were included. Finally, Croatia had a substantial
amount of foreign private debt, large part of which had to be rolled over.
The IMF considered the planned fiscal consolidation in 2010 and beyond to be "challenging"
since many of the measures taken to control the deficit in 2009 and 2010 were short term, set to
expire in 2011. They would have to be replaced by the long-lasting measures, in particularly in
the case of postponed recovery and weaker growth than before the crisis. If such an eventuality
occurs, it would be very difficult to improve the various debt indicators.
The IMF concurred with the assessment in the Program Document that the strong pre-crisis
growth has been more the result of strong consumption and growth in nontradable goods and
services, neither of which were sustainable in the long run. What was needed was a strong push
on structural reforms in improving the business environment, through governance reforms and
privatization; increasing the contribution of labor to growth by addressing skill mismatches and
advancing the flexibility in the labor market; as well as deepening trade integration and
supporting innovation11, which was also indicated in the Program Document.
Such measures were not directly part of the package supported by the DPL, although they were
clearly a part of the ongoing EU Accession Program. Nevertheless, the Program Document

clearly pointed to the "urgent driving out the important" indicating that a quick rebound to pre-
crisis growth rates is unlikely if not accompanied by structural reforms to strengthen the
competitiveness of the economy. While this DPL secured timely financial support in
particularly severe times for the government short-term program which was by no means
politically easy to implement, it would be important to focus any new policy operation on the
important structural reforms that would reinvigorate growth and support its sustainability. In
this context, although the Government's reluctance to have any further IMF arrangements is
understandable since reasonable market access to finance was available to Croatia, it might have
been useful for cushioning the impact of the 2010 Greek and "euro" crises while going through
the implementation of its 2010 Economic Recovery Program (ERP).

Pillar I: Strengthening Public Finance
Public expenditures rationalized. Rationalization of public expenditures was to be achieved
through the following policy actions (see Table 2 below): (i) a public sector employment freeze,
a reduction of public employee's wages in 2009 (actually a rescinding of an agreed increase of 6
percent earlier in the year) and kept frozen in the draft Law on Budget for 2010-12 submitted
for enactment to the Parliament; (ii) pension indexation suspended in 2010 and privileged
pensions of MPs, Government members and Constitutional Court Judges reduced by 10 percent;
(iii) public investment spending program rationalized in 2009 and in the draft Law on Budget
2010-2012 submitted to the Parliament for enactment; and (iv) co-payments and supplementary
health-insurance premiums increased, sick leaves and the cost of drugs reduced, and health
insurance contributions extended to pension benefits through the implementation of the
Compulsory Health Insurance and Voluntary Health Insurance Laws.
These were all areas that have been, and will continue to be, problematic. Croatia's wage bill, as
a proportion of its GDP, at around 10 percent, has been consistently higher than that of most of
its comparators. Total pension payments, at 10 percent of GDP, have also been high, in
particular when compared with the Croatia's peers, and had become unaffordable given the
overall budget constraint. Public investments had been high and authorities decided to delay
some of them or cut them out entirely where the prospective rates of return were low (some road
and railroad investments). Croatian health system, while showing good outcomes, at 9 percent
of GDP has been expensive relative to the comparators. Moreover, very little of it (perhaps no
more than 1.5-2.0 percent of GDP) until 2009 was privately financed. Thus rationalization
efforts in these areas were needed. Most of the actions supported by the DPL have the potential
of improving sustainability of the policy framework in their respective areas.

All the policy actions were taken. The expected (short-term) outcomes of the actions were
achieved when measured against the Targets (see Target column of Table 2 above).
In terms of Medium Term Policies and Outcomes, outlined in the last column of Table 2, the
progress has been made in the areas of public finance management, procurement as well as
health sector. Centralized public procurement has been introduced for selected goods and
service categories; the new strategic government program to be accompanied with the medium-
term 2011-2013 budget contains performance indicators launching the performance budgeting;
the public investment planning framework has been strengthened with the new decree on
appraisal techniques and investment decision-making processes, while the rationalization of
health copayment exemptions reduced the number of exempt by some further 10 percent of
population.
There is also movement in the area of restructuring the hospital sector. This sector seems to be
very inefficient, implying that major efficiency gains are possible. For example, the Zagreb area
has 17 hospitals (as compared to say 3 for Ljubljana or 9 for all of Austria), absorbing roughly
fifty percent of hospital care budget in Croatia, and one-fourth of overall number of hospitals.
The MoHSW has been determined to rationalize the hospital network, with Zagreb area
hospitals administratively merged into three from July 2010. The sick leave approval process
has been put under the stricter control with the sick leave rate declining by 20 percent in 2009
and further in 2010 as has the overall cost of drugs (mainly by consolidating procurement and
negotiating lower prices). Health sector arrears have been further reduced in early 2010 by
additional 0.1 percent of GDP.
On the other side, rationalization of public administration remains high on the agenda. The
Government Economic Recovery Program announced a 5-percent reduction in public
administration employment by end-2010. The current rule applied is "two for one" ­ one newly
employed replacing two current civil servants. A declining wage bill as a proportion of GDP,
however, will be harder to achieve since there are indications that the 2010 growth will be flat,
and the recovery, when it comes, could be anemic. There are also indications that despite the
wage freeze there was a small rise in education sector wages, but also the overall wage bill
given new employment under the EU accession requirements. The Government will thus need
to take even tougher measures, both in terms of controlling expenditures on wages as well as in
pursuing structural reforms that would increase future GDP growth, if it is to achieve its
medium-term goal of a declining wage bill relative to GDP.
Pension reform is also on track and amendments to the Law on Obligatory Pension Insurance
are submitted to the Parliament for enactment. The amendments to the law very much follow
the measures outlined in the Medium-Term Policies column. In addition they contain financial
incentives for people to delay retirement. The privileged pensions have been further reduced (by
10 percent) from July 2010, while the ERP aims to review the policy of various privileged
pensions and their gradual convergence (at least somewhat) towards the general pension system.
Overall, the outcomes in the reform area of "public expenditures rationalized" are deemed to be
moderately satisfactory as further reform efforts to support short-term measures taken are yet
to be implemented.
Public finance management strengthened. The policy in this area was to prepare and submit
the first 3-year rolling budget for 2010-2012 to the Parliament for enactment, consistent with the
government medium-term strategic and macroeconomic framework, under the terms of the new
Organic Budget Law.

Croatian planning in the past was mainly done through annual budgets and hence tended to
focus on the immediate issues. Hence, there was little consideration of what is "coming down
the road" a year or two ahead and what could be done now to prepare for it. The budget
planning process was also characterized by an over-fragmentation of expenditures over
hundreds of programs which were difficult to monitor and evaluate. However, the new approach
aims to improve the strategic focus of Croatia's public finance management, making it more far-
sighted, flexible and efficient.
The proposed prior action in the area of "public finance management strengthened" was taken
and there is an indication of further progress in streamlining and strengthening budgetary
processes (through implementation of performance budgeting and integration of FMIS). The
outcomes in this reform area are satisfactory.
Public procurement system strengthened. The policy action in this area was to submit the draft
State Commission for the Supervision of Public Procurement Procedures Act to Parliament for
enactment to complete the legislative alignment of the public procurement system with the EU
acquis communautaire.
Croatian experts have been working for some years on improving this area and this action is
meant to complete Croatia's alignment with EU laws and procedures in the area of procurement.
It has also broadened the supervision over the concessions and other PPPs. In addition, the
authorities adopted the Action Plan which goes beyond the targeted accession date and aims to
strengthen the capacity of internal auditors, anti-corruption office USKOK, state attorney
offices and private sector in the area of public procurement. So far, the Ministry of Economy,
Labor and Entrepreneurship certified over 1,600 contracting authorities through the specialized
program for procurement practitioners.
The prior action in this area was taken. Another confirmation of the progress made in this area
came from the provisional closure of the Chapter 5 of the EU acquis on procurement in June
2010. Apart from the considerable progress made on the training front, the authorities have also
stepped up their efforts to punish malfeasance and strengthen the risk-based assessment.
Furthermore, in early 2010, the government decided to centralize purchasing of some of the
goods and services common to all public administration offices. Simulations, based on data
from other countries, suggest that cost reductions in the purchases of goods and services of as
much as 20 percent are possible. This could translate into 0.2 percent of GDP per annum for the
central government institutions only. The outcomes in the area of "strengthening the
procurement system" are highly satisfactory.

Pillar II: Strengthening Social Sector Resilience
Vulnerable groups protected. The policy action in this area (see Table 3 below) was to ensure
adequate funding in the draft Law on Budget for 2010-2012 submitted to the Parliament for
enactment to cover the anticipated rise in new claimants for unemployment benefits and social
support allowances.
The crisis has resulted in a substantial number of people needing some sort of assistance, and
the numbers of the people affected by the crisis have turned out to be higher than initially
expected. The simulations12 indicate that the fall in labor demand engendered by the crisis and
the associated increase in unemployment have had a significant impact on poverty in Croatia.
Assuming baseline poverty rate of 10 percent, simulation results suggest that the poverty
headcount rate increased by about 3.5 percentage points. Croatia's system provides a relatively
effective, if costly, safety net for the poor and vulnerable. Out of 3.2 percent of GDP allocated

for non-contributory social benefits, only 7 percent of total goes for means-tested benefits13. The
authorities have taken measures in 2009 to improve targeting (and reduce the error of inclusion)
through strengthening the income test and even eliminate some of the categorical benefits.
There have been important savings in the area of benefits for war veterans. A part of that has
come through the reduction of benefits during 2009 and continuing into this year, while another
(and significant) part has come from better methods of assessment, both of disabilities and of
the assets and/or other incomes of the beneficiaries. However, further room for improvements
remains.
One of the big issues is the treatment of disabled. Just in the past two years, the number of those
classified as disabled had risen from 9.7 percent of the population to 11.7 percent. This is well
out of line with comparator countries. The problem seems to lie in the way disabilities are
defined, with a tendency to add up the various disabilities, rather than assess the functionality of
the person in his/her ability to handle situation in his/her personal and work lives. There are also
inconsistencies in assessments across institutions involved in doing assessments. The authorities
have indicated under the ERP that they aim to improve the methods of assessment and
consolidate the number of assessment services. Significant resource savings in this area should
be possible, but more importantly to prevent further deterioration in the labor force participation
rate which is the second lowest across the EU countries.

some cases half the cost of the benefit. If the efforts that are underway to reduce fragmentation,
consolidate benefits, and improve targeting succeed, important efficiency gains could be made.
The prior action was taken and arrears had been eliminated. The medium-term agenda is being
pursued. The outcomes in the area of protecting vulnerable groups (within tighter budget
constraints) are satisfactory.

Pillar III: Enhancing Efficiency and Stability of the Financial Sector
Heightened crisis readiness. The policy action in this area was to introduce a system for
interagency coordination on financial crisis preparedness and management through the signing
of an MoU among the MoF, CNB and HANFA.
Croatia's financial sector proved resilient through the crisis. This was in part due to strong
participation of large foreign banks, active supervision and countercyclical policy measures
undertaken by the CNB, as well as a timely response of the authorities at the outbreak of the

crisis (including raising the threshold on the insured private deposits). But the system was
prepared in other ways, too. Stress tests were run by the CNB which showed that the banking
sector was resilient to a plausible variety of macroeconomic shocks. Also, a series of
recommendations of the joint WB-IMF FSAP Update had been taken into account by the
authorities (see Table 2 of World Bank 2009b). However, all of these actions were taken in the
absence of a formal coordination mechanism among the various institutions involved. The MoU
was expected to remedy that.

It seems that while the MoU was signed, there has not been a formal follow-up in the sense of
the MoF convening the three institutions, electing a secretary and proceeding as specified in the
MoU. The reason seems to be that there is no felt need for it at the moment. All three
institutions said that their collaboration along the previously established channels remains good,
that the relevant data are being passed along expeditiously and that in general what needs doing
is being done.
The MoU among the three institutions was signed on November 20, 2009, so the prior action
was taken as agreed. The needed exchanges of information are taking place. The CNB and
HANFA cross-border cooperation is also going on, with joint visits and exchanges of
information. The outcomes in the area of "heightened crisis readiness" are satisfactory.
Comprehensive regulatory framework for financial institutions formulated. There were two
policy actions in this area: (i) New risk management rules for credit institutions that comply
with the three Basel II pillars were incorporated through the implementation of the Credit
Institutions Act; and (ii) Supervision of securities market and investment services was upgraded
to meet Basel II standards through the implementation of the Capital Market Act.

The Credit Institutions Act is meant to help the credit institutions adjust their operations to the
Basel II capital requirements, This was somewhat tricky as there are ongoing changes in this
area at the level of the EU. On-site examination in December 2009 led to an increase in
provisioning to mitigate the rising non-performing loans which, in March 2010, stood at above
9 percent. After the full compliance with the Basel II requirements the capital adequacy rate
stood at 19 percent in March 2010, much above the end-2009 16.4 percent due to less strict risk
weights than under the old rules. The CNB remains active in colleges of supervisors for the EU
banking groups.
The Capital Market Act is meant to improve supervision of the securities market and investment
services. There has been progress in the securities and investment services area. HANFA now
regularly produces risk assessments of the institutions in its area of supervision, while the audit
reports of investment firms contain detailed risk exposure information. The methods are being
refined through assistance from peer institutions in neighboring countries and Germany.
The policy actions in the two policy areas were taken. There has been further progress on the
medium-term agenda since then. Consumer credits have been regulated through the enacted
Consumer Credit Act, while the initial risk-based supervision in being undertaken for non-
banking institutions. The outcomes in the area of formulating a comprehensive regulatory
framework for financial institutions are satisfactory.

3.4. Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
The macroeconomic environment in which the operation took place was adequate and the rating
of outcomes under each of the Pillars was satisfactory. The overall outcome rating is therefore
satisfactory.
With prior actions having been taken before the operation was approved by the Board, the
operation in the legal sense was satisfactory by design. Prior actions were taken and although
some of them were undoubtedly politically difficult, they were mostly focused on the short
term. Some of them, however, have the potential of leading to desirable medium term outcomes,
but it would not be this DPL that provided the critical push behind the reform program. Rather,
this would be provided by the need to act given the crisis situation and by the dynamics of the
EU accession process. Progress has also been made on the unfinished PAL agenda. For
example, privatization tenders have been issued for all six shipyards, the last agricombinat
(Vupik) has been privatized, and the railways have been making some progress on their
restructuring agenda. FSAP measures, some of which had yet to be taken when the DPL went to
the Board (see Table 7 of World Bank 2009b) have now been taken. And the reform programs
in sectors like health, pensions and social assistance continued (see previous section).
Other indications of the pressure to implement structural reforms are evident in the
Government's Economic Reform Program, including policies of fiscal consolidation (bringing
down the expenditures to GDP ratio, as well as reducing the budget deficit), improving
investment climate and making the labor market more flexible. There is also much emphasis on
changing behaviors14. The ERP emphasizes that a successful transformation of the economy
requires significant changes of behavior of all players ­ public sector, private companies, and
the general population.

The horizon of the DPL was too short for the operation to have an identifiable impact on
growth, poverty, gender, or social development. One could, of course, speculate about the
longer run impact of the operation, and that should be positive, given that the ultimate aim of
the program was to carry a fiscal consolidation and implement competitiveness enhancing
micro-economic reforms that would foster broad-based growth.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
It would be hard to attribute much institutional change to the DPL; however, the strengthened
legislative framework will certainly lead to institutional change over the medium term.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)
None.

3.6. Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Beneficiaries were not surveyed and there was no stakeholder workshop.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcomes
Rating: Significant
Economic risks. The recession in Croatia is turning out to be longer and deeper than expected
at the time the DPL was approved. There are further risks to the near-term outlook due to rising
fiscal concerns and sluggish EU recovery backed by high unemployment and the gradual
withdrawal of stimulus measures. With the situation in some of the EU countries and volatility
resulting from fears of contagion, the planned fiscal consolidation will be harder than previously
thought. This could jeopardize the medium-term macroeconomic and social outcomes.
Furthermore, given the high level of external debt, high degree of euroization (and the resulting
external exposure of the corporate sector), and high debt service requirements, the Croatian
financial sector remains vulnerable to exchange rate risks and to a slowdown of capital inflows.
Refinancing of external obligations may thus become challenging. Economic risks are
significant.
Political risks. Political risks are significant, as the coalition government has only a slim
majority in Parliament, and there is a mounting challenge from the unions on whether collective
agreements can be amended when circumstances change for the worse. The need to mitigate the
ongoing recession while at the same time implementing a fairly broad medium-term reform
agenda in a difficult economic environment is likely to strain the coalition, with uncertain
impact on the reform agenda. Even the prospect of EU accession may not suffice to overcome
these strains.
Fiduciary risks. Much has been accomplished in Croatia in the area of public financial
management, including in procurement. Croatia has made progress in government budget
transparency. It makes audit reports public (although enforcement of the audit recommendations
remains modest). There is broad compliance with the IPSAS standards with respect to
accounting and reporting for the public sector. And the budget execution process has been
steadily strengthened. The fiduciary risk is moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1. Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: satisfactory


                                               17
The operation was well designed. The issues covered were less ambitious in scope, in line
with a lesson learned from the PAL series. Despite selectivity, policy actions did manage to
cover many of the important issues that had a reasonable chance of leading to medium-term
fiscal consolidation, while protecting those most affected by the global economic crisis. They
also covered some important issues in the financial sector that would heighten crisis
preparedness and the legislative framework.
The DPL Policy Matrix was clear and brief. It indicated the actions to be taken and how success
would be measured in the short run (including baseline values of the indicators). The matrix
also specified expectations regarding medium-term outcomes. The text explaining these
outcomes was appropriately cautious, although the Bank could get some comfort from the fact
that Croatia was trying to do its best to fulfill all the conditions for EU accession as quickly as
possible, thus giving a boost to the reform momentum. The risks were laid out clearly, as were
the mitigating measures, building on the PAL experience. Bank's performance at entry was
satisfactory.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: highly satisfactory
This operation was well supervised. The person in charge of both the design and the
supervision of the DPL operation possesses deep knowledge of the Croatian economy as well as
details of various reform agendas, processes of achieving them, and the history of the reforms in
each area. The task leader also commands respect from the government counterparts and has
been able to draw on and use effectively specialist advice from within the Bank, as needed. The
operation ran on time, there were no changes, the supervision report was done on schedule and
the operation was closed, as scheduled, on April 30, 2010.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
Guidelines for ICR specify that in cases where one of the components is satisfactory (Quality
at Entry) while the other is highly satisfactory (Supervision), the overall rating has to be
satisfactory.

5.2. Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
Government agencies engaged in the DPL dialogue include the various ministries, Croatian
National Bank, HANFA, HZMO and HZZO that were involved in the three main reform areas
supported by the Fiscal, Social and Financial DPL. There was a sense of ownership of and
commitment to the implementation of the reform programs, tempered at times by the difficulty
of the measures being undertaken and hence the uncertainties of whether the decision makers
would be able to "stay with and lead the program". Implementation was moving smoothly, not
least because of the strong technical capacities of the staff involved. The counterparts, virtually
to a person, were well-informed, engaged in their respective areas and were at ease to provide
updates on the reform progress and outcomes. There were no complaints about coordination
issues across agencies. The performance of the Government has been satisfactory.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory




                                                18
The implementing agency was the Ministry of Finance (MoF). The MoF provided competent
coordination. It was aware of the entire range of issues supported by the FSF DPL. It also
showed ownership of and commitment to the reform program. The Ministry worked effectively
with the Bank at all stages of the DPL operation. The late reporting on called shipyard
guarantees to the Bank may be part of the somewhat confusing array of budget deficits reported
according to different methodologies. Needless to say, it would be good if a more unified
approach were adopted that would include various items (some of them quite significant) that
are at the moment often treated as off-budget, yet they draw on the public purse. The overall
performance of the MoF was satisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

6. Lessons Learned
Scope of the reform programs. The lesson from the PAL series was that a broad scope of
reforms (an ambitious program with "stretch" goals) may be too demanding and therefore risky.
This DPL solved the problem by narrowing the scope of the operation, having all the prior
actions carried out ahead of presenting the operation to the Board, and all funds disbursed in one
tranche. In a situation in which there is already steady pressure to reform in order to gain EU
accession, the approach taken by the DPL makes sense.
Fiscal consolidation is a medium-term process. This operation supported a budget which was
supposed to reduce expenditures as a share of GDP and reduce the budget deficit. While the
results are not yet in, it is not likely that the targets set in the 2010-12 budget framework for
2010, will be achieved. This will partly be due to the prolonged recession which reduced
nominal GDP in 2009 and is likely to keep it flat or falling in 2010, thus raising all quantities
measured as a proportion of GDP. It is also due to the difficulty of downsizing the government
sector and containing wage and pension bills, and various other costs. Nevertheless, the size of
government must be contained within an expenditure envelope that is at most 40 percent of
GDP, or else its financing will either increase external or internal debt (both of which can have
unpleasant consequences, particularly in the current environment). Financing through higher
taxes do damage to incentives, including keeping the grey economy large. The bottom line is
that fiscal consolidation in not an one-off process but will demand the attention of the policy
makers for years to come. Policy actions concerning the budget supported by an operation like
DPL are but a small step in the longer term process of fiscal consolidation.
Fiscal space and structural reforms. Croatia is in a tough fiscal position for a number of
reasons. There is the impact of recession, which is not of Croatia's own making. Second, the
tight managed float of the kuna vis-a-vis the euro conditioned by high euroization reduces the
maneuvering space for monetary policy and therefore makes immediate fiscal policy adjustment
even more necessary. Finally, precious time was lost with structural reforms before the
recession outbreak. It makes the necessary structural reforms (particularly in the labor market,
including the size of the public sector and social sectors) that much harder to carry out. Yet, it
must be done, in order to boost competitiveness, and increase the share of tradables in Croatia's
GDP thus putting future growth on a more sustainable footing. Growth would also make it
easier to carry out the fiscal consolidation in time for the next downturn in the economic cycle,
putting Croatia in a stronger position than during the recent crisis.
