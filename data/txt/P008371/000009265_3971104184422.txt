REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
TRANSPORT SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan No. 2906-CY)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
1.     This Transport Sector Development Project (TSDP) was the seventh and last loan to the transport
sector in Cyprus since 1973, and followed four highway projects and two port projects. It was also the
last lending operation before Cyprus graduated from Bank lending. Earlier projects were jointly financed
with the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAED) but in this project the financing was
provided entirely by the Bank and the Cyprus Government, together with some commercial borrowings.
2.     The project represented a continuation of the previous Bank support strategy to the sector,
focussing on strengthening and maintenance of the country's transport infrastructure. Considerable
emphasis was also placed on improving transport planning methodology and transport institutions.
However, unlike earlier projects the TSDP involved all modes and areas of transport in Cyprus, including
civil aviation for the first time. The project was largely successful in meeting its objectives, and
demonstrated the considerable advances achieved by the Cyprus authorities during its cooperation with
the Bank in transport planning and management. With regard to this, it is clear that graduation occurred
at an opportune time in relation to the level of the transport agencies' capabilities.
Project Objectives
3.     The project design built upon earlier Bank participation in the sector and was based upon the
1988-91 transport sector investment program. Its primary objectives were:
(a)    increasing the efficiency of the transport sector operating system;
(b)    improving cost recovery in revenue earning transport sector operations and in the
highway system;
(c)    enhancing the quality of transport planning and project implementation, including
attention being paid to environmental issues;
(d)    upgrading priority areas of the transport infrastructure to support economic growth and
social change in a cost effective way; and
(e)    increasing the extent and quality of training provided for personnel in the roads, road
transport and civil aviation sub-sectors.
4.     To support the achievement of these objectives the main project components were:
(a)    construction and improvement of priority road sections;
(b)    a road strengthening program of approximately 60 km;
(c)    improvements to the Public Works Department materials laboratory and the Nicosia
Higher Technical Institute training laboratory;


﻿iii
(d)    computerization of the vehicle licensing system;
(e)    improvement of Larnaca International Airport (LIA);
(f)    procurement of port equipment; and
(g)    provision of consultancy services to (i) carry out a feasibility study and design for LIA;
(ii) assist rationalization of rural bus services; (iii) undertake a study of road user
charges; (iv) prepare design and specification for computerized vehicle licensing system;
and (v) undertake the Larnaca transport study. Subsequently the LIA study was expanded
to include Paphos airport and a study to prepare a program for the preservation of Kato
Paphos archaeological site was added.
Implementation Experience and Results
5.     The project experienced some component changes during implementation. The biggest of these
was the removal of the Dhekelia - Aridhipou - LIA road from the loan (see Map). This occurred because
the Cyprus authorities wished to award a contract not in compliance with the Bank Procurement
Guidelines which was not acceptable to the Bank (the GOC eventually financed this project from its own
resources) and the funds were re-allocated, especially to the Kato Paphos archaeological site protection
and other priority roads. The Bank also decided against financing the final design of the LIA and Paphos
airports because of land acquisition difficulties. Despite these changes the project largely achieved its
objectives. The main road between Nicosia and Limassol was rehabilitated, the road strengthening
program was completed and resources allocated to road maintenance continue to be adequate. The
rationalization of the rural bus services was successful and the computerized vehicle licensing system is
about to become operational. The study of the feasibility of improvements to the two airports was
completed and the government is proceeding with final design and the identification of financing sources.
The port of Limassol was upgraded and studies are in hand to make recommendations on management
restructuring, and tariff revisions to take account of new technologies.
6.     The Government has shown its commitment to the project objectives in its operational plan for
the future, with some delays over the original timetable. In particular, the road user charges study has
been awarded, procurement of consultancy services to study port reorganization and port tariff review
is under way, and efforts are being made to re-instate the Transport Sector Planning and Project
Monitoring Unit. The twelve-month delay in project completion was largely due to delays in project
effectiveness, which took nearly a year, procurement delays and the addition to the project of the Kato
Paphos archaeological site protection work. The procurement process in all of Cyprus' public sector
agencies is very slow and the Bank has been unsuccessful in promoting changes to increase its efficiency,
as recommended in a study (May 1987) which identified ways in which it might be improved.
7.     The total project cost at appraisal was estimated at US$121 million with a loan amount of US$35
million. Estimated final project cost is of the order of US$140.0 million but the figures relating to non-
Bank financed components are not reliable: the Government has financed the cost overrun. At the request
of the Government US$5 million was cancelled from the loan and, at loan closure US$965,235 remained
undisbursed and was also cancelled.
8.     Owing to the modifications to the components of the project as appraised, comparisons of rates
of return are difficult to make. The Dhekelia - Aridhipou - LIA road comprising about 27% of final
estimated total project cost was the single largest component and this was deleted from the loan and
replaced by other roads and by the Kato Paphos archaeological site protection. Although the Dhekelia -
Aridhipou - LIA road remains to be completed and, consequently, an economic re-evaluation has not been
carried out, it is expected, taking into account the costs of the completed sections and the levels of traffic,


﻿iv
that the ERR will be in line with the 41 % estimated at appraisal. However, no final decision has yet been
taken over the location and design of the Aridhipou Junction with the Nicosia - Larnaca road and the
government should undertake a special feasibility study of this before proceeding with the works. The
remainder of the road construction and improvement component, comprising about 22% of total project
cost has been re-evaluated yielding an ERR of about 48%, compared with 58.8% estimated at appraisal.
The road strengthening program comprising about 11 % of total project cost was required to yield at least
an ERR of 12%; the re-evaluated ERRs exceed 20%, and the overall rate of return for the road
component has been re-evaluated at about 41 %.
Summary of Findings and Key Lessons Learned
9.     In summary, the project was well designed in relation to the stage of development of the
transport sector in Cyprus, was successfully implemented, achieved the high ERR expected at
appraisal and, given the Government's continued commitment, is likely to be sustainable.
10.    This was the seventh and final transport project of the Bank's twenty-five year involvement in
Cyprus. Whilst all objectives have not been achieved, the advances in planning and managing the
transport sector have been significant and, from this point of view, graduation has come at the right
time. However, there are still lessons to be learned and issues to be addressed.
For the Government:
(a)    Procurement procedures are slow and costly and should be improved. Whilst it is
unlikely that procurement procedures will be significantly amended, and they have the
merit of transparency, there should be scope to update financial thresholds at which
certain actions have to be taken. Also, the influence on implementation of existing
procurement procedures should have been built into project scheduling.
(b)    Greater autonomy should be given by supervising ministries to the executing and
revenue earning entities. In particular (and as was identified in the ICR on the Fourth
Highway Project), non-technical agencies should not be allowed to influence day to
day management of technical matters. Currently this is a source of considerable
delays and increased costs.
(c)    There should be greater public participation at an earlier stage in the planning process,
especially where land acquisition is involved.
For the Bank:
a)     The Bank can make an effective contribution to institutional reform only through a
series of projects and with a willing partner. However as a country approaches
graduation, the Bank's leverage declines. For this reason, initiatives which were
embraced by the Borrower at appraisal in 1987, such as procurement reform, were
not carried through.
b)     Project supervision should pay greater attention to the policy components which are
important even though the amount of finding allocated is low.
c)     By showing flexibility the Bank was able to help the Borrower reallocate funds from a
component unlikely to make progress to a new component of international importance
(Paphos Mosaics).

﻿IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
TRANSPORT SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 2906-CY)
PART I. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
Project Review from Bank's Perspective
1.     Project Objectives
1.01     This project, which was financed by the Government of Cyprus (GOC) and the World Bank,
was the Bank's seventh in the transport sector; the previous projects consisting of two ports projects and
four highway projects. It was also the last transport project as Cyprus has since graduated from Bank
borrowing.
1.02     The objectives as defined at appraisal were:
(a) increasing the efficiency of the transport sector operating system;
(b) improving cost recovery in highways and revenue earning transport sector operations,
especially ports and civil aviation;
(c) enhancing the quality of transport planning and project implementation, including
improving the attention being paid to environmental issues;
(d) upgrading priority areas of the transport infrastructure to support economic growth and
social objectives in a cost effective way; and
(e) extending and improving the quality of training provided for staff in the roads, road
transport and civil aviation subsectors.
1.03     The basic philosophy of the project was to continue to provide the support of earlier projects
in the roads and ports sub-sectors by funding investment in priority and economically justified
infrastructure projects, the maintenance of roads, and to promote institutional improvements. Added to
this, the project set out to address important issues in the civil aviation sub-sector in response to the
growth in air traffic. It was also considered important, in view of the sector nature of the project, and
in view of Cyprus' imminent graduation from Bank lending, to emphasize the need for multi-mode
planning, development and operation coordination, and a continuation of sound project evaluation that
took adequate account of environmental factors.
1.04     In support of these objectives the project, as appraised, was to finance:
Highways Sector
(a) construction of the 23 km Dhekelia-Aridhipou-Larnaca International Airport (LIA) road;
(b) other economically justified road improvement schemes;
(c) road pavement strengthening;


﻿2
(d) construction and equipping the MCW and National Higher Technical Institute materials
laboratories; and
(e) highway management equipment to support the Road Maintenance Management System
(RMMS) set up under the Third and Fourth Highway Projects (Loans 2128-CY and
2684-CY).
Road Transport
(a) renewal of rural bus fleet;
(b) rationalization of rural bus services which was a follow-up on earlier Government actions
to ensure development of public transport to match changing economic and social
conditions; and
(c) computerization of the vehicle licensing and regulation system.
Civil Aviation
(a) preparation of a master plan for LIA;
(b) completion of final design and tender documents and construction for LIA improvements;
and
(c) procurement of equipment for civil aviation.
Ports Sector
(a) container handling equipment; and
(b) other port equipment.
1.05     The project also allowed for technical assistance, studies and training in all sectors. The
studies, in addition to those mentioned above, included:
(a) Paphos Archaeological Site Improvement Plan;
(b) Transport Study of Larnaca;
(c) Landscape Plan for Kato Paphos Archaeological Site;
(d) Technical Assistance for Regional Bus Companies; and
(e) Road User Charges Study.
1.06     Although the project was relatively complex this did not in itself lead to problems. However,
procurement procedures in Cyprus remain slow and cumbersome, and there is frequent day to day
influence on technical executing agencies by non-technical government organizations which makes
programming and planning difficult, leading to often serious delays. Despite efforts on the part of the
Bank to make procedures more efficient it is unlikely that this position will improve and delays will
continue to lead to higher costs and lost benefits. At the same time it must be said that procurement


﻿3
procedures are transparent, deeply set in the culture of the country and never involve only a single
ministry. Although the authorities accepted Bank Guidelines on procurement, there were occasions when
Government wished to adopt different procedures and accepted the consequence of foregoing Bank
finance: this was the case with the section of road from Dhekelia to Aridhipou which the authorities
wished to award on a basis of negotiation with a single contractor and which Government eventually
financed in its entirety.
2.       Achievement of Project Objectives
2.01     The project, despite some delays and modifications, was largely successful, and the MCW has
significantly improved its capability and standards of investment planning, project management and
infrastructure maintenance, compared with twenty-five years ago when the Bank started to lend to the
sector. Not only do all investment projects have to meet strict economic criteria and be clearly related
to economic and social needs, but environmental criteria are given very high priority. This is reflected
in the support given to the Kato Paphos archaeological site and the abandonment of road construction
schemes in the Tillyria area and costly realignment of the Limassol-Paphos motorway because of potential
environmental damage. Institutional reform has been the weakest aspect of the project, especially
regarding the restructuring of port operations and the lack of autonomy in the civil aviation sub-sector,
but even here progress is being made.
2.02     The progress of the project components is described below. In summary (with reference to
para. 1.02) the increase in efficiency of the transport system (para. 1.02 (a)) was less than that anticipated
at Appraisal because of Government's failure to properly set up the TSPPMU. Improvements in port
operations and in the amalgamation into larger units of local bus companies has improved efficiency.
Objective 1.02 (b)) will be achieved in the highway field through the Road User Charges study which
was not complete at the time of loan closure, and possibly by a port tariff increase now before Parliament
(see Table 10) which would be in addition to a 30 percent increase in 1992. Objective 1.02 (c) was met
by measures described above and by creating an office of the project coordinator in MCW, which
maintained good contacts with other agencies throughout the project, including DPW, which as part of
MCW, implemented the physical elements of the project.   The Government adopted stringent
environmental review procedures which was applied in the later years of the project (see para 2.01).
Objective 1.02 (d) was achieved through the choice of road schemes, while 1.02 (e) was achieved mainly
through courses at NHTI and CPA's own internal training program. Details are given below.
Highway Sector
(a)    The construction of the 23 km Dhekelia-Aridhipou-LIA road was delayed and has yet
to be completed, although the Dhekelia - Aridhipou section is open to traffic. The delay has been mainly
due to a long-running land acquisition dispute affecting the design of the Aridhipou junction which has
yet to be finalized: in view of the probable high cost of this junction the Bank advised the Government
to undertake a special feasibility study before proceeding with the works. This road, a major project
component, was eventually constructed as far as Aridhipou with Government funding due to a
disagreement with the Bank over procurement procedures. Loan funds released as a result of the GOC
undertaking the finance were reallocated to other uses including the support of works at the Kato Paphos
archaeological site. If the LIA improvement proceeds, it is essential that this road is completed. Since
the loan closed Government is now going ahead with the airport expansion and the Aridipou-LIA section
will be built shortly. The land dispute was settled by negotiation. However, the Dhekelia -Aridhipou
section can stand in its own right, whether the airport link were built or not and its re-estimated ERR is
about 41 %. The remaining 31.8 km of the road contruction and improvement program were completed
satisfactorily.


﻿4
(b)    Road pavement strengthening was carried out on 64.5 km including the Nicosia-
Limassol motorway. The three sections on the Nicosia - Limassol motorway with work completed in
1993 and 1994 indicate annual traffic growth rates of 8.1%, 7.33% and 10.2% compared with an
estimated 8% at the time of appraisal and ERR of 27%. This indicates that the ERR of the programme
as a whole will be well above the 12% criterion set at appraisal.
(c)    Constructing and equipping the new MCW Materials Laboratory and the bituminous
materials training laboratory at the Nicosia Higher Technical Institute (NHTI) was carried out successfully
and the facilities are of a very high standard. Approximately 20 students graduate each year from the
NHTI with training in bituminous materials and this should contribute significantly to the quality of road
works in Cyprus. The same could be said of the PWD Materials Laboratory but, currently, ironically
it is hampered by lack of staff due to a lack of budget to hire the trainees the NHTI programme is
training. To make full use of the facilities, the Bank has recommended that a market survey be carried
out to assess the opportunities for materials testing and, based on this, an appropriate staffing schedule
should be introduced. There is no reason why efforts should not be made to make the Laboratory self
supporting through undertaking commercial work.
(d)  The maintenance of the road system continues to be planned and monitored according
to the RMMS. Most roads, including minor, are maintained to an adequate level and provided with
strengthening where necessary. This is reflected in the Road Maintenance budget as shown in the
following figures:
Road Maintenance Expenditure
(fCyprus millions)
1988      1989       1990      19911      19921    19931      1994-1     1995    996
2.21      2.13       2.88      3.79       4.35     4.49       4.65     5.44     6.89
There has been substantial growth in the maintenance budget since 1990, above the rate estimated at
appraisal. Weigh-in-motion scales have been installed in two locations on the motorway which is
facilitating axle load control, but results to date cover too short a period to assess their effectiveness. As
part of the Government's Operational Plan, the efficacy of 24 hour use of this equipment should be
examined. Vehicles are being weighed, but there is a reluctance to prosecute over-loaded vehicles.
Road Transport
(a) The program to rationalize and improve the rural bus services has been successful. Technical
assistance to the companies was completed in 1992 and now the Department of Transport is conducting
the program in cooperation with local bus companies. There are 11 regional bus companies covering
about 37% of the rural bus fleet. The program is currently being revised to establish new incentives,
including compensation for the operation of non-profitable routes that are provided for social reasons,
provided management and operation complies with certain efficiency criteria. At appraisal it was
proposed to finance new buses under the project but, in the event, the government arranged to provide
low interest loans to owners instead.
(b) Satisfactory progress has been made with the computerization of the vehicle licensing and
information system. The loan financed feasibility studies and an outline of a possible system and the
Government has financed detailed design and equipment procurement: the system is being installed at the
present time in Nicosia and data entry will take place in the next few months.


﻿5
(c) The project also proposed to finance the study of Road User charges but due to procurement
delays this was not possible. However, the authorities are proceeding with this study using TORs that
were reviewed by the Bank. The cost of the study will be about $120,000.
Civil Aviation
2.03   The project as originally conceived, included the study of the feasibility of improving LIA,
preparation of the design and financing of the first phase of construction. However, due to the growth
of traffic the project was extended to cover Paphos airport which had very limited facilities. Traffic at
LIA rose from 1.97 million passengers in 1986 to 3.78 million in 1995: at Paphos traffic increased from
156,000 to 1.11 million in the same period. Following completion of the feasibility studies, undertaken
by consultants, the Government wished to review and possibly amend the results before going to design,
and also required special procedures for the submission of proposals for final design. The Bank found
this procedure unacceptable, and the provision of about US$300,000 for final design was reallocated.
The Government is proceeding with the design using its own resources and is actively seeking finance
for construction. Contracts for design of Larnaca and Paphos airports were signed in late 1995. A
project management team has been set up to manage the works, which are expected to be complete in
Paphos by the year 2000 and in Larnaca by 2002. In parallel with this work the question of financial
restructuring of the Civil Aviation Department and airport management, including the treatment of
concessions, is being examined. No progress has been made regarding possible privatization or increasing
airport management autonomy. The airports are financially viable as is shown by the following figures:

Ports
(a)    Although some improvements have been made in the organization of port operation, it
is still hindered by the traditional structure and attitudes that lead to increased costs and limitation of port
management autonomy. Consequently, there is always a danger that the ports' competitive position in
the east Mediterranean transit trade which is currently very strong, will be eroded by nearby ports willing
to face up to the unions and keep costs down. The infrastructure and equipment of the ports, especially
Limassol, is of a high standard. A major extension has been made to Limassol port's wharf capacity,
and, under the project (largely through suppliers' credits) post panamax gantry cranes and tugboats have
been procured. Port management is now trying to take the opportunity provided by the opening of a
significant increase in berths to introduce more modem working practices in the area, drawing a clear
line between the new area and the area where traditional practices are entrenched. The study on the


﻿6
future role of CPA and strategy to be followed for port operations, undertaken by CPA, under the
guidance of the Cyprus Development Bank, has been completed. The following studies are being carried
out:
(i)   the future role of Larnaca Port, by the Cyprus Development Bank; and
(ii)   pricing structure and strategy to better reflect modem technologies and needs for
flexibility. Tariffs were increased approximately by 30% in 1992 and a 15% increase
is under consideration, recommended by CPA.
(b)    The CPA has an ongoing training program financed from its own resources.
Kato Paphos Archaeological Project
2.04   After appraisal and in association with proposed road works in Paphos, the Bank agreed to
finance a new component to preserve and develop an important archaeological site adjoining a project
road on a coastal peninsular. This was made possible by funds reallocated from the Dekhelia-Andipou
road. The Kato-Paphos peninsular has been occupied for centuries but in the last two hundred years had
become farming land. Recent ploughing had brought up mosiac fragments which on investigation proved
to be from the floors of houses of the Greek administrators of the area in the period 0-200 AD. The
mosaics proved to be of such value that UNESCO declared the peninsula a World Heritage site, but lack
of funds has left much of it unexcavated, and what has been excavated, poorly presented. The Bank
decided this project would make an ideal vehicle to demonstrate its sensitivity to cultural heritage and
recruited internationally known archaeologists and landscape architects. Their work and recommendations
for the development of the site are described in a Bank publication "Of Mosques and Mosaics".
Consequently, US$3.5 million were reallocated (from the Dhekelia-Aridhipou-LIA road) to carry out this
work. Unfortunately, although work has been carried out, progress has been slow owing to the complex
administrative structure, the proliferation of agencies involved and the difficulty of working in such a rich
archaeological site.
3.     Implementation Record
3.01   The loan closing date was scheduled for December 31st, 1994 but this was postponed until 31st
December 1995. The original cost (including the Dhekelia - Aridhipou road costing US$18.1 million
which was eventually entirely financed by the Government) was estimated at US$121 million and the final
cost estimate is approximately US$140.0 million. However, it must be pointed out that total project cost
estimates are not precise in those components where the Bank's financial participation was very limited
or absent (primarily ports and civil aviation - see Table 8A) and this is a failure of the information
arrangements the design of which should have been addressed more directly during supervision. As of
now it is not practical to try to resolve it. The cost overrun has been met by the Government. At the
request of the Government, due to macro-economic considerations and project delays, US$5 million of
the loan was cancelled with effect from November 1994 and, at loan closing, US$953,779 remained
undisbursed and was cancelled.
3.02   The delay in project completion was, in common with earlier Bank financed projects, partly the
result of procurement delays, differences over procurement with the Bank and problems in obtaining
agreement over land acquisition. Greater public participation in these sorts of planning decisions would
be needed to provide input into future project planning and scheduling. However, in addition to this it


﻿7
took nearly a year from Board approval on February 9th, 1988 to effectiveness on January 5th, 1989.
Delay in effectiveness cannot be attributed to any one reason: in common with other projects in Cyprus
decision taking is simply slow and this, together with problems in establishing the Transport Sector
Project Planning and Monitoring Unit and differences regarding procurement procedures for the Dhekelia
- Aridhipou - LIA road, caused the delay. The delay on this last account could have been avoided had
the matter been settled during the appraisal and negotiations of the project.
3.03   Cost overruns were partly a function of delays in procurement but also due to some changes in
project design. The Bank, during the last 25 years of participation in the sector, has been able to make
some improvements in procurement in Cyprus but the basic law and procedures, which involve many
people and agencies, have not changed and it is unlikely that they will. Nonetheless, with the exception
of the Government adopting non-Bank procedures for the award of the Dhekelia - Aridhipou road and
the change in procedure regarding the airport design, there were no serious problems, only delays.
4.     Project Sustainability
4.01   The project executing agencies have shown a commitment to the project objectives. This has been
demonstrated by the willingness to continue to address transport sector issues even in the absence of Bank
financing and professional support. The road maintenance budget is more than keeping pace with traffic
needs and, together with road strengthening and improvement, is subjected to rigorous economic and
technical evaluation. Environmental issues are now being treated very seriously. Although institutional
progress in the ports and civil aviation sectors has been less than satisfactory, the relevant authorities are
still pursuing objectives leading to greater efficiency and financial viability. Other objectives such as
reform of road user charges, continued development of the rural bus industry and control of vehicle axle
loads are also receiving strong support. Government has continued to state that they would wish contact
with the Bank to continue on an informal basis, even though loan financing has come to an end.
4.02   The Government's commitment to continuing development of a strong and competitive transport
sector and industry is clearly reflected in their Operational Plan (see Appendix A).
5.     Bank Performance
5.01   The Bank's performance vis-a-vis this project should be seen as a culmination of a long period
of participation in the transport sector spanning twenty-five years. During this time the Bank provided
significant financial support, but perhaps the most important contribution has been a considerable element
of technical assistance which reflected a strong commitment to the client and to the Bank's development
agenda. This has not only led to improvements in technical and economic matters but has instilled a
strong sense of discipline into the improvement and operation of the system.
5.02   The Bank was flexible in accepting economically and environmentally justified revisions to the
project, in particular the reallocation of loan proceeds to provide assistance to the archaeological site at
Kato Paphos which, without Bank support and enthusiasm, might well have deteriorated.
5.03   The Bank's follow-up of policy commitments during project supervision was weak. On the other
hand, the Bank insisted on the application of appropriate procurement procedures, as provided in the loan
documents. On balance, its performance should be regarded as satisfactory.


﻿8
6.     Borrower Performance
6.01   The Borrower's performance involves three aspects:
(a)    Under the aegis of the MCW the executing agencies (Public Works Department, Roads
Branch, Departments of Civil Aviation and Transport and the Cyprus Ports Authority)
performed well showing commendable enthusiasm and dedication to the achievement of
project objectives, despite occasional difficulties with other Government agencies.
However, the planning authorities could have done better towards achieving the timely
resolution of land acquisition problems as, for example with the Dhekelia - Aridhipou -
LIA road, which lead to major delays and possibly higher costs.
(b)    The Cyprus procurement process is still exceedingly slow - typically a year to award
quite small civil works or study contracts. No action was taken on a study of how to
speed up the process, financed by the loan. It seems unlikely that the system, which is
quite transparent, will change but it would be useful if the Government could raise the
financial thresholds for in-house procurement by individual ministries and agencies which
do not have to go through the Tender Board.
(c)    Project execution and planning is sometimes negatively influenced by other government
agencies: prominent in this is the Planning Bureau. While it is appropriate for the
Planning Bureau to be concerned with macro-economic targets, it is inefficient for it to
attempt to influence properly prepared and analyzed technical matters on a day to day
basis. Ideally, once an annual program and budget have been agreed its implementation
should be strictly the province of the executing agency and ministry. In this context it
is strongly to be recommended that the Transport Sector Planning and Monitoring Unit
is reinstated in the MCW. Government has now agreed to the outposting of Planning
Bureau staff to the executing agencies.
6.02   Despite these considerations, borrower performance should be considered satisfactory, given the
achievement of project objectives, the satisfactory rate of return of key physical components and the
demonstrated ability to conduct its business without further need for Bank assistance.
7.     Assessment of Outcome
7.01   Although the project was delayed by one year and some changes were made to project
components, the project was satisfactory:
(a)    most highway improvement objectives were achieved, including institutional targets;
(b)    the ground-work was prepared for development of Larnaca and Paphos airports;
(c)    the rural bus services have improved and vehicle registration has been modernized and
made more efficient as a revenue gathering and traffic monitoring tool; and
(d)    Cyprus Ports Authority has upgraded Limassol port and is continuing to push for
rationalization of port structure and tariffs.


﻿9
Furthermore, achievements in earlier projects, such as the use of economic analysis of investment
proposals, improvement of road maintenance management, environmental awareness and axle load control
are being continued and strengthened.
7.02   Less successful were the attempts to streamline procurement procedures, provide the revenue
earning entities, greater autonomy in management decisions and preparation of a new road user charges
scheme. However, the latter is now under way with finance from the Government.
7.03   Table 9 summarizes the economic re-evaluation of the project. Due to changes in project
components, especially the exclusion of the Dhekelia - Aridhipou road from the loan and failure to
complete the associated Aridhipou - LIA link, and the re-allocation of some of the loan proceeds and local
finance to the Kato Paphos site protection, an exact comparison with the appraisal rates of return cannot
be made. Also, several of the components have only recently been completed so that clear trends in
benefit streams cannot be identified. Consequently the re-evaluation is limited to (i) the road construction
and improvement component which, including the Dhekelia road, amounted to about 50% of the total
project cost; on the basis of available data, this component shows a re-estimated ERR of the order of
42%, assuming eventual completion of the Aridhipou - LIA link, compared with the appraisal estimate
of 40%; and (ii) re-evaluation of the road strengthening program comprising about 8% of total project
cost, which at appraisal had to meet a minimum 12% ERR criterion, has shown re-evaluated ERRs in
excess of 20%. The overall ERR of the roads component has been re-evaluated at about 41 %. The post
panamax port gantry cranes have been recently installed and their performance is satisfactory. No rates
of return have been calculated for technical assistance and studies, construction and equipping the
materials laboratory, rural bus reorganization or the Kato Paphos protection works.
7.04   MCW has prepared an operational plan, attached as Appendix A, which lists the most important
issues to focus upon. As there are to be no further lending operations this plan does not include
monitoring and reporting details.
8.     Key Lessons Learned
8.01   This was the seventh and final transport project of the Bank's twenty-five year involvement in
Cyprus. Whilst all objectives have not been achieved, the advances in planning and managing the
transport sector have been significant and, from this point of view, graduation has come at the right time.
However, there are still lessons to be learned and issues to be addressed.
For the Government:
(a)    Procurement procedures are slow and costly and should be improved. Whilst it is
unlikely that procurement procedures will be significantly amended, and they have the
merit of transparency, there should be scope to update financial thresholds at which
certain actions have to be taken Also, the influence on implementation of existing
procurement procedures should have been built into project scheduling.
(b)    Greater autonomy should be given by supervising ministries to the executing and revenue
earning entities. In particular (and as was identified in the ICR on the Fourth Highway
Project), non-technical agencies should not be allowed to influence day to day
management of technical matters. Currently this is a source of considerable delays and
increased costs.


﻿10
(c)    There should be greater public participation at an earlier stage in the planning process,
especially where land acquisition is involved.
For the Bank:
a)     The Bank can make an effective contribution to institutional reform only through a series
of projects and with a willing partner. However as a country approaches graduation, the
Bank's leverage declines. For this reason, initiatives which were embraced by the
Borrower at appraisal in 1987, such as procurement reform, were not carried through.
b)     project supervision should pay greater attention to the policy components which are
important even though the amount of funding allocated is low.
c)     By showing flexibility the Bank was able to help the Borrower reallocate funds from a
component unlikely to make progress to a new component of international importance
(Paphos Mosaics).

MINISTRYOF COMMUNICATIONS AND WORKS
TRANSPORT SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
OPERATIONAL PLAN
1.    The Transport Sector Development Project (TSDP) represented a wide ranging
effort to address issues throughout the transport sector and to establish a policy for
the future. This policy's primary objectives were to:
a) provide an efficient transport infrastructure to support and promote
economic and social development, and specific opportunities for foreign exchange
earning, in a cost effective way;
b) improve the management and planning of transport sector activities through
institutional reforms and training;
c) encourage. where appropriate, a policy of cost recovery and operation on
a commercial basis; and,
d) ensure a full and sustainable commitment to environmental protection.
2.    Although important progress was made in these areas there were cases where
objectives were not fully reached: this was particularly the case regarding institutional
and policy reforms. The Government, through the Ministry of Communications and
Works, proposes to continue its efforts to maintain the achievements of the TDSP and
to pursue the attainment of the above objectives on a long-term basis.
3.    The Operational Plan will take the following actions to address the various
issues.
Highways Sector:
a) Continue to maintain the highway system according to the Road
Maintenance Management System and to ensure the adequacy of funds.
b) Only undertake those investment and improvement projects which are
shown to be economically and socially justifiable. In this context the Roads Sector
will continue to use and develop its "in house" planning and monitoring capability.
c) Examine ways in which road users may contribute more equitably to the
finance of road maintenance and investment. including implementing the
recmmendations of the ongoing Road User Charges study, and undertake a study to
assess the value and possibility of introducing road toll systems.
d) Develop the operations of the materials laboratory with the eventual
target of making it a useful regional revenue earning entity.
Transport Department:
a) Proceed with the rationalisation of the passenger transport industry,
especially rural buses. in order to provide services in keeping with changing economic
and social conditions. This approach may be extended to reforms in other areas of the


﻿APPENDIX A
Page 2 of Z
road transport industry.
b) Complete the computerisation of the road transport licensing system and to
extend this. where appropriate, to interface with road traffic regulation and road
safety.
Ports Sector:
a) Complete the studies being undertaken by the Cyprus Development Bank
on Tariff and Port Operations restructuring and apply the results as appropriate.
b) Study the rationalisation of ports operations, especially the respective
functions of Limassol and-Larnaca ports.
c) Improve the ports' internal movements, especially with a view to
improving the standards of safety.
d) Pay increased attention to environmental protection as regards both
pollution and building developments.
Civil Aviation Sector:
a) Proceed with completion of design. tendering and project management
procedures and financing for the first phases of improvement of Larnaca and Paphos
airports.
b) Undertake improvement of Larnaca and Paphos airports ensuring
environmental protection during the process.
c) Review the management and financial structure of airport operation with a
view to making this more demand responsive and commercially based and with less
central control.
Kato Paphos Archaeological Site:
a) Continue to implement the programme of protection and development
agreed with the World Bank and assure funds for this purpose.
b) Identify other sites where such work may be required and develop plans
accordingly. In association with this, consideration should be given to creating a
special and permanent PWD archaeological unit.
c) Preserve traditional skills which have been used in these works so that they
may be available to use elsewhere.
4.    The Ministry of Communications and Works will also:
a) Investigate the possibility of reinstating the multi-mode planning and project
monitoring unit set up under the project but subsequently disbanded.
b) Discuss and agree with the relevant authorities greater day-to-day operating
freedom of the executing agencies within agreed annual or multi-annual programmes
of work.

PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENT
World Bank Project Completion Mission by Jeremy Lane, Highway
Engineer and Robert Bonney (Consultant) April, 1996
Transport Sector Development Project (TSDP)
AIDE MEMOIRE
1.    This Aide Memoire summarises the findings of a World Bank (WB) mission
consisting of Messrs. Jeremy Lane and Robert Bonney (Consultant Transport
Economist) which visited the Republic of Cyprus from April 14th to 24th, 1996. The
primary purpose of the mission was to (i) update the progess of the TSDP (Loan
2906-CY) which was closed on the 31st December. 1995; (ii) discuss the Cyprus
Government's proposals for future project operation; and (iii) collect information for
the preparation of the project Implementation Completion Report (ICR) due by June
30th, 1996. This Aide Memoire will be confirmed from Washington. The mission
would like to thank the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Communications and
works (MCW) Dr. Vassos Pyrgos and his colleagues in the Public Works
Department, Civil Aviation Department, Department of Road Transport and Cyprus
Ports Authority, and Mr. Frixos Sorokos. Ministry of Finance for their assistance and
welcome during the mission's stay in Cyprus. And, furthermore, to express, on
behalf of all earlier Bank transport personnel, their thanks for valuable help during
25 years of cooperation.
General
2     The TSDP (Loan 2906-CY in the sum of US$35 million), which became
effective in May, 1989, addressed physical and institutional needs across the entire
spectrum of transport activity in Cyprus including highways, public transport, ports
and civil aviation. In addition, in view of Cyprus' wealth of archaeological remains
and the potential impact of transport development on these, the project included
assistance to the protection and development, for educational and tourist purposes, of
the important archaeological site at Kato Paphos.
3.    Although US$ 5 million of the loan was cancelled at the request of the
Borrower due to macro-economic considerations and US$965,235 remained unspent
at the closing date, and will be cancelled, the project was largely successful in
achieving its physical objectives. On the institutional side progress was not as good,
due primarily to factors over which the executing agencies had little control and to
continuing slow official procurement procedures. However, some progress was made
and the Government is ccontinuing to address some important issues, and this is
reflected in the Project Operating Plan which is annexed to this Aide Memoire.
4.    At the time of appraisal and negotiations the need was identified to establish
a multi-mode transport planning and coordinating unit in order to facilitate a balanced
approach to the whole sector. Consequently. the Transport Sector Planning and


﻿APPENDIX C
Page 2 of 6
Project Monitoring Unit (TSPPM) was set up as required by the Loan Agreement.
However, it was eventually largely disbanded as part of central planning authorities'
restructuring. The mission believes that such a unit, located in the MCW, will be
of considerable value in optimising the resource planning of the sector.
Consequently, the mission strongly recommends that the TSPPM is reformed and
reinstated as soon as possible.
Highway Sector
5.    Although the TSPPM was disbanded, the Public Works Department (PWD)
continued with its own Project Monitoring and Planning Unit and this has proved very
effective in supervising the implementation of Highway Sector objectives, and it is
the PWD intention to continue with this Unit. However, the mission was concerned
that financial and planning agencies, whilst justifiably concerned over the allocation
of financial resources and macro-economic policy, still influence day-to-day decisions
which are often of a technical nature. This has led to project delays which, almost
certainly, have cost Cyprus considerable sums of money in higher prices and lost
benefits. The Government should address this issue and strive to adopt a policy
where, once an annual programme has been agreed. the executing agencies, such as
PWD, are permitted to adopt the most cost/effective implementation.
6.    Certain changes took place to the originally envisaged highway sector
programme and this was one of the main reasons for the cancellation of US$5 million
at the request of the Government. In particular. only part of the Aridhipou -
Lanarca International Airport (LIA) was built under the Loan due to differences with
the WB over procurement (eventually the Dhekelia - Aridhipou section was entirely
financed by the Government) and difficulties in obtaining agreement with the local
population on alignment issues. However, other economically justified sections of
road were substituted. The loan as negotiated envisaged approximately US$19.5
million being spent on road construction and improvement and the final loan amount
disbursed against this category amounted to about US$18.4 million.The pavement
strengthening programme was appraised at USS5 million and the eventual expenditure
from the loan was about US$5.7 million. The works have been executed to a good
standard and, with the Maintenance Management System and vehicle axle control
being rigorously applied, should lead to a sustainable improvement to the road
system.
7.    The other appraised components consisted of:
(i) A new materials laboratory and equipment. and equipment for the Higher
Technical Institute: the Loan Agreement foresaw USS1.5 million being spent on this
and, in the event, disbursements amounted to about US$2.3 million. The works and
procurement of equipment were completed satisfactorily and to a high standard.
However, the potential of a first class materials laboratory. which could be a
significant revenue earner, is being constrained due to insufficient skilled personnel
and this issue should be addressed with urgency.
(ii) Technical assistance, primarily studies including those in civil aviation and
road transport, was estimated at US$3 million. In the event only about half this
amount has been disbursed. This shortfall has been due. primarily to procurement
delays and the WB not agreeing to the finance of Phase 2 (design) of the Larnaca

International Airport (LIA) study. However, the Cyprus authorities have or will
finance the outstanding work from their own resources. In this context the mission
was pleased to learn that the Road User Charges Study contract was signed during the
mission. The mission, however, proposed that a separate study, should address the
question of introducing a system of toll charges.
Road Transport Sector
8.    The project contained two components in the road transport sector which are
the responsibility of the Department of Road Transport.
Rural Bus Services: It was decided in the 1970s that the traditional village bus
service was becoming unsuitable for the changing economic and social environment
and a more efficient and cost effective service could be provided by grouping
individual village buses in regional companies. This policy would be supported by
financial and technical assistance. Currently there are 11 regional bus companies
representing about 40% of the total village bus fleet and the new system appears to
be working well. However, there has been a hiatus in this programme because
modifications are being made to the scheme. These include Government support for
routes operated for social reasons, provided all actions are taken to improve the
efficiency of operations. The loan financed technical assistance to support this and
the technical assistance programme was completed in 1992.
Computerisation of Road Transport Department: The design of this system
was financed under the TSDP and this was completed satisfactorily in 1992. The
design has now been translated into the procurement of soft-ware and hard-ware and
installation is now in progress and trained staff have been recruited. There is a link
with the police system which will assist in transport regulations enforcement and road
safety programmes. As regards road safety, although this was not a component of the
project, the mission was disturbed by the apparent serious worsening of the road
accident (especially fatalities) position.
Civil Aviation
9.    Following the events of 1974, Nicosia airport became unavailable and civil
aviation activities were transferred to Larnaca. The facilities of Larnaca were
essentially temporary and, as traffic grew, became less and less satisfactory. It was
decided by the Government that new facilities at LIA were needed and that a study
should be undertaken to define a development policy through the production of a
Master Plan to be followed by design and eventually construction. The WB agreed
to finance the preparation of the Master Plan and design under the project. Phase I,
the Master Plan, was completed in 1992 and. as part of the same contract, a Master
Plan for Paphos airport was also completed. Between the start of the project in 1989
and the end of 1995, passenger traffic at LIA has risen from just over 2 million to
nearly 3.8 million, and at Paphos passenger traffic has risen from about 480,000 in
1989 to 1.1 million in 1995. To cope with these increases whilst plans were being
prepared and construction took place, it has been necessary to make improvements
to existing facilities and this has been financed by the Government. Due to the
Government wishing to undertake a review and possible modification of the Master
Plan before proceeding to design the WB felt unable to finance the design phase from
the Loan and the proceeds were reallocated. The Government is proceeding with the

design and arrangements are being made for project management, tendering and
financing. The airports are, as a whole. financially viable, but arrangements are
being made for restructuring operation and finances. The mission recommended that
this restructuring should give consideration to greater autonomy to the airports
administration which, currently, is subject to considerable official control, even on
relatively minor day-to-day matters. and this can only lead to a loss of efficiency.
Cyprus Ports Authority
10.   The primary ports in Cyprus are at Larnaca and Limassol: in addition there
are separate oil discharging facilities at the Larnaca refinery and the Moni power
station. The two ports provide general and bulk cargo, container and passenger
facilities, although Limassol is the far larger operation. The future of Lamaca port
is, at present, under consideration. Limassol has recently expanded its capability,
especially for containers where it competes with other ports in the region for transit
traffic. There is no doubt that Limassol is a well run and competitive port but it has
been bedevilled with operational problems resulting from the complex and often
conflicting responsibilities for different operations. The WB has. through two ports
projects, tried to address these issues but with little success. The TSDP continued
these efforts although no finance was provided under the Loan. Similarly to other
sectors, although physical investment targets (amounting to about USS130 million
equivalent) were met (financed by the Government, EC and Banks), the institutional
achievements have been less than desired. Although tariffs were raised in 1993 by
32% and a further 30% increase is under discussion. the fragmented character of
operational responsibility in the ports is still a major problem.
11.   Terms of Reference for a complete reform of tariff procedures have been
prepared for CPA board submission and these will look into the possibility of more
flexible tariff arrangements and enabling tariffs to be modified to take into account
changes in technology. A further study is also under-way (Cyprus Development
Bank) to examine and recommend port restructuring to increase its autonomy and
freedom of action, although this is unlikely to lead to privatisation. The mission
wishes to emphasise most strongly the need to proceed with these studies and to
implement their results if the CPA is to maintain a competitive position. The mission
was also concerned over the movement of traffic in the port area of Limassol which
is dangerous and poorly controlled. Efforts should be made to address this including
segregation of traffic using physical barriers and white lines.
Kato Paphos Archaeological Protection
12.   The Bank's participation in the preparation and development of the Kato
Paphos site was an amendment to the appraised project and originated when road
improvement works in the area were being considered. This is one of the most
important sites in the eastern Mediterranean and desrves protection: it is also of
considerable tourist value and potential. Consequently, loan proceeds in the sum of
USS6 million were reallocated for protection and development purposes. Although
work has proceeded on this component . and is now gathering speed, it has been
subject to many delays and only USS937.000 had been disbursed by loan closing. The
primary reasons for delays were (i) the large number of departments and organisations


﻿APPENDIX C
Page 5 of 6
involved which slowed down decision taking: (ii) delay in appointing supervision
personnel; and (iii) the large quantity of archaeological remains which came to light
when engineering works were started and. hence. caused a stoppage of work whilst
investigations were carried out and protection works completed. It is a pity,
especially regarding the Bank's and MCW's pioneering efforts in this field, that the
project could not have made fuller use of the resources made a,ailable for this
component. However, the authorities concerned and the PWD personnel involved are
to be commended for their dedication and perseverance, and it is hoped that adequate
funds will be forthcoming from other sources. The mission also recommends that
efforts are made,
(i) to preserve many of the traditional skills that have been employed, through
training young people; there will be a need for these elsewhere; and
(ii) to examine the possibility of the PWD forming a special service or unit
to undertake this sort of work in the future.
Actions by the Government
13.   The mission has advised the Borrower on the needs of and procedures for the
ICR and these are clearly understood and a plan for future project operation has been
prepared and is attached to this Aide Memoire.
14.   The Roads Section of the PWD is reworking the economic evaluation of the
final road programme in the light of changes to the components and updated traffic
flows, construction/improvement costs and vehicle operating costs. Although these
results are not yet available, preliminary examinations indicate that the final estimate
of ERR (at loan closing date) will be satisfactory.
