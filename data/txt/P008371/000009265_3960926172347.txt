MEMORANDUM AID RECO,MMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS
FOR A TRANSPORT SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed loan to the Republic of Cyprus
for US$35 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed loan
would be repayable in 15 years including 3 years period of grace at the
standard variable interest rate and would assist in financing the 1988-91
Transport Development Program including technical assistance and training
in the transport sector and highway construction, rehabilitation and
maintenance.
2.       Background.  Since the First Port Project in 1969, Bank
involvement in the transport sector sDans a period of considerable change
in Cyprus' society and economy. The ^eorier.tation of the economy following
the events of 1974 required considextEble investment in the transport
infrastructure. At first these were emergency operations such as, with
Nicosia airport closed, the development of an international airport at
Larnaca as a temporary facility. Longer term investments followed these
emergency measures as the new orientation in the economy became
established. These included the improvement of existing port facilities,
construction of the new Nicosia-Limassol road and a rural road improvement
program. The transport sector as it stands today comprising roads, ports
and civil aviation, is well established and together with part of the
construction industry, contributes approximately 11% of the Gross Domestic
Product and employs an estimated llZ of the non-agricultural workforce.
While adopting a prudent fiscal strategy, the Government's transport sector
policy is to support the developmenL of productive activities, including
agriculture, light industry, port services and the important tourist
industry, all of which are largely privately operated. Nevertheless,
although the sector performs well, there are policy reforms which could
further improve efficiency. Port efficiency and revenue could be enhanced,
transport planning could be better integrated and improved, road
maintenance planning techniques need to be advanced, the airports should be
put on a sound financial footing, procurement procedures need to be speeded
up and transport training should be more systematic. Government has
recognized these issues and, supported by preparation of this project,
steps are underway for their resolution. Parts of the transport
infrastructure also require improvement. The Larnaca International Airport
(LIA) temporary terminal is extremely congested, as are roads through
Larnaca itself. These and some other parts of the infrastructure require
upgrading if bottlenecks are not to hamper the effective performance of the
economy and lead to damaging effects to the environment.



3.       Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank's previous involvement in
the transport sector has helped Cyprus to adjust to the post-1974 situation
through new investments in the infrastructure and, more recently, focussing
on maintenance and rehabilitation. To name but some aspects of policy
review and reform, the Bank has supported axle load legislation and
enforcement, the formation of the Cyprus Ports Authority, the commencement
of a road maintenance management system and of a study which will lead to a
Transport Sector Master Plan. Our involvement is still required to
continue this process of policy reform with resulting improvement in
efficiency particularly in the areas of transport planning, maintenance
planning and the financial performance of revenue earning entities,
Performance in implementing Bank-financed transport projects has been
reasonable. Continued Bank assistance in developing a self-sustaining
system of sector management and operation would be in keeping with Bank
policy and strategy, and would be of major benefit to Cyprus in meeting
transport demand and supporting economic growth.
4.       Project Objectives.  The principal objective of the project is to
support the Government in its resolution of the above issues, which in
aggregate will contribute significantly to improving transport efficiency.
T'he project wiLl also support improvement to those parts of the network
which are becoming congested, and further rehabilitation in line wiLh the
program proceeding under Highwavs IV. The program therefore has as its
principal objectives:
(a)    increasing efficiency in transport sector operating systems;
(b)    strengthening the financial basis of transport sector
operations;
(c)    improving the quality of transport planning and project
implementation; and
(d)    upgrading priority areas of the transport infrastructure and
industry.
5.       Project Description.  The proposed project which covers the
1988-91 Transport Investment Program (except for components already being
financed under the ongoing Third and Fourth Highway Projects) would
include: (i) construction of the 23 km Dhekelia-Aridhinpou-Larnaca
International Airport (LIA) road; (ii) other road improvement schemes to be
selected from the 1988-1991 investment program; (iii) pavement
strengthening; (iv) improvements to the passenger and freight handling
facilities at LIA; (v) improving cargo handling facilities, especially for
containers, at Limassol port; (vi) equioping and setting up new regional
b_s companies; (vii) technical assistance to undertake feasibility studies,
special studies and support in project supervision; (viii) a training
program for the Roads Branch of the Public Works Department,



Ministry of Communi-ations and Works (MCW) and the Civil Aviation
Department, MCW, including buildings and equipment, training specialists
and overseas fellowships; and (ix) construction and equipment for a new
central materials laboratory and equipment for highway management. The
t3tal cost of the four-year program (less those items already being
financed under the Third and Fourth Highway Projects) is estimated at
US$121.0 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$69.0
million. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are given in Schedule
A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Cyprus are
given in Schedules C and D respectively. A map is also attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report No.6955-CY dated January 6, 1988 is being
distributed separately.
6.       Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, the Government agreed to
(inter alia) (i) the improvement and coordination if transport planning
through the appropriate staffing, methooology and operation of a Transport
Sector Planning and Monitoring Unit within Lne MCW; (ii) an annual review
by the Bank of the Government's proposed Transport Sector Development and
Recurrent Budget; and (iii) a detailed Action Plan covering: (a) the
working schedule of an inter-Ministerial Committee on Procurement to
improve and speed up cumbersome procurement procedures; (b) the formation
of a private sector container handling company; (c) a review anc
restructuring of tariffs in line with ship and cargo trends; (d)
introducing commercial financial practice into the operation of civil
aviation ground facilities; and (e) a Lraining program for transport,
highways and civil aviation staff.
7.       Benefits.  Economic benefits under the proposed project are
expected from: (i) savings in vehicle operating costs and road accident
reduction following road improvements; (ii) greater efficiency in the
operation of ports and, in particular, improved international
competitiveness in the lucrative transit traffic i:. containers; (iii)
improved operations and development of a regional hub at Larnaca
International Airport; (iv) increased efficiency in rural bus transport;
and (v) improved productivity among transport sector personnel. The
economic rate of return is estimated at more than 302.
8.       Risks.  The proposed project is not subject to any unusual risks.
The two areas where problems may arise are: (i) the institutional reform of
container handling at Limassol port where, due to the issues involving
private and public sector interests, delays may still occur; however,
agreement in principle on a port operating company has already been reached
and a December 31, 1988 target date is believed to be realistic for the
company to be operational; and (ii) due to the complex procedures,

procurement can be slow. Government is aware of this problem which will be
addressed under the proposed project.
9.       Recomnendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive directors approve the proposed loan.
