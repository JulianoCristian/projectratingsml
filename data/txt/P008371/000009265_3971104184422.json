Cyprus' Transport\n            Sector Development Project. Its primary objectives were: (a)\n            increasing the efficiency of the transport sector operating\n            system; (b) improving cost recovery in revenue earning\n            transport sector operations and in the highway system; (c)\n            enhancing the quality of transport planning and project\n            implementation, including attention being paid to\n            environmental issues; (d) upgrading priority areas of the\n            transport infrastructure to support economic growth and\n            social change in a cost effective way; and (e) increasing\n            the extent and quality of training provided for personnel in\n            the roads, road transport and civil aviation sub-sectors.\n            The project was well designed in relation to the stage of\n            development of the transport sector in Cyprus, was\n            successfully implemented, achieved the high ERR expected at\n            appraisal and, given the Government's continued\n            commitment, is likely to be sustainable. There are still\n            lessons to be learned and issues to be addressed. For the\n            Government: (a) Procurement procedures are slow and costly\n            and should be improved. (b) Greater autonomy should be given\n            by supervising ministries to the executing and revenue\n            earning entities. (c) There should be greater public\n            participation at an earlier stage in the planning process,\n            especially where land acquisition is involved. For the Bank:\n            a) The Bank can make an effective contribution to\n            institutional reform only through a series of projects and\n            with a willing partner. However as a country approaches\n            graduation, the Bank's leverage declines.  b) Project\n            supervision should pay greater attention to the policy\n            components which are important even though the amount of\n            funding allocated is low. c) By showing flexibility the Bank\n            was able to help the Borrower reallocate funds from a\n            component unlikely to make progress to a new component of\n            international importance."}, "docdt": "1997-06-16T15:06:05Z"}
