   type in Sri Lanka, is aimed at supporting both the food and\n            tree crop sub-sectors. It is designed to support on-going\n            priority Government agricultural rehabilitation and\n            development programs through the provision of imported\n            capital equipment and technical assistance. Support provided\n            would increase agricultural production in the short-term and\n            would lay the foundation for longer-term, more comprehensive\n            development. IDA funds would provide finance for the c.i.f.\n            costs of imported farm tractors, machinery, equipment and\n            transport vehicles (US$18.0 million), and spare parts for\n            farm tractors, earth moving equipment and the coconut\n            processing industry (US$6.5 million). Technical assistance\n            would be provided for pre-investment studies and for\n            improvements in machinery repair facilities (US$0.5 million)."}, "docdt": "1975-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
