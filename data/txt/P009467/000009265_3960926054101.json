The area\n            development and basic shelter component includes area\n            development for urban plots and building material loans for\n            basic shelter in a pilot project in Chittagong. The third\n            component supports institutional development through\n            technical assistance for establishing project implementation\n            units. It further provides for studies of traffic\n            management, area wide drainage in Chittagong, manpower\n            development and organizational and managerial reforms in\n            local government."}, "docdt": "1988-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
