Following\n            a review of the legal, and administrative arrangements, it\n            assesses the analysis of alternatives for the installation\n            of transmission lines (TL), and for substations location, to\n            minimize environmental, and resettlement impacts. Taking\n            into account the Environmental Law, the project design\n            avoids dense forest areas, and preferably selects forest\n            areas of low economic, and ecological value, for both\n            temporary access roads, and installation of TLs. Surveys\n            revealed there are no cultural, or archaeological sites\n            along the project area; however, if local sites are\n            discovered, authorities from the Electricity of Vietnam\n            (EVN) shall notify local authorities. Nonetheless, during\n            construction, environmental concerns feature vegetation\n            clearance, soil erosion due to excavations for temporary\n            access road construction, and due to equipment/material\n            transportation. Measures to mitigate adverse impacts include\n            the installation of retaining fences to prevent slope\n            erosion, followed by vegetation, and tree planting to avoid\n            soil erosion. In such cases where slopes, or swamps cannot\n            be avoided for the installation of poles, pole-footings will\n            be redesigned to suit ground conditions. Hunting, and lumber\n            activities will be strictly forbidden, in compliance with\n            the Forestry Control Branch regulations. Local health\n            facilities will be available at construction camps to ensure\n            medical, and hygienic measures, particularly in the\n            prevention of endemic, and waterborne diseases.\n            Electromagnetic fields at the edge of the right of way, will\n            be kept below 5 KV/m, in accordance with international standards."}, "docdt": "2005-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
