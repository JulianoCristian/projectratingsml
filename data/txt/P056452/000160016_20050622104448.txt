4.4. SCREENING FOR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
4.1. CLASSIFICATION OF IMPACTS
The Environmental Impact Assessment focuses on the major environmental issues of
the Project's Most Favoured Alternative. The potential impacts of the Project's pre-
construction, construction, and operation phases were assessed as being in one of five
|              categories:
i. NO IMPACT. The potential impact of the Project activity is assessed as NO
IMPACT if the project activity is physically removed in space or time from the
environmental cormponenc.
I                ii. MAJOR IMPACT. An impact is said to be MAJOR if the project activity has
potential to affect an environmental component. Major impacts could be "Major
|                   Negative" or "Major Positive." The following criteria were used to determine
whether a given impact is MAJOR:
a) Spatial scale of the impact (site, local, regional, or national/ international);
b) Time horizon of the impact (slhort, medium, or long term);
c) Magnitude of the change in the environmental component brought about by
the Project activities (small, moderate, large);
d) Importance to local human populations;
|                       e) Compliance with national, provincial, or district environmental protection
laws, standards, and fegulations
|                       f) Compliance with Vietnam's international commitments. These includc the
Convention  oni Wctl nncIs of Ilitcrnntionl.1 Jrmportanec ospcei ,lly Li L
Waterfowl Habitat (RAMSAR), the Convention Concerning the Protection
*                         of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage (World Heritage Convention),
and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild
|                         Fauna and Flora (CITES); and
g) Compliance with World Bank guidelines, policies, and regulations.
iii. MINOR IMPACT. If an impact occurs but does not meet the criteria for a Major
Impact it is assigned the category MINOR. Minor impacts could be "Minor
negative" or "Minor Positive."
I              MITIGABLE IMPACT. The potential impact of a project activity on an environmeantal
component is said to be MITIGABLE if there is potential for a major negative impact and
the proposed mitigation measure will prevent the impact or reduce the impact to
acceptable levels.

|              4.2. IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF THE PROJECT
The Project wil play an important role in the electrification program and in
implementation of the policy of poverty alleviation of 16 communes within 4 Project's
provinces. It will also promote the policy of industrialization and modernization of the
Government of Vietnam as well as create a great opportunity for overall socio-economic
development of the poor area.
W;hen the distributtion lines are constructed, there is a trend of local people to move
to live near the lines. The local people committee will have a proper planning accordingly
to support the development of the areas. These planning are included: road, residential
area, industrial development and farming etc. The communes/districts or provinces will
move towvard its planning.
These positive socio-economic values of the project are great. Refer to the Projcct
Document for more details.
Beside thie significant beneficial impacts, the project may cause different adverse
impacts on the environment and local socio-economy. By using Environmental Screening
I              Data Checklist and Environmental baseline Checklist as guided in Framework for
Applying Environment Safeguards to Rural Energy I Project, The potential impacts of the
Project are described in Table 4.1.

4.3. PROJECT'S IMPACT ON PROTECTED AREAS
As it was reported in Section 2.3, the Project will be carried out in San Sa Ho
and Lao Chai commune of Hoang Lien Son- Sa Pa nature reserve of Lao Cai
province. In Ha Giang province, the Thuong Tan commune (the Project commune),
Bac Me district is located in Pac Me proposed nature reservc.
4.3.1. HOANG LIEN SON - SAPA NATURE RESERVE
Conservation status
Hoang Lien Son- Sa pa Nature Reserve is located in San Sa Ho, Lao Chai, Ta Van
and Ban Ho commune, Sapa district, Lao Cai province. Hoang Lien Son- Sa Pa
Nature Reser-ve (then called Nui Hoang Lien) was included in Decision NO 194/CT
of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, dated 9 August 1986 (MARD, 1997).
This decision decreed the establishment of a 5,000 ha nature reserve for the
protection of "high mountain forests, mono-Fokieiiia hodginisii stands and valuable
medicinal herbs" (Cao Van Sung, 1995). An investment plan, prepared in 1993,
defined a 29,845 ha nature reserve in Sa Pa and Than Uyen districts (Anon, 1993). In
1997, the area in Than Uyen district was placed under the management of the Song
Da Watershed Protection Forest management board. An investment plan for the
revised nattre reserve was prepared in 1997, which gave the area of the nature
reserve as 19.991 ha (Nguyen Quang Hung et al.1997). Te boundary of the nature
reserve was revised again in 1998 to include areas in Ban Ho commune, and the area
of the nature reserve calculated from a digitized version of the current boundary is
24,658 ha (Tordoff et al. 1999).
Topography and hydrology
Hoang Lien Son- Sa pa Nature Reserve is located in the Hoang Lien Son
mountains, which are an extension of the Ailao Shan mountains in China, thle south-
eastern extent of the Himalayan chain. The nature reserve is located on the north-east
flank of these mountains and includes Vietnam's highest peak, Mount Fansipan
(3,143 m). The lowest point is 380 m but most of the nature reserve lies above 1,000
m. the flanks of the mountains are very steep. Between Mount Fansipan and Sa Pa
town, lies the Muong Hoa valley, whiclh becomes wider towards the east of the nature
reserve (Tordcff et al. 1999).
HoIang Lien Son- Sa Pa Nature Ikeserve is drained by the Muong lloa and Tia Trulng
I-lo rivers, whiichi feed the Nanl Po river and, finally, the Red River. Forest in the
nature reserve has an essential role in water catchments protection, particularly forest
at high elevations, which captures water by condensation and contributes it to stream
flow (Tordoff et al. 1999).
Biodiversity value
Hoang Lien Son - Sa Pa Nature Reserve contains 11,071 ha of natural forest
(Tordoff et al. 1999). Variations in altitude, topography, hydrology and micro-
27
I1



l
l
climate within the nature reserve have produced a wide variety of habitat types,
which can be broadly classified into scrub, savanna, submontane deciduous forest,
sub-alpine forest and dwarf bamboo (Tordoff et al. 1999). Plant species richness
(2,024 known species of vascular plants) and levels of endemism (one quarter of
Vietnam's endemic species) are both very high relative to other protected areas in
Vietnam (Nguyen Nghia Tlin and Nguyen Thi Thoi 1998). For these reasons, the site
was selected as a Center for Plant Diversity by the IUCN Plant Conservation
Programme (Davis et al. eds. 1995).
Mammal diversity and abundance are relatively low as a result of intensive
hunting pressure. However, Hoang Lien Son - Sa Pa Nature Reserve supports a high
diversity of other animal groups. Three hundred and forty seven bird species have
been recorded in and around the nature reserve, including several species that are
endemic to the area. Invertebrate's diversity is also very high, and many species of
invertebrates discovered at the site are known from nowhere else in the world
(Tordoffet al. 1999)
In the Biodiversity Action Plan for Vietnam, Hoang Lien Son- Sa Pa Nature
Reserve is rated "A" for biodiversity value (the highest rating) (Government of
SRV/GEF 1994).
Conservation issues
Over-exploitation of natural resources, together with clearance of land for
cultivation and by accidental fire, is rapidly destroying the natural vegetation cover
of Hoang Lien Son- Sa pa Nature Reserve. Already, natuLral forest covcrs less than
half the area of the nature reserve, and continued human disturbance threatens those
areas that remain. Where forest has been cleared or bunnt, soil fertility has decreased,
and it will be a long time before the forest regenerates (Tordoff et al. 1999).
Cardamom   Anzomwlitn1 aron7aticwan cultivation, timber extraction and the
collection of non-timber forest product are leading to detcrioration in forest quality
and changes in species composition. However, the long- term effects of these
activities wiII be less severe as, firstly, some canopy cover remains, and, secondly,
nutrients arc not lost through erosion. If these activitics cease, the forest may be able
to rccovcr rlcativcly rapidly (Toldoff et al. 1999).
The natulC reserve has bccn established andid a managemcnt board has been
formlcd. A hcadquarters building has been built, the boundaries of the naturc reserve
I                have been demarcated, and signboards have been posted displaying nature reserve
regulations. The staff of the nature reserve is currently implementing fire-prcvention
activities. 'rhey are also implementing forest management schemes to a greater or
lesser degree. However, beyond fire prevention and social forestry, the nature reserve
staff does not have any resources to enforce nature reserve regulations, although a
28
I 



request for funding for this and other activities has been submitted to central
I                 government and is awaiting a response (Tordoff et al. 1999).

environmental impacts are similar as impacts shown in Table 4. 1. Rural
I                 distribution network will be mainly constructed along the existing rural roads.
Trees that will be cut by Project are mainly bamboos and fruit tree. The

Mitigation measures proposed by this EMP are adequate to control and
minimize the impacts caused by Project in these sensitive communes in term
of protection of biodiversity in Protected area.
4.3.3. BAC ME PROPOSED NATURE RESERVE AND THUONG TAN
COMMUNE
Conservation status
In 1994, Ha Giang provincial DERD prepared an investment plan for
I                 Bac Me, which proposed establishing a 27,800 ha Special-use Forest,
comprising a strict protection area of 9,450 ha, a forest rehabilitation area of
17,125 ha and an administration and service area of 1,225 ha. This investment
plan was approved by MARD, by Official Letter No. 88/NL-TL dated 8
March 1994, and by Ha Giang Provincial People's Committee, by Decision
No 143/UB-QD dated 22 April 1994. Following this, a management board
was established by the provincial people's committee on 24 November 1994
(Bac Me Forest Enterprise 2000).
The precise Special-use Forest category of Bac Me is not clear. Bac Me
Forest Enterprise (2000) states that the site is both a nature reserve and a
cultural and historical sire. However, Bac Me is included on the 2010 list as a
27,800 ha nature reserve, including 14,768 ha of forest (FPD 1998). The site
is currently under the management of the provincial DARD (Bac Me Forest
Enterprise 2000).
|                 Topography and hydrology
Bac Me proposed nature reserve is situated in Bac Me district in south-
I                 eastern Ha Giang province. The topography of the proposed nature reserve is
mountainous, and there are several peaks above 1000 m, the highest of which
is 1,420 m, on the border with Tuyen Quang province. The lowest point in the -
proposed nature reserve is less than 200m.
Stream originating in the north and west of the proposed nature reserve
feed the Gam river, which flows south, into Tuyen Quang province, and
eventually meets the Lo river. Streams originating in the south-east of the
proposed nature reserve feed the Pao Nam river, a tributary of the Gam river.
Biodiversity value
So far there is no exact informnation on biodiversity value of the Bac Me
Proposed Nature Reserve.
Conservation issues
A total of 6,443 people live inside the proposed nature reserve. The majority
I                 of these people belong to the Hmong, Tay and Dao ethnic groups. These
people practice both fixed and shifting cultivation inside the proposed nature
reserve: there are 411 ha of wet rice land and 884 ha of hill agricultural land
30

inside the boundary of the proposed nature reserve. Bac Me proposed nature
I                  reserve only has two members of staff and a single guard station (Bac Me
Forest Enterprise 2000).

During project preparation stage (2004), the following activities were carried out:
Activity 1: Information & Discussion with Local Authorities on the Line Route
Activity 2: In-pact Survey and Statistics
U                 Activity 3: Meetings with PAHs
When the survey was completed, District Compensation Committee (in
coordination with the commune officials) held meetings with PAHs having land in
*                 the line ROW and with village representatives. During the meetings, the Consultant
presented numerous materials, including: Project Summary, draft RAP and draft EIA,
maps of the project site, figures, tables, photos, pictures, and other support materials.
Meeting officials informed participants of the Project purpose; prescnted the Project
impacts on land and crops in detail; introduced the principles and policies of
compensation and advised people not to build new structures in the line ROW. PAHs
xvere consulted on the entitlement policy, property affected, and the compensation
amount to each household. Questions posed by the PAHs were addressed and
recommendations/concerns of PAHs and PCI were recorded.
Activity 4: Receiving Further Feedback from PAHs
Activity 5: Public disclosure and Clearance on EIA
The Project will receive an investment license only after appropriate modification of
location, design, capacity and/or technology of the project to meet the requirement of
environmental protection and resettlement. To address disclosure requirements of
OP 4.01, PCI will:
|  Provide Vietnamese-language copies of the EIA report, RAP, and Project
Summary to each commune-level and provincial-level People's Committee in
the Project area.
|  Advertise in major local newspapers several times over a two-month period.
The advertisement will state the EIA, RAP, and Project Summary is available
for public review for a two month period during normal working hours at the
followving locations: 1) the provinicial-levcl Pcoplc's Committccs; anl 2) Thc
commune1LllC lcvcl Icoplcs' Comm1ittecs.
|  Englislh and ViCtnamese-language copics of tlhe  IA report will also bc sClnt to
the Vietnam Information Developmenit Centre at 63 Ly Thai To in Hanoi, for
access by NGOs and public.
I                English language copies of the EIA report will be sent to World Bank for publication
on World Bank Info Shop.

|l                    people can have a plan to harvest agricultural products in their affected lands.
- Pole should not be erected in the gate of houses
| - Warning sign for power pole system should be hang on
- Avoid carrying out construction work in steep sites to avoid soil erosion.
- Project owner should pay compensation before construction period.
- Contractors and Consultants should inform soon about land acquisition so affected
peoples can have their working plan in un- affected land
| - Consultants should carefully consider the pole's position; avoid erecting the pole
inside garden, near houses, or residential areas.
- Related parties should consider reducing the electricity tariff for farmers in this
3                     area.
