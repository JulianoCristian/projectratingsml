Compensation will be at substitution rates\n            or market prices. Compensation for houses, buildings, and\n            trees must be at replacement cost regardless of\n            depreciation. All PAPs are entitled to compensation and\n            rehabilitation whether or not they hold legal entitlements\n            to the land. No households will have to resettle because\n            removed houses will be reconstructed on land near the\n            original site. Households with houses demolished in part\n            will be compensated in cash at the substitution rate. The\n            total amount of compensation issued to the household has to\n            equal the cost of materials and labor needed to reconstruct\n            the demolished section of the house. If demolition of the\n            damaged section damages the remaining sections of the house,\n            compensation will be added to pay the cost of repairs. PAPs\n            losing agricultural lands will be compensated in cash or opt\n            for land for land compensation. Compensation for crops will\n            be given in cash at current market rates calculated on the\n            productive average of the last three years. Compensation for\n            trees will be provided in cash at substitution rates. In\n            addition to direct compensation for losses, PAPs will\n            receive other subsidies."}, "docdt": "2005-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
