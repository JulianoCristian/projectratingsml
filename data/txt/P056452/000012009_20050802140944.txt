7The First Ruiral E)iergy Project RE I - Phlase 3
1.    INTRODUCTION
1.1.  The project:
1.    Dak Nong is a newly established province which is separated from Dak Lak Province.
Some of the villages and hamlets of the province still do not have electricity, which is causing
many problems for local people. This sub-project of Rural Energy I (Phase 3), using WB
loans, is part of the nationl electrification, contributinig to the poverty alleviagtion, by building
the electricity infrastructure in the rural areas.
The objectives of the sub-project is to reduce loss of electricity, increase availability of
electricity for the remaining hamlets of Dak Nong Province. The specific objectives of the
sub-project are:
a) rehabilitation and maintenance of the existing rural powver network to provide
sufficient electricity for the socio-economic developnient of the province in the
coming 15-20 years, to thle year 2020.
b) Increasing reliability and quality of the power network, decreasing loss of
electricity, reducing productioni cost, increasing the efficiency of the business and
the management of lectricity, and ensuring the recovery of the investment capital.
The acquisition of land for the implementation of the sub-project is inevitable,
however, this will not occur in a large scale. This ethnic minority development plan
(EMDP) is designed to ensure compensation for impacts and to recover and enhance
life of people affected by the sub-project in Dak Nong province.
2.    The project proposes using a WB's fund for rehabilitation and expansion of rural local
power systems in 37 hamlets of Dak Nong Province.
The Dak Nong subproject includes t\\wo major comlponents:
(i)      building of neNv distribution line and 22/0.4 KV distribution substation, to
be implemented by EVN;
*                    (ii)     (ii) building of newv LV 0.4 distribution line, to be implemented by EVN
The distributioni line is expected to go thlrouglh thle areas of II communles in 5 districts
of Dak Nong.
1.2.   The Ethnic Minority Development Plan (EMDP)
1.    Since the Dak Nong subproject is located in the areas of Ethnic Minorities, every
special effort has been and will be made through design, construction measures and
construction schedules to reduce unnecessary involuntary resettlement and adverse impacts on
Ethnic Minorities. Nevertheless, some land acquisition is unavoidable. There are ethnic
minorities to be negatively affected in the 7 project's communes. Out of the total 1852
households affected by the project, there are 987 households with 5112 persons mainly of
Mnong, Tay, Nung, Dao, Thai, Mong, Muong, Ede to be impacted.
2.    In fact, the rehabilitation/expansion of thie distribution line only imposes the adverse
impacts on individuals and at low-intensity. The most of impacts on land of Ethnic Minorities
Nvill be temporary, some families of Ethnic Minorities will be permanently acquired land for
constructing of towers/poles and substations. Therefore, the project subcomponents would
not cause any culturally specific impact on the affected ethnic minority households and the
nature of impacts does not result in community-wide socio-economic effects.

7The First Rural Energy Prq/ect RE I - Phase 3
3.    In the case of Dak Nong subproject, the WB's policy on Indigenous People requires a
preparation of an EMDP to ensure that
(i) the development process fosters full respect for their dignity, human rights, and cultural
uniqueness, and
(ii) the ethnic minorities do not suffer adverse effects during development process, and that
(iii) they receive culturally compatible social and economic benefits.
4.    This EMDP document, along with the Dak Nong Resettlement Plan (RP), has been
developed in line with the guidelines of the WB's OD 4.20 and Vietnam legislation on Ethnic
Minorities. It was prepared parallel with the Feasibility Study of the RE I project and aimed to
ensure that the WB's OD 4.20 policy objectives to be met. The preparation of the EMDP has
been based on results of RRA and extensive interviews and discussions with local
stakeholders of different levels - authorities, mass organizations, and ethnic minorities
impacted people in all the EM communes to obtain basic information and feedbacks from
them towvard the project, its possible impacts, especially adverse effects on the local ethnic
minorities, their proposed measures to mitigate project negative impacts and increase social
and economical benefits for local ethnic minorities.
II.   SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OF ETHNIC MINORITIES IN
THE PROJECT'S AREAS
111. Population and Ethnic composition
1. Ethnic minorities in project areas
By Census of 2003, among the total provincial population of 387,889 people, 49% is
female and 51% is male. T'he plrovincC consists of 31 diflerenl groups, but of whlich only six,
including Kinh, Mnong, Tay, Nung, Thai and Ede have sizable population. The Kinh present
65.5 %, Mnong 9.7 %, while the otlhers occupy smaller percentages. The way of life of the
ethnic groups is very similar to that of Kinh people, in terms of patterns of farming, and other
social institutions.
In these ethnic areas there are still a lot of age-old customs and practices, however, the
production and many aspects of life is very much wvithin the management of local authorities.
In the EM communilies, only the Mnong and Ede have their own scripts, therefore the
dominant language of these ethnic groups is Vietnamese.
FolloNving is description of customiis of some EMs:
The Tay
Denomination:      7ay
Other name:        7ho
Small local groups:  P1hen7, 7hu. Lao, lPa Di, Ngani
Language:          7ay - 7hai
Areas of habitations: Along a belt from Quang Ninh province to Lao Cai and Yen Bai
provinces via Cao Bang. Bac Thai, Tuyen Quang, Ila Giang and also scattered in Dien Bien
Phu (Lai Chau province) and in Lam Dong and Dak Lak provinces. The 7'ay are indigenous to
their present area of habitation.

The First Rural EuieyV Project RE I - I'lase 3
Material life:
Housinig
A  7ay village on average has 40-50 houses (maximum 100) built at the foot of a
mountain or hill, or near a river or stream. The ban (village) in the upper region of Cao Bang
and Lang Son are generally surrounded by a bamboo hedge in the same way as those of the
Viet. The houses of ban in the frontier regions are often protected against interlopers by a
stone wall along with a ditch.
The houses are on stilts with a two-flap or four-flap roof of palm leaves, tiles and
thatch. The interior is divided into two by a partition, the rear section serving as a bedroom
and kitchen, the front part is used for reception and study room for the children. The altar for
the worship of the ancestors is also located in the front part. The columns are made of tree
trunks and supported by stones. The wooden floor extend outwards from the four sides of the
houses and forms a kind of balcony with handrail all around. House of clay wvith tilted roofs
have made an appearance and become more and more numerous.
Dresses
Men clothes are dyed witli indigo and are similar to those of neighboring ethnic
groups.
Women generally a scarf knotted in a way to form a 'crow's bill' on the forehead, a
four-paneled dress split at the sides up to the armpits, and silk belt knotted at thle back with
both ends hanging down. Women of Phen group wear an indigo skirt and short vest in white.
The vests of young Pa Di group women are decorated at the front by beehive-shaped silver
buttons. Women like to wear silver earrings, necklaces and bracelets around their wrists and
ankles.
Culti vat ion
The T7y mainly cultivate wvet rive, their staple food. Techniques are fairly advanced
and catching up with those of the Viet, including an effective irrigation system. Market
gardening is a recent innovation, however, the 7ay have been engaging in producing specific
crops i.e. anise (in Lang Son), soya bean (in Cao Bang and Lang Son), cinnamon (in Yen
Bai), high value trees for timber and tea (in Bac Thai and Ha Giang) and tobacco (in Cao
Bang and Lang Son). They also grow cotton, indigo plant, fruit trees (peaches, apricot,
tangerine), chestnut and other crops. The Tay have long experience in the growing of bamboo
used as building material and in basketry.
Animal husbandry
Animal raising is quite developed in the Taly communities. Their farm yards are crowded wvith
poultry and pigs; oxen and buffaloes are left to wander in the valleys and are brought back
only at the ploughing time. The Nuoc Hai horses (Cao Bang), That Khe duck (Lang Son) and
Trung Khanh duck (Cao Bang) Bao Loc ox (Cao Bang) and pigs from Lang son are known
throughout the country.
Fish rearing in ponds and lakes is also a specialty for the Thy communities.
Handicr-afts
Handicrafts are fairly sophisticated and satisfy the local requirenhents. Surplus items are used
for exchange. Brocade (Cao Bang) is a popular artifact in the domestic market and also
becoming an important export item. Barter is a feature mainly prevailing in the border
markets.

Social and Family Relationship
Prior to 1945, the 7ay society was already sophisticated, but not uniformly. In the
basins of the Gam, Lo, Chay and Hong (Red) rivers, the tho try (the administration appointed
by the feudal court) were in existence right up to 1954. These ,/wo is t;r (plIng) were
hereditary. They appropriated all the land and turned the peasants into serfs. The people wvere
divided into two categories: free peasants who cultivated communal lands but had to fulfill
obligations towards the village, pay dues to the lords and perform corves and semi-free
peasants who had to perform corves and offer tribute to the lords in retu-n for tlhe riglht of
residence and the benefits from a piece of land. During these old days, the "droit de cuissage"
(the right of a feudal lord to abuse a bride before the husband) was maintained as well as the
custom of burying alive any notables wvho had served the lord upon the latter's death. In other
regions, class differentiation evolved in the same way as on the plains, the influence of this
being typical: a minority of land owners, a stratum of rich peasants, a larger stratum of middle
peasants, the poor peasants who make up the majority of the working people, practically not
landless people. The area of land in private hands is larger than that of the communal land.
The patriarchal, monogamous family constitutes the basic unit of 7ay in traditional
society, but a wider network of relationships is respected in the veneration of ancestors, in
customs and practices, and in the settlement of disputes among members of the same line. The
father decides all family matters. The eldest son is his designated successor. Women play a
secondary role are taken into account only in the area of romantic sentiment.
However, vestiges of maternity can still be found, such as respect of members of the
wife's family and for matemal uncles, a married couples living with the bride's family - still
seen in Ha Giang, Tuyen Quang and Bac 'I'hai provinces. Exogamy is rule, but marriage is
often a matter of buying and selling, and must be in accordance with convention. The greater
part of a family inheritance is given to the eldest son. The latter's children, irrespective of age,
are always accorded greater consideration tlhal those ofhis younger brothers.
Rites involved marriages, funerals and the naming of newv-bor-n babies follow Confuciani
prescriptions. Except a few details, they are similar to those of the Viet. The 7ay family live
in harmony and parents are not very strict with their children. Divorce is rare.
The Tay live separately in their communes and villages, among their own ethnic
group. Nowadays, they mix up with the population of the village or hamlet and take up
employment in the remote regions. Some are married to members of other ethnic groups.
Funerals are similar to those of the Viet in many respects.
Spiritual life
The 7ay, like the Viet, are influenced by Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism.
Villagers venerate genies of the earth and hearth. The earth genie is worshipped in a sanctuary
or at tlhe foot of a banyan tree. Local deities are wvorshipped in a secluded forest area or on the
top of a mountain considered sacred and called the "forest or mount of the gods". In their
temples, the 7ay wvorship all the deities of the three religions, the spirit of the river, that of the
mountain and other local spirits. On the altars of the ancestors, many families venerate
Confucius, the Buddha and Kwan Yin. Ceremonies and rites are inspired by the Tho Mai Gia
Le, a book defining the marriage, funeral and childbirth rituals followed by the ancient Viet.
Agrigarian rituals are performed mainly at the beginning of spring, when the agricultural
cycle starts. Depending on the region, the 7'ay organize ceremonies and feasts on the occasion
of "going to the fields" celebratinig the moon, wvorkinig on the mountain, hens laying eggs to
express gratitude and pray to the genies for fertility, property, happiness, health and luck. It is
also an opportunity for young people to express their feelings before starting a new cycle of
7



7The First Rt-al Eneirg Pro?ject RE I - I'licase 3
production. The culture of the 7av has been deeply influenced by the Viet culture due to their
long-standing co-existence. Art and literature saw an early flowering with the creation of the
Nom-7ay written language (the 7ay demotic script inspired by Chinese characters) and the
emergence of such authors as Quan Nac and Quynh Van as early as the 16h and 17th
centuries. The poems of Do Hau criticized the society of the end of the 19"' century and the
beginning of tlhe 201' century. Many wvorks in Nom-Tay appeared: the long poems of Nam Kinl
- 7hi Dan. Luoong Quan - Biooc Roin and others. Stories adapted from those of Viet or the
Chinese such as Tong Clian - Cuc Hoa, Plhan Tai - Ngoc Hoa, Kim Van Kieu, Luong Son Ba
Chuc An/h Dai, such legends as those of Nung Tri Cao and Nung Van Can, the Tav heroes
who led uprisings against Chinese feudalism and aggression; and myths such as Pu Luong -
Gia Cai, the first two ancestors of hlumial, and the cdisjute over the royal throne by nin2e
princes. Particular noteworthy is the humorous tales and fables of important educational
value.
7ay folklore also has the Iuon, a kind of duet between lovers comparable to the hat
chun of the Viet or sli and k/hap of the Nung and 7Thai. The luon comprises several tunes: the
hion then, the nang hai, the hion sluonig of Cao Bang and Lang Son provinces, the luon k/lap
of Lao Cai and Yen Bai provinces. The luon of the 7Ty lhas its rules and codes like the quaan
ho Bac Ni,i/z of the Viet or the han7 kh/uong of the 7 hai.
There is also a kind of story in verse the contents of wvhich are similar to those of the
luon: it is recited in the same manner as the Viet poems.
The then or nuptial song is a very rich and very popular genre. Musical instruments
and dances, however, are limited in scope and among the 7Ty as compared with other ethnic
groups. Entertainmenits and plays, by contrast, are numerous, including the lion dance, stick
dance, water puppets, chess, spinning tops, the khang or tip-cat play, the throwing of con (a
kind of large shuttlecock) and kite flying (using typical 7ay kites). The 7ay-Nung written
language has recently been Romanized and is taught in schools along with Vietnamese. Books
and newspapers in Tay-Nung are published widely in Toy-Nung regions.
The Nuig
Denomination:     Nung
Small local groups:  Nung Khen Lai, Nung Giang, Nung An, Nung Inh, Nung Loi, Nung
Phlan Sin/h, Nung Chaoo, Nung Quy rin. Nung Xuong. Nung Di)i, Nung Tung Sliui
Language:          7ay-Thai
Area of habitation:  Mainly in Cao Bang and Lang Son provinces
The Nung live togetlher wvith the 7ay.
A number of Nung now live in HCMC, Dong Nai, Lam Dong and Dak
Lak
Material life
Housing
Depending oni the group and locality, the Nung house is built either level with the ground or
half on stilts witlh clay walls and a tiled group. In tlle past, men lived on the first floor (if tile
house was on stilts), and cattle and poultry were below and agricultural produce and tools
were kept in a granary up near the roof. Today, the house is larger and well ventilated while
the space below is reserved for farming implements. Wood is also kept there, the cattle having
been removed to shreds built some distance rrom the main house.
The Nung house, by contrast with that of the 7Thai, is divided into two parts widthwise. In the
front part is located the altar to the ancestors and visitors are received there. The back part is
used as bedroom and kitchen.

The First Rturail EneqX lProject RE I - Phase 3
Dresses
In general, the Nung, especially women, all dress in the same wvay, vith only slight
differences depending on locality. Men wear an indigo vest with military collar, buttoned at
the front like neighbouring ethnic groups in the highland regions of northern Vietnam. The
Nung An adopt five-paneled vest buttoned at the right. Women also wear a five-paneled vest
buttoned at the side, shorter than that or the 'Ty and depending on the group. A small round
or oval cushion protects the vest wvhen something heavy is to be carried on the shoulder and
an apron is attached at the front when the men are working. Today, young people prefer
European-style shirts and trousers. Elderly people still cling to the traditional costume.
Cultivation
The Nung, long-standing cultivators, intensively utilize submerged fields. But due to the
shortage of land, they also cultivate terraced field and burnt over land. Farming techniques are
more advanced than those of neighbouring ethnic groups. They have always used manure
particularly that of animal origin. They do not transplant rice seedlings or grow anotlher crop
in winter. They build low walls (Im high) around their terraced fields. The crops cultivated in
tums throughout the year on burnt-over land and in the gardens are quite varied: com, canary-
seed, peanuts, vegetables and sweet potatoes to overcome the pre-harvest food shortages.
They all have kind of vegetables at family meals throughout the year. Bamboo, fruit trees,
anise and lacquer trees grow in many gardens. The Nung are considered as thie best gardeners
in Vietnam.
For some decades now, the Nung have been transforming the burnt-over land into terraced
rields and reorganizing their submerged fields by means of small and medium-sized irrigation
works.
Animal husbandrly
Animal raising (cattle and poultry) is only a secondary activity but well developed. Each
family has its own poultry yard with chickens, ducks, geese, pigs and buffaloes. The Nung
also rear fish in the submerged rice-fields.
Handicrafts
Handicrafts are a continuing activity, particularly weaving to supply local needs. Each woman
has her own loom and plot of land to grow cotton and indigo. The cloth is dyed several times
and then beaten until its surface becomes glossy. Old clothes are often re-dyed. Carpentry, the
production of bricks and tiles, jars, jugs, paper, and cotton thread, silver-artifacts, basketry
and so on are seen in many villages.
All vitally needed items are produced in sufficient quantity for local consumption and
exchange, except salt. Artisani activities flourish, particularly in the slow periods of
agricultural calendar. Blacksmithing takes place all year round. The Nung An is famous for
this in Cao Bang and Tuyen Quang provinces.
Social and Family relationship
In the past, the Nung live in scattered hamlets and villages. They are tending to come together
to form larger population centers. In the village, horses are not built in accordance with any
particular plan; their arrangement varies with local topology. The pathways are narrow and
winding. Surrounding the house is generallv a garden where fruit trees are growni including
pear, plum, orange, grapefruit and banana. Huts have recently begun to be built for
handicrafts such as basketry, blacksmithing and woodworking as well as for providing shelter
for cattle and pigs.
The Nung has a deeply-felt sense of ethnic identity and great loyalty to local chiefs and elders.
Their society has experienced some class differentiation. There are no communal lands and
9



7/we First Rtrral ErneXg Project REI - Phla(se 3
private land is the result of individual land reclamation.
In the village, patriarchal nuclear families form the basic unit of society. Issues relating to
inheritance and marriage are as men's business. Marriage is seen as a business matter and the
expense incurred are very high. Once married, a woman is completely dependent on her
husband and parent-in-law. Confucianism demands the maintaining of a rigorous distance a
woman and her father-in-law and brothers-in-law.
Spiritual life
The Nung are close to the 7lay in respect of ancestor worship, festival rituals and annual
ceremonies. As followers of Buddhism, they wvorship Kwan Yin. A Buddhist altar is placed
above the altar to the ancestors which is the most sacred place. They pray for the protection
from the Buddha against natural calamities which threaten to crops or when someone is taken
ill. They refrain from eating beef, buffalo meat and dog meat. Belief in the existence of a
genie of the earth is still so strong that outside the home of every Nung is an altar to it.
Some superstitious practices persist, particularly among the poor who appeal, for instance, to
the thay mo (sorcerer) to perform exorcisms in the event of illness or accident. The latter are
among the rare individuals who know the Nung demotic wvriting use in the preparation of
prayer books.
The Nung literary and artistic heritage is very rich. Very popular are alternative songs (sli)
and marriage songs (co lau). The melodies and lyrics vary from one group to another. The
extol nature and tale of the sufferings of the people from oppression and injustice in
traditional society. The sli speak of love and express hope for a better future. Singing the sli
has been a popular custom; young and old, men and women- everyone sings the sli,
especially on market days.
Other aspects of Nung art are very close to those of the 7ay.
The MAionig
The Mnong is one of the indigenous inhabitants of thie country, who live in the soutlhwest Dak
Lak, Dak Nong, Lam Dong, Song Be. They have low posture, thick lips and pale black
complexion.
Their language belongs to the Mon-Khmer group. The Mnong is typical of the inhabitants of
the hoe-using agriculture in Central Highland. Their economny relies mainly on farming on
hilly fields.
Material life
The clearing up of forest for cultivation normally takles place in the first days of the year, after
a number of farming rituals. Burning trees to clear up land for cultivation is the most
important wvork for the Mnong.
The Mnong build rice bams inside their house, on the yard and on the rice (mountain) field.
They rely on natural features such as the banlk of a stream, the foot of a mountain etc. so
determine the border the divides pieces of land for cultivation which belong to households or
villages.
The Mnong have self-supply trades such as groNving cotton, veaving cloth, and wveaving of
bamboo products.
When a family decides on building a newv house the whlole village wvill come to help in terms
of labour, material and food.
Mnong villages are usually situated along rivers or streams, so as to be near sources of wvater
for daily use. A village usually consists of about ten long houses, rarely with high trees and
gardens around.
10



Thle First Rt-al ergy Pl'roject RE I - Plhase 3
A Mnong long house is the dwelling place for small families.
Dresses
Mnong women wear skirts and short shirts which are put on through the head and are
tightened around the body. Mnong men wvear long loin-cloth which reaches down and covers
the buttocks. They only wear these on Tet (New year) and festivals. They dress like the Kinh
in their everyday life.
The Mnong love to wear a lot ofjewelries made from bronze, silver, and string of beads.
Their principal means of transport is a papoose on the back.
Animal husbandily
Husbandry is very developed in the Mnong community. They raise a lot of poultry and pigs.
Cattle are let wandering in the valley and are only brought home when they are needed.
Family and social relations
Mnong is still basically a matriarchal family with children bearing mother's surname. The
man normally resides in the house of the wife's side, and in some places, the man resides at
the house of the wife's side for some time and the wife at the house of the man's side for
some time before they start to reside in their own house. Within the family women have
dominant roles and men are respected. Right of inheritance belongs to the youngest daughter.
Marriage in the Mnong community is taken care of mainly by the bridegroom's family. They
have the custom of having an abstaining Nveek after the wedding day during they do not
receive visitors. Polygamy and divorce are rare.
The Mnong believe that death is denial of daily food and go to the other world to live with
their ancestors. According to this belief, the dead also need property as when they were alive.
That is why dead people are given their share of property and are given objects at their burial,
such as jar, terra-cotta pot, porcelain bowvl, bracelet, dried bacu (to be used as a container), etc.
In the village when someone dies, everybody else will stop all their work in the field to take
care of the dead person and give a hand in making arrangement for the funeral. Dead people
are buried in the graveyard of the village. The mourning lasts from a week to a month. They
do not have the custom of reburial.
Spiritual life
The religion of the Mnong is related to agriculture, and they believe that everything has a
soul. They believe in the wicked god and the good god.
The Mnong still do not have a script for their language.
The Ede
The Ecde are also long-standing indigenous inhabitants in Dak Lak, Dak Nong. Some still live
in Gia Lai - Kontum and in mountainous areas of Phu Yen and Khanh Hoa provinces. They
are more commonly addressed as Anak Edcle.
As is true of other ethnic minorities in Central Highland, the population growth rate is the E,-de
is small.
Material life
In the traditional farming of the Elde, growing in the mountain field has a crucial role, which is
the main source of supply of food, and thle cultivation of rice on water paddy field occupies
1 1



T7he First Rural biergv Project RE I - IPhase 3
only a small percentage. On the mountain field, apart from rice, which is the main crop, there
are also corn, potato and cassava. The farming tools are simple, mainly hoe, stick to make
holes, pipes to contain seeds, rake, papoose, rice huskers.
Although the methods and tools of cultivation are simple, the harvests are relatively
satisfactory.
The Ede live on houses on stilts, made from bamboo, timber, and thatch-roofed, and built in
the nortlh-south direction. A typical house has two doors, with the front door for visitors and
males, the back door for females. The main room of the house is to receive visitors, and the
dine-in kitchen serves as the common room for the family where rituals and death anniversary
celebrations, etc, are held.
Animal husbandry
Almost every family raises a lot of poultry, and dozens of pigs, buffaloes and oxen.
Due to a favorable environment, hunting plays a crucial role in the life of the Ede. When an
animal is caught they normally share it among the member of the community to enjoy and to
celebrate the luck togetlher. In their everyday life they eat wild vegetables, honey, fruits, and
ihev use bamboo and timber for building.
Handicrafi
The Ecle do forging, pottery, and weaving of bamboo products
Dresses
Although there are local groups, the Ede have similar dresses. Women wear long skirts and
shirt put on through the neck. Men wear long shirts and loin-cloth. Women wear a lot of
bronze and silver jewelries. They wear traditional dresses on Tet celebration or other
ceremonial occasions. In everyday life they dress like most Kinh people.
Family and social relationships
The community spirit of the Ede can be seen in their readiness to help one another in
production and in everyday life. Tlhey also help one anotlher in funerals and weddings.
When someone dies the whole hamlllet will stop all the work to help with the funeral.
The Ecde followv a matriarchal structure w\ith tlhe wvife having a dominant role over the husband
and children. They live in long houses.
Marriage between the wife's siblings and the husband's siblings is rather popular, wvhich the
ELde believe to mainlain the continuilty of the family line.
Spiritual life
The Ede traditionally believe that soil and water have thieir separate gods, but that all the gods
ivork closely together to govemr nature.
The Edce have rich literature and arts, for example, designs on clotl, wood engravings, designs
on wood, gong music. folk songs, bamboo musical instruments, etc.
The 7thai,
Denomination:      7'hai
Small local groups:  Black 7hai, White T'hai
Language:          7ay-7hoai
Area of habitation:  Mainly in Son La, Lai Chau, Thanh Hoa provinces. Some are living In
Dak Lak and Dak Nong provinces

Material life:
Houses
The 7'hai live in ban (hamlet) and muong (village). Each ban has its own name, depending
local legends and the title of the head of the ban. Each ban has about 40-50 houses.
It may vary with different local group and areas, but most 7hai houses are made from wood
on stilts, very solid and beautiful, and are built following traditional patterns which are
handed over from generation to generation.
The roofs houses of Black 7hai have the shape of tortoise-shell at two ends. And the roofs of
houses of White T'hai are rectangular in shape and there are rails in the front or around the
house.
The 7'hai do not have a lot or household utensils and therefore, looks spacious and ventilated.
At present the Thai tend to follow the Kinh and change to live in houses built on the ground
or half on stilts.
Dresses
Generally speaking, the 7'hai dresses are very much alike, particularly for women, with only
small local differences . Women dresses are beautiful, tidy, not sophisticated, and are to
enhance nice traits of the woman figure. The choice of color is delicate, with elegant designs
and patterns, very unique of the 7hai.
At present, 7'hai men tend to like to wear European clothes, and women tend to keep to
traditional dresses.
Cuhtivationl
The Thai have a long-standing cultivation, with rice grown in submerged fields as a main
crop. But due to shortage of land, they also cultivate on terraced and mountain fields.
The 77lai have more advanced farming techniques than olher ethnic minorities in
neighbouring areas. They use muck, and do not transplant rice seedlings or grow non-rice
crops in winter. Thley make embankments about 1 m high around their terraced fields. They
have rotational crops of corn, groundnut, vegetables, potato, and therefore secure enough food
all year round. They grow bamboo trees, fruit trees, hoi, wvax tree in their gardens, and are
considered as good at gardening in Vietnam.
In recent years the Thai have moved from cultivating on mountain fields to terraced fields,
and have used small- and medium-scale irrigation for cultivation in submerged fields.
AniInal husbandri
Raising poultry is just secondary but has been very developed. Each household has its vard,
on which they raise chiicken, ducks, geese, pigs, buffaloes, oxen. They also raise fish in
submerged fields.
Handicrafi
Handicraft activities take place all year round, particularly of weaving cloth to satisfy the
needs of people in the hamlet. Each Nvoman has a loom, and some land to grow cotton and
indigo. Their cloth is dyed many times and is beaten until the surface shines. Thev also dve
their used clothes. The 7'hai brocade is unique with rich patterns. In some hamlets, the 7hai
also do carpentry, make bricks and tiles, and pottery.
All the basic goods for consumption and exchange are produced locally, except salt.
13



7'lre First Rtral Ene-gi' ProjecI RE I - PIlhase 3
Handicraft is very developed, particularly during between-crops time.
Family and social relations
In the 7'Iai society, land, fields, water sources, forests, all traditionally belonged to collective
ownerships. However, in some areas, they wvere occupied by the landlords. Nowadays they are
managed by the State, and the State distribute them to each household.
Each hamlet or village is home to a clan or a family line, and is associated with an animal or
an object which is worslhipped.
The Thai family is patriarchal, vith head of the family being the dominant figure. Women
have a lower status than men.
Monogamy is popular, and there has been greater equality betwveen men and wvomen in the
Thai society.
Spiritual life
The 7hai are very much like the Tay in terms of worshipping and rituals. They believe in
supematural powers wvho are governing their life. They believe in Then Luong, who governs
everything in heaven and on earth.
Some other religions and superstitions still exist, such as belief in ghost, spirit, and thav mo,
in treatment of illnesses. The 7'hai have rich cultural heritage. Legends play an important
role, together with tales about historical figures. The 7Thai also have rich folklore.
There are also some other ethnic minorities in the project areas, such as the Dao and the
Muong, but they are too small in number to describe here.
General speaking, all the ethnic minorities follow plans and arrangements made local
authorities in organizing their production activities.
Most children of ethnic families go to the same school as tlhe Kiinh. T'he ethnic minorities take
part in almost all cultural activities and share all economic opportunities and benefits in the
community as the Kinh people.
1.2.  In impacted cominmines
The results of screening and inventories of losses show that all the 1 1 project
communes of Dak Nong have ethnic minor-ities impacted due to temporary and/or permanent
loss of land and attached properties.
In the 5 districts of Dak Nong, most of the hamlets and villages where there are EM
people living already have electricity. Therefore, in this subproject, only 7 communes in 3
districts (Cu Jut, Dak Song, Krong No) have an EMDP. (see Table 2-1).

population. Details on their distributioni by EM  affected communes are given in tlhe
Appendixes.
The average househiold size of EM is a little bit bigger (4.7 per/HH) than that of Kinh
people (3.2 per/HI).
The results of the ethnic minority screening also show that in the impacted communes,
mainly Mnong. Tay, Nung, Dao, Mong, Muong and Ede ethnic minority groups are impacted.
Other ethnic minority groups live beyond the project impacted areas.

11.2.  General situation:
Dak Nong is a Central Highland province of Vietnam. In tihe last decade, Dak Nong
has made considerable achievements in economy; the annual GDP growth is 16.2%.
This rate in industry is 20.3%, in agriculture and forestry 5%, in commerce and service
17.6%. However, due to the fact tllat the main revenue still comes from agriculture, Dak Nong
remains one of the poorest provinces of Central Highland.
Like the comimioni situation in Vietnam. ethic minority groups in Dak Nong province
have enjoyed benefits of development and have quality of life being improved clearly.
However, they still lag far behlilid the Kinh due to manry reasons, including their traditionally
more or less closed social and economical systems; greater dependence on natural resource
base which is under depletion; generally lower education; more mouths to feed and lowver
economic start point... That's why special attention for them should be taken to ensure that
they will be treated fairly and they wvill benefits from the project development competitive
wvith their social and economic structures.
According to results of surveys, ethnic minorities in the affected communes often are
settled in groups, forming own hamlets. Somewhere, in some villages, one can see thleir
mixed settlements with Kinh people. The economy of the ethnic minority people still has
strong self-sufficient characteristics. They maintain specific features of their socio-economic
and cultural life from the othiers.
So far, ethnic minority people in the impacted communes still populariv dress tileir
ethnic traditional costumes and speak their own languages. As the youth and children today
go to school, they can speak Vietnamese, only the old generation may not be able to speak
Vietnamese.
17



71e IFirst Ruer,il 1h'tgtp Proqycl R/1?  I - I'Phae  3
In ethnic minority society. the old men play very important spiritual role in
community. They are very respected by villagers, being mental advisors, negotiators,
mediators and taking active part in decision-making process for different things and events in
the commune. They are always consulted about house building, marriages or other important,
common or households issues. To perform government policies, development programs, its
tasks and responsibilities, the local communities always strongly rely on cooperation with and
channeling information through the ethnic minority old men of villages.
Meanwhile, the integration with other ethllic group. including with Vietnamese
majority, also is a common tendency in the project EM communes, from which the local
minority people can gain benefits, upgrading their social and economical awareness and
improving their production skills and techniques...
11.3. Land use systems
Equally to the local Kinh, under Vietnam's Land Law, ethnic minorities' farmers in
Dak Nong have been allocated arable land and granted with long-term land use right
certificates. Etlnic minority people in all affected communes were allocated agricultural land
equally to the others too. They got an equal average size of wvet rice land as Kinh did. Besides,
they have some areas of upland fields for cultivation of upland crops. However, the arable
land in these, mostly mountainous, communes is very scarce, the HH's land holding is very
limited. This restrict possibilities for development of agriculture, creating great difficulties for
increasing income of the local population, including ethnic minority people.
As in the results of the long period of agricultural cooperation, all project communes
had passed collectivization, thus all land wvas belonged to cooperatives. Af.t.er Doi Nloi'-
arable land was evenly distributed to all farmers for long term agricultural use, so presently
there are not observed custom rights in local land use similar to that were in their traditional
agricultural systems.
11.4. Production
All the project EM communes are agricultural, wvhere all local HHs, both ethnic
minorities and the Kinh (Vietnamese) are engaged in cultivation, livestock and forestry.
Main local crops include both Nvet and upland rice, maize, cassava and some
vegetables. Besides, thie local ethnic minority people also grow industrial trees of high
economic value such as corfee, rubber tree, pepper tree, etc., to supply for the Dak Nong
markets.
Buffalos, pigs and poultry are traditional domestic animals in the communes.
However, livestock still is poorly developed anmong the local ethnic minority population. For
example, in Dak Wil Commune, among the Nung, Ede, and Tay, there only HHs, wlho have
above average income, breed buffalo and there only about 40% of Ede and Nung HHs raise
pigs. Chicken, ducks and other animals are bred in very limited number.
11.5.  Living standards and conditions
All the EM  affected communes have access road to the commune's center. All
communes have primary schools, kindergartens, cultural, telecommunication and health care
centers. Local people still rely on crops of coffee, rubber, pepper for their main sources of
revenue.  The  average  annual  income  is  3,720,000  VND/person  or  279.440
VND/month/person.

1L6. Education
The ethniic minorities in Dak Nong, like the common situation in Vietnam, are
benefited from preferential treatment in education systems, including exemption from
education fees in schools and preference in college admission. Howvever, illiteracy of the
adults still is very high among the ethnic minorities in Dak Nong as a wlhole and in the
affected communes as particular. The situation has been improved during the last years.
Today, the most of school-aged children in the mountainous districts of Central Highland go
to schools, only very fewv of them may not have education Nvhich is mainly caused by the HHs
economic situation.
111. LEGAL FRAMEWORK
This plan is developed based on OD 4.20 on Indigenous People of the World Bank
and Policies for EM of GOV.
Ill. 1. Vietnam Laws:
Article 5 of the Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (1992) reads:
"772e Socialist Republic of Vietnam is ihe uni ied .Sale of all nationalities living on the
territoty of Vietn2am. 7he SJate carries out a policy of equality, solidarity and mutual
assistance amnong all nationalities, and forbids all acts of national discrimination and
division. Every nationality has the right to use its own language and system of writing. to
preserve its national identitiy andl to prom7lote its fine custons, habits, traditions, an2d culture.
The State carries out a policy of compprehensive cdevelopment and gradually raises the
naterial and spiritual living conditions ol ihe national mninorities.
Article 94 in the Constitution states that the Ethnic People Committee has the riglht to
submit proposals, plans or related issues of indigenous peoples to the Assembly, monitor,
control the implementation of national policies, development programs on various areas such
as, education, health care, etc.
The presence of Ethnic People Council in the National Assembly and the Committee
for Ethnic Minorities and Mountainous Areas (CEMMA) in the Government together wvith
many programs addressing socio-economic and natural resource improvements - in remote,
upland and mountainous areas inhabited by ethnic minorities is evidence on consistent policy
of equality for and no discrimination against ethnic minorities, and commitments to improve
situation for its ethnic minorities, pursued by the State of Vietnam.
According to the Government of Viet Nam, ethnic minorities have the followving
characteristics:
-  An intimate understanding and long stay in the territory, land or area of their
ancestors closed attachment to the natural resources;
-  Self-identification and recognized by neighboring members by their distinctive
culture
-  A language different from the national language
-  A long traditional social and institutional svstem
-  A self-provided production system
20



The First Ruiral Dneigy Project RE I - Plhase 3
The most important government policies in relation to ethnic minorities have been:
Decision 327 of 15 September 1992, Instruction 525/TT of 2 November 1993, Decision
556/TT of 12 September 1995, Decision No. 661/QD-TTg of July 29, 1998, and finally
Decision 135/1998/QD-TTg.
Since 1968, the Govemment has promulgated resettlement policy for ethnic groups,
reducing migration trends of the ethnic people. The Government Guidance No.525/TTG on
2/11/1993 regarding in detail on implementation guiding of development in high land areas
and ethnic areas had the main followving points:
*  Develop infrastructure especially transportation road system and fresh water supplying
* Step by step overcome thle lack of food
* Consolidate of education system; adjust education program basing on characteristics of
provinces; create favor conditions and support the irregular education program and
develop internal economic force.
Decision 135/1998/QD-TTg, 1998, focus specifically on poverty alleviation for etlnic
minorities, based on promoting construction of small-scale infrastructure in poor ethnic
minority villages. The general objectives of this decree are: (a) rapidly improving not only the
material but also the life of ethnic milorities in extremely poor villages in mountainous and
remote areas; (b) creating better conditions for these rural areas in order to escape from
poverty, backward and slow development, (c) integrate the people in the general development
of the wvhole country; and (d) contributing to security, safety, and natural defense.
Among the goals for 1998-2005 are:
(i)   eliminating hunger and reducing poverty by 4-5% annually (and 25% by 2005),
(ii)  supporting infrastructure (domestic wvater supply, building vehicle roads to
commune centers, and promoting rural market development)
(iii)  encouraging children to go to school in righlt age, providing training to the
majority of ethnic minorities, enriching them wvith knowvledge and skills of
production, and
(iv)  controlling dangerous diseases.
111.2. WB's OD 4.20 on Indigenous People
The World Bank objective towvards ethnic minorities is to ensure that the development
process foster full respect for their dignity, human rights, and cultural uniqueness. At the
centre of the World Bank OD 4.20 is to ensure that ethnic minorities do not suffer adverse
effects during the development process, particularly from Bank-financed projects, and that
they receive culturally compatible social and economic benefits.
The World Bank's strategy for addressing the issues pertaining to ethnic minorities
must be based on the infor7ned participation of the ethnic minorities themselves. Thus
identifying local preferences through direct consultation, incorporation of indigenous
knowledge in project approaches, and appropriate early use of experienced specialists are core
activities for any project that affect ethnic minorities and their rights to natural resources.
Thus Vietnam's legal stated policy concerning ethnic minorities is similar in content to the
World Bank policy on Indigenous Peoples OD 4.20.

IV. PROJECT IMPACTS ON ETHNIC MINORITIES
IV.1. Land acquisition and resettlement impacts
The Dak Nong RE I (Phase 3) subproject doesn't cause a broad severe resettlement
impacts on etliimic minorities. It would impact on EM communities in 7 communes of 3
districts (Cu Jut, Dak Song, Krong No) of Dak Nong province. Tables 4-1 and 4-2 showv tile
summarized data on project's land acquisition and impacts oni ethnic minorities. More details
on project impacts on EM is given in the Annexes 1- 6.
IV 1.1. In)qacts oni Etlhniic miinlorities:
In total, 987 ethnic minority 1HHs (5, 112 persons) will be adversely impacted due to
permanent and/or temporary acquisition of land and loss of movable assets attached to the
affected land.
In total, the project land acquisition involves 30.67 ha, of which thlere only about 0.57
ha is lost permanently, while 30.1(0 ha is impacted temporarily. No any ethnic minority HHs
'Will be severely affected due to relocation or losing more than 10% of productive land or loss

IV. 1.4. Impact on crops anid trees
There are 987 EM HHs affected on trees and crops (mainly on rice, upland crops, fruit
and perennial trees).
IV.2. Project's positive impacts
To continue the Poverty Alleviation Program, the GOV Vietnam Govemment seeks
International Assistance. The WB funded RE I (Phase 3) Dak Nong Province project aims to
improve living conditions in rural areas, including the poorest and disadvantaged EM
communes, through provision of a basic infrastructure, the power supply, vhich is supposed
to contribute promotion of socio-economic activities in the areas.
According to results of consultation and focus group discussions, the local EM people,
like the majority Kinlh, express their views that they fully support the project investment, even
if they have to lose some their arable land. In their opinions, the proposed improved powver
supply service wvill rather bring benefits to them, positively impacting their living and
economic conditions, than pose negative impacts. Nvhich in fact are very minor. The local
authorities and people consulted in EM affected communes consider that the power supply
will improve their aNvareness and quality of life as they can have TV, radios to learn about
many things happening outsides of communes, get information on newv production techniques,
seeds .... The local cultural exchanges can also be improved wvith the better electricity.
V.    PUBLIC CONSULTATION AND PARTICIPATION
There wvere a number of discussions and consultations with authorities and local EM
people of all 7 EM impacted communes have been conducted during the project preparation
stage. In EM communities, the village elders who used to be the most respectful ones, playing
the vital role in public consultation. They and Nvomen association wvere invited to meetings for
getting information on the project and RP and EMDP. The presentation wvere made by
consultants on proposed locations of the project, its resettlement policy and participants were
requested to express their viewvs toNvard project's possible adverse impacts, propose for
mitigation measures and for development programs.
The local authorities, among them  vere many EM officials, actively engaged in
collecting data on possible impacts on EMs.
Full support of EM, in all affected communles, have been attained for the Dak Nong
RE I subproject. Both local authorities and EM people actively participated in discussions on
their needs, problems and priorities, which may integrate ivith the RE I project to extend and
make use of project's benefits for improving incomes and upgrading their social, economical
and cultural lives. Thus, the communes consulted expressed needs for small credits to develop
farm-based and non-farm activities. Attentioni vas given for consultations wvith EM on their
proposed measures to improve existing agricultural production. Feedbacks from the EM and
their authorities have been incorporated into their development plans Nvhich are described
beloNv.
VI. RECOVERY MEASURES AND DEVELOPMENT PLANS
24



Thlre First Rttral Eei-eg, Project RE I- lhase 3
The EMDP is not only for DPs who are directly affected by land acquisition but also
for the EM wvho is living in the project affected areas. As mentioned in the RP, this EMDP is
developed based on the results of consultation with and participation of EM and their local
authorities.
Special resettlement provisions for ethnic minorities are to ensure consideration of
impacted ethnic people's views on various issues and to represent their legal rights.
Through consultation with and participation of local authorities and EM in the pro'ject
affected areas, thley gave the feedback on the potenltial adverse impacts b) thle project as
belowv:
-    potential of electric shock;
-    accident in the construction period;
-    disturbance by thle construction and construction wvorkers to villages.
All of these feedback are integrated in this EMDP and Environmental Mitigation
Measures.
VI.1. Policy for DPs losing land
I. All of these DPs are entitled to compensation and rehabilitation programs as described
in the RP. In addition, the household wvlo permanently loses productive land is
subsidized wvith an amount of 500,OOOVND for fertilizer in order to rehabilitate the
new land or income.
2. DPs opt land for land will be allocated land in the same village;
3. All DPs affected on land Nvill be granted wvith LURC for their land holdings and for
land they purchase or be compensated at neNv sites without any payment.
4. Severelv affected DPs vill be assisted to access loan from the Banki for Social Policies
(BSP) with the amount of loan from I to 3 million VND per HH in short and medium
terms (1 to 3 years respectively). Proper guidance will be provided so that the people
will knowv how to use and manage credit properly. According to BSP policy, EM wvill
get loans wilit lowver interest rate (from 10% to 15% lower).
Vl.2. Development plans for all Ethnic Minorities in affected areas
A special program is prepared for EM people who are displaced by the project and/or
living in the project areas. It includes the followings:
1. Project Iiifo nmation disseminiatioin:
General Resettlement Information dissemination has been and will continue to be
carried out as a part of the RP implementation for all project's DPs, including the EM
impacted ones. However, to avoid any possible language barrier and ensure full respect to EM.
the project information campaign may need to be done in the concemed local EM languages.
Moreover, it also needs to inform the EM about the EMDP. To implement this activity, the
RIB and other disseminated materials for EM will be translated into and held in the respective
EM language and posted at places adequate to specifics of their cultural and living conditionls.
The project information dissemination for the EM wvill be carried out parallel wvith the
described in the RP schedule for general resettlemllent information campaign. The EM
consultant and EM staff of the PMB, PPMU and PCU \ill cooperate with the concerned
communes to fulfill these tasks. The cost for this special activity is taklen from EVN.
25



71te First Rutral biergy Project RE 1 - Phase 3
2. Trainiiig for electiic safety:
The most population in project area has been connected to local grid line. l-lowever, for
electric safety, certain training of EM still needs to be carried out. For effective organization,
the PMB under PC3 in conjunction wvith PPMU under DN's PPC will cooperate with local
communes to identify specific training needs on electric safety and organize training for all tlhe
local EM HHs. The electric safety education should include followings:
-  Leaflet to introduce the regulation electric safety measures and guidance for giving
first aid in the case of electric shock. The leaflet Nvill be disseminated to all families
in the project areas.
-  Training on electric safety and first aid for electric shock in each commlluLne for
local people and pupil in primary and secondary schools.
Budget for this activity is come from the EVN fund.
3. Assistance to severely affected EM farmers to access small scale, preferential credit.
Such financial support will also contain a training program on applying, use and management
of loan, financing. So far, at this FS stage, there hasn't been identified any severely affected
EM HH who loses more than 10% of thleir total productive land holding. However, in the next,
implementation stage, if certain adjustments in technical design will cause any severe impacts
on some part of the EM, then such assistance will be relevant. The PMB under PC3 and
PPMU under DN's PPC will identify the targeted group for their respective components;
investigate their demand for credit and discuss with the Bank for Social Policies to reach the
Bank's commiitmient on giving priority for thie concerned EMDP's to access its small scale
credits and as well to provide them necessary training on the loan procedures, regulations,
requirements as well as the use and management of the loans. The PMB and PPMU will
consult with BSP on technical aspects to assist thle entitled EM communities in preparing
credit proposal, wlhich includes:
1. Ohbec;ives of'cr-edlit pr-ograin
2. Beneficiairies of the program. The targeted borrowvers are income severely
impacted EM households.
3. Mechanisin for channeling offiinld: The BSP will provide a fund for tlhe
credits through the Bank's existing network, based on the approved
project's proposal for the credit program. The flow of fund wvill go from the
DN's provincial BSP to the District's BSP from vlere the credits may be
directly given to the eligible EM borrowvers or through trusted
organizations. Concrete forms of organizations channeling the fund will be
identified at earl) time of thie project implementation.
4. Repalymncnt: The proposal should provide brief information about main
characteristics and economic status of borrowers, their wvillingness and
ability to repay the loans and proposed saving plans.
5. Terms of credits.: The eligible borroNvers are severely affected EM farmers
w>lho lose more thanu 10% of their total productive land holding and willing
to take a loan. It need to clearly indicate the proposed sizes of loans,
purpose of loans, duration of loans, interest rates, terms of repayment (by
oone time or by installments, how many times, vhen, to wvhom and how
much each installmiient to repay...)
6. Implementation arrangemient: The PMB and PPMU wvill be involved at the
beginning as intermiiediates to connect the BSP Nvith their concemed EM
DPs into the program. After that, to get credit the eligible EM HMs will
directly communicate wvith the Bank's credit system, wvhere loan's
26



7Tle First Rural Dierg Project RE, I - Plhase 3
procedures  will follow  its regulations.  Specific  implementation
responsibilities for management of the fund will be identilied later by the
Bank in consultation with thie EM DPs and local organizations.
7. Cost an1d budget: The total cost of the credit program includes two
components: (i) Cost for preparation, facilitating and monitoring the
program; and, (ii) Credit management cost. The Project Central Counterpart
Budget wvill pay for the first component, while the credit operation and
management cost will strictly followv the Bank's regulations and be included
in the cost of loans.
8. Moniltoring and evaluiationi: The PMB and PPMU will be responsible for
internal-, while the EMA for external monitoring of the program
implementation and assist to resolve any emerged issues.
4. Training on agricultural extension (cultivation and animal husbandr-y):
The income severely affected EM IlHs may specially need technical assistance to
restore their productive capacity. Since they almost base their income on agricultural
activities, first of all, cultivation, a teclnical assistance in form of agricultural extension would
be highly appropriate. Concrete or specific topics and content of agricultural extension
program will be defined during the project implementation stage, based on close consultation
and participation of EM, their representatives and the local authorities. Besides, once the need
for credits and agricultural extension for severely affected DPs wvill be emerged, it wvould be
preferable if the latter could also be provided to other, non-affected, but demanding, EM
audience of the project communes. Special priority xvould also be given to female-headed EM
HHs to include them into this training program. The PMB and PPMU will work closely wvith
commune authorities, relevant local mass organization (Farmers Association, Women's
Union...) to investigate the need, then togetlher with the DARD and AEC of Dak Nong to
prepare a detailed traininig implementation programii for these activities.
VI.3. Mitigation measures
1. Construction  times will be implemented  after harvesting  crops (reasonable
construction scheduling).
2. Regulations of PC3 with its PMB, DN's PPC xvitlh its PPMU, and Construction
companies for traffic safety.
3. Signal/ waming Boards at the dangerous places

a              Appendix 5:               A PROPOSED ACTION PLAN
1. FrameworkIf policy
(Laws and regulations of the government and OD 4.2() of WB to be applied)
2. Mitigation measures
The potential negative impacts
-  Permanent acquisition of land for towver foundation; temporary acquisition of
land in the ROWs and for construction; temiiporary impact on perennial trees
and crops
-  Accidents occur in the process of using appliances suclh as lamps, rice huskers,
oxygen-generating machinies (used in aquaculture). and so on.
-  Hygiene; prices of good may increase in the area due to the increased number
of construction workers.
Mitigation measures:
Information from "Assessment of social impact" and feedback from meetings with the
communities wvill be used by Project Engineers in the design, scheduling, selection of
construction measures for the sub-projects, and in the cost estimation. These include:
a) Recommendation of routing of the powver line, location, construction measures and
scheduling for the sub-projects. in order to respond to the needs and priorities of
the EM communities.
Public consultation has been done in the initial selection of routes, location of
towers, and in the consideration of priorities of the communities in the project
areas.
Construction schedules have been calculated in order to avoid crops. The
construction duration is 12 months, hoowever, allowance has been made to have
two work shifts, so that construction can start right after harvesting and complete
before the following crop.
The temporary crop impact of local people are compensated for according to
market prices.
b) Awareness of ecology, spiritual and cultural issues, and other sensitive issues are
all considered in the design and construction.
The sensitive areas are carefully considered in the initial construction. However,
such sensitive areas are normally some distance from the ROWs.
c) Develop a program of information and education of electricity safety, healtlh and
social issues for EM communities in the project areas.
Special programs for EM commllunlities in the affected areas have been vorked oult as
followvs:
-  Traininlg of agricultural extension for the EM l-lHs i.n the project areas.
-  Training of electricity safety for students and villagers in the project areas.
-  Training of small credits of Bank for agriculture and rural development
d) Acquisition of land and compensation: If land is acquired by the project, it will be
compensated for in a vay that is appropriate and culturally suitable. The
compensation will be carried out according the relocation policy for the people
affected by the project. The leaders of the EM communities wvill help with the
consultation for the affected EHIHs and with the compensation activities.
- The land will be compensated for at an alternative price, as indicated in the
relocation plan. It is noted that all the 555 EM HHs have certificates of right to
the use of land for all the area of land that tlhev have the right to use.
41



771e First Rttral Energy Prqyect RE I - Phase 3
-  There are always representatives of impacted EM persons from each commune
in the EM communities.
-  The administrative structure, the complaint mechanism, and the monitoring
nmechaniism also apply to EM persons. Thle EM persons, as is indicated in the
relocation plan.
3. Support activities
There are regular development programs to aid people living in the project areas. For
example, people living in the affected areas are prioritized for employment in thle
construction period and in the operation and maintenance period. They also have priorities
in applying for medium  and long-term loans from  Bank for agriculture and rural
development. EM communities are also prioritized if there are in the areas projects for
agricultural development sponsored by the WB.
Training: The project will provide training of electricity safety in the affected areas.
This also includes training wvorkslhops for local EM leaders in assessment of social impacts,
relocation, and monitoring of the EMDI'.
Gender assistance: Special consultation and training for Nvomen, particularlv women
wvho are heads of household in areas such as credit. agricultural extension, use of fertilizers.
