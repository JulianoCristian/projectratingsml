However, it is foreseen land\n            acquisition will occur, and some ethnic minorities will be\n            negatively affected within the project area, thus, this\n            Ethnic Minority Development Plan seeks to ensure within the\n            development process, the full respect for minorities'\n            dignity, human rights, and cultural uniqueness, aiming at\n            minimizing adverse effects, and ensuring they receive\n            culturally compatible socioeconomic benefits. It is\n            recommended that power lines be located in accordance to the\n            needs and priorities of ethnic minorities, following public\n            consultations. Construction has been scheduled in order to\n            avoid crop harvesting; notably, with the 12 month\n            construction period, to work shifts have been allowed, so\n            that construction would start right after harvesting, and\n            complete before the following crop. In addition, impacts on\n            temporary crops should be compensated at market prices. The\n            project design, and construction works take into\n            consideration ecological, spiritual, and cultural issues,\n            including avoiding construction around sensitive areas,\n            which are nonetheless, usually at some distance from the\n            right of way (ROW). A program of information and education\n            on electricity safety, health and social issues will be\n            developed to inform ethnic minorities in the project area.\n            Land losses will be compensated, in a suitable, culturally\n            acceptable manner, in accordance with resettlement\n            safeguards. Training assistance will be provided,\n            particularly gender assistance, through special\n            consultations with, and training for women, paying careful\n            attention to women heads of households, in areas such as\n            credit, agricultural extension, use of fertilizers, among others."}, "docdt": "2005-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
