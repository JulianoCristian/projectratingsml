Energy Project of Vietnam had\n            the following ratings: outcomes were satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible, Bank performance\n            was satisfactory, and borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            The lessons learned included: 1) A clear roadmap to achieve\n            the final objective of the Borrower and of the Bank support\n            should be developed and be the basis to design the specific\n            interventions and facilitate their development; 2) The\n            decision to decentralize Rural Electrification to the final\n            implementing agencies proved to be efficient and effective\n            to successfully implement the project and exceed the number\n            of communes and households electrified; 3) Rural\n            electrification projects have a low financial rate of return\n            and should be designed to give the room and stimulate the\n            mobilization of funding from other sources; 4) Consultation\n            and obtaining strong local commitments are essential in\n            projects involving a large numbers of parties; 5) The\n            project had a large numbers of sub-components, to be\n            implemented in difficult areas during a long period of time.\n            Flexibility is essential, both in term of physical scope and\n            approval, to allow for fast adjustment to unexpected\n            conditions (and in this case cost savings) that may arise in\n            implementation and increase the benefit of the project; and\n            6) Projects with local implementing agencies and/or covering\n            several local areas need a TTL and team based in the field\n            to actively and effectively coordinate and inter-act with\n            the client and implementing agencies, and to closely monitor\n            progress addressing fast problems and delays."}, "docdt":
