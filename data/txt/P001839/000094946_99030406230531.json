"The project achieved most of its stated\n            objectives and its overall outcome was rated satisfactory.\n            The key lessons are: 1) Strong Government support and\n            participation in the design and implementation of the public\n            enterprise (PE) reform and privatization program was a sine\n            qua non condition to the success of these reforms. 2)\n            Parastatal Sector Reform Agency (CRSP) played a critical\n            role in the design and implementation of reforms, including\n            privatization and divestiture, and provided the necessary\n            leadership to ensure ownership of the process. 3)\n            Performance agreements (PAs) help clarify goals, increase\n            autonomy, and open the dialogue between management and\n            government - but their benefits have been oversold. In\n            retrospect, the Bank should have put utility sector policy\n            and regulatory reforms, privatization and private\n            participation as key elements of the PE reform program,\n            rather than restructuring under PAs."}, "docdt": "1998-11-05T00:00:00Z"}
