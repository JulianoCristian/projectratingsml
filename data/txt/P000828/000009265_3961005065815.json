Works and Capacity Building\n            Project's objectives are to: (a) build local capacity;\n            (b) assist the government in maintaining infrastructure\n            assets; and (c) participate in reducing the current\n            unemployment issue by creating temporary jobs in the public\n            works and the construction sector. The project has three\n            main components. The first component is an investment\n            component aimed at protecting the existing infrastructure\n            from decay and developing additional urgently needed social\n            infrastructure. The program of labor intensive subprojects\n            includes two types of operations: (a) public works including\n            routine maintenance of roads, rehabilitation of drainage\n            system; and urban infrastructure; and (b) public services,\n            notably cleaning up spoiled urban areas as well as testing\n            private management practices of waste collection. The second\n            component is capacity building through training and\n            technical support for the beneficiaries and small- and\n            medium-sized enterprises aimed at: (a) enhancing the\n            technical capacity of domestic construction contractors and\n            local consultants; (b) improving the management of public\n            infrastructure by local governments, and emphasizing\n            maintenance of new construction; and (c) improving public\n            procurements and contract management practices. The third\n            component is a study component aimed at defining more\n            broadly-based improvements in the urban infrastructure\n            maintenance management; and the private sector participation\n            as a support of the project in general and the preparation\n            of the urban environment project."}, "docdt": "1993-11-10T00:00:00Z"}
