quality of education, health, water\n            and sanitation services, and improves rural services,\n            discusses potential, negative environmental impacts and\n            measures proposed to mitigate them. They include the\n            following: restrict the use of ecologically sensitive areas,\n            forest, wetlands, etc., to prevent natural resource\n            degradation. Improve soil and water conservation, and\n            judiciously apply agricultural inputs. Ensure that\n            pesticides are used in accordance with integrated pest\n            management principles to offset using increasing quantities\n            of agrochemicals in agricultural activities. Observe the\n            maximum residue level for commercial crops, and train small\n            farmers in storing, handling, and applying agrochemicals, as\n            well as crop management. To reduce waste and effluent from\n            agro-processing, employ a waste management and environmental\n            audit for selected agro-processing facilities. Environmental\n            guidelines for road construction and maintenance works will\n            be developed and adopted. Improve institutional capacity for\n            transportation and environmental management, and train staff\n            and contractors. The health care waste strategy (HCW) raises\n            awareness; segregates special waste from other waste;\n            determines appropriate treatment technology; considers\n            facility-based versus disposal options; reduces waste\n            generation; monitors infection control and environmental\n            protection; uses appropriate technology for packaging,\n            transport, treatment, and disposal; develops a HCW\n            management plan for facilities; trains health care workers\n            in HCW management procedures; and addresses scavenging\n            issues. Mitigations applied to water supply and sanitation\n            (WSS) will include conducting random/selective environmental\n            audits for WSS facilities, and provides awareness training\n            for WSS professionals."}, "docdt": "2004-03-11T11:25:01Z"}
