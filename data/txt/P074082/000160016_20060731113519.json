"The Uganda Fourth Poverty Reduction\n            Support Operation Project has a satisfactory outcome, is\n            likely to be sustainable, and has a substantial\n            institutional development impact. The performances of both\n            the Bank and the Borrower are satisfactory. Among the\n            lessons cited were the following: 1) In Uganda, the project\n            was able to ensure specific reforms in local government\n            procurement and these were included in the Cabinet paper and\n            subsequently enshrined in law. Specific actions guiding\n            reforms in anti-corruption, financial management, management\n            of public finances and budget process were all realized. 2)\n            Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) are most effective\n            when sequenced over a period of time, at least three years,\n            and where each PRSC builds on actions taken in previous\n            years. Expecting major reforms over a one-year period is\n            unrealistic. However, designing actions each year which lead\n            to outputs over a three year period is possible. 3)\n            Definition of measurable outputs which lead to improved\n            infant and maternal mortality is important. It is also\n            important that the design of these interim outputs and their\n            measurement is carried out in partnership with Government.\n            4) PRSCs may be the only external operational modality which\n            can get interaction between different Government ministries\n            on reforms: this strength of the PRSC instrument needs to be\n            used sparingly. 5) Coordination of PRSCs should be carried\n            out at the highest technical level of Government. When the\n            Office of the Prime Minister took over coordination, other\n            ministries were willing to recognize their right to\n            coordinate as this is the arrangement agreed within\n            Government. This ensured that very senior officials, often\n            Permanent Secretaries attended the various PRSC meetings and\n            ensured that the actions for which their ministry was\n            responsible were taken. 6) Lastly, it is critical that other\n            development partners are involved in the preparation of the PRSC."}, "docdt": "2006-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
