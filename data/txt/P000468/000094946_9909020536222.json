Contrary to the benefits expected at\n            appraisal time, institutional benefits were limited, while\n            socio-economic benefits were not properly evaluated, and\n            remain seemingly limited. Furthermore, although monitoring\n            and evaluation does indicate some increase in crops'\n            productivity, the establishment of agricultural production\n            benefits was not clearly defined, and, such increase may not\n            be attributed to the adoption of improved technology\n            methods. Likewise, the project did not provide indicators to\n            measure the impact from environmental benefits. The major\n            lessons suggest, that while this project raises questions\n            regarding supervision accessibility in a country suffering\n            civil unrest, still, project design should address more\n            precise monitoring and evaluation indicators. Special\n            attention should be given, when considering centralized\n            technical ministries for execution of crucial agricultural\n            research and extension projects, as efficiency may be poor,\n            whereas, decentralized, autonomous agencies may prove more\n            efficient. In addition, project design may need to phase the\n            project progressively, i.e., 1) institutional set-up; 2)\n            capacity building; 3) research and extension operations,\n            and, procurement work. The responsibility for operational\n            costs should be clearly stated, particularly, when\n            suspension occurs, to avoid exceptional expenses."}, "docdt": "1999-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
