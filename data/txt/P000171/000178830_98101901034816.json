The\n            project's components were aimed at bringing about\n            increases in coffee and food crop production and comprised\n            agricultural services elements, an experimental rural\n            development program, a program of management capacity\n            building, coffee research and coffee processing activities,\n            and rural infrastructure rehabilitation works. Overall, the\n            project was a qualified success. Start-up was delayed by\n            frequent changes in management and implementation and was\n            adversely affected by management difficulties throughout.\n            Project achievements for food crop and livestock development\n            fell well below targets set at the time of appraisal; in\n            retrospect, these appear to have been too optimistic. The\n            experimental rural development and economic and social\n            infrastructure components were not implemented. In contrast,\n            the results of the coffee development components were good\n            and exceeded appraisal estimates both as to quantity and\n            quality of incremental production. It can be stated with\n            confidence that the coffee-washing stations constructed\n            under the Second Ngozi Project are economically viable. This\n            has been the principal achievement of the project."}, "docdt": "1983-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
