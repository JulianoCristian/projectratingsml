   governments can make a crucial contribution to sustaining\n            rural development: providing local public infrastructure and\n            the delivery of municipal services; protecting the\n            environment and the sustainable management of natural\n            resources; and promoting local economic development. There\n            are two project components: municipal development and\n            municipal environmental management. The first component\n            includes four sub-components, which are decentralized\n            financing, strengthening municipal institutions,\n            strengthening the Nicaraguan Institute for Municipal\n            Development (INIFOM), and evaluating and developing policy.\n            The second component includes three sub-component, which are\n            decentralization of environmental management, environmental\n            information systems, and environmental municipal facility."}, "docdt": "2001-02-21T00:00:00Z"}
