This summary of\n            environmental analysis, and mitigation plan includes a\n            checklist to classify subprojects into two categories,\n            namely category I, where no impact is identified, to be\n            reviewed by the Technical Environmental Unit, and, category\n            II where minor environmental problems are identified, thus\n            requiring a limited environmental review, to be conducted by\n            the Technical Environmental Unit, and the Ministry of\n            Natural Resources and the Environment (MARENA). However,\n            those subprojects that fall under category III, i.e., with\n            irreversible environmental impacts, will not be financed\n            under FAM. The summary identifies the steps to be taken in\n            selecting subprojects: targeting, and promotion to ensure\n            environmental issues are introduced in project\n            implementation; project formulation to ensure environmental\n            issues are introduced to project implementation; appraisal,\n            to ensure environmental screening, and mitigation has been\n            addressed, particularly that contract clauses have been\n            enforced; and, monitoring, and evaluation to assess\n            environmental screening, and mitigation procedures. Detailed\n            mitigation plans are described in the Operational Manual."}, "docdt": "2001-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
