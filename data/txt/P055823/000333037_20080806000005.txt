in three major areas in which they can make a critical contribution to sustainable rural
development: (i) provision of local public infrastructure and the delivery of municipal
services; (ii) the protection of the environment and the sustainable management of natural
resources, and (iii) the promotion of local economic development.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      In the 1990's, following two decades of conflict, the Nicaraguan government undertook a
transition from a centrally planned to a more open, market economy with greater private sector
participation.    Benefiting by a decade of peace within the country and of strong
worldwide/global economic growth, by 2000, Nicaragua experienced 6 years of steady economic
growth and a decline of inflation to single digit levels. Private domestic and foreign investment
began a recovery, and open unemployment fell significantly. However, while these economic
advances were being made, poverty levels remained high for the 46% of the population living in
rural areas. In 1996, of Nicaragua's rural population of 1.9 million, 76% lived in poverty, and
36% lived in extreme poverty. In the same year poverty rates were much lower for the 2.1
million living in urban areas, where there was an overall poverty rate of 32% and extreme
poverty rate of 7%.

2.      The first Nicaragua Rural Municipalities project was approved in late 1996 to address the
problem of rural poverty in 32 pilot rural municipalities while strengthening community
organizations and municipal governments. By the time of appraisal of the second, follow-on
project in October 2000, progress had been made in rural areas so that: (i) participatory planning
processes had been successfully introduced and a multi-year and annual municipal development
plans were being produced in the 32 pilot rural municipalities; (ii) the potential for municipal
investment had been demonstrated through the success of the subproject investments, including
the Hurricane Mitch relief subprojects, financed by the first project; and (iii) the State
Modernization Law of 1998 had been passed, indicating a broad area of responsibilities for
municipal governments. However, there was still a significant gap in resources and capacity for
rural municipalities to be able to carry out basic municipal services and support economic
investments by their communities. Although other mechanisms, notably the Social Emergency
Investment Fund (FISE) supported investment in the social sectors, the problem of persistent
rural poverty required a strengthening of the capacity of the municipal administrations and the
reinforcing of fiscal capacity of these municipalities so that economic investments could be
sustainably made. In addition, the problems of natural resource management, exacerbated by the
floods and devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch in 1998, required local solutions for which
there was not yet any successful model.

3.      Given this context, the Second Rural Municipal Development Project (SRMDP) was
designed as a response to the need for stronger local administrations to address the provision of
basic local public works and services to foster rural development, environmental management of
natural resources, and a sustainable local fiscal system were considered the key elements of the
project.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

4.      The project development objective is to improve the performance of rural municipalities,
by building their capacity in three major areas in which municipal governments can make a
critical contribution to sustainable rural development and environmental management: (a) the


                                                 1

provision of local public infrastructure and the delivery of municipal services; (b) the protection
of the environment and the sustainable management of natural resources, and (c) the promotion
of local economic development.

5.     At appraisal there were six PDO indicators identified (see the Logical Framework):

    a. Improved local governance indicators in 43 municipalities:
       (i)     increase community involvement and participation in local decision-making (32
               municipalities of PROTIERRA 1 from 68% to 80%, 11 new municipalities from
               30% to 60%);
       (ii)    perception of transparency of municipal officers by the general public increased
               (from 50% to 70%); and,
       (iii)   increasing tax revenue of target municipalities of target municipalities from the
               current $9.5 million to $12.5 million.
    b. Actual vs. planned improvement in coverage, quality and cost effectiveness of:
       (i)     municipal services;
       (ii)    municipal infrastructure;
       (iii)   local natural resources management; and
       (iv)    local economic development. Evaluation of municipal performance would be
               based on the completion of individual Municipal Development Plans.
    c. Implementation of at least 15% per year of the 5 year Municipal Development Plan
       including environmental aspects.
    d. The difference between urban/rural investments ratio and population ratio is inferior to
       20% in 90% of the municipalities.
    e. Improved institutional performance of the Nicaraguan Institute for Municipal
       Development (INIFOM) in terms of:
       (i)     perception of the beneficiaries, as revealed by regular surveys of municipal staff
               and other municipal actors;
       (ii)    increased number of INIFOM staff deconcentrated to departmental offices (from
               current 40% to 45%);
       (iii)   ratio of technical and professional staff to administrative and directive staff (from
               15% to 25%);
       (iv)    subjectively, on the basis of technical contribution to the national policy debate on
               municipal development; and,
       (v)     allocation and productive efficiency of local government and central government
               compared and measured in relative terms.
    f. Improved municipal natural resource and urban environmental management:
       (i)     municipal land use plans approved in at least 60% of target municipalities;
       (ii)    at least 10 municipalities contribute to the management of protected areas in their
               territory;
       (iii)   90% of Municipal Environmental Commission (CAM) established and 60%
               active with participation of public and private municipal entities;
       (iv)    EIA performed and consulted for 100% of investment projects; and,
       (v)     60% agricultural and industrial producer are aware of their responsibilities and
               environmental duties.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification


                                                 2

6.      The SRMDP development objective was not modified during project implementation.
Throughout project implementation the DO remained relevant to the country's overarching
policy of decentralization as reflected in the different shared Donors and government documents
such as the PRSP, CAS, the Interim CAS and other relevant documents.

7.       A new project component C (Support to the decentralization reform process) was added
through an amendment to the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) in December 2004 to
respond to an opportunity to enhance municipal performance by supporting the implementation
of the 2003 Municipal Transfers Law covering all 153 municipalities. That law, based on the
successful pilot of a fiscal transfer model (FONDEM) by SRMDP for its 43 municipalities,
mandated a regular fiscal transfer to all municipalities beginning in 2004. It created a new role
for the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MHCP) to review municipal financial
performance and planning, and approve the annual transfers. The DCA amendment responded to
the new context presented by the law, and supported actions to ensure the transfer program was
effectively implemented, including the reviews and evaluations of municipal performance by
MHCP. In addition to strengthening MHCP, it financed the Comptroller General of the Republic
(CGR) to carry out audits of municipal accounts and provide related technical assistance (TA) to
evaluate and improve financial management capacity of the municipalities. The Office of Public
Administration (OAP) in the Technical Secretariat of the Presidency (SETEC) was added to the
project by amendment in October 2006 to support the role OAP was given to prepare a
decentralization policy and strategy. To reflect the expected outcomes of Component C, six new
Intermediate Outcome Indicators were added, including:
    i. Processing time for fiscal transfer requests decreased from 28 days to 10 days.
    ii. Fiscal neutrality in national budget for municipal transfers from 33% to 100%.
    iii. Government officials trained in fiscal decentralization, municipal finance, best practices
         in decentralization, and the new roles of MHCP in public sector management (20 key
         MHCP staff trained).
    iv. Municipal Transfer Information System (TRANSMUNI) operating and processing
         information on transfers and municipals expenditures in all 153 municipalities.
    v. Municipal audits conducted by CGR or contracted to external audits firms (184 audits
         conducted).
    vi. Development, publication, and dissemination of a policy, strategy, and program for
         National Decentralization and Local Development

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

8.      The principal intended beneficiaries of the project were rural communities located in the
countryside, small rural towns, and rural municipal governments. The participating
municipalities for the original Component A (Rural Municipal Development) were limited to 43
municipalities which later expanded to include 152 municipalities (all except Managua) starting
in 2005. The beneficiaries for Component B (Municipal Environmental Management) were 70
rural municipalities and their communities.

9.       Secondary beneficiaries expected to gain from project activities were the central level
institutions that were targeted for institutional strengthening, especially INIFOM and MARENA.
With the addition of Component C in 2004 and expansion of that component in 2006,


                                                   3

institutional strengthening efforts were added in support of MHCP, CGR, and OAP. The
Association of Municipalities (AMUNIC) also indirectly benefited from project activities.

1.5 Original Components

10.     The project's original design included two components.              Component A, Rural
Municipal Development (est. US$28.95 million, 71% of total cost) financed: (i) the Municipal
Development Fund (Fondo de Desarrollo Municipal ­ FONDEM) which provided resources to
participating municipalities for subproject investments for local public infrastructure,
improvement of municipal services, the promotion of local economic development, and
municipal institutional strengthening; (ii) the strengthening of municipal institutions; (iii) the
strengthening of INIFOM; and (iv) evaluation and policy development.               The overarching
purpose of Component A was to support the government's effort to strengthen municipal
governments and to pilot a fiscal transfer mechanism that allowed municipalities to make needed
investments.

11.     Component B, Municipal Environmental Management (est. US$ 11.74 million, 29%
of total cost) financed: (i) support to decentralization of environmental management; (ii) an
environmental information system (SINIA); and (iii) the Municipal Environmental Facility
(FAM).     The overarching purpose of Component B was to strengthen the environmental
management capacity of municipalities and establish a mechanism that would provide resources
for environmental subproject investments.

1.6 Revised Components

12.     As described above in para. 7, in December 2004, the Government of Nicaragua (GoN)
requested an amendment to the DCA to add Component C, Support to the decentralization
reform process. Component C contained four subcomponents: (i) to strengthen MHCP in its
new role of managing fiscal transfers to municipalities; (ii) to strengthen CGR in its new role to
conduct municipal audits and strengthen municipal internal financial controls; (iii) to strengthen
the President's Office of Public Administration (OAP), who had the mandate for preparing and
overseeing the decentralization policy and strategy work; and (iv) to finance fuel needed to field
emergency recovery flights to areas affected by Hurricane Felix. The first two subcomponents
were added with the first DCA amendment in December 2004, the third by an amendment in
October 2006, and the fourth by an amendment in October 2007.

13.     After the successful piloting through FONDEM, the central government, with the new
Municipal Transfers Law (August 2003), began financing formula-based transfers to all
municipalities, including those 43 municipalities included in the project. The project credit was
therefore no longer needed to finance municipal investment subprojects through FONDEM. It
was important to add Component C to respond to the challenge of implementing this new
program. To succeed in building both municipal capacity and performance: (i) MHCP needed
to quickly develop its capacity to manage the complex requirements of the new municipal
transfer system; (ii) CGR needed to carry out a program of municipal audits and related
municipal capacity building to provide for greater accountability in the municipalities' use of the
transferred funds; and (iii) OAP needed to work with INIFOM to better define the
decentralization of responsibilities to municipalities to ensure that this decentralization kept pace


                                                 4

with the transfer of resources to them. In addition, the design of Component C responded to two
of the recommendations made in the November 2004 joint World Bank and IMF Policy Note
(Municipal Decentralization in Nicaragua: Fiscal and Institutional Issues): (i) to strengthen the
capacity of central institutions involved in implementing the new law; and (ii) to have annual
audits conducted of municipalities to assess their use of these new resources.          The Bank
demonstrated significant flexibility and proactively in responded to the changes and new context
that the 2003 Municipal Transfer law created.

1.7 Other significant changes

14.     The most significant changes in the project were:
    a. Project design, scope and implementation arrangements.                With the first DCA
        amendment described above, the project design was revised to no longer finance a pilot
        transfer mechanism (which was a successful pilot and was mainstreamed for all
        municipalities with the Municipal Transfers Law and thus became obsolete) but to
        support the development of systems needed to implement the government-financed
        transfer mechanism which replaced FONDEM and to expand the program of technical
        assistance and training for all municipalities which were now receiving the transfer.
        Three new project implementing agencies were added, MHCP as the manager of the
        transfer system, the CGR as responsible for contracting and conducting municipal audits
        and OAP as responsible for the development of the decentralization policy and strategy
        which would guide actions related to transfers to municipalities and efforts to strengthen
        municipal capacity. The municipal environment component (Component B) was not
        revised, although with the success of the Environment Information System, SINIA,
        additional resources were allocated within the project to support this work.
    b. Project schedule. The project as originally designed was to close by December 2004, 3
        years and 9 months after board approval in March 2001. During the project restructuring
        discussions, a decision was taken to add new project activities and to extend the length of
        the project to June 2006. This closing date was later extended to December 2007,
        making the total project length 6 ¾ years. These extensions were done to allow the
        project to build on its early success of getting the piloted transfer mechanism legally
        established and to take complementary actions to support the effective implementation of
        the new mechanism.
    c. Funding re-allocations.       Savings in the project credit from the early closing of
        FONDEM and from a reduction in the allocation to FAM were redistributed to provide an
        increased allocation for operational expenditures for INIFOM to allow for the expansion
        of its services to 152 from the original 43 project municipalities, increased consulting
        services for the establishment of SINIA, and financing for the activities within


                                                 5

        Component C. In addition, the disbursement rate for operating expenses of INIFOM and
        MARENA was modified to maintain it at 80% through the life of the project, instead of
        decreasing to 60% and 40% as per the original design. This was done to address the
        problem of availability of counterpart funds for these two institutions.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their mitigations
identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

15.     The project was designed as a follow-on operation of the Rural Municipality Project
(PROTIERRA -- see ICR for the project: Report #25373), which was implemented between
March 1997 and March 2002. The project design effectively incorporated a number of lessons
learned:
     a. The success of the first project in assisting poor, rural municipalities to develop
        institutional capacity in four areas (participatory planning, financial management, project
        management and procurement, and property tax systems) was recognized and a
        continuation of work in these areas was built into municipal institutional strengthening
        subcomponent implemented by INIFOM.
     b. The poor performance of a municipal revolving fund for community productive projects
        in the first project and in similar rural development projects in other countries, led to
        omitting this element from the second project.
     c. The success of municipal investments in the first project in public infrastructure and
        services led to continuing to support these investments through a newly created fund
        (FONDEM) in the second project. This new mechanism was defined as a pilot of a
        formula-driven fiscal transfer from which policy-makers could learn.                It functioned
        effectively in that way, and lessons from the implementation of FONDEM were built into
        the Municipal Transfers Law of 2003.
     d. Concern that transfers to municipalities would negatively affect local tax effort was
        addressed by the incorporation into the FONDEM allocation formula (and later the fiscal
        transfer formula) an incentive for improving local property tax collection.
     e. The limited investment made by project municipalities in environmental subprojects in
        the first project led to the creation of a separate fund for such projects (FAM) to provide
        an incentive for municipalities to undertake environmental investments.
     f. SINIA, the Environmental Information System, was designed to function in a series of
        regional nodes rather than being concentrated in one national office. Each regional office,
        working with regionally-based NGOs, took responsibility for the quality and use of the
        system for its region. This was an innovative, and ultimately effective, approach to
        designing environmental information systems.

16.     The risks to achievement of the DO and the achievement of project outputs were
appropriately identified. Of the six risks identified, one turned out to be difficult to surmount,
i.e., the "effective management and leadership of INIFOM." The PAD described the difficulty
and risks associated with attempting to strengthen INIFOM's capacity. However, what was not
foreseen was that during the project INIFOM would experience significant instability and
conflict within its leadership, with 7 Executive Presidents and 7 General Managers appointed in


                                                    6

6 years, and with differing visions and loyalties represented by these leaders, related to the fact
that one was appointed by the President of the Republic and the other by the INIFOM board.
These changes presented obstacles for continuity in support of INIFOM capacity building and
commitment to key organization changes attempted since the beginning of the project. The
mitigation measures identified were: (i) technical assistance and capacity building for INIFOM;
and (ii) limiting the project area to 43 municipalities. The success of FONDEM and the
municipal development activities can indeed be related to the initial limitation of the project area
to 43 municipalities in the first three years, including 32 that had already become experienced
with subprojects and had initiated capacity development activities under the first project. The
intensive provision of "technical assistance and capacity building" to strengthen INIFOM itself
had the benefit of ensuring that key municipal development activities were conducted during the
project in spite of INIFOM's capacity building challenges.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions taken,
as applicable)

17.     Overall, project implementation went well in most areas. The municipal fund, FONDEM,
had a rapid start-up in all 43 municipalities and as designed provided financing for municipal
investment plans from the end of 2001 through 2003, when it was replaced in 2004 by the fiscal
transfer system. With the project providing financing for INIFOM consultants and staff, and
with bilateral aid agencies providing additional TA input, implementation of institutional
development assistance to municipalities began slowly, but moved ahead rapidly from 2004
through 2006, providing assistance to 152 municipalities (in contrast to the 43 of the original
design). The institutional development of INIFOM, however, did not proceed on schedule. The
organizational restructuring was designed but not implemented, and debilities in the institutional
structure remained throughout the project.

18.     Project implementation for Component B, Municipal Environmental Management, began
in earnest in 2003, after the appointment of a new Minister for MARENA, an internal re-
organization, and a decision to create a small project coordinating unit that would develop the
capacity to oversee the implementation of the component. Implementation of all three areas of
Component B moved ahead smoothly. With the first project amendment in 2004, resources were
re-allocated to finance additional consultant services for SINIA, which was developing at a rapid
pace.

19.     After the project mid-term review (MTR) in June 2003, the ratings for the achievement of
the project development objective (PDO) and implementation progress (IP) were both
downgraded to Unsatisfactory. The primary reasons for this were the delays in nearly all areas
of implementation with the exception of FONDEM. These delays were acutely felt as the project
as designed was to close in December 2004. In addition, an Unsatisfactory rating was also given
for financial management, financial performance, project management, compliance with agreed
procurement schedules, and quality and reliability of procurement administration. Problems in
procurement compliance and financial management had been identified in both INIFOM and
MARENA.




                                                   7

20.     Almost immediately following the MTR, the national congress, with unexpected speed,
approved legislation to provide fiscal transfers to municipalities modeled after FONDEM. This
action created a new avenue for strengthening municipal planning, financial management and tax
collection systems, through the implementation of the transfer program. Taking advantage of
this situation, Bank staff and government organized two project restructuring missions, one in
late 2003 and one in 2004, which led to the design of Component C.

21.     The DCA amendment that added a new project component was signed in December 2004.
In the context of the changes in the number of components the implementation during the final
three years of the project (2005-2007) saw the following:

    a. INIFOM managed TA and training programs directed to the 152 municipalities with the
        focus being to help them meet the planning and management requirements established by
        law to access the fiscal transfers; these programs were also supported by projects
        financed by bilateral aid agencies;
    b. The Municipal Environmental Management component was implemented, as designed,
        under the leadership of MARENA with collaboration of nongovernmental and local
        authorities; and
    c. The three new project implementing agencies, MHCP, CGR and OAP, conducted their
        planned programs in support of the policy and operational issues related to the transfer
        system.

22.     In 2007, the final year of the project, there was a cutback in planned activities by all of
the project supported institutions. In early 2007 it was discovered that INIFOM had overspent its
allocation from the project credit by approximately US$1 million. Planned activities that were
cut completely or partially included: project evaluation studies by INIFOM; contracting of
additional audit reports for municipalities by CGR, conduct of studies of the fiscal transfer
system by MHCP; and activities agreed upon with OAP for supporting the finalization of the
decentralization strategy, program and implementation plan.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

23.     The evaluation design and institutional arrangements had two principal challenges. First,
the design was overly complicated and onerous. It required a baseline, mid-term and completion
study, regular surveys of municipal officials and other municipal actors, and analyses of
municipal tax collection and the distribution of municipal investments. Second, data collection
and analysis for the evaluation was assigned to INIFOM staff, whose capacity in this area was
limited. Additionally, when the Sectoral Commission for Decentralization, which had overall
responsibility for evaluation of the INIFOM component, was dissolved and its functions
transferred to OAP in December 2004, the evaluation function was not transferred to OAP and
not assumed by INIFOM either.

24.     During implementation the baseline study and one of the municipal surveys were done as
was the annual analysis of municipal tax collection. Neither the follow-up to the baseline study
nor the additional municipal surveys were completed, making the assessment of a very limited
number of indicators that relied on perception measurement difficult. The annual analysis of the
municipal tax collection efforts was used as input to the FONDEM and fiscal transfer funding


                                                 8

formulas and as a measure of the overall success of FONDEM and the transfer system. Finally,
as defined in the 2004 project amendment, a study was contracted to evaluate the fiscal transfer
system on behalf of the Municipal Transfers Commission. The study was completed and
provided recommendations to the Commission regarding the modification of the system.

25.     With regard to the monitoring of project implementation, most of the monitoring tasks
worked well. Monitoring was aided by the requirement of the Municipal Transfers law that
MHCP certify the existence of multi-annual and annual investment plans of each municipality,
the existence of financial records and closing documentation for the previous fiscal year, and
improvement in each municipality's property tax collection. Information collected from the
municipalities was maintained and was made accessible through a web-based system, called
TRANSMUNI, which created greater transparency of municipal governance and provided useful
input to policy makers. Internally, INIFOM's monitoring of its own project financial and
account information was weak, and led to the overspending by INIFOM of approximately US$1
million of the project budget assigned to them.

26.     The    Municipal      Environmental      Management    Component     included   a  specific
subcomponent to develop a comprehensive environmental information system (called SINIA) to
monitor progress in environmental quality at the federal and municipal levels.                This
subcomponent provided hardware, software, training and staff time to build this system. The
system was highly successful as it provided for the entry and processing of up-to-date
information on 53 indicators, and was accessible and utilized by municipal and federal
government officials as well as universities, NGOs and others.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

Fiduciary Issues

27.     Starting in early 2002, challenges in establishing and maintaining sound financial
management and procurement operations in INIFOM and MARENA were identified by
specialized Bank staff. These challenges persisted through the mid-term review in June 2003
and then improved marginally for INIFOM and improved substantially for MARENA.

28.     In early 2002, a procurement post-review was conducted which concluded that INIFOM
and MARENA lacked procurement capacity.                 A supervision mission later that same year
identified challenges in INIFOM regarding the contracting of consultants and inconsistencies
between the approved procurement plans and actual procurement. By the middle of 2003, as part
of the MTR, financial management, financial performance and project management were rated
unsatisfactory. MARENA's procurement staff was judged to be more skilled but still lacking the
necessary capacity to carry out sound procurement according to the Bank's procedures. By 2004,
when a decision was being taken to extend the project by 18 months, MARENA had
significantly improved its capacity and INIFOM had improved but continued to require close
supervision and assistance from Bank staff located in the Managua office. The rating was
upgraded in May 2004 to Satisfactory noting that INIFOM's procurement capacity had improved
and that MARENA's capacity was considered adequate.                  Because of these challenges,
throughout project implementation specialized Bank staff in financial management and


                                                     9

procurement conducted regular supervision in order to follow-up on fiduciary issues, and
procurement post reviews were carried out every six months. In spite of these efforts, in
February 2007 it was discovered that INFOM had overspent its project budget allocation by
$1,012,610 due to undocumented and unreported expenditures since the beginning of the project
covered by INIFOM's Special Account. These expenditures have since been documented as
eligible expenditures and recorded by the Bank. This had an impact on the project as many
planned activities in all components but MARENA had to be cancelled or financed by other
sources.    Procurement and financial management by MHCP and CGR were considered
satisfactory during the project with only minor issues.

Social and Environmental Safeguards

29.     The sub-projects financed by FONDEM followed the environmental safeguard rules
spelled out in the Operational Manual. These sub-projects were small with an upper limit of
US$ 50,000.      Subprojects primarily included urban infrastructure, parks, housing, water,
sanitation, street repairs, markets, equipment, and capacity building. The Operational Manual
restricted the financing of any new roads in fragile ecosystems. Sub-projects involving water
and sanitation or toxic management had to be assessed by the National Sanitation Company
(Empresa Nacional de Alcantarillados ­ ENACA), the Ministry of Health and MARENA.

30.     The original project area, covering three departments of Nicaragua, did not have a large
indigenous population and there was no Indigenous Development Plan completed for the project.
The Operational Manuals for both FONDEM of INIFOM and FAM of MARENA contained
guidelines, however, to ensure the participation of indigenous group representatives in those
subprojects. In practice, however, it was through the FAM that project implementers expected
that indigenous groups, such as the Sutiava of Leon (see p. 21 of the PAD) would gain access to
resources for productive community investments.          During implementation, MARENA did
provide technical assistance to the Sutiava indigenous group to design a participatory planning
exercise. According to the staff in MARENA, there was a dispute within the communities of the
Sutiava and the planning exercise did not take place. Other financing was made available to the
Sutiava from the Millennium account and was used to support mangrove reforestation and black
shell cultivation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation

31.     A significant portion of the project activities have become institutionalized through the
passage of the Municipal Transfers Law in 2003 so that the completion of the project has had no
practical negative affect on their continuation. This includes: (i) the policy to transparently
provide resources to municipalities for investment projects they identify and implement through
the fiscal transfer system: (ii) TRANSMUNI which provides information on all municipalities
and provides an easy, web-based system for municipalities to demonstrate they have met the
requirements of the fiscal transfer law; (iii) the guidelines and requirements for citizen
participation and fiscal accountability which have been built in as legally based conditions for
receiving fiscal transfers; and (iv) the incentive provided by the distribution formula for
municipalities to increase property tax collection which in turn enhances their ability to maintain
and operate the infrastructure and services they are developing. In addition, at the local level,
citizens have now had years of experience in participatory planning and playing an active role in


                                                10

their local government. All indications are that this capacity will continue to grow, especially
given the support for their role in the legal framework.

32.      Continuation of municipal development services seems likely given: (i) there exists
ongoing programs by INIFOM as it continues to receive support from bilateral and multilateral
sources; and (ii) a strengthened AMUNIC has active municipal development programs,
substantial staff capacity and resources from bilaterally financed projects.                     With regard to
municipal environmental activities, there are no post-completion plans for continuing the support
for such subprojects. There have been discussions in government, however, regarding the
provision of matching funds to municipalities for certain areas of national priority, including
investment in environmental subprojects. It is also quite possible that municipalities will decide
on their own to dedicate part of their transfer funds to environmental subprojects, as the value of
these projects has been demonstrated to be highly relevant in many municipalities.

33.      At the end of the project implementation period, The Environmental Information System
(SINIA) was given recognition by MARENA and its status was elevated by having the SINIA
unit report directly to the Vice Minister. One of the unexpected outcomes of the project has been
the very strong demand for information by NGOs, other government institutions, schools,
universities, media and municipalities from SINIA. The local nodes visited during the ICR
mission continue to operate and serve as training centers for local technical schools and
universities as well as for the municipalities.              However, there was concern expressed by
MARENA staff that requirements for additional hardware and the expense in continuing to
collect some of the information might not be met without the support of additional external
financing.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

34.      Among the four strategic objective of the Bank's 2007 Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) for Nicaragua (FY08-12 -- Report No. 39637-NI ) is "strengthening governance and
accountability by modernizing state institutions and promoting citizen participation."                           By
improving municipal capacity (both in terms of enhancing citizen participation and streamlining
transparent budget and financial management) the SRMDP supported the governance agenda. In
the consultation process for the CPS, input received emphasized the importance to strengthening
citizen participation, providing opportunities for "social auditing," and ensuring that there was a
clearer articulation of decentralization policy in terms of the relative roles of local and national
levels (see CPS, p.31). The project directly addressed these issues. Not only the project was
relevant to the current CPS but was aligned with the two PRSPs (for 2001-2005 and 2005-2009)
that included decentralization as main target of government strategy.1



1See the PRSP for 2001-2005 ( Report # 22627) that prioritized three cross-cutting themes: ecological vulnerability;
social inequality; and decentralization. The PRSP for 2005-2009 identified governance and state reforms that
included plan to implement a national decentralization strategy to enhance the provision of public services while
maintaining fiscal stability.




                                                        11

35.     The SRMDP was also an important mechanism through which the government's
municipal development policy and decentralization policy was advanced. Four major pieces of
legislation were passed during project implementation that explicitly supported strategies
advocated by the project. These were: the Municipal Transfer Law; the Municipal Financial
Administration, Participatory Budgeting, and Solvency Law; the Municipal Civil Servants
Career Law; and the Municipal Cadastre Law. One objective of government was to achieve
"horizontal equality" in the capacity of all municipalities to finance basic services and make
priority investments. This objective was a central element and achievement of the project.

36.     One policy area the project addressed directly during implementation was the need for a
stronger link between the transfer of resources to municipal government and the transfer of
responsibility. According to Nicaragua Public Expenditure Review (2007) debt sustainability
may be vulnerable to the growth in current transfers, specifically the increased fiscal transfers to
the municipalities as mandated by the Municipal Transfer law. That review recommended that
Nicaragua should develop a political consensus on a decentralization strategy that would result in
a more explicit linkage between central government transfers and expenditure responsibilities of
municipalities. After the Municipal Transfer law had been passed and transfers begun, the Bank
and IMF advocated defining more clearly the expenditure responsibilities of municipal
governments within the new fiscal transfer context. The project financed studies by MHCP to
clarify municipal and central line ministry competencies and prepare revisions to the fiscal
transfer law and municipal law. Both are in final draft form awaiting the new administration's
review and approval.

37.     The Municipal Environmental Management component was closely linked to country and
global priorities. The project activities supported explicit country objectives to:
    a. Strengthen environmental management at the municipal level and identify environmental
        issues in the municipalities including water (quality and quantity), solid waste
        management, deforestation, watershed management, fire and biodiversity loss;
    b. Harmonize local municipal and federal environmental laws and initiate their enforcement,
        particularly in solid waste management and water conservation;
    c. Establish alliances between MARENA and the local governments; and
    d. Foster NGO participation (achieved through membership in the Municipal Environmental
        Commissions and as the implementer of subprojects financed by FAM).

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

38.     Achievement of the PDO was assessed in terms of the success in improving both the
performance and the longer term capacity (including efficiency, accountability and effectiveness)
of rural municipalities to:
    · Provide local public infrastructure, deliver municipal services;
    · Protect the environment and sustainably manage natural resources; and
    · Promote local economic development.

39.     The PDO was fully achieved as the project succeeded in improving the performance and
long term capacity of rural municipalities in all three areas, with only minor to moderate



                                                 12

shortcomings. Below the performance on PDO and outcome indicators as defined in the PAD is
analyzed and assessed. Because the logical framework contains a more complete listing of the
indicators versus the main text of the PAD, the logical framework text and indicators are used for
this review.

40.     The project had substantial achievements in the provision of effective local public
infrastructure and included investments to strengthen municipal services and to promote local
economic development. The PAD defined 6 PDO indicators (four of which were composite
indicators) and 17 output indicators related to providing local public infrastructure and delivering
municipal services. All 6 PDO indicators were achieved and 14 of the intermediary outcome
indicators were fully achieved, 2 partially achieved and 1 was not achieved. The status and
achievement of these indicators is presented below.

41.     The first PDO indicator, to improved local governance indicators in 40 municipalities,
was a composite indicator with 3 sub-indicators and was fully achieved and even exceeded
projections.

42.     The first sub-indicator was to increase community involvement and participation in local
decision-making (for the 32 municipalities of the Rural Municipalities Project, included in
PROTIERRA, from 68% to 80%, for 8 new municipalities from 30% to 60%). This indicator
was measured by the number of municipalities which prepared a five-year municipal plan based
on the participatory methodology developed during PROTIERRA which involved the
participation of community and civil society leaders and the private sector. By the end of the
project all 152 municipalities of the expanded project had prepared five-year municipal
development plans with the participation of communities while 101 included representatives
from the private sector, i.e. producers' organizations. This was 250% of the target. All of the
original forty municipalities had full community, civil society and private sector involvement in
their municipal planning process.

43.     The second sub-indicator was to increase the perception of transparency of municipal
officers by the general public from 50% to 70%. There was no general public survey taken and
thus no data available for this indicator but it can be inferred that the general public's perception
of municipal transparency had favorably increased from the beginning of the project because of
the development of the on-line budget and expenditure reporting system (TRANSMUNI) that all
municipalities use and to which the public has access. The new system has up-to-date budget
and financial execution information, not only on the actual use of the fiscal resources from
transfers, but also on the complete, executed municipal budgets of the latest fiscal year, the
planned budget for the current year, as well as its execution as of the most recent quarter. This
information allows MHCP to monitor the impact of the current fiscal transfer policy on
municipal financial performance as well as allowing civil society and communities to monitor
municipal performance. In the last two years of the project audits were conducted in 110
municipalities compared to only 20 municipal audits conducted annually before the project.

44.     The third sub-indicator was to increase tax revenue of target municipalities from the $9.5
million to $12.5 million. This indicator was fully achieved and exceeded the original target
reaching $17.2 million that represented a 90% increase compared to the 31% targeted increase. This



                                                  13

indicator was chosen during project design to partially measure efforts related to local economic
development. This will be more fully dealt with in the below.

45.     The second PDO indicator was actual vs. planned improvement in coverage, quality
and cost effectiveness of: municipal services; municipal infrastructure; local natural
resources management; and local economic development. While it was anticipated, as
articulated in the PAD, that this composite indicator would evaluate the municipal performance
based on the completion of individual Municipal Development Plans, such review has not been
undertaken, although it is planned for the fourth quarter of 2008. But it can be inferred from the
subprojects that were financed by the project in the original 43 participating municipalities that
the coverage of both municipal services and infrastructure increased as a result of the project.
While FONDEM was operating during the first two years of the project (2001 to 2003), it
financed 547 projects for an average of 13 projects per municipality, at an average cost of
$11,300 per subproject (independent of the community contribution). Of these projects, 81%
were for public infrastructure (that included 42% for transport--rural roads, streets and small
bridges; 18% municipal services--markets, parks, sports facilities, bus terminals, solid waste
facilities, and cemeteries; 7% for electrification; 7% for water supply, sanitation and drainage;
and 9% others) and 19% were for institutional development efforts such as training, computer
equipment, and audits. The EIRR calculated for a sample of the infrastructure projects that were
surveyed five years later (in 2008) resulted in rates of return of 13% or more, with only one
exception. These results reflect well on the likely sustainability of these investments as well as
their initial quality. They are consistent with the expected results -- based on the estimates at
project's appraisal. The improvement achieved in municipal capacities through cartography
databases, financial management and property tax collection have also been critical elements of
the observed improved delivery of municipal services. In some municipalities, the infrastructure
work has prevented flooding through the construction of canals and dikes and contributed to
improvement in the health of citizen through the drainage work done of areas that were a source
of infestation and reproduction of mosquitoes.

                           Numbers of FONDEM Subprojects (2001-2003)

46.     Subsequent to the closing of FONDEM at the end of 2003, investment in the
municipalities was financed by the municipal transfer system, which was nearly double the
amount of the annual FONDEM transfer that had gone to the 43 original municipalities. As a
result of the initiation of the transfer program, the resources allocated by municipalities to
investment increased 42%. In addition to increasing resources, the quality and cost effectiveness
of municipal investments can be inferred to have been high, based on the high level of
community involvement in the planning and oversight process.




                                                   14

47.     The third PDO indicator was the implementation of at least 15% per year of the 5
year Municipal Development Plan (MDP) including environmental aspects. Based on data
from AMUNIC, on average, 20% of the MDPs were executed each year of the 152
municipalities, compared to the project 43 municipalities. Some municipalities reported up to
60% implementation of the 5 year PDMs. While no specific data is available on the extent of
implementation on environmental aspects of the MDP, all MDP included environmental actions
and it could be assumed that they were accomplished at a similar rate as the MDP activities.

48.     The fourth PDO indicator was that the difference between urban/rural investments
ratio and population ratio is inferior to 20% in 90% of the municipalities. This indicator
was fully achieved and exceeded the target. The rural investment ratio based on population was
85% in 43 project municipalities and 80% in the other 112 municipalities (excluding the
municipality of Managua).

49.     The fifth PDO indicator was the improved institutional performance of the
Nicaraguan Institute for Municipal Development (INIFOM) in terms of: perception of the
beneficiaries, as revealed by regular surveys of municipal staff and other municipal actors;
increased number of INIFOM staff deconcentrated to departmental offices (from 40% to
45%); ratio of technical and professional staff to administrative and directive staff (from
15% to 25%); subjectively, on the basis of technical contribution to the national policy
debate on municipal development; and, allocation and productive efficiency of local
government and central government compared and measured in relative terms. This
indicator was partially achieved with 4 of the sub-indicators achieved and one where no data was
available for evaluation.

50.     The first sub-indicator was the improvement in the perception of INIFOM, as revealed by
regular opinion surveys of municipal staff and other municipal actors regarding INIFOM's
institutional performance. Beneficiary assessments were not conducted on a regular bases as
planned in the PAD. However, during the preparation of the new institutional strategy for
INIFOM conducted in October 2006, 84% of the mayors showed an increase in favorable
opinion of INIFOM while also indicated that the institution would benefit from a more
streamlined and focused mandate. Also, it can be inferred that, because of the increased demand
from municipalities for technical support from INIFOM at the beginning of the project, there
were perceptions of increased capacity of INIFOM to respond to their requests based on the
increased level of service they received during the project.

51.     The second sub-indicator was to increase the number of INIFOM staff deconcentrated to
departmental offices (from 40% to 45%). This was fully achieved as 60% of INIFOM staff was
deconcentrated to departmental offices. The deconcentration of INIFOM's staff to its Departmental
branches exceeded its target by 33%.

52.     The third sub-indicator was to increase the ratio of technical and professional staff to
administrative and directive staff (from 15% to 25%). This was fully achieved and exceeded as
technical and professional staff reached a total of 38% of all staff (including administrative and directive
staff).




                                                    15

53.     The fourth sub-indicator was an increase in the subjective estimate of the technical
contribution of INIFOM to the national policy debate on municipal development. As reported by
external stakeholders, including the management of AMUNIC, this indicator was fully achieved.
INIFOM, in accordance with its mandate, played a significant and catalytic role in the
preparation of proposals and lobbying for the approval of the laws related to municipal policies,
based on the increased capacity gained during the project. The laws were: i) Municipal Budget
Regime Law (Law 376, 2001): the norms and general principles that Municipalities require for
the preparation, approval, modification, execution, monitoring, closing, and evaluation of their
budgets, all with citizen participation; ii) Citizen Participation Law and its Regulation (Law 475,
2003, Decree 8-2004): citizen participation regime at all levels, extending the regulation
established in the Law of Municipalities and increasing the population's role; iii) Municipal
Transfers Law (Law 466, 2003) initiating a formula-driven transfer program following principles
of simplicity, transparency, disclosure, automatic operation, and stability; iv) Municipal
Administrative Careers Law (Law 502, 2004) providing for a system of human resources
administration, ensuring training and continuity of local government staff; v) Municipal Hiring
Law (Law 622, 2007) defining the hiring processes, making them more consistent with
municipal conditions.

54.     The fifth sub-indicator was improved allocation and productive efficiency of local
government and central government compared and measured in relative terms. This was fully
achieved as indicated by the strong role that INIFOM played in developing and mainstreaming
the municipal planning system and budget scheme to improve the allocation of resources. This
has resulted in municipalities financing the local population's priority to develop new or upgrade
existing municipal infrastructure. Infrastructure investment represented an average of 81% of
the use of all transfers during the 2004­2007. In light of the participatory planning methodology
employed in the municipalities to focus its investment on local priorities, and that the national
government does its planning and resource allocation without direct citizen participation, we
may infer that the municipal governments will have allocated more efficiently than the national
government. In the last year of the project a study to compare expenditures executed by both
levels of government had to be canceled because of lack of resources due to the budget overrun
in Component 1. This will be undertaken in the future by MHCP.

55.     The efforts to strengthen the capacity of INIFOM were a continuation of similar activities
started under PROTIERRA. As the main national institute responsible for articulating national
support to municipalities, strengthening INIFOM was important to centralize the support that
will be provided to municipalities and activities to be undertaken at locality by sectoral ministries.
However, repeated efforts taken during the project to restructure INIFOM fell short of the
intended goal of assisting INIFOM to become focused only on its key mandates versus being
involved with anything related to municipalities. The major challenge in increasing INIFOM's
capacity was the instability associated with the high turnover of the institutions Presidents and
General Managers and the divided leadership structure of the institution.

56.     The sixth PDO indicator was to improve municipal natural resource and urban
environmental management: municipal land use plans approved in at least 60% of target
municipalities; at least 10 municipalities contribute to the management of protected areas
in their territory; 90% of Municipal Environmental Commission (CAM) established and



                                                  16

60% active with participation of public and private municipal entities; EIA performed and
consulted for 100% of investment projects; and, 60% agricultural and industrial producer
are aware of their responsibilities and environmental duties.

57.     The results on the sub-indicators were that municipal land use plans were approved in all
target municipalities exceeding the target of 60% by 1.6 times and an additional 41 municipal
land use plans are under development. The methodology to prepare environmental and land use
municipal plans was published and is still being used by MARENA and all municipalities in
Nicaragua. Ten municipalities contributed to the management of protected areas in their territory,
the target was 10 and in addition, during and with the support of the project, 9 municipal
ecological parks and 17 private wildlife reserves were established in municipalities outside of the
originally targeted 43 municipalities.             Ninety-five percent of Municipal Environmental
Commissions were established and strengthened (61 commissions) during the project, exceeding
the target of 90% and at least 75% are active with participation of public and private municipal
entities, exceeding the target of 60%. EIA's were performed and consulted in all investment
projects meeting the target of 100%. Seventy percent of agricultural and industrial producer were
made aware of their responsibilities and environmental duties during the project exceeding the
goal of 60%.

58.     Outcomes by Component and Subcomponent. Component A, Rural Municipal
Development, had 4 subcomponents and 17 intermediary outcome indicators. The objectives of
these subcomponents were: i) municipal development financing mechanisms developed and
piloted in targeted municipalities; ii) municipal planning and management improved; iii)
INIFOM management improved; and iv) policy evaluation and dissemination mechanism
established and operational.

59.     Municipal development financing mechanisms developed and piloted in targeted
municipalities. This objective was fully achieved, as measured by four indicators:
            a. average annual US$4 per capita is transferred through FONDEM to
                  municipalities. The project succeeded at transferring US$11.182 per capita (that is
                  279.5% of the targeted $4 EOP) to municipalities through the FONDEM
                  mechanism;
            b. municipal real estate tax collection increased by 20%. Property tax collection
                  actually increased by 220% in nominal cordobas, or by 90% in terms of dollars;
            c. 90% of municipal development committees, as a participatory planning platform,
                  established and meeting regularly. 100% of the beneficiary municipalities the
                  project established a Municipal Strengthening Committee that served as a
                  platform for the participation of citizens in planning; and,
            d. 100% of FONDEM and FAM subprojects pass environmental screening. All
                  FONDEM and FAM subprojects were subject to intensive environmental
                  screening as defined in the Operational Manual. Application of environmental



2Note that this target was achieved in Sept. 2006. Given the planned incremental increase from the central
government, this figure may have been surpassed by Dec. 2007.




                                                       17

                     screening was confirmed during supervision missions including the MTR along
                     with reviews of FONDEM and FAM subprojects by MARENA.

60.      The piloting of transfer mechanism through FONDEM was successfully implemented.
By 2004, when FONDEM was discontinued following the promulgation of Law 466/03, 82% of
the original allocation (US$11 million) was transferred to municipalities. Based on the transfer
mechanism pioneered by FONDEM and once the municipalities improved their financial
management and reporting, a conducive environment was created for fiscal transfer. As the table
below demonstrates, the fiscal transfer to the original, project municipalities increased during the
six years by an average of 90%. In fact the transfer to some areas increased by as much as 180%.

                       Transfer to municipalities 2001 to 2006 (in `000 current US$)

Note: Due to lack of data, six project municipalities are not included: 2 from the department of Rio San Yuan and 4 from Zelaya Central.


61.      The significant fiscal transfer achieved is also indicative of the institutional capacity
achieved in allocating the received resources to priority areas identified by the localities. It is
also a testimony to the improved planning and execution capabilities in the beneficiary
municipalities. In addition, municipalities were audited for the management of their budgetary
resources and no major incidents were reported resulting from the increased transfer.

62.      Municipal planning and management improved. This objective was fully achieved, as
measured by six indicators:
               a. Municipal Development Plans (MDP): 95% prepared and 70% being
                     implemented with participation of communities, civil society and 30% with
                     private sector. This was fully achieved with 152 MDPs prepared (380% of target)
                     and 101 being implemented with private sector, civil society and community
                     participation (360% of target).
               b. Multi-actor Municipal Development Committees (CDM)/Municipal Planning
                     Commissions (COPLAM) established by Municipal Ordinances and operational.
                     This was fully achieved. CDMs and COPLAMs have not only been created in the
                     targeted 43 municipalities but in 120 municipalities and are operational and
                     functioning.
               c. Participation of civil society and COPLAM in budget planning in 80% of targeted
                     municipalities. This was fully achieved in all 43 targeted municipalities (100%
                     versus 80%) and in an additional 58 municipalities.
               d. Budget commissions established and consulted on budget decisions. This was
                     fully achieved in the 43 targeted municipalities. Each year the municipalities
                     report on the budgeting planning process and use of resources. In 1997, it was




                                                                        18

                 confirmed that 125 municipalities were consulting the budget commission on
                 budget decisions.
             e. Municipalities implement improved personnel management systems. This was
                 fully achieved with the preparation, and passage of the Municipal Administrative
                 Career Law that established the requirements and procedures in human resource
                 management (such as hiring, promotion, retirement for staff of municipalities).
                 The Law paved the way for careers in municipalities by professionals thereby
                 contributing to staff stability and thus the observed improved capacity. Before
                 this law, employment in municipalities was treated as a transition mechanism to a
                 more stable job and therefore there was frequent turnover of staff. Also, since
                 staff consider municipality job as temporary and transient, it never managed to
                 create the enthusiasm that is now manifested by staff of these municipalities. This
                 law is in the early stages of implementation in all 153 municipalities of the
                 country.
             f. Municipal staff trained and equipped with improved accounting, financial
                 reporting, investment projects cycle and Municipal Information System (SIM)
                 systems. This was fully achieved with over 2,091 municipal staff trained project
                 management, accounting, cost and budget systems, and municipal information
                 systems (see Training of Municipal Officials table in Annex 2 for more detail on
                 training).

63.     Additionally, as part of improving the capacity of municipalities in monitoring, managing
its activities, including financial monitoring, the project supported the development, deployment
and integration of several systems that were development by PROTIERRA and other projects
that included: information system for project management (Sistema Informacion Gerencial del
Proyecto -- SIGP) cartography system (Sistema de Catastro municipal -- SISCAT) the municipal
tax collection (Sistema de Recaudacion municipal -- SISREC) the financial information system
(Sistema de Informacion Financiera --SAFIN) and other relevant systems. INIFOM played an
important role in developing, deploying and training municipal staff in the use of these systems.
However, during field visits by the ICR team, municipalities complained of not having support
close by and expressed the need to make the systems accessible to local experts so that
troubleshooting could be done at local level. This indicates the improvement in the capacity of
the municipalities and their willingness and preparedness to undertake more responsibilities.

64.     INIFOM management improved. This objective was partially achieved. See above,
paras. 50 to 55 for the discussion of this objective and related indicators in the analysis of the
PDO, "improved institutional performance of the Nicaraguan Institute for Municipal
Development (INIFOM)."

65.     Policy evaluation and dissemination mechanism established and operational. This
outcome was partially achieved. There were three indicators of which two were achieved and
one was not:
             a. Annual evaluation studies completed in a timely manner. This indicator was not
                 achieved. Because of the frequent turnover of the leadership of the institution,
                 annual evaluation studies were never undertaken.




                                                  19

            b. Workshops carried out with high level participation and good press coverage.
                This indicator was fully achieved. Over 40 workshops were carried out in the
                preparation of the five municipal development related laws;
            c. CSD meets quarterly. This was fully achieved. The Decentralization Sectoral
                Commission was very active and met at a minimum quarterly and at time monthly
                until December 2004 when it was replaced by the Decentralization Unit within the
                Office of Public Administration which was part of the ministry of the presidency.
                This new unit was then responsible for coordinating activities with the former
                members of the CSD and others which they did on a regular basis as they
                prepared the national decentralization policy and strategy.

66.     Evaluation activities were designed to be conducted by the Sectoral Decentralization
Commission (CSD) led by INIFOM, including at least three benchmarks ­ baseline, MTR and
final. Baseline and MTR studies were completed that were instrumental in project adjustments
made following the MTR. The final evaluation, however, was not done probably due change of
national administration, new administration at INIFOM and planned on resources were not
available to carry out the final evaluation in a timely manner. INIFOM has committed to prepare
a final evaluation and is in the process of completing the evaluation with its own staff.

67.     The improvement in municipal performance can be summarized from the following
achievements: (i) the increase in municipal revenues from property taxes reflected an improved
cadastre and collection system, and increased support by the citizenry of their municipal
governments; (ii) the training of staff from all municipalities in financial management, the
successful installation of computerized financial management systems (hardware and software
development and installation) in 100 percent of the 43 municipalities, the successful installation
of a computerized property tax system in 100 percent of the 43 municipalities, and the
completion of audits in nearly all municipalities leads to the conclusion that publicly financed
development investment and operations were being more efficiently and effectively managed;
and (iii) the development of multi-annual and annual municipal investment plans in all
municipalities together with the creation and maintenance of consultation bodies (the CDM,
COPLAM and budget commissions) implied the existence of greater participation, accountability
and transparency of local government.

68.     Component B, Municipal Environmental Management had 3 subcomponents and 10
intermediary outcome indicators. The objectives of these subcomponents were: i) municipal
technical capacity for environmental management increases; ii) National Environmental
Information system established and operational; and iii) environmental investments identified
and funded. Each objective and output indicator was fully achieved.

69.     The first outcome, municipal technical capacity for environmental management
increased had four indicators which were fully achieved:
            a. Municipalities enforce and apply 80% of decentralized environmental norms and
                instruments. This indicator was achieved as evidenced by 70 municipalities
                passing 317 municipal (ordenanzas) laws during and with the support of the
                project: 39 to create the environmental municipal units, 24 to pass municipal
                environmental plans, 61 to establish the municipal environmental commissions,



                                                  20

               41 to control public waste, 23 to protect water sources, 106 to control fire and
               protect natural resources and, 47 to manage specific environmental problems. In
               addition, 20 municipal governments signed agreements with INAFOR (the
               forestry Ministry) to manage the forestry permits at the local level. With the
               support of lawyers financed by the project, some have continued with other
               financing, these laws were not just passed, but they were enforced through the
               registry of 433 cases of violation, (341 in environmental pollution, 79 in
               biodiversity).    MARENA also prepared 25 new environmental laws and
               instruments through a participatory process where the views of the municipalities
               were collected. Thirty-one training and consultation workshops were carried out
               where 862 actors participated, such as the local police, NGOs, National Guards.
               Among these are: the water law, amendments to the current environmental law,
               the project for the biodiversity law and the biosecurity law.
          b. Basic technical environmental capacity achieved in each municipality. The
               municipal technical capacity for environmental management increased through 8
               local delegations of MARENA receiving equipment, vehicles, staff and operation
               support. Environmental plans were prepared for 43 municipalities. MARENA
               played an important role to prepare tools and provide technical assistance to
               develop these plans. One output valued by municipalities was the Methodological
               Manual to prepare Environmental Municipal Plans that is currently being updated
               after the project closed. This was a new tool developed by the project. Also, a
               185 courses were provided to 6,643 participants from municipalities in urban and
               natural environmental resources management.
          c. Fifty natural resource management conflicts resolved with alternative conflict
               resolution mechanisms. Fifty-two conflicts were resolved by alternative conflict
               resolution mechanism.
          d. Technical assistance to the municipality of Leon and to the Sutiava indigenous
               organization was carried out.

70.    The second outcome, National Environmental Information system established and
operational, had two indicators which were fully achieved:
          a. Data base, meta data, networks, Esteli regional node, training/user manuals and
               user centers established.    Four regional nodes were established, covering 70
               municipalities in 8 departments, with 22 national institutions gathering data. Fifty-
               five environmental indicators were developed in 10 thematic areas for monitoring.
               Three National reports on the state of the environment were produced utilizing the
               information system and, 8,000 documents (maps, images, studies, articles) were
               organized, a website designed and maintained, and over 15 dissemination
               products published.
          b. All of the MDPs incorporate environmental information and planning. As a result
               of having an environmental specialist in each municipality, product of the project,
               attention was given to including an environmental section in each MDP. This was
               confirmed by an external evaluation in May 2007.

71.    Additionally, an executive committee with inter-institutional committees was established
which guides the operation of the information system and continues to operate today, while



                                                 21

MARENA houses the central node. Other key outputs achieved include: i) guide to identify and
measure indicators at the municipal level; ii) atlas of all forests in the country; iii) three national
reports on the state of the environment in Nicaragua that includes 10 different themes
(deforestation, water quality); iv) a guide for investors has been completed and will be used in
negotiations of any investments as NAFTA gets underway; and v) a law on "access to public
information" was passed in 2007. This law requires that all government institutions provide "free
of charge" information, including environmental information, to the public. In the case of
MARENA, they are required to provide information on the state of the environment in Nicaragua.
The passing of this law has been positive and ensured that the SINIA systems financed by the
project is continued.

72.    The third outcome, environmental investments identified and funded had four indicators
of which three were fully achieved and one was not because the number of municipalities
increased):
            a. At least 1 subproject per year in 80% of participating municipalities. There was
                much greater demand for environmental subproject financing then resources
                available. The reason is that the number of municipalities and the number of
                years for the project increased (doubled) with no increase in resources. Because
                municipalities participating in the environmental fund were increased from 40
                (original design) to 70, while 157 subprojects were implemented during the 6
                years of project implementation, this did not result in 1 subproject per year in
                80% of the municipalities.
            b. At least 100 implemented subprojects. A total of 195 subproject proposals were
                submitted and 157 were approved and implemented, as defined in the municipal
                environmental    plans   (81   institutional   strengthening    of    the   municipal
                environmental unit subprojects, 45 conservation of biological diversity and forest
                resources subprojects, 27 in clean technology such as solid waste management
                and improved water quality and management; and 4 in sustainable economic
                development).
            c. The fund (FAM) provided to municipal governments an average annual transfer
                of $1.5 per capita per year.
            d. All subprojects passed environmental screening.

73.    Improved performance of rural municipalities to promote local economic
development. One of the composite PDO indicators included actual vs. planned improvement
in coverage, quality and cost effectiveness of local economic development. This indicator
was partially achieved and exceeded in increasing resources available for local economic
development. The essence of the project's design to increase local economic development was
based on securing additional financing for municipalities to fund local investments based on
needs defined by the communities in the participatory planning process utilized to prepare the
PDM and defined in the annual municipal budget and promote local economic activities. The
two main efforts of the project were to increase municipal funding sources by i) piloting the
FONDEM concept which was to have an annual fiscal transfer to participating municipalities
based on population and poverty criteria in the range of 3-5% of domestic income (at the
beginning of the project this was less than 1% of the general budget); and ii) increase local
resource mobilization.      The premise was that increasing local resources available for



                                                22

municipalities and including local economic development promotion activities in the PDM,
would increase local economic development.

74.     The project exceeded the target by having the piloted FONDEM mainstreamed into a
fiscal transfer law for not just 43 but all 153 municipalities and a current annual transfer
representing 8% of national tax revenue, local tax revenue increased by 90% from $9.5 million
to $17.2 million. PDMs were prepared with community participation and "demand driven," local
economic development was included. Key activities which promoted local economic
development were the formulation of local development plan through the participation of citizens
and the productive infrastructure works undertaken (such as connection to electrical grid,
improvement in rural roads, markets, etc) which contributed to the creation of an enabling
environment for private investment. As part of their development plan, municipalities are also in
a better position to attract financing from different donors. Anticipated subproject demand from
municipalities for subprojects for market information and facilitation services, local fairs and
exhibitions, support to technical assistances and business promotion services, vocational training
workshops, agricultural storage and processing facilities was limited.

75.     As a result of the Fiscal Transfer Law and Law 466, being enacted in 2003, which
assigned new specific tasks related to municipal development to MHCP and CGR, the project
was restructured in December 2004 and a third component was created to support the
institutional development of MHCP and CGR. The remaining allocation of FONDEM resources
were reallocated to support the discharging of new mandates by these institutions. In December
2006, OAP was included so as to support the decentralization policy and strategy preparation.

76.     Six key outcome indicators were added to the project of which five were fully achieved
and one was mostly achieved. These indicators were:

           a.   Processing time for fiscal transfer requests decreased from 28 days to 10 days as
                managed by MHCP. Part of the objectives was the simplification of the MHCP's
                internal procedures regarding the disbursement of intergovernmental fiscal
                transfers. The findings indicate that the achievement of the target has been greater
                than expected. The target was to reduce the actual number of processing days
                from a range of 15 to 20 days on average, to only 10 days. Based on SIGFA
                reports of 100% of the municipalities, it was found that, by the end of fiscal year
                2007, the disbursement process had been reduced to an average of 8 days, rather
                than 10 days, as expected. Fiscal neutrality in national budget for municipal
                transfers from 33% to 100% as also managed by MHCP. This indicator was fully
                achieved by reaching 97% neutrality in 2006 and 100% in 2007. This was done
                by assessing and eliminating the duplication in budget expenditure from the line-
                ministries and the municipalities.
           b. 20 key MHCP staff trained in fiscal decentralization, municipal finance, best
                practices in decentralization, and the new roles of MHCP in public sector
                management;. This indicator was fully achieved. As part of the training sub-
                activity, twenty-five (25) MHCP staff was trained, which surpasses the project's
                target of twenty (20) staff. Also, the participants benefited from the
                decentralization experience of Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Brazil, and Colombia y



                                                 23

   Venezuela. Additionally, 50 mayors and 483 municipal officials were trained. The
   number of municipal government officials trained was about seven times greater
   than its target.
c. Municipal Transfer Information System (TRANSMUNI) operating and processing
   information on transfers and municipal expenditures.                The municipal
  administrations can electronically request their transfers and provide all the
  requirements through the internet. For this purpose a web-page based system
  called TRANSMUNI (Municipal Transfers) was created. Each municipality can
  request on line its corresponding disbursement, and provide the executed budget,
  using its identification number ("Comprobante Unico Contable"). Also, as
  planned, all the municipalities in the country currently use TRANSMUNI. About
  80% of them are connected on line directly from their own municipalities, while
  the rest access the system outside their jurisdictions due to the lack of phone lines
   or Internet service. TRANSMUNI system is also being used to update municipal
   budgetary information. This information on municipal finance is being captured
   according to current legal procedures on budgetary management, and this activity
   is being coordinated with INIFOM. The target was to have reliable information
   for at least 59 municipalities by December 2006. As of December of 2007 the
   MHCP had the executed budgets for all the 153 municipalities.
d. 184 municipal audits to be conducted by CGR or contracted to external audits
  firms). This indicator was fully achieved and exceeded by 130%. Actual audits
  were conducted were 242 with another 107 being currently being initiated. The
  aim of the component was to strengthen CGR's capacity to carry out ex-post
   audits and improve the municipalities' internal controls. The initiation of a
   program of regular audits of all municipalities, under the supervision of CGR, has
   provided increased accountability and transparency in municipal administrations
   across the country and in addition to being mandated by law, has set a precedent
   for continuing such audits in the future. Sustainability of continued audits is likely
   because in the years 2005 and 2006 audits, CGR cofinanced the audits but in 2007
   and beyond, all municipal audits will be financed 100% by the municipalities. As
   a result of the project, CGR expanded its coverage to all the 153 municipalities
   with the support from IDA, the Embassy of Denmark, GTZ, DIFID, the
   Government of Finland and the Government of Nicaragua. Issues were identified
   in 42 of the audits carried out with Bank's funds which involved mainly
   inconsistencies between the financial statements and auxiliary accounts, lack of
   integrity of financial information and lack of supporting documentation for
   transactions. For those audits which presented only minor debilities, CGR notified
   the municipalities about the auditor's recommendations and the municipalities
   will had 90 days to implement them. For those requiring additional special audits,
   CGR included them in its 2008 operational plan. Field visits indicate that the
   municipalities are responding positively to the issues found and are willing to
   implement the auditor's recommendations. During project implementation, seven
   training events aimed at municipal internal auditors from sixteen municipalities
   and 13 private audit firms were carried out. The training helped internal auditors
   to better understand their responsibilities and duties, thereby allowing auditing
  reports to be better presented. Additionally, twenty-five Internal Auditing Units



                                    24

                were created, five of which with Bank funds, in addition to the six that the CGR
                had registered during the project's initial stage. Seven, Internal Auditing Units
                were strengthened, two with Bank's funds, through technical assistance for the
                preparation of their work plans, delivery of computer equipment and office
                furniture. In addition, the internal control systems of sixty municipalities were
                strengthened through reviews of adjustments and implementation of Technical
                Standards for Internal Control.
            e. Development, publication, and dissemination of a policy, strategy, and program
                for National Decentralization and Local Development. This was partially
                completed. Through the inclusion in the project of the Office of Public
                Administration (OAP) and their Decentralization Unit, the Bank and other donors
                supported OAP to finalize the Decentralization Policy.             It was approved by
                presidential decree in March 2006. Support was also given to prepare and finalize
                the Decentralization Strategy. It was formulated and widely consulted in over 40
                workshops and published in December 2006. Unfortunately, the program to
                support the strategy was not developed and was left for the current administration
                to complete which has not done so to date.

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost, and
comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

77.     To examine the efficiency of the subprojects financed by FONDEM and FAM, an
economic analysis was conducted of a stratified sample of the subprojects in the main regions
covered by the SRMDP. The sample focused on the types of investments (subprojects) in which
most of the capital resources have been allocated. A team visited each subproject in the selected
sample and collected information on the actual cost and benefits and calculated the Economic
Internal Rate of return and Net Present Value for a sample of 20 subprojects implemented in
2002 and 2003. During this exercise due to changes in some municipal authorities, especially
following municipal elections in 2004 some problem in accessing data was encountered.

78.     The economic analysis of sampled subprojects was based on the following assumptions:
A discount rate of 12 percent, shadow price of labor and land at 100 percent of market value, and
shadow price of tradable of 130 percent of market price. The range of the EIRR fluctuates
between ­10% and 97.28%. Three sub-projects indicated small negative EIRR, being the largest
of them equal to ­10%. The typical sub-projects for street construction ("adoquinados") resulted
in EIRRs usually greater than 80 percent. One project on a municipal road yielded a 97.28%
EIRR. The rest of the sub-projects studied yielded EIRRs greater than the opportunity cost of
capital (i.e., 12%) and mainly included water supply systems and electrifications. The weighted
average of the EIRR for a sample of the 15 project financed by FONDEM was EIRR = 34.86%
In contrast, the results suggest that the subprojects financed by FAM seem to have lower EIRRs
than those financed by FONDEM. Based on a sample of five subprojects the EIRR ranges from
as low as ­13.93% to as high as 25.97%, while the weighted EIRR for these five subprojects
examined was ­0.84% (Annex 3 Table 2B). These results are apparently related to the difficulty
in quantifying all the environmental benefits associated with these types of subprojects.




                                                 25

79.      Given the above empirical results the EIRR for project investments as a whole is
classified as satisfactory and highly satisfactory, particularly for projects in the transport sector.
These findings are fairly consistent with the expected results -- based on the estimates at
project's appraisal. However, it should be noted that other potential net benefits were not
quantified, such as those coming from local capacity building, technical assistance and training,
and participatory planning -- given the inherent difficulties to quantify them.

80.      In order to assess the institutional development activities of the project, the concept of
cost-effectiveness was applied. The assessment included those activities related to the
strengthening of municipalities, decentralization of environmental management, strengthening of
INIFOM, support to the decentralization reform process, the implementation of an environmental
information system, and implementation of evaluation and policy development. Based on the
empirical results reported in Annex 3 on Cost-Effectiveness, it may be concluded that the
achievement of the targets for each of the above project activities was generally highly effective.
The above also considering that the actual cost of most of these activities was not greater than
the indicative cost included in the PAD, with the exception of the cost associated with the
strengthening of INIFOM. Given these objectives and their quantifiable indicators (as reported
also in Annex 3), it may be argued that the cost-effectiveness of the expenditures allocated for
the financing of the institutional development activities, as a whole, was satisfactory.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

81.      Although there were some problems in the design of the project at entry and problems in
the implementation of the evaluation as designed, the strong results of the project, discussed
above, leads to the overall outcome rating for the project as "Moderately Satisfactory." This
rating is justified by: (i) the success of the decentralized investment component; (ii) progress in
municipal capacity development both in terms of municipal administration and investment and in
terms of local environmental management; and (iii) the sustainability of most if not all of the
advances and innovations introduced by the project, especially the provision of resources to rural
municipalities through the municipal transfer system, the incentives that continue to be in force
for municipal capacity development and effective planning and implementation of investments,
and the Environmental Information System (SINIA).

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

82.      The direct impact of the project on poverty reduction and gender were not assessed
through project evaluations, and could not be assessed by the ICR. With regard to the impact of
the project on indigenous peoples see section 2.4 above.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)




                                                    26

83.     Positive institutional change and strengthening were achieved primarily in the
municipalities, MHCP and MARENA, and to a lesser extent in CGR. During the past 4 to 6
years, Nicaraguan municipalities have received training and technical assistance for their staff,
help in introducing better financial, planning and cadastre systems, have gained experience in
planning and implementing small investment projects, and have received audits of their accounts
for two years (2004 and 2005). As a result of these inputs these municipalities, taken as a whole,
have experienced a substantial capacity improvement ­ an improvement that is continuing to be
supported by AMUNIC and by INIFOM (via other programs).

84.     Since the institutionalization of the municipal transfers in 2004, MHCP has developed
capacity in its Decentralization Unit to manage and maintain data and conduct analysis on those
transfers using a web-based system which is directly accessible to the municipal governments.
Similarly, CGR has undertaken a new role, of providing audits of municipal accounts. While
resources are not assured for continuing this role, availability is promising, given the widespread
concern that municipalities use wisely the relatively large new fiscal transfer that is now coming
to them with few strings attached.

85.     MARENA and the municipalities have been strengthened substantially in the area of
environmental management over the past 4 years. In the case of MARENA this comes through
an internal process of reorganization, continuity of its top leadership over the past 5 years, and a
successful experience in working with the municipalities to promote increased capacity for
environmental management. The success of SINIA has led to the SINIA unit being relocated
directly under the Vice Minister. With project closing, 6 position of SINIA were absorbed by the
ministry, and the remaining 14 positions have been financed by different donors. With the
passage in 2007 of the Access to Public Information law, even greater demand for and valuing of
SINIA's services are expected.

86.     Although the activities planned to be executed by OAP were cancelled due to
overspending of INIFOM, the Bank team was active in assisting OAP to finalize a
Decentralization Policy and Decentralization Strategy and consult that policy and strategy with a
wide audience. That new policy, which has been approved by the President, plus a draft
Decentralization Strategy are significant accomplishments and have laid the ground work for
future decentralization efforts.

87.     Finally, INIFOM, supported by international donors and consultants, was strong in
delivering TA and advocating for improvement in government policy and laws. However, due to
its role as advocate, provider of TA and execution of the project, INIFOM has distributed thinly
its limited capacity among these competing needs. Heavily relying on consultants, INIFOM
delivered the necessary support in the implementation of this project, it was not able to transform
itself into an efficient institutions with clear and limited mandate in decentralization.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

88.     Unintended positive outcomes of the project, which were observed during field visits,
included: (i) improvement of living standard of the population due to better services, access to
clean water and electricity; (ii) improvement in managing sources of disease preventing the
accumulation of waste water through construction of drainage that used to stay in the


                                                   27

neighborhood creating a fertile ground for reproduction of mosquitoes and other infectious
diseases; (iii) reduction in local flooding through better planning and drainage construction in
localities; (iv) creation of economic opportunities, such as taxis due to improved access to
neighborhoods; and (v) improved access to markets not only due to improved roads but also
improved marketing places constructed by municipalities.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

89.      As detailed in section 2.5, Post-completion Operation, key aspects of the project have
already been institutionalized through the successful implementation of the Municipal Transfers
law and are continuing post-project.        Continued strengthening of municipal governance in
Nicaragua has also been ensured through the passage of the Municipal Financial Administration,
Participatory Budgeting, and Solvency law; the Municipal Civil Service Career law; and the
Municipal Cadastre law. Furthermore, while many municipalities still require TA and training to
help in the development of their financial, cadastral and other systems, these services are
continuing to be provided post-project through INIFOM and AMUNIC, and some municipalities
are accessing their own TA directly from the local private sector. Finally, there is recognition by
central government and specifically CGR of the need to follow-up the 2004/2005 municipal
audits with audits for subsequent years. Plans are being made to contract for these audits with a
combination of municipal and external financial.

90.      The risk to the development outcome is assessed moderate as municipalities remain
partially dependent on external funds and programs to provide important TA, training and audit
assistance. A significant contraction in such programs is not expected, but if it occurred would
adversely affect those municipalities that are still in the process of solidifying their process and
procedures for planning, project and financial management, and revenue generation.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

91.      On balance, Bank performance at entry was generally satisfactory, with the overall strong
project design being based directly to the Bank's team understanding and application of the
lessons of the first project, as well as lessons from other experiences. The building of SRMDP's
investment, technical assistance and policy related activities upon the achievements of the first
project allowed for very positive outcomes. Bank performance is rated satisfactory because, as
presented in Section 2.1, only minor weaknesses in the design of the project were encountered,
i.e. of the project evaluation approach, the definition of the role of INIFOM in the project, and
the decision to limit project implementation to three years affected the project.

92.      Quality of entry could have been improved in the following areas:


                                                   28

    a. During project preparation, the capacity of INIFOM was assessed to be weak. This was
        identified as a major risk for the project, as INIFOM was the key implementing agency
        for Component A. To address this problem, the project was designed to support the re-
        organization of INIFOM and to provide technical assistance, training, and financing for
        operating expenses (on a decreasing basis).      In retrospect, consideration should have
        been given to other implementation arrangements, including a greater use of contracting
        out of services, the maintenance (as with the first project) of a project coordination unit
        linked to INIFOM, and more active participation of other institutions such as AMUNIC
        and MHCP in the implementation of Component A. Given that critical problems with
        INIFOM's implementation surfaced at the beginning of the project and persisted
        throughout project implementation, the decision to depend so heavily on INIFOM for
        project implementation was a weakness in the quality of entry.
    b. The project design included plans for assessing the impact of the project through surveys
        of municipal officials, community leaders and beneficiaries, all of which was to be
        designed and conducted or contracted by INIFOM. The planned evaluation studies were
        more numerous and more elaborate than was necessary, and exceeded the capacity of
        INIFOM to manage them. In retrospect, these evaluation tasks should have followed a
        much simpler design and the procedures for data collection should have been addressed
        during preparation and made consistent with institutional capacity.
    c. A decision to limit the project to three years was taken at the appraisal decision meeting.
        The reason articulated then was the uncertainties on the policy priorities of the upcoming
        transition in Nicaragua's national administration.       Given that this transition was
        scheduled to occur less than a year after board approval, the three year implementation
        schedule was unrealistic. Indeed, the transition did contribute to delays in project start-up,
        which in retrospect should have provided a rationale for designing a somewhat longer
        project implementation schedule to take into account the normal problems during
        transitions of national leadership.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

Rating: Satisfactory

93.     Bank staff supervision was strong in a number of key areas. Perhaps most importantly,
supervision was conducted with flexibility, and ensured that there was a rapid restructuring of
project components in 2003/2004 to take advantage of and build on the important reforms in
government's legal framework. This allowed the project to achieve a number of important
outcomes that had been unforeseen at project preparation and appraisal. From 2003 to 2005 the
TTL was located in Managua making the collaboration with government in the restructuring of
project components easier. In addition, supervision successfully: (i) identified procurement and
financial management issues and brought the Bank's specialized personnel, some of which were
based in Managua, to work with government and the implementing agencies to resolve them; (ii)
provided technical input in support of the development of the policy aspects of the project; (iii)
provided technical input in the supervision of the SINIA component contributing to making it
one of the case of arguably sustainable success of an environmental monitoring program; (iv)
effectively ensured and promoted strong coordination with other donors working on municipal

development and decentralization initiatives; and, (v) coordinated with PREM's Development
Policy Loans, and other adjustment operations.

94.     Jointy with the GON, the Bank was flexible in adjusting project activities due to changes
in policies and new circumstances. The Bank team showed this during the passage of Municipal
Transfer Law that re-arranged financial allocation and supporting institutions to be able to
discharge their duties. The Bank team also partnered with the government in responding to the
aftermath of the natural disaster. In addition, the Bank team implemented the Rapid Result
Institutive that contributed in accelerating the pace of project implementation.

95.     Bank staff supervision of the project could have been stronger in one area: ensuring that
the planned evaluation studies and surveys of the project were conducted or were redesigned so
that evaluation questions could be addressed. The lack of follow-up on the evaluation issues
may have been related, in part, to the change in TTL during the first year of project
implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

96.     As described above, the Bank's performance at entry and during implementation was
satisfactory because there were only minor shortcomings, leading to an overall rating Bank
performance with as satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

97.     Overall, government commitment and attention to the project was strong, with some
minor shortcomings. In terms of policy, government actively supported the objectives of the
project and during implementation passed four key pieces of legislation to support municipal
development.      In the Municipal Transfer Law, government increased its financing for
municipalities and made project financing of municipal investment unnecessary, in effect
increasing its own contribution to the project. Government showed flexibility and commitment
to the project objectives through the restructuring of project components, in which important
roles for MHCP, CGR and OAP were defined and included in the project. Government also was
effective in supporting the positive transformation that occurred in MARENA which ended up
functioning very well after its re-organization of 2002, and maintaining consistent and effective
leadership.

98.     However, the organizational changes required to give INIFOM a unified and more
effective leadership structure were not addressed by government. In addition to maintaining a
divided leadership structure (with an Executive President and General Manager separately
appointed), Government made frequent changes in INIFOM's these two position (7 in each in 6
years), creating further difficulties in the development of the institution's programs.

99.     Needed counterpart financing for the Bank credit's decreasing share of operating
expenses was an issue early in the project, leading to an agreement in 2004 to maintain the credit


                                                  30

share at 80%. That modification resolved the problem and counterpart funding was not a
significant issue thereafter.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

100.    The rating of "Moderately Satisfactory" for implementing agencies performance reflects
a rating of moderately satisfactory for one agency (INIFOM), and satisfactory for four agencies
(MARENA, MHCP, OAP and CGR). INIFOM did succeed in implementing FONDEM and the
municipal development activities, leading to strengthened capacity of municipalities in the areas
of project planning and implementation, financial management and property tax management.
However weaknesses in INIFOM's efforts included in the early years the financing of
consultancies not included in project procurement plans, overdue audits, and less than efficient
management of project resources, resulting in a large overspending of the account.
Approximately two-thirds of the project financing was managed by INIFOM. The other four
implementing agencies performed well their roles in managing project activities, including
procurement and financial management.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

101.    In spite of the organizational challenges experienced by INIFOM, and the Government's
lack of effective action in resolving them, the project's objectives were satisfactorily achieved
and, as detailed above, in some key areas surpassed expectations. Given the countervailing,
positive performance of the other four implementing agencies, and the otherwise strong
performance by national government, the overall borrower performance is rated satisfactory for
minor shortcomings.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

102.    There were four important lessons learned from the experience of SRMDP, relating to
approaches to: (i) institutional capacity building in general; (ii) the value of linking project
investment in institutional strengthening with a policy reform agenda; (iii) approaches to
fostering local environmental management; and (iv) the role of municipal associations.

103.    Institutional capacity building. As described above, repeated attempts to strengthen the
capacity of INIFOM during the project were for the most part unsuccessful. Institutional
weakness which had been assessed during appraisal continued throughout the life of the project.
These results underline a very important lesson applicable across many development contexts: it
is very difficult to "build" capacity in an institution if initial conditions, for example the presence
of basic capacity and commitment, are not favorable. The past experience of INIFOM was
perhaps the best indicator of future problems, and the allocation of significant technical
assistance, training and other inputs could not effect improvements absent a change in the basic
framework and incentives within which the institution was operating.                The experience in
SRMDP counsels us to look more broadly for other strategies and approaches to achieving
objectives (e.g. of implementing a municipal strengthening program) rather than assuming that


                                                  31

"capacity building" of a given institution whose formally stated mission encompasses that
objective can bring about the desired result.

104.    Linking project investment with policy reform. SRMDP showed how to effectively
accompany a process of decentralization reform undertaken via a series of laws, with an
investment project that supported the implementation of the decentralization process. It did this
especially through its support for municipal capacity development (in participatory planning,
financial management, cadastre and local tax development, and project management) and
support for the definition and implementation of a fiscal transfer mechanism itself. The design
of the fiscal transfer policy was generated from project experience (both the first and second
Rural Municipal Development Projects) and the continuing project contributed significantly to
its success. In the implementation of the policy two important elements came together: (i) the
presence of a long-standing municipal strengthening technical assistance and training efforts
which, with the support of multiple bilateral and multilateral organizations, provided expertise to
the municipalities; and (ii) the existence of incentives contained within the fiscal transfer system
and formula themselves to take advantage of this assistance and to put in place improved
planning and administrative systems in the municipality.

105.    Fostering local environmental management. The inclusion of the municipal
environmental management component was initially criticized for being an add-on (i.e. putting
two projects in one). However, the emphasis on decentralized, local and municipal action in
all the three of its subcomponents (municipal environmental investment through a dedicated fund,
FAM; support for municipal environmental management through legal staff working with
municipalities and development of municipal councils; and creation of an environmental
information system with municipal and NGO participation) was a key element to their success.
It is quite likely that without being linked to a larger effort in support of decentralization to
municipalities, these efforts would not have developed so effectively. Also assisting in the
success of these efforts was: (i) consistency and effectiveness in the leadership of the involved
ministry, MARENA; and (ii) consistency and effectiveness in the supervision by the Bank of the
most complex of the subcomponents, SINIA, which received substantial input from one
specialized Bank staff member throughout the life of the project. Citizen participation in
environment efforts.      The participation of volunteer organizations particularly youth was
unexpectedly very effective as they became partners in solving some of the environmental
problems and establishing environmental programs. Many persons interviewed recommended
that any future projects spend significant investments in environmental education combined with
small grants to carry out citizenship programs.

106.    Role of municipal associations. One key ingredient for success was the participation of
AMUNIC (the Association of Municipalities) in several aspects of the project (training,
municipal plans, environmental commission, etc.) that ensured the continuity of many of the
programs despite political changes which resulted in leadership and staff changes in
municipalities and national government alike. In particular, AMUNIC played a strong role in the
environmental agenda with its environmental unit staffed with highly qualified staff.

indicators, 13 were fully achieved and 2 were partially achieved with one indicator (#9) not
achieved because the program was so successful that it was expanded to twice the number of
municipalities thus the average per municipality as projected in the PAD was not achieved (see
Data Sheet). Additional measures of output by component are presented below.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

1.     The economic analysis has been based on a stratified sample of the subprojects financed
by FONDEM and FAM in the main regions covered by the SRMDP. Most of the subprojects are
located in the regions (Departments) of Leon and Chinandega. Between 53% and 64% of the
yearly projects were built in these two areas, which represent about 54% to 65% of the total
investment -- as shown in Tables 3 and 3.1 below. Considering these results, the stratified sample
of subprojects for this analysis was drawn from these two regions.

2.     Also, special attention was given to the typical investments (subprojects) to which most
of the capital resources were allocated. A project evaluation team visited each municipal
subproject of the selected sample, and collected information on their actual cost and benefits.
The Economic Internal Rate of return and the Net Present Value were calculated for a
preliminary sample of 11 subprojects implemented in 2002 and 2003 out of a total of 20
examined subprojects. This is equivalent to a sample size of about 4% -- Table 4 below). Data
gathering was fairly difficult since the maintenance of municipal records is not systematized, and
the problem is compounded by changes in some municipal staff, especially following municipal
elections in 2004.

3.     The economic analysis of the sampled subprojects was based on the following
assumptions: A discount rate4 of 12 percent, shadow price of labor and land at 100 percent of
market value, and shadow price of tradable of 130 percent of market price. Given these
parameters the results of the calculation show that the range of the EIRR fluctuates between ­1%
and 97.28% (Table 1 below). Only one subproject (a food market) indicates a negative EIRR (-
1%). In contrast, the typical subprojects, such as road rehabilitation ("adoquinados") yield EIRRs
usually greater than 80 percent. About half of the subprojects in the sample refer to road
rehabilitation. Similarly, one project on a municipal road has a 97.28% EIRR. Other than the one
project with a negative rate, the rest of them are characterized by EIRRs greater than the
opportunity cost of capital (12%) and refer mainly to water supply systems and electrification.
Also, it should be highlighted that all the subprojects in the sample yield positive Net Present
Values.

4.     Using the preliminary sample of eleven subprojects, and taking into account the different
magnitudes of their actual investment, the relative weight of these investments was calculated
(Table 2). This result was used to estimate an EIRR for the project as a whole. The weighted
average of the EIRR for the project is about 51.4% (Table 2 below). This figure is substantially
higher that the opportunity cost of capital, which is assumed to be about 12%.



4The Nicaraguan Secretariat of Public Investment (Secretaria Nicaraguense de Inversiones
Publicas ­ SNIP) has set the discount rate of 12 percent.

5.      Given the above empirical results, it may be inferred, that the EIRR for the project as a
whole is classified as satisfactory, and highly satisfactory, particularly for projects in the
transport sector. These findings are fairly consistent with the expected results -- based on the
estimates at project's appraisal. However, it should be noted that other potential net benefits were
not quantified, such as those coming from local capacity building, technical assistance and
training, and participatory planning -- given their inherent difficulties to quantify them. In these
cases cost-effectiveness was used, as explained below

6.        Assessment Based on Cost Effectiveness: Some of the subprojects financed by
FONDEM and FAM do not have yearly quantifiable financial returns. As such, in these cases the
method of Cost effectiveness Analysis was applied, in order to optimize the use of resources,
considering different alternatives of subprojects. This method took into account social, economic,
political, and cultural implications of these subprojects.

7.        The objective of this evaluation was to determine some indicator of the social returns,
using estimates of the population benefited, and actual solution to sanitary, educational and
environmental problems. This was the case, for instance, with the subprojects (or activities)
related to technical assistance and training of human resources. Particular attention was paid to
the value added of these subprojects/activities, of which several of them were financed by the
FAM in the area of environmental protection and conservation, including changes in production
technologies towards more environmentally friendly methods, and conservation of natural
resources, among others.

8.        Effectiveness and Sustainability of the Subprojects: Once the effectiveness of the
subprojects/activities in achieving their intended objectives was insured, in an economic and
satisfactory manner, the main concern was the sustainability of these subprojects in terms of

human and technical resources and municipal budgetary support for their operation. In this
respect, an important role on the sustainability of several of the municipal subprojects has been
the budgetary support of intergovernmental fiscal transfers together with the rewards for
mobilization of local financial resources, including improvements in local tax effort, as
illustrated in the main text of this ICR.

    RESUMEN DEL INFORME DEL CIERRE DEL COMPONENTE DEL PROYECTO DEL
                                            PRESTATARIO

I. Componente A, "Desarrollo Municipal".

    1. El componente apoya al INIFOM para fortalecerse y dotar a los municipios de las capacidades
       necesarias para absorber con mayor efectividad las competencias que el marco regulatorio
       municipal les atribuye y administrar mayores recursos suministrados por el SPDRM como prueba
       para diseñar y ejecutar un sistema de transferencias de recursos descentralizados.

    2. En este sentido, los principales logros de este Componente son los siguientes:

       · Reconversión del INIFOM en una institución más eficiente y eficaz prestando los servicios
          que tiene por mandato de Ley más cercano a los usuarios (municipios). Mayor fortaleza en
          las delegaciones territoriales (60% del personal desconcentrado); mayor cantidad de
          funcionarios profesionales (38% del personal versus el 15% original); mayor participación en
          el debate nacional de políticas de desarrollo municipal.

      · Mayor apropiación de los gobiernos municipales sobre la importancia del acompañamiento
          del INIFOM para apoyarlos en su fortalecimiento institucional.

      · Contribución al diseño e implementación de un sistema de transferencias de recursos
          descentralizados. Con el aprendizaje logrado durante la ejecución del FONDEM, el INIFOM
          hace aportes sustanciales a la propuesta de la Ley de Transferencias. Entre otros, en los temas
          sobre el uso de los recursos, requisitos de acceso y fórmula de distribución.

      · Desarrollo y apoyo en la implementación de sistemas como instrumentos de apoyo a la
          gerencia municipal. Sistema de Planificación Participativa; Catastro; Recaudación, de
          Gestión de Recursos Humanos y de Información.

      · Acompañamiento en el desarrollo de capacidades a los municipios a través de capacitaciones
          y asistencia técnica permanente. Aumento de cobertura de 43 municipios que iniciaron a 153.

      · Fortalecimiento de los municipios medidos a través del incremento en la recaudación de los
          tributos; mayor participación de los ciudadanos en la gestión de su desarrollo; elaboración de
          planes (152 Planes de desarrollo estratégico, 153 Planes de Inversión Municipal Multianual,
          153 presupuestos formulados y consultados de acuerdo a la Ley de la Materia; instalación de
          sistemas financieros y de recaudación; institucionalización de las instancias de participación
          ciudadana (CDM y asambleas de pobladores); concejos municipales con mayor participación
          en las comisiones de seguimiento a la ejecución de planes; servicios municipales prestados
          con mayor eficiencia; inversión definida mediante la demanda de los pobladores y, por ende,
          mejor focalizada.

II. Componente B, "Administración Municipal del Medio Ambiente".

    1. MARENA, con el apoyo del Componente "B" del SPDMR y el involucramiento de los sectores
   económicos y sociales, logró que las autoridades de los gobiernos central y municipal impulsaran un



                                                    50

modelo de desarrollo sostenible con base a la conservación y enriquecimiento de nuestro patrimonio
natural, e integrar una lógica de intervención de los procesos de desconcentración y descentralización
de la gestión ambiental en el marco de la regulación legal nacional.

2. La identificación e intervención de los problemas ambientales críticos de los municipios, fueron
los insumos para generar una gestión ambiental local, estrechamente relacionada con el
fortalecimiento de las estructuras básicas de gobierno y de los mecanismos institucionales destinados
a la identificación, tratamiento y solución de conflictos de naturaleza ambiental y la necesaria
participación de las comunidades locales. Este proceso produjo mejoras en la eficiencia y eficacia del
sector público, favoreciendo la participación de la sociedad civil en la toma de decisiones.

3. De igual manera, apoyó a sentar las bases para dar forma a la construcción de un sistema
ambiental nacional, acorde con las necesidades sociales y económicas, enfocadas a la sostenibilidad
en el largo plazo de estrategias de desarrollo con un mayor significado humano.

4. Los impactos generales que se lograron en la construcción participativa del sistema nacional de
gestión ambiental de Nicaragua, son los siguientes:

    · Manejo de los instrumentos de gestión relacionados a la Política Ambiental, Plan Ambiental
         Nacional y otros documentos estratégicos que han sido elaborados sobre plataformas de
         diálogo y consulta con actores públicos y de la sociedad civil, tanto en el nivel central como
         territorial.

    · Fortalecimiento de la red de delegaciones territoriales del MARENA acercando su
         funcionamiento a la población; apoyo a los municipios en su quehacer ambiental (planes
         ambientales municipales, ordenanzas, inspectoría ambiental, instrumentos de gestión
         ambiental, etc.); firmas de convenios de comanejo de áreas protegidas; y la apertura de
         canales de comunicación con diferentes actores en el ámbito local.

    · Fortalecimiento de las Secretarías de Recursos Naturales (SERENA's) de las Regiones
         Autónomas del Caribe Nicaragüense como brazo técnico de los Gobiernos Regionales en el
         área ambiental.

    · Conformación y funcionamiento de 140 Unidades Ambientales Municipales (UAM), entidad
         de la estructura orgánica de las municipalidades que interviene de forma directa en los
         procesos de aprovechamiento y degradación del ambiente y los recursos naturales. Así como
         140 Comisiones Ambientales Municipales (CAM), quienes fungen como asesores de las
         mesas ambientales dentro de los Consejos de Desarrollo Municipales (CDM).

    · Mejoramiento de la capacidad reguladora en materia ambiental municipal, reflejado en la
         aprobación y aplicación de ordenanzas ambientales locales y reforma al marco legal nacional
         de las municipalidades (Ley 217 y Ley 40 y 261).

    · El involucramiento efectivo de la sociedad civil para dar seguimiento a la aplicación de las
         políticas y normativas ambientales en el ámbito local mediante espacios de concertación
         como los CDM y CAM.

    · Involucramiento del sector privado de manera directa en la gestión ambiental en la
         administración compartida de áreas protegidas con las comunidades y las entidades
         encargadas de su manejo y administración.



                                                 51

         · Creación de 45 Unidades de Gestión Ambiental (UGA´s) para mejorar la inserción en las
            políticas y marco normativo ambiental de las instituciones sectoriales (MTI, MAGFOR,
            INTA, IDR, MINSA, INTUR, FISE, CNE, INAA, ENACAL, INE etc.).

         · Información sistematizada del estado del medio ambiente nacional a disposición de la
            ciudadanía.

         · Fortalecimiento de las redes nacionales y regionales de información, haciendo posible que la
            información ambiental este disponible a cualquier interesado.

         · Aplicación de métodos para la resolución de conflictos ambientales.

         · Complementariedad de las acciones con los gobiernos subnacionales para avanzar en el
            montaje del sistema de gestión ambiental nacional.

         · Se mejoraron las condiciones y el funcionamiento de los sitios de disposición final de los
            residuos sólidos contribuyendo a disminuir la contaminación.

         · Se mejoró la capacidad de planificación estratégica municipal en el ámbito ambiental, al
            contar con una cartera de proyectos que responde a las líneas estratégicas del Plan Ambiental
            Municipal, consensuada en las Mesas de Concertación y que se encuentra inserta en el Plan
            de Inversiones Municipales anuales (PIM) y multianuales (PIMM). Se fortaleció la
            coordinación interinstitucional a través del establecimiento de Alianzas Estratégicas para la
            implementación de acciones conjuntas establecidas en los Planes Ambientales y de Inversión
            Municipal.

                                     INFORME DE CIERRE
                                         12 de Junio de 2008

Fecha de Inicio: Julio 2005
Fecha de Cierre: 31 de diciembre de 2007

El presente informe de cierre es un resumen de las actividades desarrolladas en el marco del Segundo
Proyecto de Desarrollo Rural Municipal (SPDRM), específicamente referido al Componente C-2:




                                                  54

"Fortalecimiento de la Contraloría General de la República" bajo el financiamiento del Convenio de
Crédito No. 3480-NI, con el Banco Mundial.

1. Objetivo General del Proyecto. La mejora del ambiente de control de las administraciones
municipales a través de asistencia técnica para fortalecer los Controles Internos y realizar 151 AuditorÍas
a los Municipios de Nicaragua en los conceptos de: ingreso, egresos, transferencia y evaluación de
Control Interno.

2. Objetivos Específicos del proyecto: 1) Contribuir a la operativización del proceso de auditoría de las
151 alcaldías municipales. 2) Fomentar y coadyuvar a la adopción de las Normas Técnicas de Control
Interno emitidas por la Contraloría General de la República en el ámbito municipal. 3) Promover la
formación de Unidades de Auditorías Internas sobre todo en las cabeceras departamentales. 4)
Fortalecimiento de las capacidades organizacionales y técnicas, sistemas y recursos humanos de la CGR.

3. Evaluación General de Avance. El proyecto es evaluado satisfactorio en su ejecución y en virtud
del cumplimiento de sus objetivos de desarrollo y es considerado satisfactorio en el progreso de su
implementación.

4. Ejecución financiera. Según la Cuarta Enmienda, de fecha 12 de octubre de 2006, al Convenio de
Crédito de Desarrollo No. 3480-NI SPDRM, el presupuesto para el Componente C-2 Fortalecimiento de
la Contraloría General de la República, por lo que corresponde a los fondos del Banco Mundial, quedó
establecido en Dólares (US$): Un Total de U$978,930.00, para Bienes U$61,090.00, para Gastos
Operativos U$210,090.00 y para Servicios de Consultoría U$707,750.00

5. Desempeño del Proyecto: Se experimentaron algunos retrasos debido en gran parte a:
    1) Cierre contable del año 2005 en el Ministerio de Hacienda y Crédito Público, el cual retrasó
        durante las tres primeras semanas del mes de enero de 2006, cualquier ejecutoria de actividades
        del año 2006;
    2) No hubo disponibilidad de fondos para al iniciar las actividades del año 2006, tanto de fondos
        externos como fondos nacionales, de conformidad a las Normas de Ejecución Presupuestaria para
        ese año;
    3) Falta de un procedimiento dentro del marco legal que permita la recuperación del reintegro del
        20% que las Alcaldías deben de hacer a los Organismos donantes y/o a la CGR que ejecuta las
        39 auditoría;
    4) La información de los años 2004 y 2005 en determinadas Alcaldías estaba incompleta,
        inconsistente, producto de fallas en el sistema de registro llevado por las municipalidades;
    5) Problemas de acceso. Falta de energía eléctrica;
    6) Falta de personal calificado en las Alcaldías;
    7) En algunos casos el estado de ingresos y desembolsos requerido para la auditoría no estaban
        elaborados y
    8) Firmas Privadas, se tiene problemas con la baja participación de las mismas en el proceso, y
        finalmente con el resultado de la evaluación técnica.

6. Déficit de Recursos Financieros del Proyecto: Dado que los fondos depositados a la cuenta
especial de INIFOM ya no existían, y que estaban destinados a la CGR para que concluyera con la
implementación de las actividades definidas en el Convenio, representó la descontinuación de las
auditorías que estaban en trabajo de campo y suspensión de 5 a iniciar.

7. Ejecución del Componente C2 ­ CGR: Bajo el Segundo Proyecto de Desarrollo Rural Municipal
(SPDRM), la Contraloría General de la República con el financiamiento del: i) Banco Mundial, ii) la
Embajada Real de Dinamarca, iii) la Cooperación Técnica Alemana (GTZ), iv) el Department for

    colaboraron con todas las posibilidades a su alcance en la evacuación de los requerimientos de auditoría,
    expusieron su disponibilidad de implementar las recomendaciones al Control Interno y corregir en la
    medidas de las posibles, las incorrecciones en los registros contables.
