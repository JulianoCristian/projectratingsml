The loan and credit\n            would make available a total of US$65 million to help meet\n            priority import requirements of raw materials, spare parts,\n            components and balancing equipment. Counterpart funds would\n            be used to finance development projects in the Central\n            Government budget. The manufacturing sector operating at\n            high levels would generate appreciable employment and\n            substantially increase production of manufactured goods for\n            export and domestic consumption.
