Lessons regarding project\n            design reinforce the importance of clear project objectives,\n            and operational arrangements, as well as particular\n            attention to technical aspects, and managerial aspects,\n            namely, financial, procurement, and monitoring issues.\n            Although the project included substantial technical\n            assistance (TA), it was confined to biodiversity, and other\n            technical matters, rather that being paralleled with TA in\n            managerial aspects, as mentioned above. Also reinforced is\n            the need for an institutional capacity analysis of\n            implementing agencies, at an early stage, to assess its\n            strengths and weaknesses, and, where necessary, changes\n            should be made to tailor the design to mitigate such\n            weaknesses, and in turn, the agency should strengthen its\n            capacity as needed. Investments in natural resources such as\n            forestry, protected areas or watersheds, require continuous\n            activity over an extended period of time. They do not lend\n            themselves to being treated as projects, and may best be\n            conceived as programs which would ensure the longer-term\n            support required. This program could have been presented as\n            two or more projects, in order to allow for stocktaking,\n            including potential changes in project design between the\n            various project phases. Moreover, credit schemes such as the\n            project's Livelihood component, are typically quite\n            difficult; credit in remote areas is extremely difficult due\n            to lack of interest to provide small loans in these areas.\n            Projects or components which have a mix of both credit, and\n            grants are particularly difficult to operate. Lessons\n            concerning implementation indicate that, an implementation\n            which relies on the reimbursement of large numbers of\n            Statements of Expenditures in remote locations, has inherent\n            risks, and requires operation of appropriate mitigating\n            mechanisms, a strong oversight capacity, and sampling for\n            post review. The Mid Term Review provides an opportunity to\n            ensure performance indicators, and as well, to restructure\n            the project, if so required."}, "docdt": "2004-05-14T00:00:00Z"}
