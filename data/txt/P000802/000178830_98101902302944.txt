Rural and Urban Enterprises Project
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:       Republic of Tlhe Gambia
Beneficiary:   The Gambia Coimmercial and Development Bank (GCDB)
Amount:         US$3 million
Terms:          Standard
Relending       US$2.5 million of the credit proceeds will be relent to
Terms:        GCDB at 7-1/2 percent p.a. for eighteen years including
three years of grace to be repaid according to a fixed amor-
tization schedule. The balance (US$500,000) is a grant for
technical assistance to GCDB and a study of housing finance.
The exchange risk will be borne by Government.
Project         To support The Gambia's effort in diversifying its economy
Description:   away from groundnuts, this project addresses the credit needs
of rural and urban enterprises and seeks to build up GCDB as
a financial intermediary. It includes a line of credit to
assist agricultural and agro-industrial investments as well
as small- and medium-scale industries. It also provides for
improvements in GCDB's operations by assisting the rehabilita-
tion of its accounting system, upgrading appraisal procedures
and participating in the financing of its new office building.
The direct beneficiaries of the project will be about 80 rural
and urban enltrepreneurs and artisans who are expected to
create about 700 jobs at an average cost of US$4,000 per job.
Improvements in the financial system will benefit the country
as a whole. The small size of the domestic market, the sea-
sonal nature of the economy and its dependence on groundnuts
and tourism are not particularly conducive to private invest-
ment. However, the size of the project and its targettirg
of intended beneficiaries are appropriately tailored to the
opportunities which do exist; the project therefore bears no
other special risk.
Estimated       The total cost of the project, including taxes of US$0.5 mil-
Cost:           lion, is estimated at US$4.5 million.  Cost estimates, includ-
ing taxes, are given below:

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IDA
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE GAMBIA
FOR A RURAL AND URBAN ENTERPRISES PROJECT
1.         I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of The Gambia for the equivalent of
US$3 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a Rural and Urban Enter-
prises Project. US$2.5 million of the Credit proceeds would be relent to
the Gambia Commercial and Development Bank for eighteen years, including
three years of grace, with interest at 7.5 percent per annum.
PART I. The Economy I/
2.         A report entitlecd "The Economy of The Gambia" (907-GM) dated
December 12, 1975 has been circulated to the Executive Directors. Its con-
clusions are reflected and updated in the following analysis. Country data
sheets appear as Annex I.
3.         The Gambia is a narrow enclave of 10,000 km  inside Senegal along
both sides of The Gambia RiLver. Its population of 540,000 is growing at an
annual rate of 2.4 percent. Owing to urban migration, the capital, Banjul, is
growing at 4.2 percent per year. The population is predominantly illiterate
(90%). Real GNP per capita grew at almost 4 percent per annum between 1960-
75, but has been stagnant i-or the last three years at about $205 (1975 prices).
Sharp variations in output, prices of groundnuts, on which the economy is
heavily dependent, and the value of the British pound to which the Dalasi is
pegged, caused wide movements in the current GNP per capita expressed in US
dollars, i.e., US$205 in 1975, US$185 in 1976, US$219 in 1977 when price
increases more than offset the fall in groundnuts and foodcrops production,
severly affected by poor weather. During that period, concomitant variations
in terms of trade maintained real per capita income about constant.
4.         The economy consists mostly of traditional smallholder rural activ-
ities: agriculture, livestock and fisheries account for 60 percent of the
country's total GDP and employ about 85 percent of the active population.
Agriculture is mostly rainfed, characterized by a short production period
limited to the six-month rainy season, and dominated by groundnut produc-
tion, which is almost the only cash crop of The Gambia. Groundnuts are the
main source of foreign exchange and constitute the basis for the country's
major industrial activity, groundnut oil milling. Millet, sorghum, cassava
and more recently rice are the major food crops, and cattle raising is an
important economic activity. Income per capita of the urban population,
estimated at US$470, is 3.6 times higher than that of the rural population
(US$130).
I/   Substantially unchanged from the President's Report for an Education
Project, P-2156a-GM.



-2-
5.        The Gambian economy is influenced by certain important structural
weaknesses: (a) low productivity of the rural sector; (b) wide seasonal
fluctuations in output and employment (there is full employment at the height
of the agricultural season but this is followed by six months of sharply
reduced activity in most economic sectors, including trade, transport and
industry, all linked to groundnuts); and (c) extreme vulnerability to varia-
tions in groundnut prices and production levels (the latter essentially a
function of rainfall).
Recent Developments
6.        The government has undertaken both to increase the productivity
of the rural sector and to diversify agriculture in order to reduce its
dependence on groundnuts. It has developed irrigated rice along The Gambia
River, cotton in the east, and vegetables around the urban areas. To provide
a sound basis for its agricultural development strategy, the government
requested the U.K. to conduct a nationwide land resource survey which was
completed in February 1975. This led in turn to a comprehensive rural de-
velopment effort (to which IDA is contributing) which concentrates on improve-
ment of rainfed cultivation of millet, sorghum and groundnuts. Other rice and
foodcrop development programs are under preparation.
7.        The Government has also actively promoted the establishment of
hotels, mostly with private financing, by ensuring provision of infrastructure
facilities, participating in the equity of some of these enterprises, and
granting tax holidays and other incentives. These activities have had a
beneficial impact on the balance of payments and have resulted in the creation
of about 2,000 jobs (about 10 percent of salaried employment). Although this
employment is seasonal, it occurs during periods of low agricultural employ-
ment. To mobilize savings and channel credit to local entrepreneurs, Govern-
ment created the Gambia Commercial and Development Bank (GCDB) in 1972. As a
first attempt to spur small industries, it created the Indigenous Business
Advisory Service in 1975.
8.        Economic performance, however, continues to be dominated by the
groundnut sector. In 1975, high prices and yields raised output, exports and
incomes markedly. In 1976, however, groundnut production leveled off and
export prices fell by 12 percent, while import prices rose by a comparable
amount. These factors resulted in a substantial deficit in the current
account of the balance of payments, notwithstanding low import growth in real
terms.  In 1977 a decline in groundnut output was offset by favorable export
prices; imports rose slowly in real terms, but there was still a sizeable
current account deficit as the cost of imports was pushed up both by higher
world prices and the decline in the value of the Dalasi.  Throughout this
period of low growth and rising import costs, the Government nevertheless
managed to maintain a satisfactory overall financial position, as capital
inflows financed most of the current account deficits and foreign exchange
reserves, though declining, were kept above 4 months of imports. With
respect to public finance, current expenditures were held below current budget
revenues, and modest budgetary savings were available for public investment.



3-
Development Prospects
9.        During 1975-1985 GDP is projected to grow by only 2.5 percent p.a.,
about the same rate as population growth, with very low growth in the first
five years of the period, and growth of about 4.0 percent p.a. between 1980-
85. The main factors underlying these projections are the very slow average
growth of the groundnut subsector, which will be depressed by unfavorable long
term price trends, and more rapid growth of food crops, services, and small-
scale enterprises in the early 1980s. The projected unfavorable long-term
groundnut prices together with a rapidly increasing cost of imports means that
The Gambia will face a loss of real purchasing power. Whereas gross domestic
income was 8 percent higher than GDP in 1974, in 1980 it is expected to be 13
percent lower.
10.       The Government is implementing its first Five-Year Development
Plan which covers the 1975-80 period.  This plan emphasizes the productive
sectors: agriculture, livestock, fisheries, industry, and tourism. It also
includes urban and transport infrastructure and stresses the development of
skilled manpower. The plan calls for gross public investments of US$143
million (1977 prices); this corresponds to annual expenditures of about 23
percent of GDP, a sharp increase over the past when total public investment
averaged only 5-6 percent cof GDP.
Financial Prospects and Foreign Aid
11.       Government's ability to implement the Development Plan will be
hampered by diminishing public savings. In recent years the Government
managed to generate small budgetary surpluses as a result of its efforts to
improve tax collection and restrain the growth of recurrent expenditures.
Assuming that groundnut prices decline as forecast, however the Gambia Produce
Marketing Board (GPMB) will be unable to generate sizable surpluses over the
Plan period. Consequently,, public savings, which reached a high of US$17
million after debt service in 1974, are expected to be much lower over the
Five-Year Plan period than had been assumed at the time of Plan preparation,
and development expenditure will also be less than planned, as a consequence.
12.       Partially offsetting the decline in public savings, however, foreign
aid disbursements have increased sharply over the past three years from US$7
million in 1976 to US$15 million in 1977; and disbursements in 1978 are
forecast to be US$19 million. IDA disbursements represented 4 percent of
disbursements in 1976, 6 pesrcent in 1977 and will not exceed 8 percent in
1978. Thus the bulk of the large increase came from the Gambia's traditional
donors (U.K., Germany, EEC, AfDB): the increase in foreign aid is expected to
be maintained since a number of OPEC countries have substantially increased
their commitments to the G;ambia in recent years (from $0.5 million in 1975 to
an estimated $22.7 million in 1978).
13.       Our projections sghow that Government should be able to finance at
most about 20 percent of its total development program. However, these
projections are particularly sensitive to the groundnut situation. A single
bad crop, a slower rate of growth in groundnut output, a drop in groundnut



- 4 -
prices beyond forecasts or a combination of these factors could seriously
affect the Government's ability to contribute to the realization of the
Plan's objectives. The Government is therefore justified in seeking external
financing on concessionary terms as well as the foreign financing of local
costs in appropriate cases.   With a continuation of present policies we
expect The Gambia to be successful in mobilizing finance on appropriate terms;
accordingly, debt service will not impose an unduly heavy burden on budgetary
receipts. Because of the diversification of foreign aid donors, the exposure
of IDA is expected to decrease from 40 percent of total outstanding debt in
1974 to less than 20 percent in 1985.
PART II. Bank Group Operations in The Gambia
14.       To date the Bank Group has financed four operations in The Gambia
totalling US$13.9 million of which US$6.6 million has been disbursed as of
March 31, 1978. One credit of US$2.1 million in FY70 (187-GM) was for re-
habilitation of the port of Banjul, essential for a country so vitally
dependent on foreign trade; due to a sharp increase in construction costs
following project appraisal, a US$2.4 million supplementary credit was added
in FY74. The second operation involved a US$1.3 million credit (333-GM) for
the irrigation under rice cultivation and for the preparation of a follow-up
project. A third project co-financed by the AfDB and KfW and for which a
US$4.0 million credit (602-GM) was signed in January 1976, focuses on the
development of the tourism sector and, moreover, aims at improving public
utilities in Banjul and sub-urban areas. In addition, a credit of US$4.1
million (644-GM) was approved in FY76 for a Rural Development Project, co-
financed by ODM and BADEA. The project improves agricultural extension
services, transport and marketing infrastructure, provides farmers' training
and agricultural credit. Project implementation in The Gambia has been
generally satisfactory. Notes on the execution of ongoing projects are
presented in Annex II.
15.       A US$5.5 million credit has recently been approved for a first
education project. It would assist the Government in improving secondary
education, strengthen educational administration and planning, expand the
training of skilled workers, technicians and para-medical personnel, and
upgrade middle-level managers and administrators.  Recently, road construc-
tion has been the focus of considerable attention from a variety of external
aid agencies. However, present road maintenance operations are not sufficient
to adequately maintain the existing network. The Government has therefore
requested IDA to assist in executing a maintenance program. The proposed
highway maintenance project would include technical assistance and training,
procurement of equipment, and rehabilitation of about 200 kms of laterite
roads. Finally, to stimulate further development in agriculture, agro-
industries and small- and medium-scale enterprises, the proposed IDF project
will provide necessary term resources to finance investments and will
strengthen the Gambia Commercial and Development Bank, the major financial
intermediary in the country.



- 5 -
PART III. The Sector
16.        Employing 85 percent of the active population and generating 90
percent of exports, agriculture is the mainstay of the Gambian economy.
Groundnut production, the dLominant crop, is complemented by a variety of
minor cash crops (cotton, limes and palm kernels) and cereal production (rice,
sorghum and millet) which are insufficient to meet the country's requirements.
Most farms remain small andL traditional, but a few progressive farmers are
diversifying into fruits and vegetables, poultry, livestock and fishing.
Livestock remains traditional and needs to be modernized. Fishing, mostly
artisanal, is growing rapidLly.
17.        Industry constitutes a small share of the Gambian economy with
manufacturing and construction accounting respectively for 2.7 percent and
4.8 percent of GDP. Only hLalf the active urban population of 56,000 are wage
earners involved in industry and services. Employment is highly seasonal and
coincides with the groundnut processing and tourist seasons. The major
sub-sectors are:
a.   Modern industry.  Modern industry employs only 4,500
workers. It consists mainly of groundnut processing
by the Gambia Produce Marketing Board which accounts
for 90 percent of the modern manufacturing sector's
value added. Two Government-controlled fish process-
ing enterprises and a few Gambian-owned import substi-
tution industries account for the balance.
b.   Informal Sector.  The informal sector is a substantial
employer engaging roughly 5,000 artisans.  Half of them
are involved in traditional handicrafts such as pottery,
jewelry, weaving and dyeing; others work as tailors,
blacksmiths, repairmen, mechanics and woodworkers.
Most of these activities are concentrated in Banjul.
c.   Construction and Housing.  Construction provides em-
ployment to 4,700 workers and a few Gambian-owned firms
have emerged from the informal sector and are capable of
large construction jobs. Most private housing construction
is done on a piece-work basis carried out by petty contractors
without technical skills and access to credit.
d.   Tourism.  More than 2,000 jobs have been created by
tourism which has grown rapidly as a result of Gov-
ernments's promotion efforts.  Increased tourist
arrivals and further investments will be dependent
on attracting tourists from new markets like Germany
and the United States.
18.        The potential for diversifying the economy, although limited, offers
The Gambia a range of investment opportunities. In the agricultural sector,



- 6 -
cereal grain production can be increased to reach self-sufficiency. Fish,
poultry, meat, fruit and vegetable production can be expanded to meet the
demand generated by tourists and the growing urban population. Agro-
industrial opportunities exist for ioo(A processing, animal food production,
food storage and slaughtering facilities. The urban population generates
demand for import substitutes, services and housing while increased agri-
cultural production will stimulate further demand for investment in transport,
storage facilities, repair and other related services. Finally, tourists
offer a market for traditional crafts like jewelry, batik and leather work.
Farmers and local entrepreneurs find it difficult to take advantage of these
opportunities, however, due to the shortage of skilled labor, the lack of
technical expertise, and the limited availability of credit. Moreover, the
Gambian market is too small to offer sizable import substitution opportunities
and the wide variation in consumers' income (tied to groundnut sales and
tourism revenues) inhibits year-round manufacturing of consumer goods.  Fin-
ally, the vulnerability of incomes to groundnut price and output fluctuations
compounds the risk to entrepreneurs.
19.       The Government is trying to remove the constraints facing rural
and urban entrepreneurs. It is strengthening agricultural extension services;
it grants liberal incentives to encourage industries; it is stimulating
tourism by providing infrastructure facilities and granting fiscal incentives
for hotel investments; and it has given impetus to the construction industry
by deciding to contract out most public works. Finally, it has sponsored the
creation of an Indigenous Business Advisory Service (IBAS) to provide exten-
sion services to local artisans and entrepreneurs. Created in 1975 with
UNDP/ILO support and Peace Corps staffing, IBAS has done pioneer work in
bringing basic management skills to about 40 artisans and has launched a
300-member cooperative for the marketing of crafts.  Since artisans have
limited access to bank credit, IBAS sponsored the creation of a UNCDF-financed
guarantee fund and helps its clients prepare loan applications. Continued
UNDP/ILO support and Peace Corps staffing will enable IBAS to expand the scope
of its operations.
Financial System
20.       One of the remaining constraints to development is the inadequate
delivery of term credit. The financial system, consisting of the central
bank, two foreign-owned commercial banks and the Gambia Commercial and
Development Bank (GCDB), is equipped to handle short-term, seasonal agricul-
tural and trade credit. GCDB, which accounts for two-thirds of all out-
standing loans to the economy, is the only bank to have opened branches and
to provide limited term credit.
21.       Credit Policies and Interest Rates.  Credit policies and interest
rates are tailored to the groundnut production cycle: subsistence credit,
crop financing and trade credit granted by the banks are routinely refinanced
by the central bank. This short-term credit is highly seasonal and effec-
tively doubles outstanding credit over a six-month period. Crop financing,
granted to cooperatives and private traders at 7 or 8 percent, is rediscounted



-7-
by the Central Bank at 6 percent. Farmers pay 15 percent for subsistence
credit; traders receiving commercial loans pay from 10 to 13 percent.
Interest paid on savings ranges from 3 to 7 percent on time deposits. GCDB
charges only 8 percent on its term loans. Interest charged by money lenders
in the informal credit system, which plays an important role especially in the
rural areas, is much higher.
22.       To reduce the amplitude of the seasonal credit cycle, Government
has decided to encourage term credit to farmers and phase out subsistence
credit. A first step in this direction is the credit component of the first
IDA Rural Development Project which includes US$2.2 million to supply credit-
in-kind at 11 percent interest. This component, however, is restricted to
cooperative members which represent only 45 percent of the total number of
farmers. Beyond this pilot experience, Government is in need of a cohesive
policy for mobilizing savings and allocating credit for development purposes.
In the past, Government haLs called upon the reserves of GPMB or the central
bank to finance investments on an ad-hoc basis in industry and tourism either
directly or through GCDB. It has also guaranteed a number of loans made by
local and foreign banks. To avoid possible misallocation of its own scarce
resources, Government should establish and follow guidelines governing public
investments and guarantees. In addition, GCDB should be assured adequate
resources and guarantees when it is used as a channel for public investments.
23.       To facilitate th,e provision of term credit, a number of policy
issues still have to be resolved. First the phasing out of subsistence credit
requires a concommitent development of rural savings. Not only is a network
of bank branches across the country necessary, but savings instruments also
have to be made more attractive. A higher interest rate structure would have
the merit of attracting savings into the banking system and optimizing credit
allocation. The structure of interest rates has remained unchanged since
1971 and is well below rates in other countries. Second, to meet the credit
needs in various sectors, Government needs to make funds available for agri-
culture, fisheries, indust:ry and housing. To avoid profusion and duplication,
these funds should be channeled through GCDB and a committee would make
overall credit allocations. Housing deserves attention since there is no
organized flow of funds to finance housing other than Government loans to
senior civil servants. A third issue is GCDB's need for an adequate flow of
term resources. Possibilities under consideration include rediscounting of
term credit by the central bank, allocating central bank profits to GCDB,
consolidating contractual savings and tapping excess liquidity. Finally, GCDB
is called to play a dominant role as a development institution; it is there-
fore important to strengthen its organization and management, and to develop
its project appraisal capability.
The Gambian Commercial and Development Bank
24.       The Institution.  Created in 1972 with UNIDO assistance, GCDB is
the only Gambian-owned bank in the country. As a combined commercial and
development bank, it offers a full range of banking services and finances
all sectors of the economy. With assets of D 40 million in 1977, it is
the largest bank in The Gambia. Its share capital of D 1 million is sub-
scribed by Government (52 percent), GPMB (16 percent) and GCU (32 percent).



-8-
25.       GCDB's management is competent but thinly spread; there are only
12 professionals out of a total staff of 125. GCDB is organized into three
major divisions (accounting, commercial and development) and two support
units (inspection and administration). Half the bank's employees work in
the commercial division, while the development division is the smallest
with only four professionals.   To cope with the anticipated growth in
development lending, GCDB intends to hire four additional project analysts,
but it does not have an engineer. Improvements in GCDB's organization and an
increase in staff are hampered, however, by GCDB's inadequate premises. Its
present building was never designed to handle banking business and is now
overcrowded. Since rental space is not available in Banjul, GCDB plans to
build new offices.
26.       Policies, Procedures and Accounting.  GCDB's Act and By-Laws govern
its lending operations but focus more on commercial than development lending.
Although the central bank regulates GCDB's liquidity, reserves and overall
indebtedness, GCDB needs to adopt a policy statement specifying the terms
and conditions of future development lending.  Its present exposure limit
(D 550,000), except for sub-loans guaranteed by Government, is 25 percent
of its capital and unimpaired reserves, or three times the sub-borrower's
net worth in any one enterprise. For most projects, GCDB's appraisals are
sufficient and complemented by frequent on-site visits during project imple-
mentation. Nevertheless, because it lacks technical expertise, GCDB is
not in a position to assess the merits of complex projects itself. Standard
legal documents are inappropriate and rarely used: the quality of GCDB's
legal work would be greatly improved if it hired a lawyer instead of depending
on an outside firm. Despite the recent creation of an inspection unit, GCDB's
system of internal control remains weak. Its accounting system, poorly
designed initially, is now overburdened and needs a major rehabilitation.
27.      Operations.  Commercial transactions represent 75 percent of GCDB's
activities and 90 percent of its revenues, while term lending is limited to
25 percent of outstanding credit. All of GCDB's medium- and long-term lend-
ing is done through a Development Fund, an account clearly separated from its
other operations.  The Fund's resources include specific appropriations from
profits (D 300,000) and borrowings from the central bank (D 4.1 million),
Government entities (D 2.2 million), and eventually external sources. Most of
the resources allocated to the Fund are tied to specific projects sponsored by
Government. As of June 30, 1977, there were 103 development loans outstanding
but four of them represented 88 percent of the D 7.3 million outstanding.
These major loans, although having difficulties, are guaranteed by the Govern-
ment and only 3.3 percent of the term portfolio is affected by arrears. The
overall level of provisions against doubtful loans on both commercial and
development loans (6.5 percent of GCDB's total outstanding portfolio) is con-
sidered adequate by the auditors.
28.      Financial Performance.  GCDB has grown rapidly in its five-year
existence and its assets reached D 40 million as of June 30, 1977. Its
financial position is sound: as of June 30, 1977, the total debt/equity
ratio including guarantees was 14:1 and the term debt/equity ratio was 2:1.
Its profits have been substantial, and represented 24 percent of GCDB's
average equity in 1977.



- 9 -
29.      Prospects.  Development lending is restricted to GCDB's own funds
and resources available to the Development Fund. Since most domestic re-
sources have been earmarked for a few specific projects sponsored by the
Government, GCDB has been unable to satisfy the growing demand for devel-
opment loans. Moreover, rmany entrepreneurs, aware of the shortage of term
resources, have not bothered to apply for loans.
30.      Based on its present pipeline of projects, GCDB is expected to
approve D 3 million in development loans in 1978, with approvals growing at
about 10 percent per year thereafter up to 1982. Financial forecasts show
that internally generated funds and the proposed IDA Credit will be sufficient
to meet the demand for development lending up to about mid-1980 when new
borrowings and additional equity would be needed. GCDB's financial position
is expected to remain sound throughout the forecast period with a term-debt/
equity ratio of 2.5:1 and a total debt/equity ratio of 12:1. Based upon
conservative assumptions which anticipate a higher cost of funds, increased
provisions and expenses, and modest foreign exchange earnings, profits should
remain stable.
IV. THE PROJECT
Project History and Objectives
31.      The proposed project was first identified by a reconnaissance mission
in December 1976 which was seeking a multi-sectoral approach through a single
intermediary to meet the credit needs of the economy; the Gambia Commercial
and Development Bank was appraised in November 1977. Negotiations were held
in Washington from April 21 to April 25, 1978. The Gambian delegation was led
by Mr. Housainou M. M. N'jai, Managing Director of GCDB. The Staff Appraisal
Report No. 1947-GM is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
Annex III of this report provides supplementary project data. The map of The
Gambia (No. 11922R) is also attached.
32.      The project is designed to support The Gambia's efforts in diver-
sifying its economic base by meeting the credit needs of rural and urban
entrepreneurs. The project's objectives are to provide needed term resources
and to build up GCDB as a viable financial intermediary. The project will
also offer the opportunity to advise Government on outstanding issues and
policies affecting the financial system, including interest rates and resource
allocation.
33.      To achieve these objectives, the project comprises the following
components: Credit to artisans and entrepreneurs, technical assistance
to GCDB, construction of GCDB's new office building, and a study of housing
needs and financing.
Project Description
34.      The Line of Credit.  US$2 million of the IDA Credit proceeds would be
passed on to GCDB as a line of credit to finance economically and financially



- 10 -
sound investments. GCDB is expected to finance about 80 subprojects repre-
senting a total investment of $2.8 million. At least US$400,000 of the line
of credit would benefit small-scale, labor-intensive enterprises which have
total assets below US$55,000, includinb  hie proposed iLIvesLmen. (maximumu loan
size of US$50,000), and which create jobs at a cost below US$4,000. Typical
small-scale investments would include traditional crafts, wood and metal work-
ing, bakeries, tailoring, repairs and maintenance activities. US$600,000 of
the line of credit would assist medium-scale industries defined as enterprises
requiring long-term credit from US$50,000 up to GCDB's exposure limit (about
US$250,000). Medium-scale investments would typically be in the areas of
light manufacturing, construction and services. The balance of US$1 million
would finance investments in agriculture and agro-industries. To complement
the credit component of the Rural Development Project, GCDB, under this
project, would only finance areas outside groundnut production (fruits and
vegetables, poultry, rice, livestock), ancillary agricultural services (equip-
ment, transport and storage) and processing of agricultural products (rice
milling, fruit, vegetable and meat processing). Farmers who are not coopera-
tive members or who are investing in activities outside groundnut production
could therefore receive term credit. (Schedules I and 2 to the Development
Credit Agreement.)
35.       IDA would refinance direct foreign costs and the indirect foreign
cost of locally procured goods (the latter being estimated at 70 percent of
local expenditures) and, for small-scale subprojects, the entire amount of
GCDB's subloans (Schedule 2 of the Development Credit Agreement). On average,
IDA's contribution would represent 70 percent of total subproject costs. The
terms of GCDB's subloans would range from 2 to 15 years, with an average
of 5 years expected for agriculture and SSE investments, and 8 years for
medium-scale investments (Section 2.02(e) of the Project Agreement). SSE
subprojects are expected to average US$10,000; agro-industrial and medium-
scale subprojects, US$300,000; and agricultural subprojects, US$20,000. An
interest rate of 11 percent would be charged to all final borrowers (Section
3.09(a) of the Project Agreement). This rate represents a 3 percent increase
over GCDB's present rate and is slightly above the current inflation rate
estimated at 9 percent for 1977. The first five subprojects in each category
would be submitted to IDA's approval. A free limit of US$50,000 has been
agreed for subsequent individual sub-loans, with an aggregate free limit of
US$600,000 (Section 2.02(b) of the Development Credit Agreement). GCDB would
calculate financial rates of return for all subprojects; for import-substitu-
tion subprojects, GCDB would also calculate economic rates of return (Section
2.02(b) of the Project Agreement).
36.      The line of credit would be on-lent by the Government to GCDB, at
the prevailing World Bank rate, for eighteen years including three years of
grace. No commitment fee would be charged GCDB and repayment would be on a
fixed amortization schedule of equal, semi-annual payments of principal and
interest (Section 3.01(b) of the Development Credit Agreement). A fixed
amortization schedule is justified to provide GCDB with increased resources
and to ease the administrative burden of frequent schedule readjustments. The
foreign exchange risk on the line of credit to GCDB would be borne by the
Government (Section 3.03 of the Development Credit Agreement). GCDB would



- 11 -
limit its term borrowing to four times its paid-in share capital and free
reserves (Section 3.06 of the Project Agreement).
37.      Technical Assistance to GCDB.  Accounting specialists would be
engaged for twelve man-months to rehabilitate GCDB's accounting system. The
new system would be implemented by a financial advisor for two man-years.
To equip GCDB with proper appraisal and follow-up procedures for its develop-
ment loans, the project would finance for three years a technical advisor
trained in engineering and experienced in financial analysis. Suitable
counterparts would be hired by GCDB.  To complement these activities, the
project also includes an allocation of US$50,000 to sponsor internal staff
training and courses abroad. To complete the institution building effort,
GCDB will supplement its present by-laws with a policy statement governing
its development lending. It will also improve its procedures by adopting
a standard loan agreement by September 30, 1978 (Section 2.11(a) of the
Project Agreement) and by hi.ring a lawyer as and when necessary (Section
2.01(b) of the Project Agreement). The technical advisor would be hired by
March 31, 1979, and two suitable counterparts would be hired by June 30, 1979
(Schedule 2 of the Development Credit Agreement). Total cost of this com-
ponent is US$510,000. IDA's contribution towards foreign costs of technical
assistance (US$440,000) would be passed on to GCDB as a grant. The adoption
of a policy statement will be a condition of credit effectiveness (Section
5.01(c) of the Development Credit Agreement).
38.      Construction of GCDB's Office Building.  The inadequacy of its
present quarters and the lack of office space in Banjul justify GCDB's
decision to build new offices. Preliminary drawings call for a building of
30,000 square feet at a cost per square foot of D 83 (including contingencies)
for a total cost of about D 2.5 million (US$1.1 million). The construction
component of the proposed project of $500,000 would be sufficient to complete
GCDB's financing plan and would represent 60 percent of the foreign exchange
required for the building. Funds for this component would be on-lent by the
Goverment at standard Bank terms as part of the line of credit to GCDB.
Design standards and costs as well as the final contract will be subject to
IDA approval and international competitive bidding will be requested (Section
2.03 of the Project Agreement).
39.      Study of Housing Needs and Financing.  The project provides eight
man-months of short-term consultants to study housing needs in The Gambia.
Consultants will be responsible for evaluating potential demand for housing
credit, will advise Government on suitable housing policies, review alter-
native means of financing, and advise GCDB on necessary credit mechanisms.
The housing study, being of broad interest, will be carried out by the
Ministry of Economic Planning and Industrial Development (MEPID). Total cost
of the study is estimated to be US$73,000; the Credit would finance foreign
costs and Government local costs (transport, subsistence). (Section 3.01(e)
of the Credit Agreement.)



- 12 -
Project Costs and Financing
40.      The project will cost US$4.5 million, inclusive of taxes (US$0.5
million), of which foreign costs would be US$3.3 million. The proposed IDA
credit of US$3 million would cover 90 percent of total foreign costs and
would correspond to 75 percent of project costs, net of taxes.
Project Implementation
41.      GCDB, the prime agency for project implementation, will coordinate
with IBAS, the Ministry of Economic Planning and Industrial Development and
the Ministry of Agriculture to identify, appraise and supervise subprojects
in their respective fields.
42.      Monitoring.  GCDB would submit quarterly operational and financial
reports, annual reports and audits. In addition, GCDB would furnish informa-
tion on staff training and will keep IDA informed of the status of its co-
ordination with the other organizations. IDA will approve the qualifications,
terms and conditions of employment of advisors and short-term consultants
financed under the project. Provision has been made to finance five man-years
of advisors and 20 man-months of short-term consultants, estimated at an
average cost of US$6,660 per man-month including US$1,035 per man-month for
travel and subsistence.
43.      Procurement and Disbursement.  The purchase of equipment and goods
under the line of credit is not suitable for international competitive bidding,
given the nature and small size of subprojects to be financed. Subborrowers
are expected to follow local procurement procedures which are adequate to
ensure that goods and services are suitable and reasonably priced. GCDB will
submit the construction of its office building to international competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines, and the Gambian contractors
are eligible for a 7-1/2 percent margin of preference for bid evaluation.
GCDB would follow usual DFC procedures for disbursements under the line of
credit. Disbursement for the construction component will be prorated to
work in progress. Government will submit to IDA quarterly documented with-
drawal requests for the technical assistance and consultant components.
Disbursements will be spread over four years (FY79-FY82).
Benefits and Justification
44.      The project is expected to yield the following benefits:
a.  Productive Investments.  The implementation of about 80 economi-
cally and financially viable subprojects, representing an investment of US$2.8
million in agriculture and industry, will help to develop new activities and
will reduce the country's dependence on groundnut production.
b. Employment Creation. The line of credit is expected to create
700 jobs at an average cost per job of US$4000; two hundred of these jobs
will be in small-scale enterprises where the average cost per job is expected
to be US$2,200.



- 13 -
c. Institution Building. The institutional improvements in GCDB to
be achieved under the project such as better trained staff, improved organi-
zation and control, adoption of sound financial, legal and operational policies
as well as improved physical facilities will increase GCDB's overall efficiency
and the quality of its investments.
d. SSE Assistance. By making credit available to SSE, the project
will complement IBAS' efforts to upgrade local artisans and entrepreneurs
thereby contributing to increased productivity and improved technical and
management skills.
45.      Risks.  The small size of the Gambian market, the seasonal variations
in consumers' income and the vulnerability of the economy to groundnut prices
and yield fluctuations are not conducive to private investment and there is
the risk that investments may not materialize as quickly as expected. GCDB's
development lending is expected to increase at about 10% per year. This is a
realistic growth rate, given GCDB's present pipeline of projects. Moreover,
IBAS is expected to generate a sufficient number of small-scale investments
and the strengthened technical ability within GCDB should help the promotion
of viable medium-scale inv,estments. These investments will help to diversify
GCDB's portfolio which, up to now, has been concentrated in a few enterprises.
46.      The project's success will also be dependent on effective coordi-
nation among the various agencies involved:  IBAS, the Ministry of Economic
Planning and Industrial Development and the Ministry of Agriculture. GCDB
will have to rely in part on their staff for technical support in areas
where it is not practicable for GCDB to develop its own expertise. In the
past, however, GCDB has developed good working relationships with these
agencies and cooperation is likely to continue on the same basis. Further-
more, both IBAS and the Ministry of Agriculture's extension services are
being strengthened under separate internationally financed projects. GCDB
will therefore benefit from these improvements.
PART V: LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
47.      The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of The
Gambia and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Associa-
tion and Gambia Commercial and Development Bank, the Recommendation of the
Committee provided in Article V, Section I (d) of the Articles of Agreement
of the Association and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed
credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
48.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Annex III, Section
III. The special condition of effectiveness is the adoption of a policy
statement satisfactory to the Association governing GCDB's lending for
development purposes.

49.      I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI: RECOMMENDATION
50.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.

B.   Projects in Execution**
Cr. No. 187   Banjul (formerly Bathurst) Port Project; US$2.1 million Credit
of May 26, 1970; Effective Date: August 14, 1970; Fully
disbursed.
Supplementary Credit of US$2.4 million of April 1, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
This project consists mainly of the replacement of an old berth
and the repair of an existing wharf. It also provides for purchase of a
dredger and other equipment, and for engineering and consulting services.
The project experienced a cost overrun on civil works, explained
by the fact that (a) appraisal was based on preliminary engineering; in the
course of completing final engineering, quantities needed had to be increased;
and (b) there was a sharp increase in the cost of building material between
the time of appraisal and tenders.
On March 26, 1974, the Board approved a supplementary IDA Credit of
US$2.4 million to finance the cost overrun. Total project cost had increased
from US$2.4 million to US$5.3 million; correspondingly, IDA financing has
increased from US$2.1 million to US$4.5 million.
The project has been progressing satisfactorily; however, the
closing date has been postponed twice from December 31, 1975, to December 31,
1976, and then to December, 1977 to enable construction of additional paving
at Ocean Berth. The project is now completed.
Cr. No. 333   Agricultural Development Project; US$1.3 million Credit of
September 29, 1972; Effective Date: April 20, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
The project has developed 1,961 acres of irrigated rice production
along the Gambia River out of 3,000 acres forecast at the time of appraisal.
The reduction was necessary in order to keep the project within the limits of
the financing available in the face of rapidly increasing costs brought on by
high inflation worldwide in the mid-70s. Despite the reduction in acreage,
the project, which is completed, enjoyed an acceptable rate of return and
provides for 12% of the annual consumption of rice in the Gambia.
**   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution and in particular, to report
any problems which are being encountered and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

ANNEX II
Cr. No. 602   Infrastructure and Tourism Project; US$4.0 million Credit of
January 12, 1976; Effective Date: December 16, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
The project would provide: tourism infrastructure, including access
and secondary roads in the tourism area, extension of telecommunications
facilities, sewerage services in the resort sites, market and food storage
facilities, and a hotel training school; public utilities development, in-
cluding expansion and improvement of the electric power and water supply
systems in the Banjul/Kombo/St. Mary area, equipment to convert existing
diesel engines of electricity generators to use heavy fuel oil and construc-
tion of heavy fuel oil supply and storage facilities; a program to promote
tourism investment and three studies, one on the socio-economic impact of
tourism, one on the feasibility of using groundnut shells to generate electri-
city and one on the management and tariffs of the Gambia Utilities Corporation;
and technical assistance to strengthen the Gambia Utilities Corporation (GUC).
The implementation of the project has been hampered by a number of issues.
Detailed studies undertaken subsequent to appraisal have proven that the
sewerage system as originally designed was too costly and that the food and
storage component was not: economical. Furthermore, GUC's financial situation
had progressively deteriorated. In addition, the public sector's financial
exposure in the hotel indlustry had reached worrisome levels due to the Govern-
ment's inordinate participation in hotel projects through direct investments
and loan guarantees. These issues are in the process of being resolved: the
Government has agreed on a revised sewerage system which could be constructed
within the original estimate, as well as on the replacement of the food
storage and marketing component with a pilot horticultural scheme intended to
provide fresh vegetables for tourist consumption; GUC has undertaken to adopt
financial and organizational measures to improve its financial situation.
Finally, the Government laas decided to slow down approval of new loans or
guarantees for hotel investment and has hired a hotel investment advisor.
Cr. No. 644   Rural Development Project:  US$4.1 Million Credit of July 19,
1976; Effective Date: November 16, 1976; Closing Date:
September 30, 1981.
The project provides: a project coordinating unit; housing,
offices, a training center and visual aids center for extension workers;
vaccines, drugs, equipment, transport, field staff training for the improve-
ment of animal health campaigns; water and stock routes, cattle markets,
holding grounds and a pilot cattle fattening program; credit in kind to
farmers, irrigated and upland agronomic research; a seed multiplication
unit, produce markets and extraction roads; a pilot functional numeracy
program; and consultancies and studies. The project is progressing satis-
factorily.
