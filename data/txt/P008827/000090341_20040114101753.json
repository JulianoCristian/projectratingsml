The lessons learned\n            indicate that reducing the time needed for careful\n            preparation and increasing the size of the loan for\n            project-external political factors was a decision that put\n            the project at risk from the outset and was to a large and\n            critical extent responsible for the factors that prevented\n            the operation from attaining its objectives in terms of both\n            development outcome and project output. As it was, the\n            project was too large and too ambition in its objectives for\n            the then context of Russia. A smaller pilot-operation type\n            project with more modest objectives and a shorter duration\n            would have had significantly better prospects of successful\n            completion and achievement of outcome. Even though it was\n            clear from an early point onward that the project would\n            achieve neither its objectives nor output and disbursement\n            targets, supervision efforts were primarily directed at\n            keeping the project going or exploring alternative ways to\n            increase disbursements. The resources spent on these efforts\n            could have been more profitably used in the preparation of\n            new operations responding to the actual needs of the sector.\n            By discounting the problems of demand, especially given the\n            then existing social and economic context of Russia, was a\n            serious mistake. While not a foregone conclusion in that\n            environment, a more balanced approach would probably have\n            had better prospects of having a successful and lasting\n            policy impact. While attractive, innovative and seemingly\n            the most efficient solution for implementation management at\n            the time of project preparation, the 'General\n            Consultant' became a costly legacy and source of\n            possible conflicts of interest."}, "docdt": "2004-01-12T00:00:00Z"}
