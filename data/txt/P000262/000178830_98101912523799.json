"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The main objectives of this project are\n            to further improve the Ministry of Public Work's\n            (MTPTU) maintenance operations, to provide better access to\n            rural areas and to strengthen MTPTU's institutional\n            capacity. Inadequate maintenance budget allocations and lack\n            of sufficiently qualified administrative, technical and\n            managerial personnel have caused national and secondary\n            roads to begin to deteriorate. The proposed project will\n            help overcome this situation by financing: (i) the renewal\n            of the maintenance equipment fleet; (ii) the construction of\n            workshops and office buildings; (iii) the incremental cost\n            of fuel, spare parts and materials for routine maintenance;\n            (iv) the costs of fuel, spare parts and materials for the\n            periodic maintenance of about 450 km of gravel roads; (v)\n            the rehabilitation of about 280 km of gravel roads; (vi) the\n            resealing of about 320 km of paved roads; (vii) the\n            construction and initial maintenance of about 1,640 km of\n            new and existing feeder roads; and (viii) technical\n            assistance, consultants, training and scholarships to help\n            overcome personnel constraints."}, "docdt": "1981-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
