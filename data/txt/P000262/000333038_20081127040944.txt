                      Fourth Hinhway Project (Credit 1164-UV)


                      Attached is the "Project Completion Report on Burkina Faso                       -- Fourth
       Highway Project (Credit 1164-W)" prepared by the Africa Regional Office.                                 No
       Part I1 was prepared by the Borrower.

                      The Credit (USS46.0 million of June 1981) was to improve road
       maintenance capacity,to finance overdue periodic maintenance works, to construct
       and maintain rural roads, and to help develop the domestic construction industry.

                      Repeated changes of Government obliged project staff to work with
       constantly changing and increasingly difficult interlocutors. Nevertheless                               --
       and although several components were substantially restructured and project
       completion was delayed two and a half years, until July 1988 -- physical output
       was substantial, probably of the order of 85% as a weighted average.
       Nevertheless, the prime objective of this repeater project was institution
       building, and it was not met; many related covenants were not complied with.
       Overall, the outcome is rated as unsatisfactory,its sustainability as uncertain,
       and its impact on institutional development as negligible.

                      The PCR states forthrightly that institution-building efforts were
       thrown into disarray. On the other hand, the PCR makes no explicit reference to
       the 1984 audit on the Rural Roads Project (Credit 579-UV) which discussed at
       length     the    principal    factors   (limited              resources,        centralization         and
       decentralization, desirability of simple project design, donor coordination,
       choice of appropriate technology for construction and maintenance of rural
       roads), that had a deleterious impact on this project as well.

                      The project.r::sy be audited along with the follow-on Transport Sector
       Project.

                                      EVALUATION SUMMARY




 1.           The project was conceived as the first phase of a longer term institution building and
 maintenanceprogram. It was to assistthe Governmentto improveinstitutionalcapacity for the maintenance
 of the road network; to meet the backlog of periodic maintenance on the most important sections of
 itspaved and unpaved road network; and to improve theaccessibilityof rural areasfor which agricultural
 development projects were being implemented or planned. Another objective was to help develop
 the domestic construction industry (para 3.01).

 Im~lementationExperience

 2.           The project was originally scheduled to be carried out during the period of June 1981
 to December 1985. However, during that time the country underwent three coups d'dtat that resulted
 in a slowdown of all project implementation. The highway project was only roughly half completed
 and maintenance reorganhtion had encountered serious difficulties. The number of regional directorates
 was doubled over that originally planned without consultation with IDA (para 4.02). This threw project
 institutionbuilding efforts into disarray and resulted in drastically reduced project output. Equipment
 was diverted to non-project construction works, at times leaving only about half of it for road maintenance.
The February 1986 supervision mission blamed political interference for most of the diff~culties,
exacerbated by frequent changes in Government personnel (para 5.02).

3.            The project was substantiallycompleted in July 1988at the beginning of the rainy season.
The final audit was carried out in late 1988 (para 5.03).

Results

4.           The physical targets of the project were substantially achieved althoughprogress was delayed
by diversion of equipment and frequent reorganizations of the Ministry of Public Works, Transport
and Urbanism @4TPTU).Lessprogress was made on the institutionalsidebecauseof frequent government
reorganizations (paras 6.01 and 6.02).

5.           Considering the many setbacks the project suffered during several coups in Burkina Faso
in the early 1980s, the results achieved are satisfactory. Project implementation was reasonably good
under difficult circumstances of domestic turmoil which prevailed during most of the executing period.

6.           Theproject's economic rate of return (ERR),originally estimated at 60 percent, has been
reevaluated at 25 percent (para 6.13).

7.           Coordinationbetween IDA and its major codonor was close(para 8.03). IDA'S relations
with the Borrower were reasonably good in light of the problems which arose (paras 8.01, 8.02 and
8.03).

Sustainability

8.           Theproject isconsideredsustainableprovided thatanumber of reforms in work execution
are introduced, and a follow-up transport sector project including a significantly redesigned road
maintenance component was approved by IDA on February 18, 1992. (para. 7.01)


Findings and Lessons Learned

9.          Theprojectwasthoroughlypreparedand supervised. Lessonslearnedinclude(para8.05):

      (a)    close coordination between IDA and its codonor greatly facilitated progress;

      (b)   thorough supervision is essential to maintaining progress especially during periods of
             instability;

      (c)    a project design featuring decentralization which depends on results of a simultaneous
            training program to produce additional qualified personnel needed is a difficult task;

      (d)   forceaccountroad constructionand maintenancebrigadesarehandicapped by bureaucratic
            processes to maintain their operational capacity, are highly vulnerableto political whims
            when they are operating properly, use the scarce management resources of developing
            countries ineficiently, and often lead to resource wastage;

      (e)   themobilizationof adequatemanagement and technical skillsatallthelevelsfromplanning
            to executionrequiresproper compensation. This can best be done by the private sector;
             and

      (f)   much remains to be done to developproper geometric and quality standardsas a function
            of differenttraffic levels and to have governmentspromoteadherence thereto in an effort
            to husband scarce resources.

2.01         At the time the project was prepared, the primary responsibility for transport planning
and coordiion in Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso) rested with the M          i of PublicWorks, Transport,
and Urbanism (MTPTU). The General Directorate of Public Works (DGTP) was responsible for the
planning, construction and maintenance of roads, while the General Directorate of Transport (DGT)
was responsible for planning and supervision of the road transport industry, railways, and aviation.
The investmentproposals made by the MTPTU were submittedtothe Ministryof Planningfor selection
and inclusion in five-year development plans. The Ministry of Finance established road user taxes
and specified financial ceilings for the sector.

2.02         Investmentsin thetransport sectorhad been financed almostexclusivelyby foreign donors,
with Government involvementlimited initiallyto record-keeping. In 1976,however, the Government
began to become involved in the planning of these investments through the Bureau of Planning and
Programming (BPP), which was established with UNDP financing and IDA technical supervision.
The technical assistants provided under the UNDP program trained personnel in the BPP to analyze
transport investments and to establish priorities. Their work focussed on reviewing feasibility studies
prepared by consultants and on establishing feeder road construction and rehabilitation programs.

2.03         Up to the time of appraisal, the Bank Group had been involved in one railway and three
highway projects to improve and develop Burkina Faso's transport infrastructure. The three highway
projects were: the First HighwayProject (Cr. 316-W, US$2.8 million, 1972, supplementedby US$1.35
million, 1974), the Rural Roads Project (Cr. 579-UV, US$7.5 million, 1975)and the Third Highway
Project (Cr. 653-UV, US$20.0 million, 1976, supplementedby US$3.5 million in 1979). The First
Highway Project complemented the West Volta Cotton Project (Cr. 706-UV) by upgrading to gravel
standards a 70-km road serving the project. The Second Project provided for the improvement of
1,200 kmof rural roads and maintenanceof 2,100 km of existing rural roads. The Third Project called
forthepavingof theBanfora-BoboDioulasso-Hounderoad(183km),equipmentfor axleweightcontrol,
technical assistance, and a feasibility study and detailed engineering of the Ouagadougou-Kaya-Dori
road (260 km). It also provided for a highway maintenance study carried out by consultants who drew
up a four-year maintenance program which formed the basis of the road maintenance component of
theFourthHighway Project. Besidesthesespecific road projects, fiveIDAagricultural projects included
road components.

2.04          By 1981,maintenanceof national roadshad steadilyand seriouslydeterioratedsince 1972,
mainly due to inadequate budget allocations. MTPTU's annual budget requests were cut by as much
as two-thirds due to financial constraints. Some 60 percent of the reduced allocations were needed
to cover staffsalaries, leaving insufficientamounts for materials, fuel, spareparts and equipmentrenewal.
Theshortageoffundswasparticularlyacuteasconcernsequipment: thefleetwascompletely inadequate
and badly in need of renewal.

2.05          Maintenanceofdepartmentalandregionalroadswasstartedunder theRuralRoadsProject.
Thishad not experienced the same budgetary and equipmentdifficultiesas the maintenance of national
roads, sincenew equipment and somemaintenance operating costs were being financedunder the project.
Maintenance of most unclassifiedroads wasofficially theresponsibilityofthe local communitiesserved
by theroad, butsincelocalcommunitieshad neithertheexperiencenorthe meanstoorganizeanefficient
road maintenance operation, most of these roads had not been maintained at all.

2.06         Duringtheexecutionofthefirstthreeprojects,variousissueshad emerged andwere addressed
by this project as noted in the Staff Appraisal Report:

      (a)    Shortageof m ~ ~ 7 p e r s oin~thees le a . An appropriatemanagement policy in
             the sector should: i) establish strict priorities for investments in the sector; ii) limit such
             investments to the availability of recurrent cost funds necessary to maintain the capital
             assets acquired; and iii) use in a rational and efficient manner the limited funds allocated
             to cover recurrent costs. TheBPP intheMTPTU had themandateto evaluateandprogram
             investments in the sector. Technical assistance was provided under the project to train
             administrative and accountingpersonnel to use the funds allocated to the recurrent cost
             budget of the DGTP more efficiently;

      (b)    Shortage of technical mid-level ~ersonnelto oDerate and maintain road maintenancg
             mui~rnenl.Long before the project was approved, the need for more trained mechanics
             and machine operators was recognized both by Government and IDA. In anticipation
             of theneed to establish viableroad maintenance institutions,the Second EducationProject
             (Cr. 956-UV, US$14.0 million, 1980)included a component for upgrading the Center
             for Technical Training in Public Works (CFPTP)for the training of road maintenance
             personnel; and

      (c)    Lack of funds to maintain an extensive road network. As the economy was based on
             subsistenceagricultureand characterizedby slowoverallgrowth, trafficwasconcentrated
             onalimitednumberof main trunkand secondaryroadslinkingthefew centersof economic
             andpoliticalactivity. Ruraldevelopmentprojectscoveringhundredsofvillagesthroughout
             the country required access roads if significant changes in agricultural production were
             tobebrought about. Over the 1974-81period, the rural road network had been expanded
             but again, adequateprovisionsfor maintenancehad not been made. Theproject included
             a component to evaluate the potential for developing a system of cantonnage whereby
             rural populationswhich benefit from the constructionof low volume accessroads in their
             areado most of the maintenance. MTPTU would remain responsiblefor the maintenance
             of higher volume roads.

3.    Proiect Obiectives and Descri~tion

3.01         Proiect Ob-iective. The project was designed as the first phase of a long-term institution
building and maintenance program. It was to assist the Governmentto improve its institutionalcapacity
for the maintenance of the road network; to meet the backlog of periodic maintenance on the most
important sections of its paved and unpaved road network; and to improve the accessibility of rural
areasfor which agriculturaldevelopmentprojects were being implemented or planned. Another objective
was to help develop the domestic construction industry.

3.02         Proiect Description. To meet the above objectives, the project consisted of:

      (a)    A four-year (1982-85) program of road maintenance which included:

             (0      acquisition of road maintenance equipment;

             (ii)    constructing, equipping and furnishing office buildings and stockrooms in four
                     regions and equipping one central and three regional workshops;

             (iii)   incremental costs of routine maintenance for the classified road network;

             (iv)    operatingcostsforperiodicmaintenance of about 450km ofgravel roadsby force
                     account;

             (v)     rehabilitation of about 280 km of gravel roads by contractor; and

             (vi)    resealing of about 320 km of paved roads by contract.

      (b)    A three-year program for the construction and initial maintenance of about 1,640 krn of
             feeder roads which included:

             6)      equipment and spare parts to replace or complement existing equipment of the
                     Feeder Roads Units;

             (ii)    provision of spare parts, materials and supplies; and

             (iii)   construction of small drainage structures by local contractors.

      (c)    Consulting services for:

             (i)     technical assistance and training to DGTP;

             (ii)    supervision of rehabilitation of gravel roads;

             (iii)   design and preparation of tender documents for the CFPTP;

             (iv)    continuation of a Rural Road Impact Studybegun under the Rural Roads Project;

             (v)     implementation of a pilot community-based maintenance scheme; and

              (vi)     technical assistance for the domestic construction industry.

       (d)    Scholarships for road maintenance managerial staff.

4.     Proiect Design and Organization

4.01          After studying DGTP's structure, the consultantshad proposed a gradual reorganization
beginning in 1981. This was accepted by the Governmentand endorsed by IDA with some modifications.
Themain changeto the existingorganizationwassuccessivedecentralizationof maintenanceoperations
as qualified personnel became available. A second change would reallocate responsibilities between
divisions which under the new organization would become directorates. The modified organization
would have under the General Directorateof PublicWorks, a Directoratefor Studiesand New Works
(DETN), a Directoratefor Equipment (DM) and, at first, four regional directorates. DETN would
continueto be responsibleforthe designand supervisionofconstruction. Itwould, in addition, through
aFeeder Roads Unit Studysectionattached to DETN, be responsiblefor theprogramming and supervision
of feeder roads to be improved under the project. DM would be responsible for the procurement,
maintenance and distribution of heavy equipment used by the regional directorates.

4.02         Full decentralizationof maintenanceoperationsand force accountworks was totakeplace
over ten years. Initially, it was intended to create four regional directorateswhich would correspond
totheexistingsubdivisionsinBobo-Dioulasso, Ouagadougou,OuahigouyaandFadaN'Gourma. Additional
equipment, workshops and offices for these four regional directorates would be financed under the
project. Each regional directoratewould have a unit for the maintenance of national roads and a unit
fortheconstructionandmaintenanceoffeederroads. Feeder roadsimprovedunderthisandtheongoing
Rural Roads Project wereto be maintained by these regional Feeder Road Units. Accounts for feeder
road constructionandmaintenancewereto bekeptseparatelyfromthemaintenanceactivitiesonnational
roads. It was expected that the Government would create additionalregional directoratesas qualified
personnel became available, so that each of the country's 12 regions would have its own directorate
by about 1990. In the meantime, the first four regional directorates would be responsible for road
construction and maintenance in neighboring regions.

4.03         The existing BPP was split into its two functions. The planning functions, which also
covered the General Directorate of Transport (DGT), was to be attached to the Ministry's cabinet.
The programming function was to be attached to the DETN where it would remain responsible for
examining the economic feasibility of annual feeder road programs and of other new road projects
to be phased intothe investmentprogram. Duringnegotiations, Governmentagreed thatthe reorganization
as described above would take effect before the end of 1981.

4.04         Totalpublicexpendituresonroad constructionand maintenance amountedto aboutCFAF
20 billion from 1975 to 1980. Of the portion allocated to current expenditures for the maintenance
of national and secondary roads, CFAF 4.2 billion, the Government contributed 3.5 billion or about
83 percent. Theremainingexpendituresonmaintenanceand all new constructionwasforeignfinanced,
mainly by the European Development Fund (EDF), Fonds d'Aide et de Coop6ration(FAC) and IDA.
Some 60 percent of the Government's expenditureswent for salaries of administrative and operating
personnel, with insufficientallocationsremainingfor fuel and spareparts needed for effectivemaintenance.
To improve this situation,the Government agreed to budget allocationsfor salaries, fuels, spareparts
and materials separately. This arrangement was confirmed during negotiations.

4.05            To facilitate the timely availability of funds for the execution of routine maintenance and
force account works, Government proposed to establish a special account in a private bank. The
Government agreed to the above arrangements during negotiations.

4.06            DETN, which was responsible for supervision of all construction, used consulting firms
to assist it in supervising major road projects. However, DETN had the capacityto superviseconstruction
and to control the quality of smaller projects with assistance, where necessary, from the National Road
Laboratory.

4.07            A Rural Roads Impact Study financed under the Rural Roads Project had identified
communities where villagers expressed a willingness to contribute labor towards the maintenance of
roads that were improved under the Rural Roads Project. The project included financing of a pilot
road maintenance project. Under the direction of an experienced consultant, a pilot scheme for labor-
intensiveroad maintenancewastobesetup in onesub-regionto determine, through practical experience,
what type of organization was feasible and what level of remuneration necessary to generate local
involvement in road maintenance. As aworkablesystem developed, a number of local personnel could
be trained to expand itto other regions of the country. Unfortunately, the pilot schemehad to be aborted
as the scheme, which called for local contributions of labor, was not considered feasible under the
conditions brought about by a coup.

4.08            Maintenance of DGTP equipment was the responsibility of DM. Equipment availability
was a low 35 percent, due to a combination of factors: antiquated equipment and lack of qualified
personnel, workshop facilities, tools and spare parts-the latter exacerbated by insufficient funds and
uncoordinated ordering procedures. Theproject financed equipment modernization, spare parts, tools
and workshop facilities. It also provided funds fortechnical assistance fordesigning and implementing
appropriate procurement and inventory procedures and training of mechanics.

4.09            Engineers and higher-level technical staff were to be trained abroad, mainly with the help
of fellowships. TheCFFTPtrained lower-level technicians, road foremen, cost accountants, administrative
personnel, and mechanics. To improveCFPTP's facilities, the SecondEducation Project had financed
the expansion and modernization of the existing training facilities (para 2.06 (b)). But the number
of teachers was inadequate to provide enough trained personnel for DGTP's needs.

4.10            Thehighway andrural road componentsof theproject wereprepared by Bankheadquarters
and RMWA respectively, as separate projects. In 1981, IDA resources had become tight, a coup had
just taken place in Upper Volta, and in the light of budgeting problems, Government and IDA decided
to combine the two operations into a single project. The total cost of the project was estimated at
USs56.7 million of which USS45.0 was in foreign exchange. The credit of USf46 million covered
81 percent of project costs net of taxes. TheNetherlands financed on a parallel basis equipment costing
USs8.0 million or 14percent of project costs on a grant basis. IDA was appointed by the Netherlands
as the administrator of the grant funds.          MTPTU was given overall responsibility for project
implementation.

5.     Proiect Im~lementation

5.01            Credit Signing on Proiect Start-UD. Although the Credit was approved by the Board in
June 1981, it could not be signed until January 1982because of a lack of IDA funds. The Credit did
not become effective until August 1982 because of a delay on the part of the Government in signing

the public debt side letter. However, this did not delay the preparation of documents for equipment
procurement and a start on the reorganization of the MTPTU.

5.02          Im~lementationSchedule. Theprojectwas originallyscheduledtobe completedby December
31, 1985. However, by that date the country had undergone two more coups d'etat that resulted in
a slowdown of all project implementation. The highway project was only roughly half completed
and maintenancereorganization had encountered serious difficulties. The number of regional directorates
was doubled over thatoriginallyplanned withoutconsultationwith IDA (para 4.02). This threw project
institutionbuilding efforts into disarray and resulted in drastically reduced project output. Equipment
was diverted to non-projea constructionworks, attimes leaving only abouthalf of it for road maintenance.
The February 1986supervision mission blamed political interference for the difficulties, exacerbated
by frequent changes in Government personnel.

5.03          The project was substantiallycompleted in July 1988at the beginning of the rainy season.
The final audit was carried out in early 1990.

5.04          Procurement. Procurementof equipment, spareparts technical assistanceand civilworks
proceeded reasonably satisfactorily, but operations were substantially delayed by problems of the
reorganization and lack of local funds. Equipment financed by IDA was procured by ICB.

5.05          Proiect C o s ~ .Total project costs were slightly lower than estimated at appraisal. Table
5(A) shows the appraisal and completion costs, and Table 5(B) shows the sources of financing for
the project.

5.06          Disbursemen& ByJune 1989,aboutUS$0.5 millionremainedundisbursed. SDR395,297.05
were canceled as of November 7, 1989.

5.07          Credit Allocation. The original allocation of Credit proceeds was changed on June 25,
1986and June 26, 1987, as indicated on Table 3(B). The changes mainly reflect increases in spending
on civil works and technical assistance, by the transfer of unallocated funds to these categories.

6.     Proiect ResuIQ

6.01          Proiect Obiectivq. The project, as the first phase of a long-term institutionbuilding and
maintenance program, was only partially successful in achieving its aims especially in developing
institutional capacity, due mainly to a succession of disruptive political and administrative changes
through most of its implenentation period.

6.02          Physical ResulQ. The physical targets were substantially achieved as planned, although
the works were delayed by diversions of equipment in 1985 and 1986to works outside the project,
and by repeated reorganizations of the MTPTU. These complications made it difficult to adhere to
the construction and maintenance program timetables.

6.03          Construction and Eaui~mentof Offices and Worksho~~.The offices and workshops for
the five Regional Directorates of Bobo-Dioulasso, Dedougou, Ouahigouya, Fada, and Ouagadougou
were constructed and equipped, as well as the offices for the Dori, Gaoua and Diapaga District
subdivisions.

6.04          Additional Routine Maintenance. The initial program was modified mainly towards heavier
maintenanceoperations: a large quantityof heavy grading with spot regravelling was executed instead
of larger quantities of light grading (Table 6 (A) and (B)) while the road corrugation control program
that was to be carried outswithdrags towed by agricultural tractors was completedonly in a very small
proportion. The changes in the program were consistentwith a road network in poor initial condition,
difficult to maintain with light interventions. The total value of the routine maintenance operations
that havebeen completed and analyzed remains nonethelessequivalentto the total valueof the interventions
that had been planned, but they were executed over a longer period (Table 6 (F)). The result of the
heavier interventions executed and lower annual expenditures was an improved road network, but to
a lesser extent than had been envisioned.

6.05          Periodic Maintenance of 450 km of Gravel Roads bv Force Account. The program was
increased at the outset of the project to include 846 km of gravel roads. The force account crews had
regravelled 929 km of roads at the end of December 1988(Table 6 (C)), for a total of 1,180,000 cubic
meters of gravel or 1,270 cubic meters per kilometer on average.

6.06          Rehabilitation of 280 km of Earth Roads bv Contractor. Only 55 percent of the earth
road rehabilitation program could be completed, the roads being so deteriorated that they had to be
entirely reconstructed at a much higher unit cost than planned.

6.07          Resealine 320 km of Paved Roads bv Contractor. The work consisted of reconstructing
the road base and the surface dressing on the most heavily travelled third of the planned network at
a cost about equivalent to the resealing that had been planned. The appropriateness of this strategy
has been confirmed by the economic analysis executed with the HDM 111model during the PASECT
preparation. The rest of the roads will be rehabilitated in the same fashion or resealed, according
to traffic and condition, during the follow+n Transport Sector AdjustrnentflnvestmentProgram (Cr.
2332-BUR).

6.08          Cons
              c         i n f 1                t                             . The 164.0 bu program
was reduced to 953 km at the beginning of the project to account for lower-than-planned equipment
availability, and 705km of feeder roads were finallyconstructed (Table6 @)). A very smallproportion
of the feeder roads constructed were part of the three integrated rural development projects. More
importantroads linking rural communitieswere constructedinstead. Theroad standardshave therefore
generally been much higher than those that had been planned. Traffic nonetheless is lower than eight
vehicles per day on 37 percent of the network that has been built and the reduced standard that had
been planned should have been applied for those.

6.09          construction of Culverts hnd Bridges by Force Accounl. One-hundred-thirteen drainage
works varying from 80 cm diameter culverts to small bridges with three 12 meter long spans have
been built by force account following a program that was approved towards the end of the project.
These structures were built on roads regravelled under earlier projects, which ran out of funds for
necessarydrainageworks. Their completion improved some200lanto all weather standard      -a   significant
project achievement not reflected in the ERR calculations.

6.10          Considering the many setbacks the project suffered during several coups in Burkina Faso
in the early 1980s, the results achieved are satisfactory. Project implementationwas reasonably good
under the difficult circumstances of domestic turmoil which prevailed during most of project
imp1ementation.

6.11          Training. Ten people received training as cost accountants under the project. Record
keeping as to status, contracts, disbursements, equipment use, costs, etc. was well done.

6.12          Financial Performancg. The Governmentfrequentlyfailed to providethe local fundsfor
fuel and spare parts, etc. as it had originally committed itself to do. Road Fund allocationswere not
adequatefor maintenance. Theseshortfallswerepartly compensated forby local counterpartfinancing
provided by the Netherlands which covered part of the cost of fuel and parts.

6.13          EconomicAnalvsi~.Theeconomicanalysiswascalculatedwiththeresultsoftheeconomic
analysiscompletedforthePASECTwiththeHDM I11model, andby comparingthoseresultsforworks
of the same type and equivalent traffic. The economic rate of return (ERR) for the project has been
reevaluated to 25 percent (Table6 (G)), down from 60percent in the Appraisal Report. The overall
rate of return is affected by the road standard adopted which was high relative to the traffic on the
roads rehabilitatedby contractor, and more sofor the feeder roads, as well as by the increased quantity
of worksrequired becauseofthecompletedeteriorationof existingroads. Also,traffichas notincreased
as rapidly as expected on most of the roads.



7.01         The project is considered sustainable; a follow-up transport sector project with a sizable
road maintenance component (PASECT) was approved by IDA on February 18, 1992.

8.    Bank Performance

8.01         The project was thoroughly prepared and appraised by headquarters (construction and
maintenancecomponents),andby theRegional Miion inWestAfrica (RMWA)(feederroadcomponent).
Thecomponentswerecombined intoasingleprojectjustbeforenegotiations. Thetwounitssupervised
their components until the Rural Road Section at RMWA was dissolved in 1982 and transferred to
headquarters. The preparation of a separate feeder roads project and a road maintenance project by
RMWA and headquarters units respectively during 1979-80 led to greater than normal number of
preparation missions (Table 4).

8.02          Supervisionwas frequent and at least some of the same staff continued to supervisethe
project until its completion, so continuity was good. In July 1985, an IDA staff member visited the
consultant's headquarters to request changes in the technical assistanceteam. Again, in May 1986,
when itbecameapparentthatproject executionwas in serioustroublebecauseof diversionof equipment
and funds,senior IDA officials visited Burkina Faso to persuadethe Government that unlessperformance
improved, the Credit might be cancelled.

8.03         IDAcooperatedcloselywithitscodonor, theNetherlandsandseveralsupervisionmissions
were staffed by representativesof both agencies.

8.04         Theprojectdesignwasbasedongradualdecentralizationofahighlycentralizedadministration.
When accelerated by Government,this became a high risk operationespecially since it was dependent
on the simultaneous implementation of a training program to produce the staff and skilled workers
needed to run a decentralized operation.

8.05         LessonsLearned. Thelessonslearnedfrom theexecutionof thisprojectarethefollowing:

      (a)   close coordination between IDA and its codonor greatly facilitated progress;

      (b)   thorough supervision is essential to maintaining progress especially during periods of
            instability; '



      (c)   a project design featuring decentralization which depends on results of a simultaneous
            training program to produce additional qualified personnel needed is a difficult task;

      (d)   forceaccountroad constructionand maintenancebrigadesarehandicapped by bureaucratic
            processes to maintain their operational capacity, are highly vulnerable to political whims
            when they are operating properly, use the scarce management resources of developing
            countries inefficiently, and often lead to resource wastage;

      (e)   themobilizationof adequatemanagementandtechnical skillsatallthe levelsfromplanning
            to execution requires proper compensation. This can best be done by the private sector;
            and

      (f)   much remains to be doneto develop proper geometric and quality standardsas a function
            of differenttraffic levels and to have governmentspromote adherencethereto in an effort
            to husband scarce resources.

take a strong stand with Government in insisting on better performance.

10.   Consulting Service

10.01       Theposition of the consultant was made difficult by frequent changes in the MTF'I'U project
team, and at times the consultant provided the only element of stability of the project. When IDA
was not satisfied with the project manager's performance, the consultant responded by making the
requisite changes, and the team performed satisfactorily under sometimes trying conditions.
