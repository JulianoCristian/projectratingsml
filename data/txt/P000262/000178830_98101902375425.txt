FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:      The Republic of Upper Volta
Amount:        Special Drawing Rights 37.7 million (US$46.0 million)
Terms:         Standard
Project
Description:   The main objectives of this project are to further improve
the Ministry of Public Work's (MTPTU) maintenance operations,
to provide better access to rural areas and to strengthen
MTPTU-S institutional capacity. Inadequate maintenance budget
allocations and lack of sufficiently qualified administrative,
technical and managerial personnel have caused national and
secondary roads to begin to deteriorate. The proposed project
will help overcome this situation by financing: (i) the
renewal of the maintenance equipment fleet; (ii) the construc-
tion of workshops and office buildings; (iii) the incremental
costs of fuel, spare parts and materials for routine mainte-
nance; (iv) the costs of fuel, spare parts and materials for
the periodic maintenance of about 450 km of gravel roads;
(v) the rehabilitation of about 280 km of gravel roads;
(vi) the resealing of about 320 km of paved roads; (vii) the
construction and initial maintenance of about 1,640 km of new
and existing feeder roads; and (viii) technical assistance,
consultants, training and scholarships to help overcome
personnel constraints.
Benefits:      Primary beneficiaries of the proposed project would be rural
populations since the major components are complementary
investments to regional rural development projects, e.g.,
Bougouriba. The proposed road maintenance and rehabilitation
would preserve existing capital assets and result in significant
road user savings. The technical assistance components will
lead to the sound administration of a financially viable
maintenance program.
Risks:         The project presents some financial and institutional risks.
If Government s resources are strained to the point where it
fails to provide adequate funds for the road maintenance
budget, the program envisaged under the project could fall
short of its objective and the economic return on the invest-
ment and road rehabilitation, would be lower. Furthermore,
the proposed project will require close coordination between
programming and execution of operations, e.g., the timely
provision of manpower and materials. These risks will be
reduced through annual review and the provision of appropriate
technical assistance.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
REPUBLIC OF UPPER VOLTA FOR THE FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Upper Volta in an amount equivalent
to SDR37.7 million (US$46.0 million) on standard IDA terms to help finance
the Fourth Highway Project. The Kingdom of the Netherlands will provide
US$8.0 million equivalent on grant terms for equipment purchases.
PART I - THE ECONOMY l/
2.        An economic report entitled "Economic Memorandum; Upper Volta"
(2146-UV) was distributed to the Executive Directors on March 14, 1979.
Information from that report, together with information obtained during a
mission in June 1980, is incorporated in the paragraphs which follow. Annex I
contains country data.
Socio-Economic Background
3.        With a per capita GNP of US$180 in 1979, Upper Volta is one of the
poorest African countries and is classified among the 29 "least developed
countries" by the United Nations. The economy is overwhelmingly rural. Total
land area is 274,000 km2, of which 194,000 km2 can be used for agriculture.
The physical constraints to development of the economy include extreme vari-
ability of rainfall, generally poor soils, few exploitable minerals, the
country's landlocked position, and limited potential for industrialization.
4.        The uneven distribution and low level of development of human
resources pose a major additional constraint to the country-s economic
progress. Almost two thirds of the resident population of 5.7 million (1979)
is concentrated on the central plateau, which comprises one third of the
arable land. The pressure of population on the plateau has led to severe
degradation of soils in that area, resulting in persistently low crop yields,
and has given rise to large out-migration to the southwest region and neigh-
boring countries. A four percent annual increase in urbanization also
accounts for part of the internal population movement. Overall population
growth, which has averaged 1.6 percent yearly from 1970-78, is projected to
decline in the 1980s as a result of continued emigration. The level of
skills and basic education in the country is extremely low, as evidenced by
the enrollment of only 22 percent of the relevant age group in primary
school and nonformal rural education centers. Only about 2 percent of
the economically active population, or some 50,000 people are engaged in
salaried employment.
1/   Substantially the same as the President's Report for the Second
Bougouriba Agricultural Development Project (Credit 1097-UV, US$16.0
million, January 1981).



-2-
erformance of National Output
5.        The dominant sectors of the economy, agriculture and livestock,
have been characterized during the past decade by a low average growth of
real output, stagnant productivity and little structural change. The
generally low productivity of the primary sector is indicated by its rela-
tively small contribution to GDP - averaging 40 percent from 1974 to 1978 -
relative to the share of agricultural employment. The sector suffered a
major setback from the prolonged drought which culminated in 1973/74 and
recovery was hampered by a recurrence of bad weather in 1976/77. The real
growth of agricultural output was actually negative from 1974 to 1978.
6.        The secondary and tertiary sectors, which contributed on average
15 percent and 45 percent, respectively, to domestic output over 1974-78
averaged 3 percent annual growth in real output over the same period. The
strongest share of this growth is attributable to government services, which
account for 10 percent of GDP, and to commerce. The greater part of the
industrial and construction sectors' share of national income is still
accounted for by traditional small scale production, although modern manu-
facturing output is expanding rapidly with the aid of fiscal incentives
and protection.
7.        On balance, real GDP has remained almost stationary from 1974-78
and has actually declined in per capita terms. Domestic inflation averaged
12 percent during this period, fueled by foodcrop shortages and high import
prices. The trend in agricultural output markedly improved in 1978 and 1979
following favorable weather and increases in producer prices. Overall,
however, the performance of the economy in the latter half of the 1970s
highlights its extreme vulnerability to climatic variation and to trends
in international inflation.
Balance of Payments
8.        Upper Volta's trade balance has progressively deteriorated over
the past decade as the growth of exports, which consist almost entirely of
agricultural and livestock products, has failed to keep pace with the growth
of imports. Factors enlarging the deficit have included credit expansion and
rising domestic investment, which enhanced the demand for capital goods, and
shortfalls in food production coupled with the rising cost of fuel and related
imports. Until 1975, however, private transfers, especially workers' remit-
tances, and increasing aid flows kept the overall balance of payments in
surplus. From 1975 to 1978, the deficit in the external account widened
annually as the trade gap grew faster than the inflow of official aid. This
trend appears to have been reversed in 1979, largely through an expansion of
official transfers and foreign borrowing.
Public Finance
9.        Prior to 1975, the Government's conservative fiscal policies
enabled it to accumulate large budget surpluses which were reflected in
an accumulated cash balance of CFAF 9.3 billion (US$39.6 million) in 1974.



This pattern of tightly restrained expenditure changed in 1975 with an in-
creased commitment to investment and heightened spending on defense, personnel
and administration. Despite a doubling of government current revenues from
about CFAF 16 billion (US$68.2 million) in 1975 to CFAF 31 billion in 1978
(US$132.1 million), an overall Treasury deficit of at least CFAF 2 billion
(US$8.5 million) has appeared each year since 1976. This imbalance is
estimated to have reached nearly CFAF 7 billion (US$29.8 million) in 1979.
10.       The sources of this increasing deficit in Treasury operations are
multiple: expanded investment expenditure, increases in public sector wages,
extraordinary expenditures associated with the transition to parliamentary
government in 1978, a slowdown in tariff receipts, and weaknesses in tax
collection. The deficit has been financed largely by drawing-down deposits
with the Central Bank, external borrowing (including assistance from the IMF
and commercial banks) and an accumulation of payment arrears to domestic
suppliers. The financial situation of the Treasury is complicated con-
siderably by the lack of coordination between investment planning and the
programming of budgetary expenditures. Moreover, the Government suffers
from generally weak financial controls as evidenced by a proliferation of
extra budgetary accounts in the Treasury, the lack of centralized reporting of
foreign assistance receipts, and an inadequate review of budgetary requests.
Foreign Assistance and Investment
11.       Gross domestic investment, which averages about one quarter of GDP,
is financed almost entirely by foreign official inflows. The planning of
development expenditure has consisted largely of compiling projects for which
donor financing is assured or likely. Although three development plans have
been prepared, the latest covering the 1977/81 period, the process of formu-
lating the investment programs has involved little evaluation and selection of
projects by Government based upon economic criteria and development priori-
ties. In cooperation with the IMF, the Bank has discussed with the Government
needed reforms of the financial management and investment planning process
and a possible technical assistance project to implement them, and intends to
maintain this dialogue with the new Government.
12.       Despite the absence of a distinct investment program, foreign aid to
Upper Volta has continued at a high level, with both commitments and disburse-
ments of official inflows exceeding total budget revenues throughout most of
the 1970s. Most of this aid is on highly concessional terms. The principal
foreign donors are France, the European Development Fund, Canada, the United
States, the Association, and the UNDP.
13.       Foreign capital and technical assistance clearly have a vital role
to play in the development of Upper Volta. In view of the country's poverty
and limited resources, it is appropriate for external lending agencies to
continue to provide assistance on highly concessionary terms and to finance
a high proportion of project costs, including a substantial amount of local
costs.

PART II - WORLD BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN UPPER VOLTA 1/
14.       The Bank Group's commitments in Upper Volta, as of March 31, 1981,
amount to US$145.6 million and cover twenty-one IDA credits and one IFC
investment.  About US$80 million have been disbursed.  The IDA projects
include ten agriculture, four transportation (including one supplementary
credit), two education, two telecommunications, one small and medium scale
enterprise, and one urban development project. The IFC investment is for
plastic production. Of total IDA lending, the agriculture and transporta-
tion sectors account for 56 and 20 percent, respectively. Annex II contains
a summary statement of IDA credits and IFC commitments as of March 31, 1981.
It also includes information on the status of ongoing projects.
15.       A few projects have experienced implementation delays and world
price inflation has led to a number of cost overruns, necessitating supple-
mentary financing (the First Road Project, Credit 316-UV, US$4.1 million,
June 1972) or eliminating lower priority components. Financial control on
some projects has been weak. Future projects will address this issue by the
provision of further technical assistance and training. On the whole, how-
ever, past project performance has been satisfactory given the environmental,
institutional and managerial constraints within the country.
16.       The Bank Group's lending is in line with the Government's priori-
ties as expressed in its Third Development Plan, and will continue to support
the Government's efforts to: (a) increase productivity in agriculture, from
which most of the population derives its livelihood; (b) strengthen basic
infrastructure facilities through road construction and maintenance; (c)
promote training of skilled technicians and managerial staff in view of the
country's limited supply of trained manpower; and (d) mobilize resources
from co-donors.
17.       Future Bank Group lending for Upper Volta will continue to emphasize
assistance to the agriculture and infrastructure sectors. In the transport
sector, the proposed project will further strengthen institutional capacity,
maintenance operations, financial planning and will improve accessibility of
rural areas. A second rail project is envisaged to be executed with the Ivory
Coast. In the agriculture sector, future operations would include second
phase agricultural development projects for both food and cash crops for the
West Volta ORD's of Bobo-Dioulasso and Dedougou, a third Rural Development
Fund Project to carry out small scale projects such as bottomland development,
irrigation and erosion control, and the first phase of a development program
to improve agricultural production and farm incomes in the Koudougou ORD.
Further envisaged projects are, a hydroelectric power, a third education,
third telecommunications and a technical assistance project to strengthen the
Government's investment planning, budgetary programming and control procedures.
1/   Substantially the same as the President's Report for the Second
Bougouriba Agricultural Development Project, (Credit 1097-LW,
US$16.0 million, January 1981).



18.       Upper Volta's external public debt at the end of 1979 amounted
to US$404.8 million (including US$148.4 undisbursed) of which IDA credits
accounted for about 27 percent. The ratio of debt service to exports of
goods and services was 5.8 percent in 1979. Since most loans to Upper Volta
have been made on concessionary terms and a number of donors have recently
converted their outstanding loans into grants, the debt service ratio is not
likely to increase significantly over the next several years.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
The Transport System
19.       Upper Volta has an uncomplicated basic transport infrastructure
with road and rail being by far the most important modes. Presently, the
network consists of about 16,500 km of roads and tracks radiating from the
country's two main cities: Ouagadougou, the capital in the center, and
Bobo-Dioulasso, the commercial center in the southwest. The Regie des
Chemins de Fer Abidjan-Niger (RAN) links the same main cities with the port
of Abidjan in the Ivory Coast. The latter is Upper Volta-s main trading
partner and the railroad carries most of the country's import-export traffic.
Other international access routes include paved roads from Ouagadougou to
the coast through Ghana and Togo and some partly paved roads through Benin.
International airports serviced by Air Afrique and other carriers are located
at Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso. Some 10 additional airstrips are located
at the country's major townships.
20.       Domestic transport is almost exclusively via the country's 16,500
km road network. For administrative purposes, the road system is divided
into two categories: classified roads (about 8,700 km) which are grouped
into national, departmental and regional roads; and unclassified roads
(about 7,800 km) which largely consist only of tracks. Of the classified
road network, only 857 km are paved and about 2,000 km are gravel - surface,
usable during the rainy season. The rest of the classified road network
(more than 5,000 km) are earth surface rural roads and are essentially
dry-weather facilities.
21.       Existing paved and gravel roads, mainly built in the late 1960s
and early 1970s are, however, now beginning to deteriorate because of
increased traffic and insufficient maintenance. Road traffic has grown by
about 8 percent per annum during 1970 to 1975. Sporadic traffic counts in
1978 and 1979 seem to confirm this trend. Around existing large cities,
however, traffic growth has been much greater (10-30 percent).
22.       Considering the level of traffic, the extent of the classified
national road network is adequate. But because of the Government's inter-
ventions in rural areas, new rural roads will have to be constructed and
maintained and existing ones will have to be kept open year around through
improved maintenance.



-6-
'ighway Administration
23.       Within the Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Urban Develop-
ment (MTPTU) the General Directorate of Public Works (DGTP) is responsible for
the planning, design, construction and maintenance of classified roads and
bridges. Local authorities are in charge of the remainder of the network.
In 1976, with the help of UNDP financing and IDA technical supervision as
Executing Agency a Bureau of Planning and Programming (BPP) was established
in DGTP. The UNDP program provides training to Voltaic personnel to analyse
transport investments and to set priorities. DGTP also operates a technical
training school in Ouagadougou (Centre de Formation des Techniciens des
Travaux Publics, CFPTP) and a soil laboratory (Laboratoire du Batiment et
des Travaux Publics).
24.       To further increase DGTP's efficiency and responsiveness, con-
sultants "Bureau Central pour les Equipements d'Outre-Mer" (BCEOM), after
studying DGTP's structure, proposed a gradual decentralization based on
present staffing levels beginning in 1981. The new organization, to take
effect by December 1981, would have under the General Directorate of Public
Works a Directorate for Design and New Works (DETN), a Directorate for Equip-
ment (DM) and four regional directorates, which correspond to the existing
subdivisions in Bobo-Dioulasso, Ouagadougou, Ouahigouya and Fada N'Gourma.
The Government will create more regional directorates as qualified personnel
become available, so that by 1990 each of the country's 12 regions will have
its own directorates. In the meantime the proposed four regional directorates
will be responsible for road maintenance in the neighboring regions. The
existing Bureau for Planning and Programming will be split into its two
functions. The planning function, which also covers the General Directorate
of Transport will be attached to the Ministry's Cabinet. The programming
function will be attached to the DETN where it would remain responsible for
examining the economic feasibility of annual feeder road programs and of other
new road projects to be phased into the investment program. During negotia-
tions, the Government assured the Association, that the proposed reorganiza-
tion would take effect before December 31, 1981 (Section 3.07 of Credit
Agreement).
25.       Even with the reorganization and Government's continuing efforts
to improve the staffing situation through training, DGTP will have to continue
to depend on foreign technical assistance to train civil work specialists,
mechanics and cost accountants. The proposed project thus contains techni-
cal assistance components and scholarships to provide further training for
technical and managerial staff.
Government Expenditure, Financing
26.       Total public expenditures on road construction and maintenance
amounted to about CFAF 20 billion (US$85.2 million) from 1975 to 1980. Of
this CFAF 4.2 billion (US$17.9 million) was allocated to current expenditures
for the maintenance of the classified road network. During this five year
period the Government contributed CFAF 3.5 billion (US$14.9 million) for
maintenance out of its own resources, representing on average, about 3 per-
cent of Government's recurrent budget. Foreign aid financed the difference



- 7 -
in maintenance and all construction expenditures. Major donors are: the
European Development Fund (EDF), Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC),
Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KFW) and IDA.
27.       By 1980, however, Government-s maintenance expenditures had dropped
to 2.4 percent of total national recurrent expenditures. Although existing
road user taxes (mainly import duties on fuel, vehicles and spare parts) more
than cover estimated maintenance expenditures (about 50 percent of the import
taxes on fuel would suffice), severe financial constraints experienced by the
Government over the last few years caused the Ministry of Finance to allocate
less funds (about 50 percent less) to MTPTU for recurrent maintenance expendi-
tures than were necessary to avoid a maintenance backlog--especially on the
national road network which incurs about 75 percent of all road maintenance
expenditures. The amounts actually allocated mainly covered salary related
maintenance expenditures, leaving insufficient funds for other essential
costs, such as, fuel and spare parts to maintain and operate existing equip-
ment efficiently. Equipment availability is presently estimated to be about
35 percent.
28.       On the other hand, maintenance of departmental and regional roads
(largely rural roads) started under the Rural Roads Project (Credit 579-UV,
US$7.5 million, August 1975), has so far not experienced the same budgetary
and equipment difficulties since new equipment and some of the maintenance
operating costs are financed by that project.
29.       Recognizing that most foreign financed road investments were
largely concerned with the construction of the national road network, IDA,
under the Third Highway Project (Credit 653-UV, US$20 million, July 1976),
financed consultants (BCEOM) to prepare a maintenance program covering the
total classified road network, national as well as departmental and regional
roads. The proposed project incorporates the proposed maintenance program and
will help Government to implement it by financing needed technical assistance,
the renewal of the equipment fleet, workshop facilities, and, the incremental
recurrent cost of fuel, spare parts and materials. Furthermore, during
negotiations the Government has agreed that it will (i) follow BCEOM's main-
tenance program; (ii) provide sufficient funds in real terms over the next
four years to meet the projected recurrent maintenance expenditures; (iii)
provide in its maintenance budget seperate budget allocations for salaries,
fuel, spare parts and material; and (iv) annually review the maintenance
budget and program with the Association (Sections 3.01 (b) and (c); and 3.05
of Credit Agreement).
30.       Maintenance of unclassified roads is the responsibility of local
communities served by the road. However, in practice it is neglected due
to the financial and technical difficulties in organizing road maintenance
gangs. Preliminary results of the Rural Roads Impact Study, financed under
the Rural Roads Project have identified communities where villagers expressed
a willingness to contribute labor towards the maintenance of their roads.
The proposed project will include further financing of consultants, who,
within a pilot scheme, will review the possibility of local communities
taking full responsibility for maintenance of roads in their vicinity. The
consultants will recommend appropriate technology, determine the needed
level of remuneration for maintenance gangs and train a number of Voltaics
to promote self-help maintenance in other communities.

Training
31.       Engineers and higher level technicians are trained abroad, mainly
with the help of fellowships. MTPTU's training center, CFPTP, trains lower
level technicians, road overseers, accountants, administrative personnel,
and mechanics. The condition of CFPTP's facilities and the number of teachers
are inadequate to provide enough trained personnel for DGTP's projected needs.
The Second Education Project (Credit 956-UV, US$14.0 million, November 1979)
is therefore financing the expansion and modernization of the existing training
facilities. Furthermore, a study conducted under the Second Education Project
recommended the establishment of a training school for middle and higher level
technicians. The proposed project would finance detailed design of the school
and the preparation of bidding documents. Once the detailed design of the
school is completed, the project could be considered for foreign financing.
The Road Construction Industry
32.       Major road works are generally carried out by foreign firms.  Under
the Third Highway Project (Credit 653-UV, US$20.0 million, July 1976) a domestic
firm participated for the first time on a major road project as a subcontractor
for the Bobo-Dioulasso-Hounde section (80 km) of the Banfora-Hounde road.
Its performance was excellent. The firm is now the main contractor on other bi-
laterally financed road construction projects, but it is so far Upper Volta's
only major domestic construction company. Its key expatriate technical and
management personnel are now slowly being replaced by nationals. The shortage
of qualified and trained personnel is still too acute to permit the emergence
of other civil engineering companies.
33.       There are, however, a large number of small firms in the construc-
tion industry, particularly in the building sector, but only four of these
have been engaged in civil works and their participation was limited to
supply and transport of materials. The Government with the help of a Small
and Medium Enterprise Credit (Credit 759-UV, US$4.0 million, January 1978)
created an office for the promotion of domestic industries (Office de la
Promotion de 1Entreprise Voltaique, OPEV) to provide assistance to Upper
Volta's small scale industry. It consists mainly of training personnel as
well as management assistance to small enterprises. Under the Third Highway
Project, IDA also financed a study to specifically analyze the construction
industry and to recommend a program to help small firms qualify for civil
works. The study is expected to recommend methods to train employees of
existing firms to properly calculate contract prices, prepare bidding
documents and, in general, to improve their management and construction
techniques. The proposed project will provide funds for the implementation
of the assistance program. Furthermore, the gravel road rehabilitation
component of the proposed project will be broken down into small lots to
allow small contractors to compete.
Past Bank Group Assistance
34.       Since 1970, the Bank Group has been involved in one railway and
three highway projects to improve and develop Upper Volta's transport infra-
structure. The first Regional Railway Project (Loan 1490-IVC, US$23.0



- 9 -
million, and Credit 744-UV, US$5.2 million, November 1977) provided for track
improvements, increased capacity and technical assistance to RAN. The First
Highway Project (Credit 316-UV, US$2.8 million, June 1972, supplemented by
US$1.35 million in March 1974), complemented the West Volta Cotton Project
(Credit 225-UV, US$6.2 million, June 1970) by upgrading to gravel standards
about 100 km of roads serving the project. The Rural Roads Project (Credit
579-UV, US$7.5 million, August 1975) provided for the improvement 'of 1,200
km and maintenance of 2,100 km of existing rural roads. The Third Highway
Project (Credit 653-UV, US$20.0 million, July 1976, supplemented by US$3.5
million in 1979) called for the paving of the Banfora-Bobo-Dioulasso-Hounde
road (183 km), equipment for axle weight control, technical assistance, a
highway maintenance study (the basis for the present project) and a feasi-
bility study and detailed engineering of the Ouagadougou-Kaya-Dori road (260
km). Besides these specific transport sector projects some of the agricul-
tural projects also included rural road components.
35.       Project Completion Reports were issued for the West Volta Cotton
Project and for the First Highway Project. An audit report was also issued
on January 9, 1980 for the West Volta Cotton Project, but not yet for the
First Highway Project. The feeder road improvement component of the Cotton
Project was considered to be successful. Overall, the West Volta Cotton
Project was implemented without major problems and its production targets had
been achieved. On the other hand, the First Highway Project experienced
implementation delays due to cost-overruns and completion delays due to the
limited execution capacity, at that time, of the Ministry of Public Works.
The project did not contain any maintenance component.
36.       In the meantime, the Bank has assisted in the strengthening of the
Ministry of Public Works with the Rural Roads Project which started a success-
ful maintenance operation for rural roads. In spite of this success, road
maintenance is still weak in Upper Volta and  must be strengthened. Thus,
considering that the length of Upper Volta's classified road network is
presently adequate, Government's attention now needs to turn to providing
improved maintenance not only for the rural, but more importantly for the
national road network--where a maintenance backlog exists. The proposed
project is designed to help Government implement such a program.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
37.       The proposed project would assist the Government to improve its
institutional capacity for the maintenance of the road network; to meet
the backlog of maintenance on the most important sections of its paved and
unpaved national road network; and to improve the accessibility of rural
areas for which agricultural development projects are being implemented and
planned; it would also help to develop the domestic construction industry.
38.       The project was identified in 1977 following Government's request
for further investment in the transport sector. The project was appraised
in May 1980. Negotiations were held in Washington, D.C. from March 31 to



- 10 -
April 3, 1981; the Voltaic delegation was led by Mr.G.K. Gnoumou, Minister of
Public Works, Transportation and Urbanism. A report entitled "Staff Appraisal
Report - Fourth Highway Project" No. 3256-UV dated May 7, 1981 is being distri-
buted separately to the Executive Directors. Supplementary project data is
contained in Annex III.
Description
39.       The project consists of:
(i) A four year (1982-85) program of road maintenance based on the
maintenance study financed under the Third Highway Project (Credit
653-UV, US$20.0 million, July 1976). To implement this program the
proposed credit would finance: (a) road maintenance equipment; (b)
constructing, and equipping office buildings, workshops and stock-
rooms; (c) incremental costs of routine maintenance; (d) operating
costs of periodic maintenance; (e) rehabilitation of gravel roads;
and (f) resealing of about 320 km of paved roads;
(ii) A three-year program (1982-84) for the construction and initial
maintenance of about 1,640 km of feeder roads. For this purpose the
proposed credit would finance: (a) feeder road maintenance equipment
and spare parts to replace or complement existing equipment of the
Feeder Roads Unit; (b) provision of materials and supplies; and (c)
construction of small drainage structures by local contractors;
(iii) Consulting services; and
(iv) Scholarships for road maintenance managerial staff.
40.       Maintenance Equipment.  The equipment to be procured would mainly
replace worn out equipment. It will be used to establish in each of the
four regional directorates specialized maintenance units e.g., grading unit,
bridge repair unit. Most of the units' equipment is light and the tasks
labor intensive. The heavy equipment will be largely used by the regravelling
brigades for the periodic maintenance of gravel roads.
41.       Workshops and Office Buildings.  The four year maintenance program
contains a detailed description of repairs and new construction of office space
and stockrooms to be executed for the four regional directorates and the three
regional and the central workshops. The work proposed corresponds to DGTP's
needs and is in line with the overall maintenance program.
42.       Routine Maintenance.  Routine maintenance comprises patching of
paved roads, filling potholes and grading gravel roads, cleaning ditches and
drainage structures, repairing bridges, and replacing or setting up road
signals. Under the proposed project 1,750 km would receive normal routine
maintenance and about 5,900 km of roads would receive reduced maintenance
(grading and cleaning of drainage structures only). It is intended that the
length of road receiving normal maintenance will gradually be increased as
additional regional directorates are established.



- 11 -
43.       Periodic Maintenance of Gravel Roads.  Periodic maintenance of
Upper Volta's gravel road network has been neglected thus creating an
important backlog of maintenance. BCEOM-s maintenance study estimates that
a total of about 2,100 km of gravel roads have to be rehabilitated or
regravelled in the near future. About 720 km of these are most urgently in
need of attention if traffic interruptions are to be avoided, and of these
about 450 km will be regravelled by force account. Under the proposed
project, IDA will finance equipment operating cost and materials for these
works, while salaries will be financed by the Government.
44.       Rehabilitation of Gravel Roads.  The remaining 280 km of the 730 km
of gravel roads referred to in the preceding paragraph have already deterio-
rated to such a degree that a more substantial effort, including drainage
improvement and some earthworks, is needed to bring the roads back into an
acceptable condition before routine maintenance can be carried out effectively.
It is proposed that contractors be employed for these works to avoid straining
the Government's implementation capacity and over-extending its equipment
fleet.
45.       Resealing of Paved Roads.  Paved roads normally require resealing
about every seven years to protect the base course from water which seeps in
through surface cracks of an aged and worn out bituminous seal. No such work
has been carried out in Upper Volta since the pavement of its first road (from
Bobo Dioulasso to the Mali border) in 1969. There is a total of about 420 km
of paved roads built between 1969 and 1972 which should be resealed. The
European Development Fund (EDF) is financing the resealing and partial re-
habilitation of road sections totalling some 100 km, on which the deteriora-
tion has progressed to an extent where it endangers and impedes traffic. The
proposed project would finance the resealing of the remaining 320 km. Works
are to be carried out by contractor.
46.       Feeder Roads.  Over the past five to seven year period, about
4,000 km of tracks and trails have been upgraded or maintained under a num-
ber of agricultural and rural development projects. At this stage, it is
important to ensure that feeder roads improved under earlier projects are
adequately maintained, and that future road improvements are carefully
planned to provide optimal support to ongoing agricultural development
schemes.
47.       The proposed project will finance the construction and initial
maintenance of some 1,640 km of feeder roads to minimum all-weather standards.
Of these, 370 km will support the Second Bougouriba Rural Development Project
(Credit 1097-UV, US$16.0 million, March 1981), 330 km the proposed Second West
Volta Agricultural Development Project, and 500 km in the Koudougou area.
The remaining kilometrage will serve communities in the North Center, Yatenga
and Sahel rural development areas.



- 12 -
48.       Particular emphasis will be put on developing the planning and eval-
uation procedures for feeder road improvement and maintenance. Regular consul-
tation and close cooperation between the Feeder Roads Units (FRU) established
under the Rural Roads Projects, the Bureau of Planning and Programming (BPP),
the Regional Development Organizations (ORD) and external financing agencies
will ensure that annual road improvement programs remain responsive to the
needs of rural areas. The Government has agreed to these regular consulta-
tions resulting in road construction programs for the second and third project
years to be submitted to IDA for review not later than October 31, 1982 and
October 31, 1983 respectively (Section 3.06 of Credit Agreement). In addi-
tion, the Government also agreed to keep seperate budget allocation and
accounts for the purpose of feeder road construction and maintenance and to
maintain feeder roads improved under this and the ongoing Rural Roads Project
by the regionalized Feeder Road Units (Sections 4.01(b) and 4.03 of Credit
Agreement).
49.       Consulting Services, Scholarships.  To help government to: (i)
implement and supervise various project components; (ii) assist in prepara-
tion of detailed designs and tender documents, and (iii) help overcome
institutional constraints, the project includes about US$6.7 million for the
financing of consultant services and technical assistance. Furthermore,
to obtain an engineering degree, Upper Volta's students have to go abroad.
Since scholarships financed from bilateral sources are not available in
sufficient quantity and the need for specialized technical personnel becomes
more acute as the Government begins to decentralize road maintenance opera-
tions, the project will finance scholarships for staff (about 12) to special-
ize in management and civil engineering. During negotiations, the Government
has agreed that the consultants would be appointed under terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Association (Section 3.02 of Credit Agreement).
50.       Project Organization and Implementation.  DGTP in MTPTU would have
overall responsibility for project implementation. Responsibilities for
specific project elements will, however, be spread over DGTP-s different
directorates. The Directorate for Equipment (DM), would be responsible for
equipment procurement and the Directorate for Design and New Work, (DETN)
together with the regional directorates for rehabilitation of gravel roads,
resealing of paved roads and improving feeder roads.
51.       Since several project elements (e.g., equipment procurement, regrav-
elling) are the joint responsibility of more than one directorate, a project
coordinator would be appointed within DGTP (Section 3.01 (d) of Credit Agree-
ment). The coordinator would liaise with the various services in the DGTP and
report regularly on the progress of the project. The coordinator would also
be responsible for the preparation of a Project Completion Report within six
months of final disbursement.
52.       Project Costs and Financing.  The cost of the project is estimated
at US$56.7 million net of taxes with a foreign exchange component of US$45.0
million (79 percent). A detailed breakdown of costs is shown in the table of
the Credit and Project Summary. The proposed IDA credit of SDR 37.7 million
(US$46.0 million) would finance 81 percent of project costs net of taxes. The
Kingdom of the Netherlands will co-finance, on a parallel basis, equipment
costs equalling about US$8.0 million or 14 percent of project costs net of



- 13 -
taxes. Upper Volta's contribution, taxes excluded, of US$2.7 million equiva-
lent to 5 percent of project costs would cover about 23 percent of local
costs. US$9.0 million of the proposed IDA credit would meet the remaining
local costs. All foreign exchange costs (US$45.0 million) would be met by the
IDA credit and by the Kingdom of the Netherlands.
53.       Because Upper Volta has difficulty in prefinancing expenditures, an
amount of SDR 0.5 million (US$0.6 million) advanced from the IDA Credit,
would be deposited in a special bank account under the joint control of the
General Director of Public Works and the Chief Accountant of the project. As
with previous Upper Volta projects, disbursements would normally be made in
local currency from the special account and reimbursement made by the Associa-
tion to this account. Should any disbursements be made for expenditures not
allowable under the IDA credit, the Government would redeposit into the
special account the corresponding amount (Section 2.02(b) to (f) of the Credit
Agreement). The opening of the account would be a condition of credit effec-
tiveness (Section 6.01(b) of the Credit Agreement).
54.       Cost estimates are based on prices and quotations obtained in early
1980, updated to early 1981 to reflect 1980 prices increases. Physical
contingencies added to base costs for construction of workshops and office
buildings, the rehabilitation of gravel roads, the resealing of paved roads,
and consultant services are 10 percent. Since the other project elements are
based on an open end guideline program subject to modification, no quantity
contingency has been allowed for them. Base costs plus physical contingencies
were increased overall by some 25 percent to allow for expected price inflation,
calculated at the following annual rates for both the local and foreign com-
ponents: 9 percent in 1981, 8.5 percent in 1982, and 7.5 percent thereafter.
Financial Implications
55.       In constant 1982 dollars, the Government is expected to allocate
for road maintenance about US$5.2 million (CFAF 1.2 billion) in 1982, rising
to US$6.8 million (CFAF 1.4 billion) in 1985. This budgetary allocation
includes (i) costs for routine and periodic maintenance (e.g. equipment
operating costs, salaries, overhead) and (ii) the project induced incremental
costs for routine maintenance minus the Association's cost contribution.
Through the existing fuel and road user taxes, the Government should more than
be able to meet these costs. The Ministry of Public Works has already budgeted
CFAF 1.2 billion (US$5.2 million) for FY 1981.
Procurement, Disbursement and Audits
56.       Procurement under the project would be in accordance with the
Bank-s procurement guidelines. The following procedures would apply:
Project Element                Procurement Procedure
(i) Equipment, Construction of        (i) International Competitive Bidding (ICB)
Workshops and Offices                 would apply to all items with the exception
of the US$8.0 million equivalent being
financed by the Netherlands which would be
tied to Dutch Procurement Procedures.

(ii)  Fuel and Lubricants            (ii)  Local competitive bidding.
(iii)  Materials and Spares for    (iii)  Government-s local Shopping Pro-
feeder road construction and         cedures, requiring quotations from at least
periodic and routine maintenance   three suppliers.
(iv)  Rehabilitation of gravel       (iv)  ICB; in small lots to enable local
roads                                contractors to compete.  Domestic contractors
will have a 7 1/2% preference.
(v)  Resealing of paved roads        (v)  ICB with a 7 1/2% preference for
domestic contractors (Not broken down into
small lots because resealing of paved roads
requires specific experience which the
small Voltaic contractors do not have).
(vi)  Consultant Services            (vi)  Final selection and terms and condi-
tions of contract to be approved by the
Association.
57.       The IDA credit will be disbursed on the following basis: 1/
Project Element                       Disbursement Procedure
(i)  Equipment, Spare Parts and       (i)  100 percent of foreign expenditures

million)
(vi)  Initial deposit in special    (vi)  US$0.6 million
account
(vii)  Unallocated                    (vii)  US$8.3 million
1/   All disbursements will be fully documented with the exception of expendi-
tures for spare parts and materials costing less than US$1,000, for which
statements of expenditures will be submitted.
58.       The government has agreed to select an auditor satisfactory to the
Association to prepare annual audits of the financial statements produced
by the MTPTU in conjunction with the usage of funds under the proposed IDA
credit (Section 4.02(a) of Credit Agreement).

Economic Evaluation, Benefits and Risks
59.       The overall economic rate of return of the project including re-
habilitation of paved and gravel roads, routine maintenance and feeder roads
construction is about 60 percent. The rate of return for the maintenance
component including the rehabilitation of the paved and gravel roads is in the
order of 70 percent, and that of the feeder road component, about 22 percent.
Beneficiaries of the investments are primarily the rural populations since a
major part of the proposed project constitutes complementary investments to
on-going or planned rural development projects currently financed by IDA and
others. Consumers should also benefit from the expected reduction in transport
cost, following the upgrading and improved maintenance of national roads, in
the form of lower transport rates for goods and passengers.
60.       The project presents financial and institutional risks.  The diffi-
cult resource position that the Government faces could result in the provision
of inadequate funds for maintenance, causing the program envisaged under the
project to fall short of its objectives. The proposed project also requires
coordination between programming and execution of operations, e.g. timely
provision of manpower and materials. These risks would be reduced through
annual review of Government-s road maintenance budget and program and the
provision of technical assistance to improve Government's resource management
capability.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
61.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Upper Volta and the Association and the Recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the
Association are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
62.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex III.
63.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
64.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project aims to develop the natural and human resources of the
Bougouriba ORD. Implementation of the livestock and infrastructure (wells,
roads, buildings) components has been successful, with appraisal targets
achieved for the most part, although with some delays and cost overruns. In
its fifth year (1979/80), the project achieved incremental production of
2,700 tons of cotton (145 percent above 1976/77), 3,600 tons of cereals, 270
tons of groundnuts, 60 tons of paddy, and 160 tons of meat. The rate of
return is estimated to be 15 percent compared with the appraisal estimate of
68 percent, now seen to be overly optimistic. Credit 496-UV is fully
disbursed, and interim financing is being provided by the EEC Special Action
Credit.
Credit 557:    Livestock Development Project.  US$6.0 Million Credit of
June 18, 1975; Effective Date: November 24, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project is assisting cattle production in the Dedougou and
Bobo-Dioulasso ORDs through group ranch development, improvement of veteri-
nary services, livestock marketing and meat processing facilities and the
provision of technical assistance. The first ranch was completed at the end
of 1979, and the second and third ranches are progressing satisfactorily.
Inscription of cattle has accelerated now that tsetse infestation has been
temporarily brought under control. Despite the reprieve, a longer term
program for tsetse control should be initiated. It had been foreseen that
livestock owners take management control of the ranches at advanced stages,
however at recent discussions with owners, continuation of assistance was
requested.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors on the pro-
gress of projects in execution, and in particular, to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

1975; Effective Date: February 11, 1976; Closing Date:
June 30, 1981
The project will improve and subsequently maintain 1,200 km of
rural roads. Maintenance will also be provided for 2,100 km of additional
rural roads, institutional support is given to the road organization,
highway equipment has been procured, and a study is being carried out to
assess the impact and effectiveness of road components included in agricul-
tural development projects financed by the Association over the last five
years. Despite an eighteen month delay in project start-up, the rate of
project implementation now matches appraisal estimates: two-thirds of the
improvement program has been completed and annual light maintenance corres-
ponds to appraisal targets. Bridge and culvert construction is being carried
out by force account due to lack of satisfactory response from local contrac-
tors. Activities of the first phase would be continued under the proposed
fourth highways project.
Credit 640:    Rural Development Fund II Project.  US$9.4 Million Credit
of June 21, 1976; Effective Date: January 24, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982
The project provides a line of credit to the Rural Development
Fund for investment in small-scale rural projects, the main purpose of which
is to increase crop production and improve village water supplies. The
investment program includes: bottomland development (2,700 ha); erosion
control works (9,200 ha); small-scale irrigation and improved bottomland
development (500 ha); construction of 520 wells, 180 tubewells, 400 village
warehouses and 20 village centers; provision of medium-term credit for
agricultural equipment and unidentified projects. The project is well
managed and is making good progress in implementing its components. Not all
appraisal targets may be reached, however, because Government priorities and
farmers' expectations have led project management to put more emphasis on
well construction and erosion control works and less on bottomland develop-
ment and small irrigation projects. To allow RDF to maintain its present
rate of activities until the proposed third phase project is approved, the
Government has obtained additional funds from the Netherlands.
Credit 653:    Third Highway Project.  US$20.0 Million Credit of July 15,

Closing Date: June 30, 1980
EEC Special    US$3.5 Million Equivalent;  Credit of January 11, 1980;
Action          Effective Date:  July 30, 1980;
Credit 38:      Closing Date:  December 31, 1981
The project consists of: (a) reconstruction of the Banfora-Bobo-
Dioulasso-Hounde road (183 km); (b) procurement of vehicle weight control and
traffic counting equipment; (c) road maintenance study; (d) preinvestment
study of the Ouagadougou-Kaya-Dori road; (e) technical assistance to the
Department of Transport (DOT); and (f) technical assistance to the domestic
contracting industry. The Bobo-Dioulasso-Hounde section was completed in June
1978, and the Bobo-Dioulasso-Banfora section in May 1979. Equipment for

vehicle weight control and traffic counting arrived in November 1979. The
technical assistance to the DOT has been in place since January 1977. The
Road Maintenance Study has been completed by BCEOM and reviewed, and is the
basis for the Fourth Highway Project. Arrangements for providing technical
assistance to domestic contractors are being finalized. In view of a project
cost overrun due to currency realignments and the need to reconstruct four
bridges, initially not included in the project, supplementary financing of
US$3.5 million is being provided through the EEC Special Action Account.

The project strengthens the ORDs of Bobo-Dioulasso and Dedougou
through provision of technical assistance and equipment; establishes a
Financial and Administrative Unit to assist project accounting and financial
control; finances a ginnery and training facilities for project extension
workers; supports an annual extension program; develops low cost irrigation
schemes; implements a pilot settlement component and a pilot women's component.
Aided by favorable weather, incremental cotton production in 1979/80 (19000
tons) was double the appraisal estimate. Cereal production is difficult to
assess with accuracy; means of improving monitoring of cereal output are
being discussed. The extension service, which is adopting the training and
visit approach, is improving in efficiency. The low cost irrigation schemes
and women's activities have fared poorly so far, and no action has been
taken on the pilot settlement project. The Financial and Administrative
Unit has established project accounts and updated cost statements and
budgets aimed at keeping future project expenditures in line with available
funds.
Credit 744:    Regional Railway Project in the Ivory Coast and Upper Volta
US$5.2 Million Credit of November 14, 1977; Effective Date:
December 20, 1978; Closing Date: December 31, 1982
The project finances priority items of the 1978-1979 portion of
the Regie Abidjan-Niger (RAN) 1977-1982 investment plan. It includes track
alignment and renewal of track material in the Ivory Coast; track improvement
in Upper Volta; procurement of locomotives; freight cars and track maintenance
equipment, provision of training facilities and consulting services for
technical training and management improvement and to carry out feasibility
studies. Major civil works are expected to be completed by end September
1981. All other physical components are being implemented but have experienced
delays due to administrative problems. Late contract awards have caused slow
execution of sleeper renewal and embankment construction. Ballast production
is also behind schedule. Some progress has, however, been noted with recent
improvements to RAN performance and services giving rise to increased freight
traffic. An Organization and Methods Unit will soon be operable to devise
transport plans for freight traffic and passenger traffic. Cost overruns of
about 20 percent are envisaged with RAN to cover the shortfall from its own
resources.

Million of January 12, 1978; Effective Date: April 12, 1978;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project provides a line of credit to the National Development
Bank (BND) for small and medium scale enterprises; technical assistance,
project preparation and follow-up and training for the National Center for the
Promotion of Rural Artisans (CNPAR) and the Organization for the Promotion of
Upper Voltan Enterprises (OPEV); technical assistance to the BND; a study on
industrial incentives; and a training program at the Department of External
Debt at the Treasury. Though technical assistance financed by the IDA credit
has had little impact on the long-term evolution of BND as a financially sound
institution, a commitment to devise a list of projects which would effectively
use IDA funds has been demonstrated. Additional assistance to the BND may be
forthcoming through German aid. OPEV and CNPAR activities are progressing
satisfactorily and funds allocated to them will likely be used within eighteen
months.
Credit 766:    Urban Development Project US$8.2 Million of March 23, 1978;
Effective Date: February 2, 1979; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981
The project consists of upgrading of approximately 7,000 plots in
Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso; preparation and servicing of 1,100 lots in
Bobo-Dioulasso; water supply facilities for an additional 2,500 families in
Ouagadougou who are not living in areas to be upgraded; housing construction
and improvement loans; community facilities, social services and technical
assistance to the municipalities of Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso and the
Department of town planning. Project start-up activities were financed
under two Project Preparation Facility advances and the budget of the Ministry
of Public works. Surveys and detailed engineering proceeded very slowly due
in part to the Ministry of Public Works tendency to shift away from previously
agreed upon design standards.  An agreement was reached at end 1979:   a) to
proceed on a pilot basis with the upgrading in the Cissin neighborhood with
particular attention being paid to affordable standards, minimizing demolition
and relocation, and community participation and b) to hire a municipal engi-
neer as Deputy Project Director. Community consultation in the area began in
March 1980. The project has been slow to attain the hoped for momentum and
should still receive close supervision.

Credit of November 15, 1979; Effective Date:
July 30, 1980; Closing Date: December 31, 1983
An extension of the First Education Project, the project would
expand the rural education system to youth who formerly had no access to
primary education through expansion, repair and equipping of physical
facilities, and training and management support. It would also provide
training for three categories of workers presently in short supply in Upper
Volta; agriculture project managers, building construction foremen, and road
and equipment maintenance personnel. Despite a six month delay in credit
effectiveness, some initial implementation activities have been carried out
through an advance from the Project Preparation Facility. The project has
had difficulties in organizing coordination among the Government agencies
involved. It is fairly complex, having thirteen components and requiring
close cooperation of seven different agencies. Close supervision of the
administrative aspects will be required.
Credit 982:    Forestry Project.  US$14.5 Million Credit of April 7, 1980.
Effective Date:  December 31, 1980; Closing Date:  December
31, 1984.
The project provides a comprehensive program to strengthen the
operational capacity of the Forestry Administration with staff and equipment
to carry out its assigned functions of protecting, developing and exploiting
the country's forest resources within the framework of the national forestry
plan. The project will also establish 1,600 ha of rainfed tree plantations
and 325 ha of rural woodlots in the Bobo-Dioulasso area, manage on a pilot
basis 1,000 ha of natural forest in the Maro-reserve and maintain previously
established rainfed tree plantations. A Project Preparation Facility advance
financed preliminary works begun in 1979, including a pedological study and
aerial survey of the Maro reserves and plantation maintenance and protection
works.
Credit 1013:   Niena Dionkele Rice Development Project.  US$6.5 Million
Credit of May 8, 1980; Effective Date: December 4, 1980;
Closing Date: December 31, 1984.
The project is a pilot phase of a possible three phase program to
convert swampland to more productive use. The main objectives of this phase
would be to test key assumptions regarding future development of swamp areas
and to address price structure, marketing and economic issues of the rice
subsector. The project will also assist Government to promote institution
building in the subsector, define a national rice policy, create a market
structure to ensure farmer confidence in rice production and train future
rice industry managers. Full scale project start-up is expected to be under-
way soon; minor activities were financed by the Project Preparation Facility.

An extension of the First Bougouriba Agricultural Development
Project (Credit 496-UV), the project aims at further increasing agricultural
and livestock production in the Bougouriba ORD. Attention will be concen-
trated on the technical management of rainfed agriculture by improved orga-
nization of training, extension, input distribution and credit. The project
also provides for the implementation of modest animal husbandry practices and
increased use of animal traction. Emphasis will be on increasing yields of
main food crops (millet and sorghum) together with recommendations for cash
crops (yams, groundnuts and cotton). The project includes small programs to
encourage more fruit and fuelwood tree planting, and erosion control.
