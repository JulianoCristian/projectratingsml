project outcome was satisfactory,\n            and sustainability is likely. The Government's\n            ownership, and commitment to the reform program were key\n            factors to its highly satisfactory performance, and, the\n            satisfactory performance by the Bank, was reflected in the\n            design of the operation, built on lessons from previous\n            programs, based on a clearly defined reform agenda,\n            emphasizing trade liberalization, and enlargement of the\n            domestic revenue base. Lessons suggest the simultaneous\n            implementation of indirect tax reform, gradual trade\n            liberalization, and rationalization of import procedures,\n            protected the budget from a potential decline in revenue,\n            which could have endangered fiscal adjustment, at the same\n            time as it reduced distortions in the allocation of\n            resources, and supported a strong supply response. But the\n            combination of prudent fiscal, and monetary policies, the\n            favorable external environment, and foreign assistance,\n            resulted in strong GDP growth, low inflation, and high\n            private investment. Furthermore, the focused nature of the\n            operation, which concentrated on a limited number of areas,\n            enabled the government to focus on actions considered\n            critical to the success of the overall reform process, and\n            helped implementation, in light of acute capacity constraints."}, "docdt": "2000-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
