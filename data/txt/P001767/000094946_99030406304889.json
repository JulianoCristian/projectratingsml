Economic Management Reform Operation\n            Project aims at sustaining growth with poverty reduction and\n            diminishing dependency on external aid over the medium to\n            long run. The project will be disbursed in two equal\n            tranches. The operation, designed to support explicit the\n            country assistance strategy and the heavily indebted poor\n            countries (HIPC) objectives, is part of a continuing set of\n            reforms designed to consolidate a stable macroeconomic\n            environment, sustain growth, and reduce poverty through\n            improvements in the sustainability of public service\n            delivery. However, the operation involves three types of\n            risks. First, in spite of progress in building institutional\n            and managerial capacity, weaknesses remain which could slow\n            down execution or compromise the quality of reforms. Second,\n            resistance to further trade liberalization and tax reform\n            might be expected. Third, parliamentary and presidential\n            elections are planned for 1999, involving some risk of\n            slippage in implementing reforms perceived to be unpopular.\n            These risks are mitigated by the Government's\n            demonstrated commitment to a wide-ranging reform program,\n            and by its ongoing efforts to carry out systematic\n            consultation with stakeholders."}, "docdt": "1998-11-17T00:00:00Z"}
