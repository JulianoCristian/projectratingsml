natural\n            events (such as hurricanes, floods etc.) through investing\n            in risk management activities; and (b) to strengthen the\n            institutional management and response capacity of the\n            respective ministries and agencies for disaster management\n            through the provision of facilities, critical equipment,\n            technical assistance and training. The Additional Financing\n            (AF) credit for the (DMP II) will scale up investments in\n            component 1: physical prevention and mitigation works (90\n            percent of project funds) and will allocate additional\n            project funds to component 4: project management (10 percent\n            of project funds). The rationale for the request is: (i) the\n            need for additional mitigation works to solidify the gains\n            achieved through works implemented in Dennery Village - one\n            of the most vulnerable communities as prioritized by the\n            government; (ii) the continuation of the successful small\n            mitigation works, including small works in response to last\n            year's Hurricane Dean, and completion of a technical\n            audit of the small mitigation works financed under the DMP\n            II; and (iii) the need to cover some of the additional\n            project management costs."}, "docdt": "2008-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
