                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project aims at further reducing the country's vulnerability to adverse natural events (hurricane, floods, etc.) through investment in risk management
                         activities. As such, the objectives of the project are to further strengthen (a) infrastructure against the impact of adverse natural events (hurricanes, flooding,
                         etc.) through the implementation of physical mitigation measures; (b) the response capacity in case of adverse natural event (hurricane, flooding, etc) through
                         capacity building, equipment purchase and investment in emergency infrastructure; and (c) the institutional capacity of the various ministries and agencies
                         dealing with disaster management through the provision of adequate facilities, critical equipment, technical assistance and training.

                         the capacity of the country to face these adverse natural events. It was the case last October, with the passage of Hurricane Tomas, where improved resilience, emergency
                         preparedness and response proved to be crucial (One of the most successfully tested systems was the Flood Warning System with the National Meteorological Service (NMS); The
                         overall early warning system functioned properly although some sub-components were not functional).
