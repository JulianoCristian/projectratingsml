Second Disaster\n            Management Project for St. Lucia were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory; risk to development outcome was moderate;\n            Bank performance was satisfactory and borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: the\n            passage of hurricane Tomas demonstrated that the emergency\n            communication equipment was inadequate due to lack of\n            maintenance. In future disaster vulnerability reduction\n            operations, there is a need to finance full system solutions\n            capable of transferring data and visuals in real time. The\n            engagement of communities in identifying and addressing\n            landslide risk reduction can bring good results. There is a\n            need for significant capacity building on the use and\n            interpretation of hazard and risk information. While\n            maintenance plans have been developed for all the structures\n            as part of the project, it is critical to ensure that the\n            Government remains fully committed to allocating the\n            necessary funding for periodic and scheduled maintenance.\n            The Bank's ability to stay engaged with Saint Lucia in\n            this agenda over a period of fifteen years has enabled the\n            Bank and Saint Lucia to learn together and to gradually\n            improve Saint Lucia's approach and capacity to manage\n            disaster risk. Specific vulnerability reduction\n            interventions reduce localized risk, but do not measurably\n            reduce risk at a national level."}, "docdt": "2012-08-29T00:00:00Z"}
