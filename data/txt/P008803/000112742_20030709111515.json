An increase in the efficiency of energy use was\n            largely achieved.  However, as only 29 percent of the energy\n            efficiency credit line was disbursed, and only 4 out of the\n            planned 10 regional sub-projects were implemented, the scope\n            of the completed investments is significantly smaller than\n            originally expected. The support of gas sector reform\n            through financing of critical studies included a partial\n            implementation of the Gas Sector Studies. Thus the\n            development impact of the project was limited compared to\n            what could have been achieved, and the project overall\n            outcome is rated unsatisfactory.  Some lessons learned\n            include: a) Local leadership and expertise, and availability\n            of counterpart funding, are essential for success.\n            Establishment of the local implementation capacity and\n            arrangements for local co-financing should be assigned the\n            highest priority. b) The Borrower should establish and\n            maintain arrangements to ensure interagency coordination and\n            single-point responsibility for project deliverables. C)\n            When appraising regional sub-projects, pay special attention\n            to assessing the creditworthiness of sub-borrowers."}, "docdt": "2003-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
