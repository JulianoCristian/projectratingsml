The project is expected to have both direct\n            impact in the targeted cities and indirect impact elsewhere\n            in Russia through the demonstration of technological and\n            managerial principles. The project consists of three\n            components: (a) gas distribution network improvements; (b)\n            energy efficiency investments; and (c) technical assistance.\n            The gas distribution network investments largely focus on\n            metering, cathodic protection, and pipe replacement. Energy\n            efficiency investment will focus on replacement of outdated\n            and inefficient equipment. Technical assistance is designed\n            both will support project implementation and to advance the\n            government's reform program. An initial program aimed\n            at greenhouse gas reduction, and financed under the Global\n            Environment Facility, is also linked to the project."}, "docdt": "1995-04-11T00:00:00Z"}
