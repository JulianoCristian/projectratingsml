The lessons learned indicate\n            that the demand survey for the Private Enterprise Support\n            Project (PESP) resulted in an overestimation of credit\n            demand and did not go far enough in identifying demand for\n            specific lending products. The PESP required partial payment\n            from enterprises for technical assistance. However, this\n            component was not successful as enterprises, generally were\n            not interested such assistance, perceiving the support\n            either as a waste or available free of charge through grant\n            financing. In the end, the project did not disburse any\n            funds for this component. It is important to make sure that\n            the implementation framework is clear from the outset of the\n            project and that lines of authority are unambiguous. While\n            the government has taken a number of important steps to\n            strengthen the business environment, PESP enterprise surveys\n            indicated a number of perceived deficiencies in the business\n            environment continue to adversely affect private enterprise\n            development. PESP had seven different task managers over an\n            eight-year period. Such changes substantially disrupted\n            project supervision, reduced institutional memory, and led\n            to frequent shifts in approaches and strategies. Auditing\n            remains a major issues for SME support projects in\n            underdeveloped financial and banking sectors such as the\n            Kyrgyz Republic."}, "docdt": "2004-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
