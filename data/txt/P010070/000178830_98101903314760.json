Of the 558 hotel rooms which meet\n            the Department of Tourism's standards, 500 are in\n            Kathmandu. The proposed project would add 271 rooms, which\n            it is estimated would provide accommodation for some 34,000\n            additional tourists per year. The project is made up of two\n            sub-projects, the extension and refurbishing of the existing\n            Hotel de l'Annapurna; and the construction of a new\n            hotel, to be called the Yak and Yeti Hotel. The project is\n            expected to be completed by the end of 1974. The credit\n            would cover 64 percent of the total financing."}, "docdt": "1972-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
