OF THE

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PREBIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE KINGDOM OF NEPAL FOR THE
KATHMANDU TOURISM PROJECT
1.      I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Nepal for the equivalent of US$ 4.2 million on
standard IDA terms to help finance a project for the expansion of hotel
accommodation in Kathmandu.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.      The Association has made two credits to Nepal totalling
uS$ 4.2 million. The first credit, for US$ 1.7 million, was signed
in November, 1969, for a telecommunications project;  the second, for
US$ 2.5 million, was signed in December, 1970, and provided financing
for highway maintenance, bridge reconstruction and the installation of
porter-trail bridges.   Both projects are expected to be completed before
the closing dates. A summary statement of the two credits as of
January 31, 1972, is attached as Annex I.
3.      In addition to the tourism project now proposed, two more projects
are in an advanced stage of preparation. The first is a combined surface
and groundwater irrigation project, in the vicinity of Birganj which would
benefit at least 20,000 farmers by irrigating 28,700 ha., permitting
increased production of rice and wheat and the improvement of sugar cane
cultivation. The second is a plywood or veneer factory project at Hetaura,
77 miles south of Kathmandu, which would also include modernization of
an existing sawmill.   A project for forestry settlement in Western Terai
and one for telecommunications are also being prepared. The telecommunications
project would be a continuation of the program financed by the 1969 credit.
4.      No Bank loans or IFC investments have been made in Nepal.
PART II - THE ECONOMY
5.      The most recent economic report entitled "Current Economic
Position and Prospects of Nepal" (SA-7a) dated June 26, 1969, was
distributed on July 8, 1969.   A memorandum summarizing recent economic
developments including country data is attached as Annex II.



6.      The economic report referred to above underlined the need for
administrative and technical skills, and better roads. Given the rapid
expansion in infrastructure, particularly roads in the last two years,
and the gratifying improvement in administration, the emphasis should
now shift towards making greater use of that infrastructure.
7.      Tourism represents Nepal's most promising avenue for increasing
its earnings of convertible foreign exchange. Nepal is a culturally unique
and scenically most beautiful country. The Kathmandu valley, with its
many pagodas and temples, colorful festivals, curios, bazaars, and hill
people provides a fascinating centre for the tourist. To this must be
added an almost ideal climate for 9 months of the year, and above all
the Himalayas, which form a beautiful background.
8.      In view of these attractions, it is hardly surprising that the
number of foreign arrivals has grown at some 37 percent a year since
1965, reaching 46,000 in 1970.   The recent upheavals in the sub-continent
mean a temporary hiatus in growth and arrivals have been much the same
in 1971 as in 1970.   However, more visitors are expected this year.
Transportation and accommodation during much of the period of rapid growth
have not been adequate to meet the demand.   The completion of an Asian
Development Bank project to modernize the equipment and extend the runway
of the Kathmandu airport, along with other improvements financed by the
Canadian Government, will make it easier for tourists to get to Nepal but
severely test the already overstrained facilities for accommodating, feeding
and entertaining the tourists on arrival.
9.      Direct foreign exchange earnings from tourism are difficult
to estimate, as many tourist transactions are made through the free
market.   The official estimate of gross direct foreign exchange earnings
was US$ 1.3 million equivalent in 1969/70, but actual earnings may well
have been almost double this, and probably accounted for over 10% of
convertible foreign exchange earnings.   Direct full-time employment in
tourism throughout the country probably does not exceed 1,500 but substantial
numbers of porters are employed seasonally and tourists also constitute
an important market for handicraft products.
10.     The difficulties and constraints which the growth of tourism has
faced in the past are now gradually being overcome. In addition to the
improvement of the Kathmandu airport referred to above, and the present
project to expand hotel accommodation, there are a number of other
foreign-aided activities. Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation has a technical
assistance agreement with Air France. UNDP and IL0 plan to help set up
a hotel training school in Kathmandu and the Government has also received
assistance in developing tourism from the German and Swiss governments.
UNESC0 is working on the identification, protection and restoration of
antiquities.

PART III - THE PROJECT
11.     An Appraisal Report entitled "Appraisal of the Kathmandu Tourism
Project, Nepal" (PT-4) is being distributed separately.  A Credit and
Project Summary is attached as Annex III. The project was appraised in
July 1971, and negotiations for the proposed credit were completed in
January 1972.  The Borrower was represented by Messrs. R.P. Sharma,
Acting Joint Secretary, Ministry of Finance, and B.P. Rimal, First
Secretary, Royal Ebbassy of Nepal in Washington; Mr. R.N. Rimal
represented the Nepal Industrial Development Corporation (NIDC);
Mr. Om Rana represented Hotel de l'Annapurna Pvt. Ltd. (Annapurna);
and Mr. Boris Lissanevitch, Yak and Yeti Hotel Pvt. Ltd. (Yak and Yeti).
12.     Kathmandu is the main center for foreign tourists and the only
place where hotels are up to international standards.   Of the 558 hotel
rooms which meet the Department of Tourism's standards, 500 are in
Kathmandu. The proposed project would add 271 rooms, which it is estimated
would provide accommodation for some 34,000 additional tourists per year.
The project is made up of two sub-projects, the extension and refurbishing
of the existing Hotel de l'Annapurna; and the construction of a new
hotel, to be called the Yak and Yeti Hotel. The project is expected to
be completed by the end of 1974.   The credit would cover 64 percent of
the total financing.
13.     The proposed credit would be made to the Government of Nepal and
onlent to the sponsors through the NIDC. Each sub-loan would bear
interest at 7½ percent per annum plus i percent commitment charge and
would be for a term of 24 years including 4 years of grace. The sub-borrowers
would bear the exchange risk.   NIDC wJould act on behalf of the Government,
in return for a service charge, in channelling the proceeds of the credit
to the sponsors and in providing administrative and technical supervision
of the sub-projects.   NIDC has agreed, subject to confirmation by the
Government, that the service charge in Nepalese rupees should be the
equivalent of US$ 20,000 annually for the first four years, and US$ 4,000
equivalent annually thereafter until the sub-loans are repaid.  The
completion of the arrangements between the Government and NIDC is a
condition of effectiveness of the Credit Agreement.
14.     NIDC is a wholly Government-owned institution established in 1959
to finance industry and tourism. Most of its funds are provided by the
Government and the balance by loans from USAID, the Government of India,
Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau, and the Export-Import Bank of Japan.
NIDC is a reasonably well-run institution with qualified staff and
considerable experience in hotel projects in Nepal. However, arrears have
accumnmulated on some of its loans.  NIDC is currently taking steps to
improve its debt collection record.   NIDC's role in this project would be



limited to channelling Government lending to the sub-borrowers and
supervising the administration of the sub-loans and NIDC itself would
not be at risk.
15.     On behalf of the Government, NIDC will enter into agreements
with Annapurna and Yak and Yeti for the financing of the respective
sub-projects, such agreements to be satisfactory to the Association and
to incorporate provisions substantially similar to those set forth in
Schedule 5 to the draft Development Credit Agreement. NIDC will hold
mortgages on behalf of the Government on the fired assets of the sub-borrowers
to secure their respective loans.   The interest rate charged on the sub-
loans would be the same as that charged by NIDC to other borrowers
(currently 71½ percent).  The completion of the Annapurna Agreement and
the Yak and Yeti Agreement is a condition of effectiveness of the respective
parts of the credit.
16.     Hotel de l'Annapurna:  The total cost of the sub-project is
US$ 4.08 million equivalent and would be financed by:
(a)   IDA (Part A of the proposed credit):  US$ 2.88 million
equivalent, representing estimated foreign exchange costs;
(b)   Sponsors:  US$ 1.20 million equivalent, as equity,
representing local costs.
In addition, NIDC would lend on behalf of the Government
US$ 0.4 million equivalent in local currency, representing estimated
interest and other charges during construction.
17.     The existing hotel is located in central Kathmandu, within walking
distance of many tourist attractions. The project would create around
this nucleus new accommodation of first-class international standard,
while keeping the present hotel open.   159 new rooms would be built
and 82 of the present rooms would be refurbished to provide a total of
241 double rooms.   Eight of the existing rooms would be eliminated to
make space for enlarged public areas.   Central air-conditioning and a
central hot water system would be installed. A coffee shop, a main
dining room and a speciality restaurant would be provided, a lounge and
bar space expanded. A swimming pool with a patio bar would be built, and
the tennis courts relocated and improved. The hotel would have its own
laundry and dry cleaning plant.   Exterior design and interior decoration
would be to a high standard, and care would be paid to landscaping.
18.     The present Hotel de l'Annapurna was opened in 1965 as a private
partnership which in March 1971, was converted into a company with limited
liability.   The Company has an authorized 'capital of NTRs. 20 million
(approximately US$ 2.0 million equivalent) of which NRs. 6.4 million is



paid up.   This includes the conversion into equity of a NRs. 5.1 million
loan by the shareholders, that was completed last autumn, and evidence
of which is a condition of effectiveness of Annapurna's part of the credit.
The Company owns the existing Hotel de l'Annapurna and is financially
sound. Its three shareholders are members of the Royal family.
19.     Few Nepalese have had experience in operating hotels of the size
and class proposed.   The success of the proposed project will depend
on competent management and adequate staffing of the new hotels. The
existing Hotel de l'Annapurna had an interim management agreement with
Hilton International Company (Hilton). Hilton had to withdraw in view of
the small size of the operation, but the basic management agreement
providing for Hilton management of the new hotel on completion, together
with technical assistance, training and marketing services remains in force.
With assistance from Hilton, training schemes for the staff have been
arranged and are to be expanded, including some training in Hilton hotels
abroad.
20.     The Yak and Yeti Hotel: The total cost of the sub-project is
US$ 1.92 million equivalent and would be financed by:
(a) IDA (Part B of the proposed credit): US$ 1.32 million
equivalent, representing the estimated foreign exchange
costs;
(b) Sponsors: US$ 0.60 million equivalent, as equity,
representing local costs.
In addition, NIDC would lend on behalf of the Government
US$ 0.18 million equivalent in local currency, representing estimated
interest and other charges during construction.
21.     The site for this hotel is in the grounds of an old palace, which
houses the present successful Yak and Yeti Restaurant. The palace grounds
include a small lake, and the site lends itself to attractive landscaping.
The project provides for a new access road directly from one of Kathmandu's
main thoroughfares. The proposed hotel would include 24 single rooms,
84 double rooms each with a balcony and 6 suites.    Provision would be made
for a coffee shop, a bar and access to the existing restaurant. It would
have a swimming pool, tennis courts, a sauna and a roof garden.   The
preliminary drawings by a Nepalese architect suggest that the exterior of
the hotel would be simple and attractive. Maximum use would be made
throughout of local wood carvings and other handicrafts, and the high
standard of interior design evident in the Yak and Yeti Restaurant would be
maintained.



22.     Yak and Yeti would acquire an access road for the new hotel
across land owned by NIDC.   During negotiations representatives of
NIDC and of Yak and Yeti confirmed that they had reached preliminary
agreement on the acquisition and that the agreement was being
considered by the NIDC Board. Acquisition of the access road is a condition
of effectiveness of Yak and Yeti's part of the credit.
23.     Yak and Yeti's shareholders are a British businessman,
Mr. Lissanevitch, with long association with the hotel trade in Nepal,
and an Indian businessman, Mr. Radesham Saraf, with substantial trading
and industrial interests in India and Nepal, and members of his family.
The Company has an authorized capital of NRs. 5 million of which NRs. 1.0
million is paid up. The Company owns the existing Yak and Yeti Restaurant
and is financially sound.
24.     Yak and Yeti intends to employ qualified expatriate personnel in
the key positions in the management of the new hotel. Mr. Lissanevitch
managed a hotel in Kathmandu successfully for 12 years, after many years
hotel experience in India and Europe. His three sons are to be trained
in leading hotels in Europe.
25.     Procurement, carried out by sub-borrowers under NIDC's supervision,
would be on the basis Of international competitive bidding. Bidders for
civil works would be prequalified. In evaluating bids, a preference of
15 percent, or the existing rate of duty (whichever is lower), would be
allowed for domestic manufacturers of equipment and furniture.   Whether
domestic or foreign contractorsshould win the bids, the foreign exchange
component in total project costs would vary little as both domestic and
foreign contractors need to import most materials, equipment and specialized
labor.
26.     Disbursements from the credit account would be made on the
following basis:
(i)   70 percent of expenditures for civil works contracts, being
the estimated foreign exchange costs;
(ii)   100 percent of expenditures for equipment and furniture;   and
(iii)   100 percent of foreign exchange expenditures for professional
services, technical assistance and pre-opening expenses.
Provision is made in the draft Credit Agreement for the
reimbursement for expenses paid for professional services in
preparing the sub-projects between January 1, 1972, and the
date of signing the Credit Agreement. These expenses are
expected to amount to $45,OO0.



- 7 -
27.     The term of the sub-loans, 24 years including four years of
grace, is justified on project grounds and takes into account the life
of the assets financed. If dividends exceeding 20 percent of the par
value of the share capital are paid in any financial year, repayment
of the sub-loan will be accelerated by the amount of the excess.
28.     The estimated financial returns on total investment range from
about 9 percent to about 11 percent for Annapurna,and from about 7 percent
to about 9 percent for Yak and Yeti, depending on the assumptions made
with regard to occupancy rates and opening date. The best estimate of
the economic rate of return is about 20 percent for each sub-project.
Additional direct employment created by the project is estimated at 500
jobs, and net direct fc.reign exchange earnings are expected to be of
the order of US$ 2.8 million per annum at full operation thus more than
doubling Nepal's net earning from tourism. Non-quantifiable indirect
benefits would include increased employment from tourist expenditures
and increased revenues from taxation.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
29.     The draft Development Credit Agreement between Nepal and the
Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V,
Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a resolution
approving the proposed credit are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately. Schedule 4 to the draft Development Credit Agreement
sets out the provisions to be included in the arrangements between the
Nepalese Goverment and NIDC. Schedule 5 contains provisions for the loan
agreements between NIDC and Annapurna and Yak and Yeti for the relending
of the Credit proceeds. Article VII if the draft Development Credit
Agreement permits the Credit to become effective separately with respect
to each hotel, in case the conditions of effectiveness relating to one
of the hotels are fulfilled before those relating to the other.
30.     I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
31.     I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

ANNEX II
Page 1
REVIEW OF THE ECONO?MC SITUATION OF NEPAL
1.       The conventional indicators of economic progress are of little
utility in a country like Nepal. In the first place there are few
reliable statistics on output and fewer still which are available on
a sufficiently current basis to permit assessment of short-term
progress. Secondly, even if they were available they would not give
an indication of qualitative changes, which in a country like Nepal,
which is at the very first stages of the development process, are of
critical importance. The first road connecting Kathmandu, the
capital, to the outside world was only completed in 1956, and some
90 percent of the population is still engaged in agriculture. These
are the facts against which the progress made since the date of the
last Bank Economic Report on Nepal (June, 1969) must still be viewed.
2.       Nepal is a land-locked country forming a rectangle between
India and China. The northern border is formed by the Himalayas, the
central area consists of hills and valleys and the southern area, the
Terai, is a natural continuation of the Indo-Gangetic plain, with a
virtually open border between Nepal and India. These geographic and
topographical factors have been the primary determinants both of the
past economic structure and the one which is developing. Some 90
percent of Nepal's trade is with India. India is also the major foreign
donor, contributing some 50 percent of total aid. Even the balance of
Nepal's trade which is not directly with India must go through Calcutta
port. Given the open border on the one hand and Nepal's strategic
importance as a buffer state between India and China on the other, it
is apparent that there are a great many potential sources of tension
inherent in the relationship between Nepal and India.
3.       In view of this, perhaps the most satisfying and important
achievement for Nepal in the past year has been the successful renegotia-
tion of the Treaty of Trade and Transit with India. This Treaty,
originally concluded in 1960 for ten years, was a device for giving
special facilities to Nepalese manufacturers im the Indian market and
also ensuring Nepal's transit rights.  In the middle years of the decade,
however, Nepal, seeking to diversify its exports to countries other
than India, introduced an import entitlement scheme which permitted
exporters to use a certain percentage of their receipts both for free
imports from third countries and for a specified list of development
goods. At the time this seemed a reasonable step for Nepal to take
given the budgetary burden which direct export subsidies would have
constituted.
4.       Unfortunately, the import entitlement scheme did not serve only
to stimulate Nepalese exports to third countries. It also provided a means



ANNEX II
Page 2
of exploiting certain general provisions in the Treaty of Trade and
Transit to secure high profits through importing goods which were subject
to import bans in India - such as stainless steel and synthetic textiles -
and after minimal processing exporting these to India as Nepalese
manufactures. The open border also made it difficult to prevent the
smuggling of imported consumer goods into India and even of Indian
export products, such as Jute, into Nepal for re-export as Nepalese exports.
Since the import entitlements were only a percentage (varying as to commodity)
of total export receipts, Nepal has been able to build up its exchange
reserves during the past three years to around $100 million in hard
currencies, or over a year's imports from all sources including India,
and something like 10 years' imports from countries other than India.
5.      From Nepal's point of view, however, the trade has also had a
number of drawbacks. It was largely organized by Indian merchants and the
large profits were therefore not re-invested. The transit situation
already difficult through the inadequacies of Calcutta port became still
more difficult as customs officials applied rigorous checks, understandably,
to both legitimate and other items.   Perhaps most significantly, nothing
was done in the late sixties about the urgent task of diversifying and
promoting industries with high value-added in Nepal. The consequence has
been that even the simplest consumer goods continue to be imported from
India rather than being made locally. In addition, Nepal has not developed
production in a number of areas where it apparently has a comparative
advantage such as wood products, animal and vegetable oils and fats, and
hydro-power.
6.      In 1968 the Government of India began taking unilateral action to
limit the export of stainless steel and synthetic textiles. The Nepalese
government closed a loophole in their regulations which had permitted the
duty-free import of 'gift parcels' containing goods which were subsequently
smuggled into India. Protracted negotiation to find a solution acceptable
to both parties continued through 1970, but afterone extension the Treaty
was permitted to lapse at the end of the year. The consequence of this was
the application to Nepal of the same trade restrictions as applied to
India's trade with third countries with the exception of a limited list
of necessary items. India unilaterally limited Nepalese jute exports to
an estimate of local production and relations between the two countries
entered a difficult phase.
7.      The conclusion of a new Treaty of Trade and Transit in June of
this year is an important step in creating a sound basis for economic
relations between the two countries which will permit Nepal's legitimate
industries to develop along sound lines. The basis of the Treaty is a
value-added formula which gives preference to items manufactured in Nepal
which have high local value-added. The provisions of the Treaty are broad,
however, and, while the spirit is fairly clear, India has at least



ANNEX II
Page 3
potentially the right to limit the export to India of a very wide range
of Nepalese manufactures wlhich might compete with Indian industry
including some in which Nepalese production would have comparative
advantages. Fortunately there is every indication that the spirit of
the Treaty recognizes that Nepal's infant industrial sector will need
access to the Indian market if it is ever to develop significantly.
On the transit front too, India has made a number of concessions which
should make this less of a bottleneck than it has proved at times in
the past.
8.      All this would be of somewhat academic interest were it not that
there is reason to think that Nepal is better placed than ever before to
make a real effort at increasing both agricultural and industrial output
and significantly increasing the very low level of per capita income of
its population. In a strikingly short period the length of motorable
roads in NTepal has been increased and continues to be increased. Journeys
that took weeks by porter now take hours by truck. The East/West trunk
network linking all parts of the Terai and obviating the former necessity
of going via India from one part of NJepal to another, is almost half
(the Eastern part) complete, thanks to Indian, Russian, U.S. and U.K.
assistance. The Indian road to Kathmandu now goes through to the Tibetan
border. This was extended by Mainland China which is also completing a
road along the hills, westward to Pokhara. The thrust is now towards
North/South roads which will link the hilly areas to the Terai plain.
Two are being completed and others are being studied.
9.      Aside from the impact these new roads will have on the administration
of the country, they also represent the basic infrastructure for development,
around which agricultural production can be increased through easier supply
of inputs and a market for output.   Industrial production can now be geared
to a much larger market than just the Kathmandu valley.    Economic exchange
of complementary products between the hills and the Terai1 will also be
possible, in particular the transfer of grain from the Terai to meet the
food deficit in the hills.   Nor are the roads the only available infrastructure.
With Indian and Chinese assistance, powier generating capacity has been
expanded considerably in excess of present demand. The telecommunications
system has been expanded with Indian and World Bank assistance.    A number
of major irrigation canals, adjuncts of Indian works along the southern
border have been built.
10.     This rapid expansion in infrastructure, provides the motivation for
a shift in emphasis towards productive sectors in the new Plan. This is,
of course, always more easily written than achieved. The proposals to
raise agricultural production, set up new industries and exploit Nepal's
rich potential in forestry and as a tourist venue, remain to be
satisfactorily implemented. In this connection it is noteworthy that the



ANNEX II
Page 4
three projects the Bank is presently at the most advanced stage of
considering all come into this category of making use of the infrastructure
already developed. In the past, efforts have been much too scattered.
Horticultural research, for example, has been carried out in areas remote
from any road and the results of its application could not be marketed.
There is a realization of the need to concentrate efforts in areas where
the transport system has been developed and as a corollary to develop
the transport system in areas with the greatest economic potential.
11.     Nepal is going, for a very long time, to be essentially dependent
on agricultural production for the major expansion in its GDP. At present
Nepal is a surplus foodgrain producer exporting around 300,000 tons of
foodgrains a year to India. Production is estimated to have increased
by about 2 percent per annum in the past few years or roughly the same rate
as population growth. The exportable surplus has remained much the same.
In the short run there is little doubt that very high returns should be
available from increased foodgrain production. Yields are low and the
irrigation capacity that has been created lies almost totally unutilized.
The major task will be to make proper use of this capacity, through
management, supply of inputs and extension services. In the last two
years there has at least developed an awareness of the critical nature
of these problems, though with insufficient supporting finance and
facilities, and too little delegated authority. The links between
research and extension remain weak. In the longer run, Nepal will need
to diversify its agriculture to provide the cash crops for its industrial
sector and to mitigate the expected decline in terms of trade for
foodgrain exports to India. The first tentative steps in this direction
are being taken at present.
12.     The industrial sector in Nepal is tiny - some 2 percent of GDP.
There are a number of Chinese and Russian aided factories in the public
sector, few of them adequately managed. The lack of trained management
personnel and skilled labor is a sericus constraint on the progress of
the sector, but there are a number of other difficulties as well. In the
past the size of the market and competition from Indian producers have
been sizeable problems, but these will be alleviated by the new roads and
the successful conclusion of the Treaty. There are plans for a fairly
rapid expansion of the industrial sector in the short run. There are
obvious possibilities, in import substitution, particularly, e.g. food
processing, textiles, etc. A great deal will depend on the appropriate-
ness of government policy which has been as much of a hindrance as a
help to industrial growth in the past.
13.     In the long run, forestry and tourism offer Nepal-I's most promising
hopes for earning convertible foreign exchange. Little use has been made
of forest resources, but the stage is now set with the initiation
of land-use planning and proposed plywood and pulp and
paper  factories.   Nepal's  forests  are  being depleted due to    the

pressue on land in the hill areas. Migrants from the hills are moving
down into the Terai, and particularly into regions from which malaria
has only recently been eradicated or control begun. These squatters
burn down forest areas indiscriminately and cultivate the land. This
movement cannot be stopped in the short run, but it can be controlled.
The government is taking steps to identify the most promising stands of
timber and restrict settlement to other areas. Resettlement schemes are
being organized for this group but cannot at present keep pace with the
influx. In the longer run, economic opportunities other than subsistence
farming will have to be developed in the hill areas to meet their needs.
14.     The potential which exists for increased production and the
availability of infrastructure will not in themselves be sufficient
unless there is evidence of the organizational and administrative capacity
which can make this a reality.   In the past, public investment in Nepal
has not been constrained by lack of resources, either external or internal.
The limits of trained manpower and organizational efficiency have been reached
well before those of various donors. This is no longer true. It appears
that in the next few years Nepal will face severe internal resource
constraints. In addition there is some anticipation that the volume of
foreign assistance (about $25 million per annum), may level off rather than
expand, relative to the Plan forecasts. The proportion of tax revenue
to GDP in Nepal is very low indeed. This is understandable given the very
high proportion of subsistence agriculture in total income and the sheer
inaccessibility of much of the country for tax purposes. The government
is heavily dependent on trade for its revenues and the recent trade
difficulties led to a revenue shortfall in the region of 25 percent as
compared to the budget estimates. While this is only temporary, some
basic restructuring of the tax system will probably be necessary if the
kind of resources which Will be needed to match foreign aid and compensate
for its failure to increase, are to be generated.
15.     Perhaps the most striking and promising development in the Nepalese
economy, indeed in the society as a whole, has been the increase in
administrative capacity at all levels during the past few years. This
has taken some time to show itself, and it would be idle to pretend that
there is not still a long way to go, but overall the achievements go far
beyond what one would have predicted only a short while ago.   At that
stage the administration seemed to depend on a limited number of very able
Secretaries who received little support. The planning process was weak,
and implementation weaker still. There was no co-ordination, and departments
often seemed far more interested in stopping others from doing anything
than doing any-thing themselves. This is changing. Planning cells have
been set up in most of the operating ministries which have provided a
broader focus to the work of the departments. A large number of younger
people with local or foreign training have come into the ministries and
departments with new ideas and a receptivity to change. A surprisingly



ANNEX II
Page 6
effective administrative training centre has been set up in a very short
time. The need for co-ordination has been realized and if it still
remains largely informal there is evidence that a sense of priorities
is beginning to pervade the government. The projects are being
concentrated around the roads, and major emphasis is on utilizing the
capacity which has been created.
16.       One of the most important areas of change is the education sector.
Nepal has only about 10 percent of its population literate. It is
difficult to see development in the long run without a major improvement
in education. On the other hand, it is already beginning to show signs
of all the problems of an education system which is geared to producing
university degrees for white-collar workers -- usually in government. A
firm stand is being taken with the introduction of a new education plan
which aims at a considerable expansion of education but along vocational
lines with major emphasis on agriculture. In addition, the plan will
also aim at remedying the serious deficiencies in middle-level manage-
ment. The three elements in this, firstly the education system,
secondly the manpower needs of the country, and thirdly the whole
structure of expectations and incentives, particularly in the public
service, renain, however, to be tied together.  It is hoped that this
will be done and the plan effectively implemented.
17.        All this should serve to illustrate that Nepal's econony has
reached a critical stage at which the capacity to do things, both
physical and administrative, has begun to measure up to the economic
potential. That developments will now take place is far from being a
foregone conclusion. A number of difficult steps will need to be taken
and the quality and confidence which the administration has built up
in the past few years will need to be maintained and improved.
Nevertheless, given this, there is room for guarded optimism about the
economic outlook.
