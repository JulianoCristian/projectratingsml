MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTEEN&TIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FR A PRIMARY SCHOOL TVACHEX DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development loan to the Republic of Indonesia for US$36.6 million equivalent
is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would have a term of 20 years,
including a grace period of 5 years, at the Bank's staniard variable interest
rate, and would help finance a Primary School Teacher Development Project.
2.        Babkgxmid. Universal access to primary school (grades 1-6) has
been virtually achieved in Indonesia. The primary subsystem is vast and
dispersed reaching 27 million students, and including 1.2 million teachers and
143,000 schools. Poor and uneven quality has been a chronic problem. Rapid
enrollment expansion during 1976-86 (4.7X per year) and unattractiveness of
teaching as a career are two major factors which have led to the nation's
classrooms being staffed with inadequately prepared teachers. Yet research
shows that teacher quality is a critical factor in educational quality. The
significant fertility decline of the 1980s has resulted in a levelling off of
primary enrollment. The drop in demand for new teachers since 1987 and the
relative youth of the existing teacher force creates a window of opportunity,
allowing policy makers to turn their focus to improving teacher quality.
3.        Government Subsector Strategr.  The New Education Policy (1988) and
Law No. 2 (1989) on Basic Education formalize Government's policy to improve
education quality. To improve teaching quality, the Law mandates that an
innovative pilot project (SPP/CBSA) providing professional support to teachers
is to be disseminated to all provinces with support from the Bank-financed
Primary Education Quality Improvement Project (PEQIP). In 1990 the Government
decided to change teacher appointment criteria: prospective and practicing
teachers are now expected to earn a two-year diploma (D-II) in Primary School
Teacher Education (PGSD) offered to new teachers at teacher training
institutes (IKIPs) or university education faculties (FRIPs) and their
associated study centers (UPPa). Serving teachers can also earn this diploma
through distance education programs created by the Indonesian Open University.
To avoid the over-production of teachers and to shift the focus to quality,
the Government drastically reduced the previous annual output of 75,000 new
teachers and has decided to restrict intake in the new pre-service program to
7,000 teachers in the initial years. The Government has also introduced
improved promotion opportunities for teachers, and revitalized Coordination
Forums to facilitate rational teacher supply and placement decisions.
4.        Prolect Objectlives and Deserintion.  The project would enhance
primary school teachers training through a new tertiary-level teacher diploma
course.
5.        To enhance grofessional development of teacher educators, the
project would support a sequence of integrated training activities for PGSD
teaching staff, including In-country and out-of-country experience in primary
schools, observation of approaches to primary teacher education in selected
countries, and participation in short-term and long-term training courses,
foreign and domestic. To generate local capacity to train primary teacher



-2-
educators and researchers, Master's level (S2) primary school teacher
education programs would be developed at the three IKIPs which grant advanced
degrees. Domestic undergraduate courses (S1) in primary teacher education
would also be initiated to allow lecturers to acquire a second degree in a
high priority field and to provide a pathway to careers in teacher education
for exceptional primary school teachers.
6.        The project would seek to strenathen primary teacher education
nro.gr=u, both pre-service and in-service, by improving their cu-V4cula,
developing effective teaching and assessment strategies, and providing
appropriate field-tested learning materials. Curricular revisions are to be
made on the basis of: (a) current and emerging views oi expected teacher
competencies; (b) evaluation of PGSD programs during their first two years of
operation; (c) studies of the characteristics and learning needs of PGSD
program recruits; and (d) analysis of the new primary school curriculum, due
to be introduced in 1994.
7.        To establish a coordinated system for teacher suInly and
distribution, the project would facilitate:  (a) the development of an
appropriate formula for determining the number of teachers needed in schools
of various sizes; (b) the introduction e-f an information system for tracking
changes in teacher distribution; (c) targeted recruitment of teacher training
candidates from teacher shortage areas; (4) scholarship support for needy
candidates from target areas; and (e) cooperation between the Directorate-
General of Higher Education (DGHE) and other related agencies (in and ou-.s.
the Ministry of Education and Culture) (MOEC) to secure appropriate teaching
jobs for PGSD graduates.
8.        The project would also support the creation of research 4;d
develgpm=  caRacit  among primary teacher educators through research grants,
technical assistance, and training and policy development workshops for
national policy studies and action-oriented research projects. The focus
would be on policy-oriented research, directed towards the improvement of
primary teacher education, rather than emphasizing more academic research.
Quality control of policy studies would be the esponsibility of a Research
Quality Control Board. A Center for Primary Education Research and
Development would be established at IMIP Yogyakarta, which would conduct
research, organize training workshops, supervise small grants, produce a
research journal and provide bibliography and abstracting services.
9.        Initiatives to be supported under the proposed project for
strengthening the management of primarv teacher education programs, include:
(a) establishing a Subdirectorate for Teacher Education within DGHE;
(b) strengthening DGHE's Project Implementation Unit in its management of
Bank-financed activities; (c) strengthening primary teacher education
management and instructional quality at IKIPs/FXIPs and their UPPs;
(d) strengthening ties between pre-service and in-service training, and
between PGSD training and PEQIP activities; and (e) a Management Study for
PGSD system.
10.       Project Imolementation and SustaLiabilitv.  The DGHE is responsible
for the D-II PGSD programs, including the proposed project with participation



-3-
of related agency staff. At the center a Coordinating Forum for Teacher
Supply and Development has been established to provide close coordination and
cooperation among other agencies concerned with teacher supply and placemert.
A Central Steering Council chaired by the Director-General of Higher Education
would provide the policy guidelines to the project Implementation Unit
established in DGHE. To support project implementation adequate technical
assistance and fellowships would be provided under the project. The
Government decision to drastically reduce annual output of primary school
teachers from 75,000 to 7,000 under the project (para. 3) will generate a
significant savings estimated at US$10.6 million per year or US$53.0 million
over the project period. These savings will not only make the proposed
project financially sustainable but also enable the NOEC to concentrate its
efforts on improving the quality of education.
11.       Lessons Learned from Past Projects.  The project's content and
design draw on lessons comprehensively highlighted in the recent OED Report,
An Assessment of Two Decades of Lending, (Report No. 9752) and the Basic
Education Study (Report No. 7481). Because of its long country experience in
the education sector, its worldwide access to the findings of research on
basic education and teacher education, poverty alleviation and service
delivery, the Bank's assistance will help the Government improve primary
education quality nationally through provision of well-prepared teachers.
12.       Rationale for hank Involvement.  Assistance for human resource
development continues to be a major element of Bank strategy in Indonesia,
both as a means to alleviate poverty and as a prerequisite for sustained
economic growth. As Indonesia's educational system moves close to providing
adequate levels of access and coverage, the focus of Bank assistance has
shifted to sustaining and consolidating those gains through support for
efforts to improve quality. Assistance to improving the quality of primary
education is seen as a basis for continuing quality improvement at the
secondary and tertiary levels. The proposed project would complement the
Bank-assisted PEQIP (approved in March 1992) which aims to improve primary
education quality and ultimately raise student achievement and completion
rates.
13.       Actions Agreed.  During negotiations, the Government agreed to:
(a) asrign returnees from overseas and in-country degree programs to
appropriate PGSD positions for a stipulated period; (b) develop an appropriate
formula for determining teacher needs by August 31, 1994 and send it to the
Bank for review and comment; (c) ensure that scholarship recipients from
targeted areas serve in teacher shortage areas for a stipulated period;
(d) prepare a plan of action for the implementation of the recomendations of
the policy studies for the consideration of the policymakers; (e) establish a
Research Quality Control Board with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank
by August 31. 1992; (f) prepare and furnish to the Bank a plan to strengthen
management of its teacher education programs by April 30, 1993 and carry out
such plans taking into account the comments of the Bank, in accordance with a
timetable acceptable to the Bank; (g) send findings and recommendations of a
PGSD Management Study to the Bank by December 31, 1995 for review and comment;
(h) consult the Bank if the Government determines that D-II PGSD program
intake needs to be greater than 8,000, before any decision to increase intake



-4-
is made; and (i) hold annual and mid-term project review meeting ivith the
Bank.
14.       Benjafit.  The ultimate benefit would be improved quality of primary
education as a result of better trained teachers under the proposed project.
Other benefits include: (a) the development of professional primary educators
currently lacking in Indonesia; (b) allc_ation of teachers in a more equitable
way; (c) improved content and methods of teacher training; (d) higher
standaids of curriculum development and implementation; (e) strengthened
capacity of research and development on primary education; and (f) strength-
ened planning and management capacity of central and local governments for
primary teacher ed4cation.
15.       The main risM  are that the activities of this project involve an
unusual degree of interdependence, span a wide geographical area and depend on
action at various levels of government administration and between DGHE and
DGPSE. Therefore, effective coordination and management is especially
important to attain project objectives. Provision is made under the project
for workshops and seminars for all relevant parties to encourage joint
discussion and action. In addition, the project management structure ensures
representation of the major parties involved.
16.       RscommendatIon. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the loan.
