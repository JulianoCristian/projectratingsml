This will be achieved by provision of\n            relevant civil works, equipment, books and learning\n            materials, technical assistance, staff development, and\n            operational support for:  (a) developing primary teacher\n            educators; (b) strengthening primary teacher education\n            programs; (c) establishing a coordinated system for teacher\n            supply and distribution; (d) building capacity for research\n            and development (R&D) in primary education; and (e)\n            strengthening the management of the primary teacher\n            education system.  Component (a) will provide support for a\n            variety of in-country and overseas training programs for\n            teacher educators and for generating local capacity to\n            conduct master's level programs for primary teacher\n            educators and researchers.  Component (b) will improve the\n            diploma program and curricula materials.  Under component\n            (c) a coordinated system for teacher supply and distribution\n            will be established by setting up a tracking system to\n            facilitate decision-making concerning trainees and\n            recruitment efforts.  Component (d) will provide for the\n            development of R&D capacity among primary teacher\n            educators for research directed towards the improvement of\n            the effectiveness of primary teacher education and related\n            issues.
