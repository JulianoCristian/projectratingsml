As such, Regional Blood\n            Transfusion Centers (RBTCs) will be developed at Hanoi, Ho\n            Chi Minh City, Hue and Can Tho, which should serve\n            provincial and district hospitals as well. The subcomponents\n            include: 1) a voluntary donation recruitment program, based\n            on public education campaigns, and organizing blood\n            collection sessions, focused on retaining donors that meet\n            screening standards. Counseling services for blood donors,\n            and management and administrative services will be financed;\n            2) a blood bank operations program shall include activities\n            of transporting, testing, processing, and storing collected\n            blood, to later cross-match and dispose the necessary blood\n            to be used at area hospitals. Records management, and\n            information systems will be established, as will\n            quality-assurance management; 3) an effective clinical use\n            of blood program, will assist in the regular operation of\n            hospital BT committees, and on data collection of BT\n            practices, including feedback on comparative data to\n            practitioners, while training on clinical use of blood will\n            be provided; 4) a quality management program will prepare a\n            five year plan (2002-06) to develop BT services, monitor BT\n            operations, conduct epidemiological and clinical studies\n            related to BT medicine, and develop annual assessments of BT\n            services; 5) a RBTC staff development program will recruit,\n            train, and retain core staff, and, the facility and\n            logistics management program will plan, and improve RBTC\n            physical facilities. Resettlement and compensation costs\n            will be financed for affected populations in the Can Tho\n            Province. Assistance will be provided to the National\n            Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion to support\n            technical, operational, and policy matters, as well as for\n            capacity building inputs."}, "docdt": "2002-03-18T00:00:00Z"}
