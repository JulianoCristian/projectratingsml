development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            for project supported civil work, it is essential to obtain\n            land clearance of the construction site before the project\n            starts. The project provided a good lesson on why it is\n            important to have a well prepared construction site before\n            approval. It required a lot of efforts to get through\n            Government procedures to deal with land clearance and\n            authorization. Bank policy on social safeguards should be\n            strictly followed during project preparation and\n            implementation. The project provided a very good example of\n            the close relationship with and support to the\n            implementation of the national program. The project\n            activities were designed very much in line with the\n            Government priorities so that project outcomes directly\n            contributed to the improvement of the Government system.\n            Especially in a country as dynamic as Vietnam, it was\n            important to adopt a flexible approach to the project to be\n            able to respond to the important needs of the client when\n            needed and where they were consistent with the key\n            development objective of the project. Project design should\n            be less complex to facilitate implementation. Flexible and\n            in time solutions to tackle emergent issues and difficulties\n            during the implementation are essential to make the project move."}, "docdt": "2010-03-26T00:00:00Z"}
