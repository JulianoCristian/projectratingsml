{"cdata!": "In order to meet the increase in local\n            demand for electricity through 1990, Tanzania is undertaking\n            this Fourth Power Project.  The venture will develop\n            renewable energy resources, new job opportunities as well as\n            supplying power to isolated areas.  In addition, it will\n            replace production from diesel sets, thus providing\n            substantial foreign exchange savings as well as laying the\n            basis for improved power sector coordination, tariff policy,\n            power system control and load dispatching practices.  A\n            further objective of the project is to maintain and further\n            improve Tanesco's operations through support of its\n            training and management programs.  Specifically, the project\n            components include: (a) construction of a water intake; a\n            headrace tunnel as well as a vertical penstock system\n            leading to an underground powerhouse; a tailrace tunnel; a\n            switchyard; and ancillary buildings.  The project will also\n            include: (b) construction of a system control center at Dar\n            es Salaam; (c) rehabilitation of the existing Ubongo diesel\n            station and other power system facilities.  Funds are also\n            intended for: (d) training and management programmes; and\n            finally for (e) consultancy services."}, "docdt": "1983-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
