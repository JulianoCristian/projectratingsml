Its\n            principal objectives are to improve environmental conditions\n            and public health, establish an institution and sound\n            financial policies for the operation and management of the\n            Jakarta sewerage system, and demonstrate the feasibility of\n            appropriate low-cost technologies. The project would cover\n            sewerage and sanitation improvements including: (a) a basic\n            water-borne sewerage system; (b) drainage improvements; (c)\n            sanitation improvements; (d) consulting services for project\n            implementation, for technical, institutional and financial\n            studies, and the preparation of future projects; and (e) training."}, "docdt": "1983-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
