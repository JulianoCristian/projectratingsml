         unsatisfactory.\" The lessons learned from this project\n            include: 1) Successive single tranche operations would have\n            been preferable to one comprehensive two-tranche operation.\n            It would have avoided the need for the very difficult\n            decisions required as each new closure date loomed, on\n            whether partial implementation progress justified extension\n            or cancellation. 2) Generating early positive results are\n            necessary for political sustainability. This requires early\n            attention to measures aimed at building supportive laws and\n            organizations that improve market responses to reform. 3)\n            Generating early, positive results also requires rapid,\n            efficient implementation. 4) The Ministry of Agriculture and\n            Food saw this project as all pain and no gain. Adjustment\n            loans bring foreign exchange to the Ministry of Finance, but\n            typically bring little in the way of tangible support to\n            line ministries. 5) The Romania Agricultural Sector\n            Adjustment Loan Project, at $350 million, was too large. The\n            loan was excessive in relation to the conditions and to the\n            economic importance of the agriculture sector. It induced a\n            strong effort to obtain tranche release without any\n            compensating increase in genuine commitment to reform\n            through a steady and sustained effort."}, "docdt": "2001-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
