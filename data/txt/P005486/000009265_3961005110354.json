will assist Morocco and the\n            Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole (CNCA) to consolidate\n            and deepen the institutional reform process and to develop\n            the sustainable foundations of a financially sound rural\n            finance system well-integrated into a gradually liberalized\n            financial sector.  The project will help:  (a) achieve a key\n            transition in CNCA's institutional development by\n            supporting CNCA's conversion to a more diversified bank\n            with increased managerial autonomy, geared to serve\n            agriculture and to reach small farmers, young\n            entrepreneurs/graduates and non-farm clients (notably women)\n            in poverty-related areas; (b) promote private investment in\n            viable projects, including agro-industries with export\n            potential; (c) increase domestic resource mobilization and\n            secure the rural banking system through a pilot drought\n            relief fund/crop insurance system drawing on best practices\n            worldwide; and (d) develop banking and technical skills\n            needed to manage the changed organization and special\n            features of a sustainable rural finance operation.\n            Specifically, the project will fund:  (a) medium- and\n            long-term credit to private farmers and investors to finance\n            a wide range of investments including water conservation\n            measures in irrigation, farm equipment, tree crop and\n            livestock development, storage facilities, land improvement,\n            greenhouses, agro-processing plants, coastal fisheries,\n            rural housing, forestry and environment protection, and\n            rural non-farm investments; and (b) project-related\n            training, consulting services for the strengthening of CNCA\n            management and planning and to manage the effects of\n            drought.  A mid-term review will assess progress made during implementation."}, "docdt": "1993-10-29T00:00:00Z"}
