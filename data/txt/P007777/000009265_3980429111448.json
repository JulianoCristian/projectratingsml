The objectives of the program\n            aim to: 1) carry out a major reform of the state banking\n            sector; 2) improve financial intermediation, especially in\n            rural areas; and 3) improve the regulatory framework for\n            private banking. In order to achieve these objectives, the\n            FSAC project will support measures to: 1) maintain a stable\n            macroeconomic framework; 2) restructure the state banking\n            system, including the closure of one state bank and the\n            capitalization by private investors of another state bank;\n            3) foster private banking presence in the rural and\n            agricultural sectors; and 4) strengthen the regulatory\n            framework for, and supervision of, private banking. These\n            measures will allow the Government of Nicaragua to address\n            major obstacles to sustainable private sector led growth and\n            mobilize additional balance of payments support."}, "docdt": "1998-04-09T00:00:00Z"}
