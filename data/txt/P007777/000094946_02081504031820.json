Overall\n            performances by the Bank and the Borrower are considered\n            satisfactory. Lessons learned with regard to state bank\n            privatization include the following: Successful\n            privatization of state banks is possible even in a very\n            difficult environment. Sequential auction of individual\n            branches, as occurred with the National Development Bank\n            (BANADES), is an approach that allows privatization of a\n            large state bank while ensuring continuity of service. The\n            sale of 100 percent of the state bank should be sought.\n            Retaining partial state ownership can limit the probability\n            of attracting a high-quality buyer and may weaken the\n            bank's post-privatization performance. Once the\n            decision to privatize a bank has been adopted, the\n            day-to-day management should be replaced by a competent\n            transitional management or very closely supervised by\n            independent parties. The quality of the buyer is the most\n            important element to ensure a good post-privatization\n            outcome. Pre-qualification requirements should restrict\n            participation to well capitalized and experienced banks. A\n            management contract with a bank is a poor substitute for\n            sale of ownership. Intensive IDA involvement in supervising\n            the process is needed, particularly in a setting with weak\n            governance institutions. Loan proceeds should be disbursed\n            only after careful review of the privatization transaction."}, "docdt": "2002-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
