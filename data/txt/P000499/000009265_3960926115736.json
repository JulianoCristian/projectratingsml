Project activities will include\n            : (a) development of traditional groupings into pastoral\n            associations, and rehabilitation of water points within the\n            framework of these associations; (b) strengthening of input\n            supply systems; (c) strengthening of rangeland and\n            crop/livestock research; (d) introduction of more efficient\n            extension methods in MEHP's field services, and\n            rehabilitation of their facilities; and (e) strengthening of\n            MEHP's capability for planning and coordination."}, "docdt": "1988-04-22T00:00:00Z"}
