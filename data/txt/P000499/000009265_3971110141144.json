satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: some\n            degree of decentralization, through organization of the\n            herders, was possible in a highly centralized administrative\n            setting. Integrating the project into the Ministry's\n            structural organization proved to be a sound strategy and\n            hence there is the need to tailor the design of projects of\n            this kind to local capacities. Donor coordination and unity\n            are essential and decisive to continued execution of reforms\n            initiated. Frequent changes in the project agency, lack of\n            continuity in key posts, poor matching of external training\n            to the positions to be filled, and interference by the\n            Ministry in project management, can hamper project implementation."}, "docdt": "1997-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
