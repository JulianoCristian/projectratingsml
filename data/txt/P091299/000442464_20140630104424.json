satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            community engagement in project design during preparation\n            and implementation helps ensure relevance and builds\n            community capacity. One of the main implementation and\n            sustainability challenges the project faced was attaining\n            the service providers\u0092 commitment to assume responsibility\n            for the works and to provide service to the areas. The\n            service providers were reluctant to enter the communities\n            based on internal financial and technical constraints as\n            well as the communities\u0092 low capacity to pay for services.\n            The sectionalized approach caused tension within the\n            communities given that at times houses along one side of the\n            road were receiving access to a new service and houses on\n            the other side of were not. Community members and Jamaica\n            social investment fund (JSIF) highlighted the importance of\n            increasing sensitivity to the issue in future projects to\n            limit community conflict. The Government of Jamaica (GoJ)\n            sought the Bank\u0092s assistance with innovative, multi sector\n            project given successful past experience working together.\n            The Bank had the confidence to finance a highly ambitious\n            project given JSIF\u0092s demonstrated capacity to implement.\n            Ensuring monitoring and evaluation (M and E) approach takes\n            into account latest best practices as well as local context."}, "docdt": "2014-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
