1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.      At inception, the Inner City Basic Services for the Poor (ICBSP) Project offered a then-
innovative multi-sector design that integrated investments in small-scale infrastructure with
interventions to reduce risk factors for crime and violence. The Project was prepared from 2004 to 2006,
approved by the World Bank Board on March 29, 2006 and declared effective on June 27, 2006. The
original closing date of the Project was December 31, 2011. The Project was restructured in July 2011 in
order to extend the closing by two years to December 31, 2013.

1.2. Context at Appraisal

2.     Country and sector issues. At the time of Project preparation and appraisal, the Jamaican
economy was undergoing a structural shift: manufacturing, which had dominated the economy since the
1960s was declining, whereas the service industry, specifically tourism, was increasing its share of the
economy. Urban centers, such as Kingston, saw business and industrial activities -- including associated
urban employment opportunities -- migrate to the urban periphery. This transition particularly impacted
under-educated, inner-city 6 residents who did not have the skill sets required to find alternative
employment. Increasing unemployment rates in the inner cities correlated with an increase of crime. At
appraisal, Jamaica reported one of the highest homicide rates in the world. 7 In 2005, homicides reached
a record high of 1,650, or 60.4 homicides per 100,000 people, with the majority of the violence
concentrated in the inner cities.

3.      The inner city communities’ physical characteristics enabled criminal activity to flourish; for
example, roads were in poor condition making access for police, service providers and taxis difficult,
houses were encircled by zinc fences, limiting the number of “eyes on the road”, 8 and street lighting was
minimal. The ability of service providers such as the National Solid Waste Management Authority
(NSWMA) and the National Water Commission (NWC) to access these inner city communities was
hampered by poor infrastructure and outbreaks of violence. At the time of appraisal, exact data on the
state of service provision in the inner cities was limited, but an analysis of aggregate data and studies
suggested that service coverage and quality was poor and that there were pockets of extreme
deprivation. For example, sewerage systems in many inner city communities 9 did not exist or were in
need of major repair, and solid waste collection was irregular. 10 Overall, the presence of the state was
minimal. This environment enabled gangs to maintain control over many of the communities.

4.     High rates of crime and violence also limited human and social capital development. Inner city
residents had limited access to training, employment, and capital resources that would enable them to

  In Jamaica, inner cities are characterized by decaying physical infrastructure, poor service provision, high population densities, and
environmental hazards. The term is assigned to communities in or bordering urban centers as well as communities on the periphery of
towns that suffer from similar lack of access to services and social fragmentation (Project Appraisal Document).

  Zinc fencing also has implications for community cohesiveness (i.e. one can’t interact with one’s neighbor), may jut out into the road,
further preventing vehicle and pedestrian access; and also doesn’t stop bullets – criminals may shoot through zinc fencing at the police
without being seen and residents may have bullets pass through their fencing, into their homes (JSIF).

poor-quality secondary institutions, including those that end at Grade Nine. The lack of state investment
and opportunities to earn a livelihood through traditional employment created an environment ripe for
increased criminal activity.

of broader society, the Government of Jamaica (GoJ) prioritized community development and crime and
violence reduction. In 1996, the GoJ established the Jamaica Social Investment Fund (JSIF) as a quasi-
government agency with a mandate to reduce poverty and create an environment for sustainable
development. In 2000, the Prime Minister of Jamaica established a committee of senior officials to
oversee and coordinate all inner-city renewal interventions. In 2002, the GoJ designed a Community
Renewal Program (CRP) that aimed to provide a framework for integrating human, social, economic and
environmental development in the inner cities.


6.      Rationale for Bank involvement. In response to the spike in violence in Jamaica, the GoJ began
investigating innovative ways to promote peace in the inner cities. Prior to the Jamaica Inner City Basic
Service for the Poor (ICBSP) Project, the GoJ had largely approached violence through increasing
police presence or utilizing armed forces. The Minister of Finance was interested in implementing an
innovative approach that combined infrastructure investment with community-based interventions and
sought the Bank’s assistance.

7.     The Bank was well positioned to support the Project given its experience working with JSIF
through the National Community Development Project (P076837, NCDP), which aimed to provide basic
services and promote temporary employment opportunities in Jamaica’s poorest communities, the
Bank’s significant background in integrated urban upgrading projects and its growing expertise in crime
and violence prevention. In addition, the Project was closely in line with the World Bank’s Jamaica
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), 12 which focused on three pillars: (i) accelerating inclusive
economic growth; (ii) improving human development and opportunity; and (iii) crime prevention and
reduction


1.2 Original Project/Program Development Objective (PDO) and Key Indicators

8.      Project Development Objective. The PDO was to improve the quality of life in twelve of the
Borrower’s inner city areas and poor urban informal settlements by improving access to basic urban
infrastructure, financial services, land tenure regularization, and enhanced public safety and community
capacity.

9.      Key indicators The PDO outcome indicators are: (i) provide access to improved basic
infrastructure and financial services and security of tenure for 60,000 inner city residents; and (ii)
percent of beneficiaries who feel safe or very safe. The Project also had 16 intermediate outcome
indicators at the time of appraisal.

10.    Neither the PDO nor its PDO-level indicators were revised. The intermediate indicators were
revised given their reliance on survey data, which presented data collection challenges, including faulty
design of initial baseline survey and respondent fatigue. The intermediate indicators are detailed in the
Data Sheet.

1.4 Beneficiaries

11.     The Project’s target beneficiaries were the 60,000 poor and vulnerable people living in the 12
selected inner-city communities. The Project aimed to benefit these inner city residents through: (i)
increasing access and improving the quality of water, sanitation, solid waste collection, electricity,
roads, drainage and related community infrastructure; (ii) increasing access to micro-finance; (iii)
promoting land tenure; and (iv) enhancing public safety. The Project also aimed to build community
capability and social cohesion through technical assistance, training and workshops.

1.5 Original Components

12.    The Project’s original components are as follows:

Component 1. Access to Services
1.1. Community Basic Infrastructure

connections; (iii) construction of multi-purpose, community centers in seven of the Project
Communities; and (iv) enhancement of basic infrastructure through community-based subprojects
(“Community-based Subprojects”), implemented by registered legal entities of the corresponding
Project Communities, including extension of household water and sanitation connections, removal and
substitution of zinc fencing, improvement of neighborhood and recreational facilities, and installation of
community garbage receptacles.
(b) Improvement of solid waste collection systems in Project Communities through the provision of
technical assistance and the procurement of solid waste collection equipment and compactor trucks.
(c) Rehabilitation and construction of offsite network infrastructure necessary for the maintenance of

assistance, training, basic computer equipment and office supplies.
1.2. Access to Financial Services
(a) Facilitating of access to micro-financial services within the Project Communities for use towards
developing and promoting small and medium-sized businesses and incremental housing improvements,
through the provision of performance-based service contracts to financial institutions that will offer to

                                                                                                           12
beneficiaries within Project Communities, micro-financial services and technical assistance in areas
including credit counseling, business plan preparation, financial management and related business
support.

1.2(a) above, and training of Project Implementing Entity staff to evaluate bids and monitor and evaluate
micro-financing activities.
(c) Carrying out of independent technical audits of the loan portfolios of the financial institutions
contracted under Part 1.2(a) above.

1.3. Land Tenure Regularization
(a) Carrying out of: (i) a cadastral audit of all Project Communities, consisting of approximately
13,000 parcels of land; and (ii) an assessment of the number of parcels eligible for titling.
(b) Development of a land titling and strategy program, including: (i) design and implementation of
informational campaigns and public consultations; and (ii) examination of the field, legal and
administrative procedures and costs required for the transferring of titles.
(c) Provision of technical assistance to the Borrower for the development of a broader land tenure
regularization policy and program for urban and peri-urban squatter areas.
(d) Implementation of a land titling program on public lands in the Project Communities, including:

assistance in areas related to crime and violence prevention, including: (a) mediation and conflict
resolution; (b) alternative livelihoods and skills development; (c) family support programs; (d) youth
education and recreation programs;(e) community- based organization capacity building, including the
assignment of community liaison officers to serve as full-time community facilitators in each Project
Community; and (f) social marketing and public awareness campaigns.

Component 3. Project Management
3.1. Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation
      Building of capacity of the Project Implementing Entity through the provision of:(a) technical

                                                                                                          13
basic office supplies, maintenance of motor vehicles, and travel, per diem and salaries of administrative
staff.

Revised Components

13.      In November 2013, the Project underwent a level two restructuring to reallocate loan proceeds
and scale down sub-component 1.1, Integrated Network Infrastructure, sub-component 1.2, Access to
Financial services, and sub-component 1.3, Land Tenure Regularization. The funds were used to scale-
up sub-component I.1 (A) III Community Centers, given significant construction cost increases since
preparation, and Component 2, Public Safety Enhancement, given its high level of success and
community demand for the activities under this component. These adjustments are discussed in further
detail in the Implementation Section.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

14.     Comprehensive background analysis. The Bank design team performed a comprehensive
background analysis that included incorporating lessons learned from the NCDP Project, World Bank
projects from across the globe (e.g., how zinc fence removal contributed to increased citizen security in
South Africa) and Bank best practices (e.g., inclusion of an impact evaluation) in the Project’s design.
Prior to the Project’s start, JSIF, the Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ), the Ministry of National
Security (MNS), and the Social Development Commission (SDC) conducted a thorough community
selection process – independent of Bank involvement – based on geographic location (the design sought
to include all parishes with major urban centers), poverty rates, access to water, and crime levels. The
political affiliations of the 12 communities were also considered to ensure support for the Project
through political turnover; the two dominant political parties were equally represented in the selected
communities. 13 Given the size restraints of the Project and the desire to have a wide reach, the Project
targeted sections of these communities as opposed to the entire communities.

15.     Strong Community Buy-in. With the exception of the design decision to focus on sections of
communities, which resulted in tension between community beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries, the
Project design fostered community buy-in. During preparation, JSIF engaged in an extensive process of
consultation with the residents of the 12-targeted areas of the selected communities (from here forward
referred to as the communities). Four phases of consultation, whose results guided the design of the
Project’s initial activities, took place during preparation: (i) public awareness-building, diagnosis and
needs assessment; 14 (ii) an assessment of current community environments and infrastructure needs with
community stakeholders; (iii) infrastructure planning focus groups; and (iv) focus group discussions on
potential designs for integrated neighborhood plans. JSIF met with over 1,000 community members

13
  The communities were selected based on the following quantitative measures: percent of households in the community in the lowest
poverty quintile and the percent of households without access to piped water and the following qualitative measures: one community from
each of the five parishes with big city, balanced political party allegiance, and high priority based on the MNS’ public safety criteria.
14
  JSIF has a comprehensive social screening process in place for projects financed by ICBSP and other sources. This process includes a
review of the demographic and social characteristics of the beneficiaries, the capacity and status of the community based organization
responsible for the project, participation by community members in needs identification, potential employment impact, and the accessibility
of the project to people with disabilities. These topics are captured in the social appraisal report prepared by the social officer (with
technical officer input) following multiple field visits. This report then becomes the basis for subsequent reviews within JSIF.
                                                                                                                                       14
through over 120 formal meetings and focus groups. To ensure continued relevance throughout
implementation, activities were adjusted based on community demand on an annual basis. In the
December 2013, Citizen Report Card 15 Survey, 84 percent of respondents answered “yes” when asked,
“Do you believe the best projects were chosen for the community?”

16.     Broad PDO. The Project’s PDO to “improve the quality of life” in the twelve selected
communities “through improving access to basic urban infrastructure, financial services, land tenure
regularization, and enhanced public safety and community capacity” captured all of the Project’s
activities. Nevertheless, the PDO could have been strengthened through maintaining focus on the core
objectives - improving the sense of public safety, building community capacity to participate in the
formal economy and improving access to basic services. While improving the quality of life
encompassed the ultimate objectives of the Project, its enormous breadth and consequent vagueness as
an objective (difficulty to measure), limited its capacity to orient, guide, and direct the Project.

17.     Complex Breadth of Activities Strained Implementation The Project was designed to be
comprehensive, but the number of activities (over 30) and entities involved (five government agencies,
parish councils, community committees and civic organizations among others 16) in implementation
added complexity and stretched financial and human resources thin. JSIF had past experience
implementing World Bank projects and a high capacity to implement social capacity building projects,
but lacked staff with technical expertise in micro-finance and land titling. Another capacity limitation
that was not fully explored in the design was the ability and willingness of the service providers to fully
engage in the Project’s implementation and assume responsibility for the works financed through the
Project. JSIF’s political pull to motivate action on the part of the service providers was weak, and
beyond the MoUs, the service providers had limited incentive to actively engage.

18.    A Model for a Multi-Sector Approach to Address Risk Factors for Crime and Violence in
Jamaica. The Project’s fusion of small-scale infrastructure and community-based social interventions
was innovative for the World Bank and JSIF at the time of design. Many public service agencies were
not entering the communities because of the high levels of crime and violence and the difficulty
associated with collecting tariffs. The Project’s design proposed a solution to this hurdle through
focusing on measures that would visibly increase safety in the neighborhoods. In addition, the Project
design sought to facilitate the communication channel between the agencies and the residents to build
confidence between the groups. The Project also included performance-based mechanisms for micro-
finance, which was cutting edge for both the Bank and JSIF.

19.     Utilizing Borrower’s System for Environmental and Social Safeguard Management. In an
innovative move, the Project utilized the Borrower’s systems for safeguard implementation (O.P. 4.00
Piloting the Use of Borrower Systems to Address Environmental and Social Safeguard Issues in Bank-
Supported Projects). An Equivalence and Acceptability Assessment was carried out by the Bank team.
To fill identified gaps, JSIF developed an Environmental Management Framework and a Land

  Citizen report cards are “participatory surveys that provide quantitative feedback on user perceptions on the quality, adequacy and
efficiency of public services.”

participate in the report card survey.
16
  Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) were signed with all of these agencies (National Water Council, National Solid Waster
Management Authority, Rural Electrification Program, Jamaica Public Sevices Company, Ltd. and the Parish councils) during preparation.
The ICBSP Project also had strategic partnerships with: the Benevolent Society, the University of Technology, the National Works
Association, RADA, National Environmental Planning Agency, Sandals Resorts, Social Development Commission, JN Small Business,
and HEART Trust/NTA among others.
                                                                                                                                   15
Acquisition and Resettlement Policy Framework that were integrated into the operational manual and
became standard policy for all JSIF-funded projects.

20.    Solid internal fiduciary capacity with external obstacles. JSIF’s past experience
implementing Bank projects revealed substantial capacity for managing financial and procurement17
aspects of implementation. The Project design could have further evaluated external procurement issues,
such as the low willingness of firms to enter communities because of violence (and the subsequent risk
premiums charged), the exclusion of many local firms from international bidding processes given little
or no experience implementing contracts of over US$1.5 million 18 as well as the extended timeline
associated with the required cabinet approval for all bids over approximately US$400,000. 19

21.      High level of Government commitment. The GoJ illustrated a high level of commitment to the
Project during preparation. The Ministry of Finance requested the Bank’s support to prepare a project
that integrated infrastructure with crime and violence prevention. Jamaica was suffering from a spike in
violence and prevention was at the top of the national agenda. The Project was closely in line with the
GoJ’s high-level objectives to improve the living situation and reduce violence in the inner cities. In
illustration of the high level of commitment, by Project approval JSIF had 18 months of bidding
documents prepared by Project approval.

22.     Underestimation of Inter-Institutional Risks. For the most part, the design team identified the
main risks to Project implementation and proposed concrete, highly implementable mitigation measures
that were integrated in the Project’s activities. For instance, given the moderate risk for environmental
management, the Project supported the implementation of the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO) 14000 Environmental Management Certification. The certification process helps
organizations develop and utilize tools to identify potential and control actual environmental impacts to
improve environmental performance. The risk that violence would halt implementation was mitigated by
a host of short and medium term initiatives, including public safety sensitive infrastructure planning,
mediation initiatives and job training and skills development, targeting vulnerable groups. The risk that
partner, service-provider agencies would not have the capacity or commitment to extend service to these
areas, however, was underestimated. The mitigation measures were highly implementable (in addition to
establishing and signing MoUs with the service providers, the Project proposed financing tools, such as
a waste pick-up truck for the NSWMA, and works in line with the agencies’ strategic growth plans to
build commitment), but they did not build vested interest from the service providers to ensure their
commitment.

Implementation

23.     The Project’s ambitious multi-sector design, the Jamaican economic crisis and the difficult
procurement environment led to initial delays in implementation (only 10 percent of the loan had been
disbursed after two years of implementation), but JSIF’s high implementation capacity and the Project’s
flexible design enabled the Project to overcome these challenges and successfully meet its objectives.



17
   The Procurement Capacity Assessment conducted at the time of appraisal rated JSIF’s capacity as ‘average’ and noted an increased
capacity to manage a larger project load.
18
     To involve local firms, JSIF broke contracts into smaller segments, slowing overall contracting processes and complicating supervision.
19
     The threshold is currently JMD40 million, which was raised during the life of the Project from the previous threshold of JMD30 million.
                                                                                                                                          16
24.      Strong Readiness by Implementation Agency. Project implementation benefited from JSIF’s
extensive experience implementing Bank projects as well as its expertise in community interventions.
JSIF’s model of conducting extensive pre-project consultations, introducing contractors to the
community prior to the start of works, utilizing Community Based Contracting (CBC) throughout the
life of the Project, 20 giving community committees 21 the responsibility to monitor and coordinate Project
progress as well as providing consistent hands-on assistance through assigning JSIF Community Liaison
Officers (CLOs) to each community were key to successful implementation. In addition, JSIF had a
recognized brand in the communities that enabled safe physical access to carry out the works. 22

25.     Initial infrastructure design process not well supervised. During implementation, the Project
overcame a series of challenges that delayed progress. First, to ensure an efficient start to
implementation at the outset of the Project, the Bank leveraged a Japan Policy and Human Resources
Development (PHRD) trust fund grant to hire an international consulting firm 23, UK-based HTSPE, to
produce designs for all of the infrastructure works. That firm produced the designs from abroad with
limited knowledge of the terrain and environment in Jamaica and utilized a “one size fits all approach”
even though the communities had a variety of terrains. The designs had significant flaws, such as over-
design with respect to the level of seismic and hurricane risk, which “plagued” the Project throughout
implementation. 24 Project funds had to be diverted to re-design works (over 50 percent of the designs
had to be re-done), causing initial delays in disbursements, delays in overall implementation and an
increase in costs. 25

26.     Complicated contracting environment. Disbursements were also delayed because of the initial
design decision to tender large contracts (that few local contractors could bid on), the reluctance of
contractors to work in the Project’s crime-ridden communities and consequent no-bid contracting
processes, onerous risk premiums in bids, as well as overloading of the few contractors willing to work
in the communities. The increase in costs and delays limited the capacity of the Project to maximize
reach and focus on post-Project sustainability.

27.   Economic upheaval. Another challenge the Project faced was the 2009 to 2010 fiscal crisis.
During the life of the Project, the economy contracted by 4.8 percent and employment fell by 5.7


20
  Within JSIF financed sub-projects, a unique arrangement has been developed to ensure employment benefits from construction works are
maximized and equally shared within the community. This involves the community appointing an employment coordinator to liaise with
the contractor, in sourcing the necessary labor and skills within the community. The employment coordinator also works to resolve disputes
regarding wages and on the rotation of workers every two weeks so that opportunities are shared throughout the community. This has
proved to be a very effective model that should be continued in the second phase of the project
21
  The Project’s community committees have been instrumental in the implementation and maintenance of physical as well as social
interventions. Community engagement guided the placement, use and structures of built environment projects, which incorporated
principles of CPTED and reclaimed public spaces, such as desolate lots, where delinquency and violence were common, into public spaces
for the common good, such as playing field, and community centers, strategically located for outreach and natural surveillance.
22
  In the December 2013 Citizen Report Card survey, 98% of respondents answered yes to the question, “would you welcome the JSIF
team again in your community?”
23
   Given the large size of the contract, an international bidding process was held. Jamaican firms did not have adequate experience
executing contracts of this size, limiting their ability to compete in the bidding process.
24
     Interview with JSIF staff during ICR fact-finding mission (February 18 to 23, 2014)
25
  For example, in Knollis the foundation of the community center had to be adjusted because of base and sub-base soil conditions;
comprehensive soil tests were not reflected in the design. The drainage designs were also fraught with error. For instance, in Flankers, the
design did not sufficiently reflect the underground pipes and cables. In Africa, the slopes of some of the drains went in the wrong direction.
The re-design required resulted in delays and cost increases. Trevor Hamilton & Associates Center for Excellence Impact Evaluation,

                                                                                                                                           17
percent. 26 In response to the economic upheaval in Jamaica, the International Monetary Fund imposed
fiscal targets that required the GoJ to cut public expenditures. The tightening policies led to limited
Project disbursements and delayed contracting of several major infrastructure works in 2009 and 2010.
The GoJ, however, illustrating its commitment to the Project, ensured that the Project had enough funds
to move forward.

28.     Reliance on service providers with limited resources and vested interest. The complex
implementation arrangements also posed implementation challenges. Despite having signed MoUs
guaranteeing service provider commitment to extend services to the Project areas, some public service
providers lacked the financial capacity to extend service into the Project areas and perform routine
maintenance as promised. In addition, service providers were hesitant to extend their services to the
communities given the communities’ low capacity to pay for services. For instance, the NWC
highlighted that people in the target communities illegally tap into the system and that it does not have
the capacity to monitor connections and target payment collections, especially in light of the levels of
violence in the communities. As a result, the service providers did not prioritize service connections in
the target communities. This resulted in delays in the hand-over of works to the service providers. 27

29.     Responsive implementation and supervision. The JSIF and Bank teams adapted the Project to
the changing circumstances to enable successful implementation. For example, during the February
2010 Mid-Term Review (MTR) JSIF and the Bank team recognized the need to reduce the scope of the
micro-finance and land tenure activities. The micro-finance activity had suffered long delays from lack
of interest by microfinance providers as well as hesitation from JSIF Board members to give financial
incentives to private financial institutions. There was also cultural hesitation in the communities towards
accepting a loan. The land tenure activity involved a complicated and time-consuming process with the
Ministry of Housing, and JSIF did not have ample human resources to devote to continuing the process
beyond one community. Funds from these activities were re-allocated to public safety enhancement and
capacity building activities as well as community centers (which had experienced a surge in construction
prices). This re-allocation was formalized in the November 2013 Restructuring.

30.     In response to the fiscal tightening and overall delays in disbursement and procurement, the
Project was formally restructured in July 2011 to extend the closing date by two years to December 31,
2013. The extension enabled the completion of key infrastructure works. During the fiscal crisis, JSIF
and the Bank worked together to pro-actively prioritize feasible investments (smaller scale, capacity
building activities under Component 2 were more feasible to implement during this time given their
relatively low costs) and continue ongoing activities. JSIF and the Bank also continually updated
activities throughout implementation to respond to the operating environment and the priorities of the
communities. For example, given NWSMA’s capacity limitations, the Project incorporated new
approaches to solid waste management that focused on reinforcing community efforts in collection,
cleanup, awareness and neighborhood beautification.

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

31.    Weak M&E at Design. In addition to designing the preliminary infrastructure plans, HTSPE
was responsible for conducting the baseline household survey. HTSPE neglected to properly survey the
four control communities, weakening the capacity of JSIF to measure the overall impact of the Project.

  The NWC has assumed responsibility for all of the water mains the Project supported and has advised JSIF that it intends to connect
households by October 2014. The handover process was completed in May 2014.
                                                                                                                                        18
As it turned out, the control communities would not have served as ideal controls because they were not
isolated from other government and non-governmental organizations’ interventions.

32.     The Project’s two results level indicators – i.e., number of people with access to improved
services and percent of residents who feel safe or very safe -- capture the key results of the Project.
Given the difficulty associated with measuring the direct impact of crime and violence prevention work
in communities (records on crime are not very robust, making crime measurements unreliable), the
Project relied on perception analyses to capture the impact of the Project’s crime and violence
prevention activities. The original 16 intermediate indicators relied heavily on periodic surveys of the
households and proved difficult to implement on a yearly basis given personnel requirements and
respondent fatigue. The Bank and JSIF revised the indicators in 2009, and the resulting intermediate
indicators were straightforward, easy to measure and captured the Project’s key outputs. The M&E
design included various data collection tools, such as focus group discussions, citizen report cards, and a
pre and post-Project household baseline survey and an impact evaluation study. JSIF also had a
management information system in place from the NCDP that was updated for the Project to monitor
material inputs, number of beneficiaries and additional indicators among other data points to promote
efficient and transparent M&E.

33.    Hands-on M&E Implementation. The M&E framework became ingrained in the Project
communities. Community committees collected data, and JSIF’s CLOs verified the data through regular
on-the-ground checks, during sub-project implementation and at the end of every month. In addition,
regular focus groups 28 were conducted and a citizen report card was used in the final year to assess
residents’ satisfaction with the Project. JSIF also prepared semi-annual progress reports to monitor and
evaluate activities. A baseline survey was carried out at the Project’s outset and an impact evaluation
study was carried out after the Project’s completion.

34.      Agile M&E Utilization. The data generated from the M&E process was used to adapt project
activities to each community’s needs on an annual basis. For instance, communities’ high demand for
assistance in obtaining birth certificates resulted in a second phase of “Operation Certification.” JSIF
had an established channel through which indicator information and progress reports were discussed at
various levels of the organization and sent to the Managing Director.

35.     The Project also received a grant from the Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF) to support the
Ministry of National Security (MNS) in building a crime observatory to monitor crime levels throughout
Kingston. At the time of completion of this Project, the observatory was tracking crime and violence
data for four key incidence types in five parishes and was beginning to cross validate the data. The ICR
team was easily able to request and receive information on homicide rates for the Project’s target
communities as well as the control communities. Prior to the development of the observatory, the
government was unable to quantify crime details at the community level and therefore unable to factor
that data into crafting a more effective prevention strategy.

Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

36.    Exemplary Social and Environmental Safeguard Management. In many ways, the social
performance of the Project was exemplary. JSIF fully complied with the provisions of the Land

28
  JSIF organized community focus groups in 2007, 2009 and 2011, as well as during the impact evaluation. JSIF hired consultants to
conduct the focus groups in 2007 and 2011. A JSIF staff member conducted the focus groups in 2009.


                                                                                                                                     19
Acquisition and Resettlement Policy Framework, successfully screening for cases of land acquisition
and preparing abbreviated resettlement action plans acceptable to the Bank. JSIF also conducted the
necessary due diligence regarding donation of land to the Project, ensuring that all land transfers were
properly documented and witnessed and had un-encumbered titles. Beyond issues of land acquisition
and resettlement, the Project successfully implemented a grievance redress system, a system for
maximizing employment on works contracts within the local community, as well as a process to screen
projects for a range of other social impacts, including gender relations. As part of this Project JSIF
received ISO 14001 certification for environmental management; JSIF was the first organization in the
English-speaking Caribbean to receive this certification. In 2013, JSIF was named winner of the 2013
Jamaica Environmental Action Award in the waste management category. JSIF demonstrated highly
satisfactory institutional capacity to manage both environmental and social safeguards.

37.     Financial Management Shortcomings. The main shortcoming was the identification of
undocumented expenditures from 2007 to 2009. JSIF carried out a reconciliation exercise to clarify
these expenditures and identified an overdraft in several infrastructure sub-categories. The Project was
restructured in November 2013 to reallocate funds between Project categories to compensate for the
overdraft. JSIF also experienced high levels of financial management staff turnover during
implementation, which disrupted financial management continuity. In regard to procurement, despite the
many challenges associated with contracting works in the Project, JSIF demonstrated high capacity to
manage procurement processes. In general, procurement activities were carried out in compliance with
arrangements agreed on in the Project financing agreement and the Operations Manual. No major
procurement compliance issues arose during implementation.

Post-Completion Operation / Next Phase

38.     The World Bank Group’s Board recently approved a second phase of the Project, the Integrated
Community Development Project (ICDP, P146460), which aims to maintain the Project’s core focus on
public safety enhancement and improved access to basic services in inner cities. The ICDP focuses on
18 different communities but includes activities to enhance service providers’ capacity to operate in
inner city communities. The ICDP will also continue to support the development of the crime
observatory. GoJ programs, such as the CRP, and local non-governmental organizations will continue to
operate in the ICBSP’s 12 communities.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: High

39.     The Project’s objectives, design and impact of its implementation responded to Jamaica’s key
inner-city challenges and supported the GoJ’s Medium Term Socio-Economic Framework Plan. The
Project continues to be very relevant today. Inner city violence, poverty rates, access to basic services
and unemployment rates continue to pose challenges to sustainable and inclusive urban growth. Youth
unemployment is particularly high; 33 percent of young (age 15 to 24) women and 25 percent of young
men were unemployed in 2010. The Project also continues to be highly relevant in terms of the GoJ’s
policy priorities. The GoJ developed and is implementing a National Crime Prevention and Community
Safety Strategy, whose first pillar is crime prevention through community development. In addition, the
GoJ launched the CRP, which focuses on enhancing the delivery of government services to 100
vulnerable communities in the most violent parishes through supporting initiatives in the following
                                                                                                       20
priority areas: (i) governance; (ii) youth development; (iii) safety and justice; (iv) socio-economic
development; and (v) social development. Furthermore, the GoJ’s “Vision 2030” highlights the need for
a holistic approach to reducing crime and violence and sustainable urban and rural development.

40.     The structure and implementation arrangements of the Project also still have high levels of
relevance. As mentioned in the Context section, the ICBSP Project represented a change in ethos on how
to approach crime and violence prevention in Jamaica. Given the ICBSP’s successful implementation,
the integrated, two-pronged approach to crime and violence prevention developed in the ICBSP Project
is being extended to new projects in Jamaica and has shaped new crime prevention initiatives. For
instance, the recently approved ICDP Project builds upon the design of the ICBSP Project (incorporating
infrastructure with skill- and capacity-building exercises) and employs very similar implementation
arrangements (JSIF will lead and utilize the same on the ground approach, including CLOs, CBOs,
CBC).

41.     The Project is also still very relevant to the Bank’s strategy. The Jamaica Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) for FY2014 to 2017 (No. 85158-JM) emphasizes promoting more sustainable and
inclusive growth including, among other foci, capacity building to strengthen social and climate
resilience. The strategy scales up successful interventions aimed at protecting the poor, creating
opportunities for the vulnerable, and helping communities to reduce poverty and address crime and
violence. The strategy also places an increased emphasis on helping improve the enabling environment
for private sector development and growth, as part of fostering sustained improvements in shared
prosperity.

42.     The Project directly supported the Bank’s twin goals of promoting shared prosperity (the Project
included an array of activities to build the capacity of community residents to formally participate in the
economy) and eliminating extreme poverty (the Project extended access to basic infrastructure services
to the country’s poorest residents). Given the continued high relevance of the Project’s objectives, the
Bank and JSIF have prepared the Second Phase, ICDP Project. 29

Achievement of Project/Program Development Objectives
Rating: High

43.     The Project surpassed its two outcome-level indicators, providing basic infrastructure services to
61,953 residents 30 in inner city communities and increasing residents’ sense of security in their
communities by 30.6 percent. 31 The Project also achieved its nine intermediate indicators. The Project
was oftentimes the single largest investor in the communities. Prior to the Project, the communities had
minimal or no state presence. The Project’s objective “to improve the quality of life in twelve of the
Borrower’s inner city areas and poor urban informal settlements” was met primarily through improving
access to basic services, enhancing public safety and strengthening community capacity to participate in
the formal economy. Table 1 reflects the combined impact of these activities and illustrates the overall
improvement in the community environment post-Project. The results captured in Table 1 compare the
household baseline survey that was conducted at the outset of the Project with the survey data from the
impact evaluation conducted immediately prior to the Project’s close. The survey captured the responses
of 700 households living in the targeted communities.

45.     Improving access to basic urban infrastructure. The impact of improving access to basic
services was felt far beyond the work itself. As described in the Implementation section, the
communities were involved in the construction of the infrastructure works, generating jobs and
community ownership. CBC was used whenever possible, 32 and the placement of works resulted from
consultations with communities and contemplated Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design
(CPTED). The infrastructure works also helped increase residents’ sense of security and improved
relationships with state agencies.

46.     The paving of roads (22.30 km total) in the communities enabled greater economic activity, 33
solid waste collection, and taxi and fire truck access among other benefits. The strategic placement of
skips and drums (30 in total) 34 in the communities and the provision of a collection truck enabled
regular solid waste pick-up. Prior to the Project, solid waste collection was not taking place consistently
given the NSWMA’s hesitance to enter the communities because of violence, poor roads, the lack of
skips and the lack of trucks to service the communities. To compensate, materials were oftentimes
burned, posing environmental risks. 35 The construction of water mains and rehabilitation of the sewer
network enabled new or improved access for 3,576 and 478 households respectively. Prior to the
Project, most residents had access to debilitated water mains. The NWC had not maintained its formal
operations in many of these communities given the level of violence and the difficulties associated with
payment collection. As of this writing, all the households are still pending connection to the networks
and four of the five improved sewage pipelines are pending activation; connecting households to the
systems and activating sewage pipelines is a responsibility of the NWC and outside JSIF’s control.

47.     The Project also engaged in smaller-scale infrastructure adjustments to enhance citizens’ sense of
security on the street. Prior to the Project, tall, non-porous zinc fences encircled homes, which inhibited
the number of community members’ “eyes on the road.” Adopting a lesson learned from projects in
South Africa, the Project supported a community initiative to remove zinc fences and build block walls


32
  Over 40 contracts, including four works contracts, were carried out using the CBC methodology. Over US$340,000 was received as in
cash and in kind community contribution for all ICBSP subprojects over the course of the ICBSP.
33
     JSIF anecdotal evidence: the presence of paved roads led to an increase of non-community residents at local businesses.
34
  Due to the narrowness of community streets and the lack of suitable locations (in terms of proximity to community residences and
businesses), the number of skip sites had to be reduced from 50 to 30; the placement of the skips was decided upon through consultations
with both the communities and the NSWMA.
35
 The Project supported an environmental warden program in which community members were trained and given the right to fine people
who liter.
                                                                                                                                       22
of lower height. Over 13,000 residents 36 benefited from this initiative. In addition, to improve the
physical environment, the Project supported the construction of sports fields and five community centers
that included offices for the community committees, rental spaces for small businesses as well as a hall
for community wide-events. 37

48.     Given the Project’s limited financial and human resource and expansive scope, the goal of
involving the NWC, NWSMA, JPS Co, Ltd. and other state agencies was not to extend access to 100
percent of the community members, but to re-introduce the state’s presence in the communities. As a
JSIF staff member commented, the Project could have solely been focused on water, drainage, roads, or
electricity given the enormous quantity of work pending in these communities. The Project took the first
step towards laying the groundwork for improved and continued services through re-introducing the
service agencies, enhancing access and improving public safety.

50.      Enhancing public safety. The Project took a two-pronged approach to promoting security –
investing in physical improvements that fostered security (described above) and enhancing community
capacity to prevent crime and violence. The Project supported numerous capacity building exercises,
including a series of mediation and conflict resolution programs, family support programs, mentorship
activities, summer camps, sports programs and parental training among others (See Annex II for more
detail). Cumulative participation reached 37,140, 38 far surpassing the Project’s target of training 3,270
residents. These community capacity training activities improved community members’ perception of
safety in the neighborhoods. Given that this Project was the first of its kind in Jamaica and that there was
no baseline information for the control communities, the ICR team was unable to identify precise
objective measures from which to compare the relative effectiveness of the capacity enhancement
activities. Nevertheless, the percentage improvements in the communities demonstrate that the Project
positively impacted community members’ perception of public safety.

52.     Strengthening community capacity to participate in the formal economy. The Project
supported an array of education and employment programs, including GSAT classes, recreational
activities, homework classes, remedial education, youth engagement, computer training, apprenticeship
training among others, that promoted residents’ active involvement in Jamaica’s formal society and
integration in the economy (See Annex II for more detail). Cumulative participation reached 32,691, 39
far surpassing the Project’s target of training 4,785 residents. As a result of the training courses, 815
residents obtained certificates affirming their expertise and 91 residents received full-time employment
offers. The Project also supported 91 trainings for parish councils and CBOs, surpassing the Project’s
target of 20 training sessions.

54.     At appraisal, two approaches were used to evaluate the investment: (a) a cost benefit analysis for
water and sewerage that used willingness to pay to estimate the benefits; and (b) a cost effectiveness
analysis for all other interventions. The cost effectiveness analysis was completed with a “reverse”
economic analysis, in which willingness to pay at a 12 percent economic rate of return was estimated.
Results showed that: (a) water and sewerage interventions were expected to be economically viable; and
(b) the least-cost alternative was selected for each of the interventions.

55.     For this evaluation two approaches were used as well: (a) a cost benefit analysis for interventions
on road, education, and training; and (b) a comparison of the results of cost effectiveness approach at
appraisal to actual costs for all interventions. To compare the results at appraisal and at closing, actual
costs in nominal prices were transformed to 2006 prices taking out the effect of inflation and exchange
rate fluctuation. The cost benefit analysis for water and sewerage analysis was not used for the closing
evaluation given that the households are still pending connection to the system.

56.    Results of the cost benefit analysis show that interventions on roads, education and training
yielded returns of 12, 16, and 39 percent 40 respectively.

57.     Results of the comparison analysis of expected to actual costs show that interventions had higher
impacts than expected at appraisal, positively affecting the socio-economic development of the inner
city areas where investments were made. This conclusion is drawn from three facts: (a) real costs of
interventions (at 2006 prices) were 24 percent lower than foreseen at appraisal; (b) the number of actual
beneficiaries (about 62 thousand) was 3 percent higher than expected (60 thousand) bringing the unit
cost per beneficiary 27 percent down; and (c) the Project achieved its two PDO-level results indicators.

58.     Although the Project generated positive economic benefits and was executed more efficiently
than had been foreseen at appraisal, there were minor efficiency shortcomings. Namely, the Project did
not accrue benefits from the water and sewerage household connections during the lifetime of the
Project as originally anticipated in the cost benefit analysis. The cost benefit analysis’ original design,
however, was overly ambitious given that connecting households to the network fell outside JSIF’s
responsibility.

   The return on training was calculated by projecting the earnings (over ten years) of the community members who obtained jobs after
participating in the certificate programs. The analysis assumed that 77 percent of the salaries for the target ICBSP beneficiaries consists of
external leakages and transfer payments The Project can also not take full credit for the attainment of these jobs given that variables outside
the scope of the Project undeniably assisted or limited the job attainment rate. The employed community members may also not retain the
jobs for the projected ten-year period.

Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

60.     Screening to Promote Gender Parity. One of the topics addressed through the social screening
process was an analysis of the Project’s impact on gender relations. During the social screening process,
social officers recorded how many men and women participated in project planning meetings. Social
officers and members of the Project sought to promote the role of women as workers in construction
contracts, challenging women’s traditional role in the workplace. Prior to the approval of each sub-
project, a gender breakdown of identified beneficiaries was provided. Although construction-related
work is traditionally seen as a “male” activity in Jamaica, women were successfully hired on ICBSP
construction sites. To accomplish this, JSIF used a community employment liaison and stressed the need
for gender parity among those employed (both to the employment liaison and to the wider community,
most significantly during subproject information meetings). Contractors also received gender-
sensitization training.

61.    Gender-Specific Interventions In Jamaica, female-headed families tend to be poorer and have
more women and children as part of the household. With this in mind, the Project piloted the Bridge
Jamaica program in partnership with the Ministry of Labor and Social Security and other agencies. The
Bridge Jamaica program provided focused social services to ten female-headed families over the course
of two years. The program also facilitated a Bridge Jamaica teen club (23 members in May 2011), which
successfully worked to build resilience of the program’s teenagers to manage a range of risks, including
teenage pregnancy. 41 JSIF has expanded on this pilot version and is currently carrying out the Bridge
program with 28 families outside the Project’s communities.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

62.     Increased Capacity to Identify Crime-Prone Areas. The crime observatory, which is housed
in the MNS, is beginning to supply the GoJ and agencies such as JSIF with quantitative, community-
specific information on homicide levels. The crime observatory is still in its initial phase but will help
the GoJ target investments towards communities with high levels of crime. The Statistical Institute of
Jamaica, which undertakes censuses and other in-field demographic data collection, and the SDC, which
also undertakes in-field demographic data collection and creates community profiles, are conducting a
boundary rectification process. The boundaries formerly used by PIOJ and the SDC for the communities
differ. In addition to supporting the ‘formalization’ of these communities, the established boundaries
will help service providers, police and other government and non-government entities coordinate their
services and interventions.

63.     Increased Community Committee Capacity. The community committees have also been
strengthened through their high level of involvement in coordinating and supervising implementation of
various community infrastructure projects as well as their involvement in the Project’s various
community programs. The community centers have provided formal office space for the committees as
well as a potential future income source through space rentals for events and leased space for
community businesses (e.g. a hair salon owned by a community resident).

64.     Strengthened Country Systems Capacity with respect to Safeguards. As part of the Project,
JSIF became the first organization in the English-speaking Caribbean to receive an ISO 14001:2004
certification. JSIF’s ISO certified environmental management systems helped instill a culture of
environmentally positive practices. Approximately eighty percent of contractors working with JSIF
comply with the environmental safeguards. JSIF developed a method to quickly identify non-
compliance with safeguard policies by employing environmental officers, technical officers and external
supervisors to monitor the civil works projects weekly. JSIF applies environmental and social safeguards
regardless of the funding source.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

65.    JSIF’s Strategic Role as a Community Liaison. JSIF substantially improved its screening
process for identifying at risk children and youth in inner city communities and has increasingly acted as
an intermediary, connecting at-risk youths in inner cities to NGOs, the private sector and other
organizations that provide preventive social and youth development services.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

66.     The risk to the development outcome is Moderate. The Project supported training for community
maintenance committees as well as the development of a maintenance plan for the infrastructure works.
The committees have the capacity to do minor repairs themselves and engage the relevant authorities
should major repairs be necessary. The community centers are also projected to provide the
communities with a source of income (through space rental) to perform maintenance operations and
carry out community initiatives. In the 2013 Citizen Report Card Survey, 85 percent of respondents
answered “yes” to the question, “Do you believe the interventions will be sustainable?” Nevertheless,
service delivery sustainability is closely linked to the capacity of the service providers to recover their
costs and to enter the communities. The capacity of the communities’ ability to pay for services,
however, is questionable and hinges on employment opportunities and broader economic trends in
Jamaica. In addition, it is unknown whether financing to continue many of the violence prevention,
youth education and recreation and alternative livelihood programs will be secured. One of the
takeaways from the Project’s impact evaluation was the need for project design to plan for post-Project
sustainability – perhaps through developing public-private relationships or through helping communities
establish funds for ongoing maintenance of the infrastructure improvements.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

67.     The Bank team performed a comprehensive analysis of the NCDP and other related Projects and
integrated lessons learned in the Project design. The innovative combination of promoting community
based intervention and extending access to basic infrastructure was thoroughly developed in the Project
Appraisal Document. The design was ambitious and highly relevant both to the Bank and the Borrower.
The Bank design team could have more robustly assessed the complexity of the Project in terms of the
scope of the activities relative to the size of the loan and the timeframe as well as the risks associated
with the number of (and capacity of) the organizations involved in implementation. The Bank team also
                                                                                                        27
could have, as part of the procurement plan, better facilitated the engagement of local firms. In addition,
the Bank team could have more closely anticipated the extended timeframe associated with the land
tenure and micro-finance subcomponents, as well as the practicality of the original M&E framework.

Bank Performance in Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

68.      The Bank team closely monitored Project progress and identified and responded to major
implementation challenges. For instance, the Bank supervision team worked closely with JSIF to
prioritize works when the national economic crisis prompted a tightened fiscal framework. During the
MTR, the Bank team adjusted the Project’s scope, identifying the need to stop the microfinance and land
tenure works. JSIF also highlighted the value of the Bank’s assistance in the development of the crime
observatory. JSIF noted that financial management support from the Bank could have been strengthened
through more consistent feedback from the FM specialist and participation of the FM specialist as an
integrated member of the team conducting supervision missions. JSIF also noted that the Bank could
have provided more hands-on technical support on the microfinance and land titling activities during
their initial phases given JSIF’s limited experience in these areas.

Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

69.     Given the Bank’s Moderately Satisfactory preparation and Satisfactory supervision of the
Project, the ICR team rates the Bank’s overall performance as Satisfactory.

Borrower Performance

Government of Jamaica Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

70.     The Project benefited from a high level of commitment from the GoJ during preparation and
implementation. The GoJ complied with all covenants and agreements, and the Project became a pillar
of the GoJ’s CRP. During the fiscal crisis, the GoJ ensured that the Project received enough funds to
move forward. The GoJ also supported the Project through providing additional funds for personnel,
electricity and other expenses incurred by JSIF. The GoJ’s commitment to the goals of the Project is
highlighted by its solicitation of the ICDP Project.

Implementing Agency Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

71.     The Project successfully implemented sub-projects based on genuine community need because
of JSIF’s extensive community consultation process during the design of the Project and hands-on
supervision during implementation. JSIF went above and beyond Project expectation in the quantity and
range of capacity building exercises. JSIF also disseminated results from the Project by sharing various
results stories with local newspapers and radio talk shows. In addition, JSIF played a significant role in
connecting community residents with other government, non-profit and private sector projects of
interest. In the 2013 Citizen Report Card survey, 62 percent of respondents felt that the JSIF Project
team was organized/well-prepared. JSIF faced minor shortcomings in terms of financial reporting (see
the Implementation section).
                                                                                                        28
6. Lessons Learned

72.     Community engagement in project design during preparation and implementation helps
ensure relevance and builds community capacity. JSIF conducted a comprehensive, hands-on
community consultation process that included focus groups and rapid needs assessments to determine
the activities included in the Project. The community committees monitored the activities and based on
resident and committee feedback, JSIF adapted the activities each year to meet each community’s needs.
This flexible and highly participatory approach resulted in activities that were in line with community
needs: 84 percent of community members agreed that the best projects had been chosen for the
communities. 42 In addition, the involvement of the community committees in implementation helped
develop their capacity to independently orchestrate community-wide activities post-Project. For
instance, after the Project stopped financing summer camps, communities had the capacity to apply for
funds from the GoJ, administer costs and carry out the camps on their own. The Project’s use of CBC
was also key to successful implementation and building community capacity. CBC enhanced JSIF’s
relationship with the community, increased community ownership of the works, built community
member’s skill set to find future work opportunities, and provided community members with short-term
employment.

73.     Ensure service provider commitment at the outset for long-term sustainability. One of the
main implementation and sustainability challenges the Project faced was attaining the service providers’
commitment to assume responsibility for the works and to provide service to the areas. The service
providers were reluctant to enter the communities based on internal financial and technical constraints as
well as the communities’ low capacity to pay for services. The service providers had signed MoUs,
affirming their commitment to the Project, but this proved too weak of a measure to guarantee their
active involvement and commitment to the Project. This challenge could have been lessened had the
Project promoted further engagement at the sector and ministry levels to ensure that the investments
were tangibly supported by the sector and further analyzed cost recovery mechanisms.

74.     Adopt a community-wide approach as opposed to a partial community approach. To
maximize the reach of the Project and to catalyze change in communities, the Project targeted sections
of twelve communities. The “sectionalized” approach caused tension within the communities given that
at times houses along one side of the road were receiving access to a new service and houses on the
other side of were not. Community members and JSIF highlighted the importance of increasing
sensitivity to this issue in future projects to limit community conflict.

75.     Extended timelines for multi-sectoral urban development projects, particularly those that
incorporate crime and violence risk mitigation activities. The value of continued and consistent
engagement with clients such as JSIF cannot be underestimated. The GoJ sought the Bank’s assistance
with this innovative, multi sector project given successful past experience working together. The Bank
had the confidence to finance a highly ambitious project given JSIF’s demonstrated capacity to
implement. In addition to JSIF and the Bank’s past experience working together, the Project benefited
from having a seven (as opposed to a “typical” five-year) time frame. Not unlike other innovative multi-
sectoral projects, the Project had a slow launch due, in part, to the complexity of coordinating various
sector agencies and the novelty of the Project’s approach to crime and violence reduction; however,
once the Project gathered momentum with respect to community buy-in, the Project strongly performed
and achieved its various objectives.

     Citizen Report Card Survey 2013
                                                                                                       29
76.      Take into account local market capacity when designing procurement approach. The
Project confronted several procurement challenges that delayed implementation. Most local firms did
not have enough prior experience to bid on large contracts (over US$1.5 million), limiting their
participation. The British firm, HTSPE, that won the Project’s initial, large contract (to prepare designs
for the infrastructure works and to carry out the baseline survey among other activities) did not conduct
a thorough, on-the-ground assessment of each community and, as such, developed designs that did not
appropriately reflect the needs of the communities. The Bank team could have facilitated the
participation of local firms with a better on-the-ground understanding of the communities by breaking
the initial contract into smaller contracts. Making the contracts accessible to local firms, however, would
not have offered a golden solution. Many local firms were hesitant to bid for works in the 12
communities given the small scale of the individual projects and the security risks the firms foresaw in
entering the communities. The few firms willing to enter the communities became overburdened with
work during the implementation of the Project, leading to overall delays. The procurement plan could
have more thoroughly assessed and strategized how to effectively engage local and international firms.

77.     Ensure M&E approach takes into account latest best practices as well as local context. The
Project’s initial baseline survey was not well-designed in that, among other problems, it did not include
data from control groups or sufficiently large sample sizes, which rendered the baseline survey
significantly less useful in assessing the impact of project activities. The intermediate indicators were
largely based on household surveys, which made subsequent data collection difficult given the time and
cost associated with conducting the surveys and respondent fatigue from frequent surveys. When JSIF
and the Bank revised the intermediate indicators, JSIF had not been consistently collecting survey data
from households (in part because some works were still pending execution and also because the
information required was challenging to collect). Once the indicators were revised, JSIF began actively
collecting information on the progress of the Project. One mechanism JSIF used successfully for data
collection, verification and real-time feedback on progress was employing CLOs, who had a consistent
presence in the communities.

78.     Take political balance into account in project design. One design decision that played a key
role in the success of the Project was the decision of the community selection committee to include a
criterion on party of the local government administration. In Jamaica, political allegiance can be a
polarizing issue. The ICBSP communities had an even balance between the two leading political parties
and support for the Project did not waiver between administration changes.

79.      Leveraging activities with multiplier affects. The Project’s Operation Certification helped
3,550 community residents obtain birth certificates. Resident’s demand for the certification program
exceeded JSIF’s initial expectations, and 100 percent of participating residents reported satisfaction with
the activity. 43 Having a birth certificate formalizes citizenship and, in Jamaica, enables access to a range
of support programs. A birth certificate allows one to access civil registration documents (e.g. passport,
Tax Registration Number, National Insurance Scheme Number), which are needed for employment and
for other non-governmental services like the issuing of visas. In addition, citizens without birth
certificates cannot take standardized tests or be enrolled in a skills training program. Although there is
no direct link, since the Project’s implementation of the birth certificate program, the GoJ has mandated
that all Jamaicans receive birth certificates regardless of their ability to pay.

                              Annex 2. Project Output by Component
Component 1 - Access to Services
Roads              22.30 km of road rehabilitated and maintained. Roads had a transformative effect
                   on the communities. In the CRC survey, 46% if respondents said that the roads
                   works have improved feeling of safety within the community. Roads works were
                   also the most cited activity in the “Project strengths” section of the CRC survey.
Water Mains          The mains provide access for 3,576 households. The NWC will begin a
                     sensitization and installation program in June 2014 to regularize water service in
                     the communities. Connections for residents who have applied during and
                     immediately following the sensitization period should be finalized by October
                     2014.
Sewerage             The Project financed the rehabilitation of five sewage pipelines that correspond to
                     478 households. One of the five pipelines is now in use, benefiting approximately
                     95 households.
Solid Waste          The Project financed the purchase of a waste collection truck for NWSMA for
Collection           exclusive use in the 12 communities. The Project also financed the purchase of 51
                     skips. Thirty skips (or the capacity equivalent in drums) were positioned with
                     community consultation/CPTED techniques. On a whole, community members
                     have expressed satisfaction with waste collection (67% of respondents in the CRC
                     survey noted an improvement in trash collection), but solid waste is still
                     accumulating rapidly in the communities. NWSMA has limited resources to
                     conduct more frequent collections in the communities.

Microfinance         Microfinance agencies approved and disbursed 402 loans over the course of the
                     Project.
Security of tenure   The land titling activity was only conducted in Flankers due to the lengthy and
                     complicated process as well as limited human resource at JSIF to oversee the
                     implementation of this activity. The Ministry of Transport, Works, and Housing
                     has received 710 Splinter titles, to be later awarded to Flankers residents upon
                     payment.
Community            The Project financed nine community centers, four of which are mobile. The fixed
Centers              community centers have space to rent for stores as well as a large event space.
                     The revenue generated from these community centers is expected to help the
                     community committees maintain the centers and promote community wide
                     activities. In the CRC survey, 77% of respondents were satisfied or very satisfied
                     with the community centers.
Crime prevention     CPTED techniques were applied in the: (i) lighting for community center; (ii) the
through              construction of football fields, multipurpose courts and other recreational spaces;
environmental        (iii) fencing of both residential (zinc-fence substitution) and community
design               recreational facilities; and (iv) road rehabilitation, including the repair of manhole
                     covers located in the roadway.
Component 2 - Public Safety Enhancement and Capacity Building

                                                                                                         33
All Component 2 subcomponents benefited from the mobilization and community outreach strategies
employed by the Project. These included the use of community liaison officers, mobilization through the
community committees, and national media publicity. JSIF also tapped into partner networks to
publicize and mobilize community residents. There was particularly high demand in the communities for
education, skills training and mediation/conflict resolution interventions. 45
Mediation and Conflict Resolution Activities
Mediators training    87 people were trained as mediators. An additional 35 people did not finish the
                      practicum and were thus not certified.

Level da vibes        9,154 participants. Level Da Vibes sessions originally focused on violence
session               prevention and developmental issues through informal discussion, role play and
                      cultural events. In 2010, it was adjusted to include a wide range of activities
                      focused on life skills development to: (i) inculcate positive values and attitudes;
                      and (ii) enhance talent and skills for upward mobility, provision of income and

                      (which included pre and post psychological/knowledge, attitude, practice and
                      behavior assessment, life skills training and individual/group psychotherapy
                      sessions by psychiatrist/psychologist/clinical social workers); (ii) a counseling

Operation             3,550 participants. The initiative aimed to help residents obtain their birth
certification         certificates. Having a birth certificate formalizes citizenship and, in Jamaica,
                      enables access to a range of support programs. A birth certificate allows one to
                      access civil registration documents (e.g. passport, Tax Registration Number,
                      National Insurance Scheme Number), which are needed for employment and for
                      other non-governmental services like the issuing of visas. In addition, persons
                      without birth certificates cannot take standardized tests or be enrolled in a skills
                      training program. Since the Project’s implementation of the birth certificate
                      program, the GoJ has mandated that all Jamaicans receive birth certificates
                      regardless of their ability to pay.

                      worked to build resilience of the program’s teenagers to manage a range of risks,
                      including teenage pregnancy. 46 JSIF has expanded on this pilot version and is
                      currently carrying out the Bridge program with 28 families outside the Project’s
                      communities.
Community             3,388 participants. The original fair was a one-off project implemented by the
information fairs     community group in Whitfield Town to gauge community interest and to
                      introduce them to services available to enhance community and personal
                      development. Later, this model was used in all the communities, particularly
                      during the Operation Certification registration periods.

Mentorship            431 relationships established. The mentorship program was piloted in seven
                      communities. In 2013, the final program was conducted only in Federal Gardens.

Cultural animation    943 participants. In 2009, a series of community groups participated in a national
                      cultural festival. In 2010 and 2011, the focus was on training select persons
                      (animators) to administer and train other community members in the cultural
                      animation strategies.

Summer camps          9,708 participants. After the Project stopped financing summer camps,
                      communities continued hosting the camps, given the popularity and the new
                      ‘know-how’ to apply for funds from the GoJ, administer funds, register and
                      manage the camps.

                       of the seminars was to inform these students about the new expectations that
                       would be placed on them in their secondary institutions and to engage the students
                       in figuring out how to manage these and become more active in their own
                       educational outcomes.

Guidance               976 participants. The counseling was two pronged: (i) guidance counseling for

The Alternative Livelihoods and Skills Development activities benefited from the numerous
partnerships with both community-based and national training institutions, as well as the community-
based organizations that managed the projects on the ground. General results from these activities in the
CRC survey included 46% of respondents citing job creation as better or much better and 46% of
respondents citing educational opportunities as better or much better.
Youth engagement       1,788 participants. This program was developed in conjunction with the
                       communities who said that they would prefer a program that specifically targeted
                       unattached youth 17-25 years old who would not have been able to benefit under
                       the previous youth summer employment programs because of their low skill and
                       literacy levels.


Zinc fence             972 participants participated in certification initiatives. Initially, low literacy
removal/block wall     levels in the communities prevented this certification initiative from moving
construction &         forward. Later, changes to the ALSD program allowed for the simultaneous
construction on site   enrollment of students in construction certification programs and remedial
certification          literacy/numeracy classes. Through this methodology, 81 persons were able to
                       receive certification.

                       Over 13,000 residents (representing 3,260 households) benefited from zinc fence

                        Jamaica Inner City Basic Services for the Poor Project

1.     The objective of the Project was to improve the quality of life of about 60,000 residents in twelve
inner city areas and poor urban informal settlements by improving access to basic urban infrastructure,
financial services, land tenure regularization, and enhanced public safety and community capacity.

Methodology

2.     At appraisal, two approaches were used to evaluate the economic impact of the investment: a)
Cost benefit analysis for water and sewerage; using willingness to pay to estimate the benefits; and b)
Cost effectiveness analysis for all other interventions. The analysis of these interventions was
completed with a “reverse” economic analysis, which had the objective of finding the willingness to pay
that would have provided a 12 percent economic rate of return. Results showed that: a) water and
sewerage interventions were expected to be economically viable; and b) the least-cost alternative was
selected for each of the interventions.

3.     This evaluation used two approaches as well: a) Cost benefit analysis; and b) Comparison of
least-costs options selected at appraisal to actual costs. Cost benefit analysis was conducted for road,
education, and training. It was not used for water and sanitation interventions, given that only 95
households have been connected to the sewer system, and no households have been connected to the
water system. Eight water mains were installed and have been gradually handed over to the NWC. JSIF
is working very closely with the NWC to get households to connect to the main pipes. The NWC is
responsible for helping residents connect but has been hesitant to extend service to the communities
given their low capacity to pay. The NWC highlighted that people in these communities illegally tap
into the system, and that the NWC does not have the capacity to monitor connections and target payment
collection.

4.      Comparison of cost between least-cost alternatives selected at appraisal to actual costs of
interventions. The method was applied as follows: expected costs of interventions were compared to
actual costs. If actual costs were lower than expected, the Project yielded higher benefits than expected;
the contrary occurs when actual costs were higher than expected. For the comparison, actual costs in
nominal prices were transformed to 2006 prices and inflation and exchange rate fluctuation were taken
out. To make an accurate comparison, the number of beneficiaries was included and a unit cost was
estimated.

Cost Benefit Analysis

5.     JSIF hired Trevor Hamilton & Associates Center for Excellence, a consultancy firm, to evaluate
the Project from an economic point of view. They conducted a cost benefit analysis for interventions on
road, education, and training interventions. Given the limited information available, they made
                                                                                                     38
assumptions based on their knowledge and experience. The assumptions and results are presented
below.

Road Intervention

6.     Many of the contracts for road rehabilitation included other infrastructure in what is called an
“integrated infrastructure” contract. It was not possible to identify the cost for the roads by themselves.
There was no information of traffic counts, to estimate the impact on the interventions.

7.    The Consultants used the following assumptions:

Education Component

10.    The objectives of the intervention were: a) to increase access to literacy and numeracy programs
to 600 students in the 12 targeted communities of ICBSP, thereby improving their mastery level by 40
percent by June 2011; and b) to increase GSAT preparation assistance for 550 students in the twelve
communities.
11. Evaluating the achievement of these two objectives was very challenging as there was no
common test done at any of the centers, and there was no instrument to evaluate this group of students.
The consultants were able to match only a limited number of pre-tests and GSAT scores for the same
cohort of students, and so many of the children remained unaccounted for. Results showed that out of
210 students, 24 would have entered a traditional high school compared with just 8 before the project.
Based on this, the benefits were calculated as the incremental earnings for those students.

12.   Results show return of 16% of this intervention.

Skilled Training

13. The skills areas offered under the ICBSP included building construction, food preparation,
plumbing, electrical, and welding. The Consultants’ findings on the Skills Certification program were as
follows: a) focus groups indicated that demand exceeded supply by about 40%; and b) those who
secured certification and gained employment were likely to earn higher income than if they were
uncertified or unskilled. The Consultants estimated that the daily rate for skilled labor in construction
was about 60% higher that it was for unskilled labor. Out of 4,450 people receiving training, 815
received certification. Of the certified beneficiaries, approximately 204 beneficiaries (18%) received
jobs. For determining the net economic benefits for the table below, the Consultants assumed that 77%
of the salaries for the target ICBSP beneficiaries consisted of external leakages and transfer payments.
                                                                                                       40

15.   Results show return of 39 percent.

Cost Comparison Analysis

16. Actual costs of implemented works were USD31M, 5% lower than the expected USD32.7M.
This comparison is not accurate as actual costs are expressed in nominal prices during the
implementation period, while the expected costs were expressed at 2006 prices. Actual costs had to be
adjusted in nominal prices to 2006 prices taking out the effect of inflation and exchange rate fluctuation.

17. According to the Statistics Institute of Jamaica the consumer price increased 123 percent from
2006 through 2013. At the same time, depreciation of the Jamaican dollar has been persistent during the
period; according to the Bank of Jamaica, it depreciated 65% against the dollar. The annual average
exchange rate went from J$ 65: 1USD at time of appraisal to J$ 109: 1USD in 2013 (Figure 1).

18. Depreciation helped the Project, as the GoJ received more money for each disbursement of IBRD
funds; while inflation did the opposite, making the project costlier and so disadvantageous for the
Project. To measure the impact of these fluctuations, actual costs were transformed on a year-by-year
basis to 2006 prices. The results show the difference explained by: a) fluctuation of the Jamaican dollar;
and b) real variation of costs of the interventions.

19. Impact of the exchange rate fluctuation was estimated transforming the yearly USD
disbursements to local currency using the annual average exchange rate reported by the Bank of
Jamaica. The result was compared with the amount obtained using the exchange rate at appraisal. The
average exchange rate obtained from the disbursed funds was J$92.96:1USD, which compared to the
exchange rate at appraisal of J$65.5:1USD, translates into a 42% gain for the Project. Impact of inflation
was estimated adjusting the actual costs expressed in Jamaican dollars with the inflation rate during the
implementation period. Results shows that the Project was affected on average 43% due to inflation.
The net effect of fluctuation of the Jamaican dollar was only 1%, as the 42% gain obtained by
depreciation was offset by the 43% loss due to inflation.

20.      Results show that actual costs at 2006 prices were 24% lower than expected at appraisal (Table
1).

21. Intervention in each of the components had a lower cost than expected (Table 3). Only two
interventions show higher costs: 79% for community centers, and 13% for Component 2 (Public Safety
Enhancement and Capacity Building). However, as table 3 shows, achievements were higher than
expected and so the unit cost was lower (Table 4).

Results.

24. The results of the cost benefit analysis shows that intervention on roads, education, and training
were economically viable, yielding returns of 12%, 16%, and 39% respectively.

25. The result of comparing expected to actual costs show that interventions had higher impact than
expected at appraisal, positively affecting the socio-economic development of the inner city areas where
investments were made. This conclusion is drawn from three facts: a) real costs of interventions (at
2006 prices) were 24% lower than foreseen at appraisal; ii) number of actual beneficiaries (about 62
thousand) was 3% higher than expected (60 thousand) bringing the unit cost per beneficiary down by
27%; and c) the Project’s objective was achieved as it provided basic infrastructure service to about 62
thousand residents, plus additional improvements to their quality of life. According to the survey
conducted after implementation, 52% of respondents felt safe or very safe, 18% households would like
to stay in the community, and 19% would like to start a business.

                                    Annex 5. Borrower’s Report


Borrower’s Assessment
1.     The following comments serve as an assessment of the Government of Jamaica’s achievements
regarding the project design, implementation and operational experience in the execution of IBRD loan
agreement no. 7148 – JM. These comments will reflect on the lessons learned throughout the
implementation of the project.

Project’s Context
2.      In 2004, the year in which project design began, the major crime and murder rates both reported
significant increases. The murder rate continued to rise in 2005. Much of the criminal activity was
concentrated in certain urban and peri-urban areas considered ‘inner city communities’. Among other
common characteristics, these communities tended to exhibit increasing levels of public insecurity and
suffer from poor access to basic services, low educational attainment and consistently high structural
unemployment (due to low educational attainment, dearth of proper training, skills mismatch, few
nearby employment opportunities and hiring discrimination against community residents).

Project’s Relevance at the Time of Design
3.     The project was very relevant to the Borrower (Government of Jamaica; GoJ). It supported the
GoJ’s efforts to meet Millenium Development Goal targets and contributed to national poverty-, crime-
and violence-reduction initiatives. The ICBSP also incorporated lessons learned under the
implementation of other inner city urban renewal programmes.

Project’s Design (PDO, Components)
4.     The ICBSP was designed on the basis of a Community-Driven Development (CDD) approach
and financed small- and medium-scale infrastructure and social projects. The selection of project
communities was led by the Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ) and involved the Ministry of National
Security, the Social Development Commission (SDC) and JSIF. Hence, the project design was aligned
to national priorities and reflected a multifaceted understanding of the needs of the targeted
communities.

5.      The Project was structured with three components, each with subcomponent activities reflected
in the indicators and aligned to the PDO. The components were adequate and were largely clear in
content, organised, and implementable.


6.     The Project’s design was innovative because it was the first in the country to take an integrated
approach to crime- and violence-prevention. Instead of hard policing and paramilitary force, the ICBSP
used infrastructure and public safety methodologies to address crime and violence in the target areas.
The addition of the Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF) Grant allowed for innovation through the
development of a national crime observatory to present timely and reliable crime statistical data with
coverage for the 12 ICBSP communities and the five major parishes where crime is deemed to be
highest. The inclusion of this component was intended to facilitate the disaggregation of crime data for
the monitoring and evaluation of the ICBSP and by extension other crime prevention Projects being

                                                                                                     47
undertaken by the government of Jamaica and other donor agencies. The Grant also provided support to
the 12 communities under its public safety component through community action planning and small
soft projects for implementation. This subcomponent helped to enrich and increase the reach of
beneficiaries within the ICBSP communities that the ICBSP would not have otherwise been able to
achieve on its own.

7.      The pre-selection of the ICBSP communities was another innovation; the JSIF feels this is most
appropriate to interventions focusing on inner city communities (in contrast to rural communities). Pre-
selection allowed the ICBSP to provide a focused approach over multiple years on the selected
communities, which is necessary to break the cycle of crime and violence in the inner city context. One
gap of this approach was the lack of complementary funds to provide for interventions along a more
demand-driven methodology to both inner city communities peripheral to those selected and rural
communities in general. These funds, had they been provided, would have helped to reduce the feelings
of resentment and alienation from residents of communities neighbouring those of the ICBSP, for whom
interventions could not be provided. Such funds, in the case of rural communities, would have also
allowed for the assuaging of the feeling that inner city communities were benefiting due to their
‘badness’ – a moral hazard of providing funds solely to communities with severe crime and violence
problems; other poor communities with better crime and violence outcomes may feel that they have to
become ‘bad’ to benefit from development assistance.

8.      The use of Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED) techniques was also
innovative. CPTED considerations have subsequently been incorporated into the JSIF’s Management
Information System (MIS) and Technical Review Committee, to ensure that all of JSIF’s relevant
infrastructure interventions, regardless of donor, may benefit from the guidelines.

Risks
9.     The ICBSP PAD identified five critical risks. Of these, four were largely successfully mitigated.
Crime and violence was sporadic and affected infrastructure implementation minimally, in only two
communities. The ICBSP successfully built community capacity to allow for community engagement
and ownership of project investments, which mitigated the major risks to the project posed by crime and
violence. Environment and involuntary resettlement frameworks were used effectively. Ultimately, the
microfinance and land tenure subcomponents were not limited by demand.

10.     Although the project did suffer from limited breakdown of Memoranda of Understanding with
service providers and local authorities, the extensive consultations during project preparation resulted in
partners’ responsibilities being undertaken as far as was practicable (given resource constraints).


11.      Other risks included the use of CBC, particularly for basic infrastructure investments and the
ability of the project to establish a culture of service provider payment given limited income flows. CBC
investments are comparatively low value individually, but cumulatively significant. The limited initial
capacity of the community groups made necessary capacity building and limits on the number and value
of CBC works contracts. Regarding bill payment, although there is evidence of payment following the
electrification project in Bucknor, beneficiaries still found it difficult to pay given their income. This


                                                                                                        48
limitation further makes it difficult for the project to persuade utility providers of any difference in
cultural change, even if one exists.

Project’s Implementation
12.    Factors that contributed to successful implementation included:
           • Community and wider stakeholder involvement in subproject selection: provided clear
               evidence of the relevance and demand for project investments.
           • Community Liaisons: Social Officers and CLOs were engaged in outreach and capacity
               building activities with project beneficiaries. This was instrumental to improving
               intervention relevance to needs and community ownership and participation in planning,
               construction and maintenance activities.
           • Flexibility of indicators: allowed for project activities to be reviewed and adjusted
               according to changes in demand and economic growth industries.
           • Communication at the national and parochial levels: helped to raise awareness of project
               activities, highlight successes and promote results. This helped to expand participation
               and ownership by community residents.
           • Synergies with JSDF Grant: allowed for a more coordinated and targeted approach donor
               fund expenditure within the same geographic space, with similar development objectives.
               This optimised beneficiary coverage and subproject intervention scope and thus allowed
               for greater innovation and flexibility in sub project designs.
           • Partnerships: the establishment of linkages and coordination with other providers of
               services within targeted communities assisted with expanding and deepening impact of
               project activities e.g. Digicel Foundation, Citizen Security and Justice Programme, SDC,
               CHASE Foundation, Food for the Poor, etc.
13.    The most significant delay to project implementation was the lack of suitability of the pre-
formulated infrastructure designs. Over 50% of the designs had to be redone. Each design took about 6
weeks to 3 months to complete, resulting in a cumulative delay of at least 1 year, with some designs
being done concurrently.

Monitoring & Evaluation
14.     The project’s original baseline survey was weak; the Bank-hired consultant did not report survey
results for the control communities and used sample sizes (to which the Borrower agreed at the time)
that produced margins of error of 10% or higher in some communities and may have resulted in
inaccurate baseline measurements of community indicators. Subsequent consultants hired under the
project expressed unwillingness to use the same methodologies. The selection of only four controls for
the project’s twelve communities and the non-reporting of the control baselines reduced the strength of
the project’s final impact evaluation by rendering a robust difference-in-differences approach
impossible.

15.     The project’s monitoring and evaluation (M&E) design assumed that regular surveys of the
project population would be carried out; if not, proper reporting on original project indicators would be
impossible. Due to accuracy concerns, informal surveys were not heavily used for project indicator
reporting. This led to higher M&E expenditures per survey than the design anticipated. Additionally,
where interventions are concentrated over many years in communities with small populations, regular
surveying is highly likely to result in respondent fatigue, particularly when delays in implementation
                                                                                                      49
occur and respondents feel as if they are getting more surveys than benefits. This is also a particular
concern for control community surveying. The revision of the indicators to rely more heavily on
administrative data was crucial for project M&E success.


16.     The project had two results-level indicators. Both were able to provide a method for measuring
the main impact of the Project and were complementary in their ability to do this. Even so, they each
suffered from intrinsic measurement drawbacks. Quantifications of access to improvements under
ICBSP Component 1 were hampered by concerns of overstatements due to double-counting. To
minimise this, the project chose to use the beneficiary figures for the intervention type in each
community with the highest beneficiary count. This method, therefore, was unable to take into account
beneficiaries from other non-overlapping infrastructure intervention types, nor persons who had
benefited from microfinance loans who might have otherwise not considered themselves beneficiaries
from infrastructure interventions. The measurement of the second indicator, which tracks the perception
of public safety in the communities, was impeded by the inability to measure that indicator through
administrative data.

17.    The original intermediate-level indicators were numerous and required extensive surveying to
measure: they were not able to be measured passively through the use of administrative data collected
through implementation of project interventions or by the state. They were formally revised in 2009.
The revised indicators did provide a clear method for measuring the project’s key outputs, as a whole.

18.    The project’s M&E indicators were used regularly throughout implementation to evaluate project
progress and determine areas of weakness in need of focus.

19.     Due to the revision of the project’s indicators, a formula was recommended for calculating the
target total of the indicators, to include work done in the years prior to the change as both targets and
actual progress. The World Bank ISRs’ calculations of the targets do not, however, seem to take these
years into account, possibly due to differentiating approaches / loss of knowledge following personnel
changes in the Bank and at JSIF. For ease of comparison, the World Bank-recognised targets have been
used in calculating the achievements of the project.

Project’s Outcome
Rating: Satisfactory
20.     The project was still relevant to both GoJ and wider Jamaican interests at the time of completion.
The project was effective in its outcomes. Both PDOs were met. The communities were generally
satisfied with both project outcomes and project implementation. In 2013 Citizens’ Report Card, 98% of
respondents said they would welcome the JSIF back into their communities, 84% of respondents said
the best projects were chosen for the communities, and 76% of respondents believed that the project got
value for money. The project indicators paint a reasonable picture of project implementation success.

21.     The efficiency of the project can be measured in terms of implementation efficiency, through the
ratio of administrative to subproject expenditure, and development efficiency, through the cost of the
investments in comparison to their benefit to the communities. As at 31 December 2013, JSIF had spent
USD 1.62M in Recurrent Costs and Other Services (under the Project Management component) to

                                                                                                       50
provide 27.3M in infrastructural and social investment to the communities. This suggests high
administrative efficiency, with recurrent costs and other services totalling 6% of direct investment
expenditure. If all Project Management and Evaluation expenditure is considered (including the cost for
providing major evaluations), then this represents a very reasonable 19.7% of direct investment
expenditure. The cost-benefit analysis provided through the Impact Evaluation suggested a positive
economic rate of return on the roads, education and skills training investments.

Additional Impacts
22.     JSIF institutional capacity was widely and positively affected by the ICBSP. JSIF gained
significant experience in inner city project implementation, which also positively affected wider national
capacity in this regard, due to knowledge sharing and the movement of former project staff to other
government agencies. For example, an academic paper that focused on ICBSP best practices (alongside
that of one other project implemented in inner city communities) was presented at a national conference.

23.    JSIF’s capacity to implement infrastructure projects was generally increased under the ICBSP,
but particularly increased due to the mandated use of CPTED techniques and the process of improving
the waterlogged soil at Knollis prior to construction of the community centre, since both of these were
new to the organisation. The land tenure intervention also significantly improved JSIF’s capacity to
undertake these sorts of interventions and suggest policy improvements based on the experience.

24.    The design and development of the national crime observatory made JSIF a pioneer in crime and
injury surveillance through its product and partnership agreement with its major stakeholder, the
Ministry of National Security, and the wide cross-section of other government Ministries, Departments
and Agencies (MDAs) which contribute to and benefit from the observatory.

Sustainability – Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
25.     The ability of the relevant government MDAs to absorb and maintain the infrastructure
investments, particularly where community maintenance is not possible (e.g. for underground sewage
pipelines) presents a risk to the communities’ development outcomes. Although MoUs were developed
with and signed by all relevant MDAs, fiscal constraints and internal prioritisation exercises may limit
the ability of these entities to regularly carry out maintenance.

26.    In terms of social investments, although JSIF successfully piloted a number of programmes
under the ICBSP and the community committees received significant experience in managing these, the
sustainability of these programmes may be limited by the ability of the communities to access funds,
given the limited funding disbursed by NGOs, Foundations, etc. and the continued economic hardship
experienced by these communities. Additionally, where programmes relevant to a specific government
MDA have been piloted, these have yet to be scaled up and institutionalised.

Rating of the Bank at Design
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
27.     The Bank’s input into the concept of the ICBSP, particularly in terms of its PDOs and the
integration of the two main components, helped to make the project a success. Unfortunately, other


                                                                                                       51
elements of the design worked to the project’s detriment – in particular, the hiring of a single foreign
consultant to undertake infrastructure pre-formulation and baseline data collection.
28.     The Project Appraisal Document’s balance in terms of providing specificity as to what sort of
interventions should happen under the project, as well as some latitude for change given changing
conditions on the ground, allowed JSIF a clear framework for implementation. Some of the restrictions
placed on the project did provide difficulties, however, due to the project’s and the country’s particular
circumstances. The detailed and multi-layered structure of the budget categories hampered project
implementation: during implementation, the needs across budget categories varied and the structure as
imposed made it difficult to adjust and respond. Additionally, the initial decision to tender very large
infrastructure projects proved to be a challenge: there were few contractors in the higher cost categories
and fewer still willing to undertake the work given the location of the project communities. However,
the Bank’s acknowledgement of these and other design difficulties during implementation helped to
ensure that lessons learned were acted upon: in the case above, the infrastructure projects were
eventually broken into smaller packages, which allowed for their successful implementation.

Rating of the Bank During Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
29.     The frequency of the Bank’s supervision missions and the willingness of Bank staff to respond to
expressed concerns were commendable. The JSIF found the support provided generally for the
subcomponents of the project were good, but the project could have benefitted from additional
Technical Support and input in new implementation areas (particularly microfinance and land tenure
regularisation), given the Bank’s extensive worldwide experience. Although the focus of both the JSIF
and the Bank during the first two years of implementation largely rested on the need to redesign the
basic infrastructure subcomponent, the provision of technical assistance for the relatively novel elements
during this time might have helped to speed up implementation and improve final results. Additionally,
changes in Bank personnel, templates and reporting formats during the life of the project made for
occasional disruptions to consistency.

30.      In 2006, when ICBSP implementation began, the Bank had recently instituted its Client
Connection system. Client Connection increased the transparency of the project’s financial data and
improved the efficiency of the JSIF’s ability to manage the project’s finances. However, the relative
novelty of the system on both ends contributed to errors that, even after discussion with Bank support
staff at the time, were not properly resolved until years after the fact. During the push toward resolution,
the support of the Bank’s team was crucial to the successful outcome.


31.    The commitment of the Bank to see to the successful development and implementation of the
crime observatory is highly commendable. The Bank’s responsiveness to allowing the reallocation of
funds to facilitate the hiring of the best technical expertise in the field, has helped in the development of
a more useful and optimal tool that can be measured against other observatories in the region.

Rating of the GoJ
Rating: Satisfactory
32.     The role and mandate of the JSIF was clearly established in the national poverty reduction
strategy. The Government was highly supportive of ICBSP’s innovative approaches furthering

                                                                                                          52
community-driven development through access to basic infrastructure services, associated employment,
training, land tenure and social services. GoJ provided over USD 3M of counterpart funding to ICBSP in
a timely manner, even when facing major fiscal constraints in managing macro-economic indicators.
Government representatives on the JSIF’s Board of Directors ensured that JSIF’s operations were
transparent and efficient, which resulted in JSIF continuing its operations through changes in
Administrations. The Government could have better mediated the difficulties between the JSIF and
National Water Commission (NWC) but, in the end, the NWC was unable to facilitate flat rates and
wholesale household connections in the communities because of the magnitude of the investment and
returns on same.

33.     The Government of Jamaica and the JSIF implemented the ICBSP with due diligence and
flexibility in responding to needs and implementation issues as they arose. The core objectives of the
ICBSP were met and in many areas targets were surpassed.

Rating of JSIF
Rating: Satisfactory
34.     The JSIF effectively implemented ICBSP. JSIF staff took on the challenge of transferring greater
control and responsibility to community groups, which represented a departure from usual practice and
increased their workload and implementation complexity. Administrative and investment costs
compared favourably with both national and international benchmarks. The JSIF maintained procedural
transparency and ISO 14001:2004 status and was recognized nationally for its innovative efforts to
protect and preserve Jamaica's natural environment. The pairing of the JSDF’s Crime Observatory with
ICBSP subproject interventions has allowed JSIF to carry out ground-breaking work in the field of
crime prevention. JSIF also undertook gender mainstreaming in implementing its project interventions,
although this was not specifically required of the project. See Sub-Annex B for further information on
JSIF’s approach and commitment to gender mainstreaming.

35.    The JSIF made significant progress in developing the MIS as an effective management tool
during the course of the project. Between 2006 & 2013, this MIS benefited from over 25 rounds of mid-
to major improvements, to include: server and hardware updates, numerous updates of general project
management software, and an upgrade to the general financial management software of the
organisation.. Although there is still progress to be made, JSIF continues to make improvements to the
MIS, from which other projects run by the organisation also benefit.


36.    Despite this overall success, the JSIF faced some challenges in implementing the ICBSP. These
included:
          • Sporadic outbreaks of violence in the communities, despite the reductions achieved by
              the project, delayed project activities in the communities and posed obstacles to
              participation of community members in project activities that took place outside the
              communities (e.g. skills training) due to curfews, etc.
          • Turnover of technical staff working on the project, often times to national/regional
              agencies due to their high quality, was responsible for some loss of momentum in
              implementation.


                                                                                                     53
           •   The challenge in procuring surveying services for land registration, due to surveyors’
               unwillingness to work in the inner city, significantly delayed the land titling initiative.
           •   The work done under the ICBSP is a testament to the JSIF’s ability to effectively partner
               with both public and private institutions. In spite of this, partnership agreements did
               occasionally fall through. This reduced the effectiveness of services such as electricity
               regularisation and resulted in the non-implementation of others, such as the household
               water connections and the sewage treatment plant for Tawes Meadows. Often, when
               these breakdowns occurred, the basic problem was often a mismatch between each
               institution’s timeframe for implementation and resultant funding prioritisation.

Lessons Learned
37.      The component- and subcomponent-specific lessons contained in this section are abridged: a full
list of those lessons considered most critical by the Borrower are included Sub Annex A.
             • Where possible, project communities should coincide with nationally-recognised
                 community boundary lines, to allow for ease of recognition of project boundaries on the
                 ground and in partnership discussions, as well as ease of M&E of project activities.
             • Sector buy-in for community development projects must be tangible, established and
                 measured throughout the project. While communities may see certain projects as priority,
                 if the Sector support is absent, then sustainability will be difficult. At the level of the
                 donor and country partner, some level of commitment must be structured to ensure that
                 funds invested in communities receive the required support from the large Sectors.
             • Infrastructure investments must be balanced with and complemented by social services.
                 Complementary social service provision is essential to improving and maintaining access
                 to the infrastructural works and intervention sustainability. Complementary technical
                 assistance and the capacity building of national institutions (in both government and non-
                 government sectors) are also integral to project success: in the case of the ICBSP, the
                 support from the JSDF Grant through the development of the Crime Observatory and the
                 participatory Community Action Plans, as well as the capacity building of NGOs and
                 NSAs, were all very important to the project’s capacity to achieve its development
                 objectives.
             • Human capital development and capacity building is a prerequisite for successful project
                 implementation in inner city environments.
             • In the case of projects with pre-formulated infrastructure components: depending on the
                 type, size and volume of the intervention, a considered period for Design Review and
                 Amendment should be included in the Project Design.
             • Management/Sustainability plans should be paramount in the consideration of: solid
                 waste management initiatives, community centre design, and sewage treatment solutions.
             • The role of the liaison officers “on-the-ground”/interfacing with the community must be
                 closely monitored from the onset to ensure that representatives of the various groups
                 understand their role in the partnership. This sets the platform to attain community “buy-
                 in” at large which is essential for the success of the intervention.
             • Communication/Training: Participatory approach in identifying needs, frequency in
                 communication, and training are of high importance generally and are critical in
                 empowering the CBOs to undertake their role in the maintenance of the infrastructure,
                 educational-recreational, and mediation and conflict program.
                                                                                                          54
           •   Coordination with other donors with complementing objectives will contribute to
               narrowing the needs gap, eliminate “overlaps”, and make for wider impact on the
               communities at large.
           •   Coordination with Local Authorities/Agencies is crucial in avoiding conflict between
               existing/planned services and project investments. Without this coordination, the
               advancing of approval for work plans, and overall implementation of the project can be
               affected adversely.
           •   A dedicated monitoring and evaluation coordinator would be an asset and help to ensure
               that M&E data is accurately, effectively and thoroughly collated, so that it can be
               produced in a timely manner.
           •   The experience under the ICBSP has reinforced the importance of timely and accurate
               fiduciary management and reporting; the JSIF has added another layer of due diligence to
               facilitate this.
Crime Statistics:
           •   Community stigma against ‘informers’ results in under-reporting of crime statistics, even
               those collected through informal means. This creates a difficulty for projects that are
               expected to improve community trust in external entities (including the police), but are
               also being judged against their reduction of extant crime statistics. As social trust goes
               up, crime reporting may also go up, although no ‘additional’ crime is actually taking
               place.
           •   Highlight for other projects: The project experienced difficulties disaggregating crime
               data at the community level during the first years of project implementation: this has been
               significantly improved by the Jamaica Crime Observatory, which was put in place
               through the Japan Social Development Fund’s grant funding for the establishment of an
               Integrated Crime and Violence Information System.
COMPONENT- AND SUBCOMPONENT-SPECIFIC LESSONS (ABRIDGED):
Access to Services : Basic Infrastructure:
           •   Thorough site investigations, appropriate designs and realistic construction schedules
               (that take into account each location’s social and geographic peculiarities) are paramount.
Access to Services : Access to Financial Services:
           •   Consultation and educational processes must be extended to internal stakeholders, within
               the implementation agency, as well as to outside groups who will be necessary for project
               implementation. Technical assistance for implementing MFIs is also paramount.
Public Safety Enhancement and Capacity Building:
Building Community Capacity through Community-Based Contracting:
           •   Community-based contracting is an important option to nurture and develop community
               capacity through “on-the-job-training. The ICBSP experience shows that the relevant
               question is not whether CBC is better than traditional methods, but rather in which
               circumstances and communities one method is preferable. CBC may require previous
                                                                                                       55
             capacity building to work and generally requires additional time built into project
             timelines. However, ICBSP experience has shown that this methodology can work well.
Youth Education and Recreation:
          •   There is continued need for: (i) the use of technology to deliver curriculum in centres and
              (ii) capacity building of schools to deliver remedial education by investing in school labs
              and software.
Mediation & Conflict Resolution:
          •   The multi-modal programme developed under this subcomponent increased the
              interventions’ interest to the various at-risk groups.




                                                                                                      56
Annex A: Further Lessons Learned
COMPONENT- AND SUBCOMPONENT-SPECIFIC LESSONS:
Access to Services : Basic Infrastructure:
           •   During Formulation stage – due diligence in a thorough site investigation, and
               appropriate designs are paramount to successful implementation of civil/infrastructure
               Works.
           •   Construction schedule should be realistic to the specifics of some locations, and
               management/updating of same must be constant.
           •   The provision of solid waste equipment and infrastructure was supported by the training
               of environmental wardens under the Public Safety Enhancement and Capacity Building
               component. However, incentivisation of all stakeholders – the wardens, the CBOs, the
               NSWMA and the community residents – through a combination of monetary and non-
               monetary incentives, is necessary to improve the quality of work and the sustainability of
               the solid waste gains made under the project.
           •   Highlight for other projects: strong environmental management record: JSIF understands
               the potential impacts of its civil projects on the environment and its ISO-certified
               environmental management systems provide a crucial framework for encouraging
               environmentally positive practices. The JSIF has over 80% contractor compliance as
               regards the environmental safeguards that we have implemented. Breaches are quickly
               identified and reported and rectification takes place immediately. These environmental
               safeguards include:
                   o Performing an environmental screening or baseline assessment prior to approval
                       of any project for implementation.
                   o Conducting a technical review of all project designs to ensure that environmental
                       mitigation measures are included for any potential environmental issues identified
                       during screening.
                   o Employment of an environmental Scientist to monitor and report on projects
                       environmental performance.
                   o Weekly monitoring of projects by external supervisors, JSIF technical Officers,
                       and environmental officer.
                   o Provision of a copy of the JSIF’s Environmental Management Plan to each
                       contractor as part of their contract document.
Access to Services : Access to Financial Services:
           •   The experience on this indicates the need for consultation and educational processes to be
               extended to internal stakeholders, within the implementation agency, as well as to outside
               groups who will be necessary for project implementation (e.g., the National Contracts
               Commission [NCC]).
           •   Future initiatives will benefit if the staff member charged with project management has a
               thorough knowledge of microfinance best practices and is able to devote his or her full
               time to the administration of the subcomponent.

                                                                                                      57
          •   Highlight for other projects: The provision for technical assistance should be included in
              future microfinance initiatives, particularly when they seek to expand microfinance to
              new areas in which MFIs currently have little exposure.
Access to Services : Land Tenure Regularization:
          •   Land tenure regularization is a long and tedious process, especially for informal
              settlements, and involves multiple MDAs of government with varying roles and
              inadequate synergy to facilitate efficiency in the process.
          •   The establishing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the various agencies
              would provide for coordination, and awareness for all involved of the objective, and
              project-cycle of the intervention, and their responsibility/time-lines in this pursuit.
Public Safety Enhancement and Capacity Building:
Building Community Capacity through Community-Based Contracting:
          •   Differences in “baseline” capacities require design approaches suitable to the needs and
              capabilities of the communities. Hence, for example in the Zinc Fence Removal and
              Substitution, the national competitive bidding (NCB) (i.e., “traditional”) method of
              procuring a Contractor was used in Shelter Rock, while in Flanker where there was a
              greater capacity, the CBC method was used for implementation.
          •   Community-based contracting is an important option to nurture and develop community
              capacity through “on-the-job-training. The ICBSP experience shows that the relevant
              question is not whether CBC is better than traditional methods, but rather in which
              circumstances and communities one method is preferable. However, until confidence is
              built sufficiently within the CBOs, staff may be initially resistant to recommend this
              method of implementation for building capacity.
          •   Some of the challenges noted in undertaking CBC are as follows:
          •   Even though the CBC method is highly recommended for building community groups’
              capacity, the methodology has negative impact on timely and efficient completion of
              subprojects.
          •   Difficulties compelling stakeholders to produce necessary documentation in a timely
              fashion meant that budget estimates for the quarter were difficult to make/meet.
          •   Many CBO members are volunteers and are doing the documentation in their spare time.
              Stipends to allow for the payment of administrative staff on the subprojects generally
              allow for more thorough documentation and more timely submission.
          •   Additional administrative support for photocopying and filing of CBC documentation is
              needed.
          •   Highlight for other projects: Other World Bank projects have experienced difficulties
              making sizeable impacts in urban environments. But in the urban environments in which
              the ICBSP works, CDD processes have specifically targeted poorer community residents,
              have reached sizeable numbers of beneficiaries, and have made gains in capacity
              building.
          •   Highlight for other projects: CBC as a method builds capacity in the groups but also
              requires additional time built into project timelines to take into account the challenges
              described. Many sets of tranche documentation produced by the CBOs were returned,
                                                                                                     58
             sometimes (up to 4 times) before the required documentation is correct and complete.
             The experience of the ICBSP has triggered a number of changes to how CBC is handled,
             namely i) the administrative burdens on the community groups going forward will be
             reduced as template booklets for financial management will be provided with the grant ii)
             the former will also improve the quality of documents produced as greater consistency
             and conformance will occur and iii) the management of the tranche and how they are
             disbursed will be better tagged to activities and submission of documentation will be
             incremental as opposed to being submitted at the time of tranche request.
         • Highlight for other projects: The JSDF implemented a component using NGOs to support
             crime prevention activities in peripheral communities to the ICBSP. This allowed for
             increase in coverage to beneficiaries of like interventions to the vulnerable and it
             provided an opportunity for the NGOs to build their institutional capacity and profile in
             crime prevention and community development work.
Youth Education and Recreation:
          •   There is continued need for: (i) the use of technology to deliver curriculum in centres and
              (ii) capacity building of schools to deliver remedial education by investing in school labs
              and software.
          •   Highlight for other projects: The education programmes run by the ICBSP have reported
              significant community-buy in—across urban, peri-urban and rural areas. In all ICBSP
              communities, these popular programmes consistently have more applicants than
              programme resources are able to support. Community focus groups indicate that the
              ICBSP’s education programmes are highly regarded by the communities; preliminary
              analyses have indicated high stakeholder satisfaction, particularly for parents and
              students. The high level of satisfaction and strengthened capacity of the Community
              Committees will improve likelihood of sustainability.
Mediation & Conflict Resolution:
          •   Highlight for other projects: The beneficiary numbers for the Mediation and Conflict
              Resolution programme have been significantly higher than expected, exceeding targets
              by over 400%. The variety of the activities that have been incorporated has increased the
              interventions’ interest to the various at-risk groups. These activities have included:
              psychosocial interventions, life skills training through sports, sensitization sessions that
              incorporate cultural activities, sessions with rival gangs for the establishment of
              Community Stabilisation Youth Alliances and Community Stabilisation Agreements, and
              income-generating activities, among other interventions. Individual interventions tend to
              be multifaceted, such as the psychosocial interventions, which have incorporated
              beneficiary assessments, life skills training and psychological counselling, and are
              expected to result in significant behavioural change.
Alternative Livelihoods and Skills Development:
          •   Highlight for other projects: Through this component, over 1,500 beneficiaries have
              received access to skills training programmes (in both traditional and non-traditional
              fields) and income-generation opportunities. Some participants have advanced through
              the HEART Trust/NTA-NCTVET Level 1 certification to progress to the second level.

                                                                                                       59
The vocational skills programme has also been a model of partnership with both public
and private-sector institutions: in addition to its partnerships with numerous CBOs, the
Alternative Livelihoods programme has partnered with nine skills-training institutions,
including the University of Technology, to endow community residents with
employment-ready skills.

Annex B: JSIF’s Commitment to Gender Mainstreaming

      The Jamaica Social Investment Fund (JSIF) is among twelve Government of Jamaica Ministries,
Departments and Agencies that have been gender certified by the Bureau of Gender Affairs, a
Department that falls under the Office of the Prime Minister.

        The Gender Certification seeks to facilitate the implementation of the National Policy for Gender
Equality (NPGE) and the process of gender mainstreaming. The purpose of the certification is to create
greater gender awareness as well as strengthen the capacity of organizations to deliver equitable services
both internally and externally. With this certification, the JSIF demonstrates that its operations are
gender-compliant and that it recognises the value of gender mainstreaming as a vital component of its
day-to-day operations. The stamp also demonstrates that the JSIF is committed to addressing obstacles
to gender equality.

        The principles of the NPGE guides the Project Appraisal process, ensuring that the greatest
needs of all beneficiaries are addressed, with special consideration given to gender-specific
circumstances and needs. In following the guidelines of the Gender Certification, the JSIF is also aware
of Millennium Development Goal #3, which speaks specifically to empowering women and tries to
ensure that an appropriate gender balance is met in all interventions.
