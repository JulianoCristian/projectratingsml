               ICBSP – Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework
                Abbreviated Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plan

                     ARP Knollis Multipurpose Building & Field


Project Information

The community of Knollis located in Bog Walk, St. Catherine has been appraised for a
Football field under the ICBSP project. The football field is to be located as seen below.
The footprint of the football field with the multipurpose building encroaches on a
property to the east. The actual project has two components, a multipurpose centre and a
newly proposed upgraded football field. The original proposal was to construct only a
multipurpose building to the south of an existing football field, however the community
has requested and that space be left for an upgraded (regulation size) football field. Even
though this was not seen as part of the original activities the sustainability of the
multipurpose court and the benefit to the community would be greatly advanced with the
development of the football field. The football field will also add justification to the
newly upgraded road that will serve as an access to the multipurpose centre.

Alternatives

The first alternative would be to build the multipurpose court only and eliminate the issue
of encroachment; this however would result in the community not having an upgraded
football field in the future. This would be counter to the project’s efforts to promote
community development.

Attempts were also made to re-orient the field or decrease its size in order to negate the
need to relocate or acquire land; however given the strong desire to have a regulation
sized field, and the impracticality of re-orientation; land acquisition became the best
option.

Land Information

The land area in question is on a GoJ owned parcel (Vol:Folio XXX) with land valuation
number XXXXX. The specific land area to be affected is approximately 800 sq ft, of
which 200 sq ft of this consists of a community access path, the remaining 600 sq ft being
the affected dwelling area and crops.


Socio-economic Data

This property facilitates both dwelling and farming activities; a XXXX resides at the
location and has done so for the past seven (7) years. The XXXX is involved in the
farming of various crops and these will be disturbed as a result of the project activities, as
such compensation will be calculated in terms of three (3) years production. The crops
are as follows:
    - 10 Banana plants
    - 30 Cassava roots
    - 15 Cane roots
    - 4 Coconut trees
    - 50 Dasheen roots

The *calculations for compensation are as follows:

   -   One (1) banana plant consists of three shoots, each shoot producing 1 bunch /
       year. One (1) bunch has the equivalent of 9 doz. Therefore his 10 plants will
       produce 30 (10x30) bunches / year, i.e. 270 (30x9) doz. Bananas; 1 doz = J$120.
       The 10 banana plants over three (3) years are valued at J$32,400 (270 x 120)

   -   20,000kg of Cassava is produced per hectare with total input cost of J$190,000,
       one hectare produces 20,000kg /year and sale price is J$10/lb. For three (3) years
       the crop is valued at approximately J$15,000.




/lm 10.04.08
   -   Each cane has 10 canes roots, therefore 15 canes consist of 150 roots (10x15),
       each root sells for J$100, the total value is J$15,000 (150x100) / year or J$45,000
       over three (3) years.


   -   One (1) coconut tree produces approximately 100 / year, each coconut cost J$65,
       there for earnings per year will total J$6,500 and J$32,500 over five (5) years.

   -   20,000kg of Dasheen is produced per hectare with total input cost of J$340,000,
       one hectare produces 25,000kg /year and sale price is J$15/lb. For three (3) years
       the crop is valued at approximately J$45,000.

About the Land and its structures

The land area in question is approximately 6 acres of which the property with house have
fenced off approximately ¼ acre. The individual to be affected is situated on an area of
land having a single room wooden dwelling, with agricultural crops.

Compensation

JSIF proposes to provide appropriate compensation for the relocation including the re-
construction cost and labour. There are a number of elements that will attract a cost:

   -   Labour to remove structure 1 day @ $1500 / dy for 2 labourers = $3,000
   -   Dumping of materials = $5,000
   -   Transportation of materials = $5,000
   -   Labour & Materials to reconstruct house 12 x 12 = $120,000
   -   Crop value = J$169,500

TOTAL = J$302,500




Consultations with Displaced Person

JSIF Social Officers (SOs) as well as Community Liaison Officers (CLOs) have had a
number of discussions with the community as it relates to the nature of the JSIF
interventions. These were as part of the regular JSIF consultations. In addition the CLOs
are in constant dialogue with the community and specifically the individual to be
relocated. In addition to these consultations, they have attended the regular community
meetings and provided information on the matter.

The decision to relocate was made no more than three (3) weeks to the date of this ARP,
when the designs were finalized. The CLO has had discussions with the affected person
(AP) and has spoken with the person who will be affected. This person has expressed a
willingness to relocate in order to facilitate the well needed development in the
community.


Implementation and Grievances Resolution

JSIF’s assigned Social and Community Liaison Officers will play a critical role in this
aspect of the project to ensure that application of the framework is a smooth one. The
sharing of information in a timely manner and the quick attention to issues that arise are
seen as keys to good social management, JSIF mode of operation ensures that an officer
(CLO) is always on the ground and as such issues arising will be heard as some as they
arise. The CLO is trained to manage certain issues, and where issues are outside of the
officer’s scope, it must be reported to the relevant persons within JSIF. JSIF has a policy
that speaks to arbitration for the settling of grievances. The implementation plan will be
followed so that activities are carried out in timely manner with due notice to the affected
persons.

ARP Implementation and Monitoring


The EO with responsibility for resettlement will ensure that the relocation process i.e.
from removal of property from the structure to the demolition is a smooth one. The Social
Officer along with the CLO will ensure that any issues that arise or are presented to them
by the owner of the property is recorded and settled in accordance with JSIF’s grievance
guidelines and the LARPF. They must also ensure that the EO is kept informed and
written reports sent for placement on the LARPF files (Fund Manager).

The following information will be noted and recorded on Fund Manager:

- Census Data
- Dates of all stages of ARP approval i.e. JSIF and Bank
- Date of disclosure of ARP
- Grievances, issues, resolution etc.
- Compensation paid
