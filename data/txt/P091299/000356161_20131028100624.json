For JSIF funded community projects, the Policy\n            Framework will supplement existing Jamaican law pertaining\n            to land acquisition and resettlement by introducing\n            additional compensation measures to achieve compensation at\n            replacement cost together with implementation and\n            consultation arrangements to minimize land acquisition\n            impacts and obtain the informed consent of those affected by\n            land acquisition.  The Policy Framework will form part of\n            JSIF's Operational Manual for community projects. While\n            the infrastructure investments funded by the project are not\n            expected to involve any significant land acquisition and\n            displacement, they may require access to limited areas of\n            land either temporarily during construction or permanently\n            for specific community projects. Such land may either be\n            furnished through voluntary private land donations,\n            transactions between willing-seller-willing-buyer, donations\n            of vacant government land, or involuntary land acquisition\n            based on eminent domain. Community projects that would\n            involve resettlement of more than 10 families are not\n            eligible for JSIF funding.  Property and asset valuation\n            will consider the market value at the date of service of\n            notice. Compensation measures include a preference for\n            issuing land for land in case acquisition of either\n            residential, business, or agricultural land causes\n            displacement; assistance provided to tenants and squatters\n            to find alternative accommodations; income restoration and\n            damages sustained by persons injured during the taking of\n            possession which affects their actual earnings; reasonable\n            expenses incidental to any change of residence or place of\n            business; losses of crops and trees; and interest on\n            compensation not paid or deposited before taking possession\n            of the land."}, "docdt": "2013-10-22T00:00:00Z"}
