The project development objective is to improve quality of life in 12 Jamaican inner-city areas and poor

electricity, roads, drainage and related community infrastructure for over 60,000 residents of poor urban
informal settlements through capital investments and innovative arrangements for operations and
maintenance; (b) facilitate access to microfinance for enterprise development and incremental home
improvement for entrepreneurs and residents in project areas; (c) increase security of tenure for eligible
households in project areas; and (d) enhance public safety through mediation services, community capacity
building, skills training and related social services.
