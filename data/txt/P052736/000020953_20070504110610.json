Some lessons learned\n            included: 1) Building up a successful institution is\n            time-consuming and challenging and requires close Bank\n            supervision, especially during changes of Government\n            administration; 2) Closing an institution implies a thorough\n            review of all its assets; 3) Internet community centers\n            require a specific use; 4) Approval processes within an\n            institution must be designed bearing in mind that there is a\n            tradeoff between time and exhaustiveness; 5) A good Spectrum\n            Monitoring and Administration System (SMAS) requires more\n            than just the equipment; 6) Mobile networks are very active\n            and expand in a timely manner; 7) Cross-sector projects\n            require commitment and coordination from all involved\n            parties; and 8) It is better to have an independent\n            regulator. However, it must be said that, in the case of\n            Dominican Republic, this fact did not became an obstacle\n            that hindered the development of the project."}, "docdt": "2007-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
