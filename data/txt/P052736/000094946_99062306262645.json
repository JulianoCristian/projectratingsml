constraints to private sector development and\n            increase basic infrastructure coverage, the\n            Telecommunications Regulatory Reform Project will strengthen\n            the policy, legal, and, regulatory environment in the\n            telecommunications sector. It will also improve rural access\n            to services through private sector investments. The four\n            main components will: 1) create new telecommunications\n            regulatory measures, drafting regulations for\n            interconnection agreements, licenses, resolution of\n            disputes, as well as radio frequency use and management,\n            and, different types of existing and new services. Tariffs\n            will be reviewed, in addition, design and administration of\n            the Fund for the Development of Telecommunications (FDT)\n            will be implemented; 2) create an autonomous\n            telecommunications regulatory entity, through the\n            appointment of executive management and staff, and define\n            organizational functions. Procurement of monitoring\n            equipment, and, office/computer equipment will be provided,\n            together with technical assistance; 3) transfer regulatory\n            functions to the Dominican Institute of Telecommunications\n            (INDOTEL) upon the closure of the Directorate General of\n            Telecommunications (DGT), and, severance compensation will\n            be funded; 4) finance and manage the project management unit\n            and INDOTEL, to include project audits."}, "docdt": "1999-06-10T00:00:00Z"}
