The\n            project's approach to biodiversity conservation is\n            based on community participation. The participatory approach\n            will be carried out through the coordination with national,\n            governorate, and local level institutions. Some of the\n            project components may trigger the Bank's policy on\n            involuntary resettlement, which also includes specific\n            provision for the loss of access to natural resources in\n            parks and protected areas. To achieve its objectives of\n            biodiversity conservation, the project may require the\n            restriction of access to the resources in the defined core\n            areas that are currently utilized by the population. The\n            Park Management Team (PMT) for each protected area will be\n            the main executors of the process framework. During the\n            project implementation, when conflicting views concerning\n            the utilization of resources arise, the Development\n            Committee and PMT will be the forum for dispute resolution.\n            If no acceptable solutions can be reached, claims will be\n            presented to the Local Development Council. Should conflicts\n            still remain, the claims will be settled by the Regional\n            Development Council. The execution of the process framework\n            will be monitored by the Project Management Unit."}, "docdt": "2002-03-14T00:00:00Z"}
