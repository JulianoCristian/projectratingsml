MANAGEMENT PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Protected Areas\n            Management Project for Tunisia were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, the risk to global environment outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: coupling park\n            management activities with local partnerships and awareness\n            raising programs has a strong positive impact on improving\n            community perceptions. The project demonstrated that the\n            partnerships with schools, research institutions, media and\n            local private sector helped solidify the collaborative\n            spirit towards nature conservation objectives in each of the\n            regions, improved the understanding and positive perceptions\n            of the local people and significantly reduced the number of\n            illegal activities. Among the three parks, Jbil proved to be\n            more challenging in this aspect given the small number of\n            communities, many of which are not settled. In future, a\n            dedicated awareness strategy based on the specific\n            characteristics of each park is merited. Fostering local\n            partnerships for knowledge generation of the existing\n            biodiversity in a park enhances its management capacity.\n            Rather than mobilizing a large scale technical assistance,\n            the Project Management Unit (PMU) has contracted several\n            research institutes, science faculties and consultants to\n            carry out small-scale analytical works on very specific\n            subject matters. This approach showed that a very rich and\n            useful information base could be obtained at a lower cost\n            than with classical technical assistance, and engages local\n            institutions for more sustainable partnership relations. It\n            is important to manage expectations about what can be\n            achieved in a first phase of a participatory natural\n            resources management project. The project required\n            significant time and resources to set up the participatory\n            planning methodology, with a strong element of learning by\n            doing as it went forward. Also, there was a need to bring\n            the parks to a level where the minimum infrastructure\n            required for receiving increased visitor numbers are in\n            place. These are prerequisites to the launch of successful\n            eco-tourism activities, which require more sophisticated\n            institutional collaboration structures across different\n            sectors and can be envisaged in a follow-on phase."}, "docdt": "2009-08-25T00:00:00Z"}
