F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective of the proposed loan, credit and GEF trust fund grant is to establish viable
reef management systems in at least six priority Districts, through a financially
sustainable program that is nationally coordinated but decentralized in implementation, in
order to empower and to support coastal communities to sustainably co-manage the use
of coral reefs and associated ecosystem resources, which will revive damaged or preserve
intact coral reef ecosystems and in turn, enhance the welfare of these communities in
Indonesia.

1. Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Indonesia spans a larger archipelago than any other country, and contains at least 5.1
million hectares of coral reefs. This is roughly 51 percent of the coral reefs in Southeast
Asia and 18 percent of the world‘s coral reefs. The Indonesian coastal and marine sector,
and in particular the small-scale fisheries supported by coral reef ecosystems, is a
significant productive asset for the country and the millions of poor fishers dependent on
them. However, almost two-thirds (65%) of Indonesia‘s coral reefs are considered
threatened from overfishing, and almost half are considered threatened specifically from
destructive fishing practices.

In the face of this rapid deterioration of its coral reefs, the government of Indonesia (GoI)
identified coral reef ecosystem management as a national priority in the mid-1990s and
requested the Bank‘s assistance to finance a three-phase Adaptable Program Loan (APL),
called the Coral Reef Rehabilitation and Management Program (COREMAP). The GoI‘s
medium-term development strategy (PROPENAS) and the Guidelines of State Policy
(1999-2004) supported a coastal and marine sector policy which includes efficient and
sustainable management of maritime resources, rehabilitation of damaged coastal and
marine ecosystems, and improvement of the socio-economic conditions of coastal
communities. Moreover, a new Ministry for Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) was
established in 1999 with the mandate to ensure sustainable use of Indonesia‘s coastal
ecosystems.

Following the success of COREMAP Phase I (outcome rated satisfactory by both the ICR
and the Independent Evaluation Group), COREMAP Phase II (herein after referred as the
project or COREMAP II) was intended to contribute to the GoI‘s objectives of (i)
sustainable utilization of the coastal ecosystem; (ii) decentralized natural resource
management; and (iii) raising income levels and improving living standards in the coastal
zone and on small islands, particularly in small-scale fishing communities, through
marine reserves. Through collaborative management partnerships, the project aimed to
help rejuvenate coral reef fisheries and diversify the livelihood opportunities of
participating program fishing communities. The Indonesia Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) set the context for the project by shifting focus from an approach of protecting the
poor to one of empowering the poor. With this shift, the CAS sought to address the core
issue of governance in Indonesia, as well as achieve two objectives: (i) to improve the
investment climate, and (ii) to make service delivery responsive to the poor.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The objective of the project is to establish viable reef management systems in at least six
priority Districts, through a financially sustainable program that is nationally coordinated
but decentralized in implementation, in order to empower and to support coastal
communities to sustainably co-manage the use of coral reefs and associated ecosystem



                                              1
resources, which will revive damaged or preserve intact coral reef ecosystems and in turn,
enhance the welfare of these communities in Indonesia.

1.3 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

Formally there was no separate GEO because the global environment objectives were
integrated into the PDO. The PAD Data Sheet included only one statement of objectives,
which was in turn used for both the GEF grant agreement and the IDA credit agreement.
Likewise, there was only one set of key indicators, which applied to the integrated
PDO/GEO objectives.

However, it is useful to note that the elements of the statement of objectives most closely
related to environmental goals were to help revive damaged reefs, preserve intact reefs,
and improve sustainable use of coral reefs and associated ecosystems. These objectives
would be achieved through, and in conjunction with, the project objectives of establishing
community-based reef management systems, strengthening national capacity and
coordination, and empowering and providing benefits to coastal communities.

The seven key performance indicators (KPIs included in PAD‘s Technical Annex 3) at
appraisal were:

       Management and Empowerment Indicators
       1. Collaboratively managed marine conservation areas cover 10 % of program
          district reefs by the end of project (EOP).
       2. Seventy percent of operating costs of program activities fully integrated into
          target district Government programs and funded independent of COREMAP
          II by EOP.
       3. Awareness about the importance of coral reefs increases to and/or maintained
          at 70 % in all program districts.

       Biophysical Indicators
       4. Live coral cover in program districts increases by 5 % annually until levels are
          reached and maintained comparable to those of similar reefs in well-managed
          or pristine areas.
       5. Average catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) for early-breeding indicator species
          harvested by each of the main sustainable fishing techniques in program
          districts increases 35% by EOP, while average CPUE for medium-size
          indicator species harvested by each of the main sustainable fishing techniques
          in program districts increases by 10% by EOP.

       Socio-economic and poverty indicators
       6. Total income received from, and the total number of people receiving their
          income from, sustainable reef-based and reef-substitute activities in program
          districts increases by 10 % by EOP.
       7. At least 70% of fishers/ beneficiaries in coastal communities in program
          districts perceive the program has had a positive impact on their welfare and
          economic status by EOP.


                                            2
1.4 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The PDO was not revised. However, because the original Development Credit
Agreement and GEF Grant Agreement had used a slightly modified version of the PDO,
the language in the legal agreements was amended in the June 2010 restructuring to
correspond to the PDO in the PAD. (The variant of the PDO in the original legal
documents was ―to assist the Borrower in implementing the second phase of COREMAP,
in particular, enhancing the welfare of coastal communities through the establishment of
viable coral reef management systems consisting of a program aimed at empowering and
supporting coastal communities to co-manage, in a sustainable manner, the use of coral
reefs and associated ecosystem resources.‖)

The wordings of KPI 1 and 7 were changed slightly, while maintaining the key concepts.
Three of the KPI (4, 5 and 6) were formally revised at restructuring. The target values of
two biophysical indicators were unrealistic (i.e., to restore live coral in the entire program
district to the level found in pristine ecosystems, and to increase average catch per unit
effort of indicator species by 35% by EOP) and/or outside the control of the project (e.g.,
did not allow for effects of ocean warming and acidification). One socio-economic
indicator (KPI 6) was revised and simplified to be more measurable and to fully capture
benefits from revolving fund activities (regardless of whether they supported reef or reef-
substitution activities). The new indicators were as follows:

       1. Collaboratively managed fully-protected no-take zones, covering 10%, on
          average, of reefs in all project managed areas by EOP.
       4. Significant improvements in live coral cover in project managed areas relative
          to non-project areas, in 80% of samples sites.
       5. Reef fish population improved based on catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) of
          fishers using traditional reef fishing gear and/or visual census in selected
          project sites at EOP in 80 % of sample sites, compared to expected decline in
          control areas (outside project areas).
       6. Total income of project beneficiary group members increased by 10% by EOP.
       7. At least 70% of fishers/ beneficiaries in coastal communities in program
          managed areas perceive the project has had a positive impact on their welfare.

1.5 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The combined GEO/PDO was not revised, but the statement of objectives used in the
legal agreements included some minor discrepancies that were corrected to make them
fully consistent with the PAD (see Section 1.4).

1.6 Main Beneficiaries

The program‘s direct target beneficiaries were 358 coastal communities in seven districts:
(1) Selayar; (2) Pangkep; (3) Sikka; (4) Buton; (5) Wakatobi; (6) Biak; and (7) Raja
Ampat. These districts were selected because they included communities which were


                                              3
affected by pervasive poverty and extensive degradation of coastal resources. The
beneficiaries were highly dependent on small-scale reef fishing for their livelihood, with
many claiming that their income from fishing was not sufficient to meet even their basic
subsistence needs. Many of the target communities used destructive and illegal fishing
methods (cyanide and blast fishing) in an attempt to increase fish catches.

By providing benefits to these communities, the project intended to reduce economic
pressures that contributed to unsustainable fishing practices, while also fostering
awareness of the longer term economic benefits of sustainable use and building support
for improved coral reef management. The environmental outcome of improved reef
health and sustainability would not only benefit these coastal communities, but broader
local, regional, and global interests as well.

1.7 Original Components (as approved)1

Component A: Institutional Strengthening (US$16.6)
The objective of this component was to enhance government institutional responsiveness
to meet the needs of coastal communities, in support of collaborative management of
marine reserves and other marine protected areas. Key activities under this component
include: (i) Program Coordination, M&E, and Training; (ii) Coral Reef Research and
Monitoring - CRITC; and (iii) Legal, Policy and Strategy Assistance. This component
was designed to enhance capacity of participating institutions while promoting policies
on decentralization and co-management of coral reefs and associated ecosystems through
technical assistance, human resource development, and legal input to support
decentralization in managing coral reefs.

Component B: Community Based and Collaborative Management (US$41.6 million)
The objective of this component was to empower all coastal communities and institutions
throughout program districts, through legal means codifying community management
plans along with technical and financial assistance, to sustainably co-manage coral reefs
and associated ecosystems. This would lead to higher productivity and increased incomes,
which would, in turn, enhance community welfare. The project aimed to replace short-
term exploitative practices with the tools and knowledge to generate more sustained
benefit flows from better management practices. The objective was to empower local
governments and coastal communities in the seven districts to manage extensive and bio-
diverse coral reef ecosystems in a cost-effective and sustainable way.

The component aimed to build community-based institutions and coral reef co-
management capacity among the target communities, while also improving their
livelihood base, by (i) setting up Coral Reef Management Committees (LPSTK) at each

  Note: these component totals were identified in the PAD as base costs. They do not include price
contingencies for inflation, etc., estimated at 6%, included in the final Loan Agreement.




                                                  4
village that in turn would support four community groups (pokmas) on the topics of
production, gender, conservation, and monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS), (ii)
preparing and implementing Community-based Coral Reef Management Plans under the
leadership of LPSTK and pokmas, (iii) providing village grants for building small-scale
infrastructure and providing equipments; and (iv) establishing community-based
revolving funds for alternative income generation (AIG) activities. At the same time, the
project would provide support to develop management capacity of District Marine
Conservation Areas and National Marine Parks under the Ministry of Forestry,
Directorate General of Forest Protection and Nature Conservation (PHKA).

Component C: Public Awareness, Education and Sea Partnership (US$11.7 million)
The objective of this component was to increase societal awareness of the benefits of
coral reef ecosystem conservation and sustainable use, which would in turn lead to
behavioral change. It would empower children and youth through an education and
scholarship program to help them move away from behaviors destructive to coral reefs,
benefit key stakeholders through advocacy, and strengthen local governments and
communities through technical assistance and awareness campaigns. Key activities
included (i) public awareness campaigns through dissemination of coral reef advocacy
information through the media, (ii) education programs to produce coral reef education
materials for formal primary and secondary education curriculum in each program district,
program district teacher training, and national reef education events for children and
youth, and (iii) a Sea Partnership Program for secondary, university and graduate
scholarships, and post-education placement to support program activities and expansion
of the existing practical field training program to support village-based activities.

1.8 Revised Components

The components were not revised.

1.9 Other significant changes

The project was restructured in October 2009 and June 2010 (both were second-order,
approved by the country director). The first restructuring extended the closing date by
one year, to December 31, 2010. This was considered an interim extension to allow time
to finalize the specifics and complete the processing of a more substantive restructuring
to address issues that were delaying implementation progress and to improve the
likelihood of fully achieving the project objectives. These included the root causes of
delayed disbursement and poor procurement. Among these were delays in allocation of
the budget (DIPA) from Central to District Level Government in order to co-finance
certain project activities; weak procurement capacity among NCU staff owing to
complicated Bank procurement policies which were not aligned with Government
policies or the ADB‘s for that matter, and delays in decentralized financial management
accounting and reporting.

The second and more substantive restructuring involved: (i) extending the closing date
by another year—through December 2011; (ii) cancelling a portion of the loan
($3,002,374 in IBRD funds) at the request of the GOI and reallocating the remaining


                                            5
proceeds to streamline implementation; and (iii) modifying some KPIs based on
recommendations from the MTR and reinforced by the new Bank Task Team (see section
1.3.1). Another significant change included reducing the total number of villages in
which COREMAP II would be implemented from 416 to 357. The revisions were based
on recommendations from the MTR which called for reducing the number of new
communities to receive COREMAP assistance to the number in which core activities
could be successfully rolled out without compromising the quality of implementation.
The total number of communities in Eastern Indonesia in which COREMAP II would be
implemented via a decentralized approach was agreed to be 357. The number of districts
involved increased from six to seven because one of the original districts was split,
creating a new, 7th district (Wakatobi).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of background analysis. Background analysis was very robust. As the second
phase in an APL, the project incorporated the lessons learned in COREMAP-I as well as
the lessons that contributed to the original design of the APL. The first phase was
assessed not only through the Bank‘s normal ICR process, but was also the subject of a
detailed review by the Bank‘s Operations Evaluation Department (OED), and an
independent evaluation by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
Additional lessons, both positive and negative, were also derived from other Bank and
non-Bank projects or initiatives involving community empowerment in general and
community participation in natural resources management and conservation in particular.
Some of the key design considerations drawn from these lessons were focused on
decentralizing resources and decision making to the local level wherever possible,
approaching coral reef management as an integral part of community development rather
than a compartmentalized problem, and developing transparent and accountable village-
based financial management mechanisms.

Assessment of project design. Although the objectives, components, organization, and
financing arrangements for the project were well aligned with country priorities and
generally well designed, there were some shortcomings related to project complexity and
scope that emerged later. These raised questions at the MTR about the realism of design,
given the institutional capacity, and implementation environment for decentralized
execution of a project this complex.

A key challenge in Phase II was how to scale up the pilot initiatives in Phase I and
promote a decentralized development strategy with a community-centered approach,
while also involving numerous agencies, and strengthening the capacity of COREMAP
districts in order to achieve collaborative management. This challenge was translated into
a new set of institutional arrangements involving three implementing agencies at the
national level, vertical integration across four levels of government, and seven districts.
These included 357 coastal communities, spanning a vast ocean area. The project
included 3 components, 12 subcomponents, and 63 distinct activities in a project area



                                             6
spanning vast distances with the aim of achieving environmental, socio-economic
development, and poverty alleviation objectives. The complexity of administrative and
financial systems at both the central and district government level added further
challenges. Despite seeming to depart from the objective of keeping things simple and
decentralized, the implementing agencies ultimately agreed (during the interview at the
ICR) that such a complex design was largely unavoidable, and indeed necessary to
achieve the project objective.

Areas where the project design could have been strengthened include the definition of
KPIs and design of the alternative income generation (AIG) subcomponent. Expectations
for the impact of the AIG activity were probably too high relative to the financial and
technical resources committed to it. The PAD did not specifically detail the mechanism
for delivering AIG improvements among the target communities nor set out a clear
guidelines to operate the revolving funds at the village level. In addition, some project
KPIs were unrealistic or not clearly defined, especially the biophysical indicators, which
led to confusion during implementation about designing methodologies to measure them.
The issues are discussed in more detail in other sections.

Government commitment. Government commitment during preparation was very good,
both at the national and district levels. Participation in the design of the APL, as well as
implementation of the first phase, along with stakeholder consultations, strengthened the
foundation for the government‘s engagement during preparation of phase two. The
borrower‘s views and insights (and in some cases reservations) were valuable in
designing phase two, and in particular defining the appropriate institutional arrangements.

Assessment of risks. The PAD lists the number of covenants – Conditions of Negotiations,
based on the identified risks. It also covers implementation issues based on lessons
learned from COREMAP I and other Bank projects. Critical risks and possible
controversial aspects lay out the issues and counter-measures clearly. While assessment
of the risks identified was appropriate, the PAD failed to flag implementation risks
associated with a project as complex as this one, particularly given the novel
implementation arrangements and the challenges inherent in a decentralized approach.

2.2 Implementation

The most notable setback in implementation was the long delay (about two and a half
years) in getting meaningful implementation underway. The main factors contributing to
this delay were:

Within government and project control:
   (i) Change of implementation modality from the first to second phase of the APL.
        The Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) implemented COREMAP-I activities
        and funds as a centrally managing and coordinating project, while COREMAP-II
        adopted a decentralized mode.
   (ii) Lengthy process required for changes to national budget authorizations (known
        as DIPA) required for release of both counterpart and Bank/donor financing,



                                             7
         combined with disconnect between timing of project and government budget
         timetables and planning.
   (iii) Lack of familiarity with Bank‘s administrative and procurement procedures by
         project implementers.

Outside of government and project control:
   (iv) Logistical challenges associated with the vast spatial coverage by the project.


   (v) High costs incurred to immediate follow-up to solve problems because of
        distance, poor communication tools available with remote communities and
        travel requirements.
   (vi) Sudden bankruptcy of the consulting firm hired to provide technical assistance to
        the project.

Project at risk status and corrective action. During the first several years of
implementation, ratings in the project status reports were slow to reflect these
implementation problems and tended to anticipate near-term improvements in
performance that did not materialize. Even after the ratings were lowered, they still did
not show the project in problem status, largely due to reasonably good progress on two of
the main project components (Institution Strengthening and Public Awareness), which
was not matched by convincing progress on the component most closely linked to the
project objective (Community-Based Collaborative Management).

As a result, the project did not officially fall into problem status until early 2010, when a
short-term extension had already been approved and preparation was well underway on
the terms of a restructuring that would help address underlying issues and get the project
back on track. This was more an adjustment of the ratings than a change in performance,
and came at a time when considerable supervision effort had already been put into the
project and performance was actually improving. The mid-term review, conducted
toward the end of the initial delays provided a set of good recommendations, which
contributed to the restructuring proposal and improvements in project performance. The
restructuring, combined with the closing date extensions, gave the project the footing and
the time required to recover from its initial delays, provide effective support to the
community-based and collaborative coral-reef management (CBM) component, and
achieve its objectives.

Key factors that contributed to this turnaround and the project‘s ultimate success include:
(i) proactive attitudes among project implementers to deal with issues; (ii) strong
ownership among local stakeholders; (iii) the hiring of an Executive Advisor to handle
day to day operations; (iv) the linkage between the promotion of CBM at the village
levels and the constant information dissemination through public awareness campaigns
and educational programs.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design: The seven KPIs were designed to measure the PDO‘s achievements in the three
aspects: (i) management and empowerment; (ii) biophysical; and (iii) socio-economic and
poverty. In general, the sets of KPIs for the first and last aspects allow a sound validation,
but the two biophysical indicators, albeit revised at the restructuring, are not scientifically
robust enough to determine whether the changes in coral growth and fish population can
be attributed to the project. These two indicators were designed to measure the effects of
improved management of coral reefs primarily through (i) establishment of No-Take
Zones and elimination of destructive fishing in the project area. Because changes in live
coral cover are also influenced by factors outside the control of the project, i.e.,
environmental factors like sea surface temperature, acidification, bleaching and storm
damage (which are related to climate change), it is impossible to ascribe the changes in
live coral cover to project interventions without adequate control plots outside the range
of interventions to compare changes in coral cover to. On the other hand, it is entirely
possible (and quite likely) that coral reefs outside the COREMAP project area actually
suffered declines in coral cover as a result of higher incidence of destructive fishing
practices on these reefs. Thus the difference in live coral cover between project
intervention sites and those reefs outside the Project area—also subject to climate change
impacts—might have been even greater than the positive change in coral cover from
Time 0 to the end of Project recorded in most COREMAP sites.

For fish population, using visual census and CPUE as methods to measure intervention
effectiveness on fish population was also scientifically inappropriate because (i) visual
censuses are useful for biodiversity data but less useful for population trends; (ii) sample
size of CREEL data were too small to gauge program effectiveness on fishing practices
across the entire district; and (iii) CREEL data collection was too inconsistent (e.g.,
schedule, personnel).

COREMAP II developed an Excel based Management Information System (MIS), Form
28, to monitor the periodic progresses of the project. The flexibility of Excel sheets
resulted in inconsistency of the form and data and unnecessary data clearing.

Implementation: The seven KPIs were monitored separately by the NCU and LIPI. The
NCU was mainly responsible for monitoring No.1, 2, and 3, while LIPI was responsible
for measuring the rest of KPIs. LIPI conducted a baseline survey in 2008 and impact
survey in 2010 and 2011.

Each program implementation unit (PIU) had an M&E officer responsible for gathering
and compiling data to be sent to the NCU in monitoring the progress of the project. The
NCU was then responsible for extracting data from the form to prepare progress reports
for the GoI and the Bank. However, the data management at all levels remained weak
throughout the project period and the majority of PIUs failed to submit Form 28 to the
NCU in time. In addition, the NCU was not able to consolidate the data for analysis and
project management due to data inconsistency.




                                              9
In 2011, with technical support from the Bank and FAO cooperative program, the project
reorganized Form 28 and developed: (i) a web-based MIS; (ii) village profiles which
store all village-based activities conducted under component 2; and (iii) a set of project
progress monitoring formats, which greatly improved the quality and utility of the M&E
system, allowing data queries and easy comparisons of outputs and performance across
geographic areas as well as within a given district, down to the Village level. This web-
based M&E System will be put on a GIS platform in housed in LIPI, and eventually be
made available to the public. These improvements in the resolution of performance by
geographic area and the ability to correlate behavior change with management
interventions, will allow future interventions to be targeted where they are needed most
and provided documentation of management effectiveness.

Utilization: M&E implementation, data collection methods, and actual KPI values were
regularly reviewed during the Bank‘s supervision missions, which contributed to
improvements in the M&E arrangements themselves, M&E capacity and performance,
revision of some KPIs, and other elements of the project restructuring (such as
cancellation of some activities and narrower targeting of resources to villages, as well as
confidence in the achievability of objectives and justification of closing date extension).
Despite the revision of the biophysical indicators, both the counterparts and the Bank
recognized that they still had shortcomings even after restructuring. [Design of robust
indicators that can ascribe outcomes to project interventions is a key priority in the design
of the planned third phase of the APL.]

The output data were closely correlated with the expenditures and the NCU used the
expenditure data to understand the level of project outputs. The submission of Form 28
from each implementer was often delayed and the form was not effectively used in
project management or data analysis. This is the same for the web-based MIS due to the
late completion of this tool. But the process of its development helped the NCU to clean
and consolidate the data to be used for the borrower‘s ICR.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Social and Environmental Safeguards

Compliance with social and environmental safeguards was found satisfactory. A training
course on safeguard policies held for the government staff proved to be helpful in
improving awareness of the importance of compliance with the Bank‘s safeguard policies.
The project had the Environmental and Social Impact Management Framework, which
provided a positive and negative list for community infrastructure. Environmentally
harmful projects were largely screened out by using the framework. The followings are
some of examples that the project handled well:

      LPSTK was established at each village to support participatory development of
       Village and Coral Reef Management Plans (RPTK). Establishment of Village No-
       Take Areas (DPLs) on the reef was done with the support of this group, and buy-
       in by the larger community. In the case of Village Information Centers (VIC),



                                             10
       which required land for construction, the LPSTK consulted with landowners to
       identify those who might be willing to contribute land voluntarily without
       compensation for establishment of the VIC. Once agreed, LPSTK issued letters of
       receipt to the land owners, confirming that the contribution of land was voluntary,
       and these were filed with the PMU.
      The Bajo community was identified as Indigenous People in the project area.
       They were well represented in project activities.
      Income generating activities such as sea weed culture and aquaculture were
       carried out in an environmentally friendly way. Village infrastructure, financed by
       village grants, was also developed with minimal damage to the surrounding
       environment.

Procurement

The project‘s procurement performance is found moderately satisfactory. Using the
Bank‘s procurement methods in the national budget authorization (DIPA) context, the
district level budgets were often delayed which proved challenging for procurement of
goods and services. This was a major challenge for items that required the local
counterpart funds. However, the Bank‘s procurement team and the NCU‘s procurement
committee worked collaboratively to accelerate the procurement process after the mid-
term and completed many outstanding issues on procurement by the project closure.
Refresher courses on procurement held for Program Management Unit (PMU) staff in
early 2011 proved to be helpful in improving the understanding of the important of
compliance with procurement policy. However, it may be more efficient in the future (i.e.,
Phase 3) to avoid local level procurement and focus on building capacity at the level of
the NCU.

Financial Management

The project‘s financial management performance is found moderately satisfactory.
Initially, the project was: (a) delayed in submission of the project financial reports; (b)
slow in progress in resolving the backlogged items; and (c) slow in response in resolving
audit findings. These weaknesses were also found in village-grant book-keeping and seed
fund management at the community level. This was improved from 2010, after the
updated financial management manual was finally issued and additional training was
provided to the village coral reef management committee (LPTSK) and village micro
saving and credit union (LKM). The project also made efforts to improve the timing of
financial reporting, resolve backlogs, and follow up on audit findings. The project audit
reports were consistently submitted on time to the Bank.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The GoI allocated budgets to keep a group of core staff of the NCU for the C3
preparation. The request for C3 has already been submitted to the Bank as well as to the
national planning agency (BAPPENAS). Each target district also allocated budgets to




                                            11
maintain core activities to provide direct support to the target villages. The preparation of
C3 is expected to be completed by March 2013.

In parallel with preparation of the COREMAP II ICR, COREMAP III is being prepared
based on the lessons and experience gained from COREMAP II. The APL, anticipated a
three phase program. COREMAP III aims to institutionalize the decentralized
COREMAP model developed under phase II. Building on lessons learned in the
acceleration phase of COREMAP (II), the community co-management model for coral
reef conservation and sustainable use will be simplified and reduced in cost in Phase III,
with an aim to extend the COREMAP model to other districts effectively. In response to
the limited impact of AIGs in phase II, COREMAP III will scale up support for
alternative livelihoods in conjunction with MPA establishment and zoning and permitting
of fishing effort, in light of continued unsustainable levels of fishing pressure on coral
reefs. Support will include production infrastructure, technical and financial assistance
and market access to accelerate uptake of new income generating opportunities leading to
livelihood transformation. It will also continue to strengthen institutions with an emphasis
at the District level, and help shape policies at the national and district level to align
economic incentives with desired behavioral change by coral reef user groups. Phase III
will benefit from improved monitoring and evaluation with adequate controls, and will
seek to shift implementation responsibility away from the national level to provincial and
particularly District level authorities, to embed the COREMAP model in regional and
municipal development plans in coastal hubs across Eastern Indonesia.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The project objectives remain highly relevant to the priorities of Indonesia. Under the
leadership of the President of Indonesia, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the Coral Triangle
Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries, and Food Security (CTI-CFF) was developed with its
neighboring five countries in 2009 and set a 10-year plan of action to address the urgent
threats facing the coastal and marine resources of one of the most biologically diverse
and ecologically rich regions on earth.

Indonesia‘s GDP has been growing at five to six percent annually since 2002, but nearly
half of Indonesia‘s population is still either poor or have per-capita consumption levels of
less than one-third above the national poverty line. As a result, Indonesia may yet fail to
reach several of its Millennium Development Goal targets. As such, improving the
welfare and livelihoods of the poor, including small coastal communities dependent on
degraded natural resources, is still relevant and government‘s priority.

COREMAP II‘s design, based on strengthening national capacity for coordinating
institutions in implementation to provide technical, administrative and managerial
support to the local governments, while supporting GoI‘s decentralization processes at
the district and village levels, remains valid. It is important to note that GOI‘s
commitment to mainstreaming and institutionalizing decentralization and co-management



                                             12
of coral-reef and associated coastal resources remains a priority. The objective of APL
Phase II was decentralization and acceleration. The project design, implementation
arrangements and activities under three components were in line with APL‘s objective
and successfully produced a decentralized COREMAP model and established 358
village-based institutions for collaborative coral reef resource -management.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environment
Objectives

The project‘s development and global environment objectives were combined in a single
statement of objectives with three main elements that can be summarized as: (a)
empowering communities to establish viable reef co-management systems including
decentralized local institutions, plans, regulations and MCS; (b) helping to revive and
preserve coral reefs and their associated eco-systems through establishing community-
implemented Marine Protected Areas (No-Take Zones: DPL); and (c) providing welfare
benefits to coastal communities through small-scale community-based infrastructure
(village block grants) and supplemental income generation through revolving funds.

Management and Empowerment: Satisfactory
The project was able to establish decentralized and legally codified coral reef co-
management systems, including the establishment of community-implemented Marine
Protected Areas (No-Take Zones) in all 7 project districts. As shown in KPI 1, all
districts except for Pangkep managed to establish at least 10% of coral reefs as No Take
Zones as represented by areas in National Parks, district marine protected areas (KKLD),
and Village No Take Zones (DPL). Fifteen percent of the total project managed areas
were designated as DPL (No Take). Furthermore, it was reported that DPL would be
further expanded by 3,000 ha in Raja Ampat, Biak, and Sikka, once these Regional
Protected Areas are zoned. Within locally managed Marine Protected Areas, local
stakeholders were fully involved in the planning and management of the DPLs through
LPSTK supported community groups. Local community groups in partnership with local
governments established a total of 358 Coral Reef Management Plans of which 251 have
so far been approved.

The decentralized approach, in line with national policy reforms to empower local
government to create enabling conditions for sustainable and equitable economic
development in remote locations, was a hallmark of the project. The financial
sustainability of these coral reef co-management systems was strengthened by the
progressive absorption by District Governments (Kabupatens) of project operating costs,
such that by EOP 70% of these costs were funded by local government (see KPI 2).
Anecdotal evidence also shows that all seven districts have allocated budgets to maintain
COREMAP II institutions and personnel as well as monitoring, facilitation and
surveillance (MCS) operations for 2012.

As seen in KPI 3, based on a survey carried out in 2010 in which 420 respondents in
target districts and villages were questioned, this indicator was fully met. An average of
75% of the respondents felt that healthy coral reefs were key to their lives. The level of
awareness was much higher (86%) compared with the population outside of the target
districts. As a result, the incidence of illegal and destructive fishing decreased by 60%
across the project districts. These supporting evidences demonstrate the success of the
project in meeting the objectives of establishing fully protected, collaboratively managed,
decentralized reef management systems.

Biophysical: Moderately Satisfactory

Measurable increases in live coral cover in the majority of reef sites supported by the
project (KPI 4). Overall, monitoring data showed positive trends and seemed to generally
support anecdotal evidences gathered during the ICR mission. As shown in the table
below, there was positive coral cover growth in six of the seven districts through LIPI
monitoring and four of the seven districts through PMU monitoring.2

  LIPI set up permanent plots at each district to monitor the reef health (live coral cover), while each PMU
at the district monitored the reef health at randomly selected village DPLs. Mean live coral cover in village
DPLs was not as high as in the LIPI plots in many districts, nor did it increase as much on average. These
differences can be interpreted in several ways, not the least of which is observer bias (inconsistencies in
data collection in the DPL plots), or inherent differences in environmental conditions at these sites.



                                                     14
As mentioned earlier (see section 2.3 M&E), although positive trends were observed in
the biophysical condition of Project reefs, the two KPIs are insufficient to prove the
attribution of outcomes to project interventions. This was due to a combination of
sampling design problems and data collection issues. However, anecdotal evidence, data
and reports provided by the project suggest that the coral reefs in project sites improved
during the course of the Project. Reefs in Project districts showed a positive trend in live
coral cover as an indicator of coral reef health. Reefs inside and outside No-Take Zones
showed positive overall increases in coral cover in 5 of 7 districts. In the case of
Wakatobi, coral cover was already at a maximum for the region so the 0 change in state is
actually an indicator of success. Improved management of coral reefs was also
demonstrated through a marked decrease in the use of destructive fishing practices (also
see KPI 3 and 7). Half of reported illegal fishing led to successful prosecutions. There
was a strong collaborative MCS effort including community training, formation of
community support groups (Pokmas), training for fisheries inspectors, and coordination
workshops, and establishment of a radio system to support enforcement activities. Cases
of illegal fishing led to successful prosecution rates of: 100% in Buton, Wakatobi, and
Sikka; 70% in Pangkep; and 12% in Selayar.

The data on status of reef fish populations (KP5) was less clear. Data on Catch per Unit
Effort (derived from interviews with fishermen) were not consistently collected over the
course of the project, due to seasonal changes in gear, fish abundance, etc, making results
difficult to interpret. The data showed stability in catches in three districts, while two
districts – Sikka and Raja Ampat – showed significant increase, and one – Buton –
showed a decrease in yield. Data on visual census of reef fish abundance, collected along
transects of reefs at the same time as live coral cover was monitored, were highly variable
and were more a reflection of fish biodiversity than increases in abundance or biomass.
However, community members interviewed reported increased numbers of fish in the
No-Take Zones, as well as the return of rarer species which had not been seen in years in
some places.

Community welfare was enhanced, based on increases in household income and access to
better community based infrastructure for target beneficiaries. As shown in KPI 6, the
results of socio economic benefit monitoring and evaluation (SEBME) conducted by LIPI
in 2008 (baseline) and 2011 (impact) shows that the income of beneficiary group
members who received LKM funds improved by around 20% on average, in the seven
project districts.

In addition, as in KPI 7, in 2009 LIPI‘s coral reef information and training centre
(CRITC) conducted a baseline survey to determine if beneficiaries in coastal
communities perceived that the project has had a positive impact on their welfare
surveying more than 1,500 respondents from 25 village, 7 districts, both direct and non
beneficiaries at the target villages. The value was 70%. In 2011 this study was repeated
which showed that over 80% of respondents felt that the project was of benefit to them.
This KPI has been surpassed as the objective has been met in all the districts except
Pangkep. The reasons given for this were related to the difficulty of reaching some of the
most remote islands in the Pangkep District.

3.3 Efficiency:

The project was more cost effective than anticipated at appraisal, as shown by the higher
rates of return in the economic, financial, and fiscal analysis presented in Annex 3. It
should be noted that the analysis was based primarily on the efficiency of Alternative
Income Generating Activities, financed through revolving microcredit funds.

The economic analysis re-estimated the Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) at the
district level, which was on average 21 percent compared to 16 percent in the PAD.
However, the EIRRs varied considerably– from 5 percent in Biak to 41 percent in
Wakatobi – due to differences in the quality of coral reefs and their associated benefits.


                                                     16
These differences were driven by the relative size of the managed coral reef area, the
district‘s effectiveness at curbing illegal fishing practices, and its exposure to adverse
external factors, such as cyclone damage and coral bleaching.

The financial analysis showed that most alternative income generation activities (AIGs)
provided supplemental income rather than an opportunity to exit the fisheries sector
altogether, as the size of the funds was too small ($5,000 per community) relative to the
target population, and repayment rates averaged only 60% across Districts. Yet for a few
AIGs, such as seaweed culture, the Financial Internal Rates of Return (FIRRs) were up to
three times the appraisal estimates. These high FIRRs enabled fishermen in some
communities to shift from capture fishing as the major source of income to more
profitable but also more risky seaweed culture activities. Additional training in farming
techniques and access to good quality cultivars could help improve survival rates in the
future and reduce volatility in yields.

Lastly, the fiscal impact of effective and collaborative management of coral reef areas
was also re-estimated. Owing to higher fish prices and larger managed coral reef areas,
the direct fiscal impact exceeded the appraisal estimate for almost all districts. In addition,
the estimates suggest a potential doubling of expected fiscal revenues from tourism, if
developed, due to the higher quality of coral reefs.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The project achieved the objectives of the combined PDO/GEO with moderate
shortcomings in the level of achievement, efficiency, and relevance. It did so despite the
challenges of building decentralized capacity and management, and developing and
disseminating new concepts around collaborative coral reef management and community
empowerment in 358 remote and widely dispersed coastal communities [see map].

All seven KPIs met or exceeded their targets, though there were some limitations in the
underlying design or methodologies in target setting, as discussed elsewhere in the ICR,
particularly in the case of KPI 5 (fish populations). Project benefits were extended
directly to around 12,500 households (project estimate) through village grants and seed
funds. Additional benefits from setting up community-owned No-Take Zones are
beginning to emerge as fish biomass and marine biodiversity within these Marine
Protected Areas are increasing and signs of spillover of fish into adjacent fishing grounds
are being observed, suggesting that reef fish stocks in some areas are rebuilding. Positive
trends in live coral cover over six out of seven Districts also has implications for
maintaining tourism potential and other ecosystem services of healthy coral reefs. Thus,
benefits are likely to have extended to all 358 villages (approximately 320,000
beneficiaries) through coral reef collaborative management. The average of economic
internal rate of return (EIRRs) at the seven target districts is estimated 20% compared to
16% at appraisal.




                                              17
Although the project initially experienced substantial delays in implementation,
ultimately the steps taken to resolve the underlying problems, combined with the
restructuring and extension, allowed the project to be completed without significantly
limiting or compromising its efficiency or achievement of outputs or outcomes.

The project completed almost all planned activities, or even surpassed many of the targets
covering seven districts. The impacts of the project are seen in areas outside of the project
areas. There are several villages outside of project areas that have already started copying
the COREMAP CBM models, including LPSTKs, Perdas, Pokmas, MCS and DPLs
without the project inputs. Information dissemination also brought about very positive
impacts not only among the project communities, but also outside of project districts. The
adoption of the COREMAP-II education curriculum and textbooks by the MoE, project
officials‘ constant appearances in mass media and the commitment shown by the
president of Indonesia to support the CTI - all of these demonstrate how COREMAP-II
has been proactive in disseminating the project concept to the whole nation and
successful in communicating with the public. Although the project achieved most of its
objectives and is viewed quite positively by both the Borrower and the Bank, the overall
outcome is rated Moderately Satisfactory rather than Satisfactory mainly because of the
conceptual and practical limitations identified in some indicators intended to demonstrate
project outcomes, as well as concern over sustainability of the AIGs.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
 (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Poverty Impacts
3.5.1 As mentioned above in KPI 6, the project was successful in increasing incomes
among the direct LKM fund beneficiaries. The SEBME also found that the average
incomes of the beneficiaries were higher (IDR 525,000) than non-beneficiaries (IDR
423,000). In addition, the SEBME also found that household income was also higher in
fisheries households (IDR 528,000) than non-fishery households (IDR 229,000). The
increase in Household income in each District was adjusted for inflation and HH income
among direct Project beneficiaries was significantly above the mean household income
for the District as a whole (i.e., not all communities in a District participated in the
Project.

Gender Aspect
3.5.2 The project recruited two VM per village and at least one of the VM was always a
woman. In terms of benefitting women, the average percentage of women LKM fund
borrowers was more than 50% based on the available data from three districts - Buton:
70%; Wakatobi: 62%; and Raja Ampat: 40%.

3.5.3 The project also established a production group and a women‘s group in each
village. The project provided fish processing equipment for the production groups to
make boiled fish paste or fish cakes for sale. These activities were mainly carried out by
women. However, the role of women‗s groups appeared not well defined and often
merged with the production groups



                                             18
Social Development
3.5.4 The project carried out social marketing of sustainable coral reef management in
all 358 villages. It conducted participatory rural appraisal (PRA) and formed 358
LPSTKs. With four Pokmas groups (production, gender, conservation, and MCS), the
LPSTKs played a fundamental role in establishing DPLs, developing RPTK, identifying
and implementing sub-projects including VICs and village infrastructure. The processes
to involve the community as a whole have improved the level of community ownership
and responsibility for the sustainable management of their coral reef and marine based
resources. In addition, COREMAP-II‘s comprehensive approach to outreach (through
multi-media, formal and informal education was highly successful, which led to
substantial changes in people‘s appreciation of coral reefs and sustainable use of the
resources.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
The institutional strengthening was substantial, especially at the district and village levels.
COREMAP-II was nationally coordinated but decentralized in implementation. The
COREMAP-II approach to build community based institutions for coral reef CBM was
new to the project districts and villages; the establishment and operationalization of
LPSTK and four functional Pokmas at each of all 358 villages was unprecedented. The
creation and maintenance of DPLs at the majority of COREMAP-II communities
especially require behavioral changes and enforcement of agreed rules among fishers. In
addition, the construction of VICs and successful implementation of sub-projects also
proves the capacity of LPSTK and Pokmas to manage community based small-scale
projects and community procurement.

In COREMAP-II, unlike COREMAP-I, all project expenditure followed the national fund
disbursement system. This required capacity as well as responsibility of planning, fund
and project management at the district levels. As a result, each district is now capable of
planning and executing complex projects such as COREMAP-II. The responsibility borne
by the government staff at all levels to implement the complex project and meet the needs
of their communities did contribute to increased sustainability and ownership of the
project among implementers – when there were problems in fund disbursement, for
example, it was the government who took the leadership to solve the issues through
negotiations and issuing decrees and administrative ordinances. As shown during the last
three years‘ project performance, once major implementation obstacles were addressed,
the system began to function smoothly and executing units were able to catch up from the
initial delay and achieve their output targets.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The impacts are already seen in several non- COREMAP-II communities. In total, 6
villages and 2 districts have started copying the COREMAP-II CBM approach without
COREMAP-II support. In addition, the adoption of the COREMAP-II educational
material by the MoE as their formal curriculum on coral reefs was an unintended positive
outcome. The ADB also adopted the educations materials produced by the Project for use
in their sites in Western Indonesia.



                                             19
COREMAP-II‘s public awareness and education program was highly successful. Directly
and indirectly, the general public‘s awareness of the need for coral reef conservation has
increased as a result of COREMAP-II‘s award-winning multi-media campaign.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome and Global Environment
Outcome
Rating: Substantial

The two main sustainability risks identified in the PAD are: (i) maintenance of
community institutions created by the project; (ii) lack of substantial AIG activities
among COREMAP communities to sustain community support.

Maintenance of community institutions will require additional support from the
government, ideally the district governments. Although the target communities are aware
of benefits to conserve coral reefs for increasing fish population, which would
subsequently increase fishers‘ incomes, there is a need to reinforce conservation efforts
through benefits that would flow to communities over the near term. District
governments have committed to supporting community-based co-management through
sustaining many of the costs for extension and outreach to communities in maintaining
their DPLs, including ramped up monitoring, control and surveillance. This will be
stepped up under COREMAP III through institutional strengthening to village (LPSTK)
and District level governance units, active dissemination of best practices in sustainable
fisheries management and the piloting of rights-based and other incentive systems for
community stewardship of coastal resources. Enforcement of zoning and other
regulations governing resource use in Marine Conservation Areas (KKLD) will also help
control illegal fishing practices beyond the control of local communities.

The alternative income generation (AIG) subcomponent was a weakness of the project.
The LKM (revolving fund) was established in all 358 villages and remained operational
even after the project ended. The original design was intended to create AIGs through
providing micro-credits to beneficiaries in the form of revolving funds. However, this
expectation was unrealistic as the amount given to each village represented only Rp 50
million or about US$ 5,500 over a period of five years. The LKMs provided over 20
types of AIGs. As of the end of 2010, around 1,450 AIGs received funds from the project,
of which about 880 were non-fisheries/non-aquaculture, while the rest, 570, were related
to fisheries/ aquaculture. These non-fisheries/non-aquaculture activities include (i) kiosk;
(ii) small-item trading; (iii) small-scale cottage industries for local markets. However,
these alternative income generating schemes provided supplemental income for the most
part, rather than sustaining alternative livelihoods through alternative forms of income
generation. Only seaweed farming (and in some cases grouper culture), with additional
inputs from outside the project proved profitable enough to cause some fishers to switch
to aquaculture. The lack of profitable alternatives puts fishers at risk of returning to old
habits dominated by unsustainable capture fishing, rather than developing alternative
means of using marine ecosystem goods and services sustainably.


                                             20
This risk will be mitigated under C3, with the introduction of a substantially scaled up
Alternative Livelihoods component, based on promising eco-business opportunities that
depend on healthy and productive coral reef and mangrove ecosystems. The guiding
principle for such nature-based AIGs will be the delivery of benefit streams to
communities through the capture of resource rents from healthy, well managed coral reef
ecosystems, thus sustaining eco-system services and building community wealth and
welfare.

An additional risk to the sustainability of outcomes not present at the time of the PAD,
are the Government‘s competing priorities for significantly increasing fisheries
production, announced in 2010. The ambitious targets for increasing the contribution of
fisheries production to GDP over the short term, could jeopardize the longer term and
less directly measurable economic benefits of sustainable management of fisheries
resources. COREMAP III can play a significant role in helping to develop a more
sustainable fisheries production strategy where the emphasis is on maximizing economic
benefits from the fisheries sector rather than focusing on production targets that
emphasize biomass and volume of yields. The latter will accelerate the decline and
ultimate depletion of stocks already fully exploited or lead to negative environmental
externalities from aquaculture which exceeds local carrying capacity.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The project design was very ambitious, although it was considered necessary for a
sustainable coral reef management and livelihoods effort integrated through three layers
of government. The project development objectives were closely aligned with both
Government and Bank strategies on protected areas and decentralized natural resource
management. However, shortcomings in the identification of risks related to complexity
of the project and the implementing environment led to substantial delays in getting the
project off the ground.

The project design benefitted from an extensive preparation period which drew lessons
from Phase 1 and other projects in the Bank‘s portfolio. Nevertheless, stemming in part
from its complex scope, the project exhibited some weaknesses at entry in four areas.
First, the project encountered a two-year delay at entry due to the inability by the Bank
and the Government to come to an agreement on the conditions of the loan. Second, even
upon agreement of the terms of the loan, design issues led to KPIs that poorly reflected
the objectives and potential achievements of the project. Third, the complexity of the
GoI‘s administrative and financial system at both the central and district levels was
underestimated, leading to delays in project implementation. Fourth, there was an
unrealistically high expectation about the impact of AIGs on the economic and social
welfare of communities.


                                           21
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank‘s supervision and missions were generally proactive, providing technical
assistance and advice. This was particularly true following restructuring of the project.
The mid-term review was extensive and provided a sound basis for project restructuring.
Most importantly, the restructuring and other steps taken at a critical juncture in
implementation were instrumental in turning around a project that was at risk of closing
in problem status. The Bank established a complete team presence in Indonesia to
maintain a close communication between the GoI, NCU and the Bank. Each supervision
mission was conducted by the task team leader (TTL) and/or co-TTL based in Indonesia
with support from the procurement, financial, safeguard, anti-corruption action plan,
community/micro finance specialists in country. Although the project had three different
Task Team Leaders over the course of implementation, which did affect team continuity
and efficiency at times, the transition in leadership was also used as an opportunity to
reassess the direction of the project and the need for mid-course corrections. The
presence of a dedicated Bank management team had direct effects on the quality of
supervision and led to improvements in project implementation post-restructuring. Some
additional examples of support that the Bank provided to the project include:

      Review of the Project Management Manual, the Project Technical Guidance, the
       Financial management Manual, Procurement Plans, and Procurement Manual;
      Independent review and analysis of ecological and socio-economic data to
       determine statistical significance of trends and the extent to which results could be
       attributed to the Project
      Improvement of the MIS to support the M&E function and to address the
       weakness in data retrieval and reporting identified in supervision missions;
      Links with the international coral reef research community to strengthen
       collaboration and capacity in science-based management of coral reefs
      Provision of training for the NCU team on procurement and safeguards;
      Reviews of procurement plans and procedures to address issues;
      Advice on technical aspects of the project to improve implementation quality; and
      Direct implementation of ACAP for the NCU.

Although initial ISRs did not reflect the impact of lengthy initial implementation delays
and their underlying causes early enough, Bank management was, nevertheless, aware of
these issues and was actively seeking solutions. Two full supervision missions per year
were held regularly from the start of restructuring until the project ended. Comprehensive
Aide Memoires were prepared and fully vetted with government to document project
status, flag issues and agree on time-bound action plans. The last ISR was archived nearly
a year before closing, and while it accurately reflected the project status at that time (MS),
substantial improvements in performance were achieved over the course of the year prior
to closing, with many aspects rated Satisfactory. This was the result of substantial
improvements in coordination between the GOI and the WB Project Teams. Although
these gains were reflected in the final Aide Memoire, an additional ISR should have been


                                             22
archived before the project ended to capture these improvements and the stronger
achievement of objectives described in the ICR (even though the overall outcomes were
still considered to be in the MS range).

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.4 As noted above, the Bank task team regularly conducted supervisory field
missions and accessed additional Bank resources to increase the level of supervision after
restructuring to move the project out of problem status. The borrower felt that Bank‘s
technical inputs added significant value and helped improve the quality of project
implementation. Although the Bank‘s procurement procedures were considered
unnecessarily cumbersome by the GOI in comparison with those used for ADB financed
activities in Western Indonesia, the Bank Team worked with the GOI to resolve these
bottlenecks and provided strong support to the government in achieving the PDO.
Perhaps most importantly, the Bank helped the GOI establish a successful model for
decentralized co-management of coral reef resources involving local government and
coastal communities that will be institutionalized in the final phase of COREMAP.

The Bank‘s overall performance is rated MS on the basis of MU performance at entry,
MS performance in supervision, and the MS rating for overall project outcomes.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The government had a strong commitment to support the project throughout preparation,
implementation, and even after closing. The Government‘s willingness to borrow
substantial amounts on IBRD terms over the course of a three-phase APL speaks to this
high level of commitment. Coral reef conservation and sustainable development of
marine resources have been declared priorities of the central government for many years;
new commitments have been made in line with International Declarations and Plans of
Action to conserve marine biodiversity to gazette 20 million hectares of coral reefs under
Marine Conservation Areas. In addition, the GoI‘s proactive role in the CTI has been
strongly supported by the president of Indonesia. Linking support for COREMAP with
achieving objectives under the National CTI Plan of Action is strategic and fully
endorsed by the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF).

Government support for COREMAP notwithstanding, the Project encountered early
delays related to the Central Government‘s national budgeting process, the DIPA. This
highly bureaucratic process posed a challenge to timely disbursement and implementation
of Phase II. The Project also faced delays in implementation of social funds due to
changing policy decisions on revolving funds. As noted above, however, these
implementation issues were eventually overcome and the GOI remains committed to
COREMAP, with plans to invest in a third phase.




                                            23
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

At the National Level, the Project was implemented by MMAF, with support from two
other implementing partners: LIPI and PHKA. Implementation was further supported by
strong coordination at the regional level with the five provinces and seven districts
involved, who provided legal and policy support, personnel, budgetary and in-kind
resources. MMAF was responsible for coordinating overall implementation from the
national level, through the provincial level down to the district level, and ultimately to the
Community level with the deployment of Village Motivators and Senior Extension and
Technical Officers. A National Coordination Unit was set up within the Ministry of
Marine Affairs and Fisheries to facilitate and oversee this decentralized management
structure, and to bring in needed technical expertise from LIPI and PHKA in capacity
building and project monitoring and evaluation. Of the three executing agencies at the
national level, MMAF and LIPI (which had been the implementing agency for
COREMAP Phase 1) succeeded in overcoming early implementation delays due to
budget (DIPA) and disbursement issues, although data collection for certain indicators
remained a problem, limiting interpretation of results. PHKA, responsible for capacity
building in Marine Park management, was less able to fulfill the activities assigned to it,
in large part due to budget coordination issues which prevented the timely allocation of
counterpart funds for the disbursement of GEF grant funds—and the implementation of
certain activities within the agreed time frame. This required reallocation of remaining
grant funds in the final year of the project to activities that were fully financed by the
GEF. Implementation of these activities by PHKA was successful, but disbursement
delays related to the DIPA, suggested a very real constraint on the agency's ability to co-
implement such projects in the future.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Implementation was delayed and the project required restructuring and a two year
extension. However, the borrower was successful in carrying out a highly complex but
comprehensive project, achieving the PDO, enhancing decentralization in implementation
and improving capacities of the COREMAP-II districts in meeting the needs of target
communities. The GoI‘s commitments to sustainable coral reef management now go
beyond COREMAP-II as shown in the GoI‘s leadership in creating the CTI. COREMAP
III is envisioned as Indonesia‘s principal contribution to the CTI going forward. Although
many aspects of the implementing and executing agencies‘ performance were less than
fully satisfactory, together they succeeded in implementing the project in a decentralized
and coordinated manner, achieving the PDO and reaching beneficiaries in remote islands
despite the complex and multilayered implementation challenges of the Project.

6. Lessons Learned

The lessons learned listed below should be considered for the COREMAP III design.

   -   Select KPIs that accurately reflect project objectives and are measurable,
       and monitoring and evaluation methods that allow for continuous feedback
       on project performance and discrimination of project effects (i.e., allow
       attribution of outomes to the project). Due to the lack of controls set up at the
       outset of the project and inconsistencies in data collection, the monitoring data on
       KPI 4 and 5, were of limited use in assessing the project‘s contribution to the
       changes observed. Live coral cover is a status indicator and only one of several
       indicators of coral health and is not typically a linear response to environmental
       factors. Assessment of changes in coral reef health would have been enhanced if
       a related ‗process indicator‘ (e.g., juvenile coral recruitment rate) was also
       measured, allowing a fuller and more accurate picture of likely future outcomes.
       CREEL can be a useful tool for examining livelihoods aspects of fishermen and
       engaging local fishermen in dialogue about fisheries and their own livelihoods.
       LIPI successfully carried out its role in providing training, technical manuals, and
       tools to collect CPUE data. However, the collection of data by local units was
       sporadic and the data inconsistent, and therefore could not be verified. Finally,
       monitoring controls need to be established in order to better evaluate project
       effectiveness.

   -   Supporting organizational structure and reinforcing institutional
       arrangements at all levels of government and strong ownership by local
       stakeholders are key to decentralized collaborative management. The project
       was able to instil a strong sense of ownership to local governments and other
       stakeholders, particularly local communities. This not only contributes to strong
       engagement during the period of the project but also beyond the project‘s life.

   -   COREMAP-II’s comprehensive approach using awareness, training,
       education, economic and social welfare, research and monitoring, and
       proactive management led to its success in accomplishing the objectives. If
       any one of these areas had been ignored, the project may not have had the degree
       of success in accomplishing a strong decentralized and community-based
       collaborative management, although it imposes a big challenge for all
       implementers.

   -   AIG activities must be accompanied with adequate technical and financial
       support. COREMAP-II livelihood support helped to increase supplemental
       incomes, but not for substantial AGIs. Any AGI activities have to incorporate
       technical assistance programs and well designed financial support systems.

   -   Project design must realistically incorporate logistical, financial, and
       capacity factors that may present challenges in the field. The project may
       have been quite ambitious in its design to: cover more than 457,222 ha of marine



                                            25
    areas in the remotest parts of Indonesia; 416 villages in its original design;
    institutionalize collaborative management practices in villages that have limited
    infrastructure and education capacity; operationalize routine communication and
    management activities where weather conditions and geographic isolation pose
    severe logistical problems; among others. Future efforts should be focused on: 1)
    raising awareness at the broadest level possible to reach as many villages as
    possible; but 2) developing a basic COREMAP model for extension to other
    coastal communities across districts in Indonesia that is easy to execute and
    scalable. Ideally, such a model would incorporate key institutional arrangements,
    financial incentives and community buy in to deliver desired environmental
    actions at district and community levels that are mutually reinforcing and
    sustainable.

-   Streamlining Government and Bank financial administrative and
    disbursement system is absolutely critical for project success/failure.
    Although this project succeeded in spite of the central government‘s rigid,
    complex, and cumbersome financial and administrative system, delays and
    disproportionate attention and effort by the project team toward administration led
    to frustration and mistrust by local stakeholders.

-   Awareness raising and education can be a low-risk, cost effective way to
    strengthen support and ownership of project objectives and improve
    outcomes. The realization by community members of the connection between
    coral reef health and human welfare is a revelatory event. The fact that the project
    was able to carry this forward in an exponential manner was a major success. The
    Sea Partnership component was also a strong success resulting in massive
    numbers of university studies and degrees focused on coral and marine science,
    leading to a cadre of knowledgeable scientists that can increase the capacity to
    sustainably manage and monitor Indonesia‘s seascape and its resources.

-   Revolving funds may not be the best mechanism to channel needed financing
    for livelihood transformation. Although intensive efforts to train and socialize
    community members in the concept of revolving loan funds, there was
    misunderstanding and misuse of the funds in some cases, and poor overall rate of
    repayment (60%). Globally, revolving funds have had limited success, and their
    sustainability is being revisited. Future efforts toward poverty alleviation through
    grant funds and credit must be designed in a way in which there is greater
    ownership and accountability by community members and adequate technical
    assistance to optimize use of these funds.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1. Institutional Strengthening
This component was aimed at enhancing government institutional responsiveness to meet
the needs of coastal communities and to support community-based coral reef
management. The subcomponents included: (1.1) program coordination, monitoring and
evaluation, and training; (1.2) Coral reef research and monitoring by the Coral Reef
Information and Training Center; and (1.3) Legal, policy, and strategy assistance.

The project was successful in strengthening the participating institutions at all levels. The
level of the achievement in this component was found to be substantial. The successful
implementation of this complex and comprehensive project proves high level of staff
capacity, which was built through project training and implementation. As a result, the
project was able to support sustainable coral reef management and to improve the welfare
of 358 coastal communities.

1.1. Program Coordination, M&E and Training
This subcomponent was aimed at establishing and sustaining institutional structures for
national program coordination and decentralized program management. This included
establishing appropriate bodies/units across different governmental levels (i.e., national,
provincial, district, village) through Decision Letters (SK), workshops, and training
sessions.

The NCU, the body responsible for the coordination and implementation of the project,
was established in 2005 and included key government bodies and other stakeholders
across sectors and levels (i.e., national, provincial, district, village). At the national level,
the key bodies included: (1) National Steering Committee; (2) National Technical
Committee; and (3) NCU. The NCU under the direction of MMAF‘s Directorate General
of Marine, Coasts and Small Islands (KP3K), Directorate of Marine and Aquatic
Resources Conservation (KKJI) was responsible for overall Project coordination,
supervision and implementation. Implementation by the NCU at the national level was
supported by two NPIUs: LIPI for scientific support, and PHKA for marine park support.

At the provincial level, implementation was undertaken by five Regional Coordination
Units (RCU) led by the provincial fisheries services (Province Dinas KP) located in
South Sulawesi, Southeast Sulawesi, Papua, West Papua, and Nusa Tenggara. At the
district level, implementation was led by seven PMUs under the district fisheries services
(District Dinas KP) located in Pangkep, Selayar, Buton, Wakatobi, Raja Ampat, Biak,
and Sikka. In each of the Project‘s 358 villages, project implementation was carried out
by a Coral Reef Management Committee (LPSTK) in coordination with Village Heads.

The Project‘s operational structure was conveyed through SK (Decision Letters) by
Ministers, Governors, District Heads, and Village Heads. Follow-up SKs detailing
assignment of personnel and duties were issued annually by the respective directors for
the NCU and NPIUs, Provincial Dinas KP Heads for RCUs and District Dinas KP Heads
for PMUs. All PMUs were established in a timely manner, adequately staffed and



                                               30
functioned well. They were able to properly execute their duties and fulfill assigned
responsibilities. PHKA was able to carry out project objectives, though restructuring
within PHKA and budget changes within a complex central government financial system
led to some delays.

A Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) Feedback Unit, established in 2007, was responsible
for implementation progress and other national level reports. The unit developed a
manual and monitoring tool, and trained RCUs and PMUs in its use, as well as a Village
Profile form and a Complaint Handling System. In 2010, a Management Information
System (MIS) was developed but it has yet to be fully operational.

1.2 Coral Reef Research and Monitoring - CRITC
This subcomponent was aimed at providing research, monitoring results and management
information to support collaborative coral reef management. This included: monitoring
training; baseline surveys and monitoring; and dissemination of educational and
monitoring results material.

Coral reef research and monitoring was led by the Coral Reef Information and Training
Center (CRITC-LIPI). CRITC-LIPI had three related functions: (a) monitor coral cover at
select permanent plots as well as the selected communities for socio-economic impact
analysis; (b) provide training to CRITC-PMUs and community members in reef health
(PIT) and fisheries (CREEL) monitoring techniques; and (c) disseminate the results of
monitoring efforts through annual workshops and its website. LIPI began collecting
baseline information on coral cover in 2006 at their permanent plots and later at DPLs.
LIPI monitored reef health at permanent transects, while the CRITC-PMUs collected
monitoring data at DPLs. Educational and training material included: monitoring
guidelines; marine atlases; mangrove-related material; tsunami preparedness guidelines;
local education materials for grades 1-12; and teacher training manuals.

Overall, monitoring data showed positive trends and seemed to generally meet output
indicators. There was positive coral cover growth in six of the seven districts through
LIPI monitoring and four of the seven districts through PMU monitoring. However,
there were significant differences between LIPI and PMU monitoring results due to
differences in monitoring regimes.

Reef fish populations through LIPI visual census method showed an increase in two of
the seven districts. Visual census was not used at DPLs. Visual census method did show
an overall increase of reef fish population of 3%. Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) surveys
of reef fish harvested by traditional gear were carried out in adjacent fishing grounds
using the fish catch survey (CREEL) method in 75 villages in 2008-09. The data showed
stability of catches in three districts, while two districts (Sikka, Raja Ampat) showed
significant increase, and one (Buton) showed a yield decrease. However, the CREEL data
collection was inconsistent and effectively could not be used to evaluate whether project
intervention played a role in fish yield increase/decrease.




                                            31
The project chose to monitor reef health by examining live coral cover and use growth in
live coral cover, and growth of fish population as indicators of project effectiveness.
Concerns in using these indicators are as follows. Using coral growth rates as an indicator
of coral reef health may not be appropriate in sites where coral reefs are in mature states
or are subject to eutrophication and sedimentation. Expecting wide-scale coral growth
from project activities may be unrealistic. Live coral cover and fish population growth
may not necessarily reflect improvements through project efforts, although project efforts
may have contributed to greater coral health. Inconsistent (i.e., CPUE) and infrequent
(i.e., coral reef monitoring) monitoring regimes presented sample problems. Lack of
control plots to compare sample plot results meant that comparison between project
trends and trends in other sites could not be made, thus potentially underestimating the
positive trends in live coral cover if coral cover in non COREMAP reefs declined
significantly during the same period. Finally, while visual censuses are useful for
biodiversity data they are less useful for population trends.

The monitoring training component was generally carried out well. Overall, a large
number of community members were trained – 192 and 101 people in CREEL and PIT
methods, respectively. However, the transition from training to actual use in the field
needed more time and stronger coordination. The data collected by community members
were inconsistent, not done in a timely manner, and questionable in quality. As a result,
LIPI had to discard data from some villages. This said, however, engaging community
members in training and actually having them collect data was a major achievement.

In addition to monitoring coral reef data, LIPI collected socio-economic data to better
gauge project interventions on enhanced community welfare of coastal communities in
target districts. Baseline surveys were carried out in 2006, and subsequent surveys were
carried out in 2008 and 2011 in a total of 1,605 households across seven districts.
Household income of project beneficiary groups increased by 34% across the seven
districts, and in Raja Ampat there was an 80% increase. Furthermore, data showed that
household income increase was greater in project target villages as compared to other
villages within target districts. Household income (adjusting for inflation) improved by
21% in beneficiary groups. A large majority (85%) of community members in target
villages, as evidenced by these survey results, felt that the project had positive impacts on
their welfare.

1.3. Legal, Policy and Strategy Assistance
This subcomponent was aimed at legalizing program structures, formalize community
authority to collaborative manage coral reef and associated ecosystems and support the
development of key national strategies. This included: organizing program structures
across different government levels through SKs; developing and implementing strategic
plans and laws; and socializing COREMAP-II through workshops and training sessions.

Structurally, management units were formed at all levels including national, provincial,
district, and village. A National Strategy for Sustainable Coral Reef Fish Management
was produced. Provincial PMUs were established and functioned well. Each district
established a Coastal Community Empowerment Board (CCEB) and enacted a District



                                             32
Marine Resources Strategic Plan (Renstra). All 358 target villages formed a Coral Reef
Management Committee (LPSTK) that contained community support groups with
specific functions/issues (e.g., production, gender, conservation, and Micro Finance Unit
(LKM)). The RPTKs were drafted and endorsed through Village Head authority
(Perdes).

2.   Community Based and Collaborative Management

This component was aimed at empowering coastal communities and institutions in
project target districts to sustainably manage coral reefs and associated ecosystems to
increase community welfare and incomes. The subcomponents included: (2.1)
community empowerment; (2.2) community-based coral reef management; (2.3)
community development; (2.4) district marine conservation management; and (2.5)
marine park support. Activities included: Participatory Rural Appraisals (PRA); Coral
Reef Management Plans (RPTK) including village-level No Take Zones (DPL); district-
level Marine Protected Areas (KKLD); a Monitoring, Control and Surveillance (MCS)
program.

As a result of decentralization, community-based and collaborative management (CBM)
has perhaps been the most important change in protected areas and natural resource
management in Indonesia for the past decade. The role of communities and local
government has been strengthened, while the role of the central government has shifted
more toward coordination. The approach is to engage local communities and other
stakeholders (e.g., local government, civil society, private sector) to be integrally
involved in the planning and execution of protected areas and natural resource
management.

Within the context of Indonesia and its history, political changes, project coverage area,
logistical difficulties (e.g., lack of infrastructure, equipment, high cost of fuel), very low
level of education and awareness in many of the districts, this component was the most
difficult and ambitious. As a result, this component was project‘s most complex, costly
and time-consuming element. Despite these highly difficult conditions, results from this
component were successful. However, it is important to note that a key assumption that
revolving funds (LKM) would lead to alternative incomes, reduction of destructive
practices and poverty reduction was unrealistic given the level of intervention in both
financial and technical inputs. Although income trends in target districts were positive,
attributing this increase to the LKMs may be unwarranted. It appeared that increase or
decrease in income may have been due to factors unrelated to project interventions (e.g.,
decrease of income in Buton due to decline of economically important small fish
resources base ikan teri). Furthermore, it appears that the amount of LKM funds were too
small for the size of the target population. As a result, the funds were mainly used for
supplemental income generation activities such as small scale trading, kiosks, and buying
additional equipment for traditionally existing economic activities.




                                             33
2.1 Community Empowerment

This subcomponent was aimed at organizing and empowering communities to undertake
collaborative management of coral reefs and associated ecossystems. This included:
training key personnel at the district and community levels; conducting PRAs and sketch
maps to better understand village and resource use profiles; conducting awareness and
socialization campaigns; establishing Village Information Centers (VIC); and providing
communication equipment and establishing a communication network.

This was achieved successfully. COREMAP-II‘s decentralized and step-wise approach of
empowering communities led to successful CBM at the target districts. Field teams
including Senior Extension and Training Officers (SETO), Community Facilitators (CF),
and Village Motivators (VM) were recruited and trained at district-level workshops.
Overall, the project employed 662 field staff (i.e., 48 SETOs, 147 CFs, 468 VMs) which
was below the PAD‘s envisaged target of 1,090 field team members but these numbers
were appropriate for the geographic and jurisdictional conditions. ‗Self Learning Packs‘
in CD and book formats were used as a key training tool for SETO‘s, CFs, VMs, RCUs,
and PMUs.

As a first step, PRAs and sketch maps to gather baseline information about communities,
coral reefs and local fisheries were conducted. Next, each village formed an LPSTK with
subsections for production, gender, MCS and) LKM. An extensive awareness and
socialization campaign was conducted in all target villages and districts. Awareness
efforts used meetings, television, radio, and print media to promote awareness and
behavioral changes related to coral reefs and fisheries practices. VICs were established to
serve as a place for community training, education, after-school activities, and
discussions. A communication network was established in about 90% of target
communities. FM radio stations were established in Pangkep, Wakatobi and Selayar,
while the other districts had collaborative program with existing radio stations. FM/AM
radio access was available in virtually all villages. For daily outgoing communications,
either cell phones (available in 65% of all COREMAP-II coastal villages) or walkie-
talkies (available in 85% of all COREMAP-II villages).

Based on a survey carried out in 2010, an average of 75% of the respondents in target
districts and 86% of in target villages felt that healthy coral reefs were key to their lives,
respectively. Responses by local government staff and community members in the ICR
field interviews were overwhelmingly positive toward the awareness component of the
project.

2.2 Community Based Coral Reef Management

This sub-component was aimed at supporting communities to formulate and implement
collaborative management of coral reef and associated ecosystems. This included:
awareness campaigns; RPTKs including a village-level No Take Zones (DPL);
Monitoring, MCS program; and a socialization program for CBM.




                                              34
The project succeeded in increasing the level of awareness concerning coastal and
marine-related natural resource management and setting in motion community-based
actions to strengthen community-based coral reef management. Extensive awareness
campaigns and PRAs led to village-level Coral Reef Management Plans (RPTK). At the
end of the project, all 358 villages produced RPTKs which required them to establish a
village-level No Take Zone (DPL). COREMAP-II villages produced a total of 317 DPLs
totaling 15,794.8 ha. Implementation of RPTKs also included: a MCS program;
installation of DPL marker buoys; dissemination of DPL coordinates to communities;
posting of schematic maps at VICs; and socialization of plans through community
meetings, public announcements, and media coverage.

MCS, designed to better monitor and deter illegal fisheries activities, deserves a special
mention as improved surveillance and interdiction in COREMAP supported sites was one
of the most successful parts of the project. MCS helped to reduce illegal/destructive
fishing practices by about 60% from 2,200 infringements in 2005 to 880 infringements in
2010. Furthermore, follow-up legal activities led to 70% successful prosecution. Some of
the key success factors responsible for this result include: (a) strong support by the
Village MCS Unit [Pokmaswas]; (b) availability of MCS radio communication systems;
(c) a patrolling system by law enforcement officers; and d) increased public awareness.
The PAD envisaged pilot decommissioning of destructive fishing gears in selected
villages. However, this was not found to be necessary as District Dinas KP already had
programs in place to halt the use of compressor diving, bombing and poisoning activities.

2.3 Community Development

This subcomponent was aimed at increasing and diversifying coastal communities‘
incomes through transparent, accountable and financially viable livelihood opportunities
with greater access to capital. This support came in the form of: (a) training in financial
management for LPSTKs and LKM; (b) provision of seed funds through LKM; (c)
village social infrastructure grants; (d) district block grants; and (e) AIG financial and
technical support.

A need to obtain a Ministry of Finance (MoF) for LKM led to a +/- two-year delay. Upon
approval from MoF and training (e.g., bookkeeping, financial reporting), all 358 villages
engaged in LKM activities including: seaweed and fish cage culture; fish capture; baking
goods; and other small business operations. Each village received about US$ 5,500 over a
period of five years. As of the end of 2010, around 61% of the loans of the 1,450 loans
were for non-fisheries/aquacultural activities. About half of the borrowers were women,
exceeding the project target of 30% women involvement. It was felt that these funds were
not adequate in building a strong alternative income generation (AIG) base. Globally,
revolving funds have had mixed results because they require extensive training and
socialization, and enabling community conditions to make these funds sustainable.

Villages also received village social infrastructure grants, which were an integral part of
the RPTKs and were decided through community meetings. These grants (approximately




                                            35
US$ 1,100) typically supported the purchase/installation of public toilets, freshwater
wells, small surveillance boats, village gates, walkways, and boundary markers.

District Block Grants, designed to support AIG activities of a larger scale at the district
level, did not achieve its aim. Only about half of the funds allocated was used.
Difficulties in implementation stemmed from: (a) low level of understanding of the
concept; (b) MoF restrictions; (c) difficulty in deciding on appropriate projects; and (d)
low technical capacity at the district level. These difficulties applied to other concepts
that were introduced in the PAD but, in the end, were not implemented: (a) credit
guarantee scheme; and (b) employment outside the village. The project did undertake a
pilot project in two districts for management and certification of aquarium fish. However,
these were relatively unsuccessful due to lack of buyer support.

2.4 District Marine Conservation Management

This subcomponent was aimed at strengthening and supporting Marine Conservation
Areas (MCA) through collaborative management of coral reef and associated ecosystems
in participating districts. This included: forming CCEBs; PMUs; developing Renstra‘s;
and legalizing MCAs at the district level.

CCEBs and PMUs were established in a timely manner by District Heads (Bupati)
through formal Decision Letters (SK Bupati). CCEBs played an effective role in
promoting greater awareness and coordination among stakeholders such fishers, police,
navy, women‘s groups and NGOs. The PMUs, as set out in the SK Bupati, were quickly
established and generally functioned well, and were able to effectively undertake project
activities. In some cases, where counterpart funds from local budgets (APBD) were
needed, delays in the beginning of the project did occur due to the late arrival of APBD
funds. The PMUs also benefited in later years as the local governments became more
adept in early release of APBD resources.

Each District Dinas KP produced a Renstra. These Renstra‘s, used to enable legislation,
and provided coverage of +/- 300 DPLs and 12 district-level MCAs. Although
considerable work still remains to make district-level MCAs truly effective, their
development under the project has been effective in gaining greater representation of
marine and coastal ecosystems in target districts and forming a MCA network.

2.5 Marine Park Support

This subcomponent was aimed at strengthening the authority of participating marine
park/protected area to effectively engage in collaborative management. The project
supported PHKA in general for its role of marine protected area management and in
specific to promote collaborative management for training, workshops, conference
attendance, buildings, equipment, and operational support including socialization of local
communities. Management authority by PHKA originally included six areas (Taka Bone
Rate, Wakatobi, Raja Ampat, Kepulauan Padaido, Teluk Maumere, and Kepulauan




                                            36
Kapoposang) but management of all but Taka Bone Rate and Wakatobi national parks
were transferred to KKP in 2009.

In general, the marine park support subcomponent was achieved. PHKA was able to
conduct MPA training at the central and regional offices, and form National Park
Collaborative Forums. These contributed to participatory park zoning, their involvement
in CCEBs, collaborative management workshops with communities, socialization of park
programs, and production of awareness material. From 2009 to 2011, overall MPA
Scorecards showed a 20% gain indicating a significant improvement in COREMAP-II
area park management. All sites, except Kepulauan Kapoposang, showed improvement.
Biak, in particular, showed an exceptional gain of 115%.

This said, however, PHKA‘s-Ministry of Forestry (MoFor) complex financial and
administrative system, leading to delays and low financial and human resource capacity
in the field, represented significant challenges. Slow transfer of funds from MoF to
PHKA and PHKA institutional re-structuring in 2009 led to significant delays. Ultimately,
PHKA was not able to absorb the allocated grants. Lack of counterpart funds and low
funds for non-national park areas were a serious problem.

3. Public Awareness, Education and Sea Partnership

This component was aimed at promoting societal awareness of the benefits of coral reef
conservation and sustainable use that leads to behavior change. The subcomponents
included: (3.1) public awareness campaigns; (3.2) education program; (3.3) Sea
Partnership Program; (3.4) program support communications. This component was
highly satisfactory in its performance.

3.1 Public Awareness Campaigns

This subcomponent was aimed at supporting behavioral change for sustainable coral reef
collaborative management through public awareness (PA) materials, campaign and
advocacy. This included: VICs; media campaigns (e.g., TV, radio, print); CD; events;
exhibits; and joint programs with the private sector.

Although public awareness campaigns are not new to Indonesia, the scale at which the
project carried out public awareness deserves special mention. COREMAP-II‘s public
awareness used television, radio, and print media to promote awareness and behavioral
changes related to coral reefs and fisheries practices. This awareness campaign included
12 television features, 16 radio programs that aired 2,700 times over three years,
appearances by the project staff in 50 television and radio talk shows, and 50,000 print
media products. PA provided technical support and materials for numerous events/
exhibitions both within and outside the project. Importantly, as part of its advocacy
program, PA helped to initiate Forjubi (Forum Jurnalis Bahari Indonesia) to serve as a
support group of television and radio journalists. In addition, all seven districts either had
its own radio station or went into partnership with existing radio stations to broadcast
COREMAP-II messages. All participating villages established VICs as the center to



                                              37
display all material for public awareness. In addition, the Education Program and the Sea
Partnership contributed to improved community awareness. Based on a survey in target
districts in 2010, an average of 75% of the target district respondents and 86% of the
target village respondents, respectively, felt that healthy coral reefs were key to their lives.
Responses by local government staff and community members in the ICR field
interviews were overwhelmingly positive toward the awareness component of the project.

3.2 Education Program

This subcomponent was aimed at mainstreaming coral reef conservation and sustainable
use concepts into participating districts‘ educational systems. This included: developing
educational material; increasing capacity of educational institutions; and stimulating
support by the Ministry of National Education (DikNas) and district level educational
institutions.

Results far exceeded the Output Indicators. It was estimated that approximately 130,000
students attended coral reef education classes (95,000 – primary; 20,000 – middle; 15,000
– high). The project developed, produced and distributed local coral reef and marine
education materials (mulok) for elementary, junior and senior schools. These materials
were officially accepted by DikNas‘ Curriculum Center and therefore can be used for all
Indonesian schools. The PAD expected to only reach elementary schools, but the project
exceeded this target by including middle and high schools. A total of 32,700 books were
produced and distributed (17,360 – primary; middle – 10,095; high – 5,345). In 2011
electronic book versions were included on the DikNas website for downloads. To raise
institutional capacity, 1,225 teachers were directly trained (645 – primary; 327 – middle;
253 – high) and a Training of Trainer approach trained an estimated additional 4,400
local teachers. In total about 90% of all COREMAP-II districts coastal schools received
teacher training and materials. COREMAP-II also developed and distributed additional
documents such as teachers‘ manuals, syllabuses and other supporting materials. Non-
formal education was supported through national reef education events, media
promotions and assistance and scientific consultation for students.

3.3. Sea Partnership Program

This subcomponent was aimed at piloting a system to provide technically qualified
human resources to program districts to support collaborative management. This
included: supporting the developing of the Sea Partnership Program (SPP); providing
national and international advisory services and technical support; scholarships for
university and secondary school students; and internships for government staff and
university faculty.

The project was able to utilize KKP‘s existing SPP to increase Indonesia‘s technically
qualified human resource base. The initial support to build the SPP was critically
important, allowing the SPP to organize and build programs. Perhaps the most important
impact of the SPP was the large number of scholarships awarded to students (over 1,500
students of which 600 were bachelors/masters/Ph.D., and 900 high school) which can



                                              38
help build a cadre of Indonesian scientists that can better study and manage Indonesia‘s
seascape and its resources. Furthermore, approximately 666 students distributed coral
reef management information in coastal villages reaching an estimated 8,000 people.
With SPP support, districts were able to strengthen their fisheries departments through
the use of 84-seconded experts from universities.

3.4 Program Support Communication

This subcomponent was aimed at effectively communicating the project‘s philosophy,
objectives, activities, outputs and outcomes to program staff, partners, and key
stakeholders. This included: communication protocols; staff media training; project
information sheets, newsletters, information kits and press releases; public relations
campaign; events; and media awareness workshops and conferences.

   To achieve this it developed communication protocols, trained Project staff how to
   interact with the media, produced Project info sheets, newsletters and bulletins, made
   information kits and press releases on sensitive issues and ran a public relations
   campaign. The physical production, dissemination of material, and communication
   of key messages were carried out without difficulty. Although training workshops and
   material were useful, regular interaction with the media were most useful in using
   newly learned skills. Under the PA subcomponent, collaborative arrangements and
   consultative meetings were conducted to design and develop a communication
   strategy for the program. The program consulted experts on how best to develop of a
   Massive Integrated Public Awareness Services plan. The resulting strategy paved the
   way on how to communicate the Project at national, provincial and districts level with
   the private sector, NGOs and the media industry.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

A. Economic Analysis

The Cost Benefit Analysis of the PAD captured the following key benefits of the
project: (i) improved fisheries, (ii) local products derived from sustainable coral reef
activities, and (iii) associated ecosystem uses, namely tourism. Global biodiversity and
coastal protection benefits, which are considered to be large for rehabilitated coral reefs,
could however not be accounted for, as they are difficult to measure. The economic
internal rate of return (EIRR) is thus a lower bound estimate of the total benefits
associated with the project, since it only compares the quantifiable benefits of the
program to its costs. In particular, the first step is to compute the values of fisheries, local
products, and tourism over 25 years for the case with and without the project. Second, the
net benefit of the program is computed by comparing the two scenarios and is then
discounted by 10 percent to obtain its net present value (NPV). Third, the net benefit and
cost of the project program (both expressed in NPV) are used to calculate the EIRR for
each target district – Pangkep, Selayar, Buton (which split into Buton and Wakatobi in
2003), Raja Ampat, Biak, and Sikka.

The EIRRs computed for the PAD (2005) varied considerably depending on the relative
size and health of the reefs. For instance, the EIRR for Sikka was merely 8 percent due to
its small and low quality coral reefs, whereas Raja Ampat‘s EIRR estimate was 22
percent given the healthy state of its coral reefs at the time (Table 3.1). The PAD also
carried out a sensitivity and risk analysis of the ‗central‘ scenario to test how much the
results depend on the assumed discontinuation of illegal and destructive fishing practices
and the associated quantifiable benefits of healthy coral reefs. This analysis showed that
the results are quite sensitive to these assumptions, leading to very low EIRRs if illegal
and destructive fishing practices continue (the ‗low‘ scenario). In contrast, the EIRR
increases substantially in the ‗high‘ scenario, where improvements in reef quality are
assumed to be much higher than in the conservative ‗central‘ estimate.

The Cost Benefit Analysis of the ICR followed the same methodology as the PAD. In
particular, the EIRRs were computed for each target district from the re-estimated NPV
of improved fisheries, local products, and tourism as well as program costs. These
calculations used the actual data for 2005 to 2011 and ‗central‘ scenario predictions for
all subsequent years. Nonetheless, reproducing the PAD‘s calculations was challenging
due to (i) loss of the original calculations; (ii) lack of data; and (iii) poor quality and


                                              40
inconsistency of the existing data. The following data and approach were thus used for
the cost benefit analysis.5

        District program costs were computed based on the GOI and loan disbursement
         data for each district and province between 2005 and Q3 of 2011.
        The computation of the fisheries value did not use the catch and reef quality data
         collected under the project given the aforementioned quality and consistency
         problems. Instead annual fisheries production data were collected from the district
         fisheries offices. The main problem with these data is that they capture the
         district‘s entire landing data, which include the catch from the coral reefs but also
         the fish caught farther out at sea. Consequently, the annual production of coral
         reefs had to be approximated by scaling the landing data with the district‘s share
         of coral reefs in its total ocean area. The value of fisheries with and without the
         project was then computed for each district using updated average price
         information and the PAD‘s assumptions on profit margins, multiplier effects, and
         fishery yields for the ‗central‘ and ‗without‘ scenario.6
        The value of tourism was calculated using two district-level datasets: tourism
         revenues and GDP figures. The value of tourism with and without the project was
         calculated for each district using assumptions on profit margins, multiplier effects,
         and trends in the tourism sector for the ‗central‘ and ‗without‘ scenario from the
         PAD and its background documents, most notably Cesare (1996).7 Since there
         were missing data for a few districts in the revenue data, an average was
         calculated to obtain the final estimate.


5
         It is important to note that missing data and obvious inconsistencies were corrected through linear
interpolation for all datasets used in this analysis.

6
          The updated price is based on an average of 2011 prices for snapper, grouper, yellow tail fish, and
rabbit fish, which was discounted with the consumer price index to 2005. The following assumptions of the
PAD were used: (i) the net value of fisheries is 80 percent of its gross value/revenue; (ii) fishery has a local
multiplier effect of 2 given the high level of underemployment in all target districts; (iii) the ‗central‘
scenario assumes that after the initial decline yields per reef area will grow at 3 percent for 7 years and then
stabilize.; and (iv) the ‗without‘ scenario assumes that yields will decline by 3 percent annually until they
reach 50 percent and local fisheries collapse.

7
          The following assumptions were used to compute the net value of tourism based on the revenue
data: (i) 50 percent of ‗other‘ expenditures of tourists are added to revenue; (ii) the net value of tourism is
40 percent of its gross value/revenue; (iii) 30 percent of all tourism is related to coral reefs; (iv) tourism has
a local multiplier effect of 2; (v) the ‗central‘ scenario assumes that tourism will grow at 5 percent annually
due to the enhanced attractiveness of the target districts; and (vi) in the ‗without‘ scenario tourism is
assumed to remain constant.

To scale the GDP data, the share of tourism in GDP was computed for 2003, using the tourism value
figures of the PAD. Note that the share for Buton and Wakatobi is in addition scaled by their respective
share in total reef area. The computed shares are in line with the national average of 5% and the numbers of
tourists visiting each district. Assumptions (v) and (vi) are used to predict the GDP-based tourism data in
the ‗central‘ and ‗without‘ scenario respectively.

        The value of other local products and AIGs is approximated by the benefit
         transfers – the village and district grants – as in the PAD. The value of other local
         products and AIGs with and without the project was also calculated for each
         district using the trends assumed for the ‗central‘ and ‗without‘ scenario of the
         PAD.8 However, as has already been pointed out in the main report, the
         expectations regarding AIGs and other local products were unrealistically high at
         appraisal, which is why their net value is much lower than originally anticipated.

The re-estimated EIRRs are broadly in line with the estimates computed for the ‗central‘
scenario of the PAD and range from 5 percent in Biak to 41 percent in Wakatobi (Table
3.2). The discrepancies in the estimates can partly be explained by the differences
between the area treated during the program and the appraisal estimates. Some districts
were also less successful at curbing illegal fishing practices, leading to lower than
expected quantifiable benefits and EIRRs.

        Pangkep experienced some difficulties in reaching out to its communities due to
         its remoteness and lack of wide community involvement in LPSTKs. However, its
         EIRR is still higher than expected, since a coral reef area four times the appraisal
         estimate was actually managed, translating into higher than anticipated fisheries
         values and associated benefits.
        Selayar has an EIRR of only 12 percent compared to the 20 percent estimate of
         the PAD. This result is driven by lower than expected fisheries values, as illegal
         fishing practices declined at a much lower rate in Selayar than in other districts –
         30 percent versus an average of 60 percent and a maximum of 100 percent in
         Sikka. This trend is partly driven by weak enforcement. For example, only 12
         percent of illegal fishing cases were prosecuted in Selayar compared to 70 percent
         in Pangkep and 100 percent in Buton, Wakatobi, and Sikka. However, the
         situation is expected to improve, since a new district police head was appointed

          The following assumptions were used to predict the net value of local products and AIGs: (i) the
‗central‘ scenario assumes that after the initial decline yields per reef area will grow at 3 percent for 7 years
and then stabilize; and (ii) the ‗without‘ scenario assumes that yields will decline by 3 percent annually
until they reach 50 percent and local fisheries collapse.

       recently, who has been specifically tasked by provincial and district authorities to
       prosecute illegal and destructive fishing cases more actively.
      The EIRRs for Buton and Wakatobi are twice as large as the PAD‘s ‗central‘
       estimate for Buton and indeed in line with its ‗high‘ scenario estimate. This good
       performance can be explained by the large national park in Wakatobi, which led
       to a significant replenishment of fish stocks according to CREEL estimates. This
       has particularly benefited fishery yields and tourism revenue in neighbouring
       Buton and substantially increased tourism revenues in Wakatobi.
      The EIRR for Raja Ampat takes into account the entire coral reef area of the
       district, as it is of particular high quality according to the live coral cover
       estimates. These healthy reefs translate into high fisheries values and tourism
       revenues, yielding an EIRR of 16 percent. The fisheries value might even be an
       underestimate, as the total coral reef area only constitutes 3 percent of the
       district‘s vast ocean area, leading to a significant scaling down of the annual
       fisheries production figures.
      The EIRR for Biak is also much lower than expected. The district‘s coral reefs
       suffered extensive damage during the program period due to cyclones, bleaching,
       and the continued practice of blast fishing. This has lowered the fisheries values
       and EIRR significantly.

B. Financial Analysis

The Financial Analysis of the PAD was carried out for the AIGs likely to be supported
by the project. The detailed analysis estimated requirements for (i) capital investment and
working capital; (ii) profit and loss statement; and (iii) financial planning cash flow. The
estimated financial internal rates of return (FIRR) were high, ranging from 16 to 59
percent with a 29 percent average for a representative package of microenterprise
investments. Furthermore, the analysis indicated that revenues would have to decrease by
15 percent and investment costs increase by 70 percent, before the activity were no
longer profitable to pursue.

The Financial Analysis of the ICR followed the same steps of the PAD trying to assess
the financial viability of AIGs. Around 1,450 AIGs were funded through LKMs; a
number, which is five times higher than the original target indicator of 268 (Table 3.3).
However, the size of the funds relative to the target population was generally not
sufficient to allow fishermen to move out of the sector completely. According to a socio-
economic survey conducted by LIPI in 2011, only 6 percent of households obtained loans
that were larger than their net income. The majority received loans that were less than 30
percent of their net income. Therefore, the resources were mainly used for supplemental
income generation activities, such as small scale trading and kiosks (40 percent) and
additional equipment for fishing activities, including the purchase or repair of fishing
gear, body boards, boat engines, and fishing capital (36 percent).

These supplemental income generation activities did not necessarily lead to the hoped for
income gains. For example, sales only increased for 41 percent of economic businesses
after receiving revolving funds, while 48 percent experienced no change and 11 percent
even suffered a decline. In contrast, net income from fisheries is substantially higher for
households that purchased additional fishing equipment. This shows that the low levels of
fisheries production prevalent in the target districts may be increased substantially
through the purchase of additional equipment, giving fishermen greater access to fish
stocks beyond the reef. The data is however not sufficient to identify how these purchases
have affected catch per unit of effort.

Aquaculture activities, on the other hand, usually enabled fishermen to leave the capture
fishing sector with FIRRs that were often considerably larger than the PAD‘s estimates.
For example, a detailed financial analysis of a seaweed culture revealed that the FIRR
was three times higher than the appraisal estimate – with a benefit-cost ratio of 3.96:1 vs.
1.42:1. The main reasons for the difference are (i) lower investment and fixed costs, as
depreciation rates were lower than expected; and (ii) higher income, since seaweed could
be harvested up to 5 times a year, thus increasing revenue considerably (see Table 3.4).
However, despite their high levels of profitability, aquaculture activities are generally
more risky. According to the LIPI survey, only 34 percent of the supported businesses
were still operating at the end of the project as compared to 70-80 percent for the other
sectors. It will thus be crucial to ensure that entrepreneurs receive training to build their
skills and are insured against adverse external impacts.

C. Fiscal Impact Analysis

The Fiscal Impact Analysis of the PAD argued that each district is likely to derive
significant positive fiscal benefits from effective collaborative management of coral reef
resources. It compared the yields each district will derive from degraded fisheries
compared to the yields and benefits associated with sustainably managed fisheries (Table
3.5). The analysis assumed that annual yields per square kilometer of reef would increase
from 5 tons per square kilometer to 30 tons per square kilometer, translating into sizeable
benefits. Large fiscal advantages were also expected from increased tourism revenues if
marine protected areas are managed effectively. The expected increase was estimated at
over 220% over 25 years.

The Fiscal Impact Analysis of the ICR updates this analysis using the actual project
managed coral reef area and updated average price information used in the analysis above.
Note that the average price information is scaled by the local multiplier of 2 to capture
spillover effects as was done for the PAD (Table 3.6). Given the higher price information
and aforementioned changes in the area treated, the approximated benefits rise for all
districts apart from Raja Ampat with particularly large increases for Pangkep, Wakatobi,
and Biak. However, these results come with an important caveat. The predicted increase
in managed fisheries yields used at appraisal seems overly optimistic. Using the average
catch measurements collected during project implementation, the estimated average
annual yields range from 0.04-18.3 tons per square kilometer of coral reef. Given the data
quality and inconsistency problems, these figures should not be taken at face value.
However, they suggest that an increase of 30 tons per square kilometer seems unlikely,
leading to lower than expected fiscal benefits.

In contrast, the collected tourism revenue and GDP data indicates that the expected
benefits from tourism could be even higher than anticipated at appraisal. The estimates
range from an increase of 240 percent in Pangkep and Selayar to 500 percent in Buton
and Wakatobi and even 1,500 percent in Raja Ampat.

In terms of the fiscal sustainability of the program, the project has developed an exit
strategy at all levels to insure continuance of selected activities after the project‘s closing
date. In particular, each district has committed to ensure that project activities are fully
integrated into district programs and funded independently of either donor or national
government resources. The district budget levels provided, cover at least 70 percent of
the PMU‘s operating costs. This level of funding will allow most project activities to
continue unimpeded. At the national level, most activities are being maintained either by
being mainstreamed into existing programs or having special allocations. For example, it
is expected that special allocations will allow CRITC, MIS, and the MPA Scorecards to
be maintained without interruption. Moreover a COREMAP-III design team will
continue working with the Bank. The COREMAP-III request has already been submitted
to the Bank as well as to BAPPENAS and preparations is expected to be completed by
the end of 2012.

                                EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Coral Reef Rehabilitation and Management Program (COREMAP) promotes
sustainable use of Indonesia‘s coral reefs and associated ecosystems (i.e., fisheries,
mangroves, sea grass). The Program utilizes funding from the Government of Indonesia
(GOI) and the World Bank (Bank) for Eastern Indonesia; and the Asian Development
Bank (ADB) for Western Indonesia. In 2011, COREMAP World Bank and ADB
together had activities in a total of 8 provinces, 14 districts and 415 villages. The number
of community residents directly reached by the Project is estimated at 12,500.

The Bank funded Coral Reef Rehabilitation and Management Project, Phase II (referred
to as COREMAP II, Project or COREMAP-II) is the second (i.e., acceleration) phase of a
three part Adaptable Program Loan (APL). The project was built on Phase I‘s wealth of
examples, workable models and lessons to expand COREMAP‘s geographic and
technical scope. COREMAP II‘s design is based on the nation‘s sustainable marine
resource use, decentralization and poverty alleviation goals. The project assisted GOI at
national, provincial and district levels to empower coastal communities to manage coral
reefs and thereby enhance community welfare. Expectation is that COREMAP, Phase III
(COREMAP-III) will be designed in 2012 and implemented from 2013 to 2018.
COREMAP-III will build on lessons learned under Phases I and II, incorporate latest
scientific findings, use socially oriented implementation mechanisms and expand further
COREMAP‘s geographic reach.

COREMAP-II‘s loan, credit and grant agreements were signed on 30 June 2004 with an
effective date of 28 January 2005. However, due to delays caused by the need for GOI to
fulfill 14 loan/credit/grant effectiveness conditions, provide counterpart funding, acquire
office space and put in place operational agreements, activities under the Project began in
earnest in 2006. In part due to the delayed startup, the original loan closing date of 31
December 2009 was extended by 2 years to 31 December 2011.

COREMAP II‘s development goals of equal importance and implemented simultaneously
are to:

   1. Insure biodiversity conservation and sustainable management of coral reef
      ecosystems and related resources;
   2. Strengthen the capacity of communities and institutions to manage coral reef
      ecosystems and resources; and
   3. Lower the incidence of poverty in the Program's coastal communities.

The Project is undertaken at national, provincial, district and village levels. At the
Project‘s apex is its Executing Agency the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries
(KKP). The KKP Minister authorizes organizational structures, operating procedures and
staffing for the national elements of the Project including the: (i) National Steering



                                            51
Committee; (ii) National Technical Committee; and (iii) National Coordinating Unit
(NCU). The NCU under the direction of KKP‘s Directorate General of Marine, Coasts
and Small Islands (KP3K), Directorate of Marine and Aquatic Resources Conservation
(KKJI) is responsible for overall Project coordination, supervision and implementation.
Implementation by the NCU at the national level is supported by 2 National Program
Implementation Units (NPIUs):

      Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) for scientific support; and
      Ministry of Forestry‘s, Directorate of Forest Protection and Conservation (PHKA)
       for marine park support.

At the provincial level, implementation is undertaken by 5 Regional Coordination Units
(RCUs) lead by the provincial fisheries services (Province Dinas KP) located in South
Sulawesi, Southeast Sulawesi, Papua, West Papua and Nusa Tenggara. At the district
level, implementation is provided by 7 Project Management Units (PMUs) lead by the
district fisheries services (District Dinas KP) located in Pangkep, Selayar, Buton,
Wakatobi, Raja Ampat, Biak and Sikka. In each of the Project‘s 358 villages, the project
implementation is handled by a Coral Reef Management Committee (LPSTK) in
coordination with Village Heads.

COREMAP II is comprised of 3 major components: (1) Institutional Strengthening; (2)
Community Based and Collaborative Management; and (3) Public Awareness, Education
and Sea Partnership. The NCU assists across all components with primary responsibility
for Institutional Strengthening, Public Awareness and Sea Partnership Program. NPIU
LIPI undertakes scientific monitoring (coral reef; socio economic) and Education. NPIU
PHKA implements marine park support. PMUs implement most of Community-Based
and Collaborative Management. RCUs focus on all project elements that relate to
provincial levels activities.

The Project measures its performance against two types of indicators:
      Key Performance Indicators (KPIs); and
      Output Indicators.

KPIs measure the Project‘s implementation success against 7 high level outcomes
representing management/empowerment, biophysical and socio economic/poverty
targets. The KPI‘s were originally presented in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD);
and subsequently updated in the Bank‘s Restructuring Plan (January 2010). The Project
has successfully met all of the KPIs, which are under its direct control. Detailed status of
KPIs including remarks, issues to be addressed and related lessons learned appear in
Annex 2.

Details of project implementation success are also measured against 42 Output Indicators.
Output Indicators represent human resource and physical targets. Like the KPIs, the
Output Indicators originally appeared in the PAD. About 20% of the original Output
Indicators were modified in the Bank‘s Restructuring Plan. Generally, the Output


                                             52
Indicators are easily measurable and readily quantifiable. Details of Output Indicator
performance, comments, issues to be addressed and lessons learned are shown in Annex
3. The Project has successfully fulfilled 90%; and partially fulfilled all of the Output
Indicators. Of the partially fulfilled indicators, the most challenging relate to CBM
finance at the village level. For example, the Output Indicator specified a village micro
saving/credit unit (LKM) repayment rate of 75%. In actuality, it averages +/- 60%.

A summary of implementation success described by component finds:

A. Institutional Strengthening

Institutional Strengthening‘s intent is to enhance government institutional responsiveness
to meet the needs of coastal communities and to support coral reef management. The
formation and legalization of program structures at the national, provincial and district
levels proceeded smoothly and reinforced COREMAP II implementation. A target of
30% involvement of women was set and has been met for most project activities. The
Project‘s operational structure has been promulgated through the issuance of SKs by
Ministers, Governors and Bupatis. Follow up SKs detailing assignment of personnel and
duties have been issued annually by the respective directors for the NCU and NPIUs,
Provincial Dinas KP Heads for RCUs and District Dinas KP Heads for PMUs.
Consequently, the NCU, NPIU LIPI, most RCUs and all PMUs were established in a
timely manner, adequately staffed and functioned well. They were able to properly
execute their duties and fulfill assigned responsibilities. NPIU PHKA staff, skills and
motivation are excellent; and as a consequence, the project objectives were generally
attained. Nevertheless, more could have been accomplished with marine park support if
financial constraints had not occurred.

The national Coral Reef Information and Training Center (CRITC LIPI) provided support
to the 7 district CRITCs (CRITC PMUs). The implementing agency for the national
CRITC is NPIU LIPI; and those of the district CRITCs the respective PMUs. CRITC
LIPI monitored reef health at permanent transects, trained local CRITC staff and
upgraded community skills in coral reef and fish health monitoring. All CRITC LIPI
work products (i.e., books, training manuals, atlases, research findings, website) were of
very good quality; and their production executed in a professional and timely manner.
NPIU LIPI‘s management of staff, meetings and budgets is outstanding. CRITC LIPI was
able to effectively train CRITC PMUs and community stakeholders. CRITC PMUs
conducted reef and fish surveys, disseminated information to Village Information Centers
(VICs), trained local stakeholders and helped with collection of reef health, fish census
and socio-economic data. CRITC PMUs generally were able to perform their tasks and
provide useful information for area decision makers and stakeholders. However, CRITC
PMUs only began monitoring operations in 2008; and are still in need of CRITC LIPI
support to insure high quality, reliable results. Coordination between CRITC LIPI and
PMU CRITCs could be improved. CRITC PMUs report to, receive budgets from and
contract through the PMUs - and not through CRITC LIPI. As a result, the linkage
between CRITC LIPI and CRITC PMUs for implementation of district level activities is




                                            53
inconsistent. Also CRITC LIPI did not play the research role, international outreach or
scientific monitoring of marine protected areas as envisaged in the PAD.

Provincial level support was not included in the PAD. It was added in 2006 when it
became apparent that selected activities and coordination amongst districts were best
handled by provinces. RCUs, with the exception of West Papua, were adequately
legalized, staffed and budgeted. RCU West Papua was formed in a new province; and, as
a result of provincial startup, required about 2 years before its office was fully
operational. The MIS Unit, as strengthened by the GOI and the Bank in 2010, is
operating well; and is expected to have a very positive impact in public dissemination of
information in the future.

There are 358 villages included in the project. Each village has a Coral Reef
Management Committee (LPSTK) created under Village Head decrees. No major
problems were encountered with LPSTK formation. LPSTKs needed to be formed
gradually as villages were added to the project and after proper socialization and support
from Community Based Management (CBM) teams. Village Heads have issued 329
village ordinances (Perdes) mostly to formalize community management plans (RPTKs)
and measures, such as the establishment of DPLs. The project also initiated the creation
and then assisted in the intermediate and final drafting of the district regulations (Perda),
which serve as the main instrument enabling passage of District Coral Reef Strategic
Plans (Renstra).

An extensive training program has been undertaken at all project levels. In general, each
year, the NCU and NPIUs have offered 4 workshops and 4 training sessions to their staff,
the RCUs about the same number and the PMUs 10 training sessions and 5 workshops.
The NCU also assisted with Terms of Reference and helped coordinate activities related
to implementation of a sustainable live ornamental fish trade in Pangkep and Buton.

B. Community Based and Collaborative Management

Community Based and Collaborative Management‘s intent is to empower coastal
communities and institutions in project districts to sustainably manage coral reefs and
associated ecosystems to increase community welfare and incomes. This component has
conformed to the strategy laid out in the PAD; and been generally successful in
implementing its objectives. Community Based and Collaborative Management was
project‘s most complex, costly and time consuming element. However, it also reached
the most people, an estimated 10,000 stakeholders. Each district established a Coastal
Community Empowerment Board (CCEB), which proved to be a useful vehicle to
promote understanding of the Project to civil society and external stakeholders such as
fishers, police, navy, women‘s groups and NGOs. The PMUs were quickly established
and generally functioned well. In some cases, where counterpart funds from local
budgets (APBD) were needed, delays did occur due to the late arrival of APBD funds.
However, these delays were mostly encountered in the early years of the Project. As the
PMUs gained implementation skills, they were able to manage their programs to
anticipate and accommodate the late arrival of APBD funds.



                                             54
On average, PMUs used a 95 person Field Team (7 Senior Extension Training Officers
(SETOs); 21 Community Facilitators (CFs); 67 Village Motivators (VMs)) to provide
outreach to the district villages. Each village formed a Coral Reef Management
Committee (LPSTK) with 4 subsections (Pokmas): production, gender, conservation and
monitoring control and surveillance (MCS). Later a village micro saving/credit unit
(LKM) was independently formed. Obtaining Ministry of Finance (MOF) approval for
LKMs required comprehensive documentation and a lengthy series of negotiations,
which resulted in a +/- 2 year delay in LKM implementation. The credit granting process
is ongoing and has been running according in accordance with Project and MOF
directives. About 1,450 AIGs have been realized using LKM funds. However, care needs
to be exercised that these initiatives are truly for alternatives to capture fisheries; and not
just providing supplementary income. Supplementary income provision can even have
an adverse impact allowing for continued unsustainable fishing pressure on reefs. Also,
despite the LKMs following the PAD and GOI guidelines, long term LKM financial
sustainability at current repayment rates (+/- 60%) remains in question.

Based on the Rapid Rural Assessments (RRA) analysis, Coral Reef Management Plans
(RPTKs) were drafted. The RPTKs include at least one protected area No Take Zone
(DPL) in each village. The RPTKs have all been sanctioned by Village Head
endorsements (i.e., Perdes). The Project‘s villages are now much better able to manage
and control coral reefs. Social infrastructure investments are included in the RPTKs and
were funded by the Project. Typical investments included public toilets, freshwater wells,
small surveillance boats, village gates, walkways and boundary markers.

COREMAP II MCS is one of the most successful Project initiatives. A cost-effective,
decentralized system MCS system has been supported in the project villages. Village
MCS units (Pokmaswas) have received training and radio communications equipment.
The goal for each village to be connected by radio to the existing law enforcement system
has been 85% met. COREMAP-II MCS trained civil law enforcement officer (17
Fisheries – PPNS in 2007; 27 Fisheries Inspectors in 2010). Results have been dramatic
with the project MCS helping to reduce illegal/destructive fishing practices by about 60%
from 2,200 infringements in 2005 to 880 infringements in 2010. MCS legal performance
has been excellent too with 70% of recorded illegal/destructive fishing cases prosecuted.

The project supported PHKA and later KKP in marine protected area management. Until
2009, PHKA areas included two marine national parks and four marine protected areas.
In 2009, the 3 KSDA areas (Raja Ampat, Padaido, Kapoposang) were transferred to
KKP. Funding was provided to PHKA for training, workshops, conference attendance,
buildings, equipment, and operational support including socialization of local
communities. KKP park management only received technical support for MCS and MPA
Scorecards. From 2009 to 2011 overall MPA Scorecards showed an impressive 20%
gain indicating a significant improvement in COREMAP-II area park management. All
areas, except Kapoposang KSDA, have shown improvement. Biak showed an especially
strong gain of 115%. Kapoposang‘s deficiencies are now being addressed by KKP.

COREMAP II played a key role in the development of 12 District Marine Protected
Areas (KKLDs). The establishment of these KKLDs added a total 1 million ha of marine
protected areas; and approximately 90,000 ha of No Take Zones. The amount of KKLD
No Take Zones is expected to increase even further as additional zoning takes place in
Sikka, Raja Ampat and Biak. Although considerable work is still remaining to make
KKLD‘s truly effective, their development has been particularly effective in expanding
the potential area under marine protection. KKLDs were not envisaged in the PAD but
were successfully taken up by the Project. District Marine Resources Strategic Plan
(Renstra) have been made in each district. The Renstra‘s are based on the protected areas
of +/- 300 DPLs and 12 KKLDs. The Renstra by its very nature serves to form a network
of marine conservation areas (MCAs).

District Block Grants designed to support AIG activities of a larger scale at the district
level were only partially successful. Only about 50% of the funds allocated was able to be
used. Difficulties in implementation stemmed from (i) lack of familiarity and
understanding of the concept; (ii) Ministry of Finance restrictions; (iii) difficulty to
locate appropriate projects; and (iv) lack of sophisticated institutions and financial
expertise at the district level. These same difficulties were faced by 2 other concepts,
which appeared in the PAD but were not taken up: (i) Credit Guarantee Scheme; and
(ii)_Employment Outside Village. COREMAP-II did undertake two pilot projects, one in
Pangkep and one in Buton, for the sustainable management and certification of aquarium
fish. Ultimately, the initiative can only be considered partially successful. Pangkep
decided to establish a sustainable live ornamental coral reef fish certification program;
but it was cancelled in Buton due to lack of buyer support.

C. Public Awareness, Education and Sea Partnership

Public Awareness, Education and Extension‘s intent is to promote societal awareness of
the benefits of coral reef conservation and sustainable use that leads to behavior change.
This component uniformly met with success; and each of the 4 subcomponents exceeded
PAD targets.

Public Awareness (PA) very effectively communicated COREMAP-II messages. Due to
project PA efforts, a 2010 COREMAP II survey, showed that over 75% of Project area
residents were aware of the importance of coral reefs. PA implemented a strategic media,
public relations and advocacy program to obtain the maximum positive impact by
targeting activities towards key stakeholders. PA campaigns offered directed messages to
promote behavior change such as prevention of destructive fishing, habitat protection,
sustainable fisheries, community programs and regulations. At both national and local
levels, television, radio and print media campaigns were employed to increase the level
of public awareness. Examples include 12 major televisions features, 16 half hour radio
programs (aired +/- 2,700 times over 3 years) and more than 50 TV and radio talk show
appearances by key project managers. Over 50,000 print items such as brochures, books,
pamphlets, manuals, stickers, information kits and calendars were produced per year. PA
even conceptualized; developed and produced a song album entitled ―It’s Umbu Time‖
and then socialized its use at national, provincial, district and village levels. PA provided



                                             56
technical support and materials for numerous events/exhibitions both within and outside
the Project. Importantly, as part of its advocacy program, PA helped to initiate Forjubi
(Forum Jurnalis Bahari Indonesia) to serve as a support group composed of television
and radio journalists.

COREMAP-II‘s PA products have been well received; and are especially appreciated at
the community level. In the villages, community wall newspapers, public announcement
billboards, banners and locally developed public awareness materials were very
successful in increasing the level of awareness and knowledge of the general public. The
VICs, although simple, were stocked with useful materials and serve as popular meeting
places. Public relations outreach and advocacy activities with government organizations,
community groups and private organizations also contributed to supporting Project goals.
In this regard, the involvement of well-known artists, government authorities and
community leaders in the PA campaigns has proven to be invaluable.

The Education subcomponent has also far exceeded the Output Indicators. It is estimated
that approximately 130,000 students attended coral reef education classes (95,000 –
primary; 20,000 – middle; 15,000 – high). Education used a three pronged approach: (i)
developing education materials; (ii) increasing capacity of school institutions and (iii)
increasing support from key stakeholders, particularly from the Ministry of National
Education (Diknas) and its offices at the district level. The Education team developed,
produced and distributed local coral reef and marine education materials (mulok) for
elementary, junior and senior schools. These materials were officially accepted by Diknas’
Curriculum Center. Therefore, all the books have already fulfilled the National Education
Standard, and can be used for schools throughout Indonesia and the results included in
the students‘ reports/certificates. The PAD expected to only reach elementary schools;
but the Project exceeded this goal by including middle and high schools. In all 32,700
books were produced and distributed (17,360 – primary; middle – 10,095; high – 5,345).
In 2011 electronic book versions were included on the Diknas website for downloading
throughout the country. To insure the curriculum was properly covered, 1,225 teachers
were directly trained (645 – primary; 327 – middle; 253 – high). The training followed a
Training of Trainer modality so expectation is this core group was able to train an
additional 4,400 local teachers. In total about 90% of all project districts coastal schools
received teacher training and materials. Education also developed, produced and
distributed additional documents, such as teachers‘ manuals, syllabuses and other
supporting materials. Non formal education was supported through national reef
education events, media promotions and assistance and scientific consultation for
students.

The project was able to utilize KKP‘s existing Sea Partnership Program (SPP) to
dramatically expand Indonesia‘s technically qualified human resource base. Support was
provided to the National Sea Partnership office and its programs. Six months of national
and international advisory services were given at the national level helped to build the
SPP. However, probably the most important impact of the SPP was the large number of
scholarships given at all levels from the high school to Ph.D. In total over 1,500 students
(600 bachelors/masters/Ph.D; 900 high school) received financial assistance to pursue



                                            57
their studies. The positive impact of the enhanced marine education of these individuals
will be felt for generations to come. During breaks in their university studies,
approximately 666 students distributed coral reef management information in coastal
villages. It is estimated that these materials reached about 8,000 people. With SPP
support, districts were able to strengthen their fisheries departments through the use of 84
seconded experts from universities and also by applying the results of 51 responsive
research findings.

Program Support Communications provided Project staff, and to a lesser extent, external
partners and stakeholders, an understanding of COREMAP-II. It was able to
communicate COREMAP-II‘s philosophy, objectives, activities, outputs and outcomes.
To achieve this it developed communication protocols, trained Project staff how to
interact with the media, produced Project info sheets, newsletters and bulletins, made
information kits and press releases on sensitive issues and ran a public relations
campaign. The physical production and dissemination of materials such as logos,
letterheads, info sheets, bulletins and press releases was successfully and relatively easily
accommodated. Similarly, Program Support Communications effectively interacted with
external partners through organization of events, workshops and conferences.

Comments by Borrower on issues related to procurement delays and reliability of
biophysical data raised in Draft ICR
A. On Procurement:
   (i)     Lack of familiarity with Bank‘s administrative and procurement procedures
           by project implementers contributed to project implementation delays.
   (ii)    Communication between the borrower and the Bank‘s Task Team at the
           begining of COREMAP II was weak. More proactivity on the part of the Bank
           in helping the implementing agencies address procurement issues—e.g., by
           providing clear guidance and instructions on how to correct problems—would
           have prevented some of these delays.

B. On Indicators:
   (i)    To avoid data reliability issues in the future in the measurement of coral reef
           health—e.g., using live coral cover and coral fish population abundance under
           COREMAP III, it is suggested that:

               LIPI and District level monitoring should adopt photographic surveys
                because this is the most reliable and replicable methods for objectively
                describing coral reefs. The photos taken from years before can be
                archived for reference to the following years of monitoring, and are also
                very useful for detailed analyses. In a survey site, a photo should be taken
                on permanent transect by applying a quadrat frame, equiped with a
                digital camera.

               Also, populations of coral reef fish can be surveyed by underwater visual
                censuses combined with digital photography along the transect line.
                Fishes that have been succesfully photographed can then be calibrated


                                             58
into their actual length. Using a known relationships between length and
weight, the body weight/mass of each fish can be estimated. Summing
each fish mass across all fishes surveyed along the transect line provides
an estimate of total biomass of the fish assemblage, and allows one to
express fish species abundance in grams per square meter.
