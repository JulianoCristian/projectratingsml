   CORAL REEF REHABILITATION AND MANAGEMENT PROGRAM PHASE II

                                   RESTRUCTURING PAPER




SUMMARY
1.       The proposed changes of COREMAP II respond to recommendations made in the Mid-
Term Review (May 2008) and in the second quarter FY 10 supervision mission to restructure the
project; they are intended to meet project development objectives, to achieve target indicators,
and to facilitate disbursement of remaining funds. This is a second order restructuring and the
major modifications being proposed are: (a) modification of Key Performance Indicators; (b)
changes to project activities by simplifying the implementation of seed fund operations and
cancelling several activities related to the community (partial credit guarantee, district grant, etc);
(c) conducting additional oversight on safeguards; (d) introducing some formalized institutional
changes such as increasing number of participating district from 6 to 7 (as a result of a split in
district boundaries in Buton and the creation of Wakatobi as a separate district), and decreasing
number of participating villages from 416 to 358, as well as a transfer of management
responsibility of certain National Parks to MMAF; (e) introducing a financing plan for
disbursing remaining funds and reallocation of IDA/IBRD; (f) extension of a cumulative two
years from original closing date (now December 31, 2011); and (g) an implementation for
Project extension.

PROJECT STATUS
2.      Past Performance and Implementation Issues.                  Despite initial delays in
implementation and intermittent budget problems, the Project has made important steps in:
introducing the institutional platform for Program management, the necessary policy support and
the development of community programs to promote improved coral reef management. In
particular, the Project has been very successful in raising public awareness. The program is still
making progress on: (i) developing properly managed district conservation areas; (ii)
implementing sustainable community-based management systems that provide recovery and
restoration of reefs and ecosystems; (iii) involving communities in surveillance and monitoring;
and (iv) endorsing local regulations and strategic plans.

3.       On overall program management, the institutional units needed to support the project
are in place. The areas that need to be strengthened are primarily the horizontal level inter-
institutional coordination, and the vertical coordination through institutions at national,
provincial and district levels. There has been slow progress on procurement of goods, which is
attributed mainly to budgetary issues at the local level. This has led to the carrying over of
district plan packages from 2009 to 2010. Continued annual review/monitoring will be provided
to ensure that current arrangements are effective throughout the proposed project extension time.
Issues related to financial management include: (i) the delay of district Parliament and
Government to approve DIPA that contributed to setbacks in disbursement of village grants and
seed funds; (ii) lack of report reconciliation between NCU and RCU/PMU, (iii) lack of technical
assistance and supervision from CFs and SETO to assist community management units and
Micro Finance Unit on financial management aspects; and (v) lack of technical assistance in
implementing District Grants. Local government commitment in implementing the project plays
a significant role in accelerating the approval process of DIPA and the achievement of targets.
Mitigation measures to address these issues have been proposed and are set forth in the proposed
changes section below.
4.      Disbursement. The Project disbursements as of January 13, 2010, are detailed in Table
2. Total disbursement from the IBRD Loan (Loan No. 4740-IND), IDA Credit (Credit No. 3910-
IND), and GEF Grant (Grant No. TF053350-IND) includes advances to the Special Account
(SA). Hence, overall actual expenditure for the Project as a whole is 42%, as of January 2010.

PROPOSED CHANGES
5.      The restructuring program focuses on consolidating and increasing support for activities
in which the Project has been relatively successful, as well as simplifying, deleting and
strengthening implementation processes of activities and existing institutions ( NCU, NPIUs,
PMUs, LPS-TKs, Pokmas, LKM, etc).

   (a) Results/indicators. Most of the KPIs have not been met and results from the review
       process show that the long list of indicators for outcomes and outputs are mixed and at
       times not attributable to the project, and therefore not the best reflection of project
       progress. These need to be rationalized. The incompleteness of useful data (both bio-
       physical and socio-economic) is also an indication of poor project monitoring and weak
       project implementation. Improved coordination and more robust data collection, analysis
       and reporting are necessary. During the November 2009 supervision mission there was
       extensive discussion between the Project team and the World Bank team regarding
       needed revisions to the indicators. Annex 1 shows the project achievements in relation to
       Key Performance Indicators and proposed changes.

   (b) Components. There are no changes to the Project Components. However, the Bank Task
       Team and borrower have agreed on an Action Plan (and reallocation of funds) to
       complete the remaining project activities over the extension period that highlight the
       following:

   ·   Reduce number of participating villages from 416 to 358 villages to maintain and
       enhance the quality of support and results. The change implications will be cancellation
       of activities, cost and revising target output indicators (see Annex 1).

   ·   Strengthen the micro credit program (LKMs) by supporting the 257 already established
       micro credit units at existing villages and establish new micro credit units only at 101
       new participating villages. The Project will no longer support financial intermediaries at
       the District level for disbursing revolving funds but will support the establishment of
       village-level credit and saving facilities (VCSF) in new participating villages and
       strengthen the capacity of existing VCSF which have been established in current
       participating villages to accelerate the delivery of community funds. The change
       implication will require a revision to the legal agreement "Schedule 2;Part B;
       Subcomponent 3;Activity (b).".

   ·   Increase seed fund allocation to well-performing villages in order to improve the
       support for development of income generating activities that go beyond supplementing
       income to shifting to sustainable alternative activities and creating working example for
       other villages. This will involve a change in parties who sign the Village Lending
       Agreement to increase the necessary accountability to ensure sustainability of seed fund
       operations. The implication will be an increased allocation of the seed fund category,
       increased credit size and number of target beneficiaries/village, and will require a change
       of the legal agreement "Schedule 4; Paragraph 12; Activity (b).


                                                6
6.       The Project will also introduce key changes to improve Project performance, including:
     ·   Undertake a special program to improve the approach and capacity of Human
         Resources in the role of coordination. Additional support to human resources only
         outlines a shift in priorities for implementation and expenditure of RCU activities.

     ·   Undertake a special program to improve the commitment of local government. PAD
         "Component 2; Sub-component (4) and Activity 4.1" will provide support to establish
         Coastal Community Empowerment Boards (CCEBs) at the District level, chaired by the
         District Head and consisting of policy makers and stakeholders in the overall coral reef
         ecosystem. Technical assistance and operating costs are provided. Therefore, the
         proposed changes only outlines a shift in priorities to strengthen certain activities,
         through:

         (i). Workshops and meetings between legislative and executive actors at the
         provincial/district level that are supported by the Minister of Marine Affairs and Fisheries
         and the World Bank to encourage increased local government commitments regarding
         COREMAP and the necessary support in terms of budget and regulations and policies
         (perda/perdes).

         (ii). Comparative studies to identify success stories from executive and legislative
         relationships and their coordination at provincial/district levels--from other regions or
         other countries.

7.    Additional support to human resources only outlines a shift in priorities for
implementation and expenditure of NCU and PMU activities.

     ·   Develop successful alternative income generating activities through a comprehensive
         process. This should begin by determining or scaling-up appropriate prospective income
         generating programs (marketable, quick return, and higher value) and followed through
         by providing the appropriate facilitation and technical assistance. The proposed changes
         only outline a shift in priorities for implementation and are in line with the Project design.

     ·   Ensure more intensive monitoring and evaluation as part of the institutional
         arrangements of the Program that support measurement of new outcome indicators. The
         changes proposed only outline a shift in priorities for implementation, which are in line
         with original Project design.

8.       Some basic formal changes will also be a part of Restructuring including:

     ·   Increase the number of participating districts from 6 to 7 as a result of provincial
         restructuring, where one previous district i.e Buton was divided in to two, i.e Buton and
         Wakatobi. Apart from that, so far the project has built a network of community­based
         MCAs in Pangkep, Selayar, Buton, Sikka, Biak and Raja Ampat. Since Wakatobi
         already has a marine protection program under the Wakatobi Marine National Park, the
         project would not plan to create an additional KKLD/District Marine Protected

                                                   7
       Area/Network of community-based MCAs in Wakatobi district. The changes proposed
       will incorporate Wakatobi (formally as a province) into the Project and will also require
       changes to the legal agreement "Article1; paragraph (aa)" and "Schedule 2; Part B;
       Sub-component 4; Activity( c)".

   ·   Cancel all partial credit guarantee programs to avoid conflict with government
       regulations and lengthy processing. The changes proposed will cancel the activity from
       the legal agreement "Part 2; Sub-component 3; Activity (d) and Schedule 4; paragraph
       17; Activity (a)" and fund allocation.

   ·   Cancel the remaining District Block Grant program to avoid conflict with government
       regulations and lengthy processing. District block grants were outlined in the legal
       agreement " Schedule 2; Part B; Sub component 3, Activity (h) " and "Article 1;
       paragraph (i) & (j)" and "Schedule 4; Paragraph 15". The changes proposed will
       cancel the activity from the legal agreement and reallocated to seed funds.

   ·   Cancel the pilot program for carrying out visits by employment agents from participating
       districts and provincial capitals to participating villages in remote areas to evaluate work
       opportunities for fishers and reef gleaners outside the participating village because these
       have been not been well received by communities. This program was outlined in legal
       agreement " Schedule 2; Part B; Sub component 3; Activity (g)". The changes proposed
       will cancel the activity from the Legal Agreement and reallocate funds.

(c) Safeguards

   ·   COREMAP Phase II is classified as a Category B Project. Some safeguards policies are
       triggered but effects are limited in their impact and are technically and institutionally
       manageable (see PAD Technical Annex 10). Safeguards triggered by the Project include
       OP 4.01, 4.04, and 4.10. This Restructuring does not change the technical and
       institutional aspects of the Project, and therefore does not trigger changes to the
       Safeguard status. The existing environmental and social impact framework (ESIMF) still
       applies to the Project but strengthened monitoring will be required to ensure that
       implementation is progressing appropriately.

   ·   The Client continues to develop Coral Reef Management and Park Management Plans.
       The current status is that the Coral Reef Management Plans have been developed
       (incorporating public consultations) at the village levels (i.e. RPTK at 257 villages). A
       review of the village coral reef management plans was conducted on the Second
       Supervision Mission in November 2006 ; and a review of the ESIMF application results
       was undertaken during Mid Term Review in April 2008. During First Supervision
       Mission conducted in January 2006, the Bank recommended the NCU to translate the
       ESIMF in Bahasa Indonesia and distributed them to all PMUs.




                                                8
   ·   Current review deems that the existing IP framework is sufficient due to the limited
       impacts being introduced as a part of restructuring. The only notable activity that could
       have an impact at the community level are part of an additional top up of resources for
       seed funds. These funds are very limited and do not require changing the existing
       framework. The framework was developed based on OD 4.30 and will be reviewed and
       updated to be consistent with OP 4.10.

(d) Institutional arrangements

   ·   Facilitate the transfer of TWAL Kapoposang, SML Raja Ampat, and TWAL Padaido
       from Ministry of Forestry to MMAF to increase management effectiveness. This activity
       is not specified in the Legal Agreement and PAD and the changes proposed will hold
       MMAF accountable with the same standards as MoFor (PHKA) for implementation
       responsibility and financial and procurement arrangements.

   ·   Streamline the role of the RCU. The MTR recommended simplification as well as a
       more concentrated effort on focusing resources for visible and sustainable results on the
       ground. This also applies to the RCU role, which should focus on: (a) advocating support
       from provincial level decision makers to strengthen implementation to address District
       level issues, including budget allocations for timely release of counterpart funds; (b)
       increasing public awareness of COREMAP objectives and enhancing education tools at
       the provincial level to support project Districts in outreach activities; (c) regularly liaising
       with provincial level agencies (e.g. Marine Police, Navy, Judiciary, etc) to strengthen
       monitoring, control and surveillance; (d) advocating uptake of useful models from
       COREMAP districts by strategic non-COREMAP coastal districts within the province,
       (e) reviewing provincial level procedures, rules and regulations for fishing and carrier
       vessels to ensure they support sustainable fishing methods and protection of coral reefs,
       initially in Project Districts, and (f) coordinating technical assistance for needed coral
       reef management research and scientific monitoring to improve management results in
       COREMAP areas. A critical first step will be to define RCU performance targets with the
       COREMAP team over the next two years. Therefore restructuring will formalize the
       coordination role of the Provincial level (RCU) to invest in undertaking the
       aforementioned streamlining and refocus. This requires changes to the Credit Agreement
       and Grant Agreement on "Schedule 4; Paragraph 2."

            ·    Cancellation. The initial amount of the Loan was US$ 33.2 million, Credit SDR 15.7
                 million (US$ 23.0 million Equivalent) and A GEF Grant in the amount of US$ 7.5
                 million. Cancellation of Loan amount USD 3,002,374 was requested by GOI through the
                 MOF letter dated July 7, 2009 and February 4, 2010 to be deducted from the original loan
                 allocation.

       (f) Closing date
       The project was approved by the Board on May 25, 2004 and became effective on January 28,
       2005. The original closing date was December 31, 2009 but the MTR recommended an
       extension to ensure that targets were met. An interim one-year extension is already in place to
       allow time to prepare restructuring plans for the Project without interrupting ongoing activities.
       This Project Paper proposes a restructuring plan and an additional extension of the closing date
       to December 2011 for Loan/Credit No. 4740-IND/3910-IND and GEF Grant No. TF053350-
       IND. Cancellation of Loan amount USD 3,002,374 was also requested. The Project
       Restructuring Plan developed in conjunction with the Government endorses this request for an
       additional 12-month extension through December 2011, to implement the proposed changes.
       Since this is a two-year cumulative Project extension, RVP approval will be required.

Project Development Objective (PDO): to establish viable reef management systems in at least six priority districts, through a financially sustainable
program that is nationally coordinated but decentralized in implementation, in order to empower and to support coastal communities to sustainably co-
manage the use of coral reefs and associated ecosystem resources, which will revive damaged or preserve intact coral reef ecosystems and in turn,
enhance the welfare of these communities in Indonesia.
Revised Project Development Objective: Retained. *The PDO will not change as stated in the PAD, but a discrepancy in the Legal Agreement will
be adjusted to match the PAD.
