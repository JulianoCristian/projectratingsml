                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The objective of the proposed loan, credit and GEF trust fund grant is to establish viable reef management systems in at least six priority Districts, through a
                         financially sustainable program that is nationally coordinated but decentralized in implementation, in order to empower and to support coastal communities to
                         sustainably co-manage the use of coral reefs and associated ecosystem resources, which will revive damaged or preserve intact coral reef ecosystems and in
                         turn, enhance the welfare of these communities in Indonesia.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project has made significant progress during the past year and is now in a better position to meet its development objectives. Measures were taken to improve implementation
                         performance, remove bottlenecks, and better align activities and target outcomes with the project objectives. The project has established an operational presence in all 358 villages
                         currently targeted under the project, and is focusing efforts in the newest of these sites to implement as many of the community-based conservation activities programmed under the
                         project as feasible in the time remaining. There is a broad understanding among the communities of the importance of coral reefs to their welfare and a commitment to protecting the
                         reefs by establishing "no-take zones." The project has provided village grants and access to micro-finance to develop alternative income-generating activities to reduce pressure on
                         reef ecosystems. Six district-level Marine Conservation Areas have been established and are now being consolidated to strengthen their role in ecosystem protection and
                         management.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project was restructured to modify some of the indicators to better support the PDO and to reallocate some loan proceeds in line with implementation targets. There was a partial
                         cancellation of the IBRD funds (US$3 million), but no change in the IDA credit or GEF Grant. A 7th participating district was added resulting from a split in an existing project district,
                         and the closing date was extended.
