The project will support the\n            implementation of the government's population policy\n            announced in March 1991. A program approach has been adopted\n            which will: (1) develop the institutional capacity to foster\n            and manage a comprehensive population program; (2) deliver\n            effective family planning services; (3) generate an\n            increased demand for family planning; and (4) mobilize\n            public awareness and support for the program through\n            government and non-government channels. The project will\n            significantly contribute to improvements in female\n            reproductive health, thus female health in general. The\n            legitimacy of family planning will be strongly enhanced\n            leading to overall improvement in the social welfare of the\n            current generation and ultimately to macro-economic and\n            environmental benefits from moderated population growth.\n            While government policy aims to provide better family\n            planning services nationwide, in the initial phases program\n            strategy will direct efforts to areas of highest population\n            density. Improved family planning services will be fostered\n            through: (a) provision of improved facilities for family\n            planning delivery and counselling, including appropriately\n            equipping the facilities; (b) operational support for\n            management and supervision; (c) staff training in clinical\n            and communication skills; and (d) incremental staffing. The\n            provision of family planning services and the overall\n            population program will be supported through: (i) improved\n            logistics and contraceptive supplies; (ii) enhancement of\n            nongovernment organizations capabilities in this sector;\n            (iii) development of a health promotion center; (iv)\n            population and family planning research; (v) improved\n            collection of demographic data including a demographic\n            health survey in 1995; and (vi) management and program\n            monitoring and evaluation activities."}, "docdt": "1993-03-12T00:00:00Z"}
