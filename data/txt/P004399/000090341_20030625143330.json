The lessons learned show\n            that for project design, indicators are important to assess\n            progress at all levels. Special attention is needed to\n            institutional capacity issues to ensure smooth\n            implementation. Coordination of multi-funding agencies: more\n            manageable for government than separate projects, clear\n            principles for donor coordination need to be established at\n            onset; harmonization of fund channeling, procurement, and\n            reporting arrangements would help a lot, especially in\n            places of limited capacities; pooling of various funds for\n            some projects can simplify implementation. Project design\n            should allow the flexibility to adapt to changing\n            circumstances - economic, financial, social context\n            (restructuring); the capacity of the government to provide\n            adequate counterpart funding needs to be assured, and\n            realistic \"disbursement ratios\" are vital. Project\n            Implementation : need for capacity building across all\n            involved government agencies - example of Ministry of Works\n            - design, procurement, supervision/monitoring and evaluation\n            capacity. Private sector tendering for construction (and\n            design / supervision) appears more efficient and cost\n            effective. Government financial management needs to be\n            streamlined - especially the approval process, and\n            delegation of signing authority to minimize delays in\n            project payments. The availability and continuity of\n            appropriate counterpart staff is critical to the success of\n            a project, and lack of availability and continuity of\n            counterpart staff is a significant contributor to the poor\n            performance of projects. Simplified procurement arrangements\n            and adequate supervision of contractors and consultants are\n            important for effective implementation."}, "docdt": "2003-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
