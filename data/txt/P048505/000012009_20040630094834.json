outcome is rated\n            satisfactory, sustainability highly likely, though\n            institutional development impacts were only modest. Among\n            the lessons learned, the project experience suggests\n            cofinancing as an instrument to prod sector policies, target\n            public investment, and concentrate efforts to alleviate\n            poverty, resulting in addition, in a quick disbursement of\n            loan operations. A flexible financing for recurrent costs\n            might motivate States in pursuing Bank procurement, and\n            expenditure procedures. Another lesson suggests that program\n            implementation should include a participative process,\n            articulated within medium term regional, or sectoral\n            programs, while decentralization should not only include\n            municipalities, but be part of the demand-driven,\n            participatory planning approach. Nevertheless, and despite\n            success, emphasis of future projects should be placed on\n            technical assistance, training, and institutional building\n            at the States, and regional levels, based on existing local\n            institutions (government agencies, municipalities,\n            farmer's organizations, nongovernmental organizations,\n            etc.). Their capacity building should be a fundamental\n            ingredient for success. Moreover, adaptive research,\n            technology transfer, and support services should have a\n            strategic, relevant role on all rural development projects\n            targeting small farmers, so as to provide the required\n            public goods for driving the process, and compensate the\n            limited access to improved technologies, and information."}, "docdt": "2004-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
