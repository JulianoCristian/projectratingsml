{"cdata!": "The Agricultural Productivity\n            Improvement Project for Mexico aims to increase\n            capitalization of small farmers and improve their\n            productivity and income by promoting the adoption of\n            sustainable agricultural production systems, and by\n            providing technical and financial assistance to eligible\n            beneficiaries under a matching grant scheme. There are three\n            components. The first, productive investment, finances small\n            grants for demand-driven subprojects aimed at small\n            irrigation development and modernization, improved pasture\n            establishment and management, and improved dairy production\n            technology and marketing as well as subprojects providing\n            small-scale on-farm infrastructure and minor equipment and\n            supplies. The second component, production support services,\n            includes financial support for applied research and\n            technology transfer as well as demand-driven extension, and\n            technical assistance and training to small farmers. The\n            third component, institutional strengthening and project\n            administration, supports training and technical assistance\n            to staff with implementation responsibilities at the central\n            and state levels, with particular emphasis on preparing\n            subprojects, selecting mechanisms and procedures, developing\n            and implementing a comprehensive monitoring and impact\n            evaluation system, and establishing and operating a project\n            coordination team."}, "docdt": "1998-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
