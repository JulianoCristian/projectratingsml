 Implementation Completion Report's (ICR) ratings for\n            the On-Farm and Minor Irrigation Networks Improvement\n            Project of a satisfactory project outcome, likely\n            sustainability, and substantial institutional development\n            impacts, concerning the Irrigation and Drainage Sector\n            Project the audit downgrades its project outcome to\n            satisfactory, and sustainability to likely, but concurs on\n            substantial institutional development impacts; and,\n            regarding the Agricultural Productivity Improvement Project,\n            the audit also downgrades its project outcome to\n            unsatisfactory, sustainability to unlikely, and\n            institutional development impacts to negligible. The\n            assessment confirms the following OED lessons of broader\n            relevance. Projects need to dovetail with programs; but\n            well-designed projects can rarely turn around a\n            poorly-designed program. This is a particularly important\n            lesson for the Bank's work in Mexico where leverage is\n            limited. Mexico has ample access to alternative sources of\n            funding, private as well as public. In line with the\n            Bank's poverty reduction mandate, its resources should\n            be tightly targeted, rather than added to programs where\n            there is a high potential for subsidies to be captured by\n            better-off groups. The Bank's leverage may be\n            substantially diluted when project funds flow into a\n            multi-state program which state governments have\n            considerable influence over the use to which resources are\n            put. Large Programs are candidates for formal impact\n            evaluation. In this case, the main limitation of the Alianza\n            evaluation was the absence of a control group of\n            non-beneficiaries, a striking oversight given the level of\n            funding committed. The evaluation should have sampled those\n            who did not apply to the program; and those who did but were\n            rejected. (It is not clear that a list of the rejected is\n            maintained.) Without this control it is impossible to assess\n            claims about the program's leverage: much of the\n            investment (and the income growth attributed to it) might\n            have occurred without a subsidy. Subsidies may have leaked\n            to better-off groups who don't need them."}, "docdt": "2005-07-22T00:00:00Z"}
