{"cdata!": "The Ex-Combatants Reintegration Project\n            for Djibouti aims to effectively facilitate the social and\n            economic reintegration of ex-combatants into civilian life\n            through targeted multi-sectoral assistance--validating, in\n            the process, this innovative approach for an envisaged\n            follow-up operation. There are four main components. The\n            first, social mobilization, contains a social communication\n            sub-component for sensitizing the local population, using\n            various media; and a counseling and referral service for\n            ex-combatants, offering economic and psycho-social\n            counseling and employment referral. The second finances an\n            economic reintegration fund offering a range of support\n            measures for skills enhancement and micro-enterprise\n            development. The third component funds social reintegration,\n            supporting small-scale social infrastructure and activities\n            aimed at reinforcing social cohesion in the ten most\n            severely affected communities. The fourth component assists\n            the rehabilitation of disabled ex-combatants, providing\n            medical services, and prostheses and other aids along with\n            special rehabilitation training and special services to the\n            severely disabled."}, "docdt": "1998-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
