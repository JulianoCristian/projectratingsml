Negative lessons learned include: a) the IBRD\n            should have supervised FIS closely and with greater\n            frequency; b) the traditional social fund subproject\n            processing cycle, procedures, and internal controls are\n            essential to efficient FIS operations; c) the outside\n            creation and imposition of new organizations on communities\n            is not recommended; d) community training in subproject\n            operations and maintenance is critical to subproject\n            sustainability; and e) to be effective, studies should be\n            based on genuine institutional interests and needs, terms of\n            reference should clearly define objectives and expected\n            outputs, contracting should be timely, and a system should\n            be in place for result dissemination."}, "docdt": "1999-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
