Dear Mr. Minister:
Re: 
GUATEMALA - Social Investment Fund Project (Ln No. 3534 GU)
     Amendment to the Loan Agreement
We have received a request from Dr. Rodolfo Paiz Andrade, Executive President of 
FIS, by letter of September 29, 1997, to amend Schedule 4 of the Loan Agreement of 
September 29, 1993, to allow for higher limits for quotations. We agreed that this 
seems justified and propose:
(a)
in part C.1 of Schedule 4, to replace the amounts of $55,000 and 
$30,000 with $100,000 and $50,000, respectively; and
(b)
in part C.2 of Schedule 4, to replace the amounts of $55,000 and 
$30,000 with $100,000 and $50,000, respectively, as well as to 
replace the 
amounts of $6,000,000 for Civil Works and $100,000 
for Goods with $3,000,000 
for Civil Works and $4,000,000 for 
Goods.”
If you agreed, we would appreciate receiving a signed copy of this amendment 
letter.
Your sincerely.
