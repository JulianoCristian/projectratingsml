H33AJIDUN AND RNCONMOEDATION OF TME PRESIDENT OF TU IBMRD
TO 29E SZECUTIYK DIRECTORS ON A PROPOED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF GUATIMALA
FOR A SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommndation on a proposed loa.a to the Republic of Guatemala for US$20
million equivalent to help finance a Social Investment Fund (SiF) project.
The proposed loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with
a maturity of 20 years, including five years of grace. The project would be
co-financed with other donors for US$36.7 million. The total pr(ject cost is
estimated at US$80.0 million.
2.        BacgKqond. Guatemala's social indicators are among the worst for
countries with similar per capita national Income in Latin America. Infant
mortality rates average 62 per 1,000 (with over 100 per 1,000 in some of the
poorest rural areas), and malnutrition, which has worsened in recent years,
stunts the growth of more than half the children of the rural poor. Only 60
percent of children in rural areas attend school, and more than half repeat
first grade. Less than 30 percent of the existing 15,000 small rural
settlements have a reliable supply of potable water. As a result,
gastrointestinal diseases continue to be the maia cause of infant mortality.
Underemployment is severe, particularly among low-income populations living in
the rural areas and the outskirts of cities. Social neglect and extreme
poverty are long-term structural problems rooted in the acute inequality of
income and wealth, the great cultural diversity of the society, and the
excessive centralization of public administration. These problems reflect low
and ill-targeted Government social spending and the failure over many years to
involve the communities themselves, NGOs, and the private sector in the attack
on poverty.
3.        The present democratically-elected Government is determined to
improve living standards ;n poor rural areas. The Government is seeking to
expand social sector investments, improve targeting, and strengthen
institutional capacity in line ministries to better pursue poverty alleviation
and intends to decentralize and improve the management of these Ministries and
agencies. However, line ministries and agencies responsible for providing
social services (i.e., health, nutrition, education, and potable water), have
a limited capacity to expand coverage to poor rural villages due to excessive
centralization, cumbersom bureaucratic procedures, the scattered nature of
the settlements, and difficult topography.  Effective decentralization of the
bureaucratic apparatus will take years. In the short run, the Government
would address some of the needs of the most vulnerable rural groups through
the proposed Sir to prevent a deterioration in the already precarious living
standards of the poor during the adjustment period. These intentions are
expressed in a Letter of Social Sector Development Policy which provides a
framework for the proposed project.
4.        Th. Social Investment Fund.  The SIP would combine poverty
alleviation and employment objectives through the provision of financing fort
(i) social assistance subprojects in health, nutrition, and education targeted
to women and young children; (ii) social infrastructure subprojects such as
rehabilitation of health posts, schools, water and sewerage systems; (iii)
economic infrastructure subprojects such as public markets, road improvement,
retention walls and drainage works; and (iv) credit at market rates to small



informal sector entrepreneurs. SIP is not an executing, but a financing
agency. Subprojects would be executed by decentralised entitles such as
private local contractors, NGOs, municipalities, or community groups. To make
8I as effective and efficient as possible, an independent Executive President
coming f:otom the private sector ham been identified, staff has been carefully
selected, and there would be close vigilance by foreign donors. SIP's
operational procedures and practices have been soundly designed and would be
strengthened further under the proposed project. SIP would be audited
annually by private external auditors, acceptable to the Bank, who would also
undertake a quarterly audit combining financial review, physical inspection of
works, and verification of procurement for subprojects.
5.        SIP-financed subprojects would be targeted to the poor.  SIP aims
at a nationwide coverage (excluding Guatemala City, which benefits
disproportionately from Government programs and assistance from foreign donors
and non-governmental organizations (NGos)), but more funds would be allocated
to poorer municipalities based on a poverty index reflecting housing
condition, basic sanitation, water supply, basic education, and basic needs
indicators. Information provided by its monitoring system would allow 8IF to
strengthen its promotion in municipalities with a shortfall of subprojects and
provide technical assistance for subproject preparation, when necessary.
6.        Cost-recovery is one of the important subproject selection criteria
and takes distinct forms depending on the type of subproject. In the case of
social lnfrastructure, local committees would be formed and trained to
maintain schools and health facilities financed by SIP. In the case of water
and sewerage, local communities would set up tariffs and administer revolving
funds to recover sufficient resources to cover the costs of operation and
maintenance. In the case of social assistance subprojects, fees would be
charged for those services or items where feasible; for example, modest fees
for medicines to replenish stock..
7.        Rationale for pank Involvement. The Bank'. strategy is to support
Government social sector improvements through the reallocation of resources to
the sector (under the proposed Economic Modernization Loan), the improvemnt
of the education sector through the Second Basic Education Loan (Ln. 3003-GU,
January 1990), and a lending operation to help improve the health and
nutrition sector proposed for FY94. The proposed project would offer the Bank
an opportunity to make progress in dealing with poverty alleviation in a
country where little has been done to date to target assistance to the poor.
It would also give the Bank the opportunity to support activities initiated by
municipalities, local community groups, MGos and the private sector, pursue a
variety of promising pilot schemes, assist in consolidating scattered domestic
efforts and help coordinate donor assistance.
S.        The Bank has taken a leading role in helping the Government
structure this project to focus mainly on poverty alleviation. The Bank and
the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) have helped prepare the
project and based experience gained from other similar projects (in Bolivia,
Honduras, and Nicaragua).
9.        Proiect objectives.  The objectives of the project are to helpt
(a) create a means of responding flexibly and efficiently to socio-economic
needs as identified by poor local communities, with special focus on
indigenous communlties and women's groups; (b) target scarce existing
resources more effectively to improve the health, nutrition, basic education,



-3-
and Income-earning potential of the poor; and (c) strengthen the coverage and
quality of basic human needs services while the line ministries are being
strengthened to better serve the rural population.
10.       fRxigSt Dscrig&ion.  The proposed project would support the SIF's
operations during the initial half of its legal 8-year life. It would have
three componentes (a) SIF Subproiects (US$68.0 million, equivalent to 85.0%
of total project cost) coverings (i) social assistance subprojects (17.0%)
Including cmmunity health, food and nutrition, and basic education  (Ui)
social infrastructure subprojects (41.6%) focusing on the rehabilitation and
maintenance of health, water, sanitation, and education infrastructure; (iii)
economic infrastructure subprojects (17.9%) including the rehabilitation of
small irrigation systems and access roadsl and (iv) productive sector
subprojects (8.5%) including the capitalization of revolving funds operated by
NGOs (non-Bank-financed); (b) SIP Administration (US$8.0 million, equivalent
to 10.0% of total project cost) including: (i) operating costs (6.5%); (ii)
equipment (0.75%) including vehicles and computers; (iii) technical assistance
and training for SIr staff (1.75%); (iv) monitoring and evaluation (0.75%);
and (v) contingencies for equipment and cechnical assistance (0.25%); and (c)
Strenothenina of Sjonsorina and Executing oaencies (US$4.0 million, or 5.0% of
total project cost), consisting of technical assistance and equipment for
institutions and community groups working with the SIF.
11.       The total project cost is estimated at Us$80.0 million equivalent
with a foreign exchange component of US$20.8 million equivalent (26%). The
proposed US$20 million Bank loan would finance 25% of total project costs. A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and meth 's of procurement and disbursement and the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in Guatemala are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 11060-GU, dated November 5, 1992
is also attached.
12.       Project Implementation.  SIP would be the project executing agency.
Its proposed management, staffing criteria, and procedures for the
identification, preparation, appraisal, and implementation of subprojects were
revLewed by the Bank and found satisfactory. SIP's proposed management is
satisfactory to the Bank. NGOs would be expected to play an important role in
project implementation.
13.       Lessons From Previous Bank Involvement.  The following lessons
learned from experience with SIFs were incorporated into the project designs
(a) SIF would be a semi-autonomous organization to: (i) avoid political
influence on management, (il) allow to pay competitive salaries and recruit
high-quality staff, and (iii) permit simplified procurement procedures
necessary for fast subproject implementationj (b) to ensure efficiency and
transparency of operations, 8I's design woulds (i) use a standardized menu
of subprojects which results in efficient subproject implementation by
limiting the required range of SIP specialists, providing standard parameters
and specifications for sponsors in subproject preparation, and facilitating
subproject appraisal and supervision by SIP stafft (ii) use an Operational
Manual with clear eligibility and e-praisal criterial (ill) use a targeting
mechanism based on a poverty map us_ng population and poverty criteria,
allowing allocation of funds to each municipality, while providing for
additional funds to poorer municipalities; (Lv) provide for additional
promotion and support for subproject preparation by SIF in poorer



-4-
municipalities; (v) require annual financial audits and quarterly operational
audits to show SIV's transparency, an edsential element in attracting external
funds; and (vi) include annual reviews to assess project performance and
improve implementation.
14.       actions Aareed.  During neaotiations, agreements were reached,
satisfactory to the Bank: (i) on a Letter of Social Sector Development
Policy; (ii) that appointment of SIFrs Executive President would be subject to
prior Bank consultation; (iii) that productive subprojects would not represent
more than 10% of SIP financing; (iv) that any change to the Operational Manual
would require the Bank's prior approval; (v) that subprojects costing more
than US$100,000 and one subproject per year in each Bank-financed sub-program
(as defined in Annex 4 of the Staff Appraisal Report) would require the Bank's
prior.approval; (vi) that the Borrower would use satisfactory procurement
procedures and review the standard regionalized unit prices for goods and
works twice yearly and adjust these prices if so recommended by such review,
satisfz;_ory to the Bank; (vii) on the amount of funds to be contribute-, by
the Borrower to SIP and on the schedule of disbursements of funds throughout
the project implementation period and the timing thereof; (viii) that
quarterly and annual audits would be carried out by external auditors on the
basis of acceptable sets of accounts; (ix) that SIP would provide satisfactory
semi-annual reports to the sank; (x) on terms of reference for consultants to
prepare the studies to be reviewed during the annual reviews; and (xi) the
Borrower would carry out annual reviews of SIP, would discuss the results with
the Bank, and would implement actions agreed upon as a result of this review.
In addition, assurances were provided at negotiations that the Borrower would
undertake to provide US$8.0 million to SIP by September 30, 1994, in case no
other sources of financing would be available.
15.      Sfiecial Conditions of Effectiveness would be:  (i) creation of the
SIP by Decree or Decrees, on terms acceptable to the Bank; (ii) a finalized
Operational Manual, satisfactory to the Bank; (iii) a signed technical
assistance contract, satisfactory to the Bank, between UNDP and SIF; (iv)
signed cooperation agreements between SIr, line ministries, and the MOP,
satlsfactory to the Bank; (v) implementation of an initial MIS system; (vi) a
signed funding agreement of US$0.7 million between the Borrower and UNDP,
satisfactory to the Bank; and (vii) that evidence of funding agreements
totaling US$28.0 million equivalent between SIP and BCIE and KfW,
respectively, would have been presented to the Bank and that these agreements
would have been submitted to the Guatemalan Congress.
16.       Remedies of the Bank. Should funding agreements totaling US$28.0
million between the Borrower and BCIE and KfW, respectively, not have been
signed and become effective no later than six months after the effectiveness
of the Bank loan, this would constitute an event of default.
17.       Environmental Aspects.  The project has an environmental B rating.
Appropriate measures would be incorporated in the Operationai Manual to
safeguard physical and cultural resources and to strengthen local capacity in
environmental protection.
18.       proiect Benefits.  By providing resources to poor urban and rural
communities, $IF would help tot (i) prevent deterioration in the living
standards of the poor during the period of economic adjustment; (LL) improve
basic health and education facilities currently deteriorated and lacking basic
equipment to operate; (iii) reduce incidence of water-borne diseases by



-5
expanding coverage of water and sanitation; (iv) improve health, nutrition,
and literacy, particularly among women and children; and (v) strengthen the
Government's experience with a decentralized mechanism for delivering
development assistance to municipalities and small businesses and mobilizing
grassroots efforts, which could subsequently be used by other agencies.
19.       SIP would strongly encourage the participation of women and
indigenous groups. Many of the types of subprojects the SIr would finance
directly benefit women and/or indigenous groups and would be strongly
promoted. The demand-driven mechanism used by SIP would support the
Government's objective to involve community organizations, particularly
women's groups, actively into the development process. Since the existence of
a local cormmlttee and provision of counterpart financing from the community
would be requirements for most SIF subprojects, the SIF would provide a
systematic channel for women and indigenous groups participation in the
improvement of the well-being of their households and communities. Womea's
and indigenous groups would be able to submit subprojects directly to the SIP
without having to go through the formal political structure, where they may
lack power. In addition, these groups would receive technical assistance from
the SIF to help them prepare subprojects. Moreover, one of the evaluation
studies would specifically address SIP's performance in reaching target
groups, including women and indigenous groups. Participation of indigenous
groups would be facilitated in particular by: (J) targeting of poorer
municipalities, where indigenous populations are concentrated; (ii) preparing
promotional materials in the local language and employing promotional staff
conversant in the local dialect; and (iii) requiring SIF promoters and
appraisers to ensure that subproject proposals reflect the preferences of
beneficiaries.
20.      RZ24ect  Risks.  The main risk is that resources could be diverted
to uses not envisaged in the project. Drawing on the experiences of the
Bolivian Emergency Social Fund and Honduran SIr, the project incorporates a
good information system, maintenance of a highly competent staff, close
supervision, and regular auditing into its design, thereby reducing this risk
substantially. A second risk is that some communities and institutions may
not be willing to participate in a government-sponsored program. However, the
emphasis placed on transparency of operations should convince these groups to
participate once they have experienced how the SIP operates. A third risk is
the setting up of an entirely new institution in a country with a mixed
history of project implementation. To counter this risk, the SIP would be
excluded from civil service restrictions on remuneration to enable them to
attract the best qualified staff. UNDP would coordinate an extensive
technical assistance program.
21.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
