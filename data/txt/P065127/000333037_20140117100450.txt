1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.     Economic situation at appraisal. At the time of appraisal in 2004, Guinea had a
population of 8 million and a Gross National Income (GNI) per capita of United States Dollars
(US$) 410. In 2004, the overall poverty rate for the country was estimated at 40 percent, with a
poverty rate of 53 percent in rural areas and 25 percent in urban areas. In 2002, International
Monetary Fund programs and the Highly Indebted Poor Income Country (HIPIC) initiative were
suspended due to the country’s political instability.

2.     State of Guinea’s basic infrastructure at appraisal. At the time of appraisal, the
country’s stock of basic infrastructure, such as public buildings, schools, health centers, markets
and processing facilities, remained largely in disrepair and wholly inadequate for the country’s
economic development needs.

3.      Since the mid-1990s, armed conflicts in the sub-region (primarily Sierra Leone, Guinea
Bissau, Liberia and Cote D’Ivoire) had taken a heavy toll on Guinea, causing an influx of
refugees and internal dislocation of the Guinean population increasing the pressure on an already
weak infrastructure base. The Government’s main policy was to re-establish security, while
promoting development partner projects and Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) efforts in
the affected areas. While international assistance was forthcoming for the international refugees,
only limited funding was mobilized to assist displaced Guineans or to help rebuild destroyed
infrastructure in affected communities. To address this problem, the Government of Guinea
(GOG) proposed an emergency rehabilitation program to rapidly restore basic infrastructure in
the hardest hit areas, to facilitate the return of internally displaced persons, and enable the pursuit
of poverty reduction objectives in these zones.

4.     The road sub-sector. In 2004, the road network consisted of about 7,000 kilometers of
national roads, 6,700 kilometers of prefectural roads, 20,000 kilometers of rural roads, and 1,000
kilometers of urban roads. Responsibility for the management of the road network rested with
the Ministry of Public Works (MPW). The National Directorate for Rural Roads (Direction
Nationale des Pistes Rurales, DNPR), which at the time of appraisal was housed at MPW, was in
charge of managing the prefectural and rural road network.

5.     The Road Maintenance Fund (Fond d’Entretien Routier, FER) was established in 2000 as
a public enterprise under the responsibility of MPW, tasked with the administration of funds
destined for the maintenance of the eligible road network. The FER was endowed with funds
from a fuel levy and subsidies from the national budget. In 2003, the FER collected Guinean
Franc (GNF) 16.5 billion in user fees, which amounted to about 51 percent of its resources.
However, that amount was barely sufficient to cover half of the routine maintenance needs of the
paved network, leaving the community and prefectural networks largely under maintained.

6.      Post-harvest infrastructure. Competitiveness of rural producers was stymied by high
farm-to-market intermediation costs due to the lack of an efficient network of rural
infrastructure. The shortage of basic post-harvest and agricultural infrastructure was the key

                                                  1
constraint to export-led growth in agriculture. The World Bank-supported Agricultural Export
Promotion Project (PCPEA) implemented between 1993 and 2002, failed to capitalize on
Guinea’s considerable export potential. Nevertheless, PCPEA succeeded in the elimination of
duties on agricultural inputs and created a “one stop shop” export facilitation center (Centre de
Facilitation des Exportations, CAFEX). CAFEX which operated from user fees and budgetary
allocations had streamlined export documentation and procedures.

7.      The Government’s policies and plans. Fostering sustainable and equitable growth and
improving coverage and quality of basic social services were the key priorities of the GOG, as
stated in the country’s Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRSP, July 2002). In the context of the
International Development Association (IDA) support to the GOG, these objectives were to be
achieved through: (i) rehabilitation of essential social infrastructure that was damaged during the
border intrusions; (ii) rehabilitation of the country’s rapidly deteriorating road network; (iii)
construction of selected economic infrastructure; and (iv) building capacity to ensure that the
improved infrastructure are managed in an environmentally and socially sustainable way.

8.      The Project. Within this context, three priority needs were identified to be financed by
the Second National Rural Infrastructures Program (Programme National des Infrastructures
Rurales, PNIR2): (i) Improvement of rural roads and construction of 6 rural bridges to improve
all weather accessibility and access to markets and economic opportunities; (ii) Emergency
rehabilitation in war-affected areas to restore key rural buildings in targeted areas; and (iii) Pilot
agricultural logistics platforms to improve the collection and marketing of potato, mango and
citrus. PNIR2 was also designed to complement community-level activities supported by a
previous Bank funded project Village Community Support Program (PACV) (P065129). PNIR2
focused on the prefectural network which ensured access to the Rural Development
Communities (Communautés Rurales de Développement, CRD) covered by PACV.

9.      At the time of appraisal, donor assistance was largely focused on small-scale community
level investments or on national highways, leaving the prefectural roads and other medium scale
infrastructure (public buildings and commercial infrastructure) without financial support. Since
the prefectural road network was the physical linkage of the CRDs with basic infrastructure and
markets, it was essential to invest in its rehabilitation and also to establish a sustainable
mechanism for its management and maintenance. That is why PNIR2 was primarily designed to
support the country’s objective of maintaining a stock of basic infrastructure assets, and also to
assist the Government in establishing sustainable rural infrastructure maintenance and
management systems.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

10.   The PDO. The Development Objective as stated in the Project Appraisal Document
(PAD) was to provide improved basic infrastructure and sustainable infrastructure management
and maintenance systems to rural populations in targeted areas.

11.    The key performance indicators were: (i) 59 CRD have all-weather access to their
prefecture centers and 800,000 inhabitants have all-weather access to their prefecture centers; (ii)
23 CRD have restored public services in health, education, police and public administration. 11

                                                  2
CRD have all weather access to their prefecture centers; (iii) The pilot logistics platforms
contribute to increased revenue of target population (value of products passing through the pilot
logistics platforms). Key Performance Indicators (KPI) were formulated slightly different in the
Development Credit Agreement (DCA) and the PAD. The DCA page 32 indicates “Seventy (70)
CRDs have achieved all-weather access to their prefecture centers no later than the Closing
Date”. In the PAD, it is split into two indicators (59 and 11 CRD have all-whether access to their
prefecture centers. The reason for this distinction in the PAD was that 59 CRD were for road
rehabilitated through conventional construction approach and 11 CRD for roads rehabilitated
through labor based construction approach.

12.     To sustain the project impact, the project aimed at ensuring that funds were made
available through the FER in a timely manner and were expected to progressively increase to
meet the maintenance requirements of the prefectural road network. The minimum annual targets
of prefectural roads to be maintained under FER financing were: (i) 1,400 km for 2005; (ii) 1,540
km for 2006; (iii) 1,694 km for 2007; and (iv) 1,863 km for 2008.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
    reasons/justification

13.    The objectives of the project were not revised. However, the project was restructured four
times mostly to extend the closing dates and the Key Performance Indicators were formally
revised once on June 30, 2011. What follows is a short description of the four restructurings.

   (a) December 12, 2005: This restructuring was necessary to update the DCA in light of the
       transfer of responsibility for rural roads from MPW to MA (see paragraphs 24 below).
       This allowed the project to be declared effective in October, 2005.
   (b) November 15, 2007: Following the change in the IDA country financing parameters for
       Guinea, the project’s IDA disbursement percentage was increased from 80 percent to 100
       percent.
   (c) January 30, 2011: This was a batch restructuring for the whole Guinea portfolio
       following IDA’s reengagement, to retroactively extend the closing date of projects which
       were closed during the period of suspension. The projects closing date was retroactively
       extended from December 31, 2009 to June 30, 2013.
   (d) June 30, 2011: Following IDA’s reengagement in Guinea and the subsequent reactivation of
       the credit after two years of suspension, the fourth project restructuring was required to: (i)
       revise the scope of project components in light of project activities cost overruns, and in
       order to maximize the project’s impact; (ii) revise the project’s results framework, and
       (iii) amend the DCA to cancel outdated clauses and covenants, and to create a new
       category of expenditure that merged some of the existing categories of the project. The
       PDO was not changed.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

14.     The rural population of targeted CRDs (estimated at 800,000 people) was expected to
benefit from the project’s rural roads improvement program which would result in improved all-
season accessibility and better access to social services and economic opportunities. 23 strife-
affected CRDs were to restore their basic infrastructures (schools, health centers, and public
buildings) which were destroyed by wars in neighboring countries. Furthermore, the labor-
intensive civil works were expected to provide employment opportunities in 11 CRDs.
                                                        4
15.     Producers Organizations (PO) of potato in the Fouta Djallon, and mango and citrus in the
Kankan region were expected to benefit from the two pilot logistics platforms which were to
significantly improve the value-chains of those products and reduce post-harvest losses. The
capacity activities of the project targeted the project implementing agency’s staff and other
stakeholders contributing to the project implementation. With the restructuring of the project, the
targeted number of beneficiaries decreased proportionally with the reduction in project scope.

1.5 Original Components

16.    The project had four components which were:

17.    Component A: Rural Roads US$23.9 million (Bank financing US$22.8 million):
Achieving all season access through rehabilitation of intermediate level prefectural roads and
supporting road sector management reforms for roads maintenance.

          Spot repairs on priority roads (Routes Prioritaires, RP1)and key bridges, linking CRD
           centers with the national road network;

          Provision of goods and technical advisory services and carrying out of training and
           audit activities for establishment of a coherent road network management program
           within MTP, including: (i) acquisition of vehicles, motorcycles, and information
           technology equipment for DNPR; (ii) carrying out of road maintenance organization
           and management studies and provision of technical advisory services to MTP and
           DNPR; and (iii) formulation and implementation of a training program for DNPR;

          Rehabilitation of 920 km of prefectural roads in 34 CRDs; and

          Construction of 6 priority rural bridges.

18.     Component B: Emergency Reconstruction US$7.5 million (Bank financing US$5.0
million): Assisting rural populations in war-affected areas to restore basic social services through
the reconstruction of damaged or destroyed public buildings.
          Rehabilitation of public buildings in the following prefectures: Faranah, Forécariah,
           Guéckédou, Kindia, Kissidougou, Macenta, and Mamou.

          Rehabilitation by local Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) and NGOs of RP2
           roads, linking roads within and between CRD centers, in Beyla, Boké, Dabola,
           Gaoual, Guéckédou, Kissidougou, and Mamou prefectures, and provision of technical
           advisory services to such SMEs and NGOs for such rehabilitation.

19.    Component C: Pilot Commercial Infrastructure:
          Activities as follows in areas of product sourcing, export marketing, quality
           assurance, and contract management skills for market development pilot programs in
           Timbi-Madina Potato Center and Kankan Mango and Citrus Center;


                                                 5
            Carrying out of studies for and establishment of logistics platforms for purposes of
             handling of fruit and vegetables; and

            Provision of technical advisory services and training to private entities managing
             logistics platforms.

20.     Project Management US$1.9 million (Bank financing US$1.5 million): Ensuring the
project is managed in compliance with legal and fiduciary requirements as stated in the Credit
Agreement.

21.     The Rural Roads and Pilot Commercial Infrastructure Components were selected as key
priorities under the PRSP and based on lessons learnt on past accomplishments and Bank
projects. The Emergency Reconstruction Component was identified in the Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) as a key area of intervention, in view of Guinea’s undue burden resulting from
instability in the sub-region.

1.6 Revised Components

22.    The project scope and components were revised in June 2011 as detailed in the table
below.

1.7 Other significant changes

23.     Implementation arrangements. At the time of appraisal the DNPR was part of the
MPW and was responsible for the implementation of the Rural Roads and Emergency
Infrastructure components of the project. The implementation of the Pilot Commercial
Infrastructure Component was to be contracted to CAFEX to manage the design, bidding, works
supervision and equipment installation.

24.      However, shortly thereafter, the Ministry of Agriculture (MA) challenged the fact that
rural roads were the responsibility of MPW due to the fact that the rural road network was
critical for access to agricultural production area. Thus, after much debate, GOG decided to
transfer3 the responsibility for rural roads from the MPW to MA. Hence, the DCA of PNIR2 had
to be amended to effect the change in project responsibility.

25.    Disbursement freeze. From December 2008 to May 2011, project’s disbursements were
suspended due to military coup in the country on December 23, 2008.

26.     Closing date was extended twice. On November 15, 2007 the project closing date was
extended from September 30, 2008 to December 31, 2009 and retroactively on January 30, 2011
to June 30, 2013 following IDA’s reengagement with GOG under Bank’s Operational
Policy/Bank Procedure (OP/BP) 7.30. These extensions were necessary to give more time for the
implementation of the project following its suspension of about two and half years. The project
was also restructured to revise the scope of project components in light of cost overruns, and in
order to maximize the project’s impact without changing the PDOs.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

27.    The project drew relevant lessons from past experience. The PAD highlighted the
importance of sustainable maintenance system for rural infrastructure and put an emphasis on
road maintenance system, road fund viability and ownership of infrastructure by local
beneficiaries. The labor intensive approach was viewed as a well suited tool for the sustainable
maintenance of lower level networks to ensure all-weather accessibility.




3
  The dispute led the Government of Guinea (GOG) to decide to modify the mandate of the two Ministries. Ministry
of Agriculture was designated as responsible, inter alia, for elaboration and implementation of the Borrower's rural
roads policy, including preparation and execution of investment and management programs for rural, regional, and
prefectural roads and of annual rural road maintenance programs; Ministry of Public Works was designated as
responsible, inter alia, for elaboration and implementation of the Borrower's national roads policy, including
preparation and execution of investment and management programs for national and urban roads and of annual
national road maintenance programs, and development of a national road map;




                                                         7
28.    Soundness of the project’s concept. The project had relevant development objectives.
The project design, scope and components had a strong analytical basis to respond to the key
challenges of the rural populations and rural development. The design kept a number of
components (three technical components) at a manageable level.

29.     The proposed activities were clearly linked to the project’s objectives and to GOG’s
priorities. The project design supported GOG’s plans to establish a critical mass of minimum
social and economic facilities in high need areas to better spin-off poverty reduction and
economic growth benefits. This was all the more relevant since the rural sector suffered from a
serious lack of investment and maintenance of basic infrastructure. Therefore, the Bank’s
decision to support the GOG in that regard was invaluable and responded to the most urgent
needs of the country.

30.    The decision to construct pilot logistics platforms was sound, as the lack thereof was a
key missing element in the agricultural value chain in Guinea, which was plagued with large
post-harvest losses and poor marketing prospects.

31.     The emergency rehabilitation of infrastructure was most needed to mitigate the spillover
effects of wars in neighboring countries and internal insurgency activity, which had put increased
strain on the limited facilities and led to the destruction or abandonment of many public
buildings in rural areas. Furthermore, the labor-intensive (“Haute Intensité de Main d’Oeuvre,
HIMO”) approach for the improvement of lower level rural roads was sound as it would provide
opportunities for jobless youths on one hand, and on the other hand it was in line with the level
of investment required to achieve basic all-season access.

32.     Quality at entry. Inadequate attention was paid during preparation to the implementation
capacity risk of DNPR, especially given the instable institutional set-up for the rural roads sub-
sector. In fact, during preparation it was assumed that DNPR had adequate technical and
fiduciary capacity since its key staff came from the PACV and the first Rural Infrastructure
Project (PNIR1) implemented by the National Directorate of Rural Engineering (Direction
Nationale du Genie Rural, DNGR) and supported by the World Bank.

33.      Furthermore, measures to mitigate the negative findings of the 2002 Country
Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) do not seem to have been addressed during preparation
and early phases of implementation. The CPAR established that the national procurement system
was not transparent and lacked economy and credibility, in particular due to weaknesses of
institutional capacity and procurement monitoring and supervision as well as the absence of anti-
corruption measures. One of the impacts of this was delayed project implementation and low
disbursements during the first phase of project implementation.

34.     Finally, taking the complex socio-economic-political context of Guinea at the time of
project preparation, the costs of the planned works seemed to be under-estimated which lead to a
reduction in the overall project scope and activities.

35.    Identification of project risks at preparation. Project preparation adequately identified
the key project risks, most of which did materialize during project implementation, more

                                                8
specifically: (i) the political instability context of Guinea which could affect the implementation
of the project; (ii) the institutional instability of the rural sector and the difficult relationship
between the MPW and the MA, and (iii) the risk associated with the collection of funds for road
maintenance. However, the impact that the country’s political instability had on the capacity of
private contractors to deliver works on time and with the required quality was inadequately
assessed. The risk was not clearly listed but contracts packaging strategy was suggested to tailor
contracts to the private sector capacity. This risk had materialized during implementation (see
paragraph 40).

36.     The project is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory in terms of quality at entry primarily
due to: (i) failure to better assert the critical nature of DNPR’s capacity deficiencies; (ii) lack of
putting in place mitigation measures in the project to address the weak country procurement
framework; and (iii) weak cost estimation of works; and (iv) inadequate project implementation
readiness. Furthermore, the fact that the project attempted too many innovations (road fund
reform, service level approaches, and labor-based techniques) at once seems a bit overambitious
given the context of instability and the difficult political economy of the country.

2.2 Implementation

37.    The implementation of the project has been broken down into two key periods.

(a) From effectiveness in October 2005 until suspension of disbursements in December
    2008.

38.     Implementation was initially delayed. Effectiveness which was initially scheduled for
January 2005 was delayed until October 2005 mainly due to the fact that the institutional set-up
was not ready. Indeed, there was a major change in implementation arrangement shortly after
Board approval (see paragraph 23 and 24 above). This change not only delayed effectiveness, but
it diverted most of the World Bank team’s effort towards nontechnical issues of helping the
GOG resolve the institutional dispute between the MA and the MPW.

39.    Another consequence of the institutional struggle between MA and MPW (see paragraph
23 above) was the late appointment of the Project Coordinator which only occurred in April
2006, a delay of more than one and a half years. The net effect of all this was the fact that first
year works program started only in early 2007, almost two and half years after the project was
approved. This led to a low disbursement rate of 17 percent in 2008 after two and half years of
implementation.

40.     Implementation was also initially hampered by the low capacity of the DNPR in terms of
procurement, and contract management. The quality of documents submitted to IDA was often
weak and DNPR did not systematically follow up on ongoing contracts. For instance, the GOG
took more than three years to cancel a contract for which the lack of performance by the
contractor involved was noted at the onset of the project. The project provided capacity building
to DNPR and project staff to allow them to better manage their tasks.

41.    The packaging and scope of International Competitive Bidding (ICB) contracts for rural
roads were well beyond the capacity of the local contractors which won the bids. This means that
                                                  9
not enough due-diligence was performed to ensure that eligibility criteria were adequate and that
local contractors were selected for works that they could deliver. Consequently, nearly 130
kilometers of awarded rehabilitation works were cancelled as a result of the contractor’s lack of
performance.

42.     By 2008, unit costs of road construction, in Guinea had recorded a 40 percent increase
since the time of appraisal in 2004. It was due to a sharp increase in fuel prices, following the
increase in crude oil prices, from an average of US$30 per barrel in 2004, to over US$100 per
barrel in 2006/2007; and for other critical construction inputs such as cement, bitumen, diesel,
etc.

43.     The World Bank conducted a Mid-Term Review (MTR) of the project in April 2008
where it was assessed that the following outputs were achieved: (i) the improvement of 152 km
of prefectural roads using conventional contracting out of the 920 km planned; (ii) the
maintenance of 194 km (out of 350 km) of prefectural roads and 2 small bridges (30 meters)
using labor-intensive methods; (iii) the completion of the technical studies and bidding
documents for the construction of six bridges; and (iv) the rehabilitation and equipment of 37
war-affected public buildings. Therefore, implementation and progress toward achievement of
PDOs were noted as Moderately Satisfactory in spite of the low disbursement rate of 17 percent
and the inefficient procurement and contract management by DNPR. Furthermore, at MTR, the
project’s funding gap was estimated at US$12.0 million as a result of the sharp increase in unit
cost for civil works (see paragraph 41 above) and the initial delay in project start. As a result of
this, some of the project activities were cancelled and an action plan was adopted to complete the
remaining activities that were deemed critical for the attainment of PDO. However, no particular
action was envisaged to deal with the underperforming road fund which fell way below the
financial targets agreed at appraisal (see paragraph 59 below).

44.     Suspension of project activities due to political instability. Shortly after MTR, due to
political instability4 IDA disbursements were suspended between December 2008 and April 2011
(total of 32 months). Project activities were frozen, except for the works of the Timbi-Madina
Logistics Platform (TMLP) for which: (i) Bank’s clearance of the contract was secured before
the suspension; and (ii) a pre-financing agreement was reached between the government and the
contractor.

(b) From retroactive extension of project closing date to project closing on June 30, 2013

45.    In early 2011, shortly after the lifting of suspension of World Bank operations in Guinea,
the project team carried out a reengagement mission, who enabled the retroactive extension of


4
  Political disturbance continued to affect PNIR2 until the project’s closing in June 2013. After project reactivation
in 2011 the country’s political situation remained volatile and difficult, characterized by frequent demonstrations
and tensions among key political players in the context of the legislative elections. During those frequent events, the
administration, including the entities involved in PNIR2, was paralyzed for days.




                                                         10
the project’s closing date from December 31, 2009 to June 30, 2013. It also paved the way for
the implementation of the measures sought during MTR to align the project’s scope with the
available resources (See table 2 above). Furthermore, the labor-intensive civil works component
was scaled up to maximize the job creation impacts of the project, given the high unemployment
context in rural areas after two years of strife. The effected changes were formalized in the June
2011 project restructuring.

46.    During the last two years of project implementation, DNPR’s capacity significantly
improved thanks to procurement training of project staff and the close technical assistance of the
bank team with regards to contract management issues. This has allowed the finalization of the
works of the 3 bridges, and the successful implementation of the labor-intensive civil works.

47.     The institutional dispute between MA and MPW briefly resurfaced in 2011, and
threatened to compromise the restart of project activities. This was due to institutional ambiguity
linked to the creation of a National Directorate of Prefectural Roads within MPW. GOG quickly
clarified the issue and confirmed that project was to continue to be implemented by DNPR.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

48.     M&E Design and Implementation. The selected outcome indicators were reasonable in
number and easy to measure. They were clearly linked to the three investment components of the
project and their collection was the responsibility of DNPR. Following the reduction in project
scope, the target values of the indicators were revised. Also, the World Bank core sector
indicators were added to the results framework (see paragraph F of data sheet).

49.     M&E Utilization. Great efforts were committed to measure and monitor the indicators,
and data were collected for most indicators. Difficulties were encountered in the measurement of
the core sector indicators which were added in the 2011 restructuring, more specifically, the
Rural Accessibility Index (RAI), and the share of the network in good or fair condition. This was
because of the complex methodology on one hand, and the lack of reliable road condition data on
the other hand. Nevertheless, conservative estimates were provided.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

50.      The Environmental safeguards classification for the project was A. Two safeguard
policies were triggered, but effects were limited to their impact and were technically and
institutionally manageable. The main safeguards issue was the preparation of Environmental
Assessment reports (EA) in compliance with OP 4.01. EA’s reports included a Strategic
Environmental Assessment and a Social Impact Analysis carried out in 2001/2002 as well as a
recent Environmental Assessment, which primarily focused on project interventions scheduled
for the first year. Specific project interventions for subsequent years, which were not known at
that time, were to be assessed prior to their implementation. Implementation of the
Environmental and Social Management Plans is Satisfactory.

51.     Furthermore, an Environment Unit was established in DNPR and its responsibilities were
clearly defined regarding the implementation of the Environment Social Management Plan


                                                11
(ESMP). DNPR regional and prefectural offices handled compliance with safeguards, including
assurance that contracts would cover environmental protection measures.

52.     Procurement. Overall procurement performance under the project was Unsatisfactory.
The weak procurement capacity at the start of the project contributed to the initial delays in
execution of project activities. Poor preparation of bid documents, lack of training, and weak
contract management capacity were the main issues that hampered project implementation (see.
paragraphs 40 and 41 above). However, strengthening the capacity of staff of DNPR, through
intensive training programs for works and consultant services helped raise procurement
performance significantly by the time of project closing.

53.     Financial management. Financial management by the DNPR was efficient. The
quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) were received regularly and were fully
compliant with the agreed format. Audits were done annually, on-time, and were unqualified.
The capacity building assistance provided under the project has contributed to this good
performance.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

54.     The GOG has openly expressed its satisfaction of the project’s results in spite of the
difficulties encountered during implementation and the reduction in scope (cf. annex 2). Also,
the communities at the decentralized level have unanimously praised the project’s impacts in
term of opening up rural zones and are expecting a follow up operation on rural roads and
economic infrastructures. The communities which were left out by the project as a result of the
scaled down activities are expecting GOG and World Bank’s support to deliver the initially
planned infrastructure (roads, bridges, and commercial platform).

55.     The 2013 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) did not propose a follow-on operation to
consolidate the impacts of the project. Nevertheless, the CPS will pursue the promotion of
commercial agriculture and the improvement of rural services. It is also likely that the FER is
included as a trigger of IDA budget support to GOG in view of improving its resources base and
its functioning.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

56.      The PDO remains relevant. The objective of providing improved basic rural
infrastructure and management systems remains a key priority for Guinea given the poor state of
the rural road network and the absence of rural infrastructure in general. The GOG remains
committed to increase the competitiveness of the agricultural sector by promoting export-led
initiatives. All of the above is included in the GOG’s 2013–2015 PRSP-3; which also
emphasizes the need to improve access to basic social services. Although there was a
restructuring on 2008, the PDO remained the same.




                                              12
57.     The challenges and activities identified at the project design remain relevant in the
current context of the country. The institutional arrangement for implementation and the
technical design of the project have been relevant given the country context at the project
preparation even though the readiness should have been more ensured before the effectiveness of
the project by solving DNPR mapping issue at an earlier stage of the project preparation process.
The procurement documents late preparations were not relevant. It should have been better to
start procurement process at an earlier stage and solve capacity challenge of implementing
agencies and project staff in a context of general difficult political environment of the country.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

58.    The PDO rating is Moderately Unsatisfactory for the following reasons.

59.      Although the revised output targets during the project restructuring of 2011 were
substantially achieved, the initial expected output targets were not. More specifically, only
800 kilometers of prefectural roads (63 percent of initial target) were rehabilitated, 3 rural
bridges (50 percent of initial target) constructed, and one commercial platform (50 percent of
initial target) was constructed. This means that project was unable to reach a large number of
initially targeted rural dwellers (around 500,000 not covered out of the planned 800,000) that
were expecting a substantial improvement in their livelihood as a result of the project.
Furthermore, the annual prefectural road maintenance program which was to complement project
intervention did not materialize as shown in table 4 below.

                            Table 3: Investment components results

60.      At project closing, there is no sustainable rural infrastructure maintenance and
management system. The Government had established a Road Maintenance Fund (FER),
through which direct financing for road maintenance was supposed to be ensured. The project
was designed on the premise that IDA funds would rehabilitate prefectural roads while the FER
had to provide funds for roads maintenance. There was a rural road sector strategy for service
level based network management and maintenance. The combination of this strategy and the
institutional framework and Road Maintenance Fund resources should have provided a solid
foundation for addressing the PRSP’s goal of reducing physical isolation for the rural population.
However, during the project implementation, the road fund failed to mobilize funds, the designed
strategy did not work properly, and resources of FER were not scaled up to a level that would
cover the routine maintenance needs of the network. Even though 18 percent of the FER funds
were earmarked for prefectural roads, the corresponding amount (US$3.6 million) was barely
                                                  13
sufficient to maintain about 1,000 kilometers of roads annually, which represents less than 8
percent of the prefectural road network. Furthermore, the capacity of the DNPR to adequately
program rural roads maintenance works remains weak with inadequate knowledge of the
network and no effective maintenance management tools in place.

61.     What follows is a detailed assessment of the project’s achievements against its specific
objectives.

62.     Objective 1: Provide improved basic infrastructure to rural populations in targeted areas.
The rating is Moderately Satisfactory for the following reasons:

      The prefectural road improvement program financed by the project has successfully
       delivered about 350 kilometers of improved roads (38 percent of target), providing all-
       season access to about 300,000 rural dwellers. However, in terms of coverage, the
       program fell substantially short of its initial target of maintaining 920 km of roads. This
       means that 500,000 rural dwellers failed to reap the direct benefits of improved access to
       the road network.

      The three rural bridges of Kaback, Téné, and Madina Oula were critical to connect
       remote rural areas with high agricultural production potential. Before the construction of
       the bridges the rural population had to cross the rivers either using old and unreliable
       ferries for the case of Kaback, or simply by foot in extremely unsafe conditions. The fact
       that project finally delivered the three bridges is a major achievement with positive socio-
       economic impacts (see paragraphs 66 and 67 below). Furthermore, about 8,000 hectares
       of high potential agricultural land were opened up and connected to the road network
       after the construction of the three bridges. In addition, remote areas which were once
       more connected to neighboring Sierra-Leone have now access to their regional centers
       thanks to the project. However, due to budget constraints (see paragraph 41 above); the
       project cancelled the construction of three other initially planned critical bridges.

      The labor intensive road maintenance program delivered beyond expectations. One
       hundred additional kilometers of roads were maintained, bringing the cumulative length
       of road maintained to 450 km. The quality of works was good and the program has

                                               14
       created 4,800 temporary jobs for youths. Furthermore, 108 small enterprises benefitted
       from the labor intensive road maintenance program, out of which 16 were owned by
       women. In terms of accessibility, the labor intensive road maintenance program has
       provided improved all-season access to 27 CRDs.

      The rehabilitation of war-affected public buildings was fully implemented. The restored
       buildings were reopened in 2008 shortly after the end of works and functional. This
       meant that by 2008, about 500,000 rural dwellers had access to restored basic
       infrastructure services such as health and education. Population of these areas had
       testified that the restored infrastructures improved their living condition.

      The TMLP was constructed and fully equipped by the project. It is now operational and it
       is managed by the Fouta Djalon Farmer Federation (Fédération des Paysans du Fouta
       Djallon FPFD). FPFD is a credible PO with significant technical and managerial
       capacity which was further strengthened by the project. Furthermore, the project has
       enhanced the storage and transport of potatoes to the TMLP. Indeed, 10 transit storage
       warehouses were constructed in the influence area of the platform while DNPR has
       improved a network of 122 km of rural roads in the same area. This has meant that in
       2012, the total value of potatoes that have passed through TMLP was estimated at
       US$607,000, compared to a revised target of US$500,000 (121 percent achievement) and
       an initial target of 1,000,000 (60,7 percent). This corresponds to about 1,032 tons of
       potatoes.

      Preliminary data indicates that potato post-harvest losses have fallen by 10 percent in
       2012 in the area covered by the federation (FPFD). Furthermore, the business plan of the
       platform indicates that the financial break-even point will be reached around 2020, date
       after which the platform will start generating profits. This means that the Federation will
       partly finance the functioning of the platform until that date.

63.    Objective 2: Provide sustainable infrastructure management and maintenance systems to
rural populations in targeted areas. The rating is Moderately Unsatisfactory for the following
reasons.

      During project implementation, FER was unable to progressively increase its funding
       (see table 5 below) through gradual increases in the road user fee. The annual budget of
       the road fund, which was estimated at US$20 million, covered only about a third of the
       paved network’s needs in terms of routine maintenance. Eighteen percent of that amount
       (about US$3.6 million) was earmarked for the maintenance of the 23,000 kilometers of
       rural network, i.e. US$150 per kilometer. This is grossly insufficient to sustain the rural
       road asset base.

      The study for the establishment of the rural roads database was completed. However, due
       to project’s closing, the project could not finance follow up technical assistance for the
       installation of the database. Until the rural roads database is installed, programming of
       rural road maintenance would continue to be subjective in the absence of consolidated
       knowledge of network condition.

                                               15
      The project has developed SME’s capacity in labor-intensive road maintenance. The
       trained labor force (mainly youth) is expected to remain and eventually participate in
       future maintenance works. Several SMEs were hired for the roads works and constitute a
       good asset for a strategy of routine maintenance through labor intensive methods.
       However, the SMEs capacity developed under the project may not be sustained unless a
       viable maintenance system is put in place with and adequate maintenance funding.

      FPFD as a rural professional organization was strengthened by the project through the
       technical assistance provided by CAFEX and the training of two staffs in the management
       of commercial infrastructure. FPFD has now the tools and the effective responsibilities in
       managing and maintaining the TMLP and using it as a stepping stone to effective market
       linkage.

3.3 Efficiency

64.     The measured cost of works per kilometer increased substantially compared to prices in
2004. This is attributed primarily to: (i) delays in the start of the road works; (ii) spike in oil
prices; (iii) lack of competition in the road construction sector in Guinea; (iv) political instability
in Guinea and (v) some weaknesses of cost estimates during project preparation;. The increased
cost of road maintenance and rehabilitation works during the period was not unique to Guinea,
but common throughout Sub-Saharan Africa. The achieved activities had a positive effect on the
lives of rural populations. Although the original project objectives have not been fully achieved,
the implementation of the project activities that were implemented has had a significant and
positive impact on the living conditions of targeted population.

65.     Some of the revised outcomes were achieved such as the rehabilitation on an emergency
basis of rural infrastructure in war affected areas, the platform of Timbi madina and the 3 bridges.
These achievements provided better access to rural populations to their prefecture capital
allowing them to more effectively sell agricultural products, and access basic social
infrastructure (health centers, education centers and public administration). Moreover, Labor
Intensive Approach (HIMO) has been developed through rehabilitation of the 450 km rural
roads which have provided jobs and contributed in income generation to the population living in
that area.

66.     Economic analysis. At appraisal, no ex-ante economic evaluation had been calculated
for the rural road investments, making it impossible to calculate an ex-post economic analysis of
the same. This is why, at completion, the best alternative to an economic analysis is a socio-
economic impact analysis to measure the benefits for local communities and farmers in the area
of influence of the project.

67.     With the construction of the 3 major bridges (Kaback, Madina Oula, and Tèné), the
labor-intensive maintenance of 450 kilometers including many small bridges/culverts, and the
improvement of 350 kilometers of prefectural roads, the project helped connect 38 rural districts
with all-season access roads. It covered an area of influence where more than 300,000 people
have seen their mobility improve significantly giving them increased access to health,
employment, education and other social services. In terms of efficiency, the project was designed
                                                  16
to rehabilitate 1270 km of prefectural roads (using conventional and labor intensive methods) at
a unit cost of US$12,500. However, due to implementation delays and cost overruns, only 800
km of roads were constructed at an estimated unit cost of US$17, 000 meaning a 35 percent
increase in costs compared to the initial cost estimates. The higher than expected costs in the
rural road works significantly reduced the number of people reached (300,000 instead of
800,000) by the project.

68.     Although they have not been quantified, the benefits resulting from connecting
agricultural production zones were substantial, both in terms of product distribution and financial
revenues. The construction of the 3 bridges at Kaback, Madina-Oula, and Tèné has allowed the
shipping of agricultural inputs to areas that were inaccessible in the past. Furthermore, the
emergence of local markets after the construction of the bridges would allow selling products at
a higher farmer’s price because improved accessibility generates more competition among
collectors and increased demand. This is especially the case for the area of influence of the
Kaback Bridge. See below table 5 and 6 on traffic and cost/benefits of constructing the Kaback,
Madina-Oual and Tene bridges:

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory.

69.     Although the project had a positive impact on all-weather accessibility in targeted areas,
its contribution to improving the condition of the overall rural road network (23,000 km) is
marginal. As of today, about 31 percent of the rural road network is in good or fair condition
compared to an estimated baseline value of 28 percent. This is mainly because of the following
factors: (i) the annual maintenance works under the FER only covered a small portion of the
network (less than 2 percent); and (ii) the project fell significantly short of its initial target of
improving 920 km of prefectural rural roads.

70.     Furthermore, the project was unable to lay a strong foundation for the management and
sustainability of rural infrastructure. The sustainable maintenance approaches introduced by the
project (labor intensive maintenance methods) and the local capacity created cannot be sustained
in the absence of predictable financing and programming of road maintenance.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

a. Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

71.     Improved access to health services. The construction of the 3 bridges has significantly
improved access of targeted populations to health centers. In fact, compared to 2011, the average
number of daily visits to health centers in the project influence area of the 3 bridges has
increased from 2 to 5 times. In the case of Kaback and Madina Oula, shortly after the
construction of the bridges, the local health centers were equipped with “motorbike ambulances”
to evacuate patients from remote areas. More specifically, the trip to the nearest health centers
using the ambulances takes on average about one hour from the most remote areas compared to 3
days before the construction of the bridges. Furthermore, the supply of pharmaceutical products
to villages and health centers in the area is now more regular and reliable thanks to the improved
accessibility of the local districts in the influence area of the bridges. The frequency of hygiene
and children health awareness campaigns in the project area has increased from 2 campaigns in
2011 to 5 campaigns in 2013.

72.     Improved access to education. Following the construction of the 3 bridges, primary
education enrollment has gone up on average by 15 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 in the
local districts of Koroumaninka (influence area of Téné Bridge), Bantanko, and Kaback.
Furthermore, in Kaback, the number of academic inspection audits from the Ministry of
Education has significantly increased from one visit per year to 6 visits in 2013. In Madina Oula,
the number of academic audits has increased from one every two years before the construction of
the bridge to 4 visits in 2013. The purpose of the academic audits is to improve the quality of
education and strengthen the capacity of teachers in local schools.

b. Institutional Change/Strengthening
NA

c. Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

73.     Before the construction of the three bridges, local populations reported an average of five
losses of life during the rainy season due to unsafe river crossing conditions. This is no longer
the case in Kaback, Téné and Madina Oula bridge influence areas.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
NA

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: High

74.    The sustainability of the project’s outcome is unlikely due to the weak performance of the
FER. Unless strong measures are taken by the GOG to scale up the resources of the FER,
improve its functioning, and rationalize its interventions, the project’s investments in the
prefectural network will not be adequately sustained.



                                                19
75.    The success of the TMLP will depend on sustained support to the FPFD and close
follow-up of the performances of the platform by CAFEX. Furthermore, facilitation measures
will be needed to assist the FPFD in the exportation of its production. The performance of the
TMLP will also depend on the quality of the road network in its area of influence to allow for the
transport of produce in a cost-efficient and reliable manner.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

76.     The technical preparation was adequate and of acceptable quality. However it
overestimated the capacity on the ground to implement relatively complex and demanding
project. Furthermore, it did not adequately estimate the cost of the works and the project had low
readiness for implementation. The net result of these factors (overestimation of implementation
capacity of implementing agency, low readiness for implementation and inadequate cost
estimates of works) is that project implementation was initially very slow and the outputs
supported by the project had to be reduced in both scope and size.

77.     The project did not have enough leverage to push though sensitive reforms such as the
establishment of a second generation road fund endowed with enough user fees to finance
maintenance of the road network. This reform should have been more closely linked with the
World Bank budget support programs and also through a closer coordination with other donors,
especially the European Union.

78.   The project did introduce some innovation in the roads subsector such as spot
improvements and high intensity labor maintenance methods which were most relevant to the
Guinea context. However, their long term sustainability is inadequate.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

79.      The overall actions taken by the World Bank were appropriate and adequate to
implement the project taking into account the difficult Guinea context. In addition, although with
some delay, the project team was instrumental in resolving key project implementation issues.
This is especially after the disbursements resumed and the project was restructured. Moreover,
while the Task Team focused on making the project “effective”, it should have done more on
ensuring implementation readiness. This is especially the case with the tardy preparation of the
first year’s works program. Similarly more could have been done towards strengthening
institutional capacity to more effectively implement the project. Furthermore, although
interaction between the headquarters based task team leaders and field staff was good, and the
field staff was fully empowered to deal with the daily supervision activities, the field staff could
have been more effective if there was a clearer supervision strategy due to the status of the
project as “problem project”.

                                                20
80.      Finally, the project team was effective in ensuring that project was restructured and
activities restarted after the lifting of the disbursement suspension in January 2011. This enabled
critical activities, like the 3 bridges, to be completed before the extended project closing date.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

81.     Although project preparation should have been more thorough in identifying institutional
bottlenecks to implementation, ensuring a higher degree of implementation readiness and more
adequate cost estimates, the political environment prevailing in the country during preparation
and implementation was complex and played a pullback role. For example, there was inadequate
attention and/or capacity by GOG to adequately address key early implementation issues such as
making the project effective and to quickly modify the institutional set up to implement the
project or undertaking the first procurement process while waiting for effectiveness. These two
issues were only resolved by the proactive intervention of the World Bank.

82.     Furthermore, once project implementation got under way, the World Bank was proactive
in working with the GOG to implement the project during a difficult period for Guinea, which
included a long suspension of project activities. This means despite the difficult environment
that the project faced especially during implementation, thanks to the proactive effort by the
World Bank and project team, the project was still able to achieve part of the key project
objectives.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

83.    Although, GOG had a clear vision for responding to the needs of the rural population in
terms of improved infrastructure, the delays in project’s effectiveness and in appointing the
project coordinator indicate that it lacked commitment to the project during its earlier
implementation stages. In addition, the institutional struggle between the MPW and MA who
should implement the project had a negative impact on the early implementation of the project.
Furthermore, despite earlier commitments, GOG was not able to increase the resources of the
FER which in the long run will undermine the sustainability of the project investments. Finally,
MA took several years to cancel an underperforming contract due to the fact that some of the
systemic procurement issues identified early in the project life were not adequately addressed.
However, towards the end of the project GOG’s implementation performance improved
marginally. This allowed the construction of the three bridges and the Timbi Madina Platform.

84.     However, during the final years of project implementation, the GOG displayed
significantly more commitment to the project.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory



                                                21
85.    Project implementation was negatively impacted by the long and heavy administrative
procedures, long procurement delays and poor capacity of contractors. The works execution had
suffered from lack of close supervision of implementing agencies leading to long delay in works
delivery. The weak capacity of the implementing agencies (see paragraph 40) and consequently
the poor supervision of the project activities, had led to late contract cancellation and its negative
impact on the scope of road length executed (nearly 130 kilometers of awarded rehabilitation
works were cancelled as a result of the contractor’s lack of performance). This situation was
worsened by the institutional instability of the project implementing agency and the lack of
motivation and instability of staff working for the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

86.      The performance of the GOG and implementing agencies is Moderately Unsatisfactory.
First, the borrower should have taken proactive decision to quickly solve the issue of institutional
arrangement during the project preparation. This led to a long delay in making the project
effective, having the project in place and starting the project execution. Second, the borrower had
poorly supervised the project activities leading to delays in completing works. Furthermore, the
borrower took three years to cancel a contract of works despite the recommendation to do so
during the project supervision missions. Third, the borrower did not do enough in increasing the
resources and improve the functioning of the FER. After project restructuring, the
implementation agency tried to reduce the implementation delays. With the support of the World
Bank, project team substantive efforts allowed the achievement of some revised targeted
activities (the platform of Timbi-Madina and the 3 bridges). In addition, the entire planned post-
civil strife areas emergency rehabilitation activities were implemented.

6. Lessons Learned

87.    Ownership of project activities. The labor intensive maintenance components had
strong ownership by project beneficiaries and the targeted length was entirely executed. This is
because the beneficiaries of this particular component and local contractors worked together to
ensure the implementation of labor intensive maintenance works.

88.      Clearer institutional framework. A well-functioning institutional arrangement for the
project is a critical factor to ensure implementation success. In the case of the project, this risk
should have been mitigated as part of the preparation process, even if it would have resulted in a
delay in project approval. As the project implementation unit is key to project implementation,
earlier training program should have been put in place for project key staff.


89.     Mainstreaming of project implementation. When the conditions are met, project
implementation can be mainstreamed within the relevant ministries. This is because it can have a
positive impact in term of capacity building but can slow down project implementation if there is
not a proper incentive framework. For example the lack of incentives of staff working for the
project was one of the reasons for slow project implementation. Thus, wherever possible, for
next operation with mainstreamed in public administration, incentives should be negotiated for

                                                 22
staff involved in the project implementation during the project preparation and funds secured for
that.

90.     A good maintenance system is important to ensure the sustainability of roads/rural
roads. Rural roads require regular maintenance due to their high vulnerability to climatic factors
such as rains and quick degradation caused by heavy traffic. In the case of Guinea which is a
country with heavy rains and long period of rainy season, it is recommended to take into account
this constraint in the future design of road maintenance program. For such maintenance program,
the Road Funds should have financial, administrative, and regulatory autonomy (resources must
not be channeled through the Government’s budget).

91.    Introduction of spot improvement. The introduction of the spot improvement concept
on rural roads requires careful preparation/advocacy/planning for it to work properly due to a
tendency of road administration to do a full rehabilitation of roads. Furthermore, training and 1st
phase pilot program should be implemented to ensure ownership and good understanding of the
system before scaling up its implementation.

92.     Contractors’ capacities are a key element of project success. The project scope and
type (rural roads) required works to be executed by small contractors over a large geographic
area. For this to happen in better conditions, the capacities of the local SME contracting industry
should have been assessed and the works planned accordingly. In addition, the geographical
location of works should be a parameter for the package of contracts to facilitate implementation
by small contractors and follow up by administration and supervision firms.

93.     Project components/activities should be properly funded to achieve PDOs. The
project included an indicator on road maintenance while the project did not support this activity
directly since it did not provide funding to the Road Maintenance Fund. This means that there is
need for a careful selection of indicators and a need to ensure that sufficient leverage exists at the
project level for some indicators and even reforms.

Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      At appraisal, no ex-ante economic evaluation was calculated for the rural road
investments, making it impossible to calculate an ex-post economic analysis of the same. This is
why, at completion, the best alternative to an economic analysis is a socio-economic impact
analysis to measure the benefits for local communities and farmers in the area of influence of the
project.

2.       On one hand, with the construction of the 3 major bridges (Kaback, Madina Oula, and
Tèné), the labor-intensive maintenance of 450 kilometers including many small bridges/culverts,
the improvement of 350 kilometers of prefectural roads, the project helped connect 38 rural
districts with all-season access roads. It covered an area of influence where more than 300,000
people have seen their mobility improve significantly giving them increased access to health,
employment, education and other social services. In terms of efficiency, the project was designed
to rehabilitate 1270 km of prefectural roads (using conventional and labor intensive method) at a
unit cost of US$12,500. However, due to implementation delays and cost overruns, only 800 km
of roads were constructed at an estimated unit cost of US$17, 000 meaning a 35 percent increase
in costs compared to the initial cost estimates. The higher than expected costs in the rural road
works significantly reduced the number of people reached (300,000 instead of 800,000) by the
project.

3.      On another hand, although they have not been quantified, the benefits resulting from
connecting agricultural production zones were substantial, both in terms of product distribution
and financial revenues. The construction of the 3 bridges at Kaback, Madina-Oula, and Tèné has
allowed the shipping of agricultural inputs to areas that were inaccessible in the past.
Furthermore, the emergence of local markets after the construction of the bridges would allow
selling products at a higher farmer’s price because improved accessibility generates more
competition among collectors and increased demand. This is especially the case for the area of
influence of the Kaback Bridge.

4.     The TMLP construction and the technical assistance provided to FPFP, allowed
prolonged storage time for potatoes. The added value of the TMLP has increased by the
construction of 10 hauling stores for potatoes collection. The platform unit cost has increased
tremendously. It was initially planned to build 2 platforms at the unit cost of US$1.2 million.
However, only one platform was built at the cost of US$2 million. Moreover, in order for the
platform to be operational, number of unplanned, but necessary equipment had to be purchased.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

1. Objective of the Evaluation and Context

1.      The preparation and implementation of the Second National Rural Infrastructures
Program (Programme National des Infrastructures Rurales, PNIR2) coincided with a general
economic climate characterized by a substantial macroeconomic framework. Since 2001, the
financial and socio-economic situation of the country has been undergoing an irregular variation
in growth rate which moved from 3.8 percent in 2001 to 4.2 percent in 2002 before coming down
in 2013 to 1.2 percent and gradually increasing to 2.7 percent in 2004 and 3.3 percent in 2005.

2.      This shows a high instability of macroeconomic instability. On local level, the most
striking crises were shortage of water and electricity supplies, worsening of budget deficit which
approximates 5 percent from 2001 to 2004, inflationary pressures which affected national
economy particularly in 2005 where the higher rate level was reached (30.9 percent) further to
the increase of fuel cost.

3.      Another instable situation includes the Treasury’s debts vis à vis the Central Bank, the
marked falling-off in currency assets which moved (in terms of importation month number) from
2.7 percent in 2001 to 1.4 percent in 2004, the continuing depreciation of the national currency
which reached 24 percent in 2004 in comparison with US dollars and the permanent increase of
prices since 2003. On a year-on-year basis, the consumer price index moved from 6.1 percent in
2002 to 14.8 percent in 2003 and to 27.6 percent in 2004.

4.      These lapses in macroeconomic management brought out serious consequences on
mobilization of external funding and implementation of Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS)
policy.

5.      In order to reverse the trend, the Government adopted in January 2002, the PRS paper
which formed a reliable basis for the Government to promote economic development and
poverty reduction. Implementation of PRS however faced these last three years, various
difficulties related to the effects of sub regional instability, mobilization of external funding and
financial and economic management of the country.

6.     As far as food security in concerned, it is still an emergency situation: anthropometric
data about kids under 5, reveal that real nutrition issues do exist. According to QUIBB data, 11.2
percent (against 9 percent in 1999) of kids from this category in 2002-2003 contracted
emaciation (acute malnutrition). The situation remains of concern as far as adult population is
concerned.

7.      In order to reverse the trend, the Government adopted in January 2002, a PRS paper and
also issued in 2003 with FAO support, a national strategy for food security in compliance with
the results of diagnostic survey related to the nutrition and food situation of the country.




                                                 33
8.      It is in this general context that the Government gave precedence to the funding and
implementation of a Rural Infrastructures Program (PNIR2) which perfectly complies with the
objectives of national strategy for food security related to survey results about nutrition and food
situation in the country.

9.      As a reminder, this strategy aims at reducing in half underfed persons by 2015 and
particularly focused on (i) the emergence of a private agricultural sector, the development of
rural infrastructures, improvement of input supply conditions and the development of support
services to the benefit of rural population (research, outreach services etc…), (ii) improvement of
access to food products and farm workers’ skills development.

10.    Thus, the World Bank and Guinea agreed in October 2004 on a credit (amounted 30
million US Dollars) for funding PNIR2 project of an initial target period of 4 years. In this
regards, the credit agreement included funding participation to budget as far as the State
commitments are concerned.

11.    The Project was implemented by the Agriculture Ministry through the National
Directorate for Rural Roads (Direction Nationale des Pistes Rurales, DNPR), the National
department for rural roads operating as the implementing agency. DNPR entered into an
agreement with the Export Facilitation Center (Centre de Facilitation des Exportations CAFEX)
to implement the marketing and conservation pilot infrastructures component and the setting into
management of platforms. Thus, DPNR coordinates PNIR2 project activities including fiduciary
aspects, annual budgets consolidation; funds transfer operations and ordinary financial reporting.

12.    Apart from IDA support in PNIR2 project, the African Development Bank (ADB) and
the IDB funded, in the context of the improvement of some village roads on the prefectural and
community network, for PA/PNIR2 US$10,460 million (credit no. 6955GUI) and the IDB for the
SNCP, an amount of US$9,01 million (credit no. 2100150006955) respectively.

a. Objective and Design of the Project

13.   The PNIR2 project includes four components: component A: rural roads, component B:
emergency infrastructures, component C: conservation and marketing infrastructures and finally,
component D: coordination and management of the project.

14.    The overall objective of the PNIR2 is: (i) the improvement of access to production areas
by reducing of 25 percent the transport, (ii) the emergency rehabilitation of infrastructure in
areas affected by rebel incursions and the creation of jobs and (iii) the establishment of
conservation and commercialization infrastructures meant to improve the productivity and the
income of the producers.

15.    To reach this overall objective, 920 Km of prefectural roads have been renovated for an
easy access to areas of agricultural production in 20 prefectures, 350 km of slopes have been
renovated by LIPW method in 7 prefectures, 6 rural bridges have been constructed, 37 public
buildings have been constructed in communities affected by the war in 7 prefectures and 2
conservation and marketing infrastructures have been built.

                                                34
16.    Also through PNIR2, the Government should set up a coherent system of management
and sustainable maintenance of the entire network by providing a Road Maintenance Funds
(Fonds d’entretien routier, FER) that would help support rural roads maintenance works.

17.     The expected results of this project are as follows: (i) A regular access to capital
prefecture guaranteed for 70 CRD, that is over 800,000 inhabitants, (ii) improve access to basic
social services by the rehabilitation of public buildings for 23 CRD affected by rebels’ incursions
with job opportunities offer through roads construction by LIPW method (iii) and finally provide
targeted professional organizations with platform facilities to maintain and market local
production.

b. Evaluations

18.     For the purposes of monitoring and evaluating the project, the project was mid-term
evaluated, monitored with the Bank monitoring missions that led to the preparation of interim
reports. The current review is the final evaluation of the project that leads to the preparation of a
completion report which major objectives and application fields relate to the results of the
completed project, the effectiveness of the means used to implement the project and the
contribution of the project to development and its sustainability. In this perspective, a mission
was undertaken by the consultant to carry out an assessment of PNIR2 from its conception to the
closing step in order to write the completion report in compliance with the standards in force.

19.     The main objectives and the scope of the project completion report consist in evaluating
the results of the completed project, the effectiveness of the means used to implement the
project, as well as its contribution to development and its sustainability. This document is not
only a self-evaluation task, but also a source of lessons for the Bank and the borrower that could
help improve ongoing projects as well as future projects.

20.     Specifically, the mission aims at carrying out critical analyses of project implementation
with the assistance of the coordination unit. At each stage of the project cycle, the point is to
identify the strengths and weaknesses, learn lessons and make recommendations for future
programs and projects in the sector of rural infrastructure project between Guinea and the World
Bank.

2. Achievement of the objectives and results of the project

a. Project Implementation

21.     The credit agreement amounting to US$30,300 million was signed on 14 October 2004
under the No. 39720 with the World Bank to finance the second Rural Infrastructure National
Project (PNIR2).

22.    However the project underwent several changes during its implementation. During the
evaluation of the project, the Government's participation was set to US$4.2 million. During
execution, the country faced a macroeconomic imbalance as a result of the disturbances recorded
during the rebel attacks of 2000. This made it hard for the State to fulfill its contribution to the

                                                 35
financing of the project activities. Thus, the Government issued a request for amendment of the
credit agreement with the Bank’s Board of Directors so that IDA supports the entire project cost
(100 percent) instead of 85 percent as initially scheduled when signing the credit agreement. This
provision came into force in June 2008.

23.     The second major amendment related to reallocation of activities which negatively
influenced the achievement of the project’s initial objectives. Caused by fuel, construction
materials, and labor surge price as well as the suspension of project activities following the
political events in 2008, that relocation did negatively influence the achievement of the initial
objective. The available credit balance was consequently used for on-going activities before
funding discontinuation, as well as some new additional activities identified as priorities. That
reallocation resulted in: (i) the postponement of Kankan plat form construction. (ii) the
programming of three (3) major bridges instead of six (6) as initially planned; (iii) The reduction
of more than 50 percent of planned rural roads network. Other events and changes in the project
are summarized in the table below:

24.       The major constraints identified during the implementation include:

         On the administrative front: (i) long administrative procedures. (ii) long procurement
          cycle, (iii) lack of contractualization of key posts in the team project, (iv) Unstable
          project institutional framework and coordination team, (v) lack of motivation in positions,
          (vi) low capacity of the private sector (companies).

         On the technical front: (i) heavy allotment of 1st cycle works, (ii) poor performance of
          SMEs due to the lack of work equipment, lack and/or shortage in qualified support
          personnel for local SMEs and poor organization and mismanagement of construction
          sites and lack of financial support from the banking sector for contractual guarantees.

         On the financial front: (i) Very long implementation and effectiveness periods affecting
          the performance of the project, (ii) the instability of the cost of materials affecting
          expenses related to the management of contracts, (iii) and the reallocation of the project
          cost affecting specific objectives.

b. Project Objectives Evaluation

25.     During the formulation, a logical framework summarizing material elements and
objectives’ assessment was provided. The logical framework that has been implemented sets out
the objectives and performances with guidance on required quantification and measures. This
predisposition has been useful for the monitoring and evaluation of the achievement of the
project’s objectives.

26.     The evaluation revealed that set objectives are consistent and relevant in compliance with
the country's development priorities and achievable with regard to contributions to the project
and the expected time. Indeed, the formulation of the project aimed to provide a solution to the
need for opening up of production rural areas which is in close coherence with the PRSP
priorities and the objectives of the letter (LPDA II) which is specifically expected to provide
national food security. The objectives of the project are also consistent with the Bank’s
intervention policy on behalf of developing Member States; interventions which aim at
contributing to economic development that would help reduce poverty and with other donors’
interventions in the fields of opening up rural areas. Furthermore, based on consensus, specific
objectives have been optimally defined with all development actors.

27.     Moreover, the evaluation revealed that with lessons learned from the first experience of
the PNIR1, the improvement of production areas access by the opening-up, the improvement of
basic infrastructure access and the increase of revenues are easily achievable. However the
renovation of conservation and marketing infrastructures thanks to pilot experience could make it
hard to implement the project. Its realization was made easy thanks to the participatory approach
and the acquisition of a consensus from stakeholders on the objectives of the project.

c. Results Evaluation and performance of the project

28.       Overall assessment. In terms of results, the project provided the following:

                                                  37
      Components A: Rural roads

       -   Markets National tenders: 151 km rural roads renovated,
       -   Markets International tenders: 235.400 km including 98 km received and 137.4
           terminated,
       -   The construction of 336ml of Rural bridges in the prefectures of Dalaba-Kindia-
           Forecariah,
       -   The construction of the Tene Bridge (length 100 m) in the rural community of Mafara
           - Dalaba Prefecture, and
       -   The construction of the Kaback Bridge (length 100 m) in the rural community of
           Forécariah Kaback Prefecture.

29.    LIPWs: 450 km of rural roads. With the labor intensive work, the achievement rate is as
follows:
       - 350 km of rural roads have been rehabilitated, 100 km are running, 213 ml built
          crossing structures and 70 ml of crossings running; and
       - 108 companies involved include 16 women's businesses with 4800 jobs created,
          106421 served populations and 22 CRD covered.

      Component B Emergency Infrastructures. 36 buildings have been rehabilitated and
       become operational. They include: 18 primary schools of 3 classes each, 12 offices for
       the District Administration, 3 positions in health sector, 2 village markets and 1
       Prefectural Section Office for rural roads.

      Conservation and marketing infrastructures. Construction of Timbi-Madina platform.

      Coordination and project management. Under the coordination of the project, the mid-
       term review has been carried out as well as the holding of three steering committees other
       than supervision and periodic and close monitoring missions executed on the ground.
       Accounts financial audits for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012 have been carried out. The
       establishment of database is in progress. The project team has benefited, in terms of the
       Bank's contribution, from several domestic and foreign training courses. This training
       was very beneficial and conducive to the project coordination effectiveness.

3. Performance of the Project

a. Overall performance of the project

30.      The results of this project did positively and substantially affect lives of population.
Indeed, although entire original objectives have not been achieved, the implementation of
activities has changed significantly and positively the living conditions of population targeted.
Project key outcomes in terms of results include: The works carried out under the PNIR2 helped
provide accessed rural areas by granting population with easy access to their prefecture capital
city with the guaranteed transport of a huge quantity of agricultural products. Access to social
basic infrastructures by populations affected by the rebel incursions of targeted areas was made

                                               38
possible due to emergency infrastructures renovated. Moreover, LIPWs developed through
rehabilitation of the 350 km rural roads, were an opportunity of jobs creation and thus income
generation to the benefit of population living that area.

31.     Moreover, the Government has set up a Road Maintenance Funds (FER) that would
directly support road maintenance. This FER under the project, annually assured maintenance
funding of one part of rural roads program presented by DNPR. The establishment by the
Government of this new institutional framework is meant to facilitate adequate support for the
entire road network is a secure and promising starting point to reduce systematically populations’
physical isolation as well as the difficult access to production areas.

32.     However it is necessary to note that the project failed to achieve the original and revised
objectives; which did impact performances. Indeed, despite the second restructuring of project
activities meant to provide efficiency, objectives set after revision of activities are still
unachieved.

33.      Furthermore, factors that negatively affect the performance and results of the project
include: substantial delays noted during project effectiveness and implementation of project
activities (October 2005 – June 2013, 7 years 9 months) with the virtual non-existence of
production during the period of credit freeze and suspension: December 2008-April 2011(ii) the
institutional instability within Ministries and DNPR and (iii) the ineffectiveness of the project
team’ motivation.

34.     In conclusion, we note that positive planned impacts from achieved results have been
eroded by counter-performances from delays in implementation, institutional instability and the
project team, of non-achievement of the initial objectives and the problems encountered during
project implementation. In consideration of the above, the performances of the project are
considered Moderately Unsatisfactory.

b. The Bank's performance

35.     The Bank’s participation in the financing of Guinea rural infrastructures is appropriate.
Credit granted by the Bank is, for the Government a valuable support in its policy for the
promotion of the national food security program in agricultural sector through the development
of rural infrastructures for a better access to rural production areas. Missions of the Bank during
the project entire cycle were an appropriate contribution. Assistance was also quite useful during
definition of objectives, activities, results expected and especially to the project team during
implementation. The deadlines for response to stakeholders’ loads were satisfactory for project
implementation. The Bank's performance is considered Satisfactory.

c. Performance of the Borrower

36.     The borrower has achieved results that positively impacted the populations through a
successful project preparation with a relevant definition of objectives for the economic
development of the country. It also succeeded in managing (i) negotiations and signature of the
credit; (ii) met the Bank’s general conditions required to project effectiveness. (iii) the adoption

                                                39
of the Project Implementation Manual, (iv) the establishment of a Project Coordination Team
and (v) the opening of an account for the project and payment of initial deposit to the concerned
account; (vi) the implementation of the project with the Bank’s collaboration and support.

37.     It is however necessary to note that the borrower showed substantial delay during project
implementation. This caused the postponement of completion date on two occasions (from
Moreover existence of a retrospective reactivation). Just for the only Credit Agreement
implementation, the State has virtually shown a year's delay for its effectiveness. Shortcomings
were also noted (i) on the institutional instability with many changes during project life cycle. (ii)
at project opening step, lack of mobilization of necessary resources in time for its contribution on
project activities financing. (iii) The unreached objectives revised despite restructuring of
activities.

38.    In consideration of the above, the borrower’s performance is rated Moderately
Unsatisfactory
.
d. Performance of the unit and the implementing agencies

39.    Executing agency (DNPR) led the project to achievement of the above listed - results.
Coordination helped achieve real beneficial outcomes for populations and contributed to the
achievement of the objective of rural roads opening-up initiated by the Government. The team
appropriately worked well with the World Bank’s Heads and the environmental and social
safeguard measures have been identified and implemented in a satisfactory manner.

40.     However despite the fact that the executing agency officials have provided much effort to
complete the project, coordination of the activities met several obstacles that did impact its
effectiveness. They include: (i) the motivation of the project team that was not effective, (ii) the
socio-political and economic situation in the country, (iii) many institutional changes occurred in
the team during project implementation. Furthermore, the project went through much delay
which in turn did affect the performance of the implementing agency.

41.    In consideration of the above, the performance of the coordination unit is generally
regarded as Moderately Satisfactory.

e. Performance in terms of Environmental protection is satisfactory

42.     A Program of Environmental and Social Management (PGES) was developed based on
the specificities of each site. In the whole, implementation of mitigation measures focus on the
entire environment elements (soil, water, air, vegetation cover...), with a particular emphasis on
the restoration of vegetation cover, monitoring of the balance of the environment as well as the
mitigation of impacts on the human and social environment.

43.    Implementation of the PGES activities focused on: (i) its validation by the Guinean
Office for Environmental Evaluation; (ii) its implementation by the company, the Control
Mission and supervision through the project coordination, (iii) the establishment of the follow-up



                                                 40
Committee composed of representatives of several ministerial departments by an administrative
act signed by the delegated Ministry responsible for Water and Forest Environment.

44.    An environmentalist was hired at each site level for PGES implementation and an inter-
ministerial Committee monitors through monthly supervision under the chairmanship of the
Guinean Office for Studies and Environmental Evaluations. The National Directorate for Rural
Roads did improve implementation based on advice and recommendations of the supervisory
missions. In consideration of the above, the environmental backup performance is Satisfactory.

4. Investments socio-economic and environmental impact

45.     The socio-economic impact of the project to the benefit of beneficiaries is certain. The
results of the project did significantly improve (i) conditions of accessibility of concerned rural
areas, the opening up of production areas for populations, (ii) development of the concerned rural
areas ( Example of Kabak: according the beneficiaries, a market for the sale of agricultural
products emerged following the construction of the road and the bridge); (iii) Producers’
incomes (with Pankaj Madina, the conservation of seeds and production platform is possible and
rot of potato losses will be eliminated; (iv) producers became more courageous and optimistic in
increasing growing areas because of the new flow conditions, production conservation and
marketing offered by the project;) (v) with the project’s new emergency infrastructures,
accessibility of the population to basic services (schools, medical, markets, areas of production,
etc.), and the connection between the villages, sub prefectures, departments or regions did
substantially improve, (vi) Fighting poverty in targeted areas through the construction under
LIPW, of 350 km by creating revenue opportunities for population living in that area.

a. Socio-economic impact of each component:

46.     Component A Rural Roads. A substantial improvement in access to concerned production
areas through the opening-up as well as a reduction of the cost of transportation has been reached
(significant improvement of service infrastructure level, journey times and risk for access to rural
areas significantly reduced, other more efficient transportation modes develop etc.) Populations
impacted positively by the project now have an easy access capital town prefecture.

47.     Component B Emergency Infrastructures. The renovation of emergency infrastructures in
areas affected by rebel incursions and job creation. The construction of these emergency
infrastructures was of a large contribution to economic and especially socially in the areas of
concern. Armed-affected and conflict-affected populations in the sub region (especially Sierra
Leone, Guinea Bissau, Liberia and recently in Côte d'Ivoire) since the mid-1990s, benefited from
basic social services, essential and critical to any human being’s life. For example, markets,
schools and health stations renovation did respectively contribute to creating revenues for
women, schooling kids and access to health care.

48.     The emergency rehabilitation program carried out through PNIR2 allowed a quick
restoration of basic infrastructure in most affected areas, which also facilitated the return of
displaced people, security establishment, and further help for PRSPs objectives achievement in



                                                41
these areas. Moreover, work Organization by LIPW method allowed generating income for the
conflict-affected populations of those areas of concern.

49.     Component C: conservation and marketing infrastructure. The implementation of these
infrastructure conservation and marketing in the example of that of Timbi-Medina has promoted
(i) a better involvement of local producers’ organizations and effective ownership of the works
by the people with a strong impact on women’s participation, (ii) an increase in productions with
the possibility of conservation areas offered by the project (30 to 40 percent of the lost
production are now recoverable with the platform); (iii) increased production with a notorious
decline of rot and especially for potato losses; (iv) promotes a new craze for producers to invest
more in potatoes cultivation; (v) a better organization of producers and an increase in the
creation of income and jobs for local people. The operation of the platform is going to be a
stabilizing element for social life of these populations by occupying the young who tended to
leave rural zones.

50.     Moreover, it is noteworthy that this pilot platform is a relevant example of development
and production poles in rural areas. This should serve as an example in other parts of the country
considering local speculation. Indeed, the platform has allowed increasing the volume of seed
from 300 to 500 tons between 2011 and 2012; 500-725 tons between 2012 and 2013 and
projection up to 1200 tons in 2013-2014. The development of the platform allowed also Timbi-
Madina producers’ Federation to install ten (10) young producers for the purposes of extension
of cultures boundaries. On average, each young man is expected to landscape 10 ha for the
extension. Women’s participation in this federation was also highly significant (approximately
64 percent of members are women).

51.     As a conclusion, restoration of these infrastructures comply with DSRP objectives for
rural sector which aims at providing: (i) an economic growth, (ii) a stimulation of the rural
economy, capitalizing on the emergence of local professional organizations, and potential
business partners to initiate effective link of farmers in the most profitable distribution channels,
and, (iii) in the long term facilitate their integration into supply chains for export to the
international and regional levels, (iv) strengthen the capacities of farmers’ organizations in the
management of quality logistics and marketing skills to ensure an adequate and continuous
supply while developing a contractual framework that would ensure the functioning and
sustainable maintenance of these facilities.

52.     Component D: Coordination and project management. With credit effectiveness
conditions, the Government recently set up a FER that would directly finance road maintenance.
Under the project, this fund annually provided funding for maintenance of PNIR2 program. It is
noteworthy that the total budget available for the project did not fully cover the service needs of
PNIR2. Initially, the transfer of rural roads responsibility was carried by the Department of
public works and transport, DNPR was created as the structure of this Ministry. Thus, DNPR was
put under the authority of the Ministry of Agriculture. The establishment by the Government of
this new institutional framework supporting the funding of management and maintenance of road
network strategy is a safe and promising starting point to reduce systematically the physical
isolation of both the populations and production areas.



                                                 42
53.    Establishment of a database of rural roads by DNPR. This activity will allow the
DNPR to have a good knowledge of the State of its rural roads network and have a
management and programming tool of its maintenance, renovation and extension works.
According to DNPR, the consultant in charge of database establishment started his activities
and the base is being gradually installed.

54.    In consideration of the above, the socio-economic impact of the project is a reality
given the results achieved with the project.

b. Sustainability of the results

55.      The involvement of the beneficiaries in the project implementation process and the
participatory approach adopted by the Government during the project entire cycle is a pledge for
the sustainability of the achieved results. Indeed, these arrangements since DRSP preparation
helped ensure (i) a good fit populations’ needs with the objectives and activities of the project;
(ii) an effective ownership of the project by populations; which constitutes liable and sustainable
element of the project expected results.

56.    Moreover, it is noteworthy that Guinea is currently working to facilitate an additional
economic situation that could favor further investments to be apportioned and managed so that
they contribute to the consolation of achieved results... Additionally, Guinea reached the
completion point of the HIPC initiative and an exploitation of this situation would constitute a
pledge for the extension of the sustainability of the project results impact on populations.

57.     Moreover, still in the perspective of results sustainability, the Government will have to
take the following measures: (i) better associate and involve local decentralized structures in
rural roads activities and populations to ensure ownership, (ii) the road maintenance fund should
be provided with sufficient and sustainable resources in order to cover the needs in maintenance
of rural roads. (iii) Also renovate prefectural roads that are an extension of the community roads
on the network, (iv) develop on the one hand standards and maintenance strategies by defining
roads tasks and unit costs in compliance with required standards and on the other hand, the
programming and maintenance of rural roads network to assure optimal control of maintenance
management.

5. Lessons learned

a. The most significant positive lessons

58.    Despite the fairly average overall level of the results recorded by PNIR2 project, positive
lessons have been identified such as:

59.     Guinean authorities are aware of the scopes of impacts that can bring the project to
economic development and its contribution to the fighting poverty. Indeed, the State has
demonstrated its willingness to complete the project by suggesting appropriate solutions,
measures and the establishment of means to help improve performance (measures to reactivate
credit, etc.). As a result, PNIR2 project helped highlight the constraints related to the renovation

                                                43
of rural infrastructures; this constitutes a significant step forward the achievement of rural areas’
opening objectives.

60.     Furthermore the advantages in terms of institutional reforms are more or less important
(this project helped the State establish a useful tool, which is the FER. However important
improvements on the diversification and increase of resources, their mobilization, their
sustainability and their security must be made by the Government in the management of the
railway to ensure road network maintenance sustainability.

61.    Finally the project resulted in DNPR project team skills development and the beginning
of database that would be of a certain interest for the establishment of the road maintenance
system.

b. The most significant negative lessons

62.       The following key weaknesses can be noted:

         The project initially suffered from the impacts of institutional reforms established by the
          Government and changes in the management team (change of DNPR guardianship,
          change of the project coordinators of the project change, movement of unit management
          staff);

         Mobilization, sustainability and the securing of resources to ensure proper road
          maintenance could not be carried out appropriately by the Road Maintenance. Pay/weigh
          could not be established and the implementation of the reform on the road maintenance
          did not favor the constitution of a successful company’s tissue in the sector. Indeed, the
          absorption capacity of the market generated by PNIR2 remained low due to delays on
          works;

         The project suffered from delay during project implementation for the credit
          effectiveness. The 7 years and 9 months delay did negatively influence the general
          timeline for project completion and deficiencies noted on the application of procedures ;
          and

         The lack of political stability in Guinea strongly affected the performance of the project.
          Indeed, multiple socio-political unrest, the suspension of disbursement and institutional
          instability were punitive factors on the performance of the project.

6. Recommandations

63.    In consideration of the above listed lessons, the following recommendations are
suggested:




                                                  44
a. To Guinea Government

64.     Apply systematically positive lessons learned with PNIR2 in the implementation of
future and current projects.

         Ensure a better involvement of populations and decentralized structures and all
          stakeholders in the identification, preparation and implementation of the project;

         Develop LIPW techniques and use it as much as possible to eradicate poverty and enable
          local populations to appropriate the project;

65.       Regarding the Road Maintenance Fund (RMF):

         Establish weighing and toll road on the network to create new resource for the RMF;

         Develop a three year or Five road maintenance program (Highway Design Manual
          (HDM) and Road Network Evaluation Tool (RONET) are powerful tools to assist in
          planning and decision-making for road maintenance);

         The allocation of resources for the network works should be consistent with the results of
          the Five-year road maintenance program;

         Improving resources mobilization by diversifying sources and by increasing taxes rate on
          petroleum products;

         Make more direct and fluid the resources collection process (including taxes petroleum
          products collection);

         Ensure that the private and civil society are well represented on the Board of Directors of
          the RMF;

         Ensure that the RMF has a better autonomy in its management;

         Create an executive road agency to perform works in the road network;

         Finalize the road database and extent it in the whole national road network;

         Ensure a better allotment of works which considers local businesses capacity and
          improve the quality of technical studies;

         Establish assistance and support plan to SMEs which considers funding, equipment,
          organization and management issues;

         If need be, consult a chattered Assistant and Advisor and Assistant to project coordinator
          in the process of implementing project activities;


                                                  45
      Take appropriate measures timely to revive or punish defaulters stakeholders during
       project implementation. This would help avoid lengthening the period of the project.;

      Take the required measures and adjustments to favor the good continuation of the project
       should an unpredicted even occurred in the course of project implementation.;

      Develop skills of structures in charge of internal and external project monitoring and
       establish a reliable archiving system for projects;

      Consider the level of qualification of the human resources of Governments from central
       departments during preparation and possibly reinforce their skills before starting project
       activities;

      Establish a high-performance system of sensitization and communication of all actors for
       a better ownership of the works and a perpetuation of the results; and

      Assure to reach a consensus on the objectives and the means to implement with all
       stakeholders to favor efficient results.

b. To the Bank

66.     The Bank has fully played its role by providing the Government with substantial
resources to complete the project. Unfortunately, major malfunctions did not help fully achieve
project original objectives.

      Study ways or possibilities to assist Guinea State in its policy of opening up of rural areas
       by developing rural infrastructures. In fact, Guinea which has just reached the HIPC
       completion point would require support for the financing of infrastructure by opening up,
       as far as its vision based on food security is concerned;

      Systematically organize supervision missions jointly with other financial and technical
       partners for a better efficiency of interventions;

      Guarantee from project identification and preparation steps, functionality of the
       institutional framework, and the reliability of information on local actors, projects and
       initiatives in progress, data reference so as to better project objectives and expected
       results from the project;

      Ensure during project evaluation the effective provision of institutions governmental
       partners in the implementation of activities;

      Help the State to continue the capacity-building on the new needs identified in the
       framework of the implementation of the reforms; indeed, at the end of PNIR2 project,
       each executing agency resources persons are sufficiently well known to identify training
       needs. Strengthening the skills of these experts must continue during post-project step to
       improve the project results dynamics by actors of the sector. This training should also

                                                46
    incorporate the expertise requirements for securing the sustainability of the project
    achievements; and

   For future projects of the same complexity in the example of PNIR2, the need to observe
    a certain flexibility in the project formulation and preparation as well as a better
    evaluation of risks. This provision would provide alternative solutions in order to ensure
    a better success chance in project implementation depending changes in socio-political
    situation and ownership of the results by beneficiaries.
