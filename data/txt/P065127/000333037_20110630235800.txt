A. Summary
1.      Following the International Development Association’s (IDA’s) reengagement in
the Republic of Guinea as per the Bank’s Operational Policy/Bank Procedure (OP/BP)
7.30, and the subsequent retroactive extension of closing date of the project from
December 31, 2009, to June 30, 2013, the Second National Rural Infrastructure Project
(PNIR2) is being restructured to: (i) revise the scope of project components in light of
project activities cost overruns, and in order to maximize the project’s impact without
changing the project development objectives (PDOs), (ii) revise the project’s results
framework, and (iii) amend the development credit agreement (DCA) to cancel outdated
clauses and covenants, and to create a new category of expenditure that will merge some
of the existing categories of the project.

2.      The proposed changes are necessary for a rapid turnaround of PNIR2 after two
years of inactivity following the December 2008 coup in Guinea. The proposed
restructuring will ensure optimal completion of works that were started before the
suspension of project activities and implement an action plan that is critical for the
attainment of PDOs of providing improved basic infrastructure and sustainable
infrastructure management and maintenance systems to rural populations in targeted
areas.


B. Project Status
3.       The project has faced several challenges during the course of its implementation.
First, the project took one year to become effective due to lack of institutional framework
satisfactory to IDA. Second, successive political crisis have disrupted its implementation
following the death of the President of Guinea in 2008. Consequently, IDA
disbursements have been suspended since 2008. This has literally frozen project
activities, except for the works of the Timbi-Madina logistics platform (TMLP) for which
(i) Bank’s clearance of the contract was secured before the suspension and (ii) a pre-
financing agreement was reached between the government and the contractor. Works for
the TMLP are still ongoing in a satisfactory manner. As of June 1, 2011, disbursement
from the IDA Credit stood at US$10.17 million, i.e. 33 percent of the total amount.

4.      By the time it was put on hold, the project had achieved significant progress, more
specifically: (i) improvement of 152 km of prefectural roads using conventional
contracting; (ii) maintenance of 194 km of prefectural roads and 30 meters of small
                                            1
bridges using labor-intensive methods; (iii) completion of the technical studies and
bidding documents for the construction of six bridges; and (iv) rehabilitation and
equipment of 36 war-affected public buildings.

5.       The 2008 Midterm review of PNIR2 had already shown a substantial financing
gap, and had consequently concluded that the project was unable to implement all its
activities as originally appraised. Furthermore, the three-year suspension of IDA
activities in Guinea has further exacerbated the project funding gap.

6.      As part of the reengagement efforts, the National Directorate of Rural Roads
(DNPR) - the agency responsible for project implementation - has elaborated a
reactivation strategy for PNIR2 based on the following pillars: (i) repayment of all
eligible project arrears; (ii) optimal completion of all activities and works that were
ongoing when the project was put on hold; (iii) scale up of labor intensive road
maintenance works program to achieve impact in terms of rural accessibility and youth
employment; and (iv) optimization of the Timbi-Madina Pilot Potato Platform through
the financing of additional works around the platform. The revised project activities list,
resulting from this strategy was reviewed by the Bank team and is presented in section C
of this paper.

7.     The reactivation strategy was translated into an action plan (see Annex 2) that
covers a period of 24 months from February 2011, to February 2013, whereby all project
funds will be fully committed by December 3, 2011, and fully disbursed by mid-2013.

8.      As documented in previously archived Implementation Status Reports (ISRs),
overall safeguards compliance is moderately satisfactory and there are no unresolved
legal, or safeguard issues. Table 1 shows the status of compliance of legal covenants.

                respectively, and until such time,
                                                                   December           Partially

                2005, and 2006, respectively

9.      The Borrower has confirmed and the Bank has verified that key staffs in charge of
financial management and safeguards are in place and are operational. Project
development objectives continue to be achievable despite the proposed revision in the
scope of project activities.


    C. Proposed Changes
Results/indicators: are summarized in Annex 1 - Results Framework and Monitoring.

10.     Although the PDOs remain unchanged, the results framework is being revised and
fine-tuned in the light of proposed changes in the scope of activities, and to include
mandatory core sector indicators.

11.     Components: The scope of project components will be revised as follows: (i)
Component A: Rural Roads: 470 km of maintenance of prefectural roads using
conventional contracting methods will be executed instead of the initially planned 920
km; and three rural bridges will be constructed instead of six initially planned; and (ii)
Component C: Pilot Commercial Infrastructure: only the Timbi-Madina Potato Platform
will be constructed.

12.     Cancelled activities: (i) Component A: Rural Roads: The study for the definition
of a rural road maintenance strategy is cancelled. (ii) Component C: Pilot Commercial
Infrastructure: The construction of the Kankan Mango and Citrus Platform is cancelled.

13.     New activities: (i) Component A: Rural Roads: development of a rural road
database for DNPR. (ii) Component B: Emergency reconstruction in war affected
communities: maintenance of an additional 100 km of prefectural roads using labor-
intensive methods; and (iii) Component C: Pilot Commercial Infrastructure: construction
of 10 strategic transit storage warehouses for potato production in the areas of Pita and
Lélouma to ensure optimal potato supply to the Timbi-Madina logistics Platform.

  The first part of this covenant relative to the RER was fully complied with on December 27, 2006 by way
of inter-ministerial decree number A/2006/7465/MTPT/MEF/SGG. The second part of this covenant
relative to the budget of FER has not been fully complied with: (i) in 2004, FER budget was GNF
18,220,000,000, (ii) GNF 19,710,000,000 in 2005, and (iii) GNF 32,930,000, in 2006.
