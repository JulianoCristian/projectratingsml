                         Implementation Status Overview
                         A third restructuring was approved on June 30, 2011 to reduce the scope of project components in light of cost overruns, and in order to optimize the project's impact without
                         changing the Project Development Objectives (PDOs). Following said restructuring; the project has achieved significant progress in terms of implementation, more specifically with:
                         (a) the completion of the Timbi-Madina potato logistics platform; (b) the procurement of works for 3 key rural bridges; and (c) the reactivation of the labor-intensive road maintenance
                         works throughout the country.
