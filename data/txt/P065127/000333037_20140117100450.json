Some lessons learned included: the labor\n            intensive maintenance components had strong ownership by\n            project beneficiaries and the targeted length was entirely\n            executed. This is because the beneficiaries of this\n            particular component and local contractors worked together\n            to ensure the implementation of labor intensive maintenance\n            works. A well-functioning institutional arrangement for the\n            project is a critical factor to ensure implementation\n            success. In the case of the project, this risk should have\n            been mitigated as part of the preparation process, even if\n            it will have resulted in a delay in project approval. As the\n            project implementation unit is a key to project\n            implementation, earlier training program should have been\n            put in place for project key staff. The project included an\n            indicator on road maintenance while the project did not\n            support this activity directly since it did not provide\n            funding to the Road Maintenance Fund. This means that there\n            is need for a careful selection of indicators and a need to\n            ensure that sufficient leverage exists at the project level\n            for some indicators and even reforms."}, "docdt": "2013-12-24T00:00:00Z"}
