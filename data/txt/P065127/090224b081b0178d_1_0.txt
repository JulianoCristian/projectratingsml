                         The project has faced a multitude of challenges during the course of its implementation. First, the project took one year to become effective due to lack of institutional framework
                         satisfactory to IDA. Second, successive political crisis have disrupted its implementation following the death of the President of Guinea in 2008. Consequently, IDA disbursements
                         were suspended between 2008 and 2011, which froze project activities, except for the works of the Timbi-Madina logistics platform (TMLP) for which: (i) Bank’s clearance of the
                         contract was secured before the suspension; and (ii) a pre-financing agreement was reached between the government and the contractor.

                         Following the International Development Association’s (IDA’s) reengagement with the Government of Guinea (GOG) under Bank’s Operational Policy/Bank Procedure (OP/BP) 7.30,
                         the closing date of the project was retroactively extend from December 31, 2009, to June 30, 2013. The project was also restructured to revise the scope of project components in
                         light of project activities cost overruns, and in order to maximize the project’s impact without changing the project development objectives (PDOs).
