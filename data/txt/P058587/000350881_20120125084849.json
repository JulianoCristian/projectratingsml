"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Regional Fiscal\n            Technical Assistance Project for Russian Federation were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was low or negligible, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the Bank and\n            Finance Ministry have become strong partners in the area of\n            fiscal federalism and broader Public Financial Management\n            (PFM) reform over the 11 years of the operation. There\n            appears to be a level of confidence and goodwill on both\n            sides which facilitates open dialogue. The various\n            extensions of the project, whatever the valid questions\n            regarding the role and length of investment projects, or\n            costs to the Bank's administrative budget, reflected a\n            level of commitment by the Bank to a well performing project\n            and a serious client which should not be discounted. The\n            multi-year project helped the client to conduct deep and\n            thorough reforms of PFM and intergovernmental fiscal\n            relations, to transform those systems into the modern ones.\n            The Bank's ability to contribute to this economic and\n            social development of this partner can only have been\n            enhanced by the Bank's record in staying the course and\n            showing flexibility by adhering to its highest goals in\n            bringing the best it could offer to this client. Commitment\n            and shared vision are salient for all Bank projects. But\n            operations which seek to change policies, procedures,\n            incentives across a country's public sector, and\n            sometimes touch the core of a nation's political\n            economy, require a higher threshold of counterpart\n            understanding, dedication, and leadership. The steadfast\n            support of key officials within the Finance Ministry across\n            a 14 year period from project preparation to loan closure is\n            impressive. The rarity of such sustained commitment or\n            stability in counterpart champions attests to its value in\n            this case. Bank operations in public sector reform too often\n            rest on the narrow shoulders of reform champions whose\n            admirable willingness to undertake worthy efforts can also\n            suggest vulnerability and short tenure. The Bank team also\n            sought to assure in preparation that the project enjoyed\n            high level support and designed a governance structure to\n            involve and inform key stakeholders."}, "docdt": "2011-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
