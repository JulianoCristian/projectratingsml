The first strengthens federal and\n            regional fiscal legislation by financing international\n            experts and local consultants, equalization transfers for\n            the regions, federal regulations that monitor sub-national\n            fiscal performance, and analysis of existing legislation on\n            sub-national public finance and inter-governmental fiscal\n            relations. The second component strengthens federal\n            monitoring capacity, specifically providing technical\n            assistance to fortify institutional capacity in designing,\n            implementation, and monitoring structural reforms and\n            performance at the sub-national level. Expenditures include\n            computer and information technology, the creation of a\n            library and on-line databases, development and dissemination\n            of principles of good practice for regional financial\n            management, design of financial disclosure requirements,\n            ongoing monitoring of fiscal and structural reforms and\n            compliance with federal laws and regulations, analytical\n            support and policy advice, training, as well as office\n            furnishings and administrative and computer support.
