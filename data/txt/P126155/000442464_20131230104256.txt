1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1.         Context at Appraisal

1. At project appraisal, President Banda, who came to office after the sudden
death of President Bingu Wa Mutharika in April 2012, had just inherited a very
difficult economic environment. Under a fixed exchange rate regime, the economy was
out of control with base money growth of close to 55 percent, which fueled inflationary
pressures and widened the spread between official exchange rate and the black market
rate. The foreign exchange market had collapsed and the strengthened government
administrative controls further pushed the demand for foreign exchange into the black
market. The international reserves were depleted to less than half month of import cover.
The drying up of fuel supplies and the loss of external credit lines paralyzed the private
sector operations, which resulted in scaled down operations and the laying off of workers.
The fiscal deficit under the ‘zero-deficit budget’ was unsustainable. Inflationary pressures
were high at the time of appraisal given the large central bank financing of government
budget and the devaluation of Kwacha undertaken in 2011.

2. The Banda administration, immediately after assuming office, implemented
bold and politically difficult reforms to address the external and internal
macroeconomic imbalances while cushioning the poor from the impact of
adjustment. Foreign exchange reforms included adoption of a floating exchange rate
regime following a one-step devaluation of 50 percent in the official rate ; allowing banks
and foreign exchange bureaus to set the rate at which they buy and sell foreign exchange
from/to their customers; removing the requirement for foreign exchange earnings to be
surrendered to the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM); and cancelling the requirement for
banks to submit to the RBM for review any application for external payments exceeding
US$50,000. The authorities also announced the re-instatement of the automatic
adjustment mechanism for petroleum products so that domestic fuel prices track
movements in import parity prices.

3. The GoM adopted tight monetary and fiscal policies, to contain aggregate
demand so as to achieve a real devaluation. If the reforms adopted were to be effective,
aggregate demand had to be suppressed by containing the rise in wages to effect a real
devaluation and contain inflationary pressures as relative prices were adjusting and
passing through to the real economy. To support these outcomes the GoM put together a
pragmatic 2012/13 national budget, which was anchored on 'Zero Net Domestic
Financing'; the plan being to effect a significant adjustment in the fiscal balance through
fiscal consolidation measures. On the other hand, monetary tightening took the form of
increasing the bank rate from 13 percent to 16 percent in May 20121.




1
    Further tightening was made in July and September 2012, when the rate was increased to 21 percent and 25 percent, respectively.




                                                                   1
4. In the absence of these reforms, the macroeconomic imbalances would have
significantly worsened leading to a complete collapse of the economy. Under a
scenario of no policy reforms prior to the May 2014 general elections, the IMF had
projected a continued output and export contraction, import contraction, erosion in the
government revenue base, increased resort to central bank financing and rising inflation.
It was expected that by the end of 2012 the economy would have slowed down to below
2 percent and that further into 2013 the economy would have entered into a policy
induced recession.

5. Support to the GoM reform agenda by development partners (DPs) and IDA
was also instrumental in providing the assurances needed that the reform would be
sustained. A collective effort by DPs resulted in the significant increase of grants from
4.4 percent of GDP in 2011/12 to 14.4 percent in 2012/13. The Rapid Response
Development Policy Grant (RRDPG), which was part of the US$150 million IDA Rapid
Response Program (RRP), was critical in providing the much needed financing to support
these reforms and the assurances needed by private sector and the public that the reforms
would be sustained. In addition to the RRDPG, the RRP comprised of two Additional
Financing (AF) operations under the Malawi Third Social Action Fund APL II (MASAF
3) and the Irrigation Rural Livelihoods and Agricultural Development Project (IRLADP).
The Program was consistent with the objectives of the FY07-11 Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS), and was aligned to the GoM’s Economic Recovery Plan (ERP), and the
Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS 2).

6. At appraisal, the GoM and the IMF were in the process of negotiating a new
three year Extended Credit Facility (ECF) following the authorities’ request to
cancel the previous ECF program, which was approved by the Fund in 2010 before
going off track in June 2011. Specific objectives of the new ECF Program approved by
the IMF Board in July 2012 included achievement and maintenance of a stable
macroeconomic environment with low inflation; increasing foreign exchange reserves;
and undertaking structural reforms to improve the investment climate and promote
sustained and inclusive growth.


1.2. Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

7. As set forth in the Program Document, the key objectives of the grant were to
support the recovery of Malawi’s economy through: (i) achieving and maintaining
macroeconomic stability, and restoring the functioning of a market-based economy to
ensure a quick growth rebound; and (ii) protecting the poor and most vulnerable groups
in the short run while improving transparency of delivery systems.

The overall RRDPG outcome indicators, identified in the program document were:
 Reduction in the fiscal deficit from 7.0% of GDP in 2011/12, to less than 2.0% of
   GDP by June 2013.
 Increase in volume of fuel imports from 160 million litres in 2011/12, to projected
   300 million liters.


                                           2
   Increase in net earnings to an average tobacco farmer from MWK160,483 to about
    MWK252,393 after exchange rate liberalization.
   An increase in ratio of total Labor Intensive Public Works (LIPW) related
    expenditure to total recurrent expenditure from 1.5 percent in 2011/12, to 6.5 percent
    by June 2013, and expanded coverage of the beneficiaries from 311,807 households,
    to 700,000 households by June 2013.
   An increase in ratio of total fertilizer and seeds subsidy related expenditure to total
    recurrent expenditure from 7.5 percent in 2011/12, to over 12 percent by June 2013,
    and expanded coverage of the beneficiaries from 1.4 million farming households in
    2011/12, to 1.5 million farming households by June 2013.
   Fertilizer Inputs Subsidy Programme (FISP) procurement audit report submitted to
    Parliament by June 2013.

1.3. Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

The PDOs and indicators were not revised during program implementation.

1.4.   Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

Policy Area I: Achieving and maintaining macroeconomic stability and restoring the
functioning of a market-based economy to ensure a quick growth rebound.

8.       Restore macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability. The RRDPG sought
to support the GoM’s effort to address the severe economic crisis and restore
macroeconomic stability and thereby setting conditions for quick rebound of economic
activities while cushioning the most vulnerable. The reform supported by the RRDPG
aimed at ensuring that the 2012/13 national budget, which was anchored on zero net
domestic borrowing, was consistent with these objectives. The plan was to bring about a
large fiscal adjustment through a combination of corrective revenue and spending control
measures intended to reduce aggregate demand pressures and to achieve fiscal
sustainability over the medium term, while prioritizing social expenditures.

9.      Improve the functioning of the petroleum market. The policy goal was to re-
establish a pricing policy that results in retail petroleum prices that are fully reflective of
import parity prices, through the reinstatement of the Automatic Pricing Mechanism
(APM). The petroleum market was virtually collapsing and the administered prices were
not adequate to ensure that all costs in the supply chain were covered. In this regard, the
intended outcome was the normalization of supply of petroleum goods in an economy
that was facing serious fuel supply problems, with dried up lines of external credit, and
eliminate fiscal risks inherent in state’s role in fuel pricing. The RRDPG supported APM
allowed for the adjustment of fuel prices at the pump on a regular basis in response to
movements in the world petroleum prices and exchange rate.

10.    Improve incentives to exporters. In a bid to incentivize exports, the RRDPG
supported reform measures aimed at liberalizing the exchange rate and removing the
requirement for foreign exchange earnings to be surrendered to RBM. Prior to the


                                              3
reforms, Malawi’s official exchange rate was overvalued causing persistent imbalances in
the foreign exchange market, with transactions increasingly taking place in the informal
market. The overvalued exchange rate and tight administrative regulations also acted as a
disincentive to exporters who were subject to mandatory repatriation and surrender
requirements. The fixed exchange rate regime effectively implied a tax on exporters,
which according to a 2011 IMF TA report, was estimated to have cost exporters about 4
percent and 6 percent of GDP in 2010 and 2011, respectively. The CEM 2010 recognized
the exchange rate reform as the foremost constraint to competitiveness in the economy.

Policy Area II: Protecting the vulnerable groups while improving transparency of
systems

11.      Scaling up of social protection interventions. The objective of this action was to
cushion the most vulnerable groups from the negative impact of devaluation and other
policies, and those affected by the dry spells in the southern region. The plan was to
expand the FISP by an additional 100,000 beneficiaries in 2012/13 from 1.4 million
farming families covered in 2011/12. This was to be complemented with a country-wide
expansion of the labor intensive public works program through MASAF and IRLADP
with coverage of about 700,000 households. The expanded FISP included more legumes
which would also enhance nutritional status of households and increase incomes for
households. The RRDPG therefore ensured that sufficient resources were allocated in the
budget to support the scaling up of the program country-wide; ensuring timely delivery of
fertilizer to small holders and in turn contributing towards increased food production.

12.      Improve Economic Management of FISP. The RRDPG provided support to the
GoM’s efforts to improve efficiency and value for money in public procurement by
institutionalizing annual procurement audits for FISP in the GoM’s systems. The
objective was to improve economic management of FISP and enhance efficiency of the
FISP, especially in use of budgetary resources and transparency in the contract awarding
process.2 This reform was intended to operationalize the GoM’s commitment to
mainstream the FISP procurement review process into annual procurement audits, which
were going to be conducted by the National Audit Office (NAO) so as to strengthen
ownership and transparency in FISP procurement.

1.5.       Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)

13.        The policy areas were not revised.

1.6.       Other significant changes

14.    There were no significant changes in design, scope and scale, implementation
arrangements, or funding.



2
 Since 2006, the FISP has been the major program in the agricultural sector covering over 60 percent of the total agriculture budget.
Fertilizer under FISP is highly subsidized (over 95 percent subsidy as farmers pay MKW500 per 50kg bag of fertilizer) and remains a
huge fiscal risk.


                                                                 4
2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1.    Program Performance

15.     The overall performance of the program was satisfactory. Several key policy
actions, identified as prior actions in the program (Table 1), were taken upfront by the
GoM. The GoM maintained a solid commitment to macroeconomic policy reforms and
fiscal management stayed on track. Two successful reviews of IMF’s ECF program were
carried out. The program’s impact on macroeconomic outcomes was mostly along the
desired and expected lines thereby vindicating the soundness of underlying analysis. At
completion three out of six results indicators exceeded the set targets and of the
remaining three, two were significantly met. These indicators were directly related to the
successful implementation of the Government’s program of economic recovery, with a
special emphasis on prudent fiscal management, restoring the functioning of the market
economy, and scaling up social support systems. The program had included submission
of the FISP audit report to the Parliament as a results indicator; this was not met.

2.2.    Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

Adequacy of Government’s Commitment

16.     Strong GoM commitment to the economic reform agenda was key to the
success of the program. This commitment was expressed at the highest level by the
President of the Republic during her State of the Nation address to the Parliament in May
2012, which outlined the comprehensive plan for the recovery of Malawi’s economy and
this was also the focus of the President’s State of Nations address in February 2013
(Unity of Purpose towards Economic Recovery). However the strongest indication of the
extent of this commitment is the fact that at the time of the ICR, the government had
stayed the course on the core elements of the reforms (exchange rate policy, and Kwacha
cost-reflective pricing of petroleum products) despite of public pressures.

Soundness of Background Analysis

17.     The operation was based on sound analytical work. The DPO was designed on
the basis of the analytical work undertaken prior to the preparation of the operation which
provided the basis for the identification of priority program areas and the rationale for the
selection of policy actions. The implementation of the reforms was significantly
enhanced by the analytical work. The main underpinning analytical work was the
Comprehensive Package on Competitiveness, Growth and Poverty Reduction (CPCGPR),
which was presented to the economic management team of the Cabinet in March 2012,
proposing measures to restore economic stability, kick start growth rebound, and
presented a realistic plan to scale-up social protection.The operation also benefited from
other studies listed in Box 1 below and from other works undertaken by other DPs and
the IMF, in particular the Article IV documents (2012). These knowledge products, in
addition to those done by others, provided the analytical background for the design of the
operation.

Box 1: Analytical Underpinnings
Comprehensive Package on Competitiveness, Growth and Poverty Reduction (2012).
Presented to the economic management team of the Cabinet in March 2012, proposing measures
to restore economic stability, kick start growth rebound, and presented a realistic plan to scale-
up social protection.
Welfare Impacts and Mitigation of Exchange Rate Unification in Malawi (2012). This study
assessed the welfare impact of devaluation induced price changes. The note proposed two
compensation scenarios through Labor Intensive Public Works (LIPW) Programs to partially
cover the loss of welfare of the poorest 60 percent of the rural and urban population. It also
evaluated additional mitigation via tobacco (for growers) if a timely devaluation towards
FOREX unification was undertaken, where it indicated that the original losses due to FOREX
parity induced price increases, could be ameliorated in as much as 32%, on average, among
tobacco farmers, with the largest effects benefiting the poorest growers.
Comprehensive Exchange Rate and Foreign Exchange Study for Malawi (2012).Provided
the genesis of the foreign exchange imbalances - how the GoM got into this situation, -
identified the main causes of external imbalances and effects of the chronic foreign exchange
shortages and the associated real exchange rate appreciation in the economy, and proposed
possible policy responses, including the unification of the exchange rate and fiscal and monetary


                                                6
restraint. The note also presented a brief analysis of pass-through effect of exchange.
Country Economic Memorandum (2010). Identified constraints to growth, including an
overvalued exchange rate, inadequate power supply, and lack of trade facilitation among others.
It also clearly identifies the public expenditure management as a key reform area for containing
the growth of GoM’s spending and maintaining fiscal stability.


Assessment of the Operation’s Design

18.     The design of the operation was well-aligned with the development objectives
and aided satisfactory implementation of the program. An important feature was the
front-loading of all key policy actions in the form of prior actions. This design feature
reduced the risks of piecemeal approach to policy reforms and allowed rapid
disbursement which helped stabilize the country’s external position. Given the
emergency nature of the operation, a single tranche operation was well-suited. The
operation was well-timed vis-à-vis the Government’s budget cycle and IMF’s ECF
program. The operation was also nicely complemented with two investment projects. The
decision to package the three operations under the RRP was meant to maximize on the
synergies between the RRDPG and the investment lending operations (Additional
Financing for MASAF and IRLAD), where the two projects were geared towards
cushioning the poor and most vulnerable through productive employment as well as
support the supply response through the construction of small irrigation schemes to
support irrigation activities during the winter season.

Relevance of Risks Identified

19.    The risks identified at appraisal stage were relevant and the measures to
mitigate the risks were effective. The four risks identified at appraisal (shortfall in
donor support, political risks, social tensions and implementation capacity) were relevant
and were well mitigated through mitigating measures proposed as follows:

(a)     The risk of shortfalls in donor support was mitigated by actions by the
authorities to repair relations with DPs and continued commitment of the
Government, which saw the resumption of budget support (0 percent of GDP in 2011/12
to 6.3 percent in 2012/13) from some CABS DP, including IDA, the Africa Development
Bank, and the European Union. Even for those DPs who were not able to resume their
normal budget support for various reasons like the United Kingdom and Germany, they
were still able to provide emergency budget support and/or balance of payments support.

(b)      Political risks and social tensions were largely mitigated through social
protection support and improved communications strategies. It appears that the
mitigating factors against social tension risks have worked to a large extent considering
the fact that the momentum of the reforms has been maintained despite significant
external pressures. Despite delays, and in some cases insufficient communication by the
authorities on the objectives of the reform program, including measures put in place to
cushion the poor, the authorities managed to mitigate any serious political fallout,
although pressures have continued to mount as the country gears itself for the May 2014
tripartite elections. Social tensions intensified around wage increase disputes and

                                               7
increases in nominal prices; manifesting into industrial actions in both private and public
sectors. The GoM was involved in intense negotiations with the labor unions and this
mitigated the risk of heightened social tension.

(c) Implementation capacity risks. There was a risk that GoM’s capacity to massively
scale up social safety net programs would have been overstretched. This would have
risked delaying the implementation of the programs supported by this operation and
would have led to low utilization of available resources and insufficient coverage of
beneficiaries. With large part of the financing coming from development partners,
through existing programs with well-established institutional structures, including the
Bank’s support through MASAF and IRLAD, this risk was minimized. Despite the delays
in launching the FISP procurement process due to cancellation of the first bidding
process, the implementation of the FISP was relatively smooth.

Other Factors Affecting Implementation (Factors beyond Government Control)

20.    Strong donor coordination and support. This factor had a positive impact on
implementation. In recent years donor coordination has been strong in Malawi. The
Bank’s response through the RRDPG was coordinated with responses from other DPs,
including the Common Approach to Budget Support (CABS) DPs framework. The CABS
represents a group of development partners3 that use a joint approach in the provision of
budgetary support to the GoM. The Bank also worked closely with the IMF on numerous
aspects of this operation. Work was coordinated and done jointly in a number of areas
including the Debt Sustainability Analysis; monitoring fiscal developments; Joint Staff
Advisory Note of the MGDS 2; and Article IV mission.

21.    Drought conditions in parts of the country prolonged the inflationary process
that was in motion since 2011. The price of maize (the staple food) shot up in the
second half of 2012 due to a decline in output arising from drought conditions in parts of
the country. It is estimated that about 2 million people (about 12 percent of the total
population) faced food deficits in the period before harvest of March/April 2013.

22.     Tight liquidity conditions in the banking system left several banks stranded
and resorting to the RBM discount window to meet their liquidity needs. Prior to the
devaluation of the kwacha in May 2012, banks were awash with the domestic currency
due to high government spending and failure to meet foreign obligations because of
scarcity of foreign exchange. Banks used this liquidity to extend long term loans to
various sectors of the economy and/or to undertake expansion drives in terms of points of
representation. Following the devaluation, foreign exchange became available and as
clients sought to clear their external payment obligations by withdrawing deposits, banks
had difficulty unwinding the long positions they had taken. In order to provide relief to
the hardest hit banks which continued to have difficulty meeting liquidity requirements,
the RBM introduced a temporary window for providing short-term uncollateralized loans
to the banks. The window fed money supply growth, fueling inflationary pressures. The

the excess liquidity, with money supply (year-on- year) slowing down from 38 percent in
November 2012 to 26 percent in June 2013.

23.     Excess demand for foreign exchange, partly to clear the backlog of external
payment arrears, exerted further pressure on the Kwacha. The magnitude of the
external payment arrears was much higher than originally thought –more than double
amounting to between US$700 million- US$ 1 billion- and the decision by the private
sector to clear these arrears immediately after the reforms were instituted meant that the
demand on forex far exceeded its supply, which put significant pressure on the Kwacha.
The occurrence of these shocks contributed to the delays in the stabilization of the
Kwacha rate.

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

24.     Progress against RRDPG targets was monitored by Bank staff during the
course of the year through bi-annual reviews within CABS framework and Staff
Missions, especially under the social safety net pillar. Following previous successful
budget support operations, the review of the program objectives was based on relevant
and easy-to-monitor indicators. In addition, the operation also benefitted from the
monitoring system of the IMF ECF program i.e. quarterly reviews, notably on the
macroeconomic performance, and the monitoring of public finance management
indicators under the PFEM Reform Program supported through a Bank managed Multi
Donor Trust Fund (MDTF).

25.     M& E Design: The M&E for the operation was appropriately designed with a mix
set of quantitative and qualitative outcome indicators which were well defined and linked
with the policy actions. These indicators were selected in agreement with the Government
(involving sector ministries) and to some extent other DPs taking into account the
availability of data, their relevance and feasibility.

26.      M & E Implementation: The data used for M&E purposes were all official data
collected primarily from the sector ministries and departments of the Government,
principally Ministry of Finance (MoF), Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security
(MoAFS) and, Ministry of Economic Planning and Development (MEPD), Malawi
Energy Regulatory Authority (MERA), Tobacco Association of Malawi (TAMA),
Tobacco Control Commission (TCC), and Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM), National
Statistics Office (NSO). Data was collected in a timely manner for most of the indicators by
the responsible agencies. This greatly facilitated the close monitoring of progress towards
outcomes. Overall, the status of the GoM’s program was well monitored during the biannual
CABS review meetings in October 2012 and March 2013, where progress towards outcomes
was measured and allowed the Bank teams to continue the policy dialogue with the
institutions involved in program implementation. The ERP M&E framework provided more
information on many of the outcome indicators and facilitated the monitoring of both the
GoM plan and to some extent the RRDPG.


                                             9
27.     M&E Utilization: The M&E framework for the RRDPG served as a useful tool
to assessing progress towards the implementation of the program. During the operation,
the Bank and Government teams went through the monitoring indicators in the context of
the CABS Reviews and IMF ECF Review missions, to assess progress made and to
ascertain whether the results were diverging from expected and targeted outcomes.

2.4    Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

28.     A new programmatic DPO series was launched in 2012/13 with the approval
of the first of the three single tranche operation (DPO-1) by the Board on May 28,
2013. The proposed DPO series intends to support policy and institutional reforms under
the MGDS II and the ERP aimed at: (i) strengthening macroeconomic and public finance
management and, (ii) promoting economic development and diversification. The program
is geared towards consolidating the macroeconomic and structural reforms supported by
the Rapid Response Program, approved by the Board in July 2012 and sets the stage for
longer term structural reforms for the post 2014 period.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1.   Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating for Relevance of Objectives: Substantial
Rating for Relevance of Design and Implementation: Substantial

29.    Rating for Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation is
substantial. It reflects proper diagnosis of development priorities that remain relevant at
the time of the ICR. The program was a timely and comprehensive response to client’s
needs during a time of crisis, though in hindsight the transparency related goal was
ambitious.

Relevance of Objectives

30.     The RRDPG’s objectives were highly relevant to the GoM’s reform agenda
at appraisal and still remain relevant in the current country context where policy
emphasis is on accelerating the economic recovery process and entrenching
macroeconomic stability. The objectives set in the RRDPG were consistent with the
objectives of the FY07-11/FY13-16 CAS, and aligned to MGDS II and in the ERP. The
RRDPG supported priorities in areas identified in the CAS and also outlined in the ERP
including: i) prudent fiscal policy and sound macroeconomic management to restore
internal and external balance; ii) increase productivity and diversification of agriculture;
and, improving social safety net systems. The RRDPG was also based on sound
analytical work, which helped ensure relevance of its objectives. While good progress has


                                            10
been made towards achieving the program’s objectives (as set out in section 1.2); these
reforms will need to be sustained over the medium term to have meaningful impact on
poverty reduction.

Relevance of design and implementation

31.     The program content was underpinned by strong analytical foundation and
was directly relevant to the PDOs aimed at achieving and maintaining macroeconomic
stability, restoring the functioning of a market-based economy, and protecting the poor
and most vulnerable groups. The design of the operation was in line with the need to
provide quick relief in a crisis situation. The RRDPG enabled the GoM to consolidate
the economic reform measures by institutionalizing them and addressing the gaps in their
legal framework. For example, the prior action on the monthly reviews of the petroleum
prices empowered MERA to undertake these reviews every second week of each month
despite heavy political pressures to reverse the reform. With hindsight, it is the view of
this ICR that the emergency DPO (focused on providing rapid relief in an emergency
situation) was not the appropriate tool to address deep seated governance reforms aimed
at improving transparency in FISP procurement.

3.2.   Achievement of Program Development Objectives

32.     Achievement of PDOs is rated Substantial. The RRDPG achieved its program
development objectives and its outcome indicators related to recovering the economy and
expanding a safety net around the most vulnerable people. In pillar 1, the program
contributed towards i) achieving macroeconomic stability and, ii) re-establishment of
formal market transactions, including restoring a fully functional petroleum market. In
pillar 2, the operation contributed towards the strengthening of the resilience of the poor
and most vulnerable through expanded social protection interventions. The FISP
procurement audit was not undertaken.

Objective 1: Achieving and maintaining macroeconomic stability, and restoring the
functioning of a market-based economy to ensure a quick growth rebound- High.

Achieving and maintaining macroeconomic stability-High
Restoring the functioning of a market-based economy-High
Overall rating: High

(a)    Achieving and Maintaining Macro-Economic Stability

33.     Policy reforms initiated in May 2012 had their intended effect and economic
recovery was well underway by June 2013. The introduction of a flexible exchange
rate regime has improved the availability of foreign currency and the restoration of the
forex market has facilitated the clearing of private sector external arrears. Improved
confidence in the functioning of the market has also led to re-establishment of external


                                            11
credit lines and improved allocation of forex. In parallel, adoption of an automatic
adjustment mechanism for the retail prices of petroleum products has normalized the
supply to the market. With needed production inputs now available, capacity utilization
in the manufacturing sector rose sharply, contributing to a broad-based expansion of real
GDP in 2013 after a contraction in 2012. Additionally, the timing of the reforms on
exchange rate unification saw the net earnings of smallholder tobacco farmers earnings
increase on average by118 percent in 2012/13, compared with 2011/12.

34.     The adoption and execution of the 2012/13 national budget observed the
fiscal anchor of ‘zero net domestic financing’ resulting in the reduction of fiscal
deficit. This policy stance resulted in a reduction in the fiscal deficit from 8.4 percent of
GDP in 2011/12, to 0.8 percent of GDP in 2012/13; contributing to the reduction in net
domestic debt from 19.5 percent of GDP in 2011/12, to 18.5 percent of GDP in
2012/13.The significant fiscal adjustment was aided by a surge in aid inflows, including
budgetary support, improved domestic revenue mobilization and expenditure
consolidation. Specifically, domestic revenues increased by 1.9 percent of GDP from
22.1 percent of GDP in 2011/12. Grants registered a surge from 4.4 percent of GDP in
2011/12, to 14.2 percent of GDP in 2012/13 as budget support was resumed. The higher
grants provided by development partners (including IDA) allowed for both higher social
spending and reduced domestic financing to help stabilize the exchange rate and start
building up reserves.

(b)    Restoring the functioning of a market based economy

i. Restoring the functioning of the foreign exchange market

35.     The foreign exchange market is now fully functional, and the introduction of
a flexible exchange rate has made foreign currency readily available, allowing the
clearing of private sector foreign arrears and re-establishment of external credit
lines. Adjustment of the grossly overvalued exchange rate and the removal of restrictions
on foreign exchange transactions have attracted foreign exchange inflows into the
banking system from the black market and facilitated the elimination of an artificial fixed
exchange rate regime at which no transactions were taking place. Collectively this helped
clear most of the external payments arrears accumulated by the private sector (estimated
at between USD 700 million- 1 billion), and facilitated the re-establishment of
international credit lines for critical imports to enhance capacity utilization, estimated
currently at over 70 percent.

36.     The unification of the exchange rates and adoption of a floating exchange
rate regime is also incentivizing exports, and smallholder tobacco farmers have been
primary beneficiaries. The new exchange rate regime has removed the implicit tax on
exports that prevailed under the fixed exchange rate regime. The real exchange rate
depreciation is incentivizing traditional exports and promoting the expansion of non-
traditional exports. For example, according to Ministry of Agriculture data, ground nut

                                             12
and pulses production went up by 4 percent and 13 percent, respectively in 2012/13, over
2011/12 production levels. The removal of the surrender requirement for tobacco dollars
and the timing of the reforms greatly benefited smallholder tobacco farmers and
improved their livelihoods as they were able to receive their payments for the sale of
tobacco at prevailing (liberalized) market rate in their respective banks. These reforms in
effect boosted the net incomes of an average farmer from MWK160,483 in 2011/12, to
about MWK349,308 in 2012/134 beyond the program target of MWK 252,393, and
effectively acted as a cushioning measure for about 400,000 tobacco farmers.

ii. Restoring the functioning of the petroleum market

37.     The APM for prices of petroleum products has facilitated the re-
establishment of steady supply of fuel to the market. Petroleum retail prices are now
fully reflective of import parity prices, as the Malawi Energy Regulatory Authority
(MERA) has maintained the policy of reviewing import parity prices every second week
of the month with the view of adjusting domestic retail prices if the thresholds have been
breached. Prior to this reform, fuel supplies through the formal markets were contracting
and this paved way for a lucrative black market where the fuel price ranged from US$4-6
per litre depending on availability. The formal market mechanism was essentially
collapsing with consumers queuing for days just to access the minimal fuel through the
official marketing channels. The reforms have not only facilitated the normalization of
fuel supply, but the fuel is available at regionally comparable prices of US$1.71/litre in
December 2013.5 The reinstatement of the APM has restored the credibility of the market
system, with imports increasing from about 160 million liters in 2011/12, to about 293
million liters 2012/13.

Objective 2: protecting the poor and most vulnerable groups in the short run while
improving transparency of delivery systems- Substantial

Protecting the most vulnerable groups- High
Improving transparency of systems- Negligible

38.     The poor and most vulnerable were worse-off from the effects of price
changes induced by the significant loss in value of the kwacha in the parallel market
before the unification of the exchange rate. As mitigating measures, the analysis
considered two compensation scenarios (at 33 percent and 50 percent levels) through
labor intensive public works (LIPW) programs to partially cover the loss of welfare of the
poorest 60 percent of the rural and urban population. The unification of the exchange rate
which was undertaken in time for tobacco farmers to receive adjusted prices ameliorated
about 32 percent of the original losses due to devaluation-induced increases in nominal
prices.

(a) Protecting the poor and most vulnerable groups- Labor Intensive Public Works
Program

39.     To protect the poor and most vulnerable groups, the 2012/13 national budget
increased budgetary allocations to social safety net interventions, including labor-
intensive public works. Inclusive in the reform agenda was a social dimension to scale
up safety nets expenditures as percentage of the recurrent budget to 6.5 percent, from 1.5
percent in 2011/12, with the bulk of the expansion coming within six months of the fiscal
year. Malawi has underdeveloped social safety nets systems which have traditionally
averaged around 2 percent of the recurrent budget over the past 5 years. This significant
effort was intended to ensure that vulnerable groups affected by the policies of the
previous administration as well as any unintended effects of the Government’s reform
program were cushioned. Through the national budget, the RRDPG has supported the
increase in the allocation towards labor intensive public works (LIPW) to 4.9 percent in
2012/13 which successfully reached about 590,000 poor households nationwide and
created job opportunities for a period of 48 days per years. In-line with these objectives,
the ratio of total LIPW related expenditure to total recurrent expenditure in the budget
increased from 1.5 percent in 2011/12, to about 4.9 percent in 2012/13 against the end of
program outcome indicator of 6.5 percent.




                                            14
(b) Protecting the poor and most vulnerable groups- Farm Input Subsidy Program

40.     The Farm Input Subsidy Program was also scaled up to enable cash strapped
and drought affected households to get access to cheap farm inputs and to engage in
productive income generating activities. The budgetary allocation to FISP as a share of
total recurrent expenditure increased to 14 percent in 2012/13 from 7.5 percent in
2011/12, superseding the program outcome indicator of 12 percent. Specifically, a total
of 1.5 million households, including extra 100,000 households from the south of the
country, accessed FISP fertilizer to safeguard their livelihoods. The availability of
subsidized fertilizer and seeds to poor farmers acted as a cushion as most farmers would
not have been able to afford fertilizer at a market rate of over MWK10,000 per 50kg,
whereas they were purchasing the same for MWK 500 per 50kg bag. The support
extended to households hard hit by a drought in the south (during the previous farming
cycle), allowing them to grow their own maize instead of relying on food aid.

(c) Improving transparency of delivery systems (FISP Procurement)

41.      Within the operation, the program also sought to address transparency in
FISP procurement. FISP Procurement is a long standing governance concern around
cost effectiveness and transparency. Within this operation, the objective was to
institutionalize procurement audits that were happening in an ad hoc manner. Despite a
directive being issued by the Ministry of Finance (at project appraisal) to the Auditor
General to incorporate FISP procurement audit in their work program, the audit has not
been done to date, and consequently the submission to Parliament of the report has not
been met. A number of factors have been identified as behind this outcome, chief of
which was the absence of the Auditor General, who was only appointed in June 2013 due
to delays in the recruitment process of confirmation in Parliament. Notwithstanding, the
GoM, with the assistance of the Bank is currently working on measures to improve
efficiency and value for money in the FISP through reforms in the procurement process.
This has entailed the revisions to the bid evaluation methodology for 2013/14 FISP,
which has helped the GoM make fiscal savings of close to US$20 million.

3.3.   Overall Outcome Rating

42.     Based on the combined assessment of achievement and relevance, the
outcome rating is satisfactory. Table 4 summarizes the ratings arrived at earlier. The
‘satisfactory’ outcome rating reflects the substantial degree to which objectives were
achieved and the substantial nature of the relevance of objectives, and design and
implementation.

3.4.   Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)    Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

43.     The operation anticipated positive poverty impacts through the
distributional effects emanating from better targeting of social assistance. The
program supported the scaling up of social protection interventions through the adoption
of the 2012/13 National Budget, which gave expenditure prioritization to social
protection programs. With the expansion of these programs the poor and the most
vulnerable segment of the Malawi’s population (close to 700,000 farming households)
was able to access the much needed farm inputs for food production and others were able
to earn their income through the public works, which among others, enabled them to
purchase farm inputs as well as meet their other basic needs. The timing of the unification
of the exchange rate in May 2012 also played an important role in the cushioning of the
farming families involved in tobacco faming (over 400,000), including women.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

44.   The RRDPG helped strengthen the petroleum price automatic adjustment
mechanism institutional framework.

(c)    Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

There were no beneficiary survey and/or stakeholder workshops


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
45. The risks that development outcomes or expected outcomes will not be
maintained or realized are moderate. This assessment takes into account both the
probability and the likely impact of threats to outcomes. It considers how these have been
mitigated in the operation’s design or by actions taken during its implementation. The
RRDPG program has been strong, with solid government ownership and prior actions
reflecting the GoM’s own reform agenda. The following individual criteria of risk has
been considered as it may affect realized/planned outcomes:

a)     Shortfalls in external financing risk is moderate. Successful implementation of
the reform agenda assumes a steady flow of external financing to the budget over a
medium term horizon (2012-2015). While the GoM benefitted from a surge in aid


                                            17
inflows, including program aid, during the implementation of the Program (2012/13),
there is some risk that these levels will not be sustained in 2013/14. The unearthing of
massive fraud and corruption in government which has translated into the loss of millions
of dollars in September 2013 has resulted in the suspension of aid by some development
partners. GoM has developed an action plan of measures intended to close the loop holes
that have been identified to have been exploited in this scandal. These measures are
intended to mitigate against this risk materializing, and indications at the time of the ICR
are that they may be sufficient to facilitate the unfreezing of aid in the second half of
FY 14.

b)      Political risk is substantial. By their very nature, the reforms carried with them
an inherent political risk. Given the history of reforms in Malawi, the risk of policy
reversals due to political considerations in an election year was always high. So far, the
current administration has remained strongly committed to the reforms despite the strong
criticism coming from various segments of the Malawi society calling for the reversal of
some of the policies (like the APM). With political commentators predicting a tight race
in the presidential race in 2014, the reforms remain vulnerable to future policy reversals.
Spending pressures are also mounting, including wage demands and other election related
spending, posing a risk of further fiscal loosening, which could affect the program
outcomes.

c)      Social tension risks are moderate. While the GoM has managed to avert violent
demonstrations, risks still remain, especially as the country remains vulnerable to weather
related shocks and seasonality of foreign exchange inflows, which could compromise
some of the gains of the reforms. Despite an overall nationwide good harvest, some areas
of the country suffered from prolonged dry-spells. A total of 1.4 million people (9.5% of
the population) have been assessed as food insecure and the figure could increase to
1.9 million. With support from WFP, the GoM has elaborated a food assistance plan that
would cost US$94 million. Development partners have pledged support to the efforts.

d)       Implementation capacity risk is moderate. The systemic problem of
institutional capacity in GoM continues to pose a risk to the reform program. So far, the
scaling up of social safety net programs has been smoothly implemented with support
from MASAF and IRLAD. Efforts to build capacity in the civil service are on-going.

e)      Fiduciary risk is substantial. The recent revelations of misappropriation of
public resources point to weak managerial accountability and public finance management
systems. The extent of this risk was not fully appreciated by the donor community until
the recent scandal. The risks are being mitigated through a strengthening of fiduciary
systems with the support of development partners; however, without a complete overhaul
of the system, nothing short of rolling out an ambitious public service reform agenda and
strengthening accountability/oversight institutions, governance risks will remain
significant over the near term.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1.   Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

(a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

46.     Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is satisfactory. The Bank’s
timely response to the Government’s request to support its bold reform program, helped
redirect the economy towards a stable economic path, away from an imminent deep
recession. The identification and design of the RRDPG were consistent with the CAS and
benefited from an in-depth analysis on the status of the economy. The Bank and
government were able to draw on timely and highly relevant analytical work in
developing specific program components. The high quality of Bank’s technical inputs
that supported the design of the overall program was appreciated by both the government
and the development partners. The fiduciary aspects assessed at the time of appraisal
were deemed adequate for the operation. The policy changes in the reform program
responded to the medium term challenges that the country faced at the time of the start of
the program, as well as short term challenges at the beginning of the operation. However,
the program was a bit over ambitious in assuming it could bring about meaningful
reforms around FISP procurement in an emergency situation.

47.      The design of this operation applied some of the lessons learned from Bank’s
previous (extensive) engagement with GoM and other stakeholders in the country. A
number of important lessons relevant for the design of the proposed RRDPG have
emerged from the CAS Completion Report and PRSC I-III ICR and were taken into
account in the development of the operation. In FY08, the Bank approved a PRSC DPO
series and this program provided two important lessons which greatly influenced the
preparation of the RRDPG. The first lesson concerns ownership. Like the PRSCI-III, the
RRDPG supported the Government’s own reform program to ensure commitment for
reforms. It recognizes the importance of supporting an agenda which is Government
owned at the highest level. Secondly, the design of the operation was mindful of the risk
that progress tends to be slower in reform areas where the political economy context is
critical, yet not adequately understood. Therefore the design incorporated evidence-based
analysis and engagement at a Cabinet level to help pave the way for reforms supported by
this operation.

48.      Assessments of relevant aspects were correct. The program correctly evaluated
institutional, fiduciary and environmental aspects. None of these evaluations was proven
wrong during the implementation. The risk assessment was relevant and mitigating
factors were largely adequate. Poverty and social development aspects were considered
fully as one of the main components of the program was related to inclusion and


                                           19
increased opportunities to empower the vulnerable to participate in economic activities.
The M&E framework was sound and assessment of the political economy was correct.

(b)    Quality of Supervision

49.    Quality of supervision is satisfactory. The Bank conducted periodic supervision
missions where the focus of supervisions was on the development objectives and
outcomes indicators. Specifically, progress on the program was being tracked during the
annual CABS Review between the Government and its budget support development
partners. The Bank also participated in the IMF Article IV and quarterly ECF Review
missions which helped better understanding the debt sustainability situation and
macroeconomic conditions.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

50.     Overall Bank performance was satisfactory. The RRDPG was a well-designed
and implemented operation; hence Bank performance for quality at entry is rated
satisfactory and satisfactory for supervision.


5.2.   Borrower Performance

(a)    Government Performance

51.     The Government’s performance is satisfactory. Given the strength of the
reforms, and the uncertain and volatile environment in which they were implemented, the
performance of the government was satisfactory. The program was very ambitious and
bold; and as such could not have succeeded without strong ownership, leadership, and
commitment of the Government to the reform agenda. The performance on fiduciary
arrangements is considered moderately satisfactory as the Government continued to work
closely with partners to strengthen its PFM systems. The development of the monitoring
and evaluation framework for the RRDPG was also satisfactory as the list of monitoring
indicators was realistic and the information was readily available at the time of this ICR.

(b)    Implementing Agency Performance

52.     In this operation, the Government and implementing agency cannot be
distinguished separately.

53.    The Ministry of Finance was the driver and coordinating body for the reform
program and was the Bank’s official counterpart in the implementation of the
program. The MoF played an effective role in convening line Ministries, Departments
and Agencies (MDAs) to discuss the specifics of each policy actions, including
commenting on the draft policy document and to agree on a timeframe for their
completion. The authorities partnered with several development partners to secure
technical assistance and analytical work to fill the knowledge gaps in some areas in the


                                            20
implementation of the program in order to mitigate against their weak capacity in the
implementation of the reform program. Relationship and coordination between the GoM
and other partners is effective; in that the GoM also played a critical role in ensuring that
the DPs collaborate in their engagement with the Government and complement each
other’s work for the benefit of the country.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower’s Performance

54.    Overall government’s performance is rated satisfactory, in line with the ratings
for Government performance and Program outcomes. The GoM demonstrated a clear
ownership of the program and was very instrumental in keeping the momentum of the
reforms to support the economic recovery.


6. Lessons Learned
The key lessons learned from this program pertain to: (i) Strong Government
leadership, and political will (ownership and commitment), (ii) alignment with
Government priorities and incremental approach in dialogue, (iii) strong coordination
with DPs, (iv) Complementary between investment projects and DPOs for sustainability
of reforms, (v) Inability of DPOs to address deep-seated governance problems.

55.     Strong Government leadership and political will drives successful reforms.
Difficult structural economic reforms stand a better chance of succeeding where the
authorities have ownership and commitment at the highest levels to the reform process. In
Malawi, the government’s strong political will, as exemplified by the self-imposition of
hard and bold economic reforms despite intrinsic political risks associated with such
reforms, was key to the overall success of this operation.

56.      Alignment with Government priorities and incremental dialogue are
necessary ingredients for rapid policy changes. Alignment with Government priorities
and incremental dialogue provides valuable weight to immediate and short term policy
exigencies while building consensus for broader and bolder reforms. The incremental
dialogue approach essentially helps the Government to identify and articulate country
priorities and as such build the ground in terms of substance and sequencing for
subsequent operations. Strong knowledge base helps to identify priority areas of reforms
as well as specific measures to be implemented. Alignment and incremental dialogue also
helps in designing pragmatic time bound prior actions and the setting realistic targets.
Agreement on the set of results and continued dialogue motivate agencies, but more
importantly, the champions to remain focus on the reform agenda. Going forward, the
combination of developing strong knowledge base to prioritize the areas of reforms and
incremental dialogue in politically-sensitive areas should be maintained. This
combination ensures ownership of reforms, especially at sector level.

57.    Strong coordination with DPs avoids duplication and harmonize results
framework. There has been a positive impact from the highly harmonized policy
dialogue across donors providing budget support. Government’s capability to take


                                             21
leadership in coordinating development assistance from the donor community has been
instrumental. The ability of the team to work in close collaboration with DPs resulted in
harmonizing results framework through common policy dialogue with the Government.
Close coordination has proven to be an effective way to support budget planning and
execution. Building on technical support across sectors for capacity building and
analytical work by DPs contributed to achievement of the objectives of the program.
Dissemination of ESWs helped to strengthen momentum for reforms and build allies.
This will help to avoid duplication and build allies to accelerate the reform agenda.

58.      Complementarity between Investment Project and DPOs generate mutual
leverage for achieving development objectives and for ensuring sustainability of
reforms. This has been particularly well illustrated by the reforms related to the scaling
up of social safety net program whereby the DPO provided the policy framework and
financing incentive to pursue the reforms, while the investment program translated these
into life changing income generating activities for the poor. The design of the operation
as single tranche DPO proved to be a suitable instrument for the timely response to the
client’s needs. It supported effectively to the needs of the country by providing timely
response based on clearly established prior actions.

59.     Inability of DPOs to address deep-seated governance problems. The choice of
instrument to address a deep seated governance issue was not appropriate. The DPO was
supporting a process and not the outcomes in an area with vested political interests. A
vital lesson learned could be that in order to facilitate such deep reforms, future
operations should consider focusing on supporting results rather than finalizing a stage in
the process as was the case for the FISP procurement audit.

            Annex 2. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

      Introduction
      1.       During project appraisal in 2012, Her Excellency Dr. Joyce Banda, who came to
      office after the sudden death of President Bingu wa Mutharika in April 2012, had just
      inherited an economy with a difficult macroeconomic and governance environment
      characterized by severe fiscal and external imbalances and with budget support
      suspended by the Development Partners (DPs). It is against this background that GoM
      urgently requested the World Bank to support the on-going macroeconomic stabilisation
      program as well as measures which will mitigate the impacts of the bold and wide
      ranging reforms which are currently being implemented. The Bank responded by
      providing the Rapid Response Development Policy Grant (RRDPG) amounting to SDR
      33.20 million (U$ 50 million) to GoM. The development objectives of the RRDPG were
      to support (i) the achieving and maintaining macroeconomic stability, and restoring the
      functioning of a market-based economy to ensure a quick growth rebound; and
      (ii) protecting the poor and most vulnerable groups in the short run while improving the
      transparency of delivery systems. To this end, a Results Framework was agreed between
      the Bank and GoM to assess the performance of the Project.

      Assessment of the outcomes
(a)      Recent macroeconomic developments

      2.      GoM took bold measures to restore fiscal stability and enhance social protection
      from May 2012, including devaluation of the Malawi Kwacha, exchange rate floatation,
      monetary policy and fiscal tightening and the adoption of an automatic fuel price
      adjustment mechanism. GoM continues to implement adjustment measures adopted since
      May 2012 to address the macroeconomic challenges facing the country. The adjustment
      measures have yielded positive results. The availability of foreign exchange for
      importation of strategic inputs has improved and fuel supplies have normalized. Credit
      lines that were frozen during the crisis have been restored. Nonetheless, Malawi’s
      economic recovery remains fragile. The impact of the devaluation of the kwacha has been
      steeper than anticipated which coupled with the adoption of the automatic price
      adjustment mechanism on petroleum products has led to the high spike in inflation.

      3.       Real GDP in 2012 grew by 1.9 percent compared to 4.3 percent in 2011 mainly on
      account of slower recovery in the agriculture, fishing and manufacturing sectors than
      initially anticipated. The agriculture sector performance was affected by the drought that
      hit the southern parts of the country. The manufacturing sector suffered from high input
      prices resulting from the devaluation and general inflation as well as fuel and foreign
      exchange shortages at the start of the year.

      4.     Meanwhile, inflationary pressures in the economy surged. The March 2013
      headline inflation stood at 36.4 percent from 17.3 percent in May 2012, higher than the
      ECF programme projection of 22.4%. Inflation is being driven by rising food prices
      (food accounts for 80 % of the CPI basket) and escalating transport and utility prices. The


                                                  24
end of period inflation is projected to decline to 14.2% as the food situation normalizes
and growth rebounds. The Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) maintained the 25 percent
policy rate as of May 2013 to ease inflationary pressures.

5.      On the fiscal side, Government of Malawi has exercised fiscal restraint as the
central Government Budget Operations for the 2012/2013 financial year was on track
compared to the preceding year. This was mainly due to the resuscitation in the
manufacturing sector following the availability of foreign exchange and fuel and
increased budget support from development partners following the restoration of donor
confidence. Consequently, the overall fiscal deficit reduced to 0.8 percent of GDP in
2012/2013 from 8.4 percent in the previous fiscal year. A combination of high domestic
tax revenue and surge in donor grant disbursements resulted in higher than program
targets for first half of that fiscal year. The Government of Malawi was and remains
committed to implementing austerity measures, including stringent controls of travel and
transport. However, fiscal pressures mounted in 2012/13 on account of the Kwacha’s
continued depreciation and inflation which increased the cost of goods and services,
especially imports. In this respect, during the 2012/2013 Mid-Year review, the budget
was revised from MWK 408 billion to MWK 476 billion on account of the problems
mentioned herein.

6.     The Third Review of the IMF ECF programme was completed by the IMF in
June 2013. During this review, Government reached a staff level understanding with the
IMF where overall performance on the third review was deemed satisfactory. However,
the IMF Board is yet to meet to make the final decision.

(b)    Social Protection and Human Development

7.      The implementation of the Farm Inputs Program (FISP) for the 2012/13
agricultural season progressed well. In total, the programme distributed 154,400 metric
tons of Fertilisers comprising 77,200 metric tons of Urea and 77, 200 metric tons of NPK
to 1,544,400 farm families across the country at a subsidized price of K500 per bag. By
the end of December, 2012, 99.9% of the fertilisers had already been distributed to all the
depots across the country for distribution to the intended families. Under the program,
Government of Malawi distributed additional 4,400 metric tons of fertilisers to 44,400
additional beneficiaries identified by the ministry of agriculture. Under the same
program, a total of 1,570 metric tons of Legume Seed was procured from Seed Traders
Association of Malawi (STAM) for distribution to over 100,000 farmers across the
country. However, it must be noted that provision for the Farm Inputs Subsidy
Programme (FISP) has been revised upwards from the original estimate of K40.6 billion
to K55 billion. This is due to increase in the number of beneficiaries and the Kwacha’s
continued depreciation.

8.     The Government of Malawi is using the Social Support Policy (SSP) and National
Social Support Programme (NSSP) to cushion poor people against the effect of
devaluation of the Kwacha and subsequent floatation of the same. Under the NSSP, the

                                            25
Social Cash Transfer Programme is reaching only 35% of vulnerable groups in 7 districts
out of 28, and full coverage in only 3 of the 7 districts. The Government of Malawi also
plans to scale up coverage of the Social Cash Transfer Programme from 7 districts in
2012 to 14 districts in 2013/14. In addition, the Malawi National Support Programme
which operationalizes the SSP was approved by the National Steering Committee in
March 2013. It is envisaged that this approval will expedite disbursements of pledged
donor funding towards the social support programme which were awaiting the approval.

(c)    Evaluation of the Borrower’s Own Performance
9.      The GoM demonstrated a clear ownership of the program and its emphasis to stay
the course of the reforms supported the economic recovery and kept the program alive.
The GoM successfully managed to reduce the fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP from
8.4 percent of GDP in the previous year to 0.8 percent of GDP in the 2012/2013 fiscal
year. Further, a domestic repayment equivalent to 1.5 percent of GDP was made within
the year (an ECF condition). Likewise, GoM increased the ratio of total fertilizer and
seeds subsidy related expenditure to total recurrent expenditure from 12% in July 2012 to
14% in June 2013. The latter implies a much bigger and wider safety net to the very poor
people who could not afford farm inputs due to the devaluation and subsequent floatation
of the Kwacha. However, the devaluation and floatation of the Kwacha was a source of a
major fiscal pressure on the budget implementation as strategic expenditures had been
budgeted on the previously overvalued local currency.

(d)    Evaluation of the Performance of the Bank

10.    The Bank’s RRDPG was delivered in GoM’s preferred aid modality of budget
support and was well aligned with the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy II and
the subsequent Economic Recovery Plan. Moreover, the Bank’s decision to design the
operation as single tranche DPO proved to be a suitable instrument for the timely
response to GoMs needs.


(e)    Proposed arrangements for future operations

11.     Budget Support still remains GoM’s preferred aid modality. Responding to this,
the Bank approved a new programmatic Development Policy Operation which was
launched in FY2012/13. Going forward, assuming all things constant, the second and
third single tranches are expected to be activated in the subsequent years.

(f)    Comments on the ICR

12.   Generally, the ICRR is a fair reflection on GoM performance vis-a-vis
implementation of the policy reforms that were instituted in the 2012/2013 fiscal year.
