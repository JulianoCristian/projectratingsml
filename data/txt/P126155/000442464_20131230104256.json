to development outcome was\n            moderate, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the government's strong political will, as exemplified\n            by the self-imposition of hard and bold economic reforms\n            despite intrinsic political risks associated with such\n            reforms, was key to the overall success of this operation.\n            Alignment with government priorities and incremental\n            dialogue are necessary ingredients for rapid policy changes.\n            Strong coordination with development partners (DPs) avoids\n            duplication and harmonize results framework. Complementarity\n            between investment project and development policy operations\n            (DPOs) generates mutual leverage for achieving development\n            objectives and for ensuring sustainability of reforms. In\n            order to facilitate such deep reforms, future operations\n            should consider focusing on supporting results rather than\n            finalizing a stage in the process as was the case for the\n            Farm Input Subsidy Program (FISP) procurement audit."}, "docdt": "2013-12-25T00:00:00Z"}
