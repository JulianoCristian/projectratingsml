University Development\n            Project will develop Indonesia's capacity to train its\n            own university teachers and researchers. This will be\n            accomplished by: (a) development of new graduate-level\n            programs in selected fields of study and research; (b)\n            initiation of five specialized undergraduate fields of study\n            which are currently not available in Indonesia; and (c)\n            strengthening of overall university planning and management.\n            The project will finance about 845 graduate fellowships;\n            about 1,000 research grants; about 3,000 differing prototype\n            instructional materials; facilities and equipment for 16\n            inter-university graduate education centers; and related\n            technical assistance. The main benefits of the project will\n            be to increase the proportion of university teachers holding\n            advanced degrees from 15% to 35%; improve the quality of\n            educational materials, teaching methods and research; and\n            increase management capacity for administration and planning\n            of higher education."}, "docdt": "1985-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
