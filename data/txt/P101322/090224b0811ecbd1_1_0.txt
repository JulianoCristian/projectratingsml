While keeping the project development objective, the project was restructured in October 2011 to: (i) revise some of the results indicators and target values to better align with
GDTAC activities and reflect what can realistically be observed and measured at exit; (ii) streamline components to focus on project activities with the most value-added to the project
development objective; (iii) revise the financing plan to reflect the increased requirements for the Customs Modernization component and consequent reallocation of funds across
components; (iv) reallocate the Credit proceeds to accommodate the revised activities and financing plan; (vi) extend by nine months the closing date of the Credit (from October 31,
2011 to June 30, 2012) to facilitate achievement of desired outcomes at exit. Accordingly, the procurement plan was restructured.
