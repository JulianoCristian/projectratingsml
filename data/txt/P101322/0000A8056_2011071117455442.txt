                         Implementation Status Overview
                         An implementation support mission took place between May 23-27, 2011. The team held consultations with the authorities, the project management staff as well as with the
                         beneficiaries of the project with focus on the potential restructuring of the project in light of the Government's request for extension of the IDA Credit's closing date from October 31,
                         2011 to June 30, 2012. As of May 14, 2011, total IDA disbursements amounted to about US$1 million or approximately 54% of the Credit, unchanged from last mission in November
                         2010. On the other hand, total commitments under the project for all sources of financing (IDA, EU Cofinancing Grant and counterpart funds) have now reached USD1,420,000 - a
                         40% increase from last mission. However, there is little progress noted towards achieving the development objectives and associated outcome indicators due to slow
                         implementation on the ground.
