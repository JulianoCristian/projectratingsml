                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER

SUMMARY
     1. This Restructuring Paper proposes to introduce changes in the GD TAC Project
(IDA-44000, P101322 with EU Cofinancing Grant TF099140) and any accompanying
amendments to the project’s legal documents. The proposed changes to the project are:
(i) revision of some of the results indicators and target values to better align with Project
activities and reflect what can realistically be observed and measured at exit; (ii)
streamline components to focus on project activities with the most value-added to the
Project Development Objective; (iii) revision of the financing plan to reflect the increased
requirements for the Customs Modernization component and consequent reallocation of
funds across components; (iv) reallocation of Credit proceeds to accommodate revised
activities and financing plan; (v) a nine month extension of the closing date (from
October 31, 2011 to June 30, 2012) to facilitate achievement of desired outcomes at exit;
and (vi) update of the procurement plan. The original Project Development Objective
would be maintained.


PROJECT STATUS
    2. Soon after the project was approved by the Board, it was confronted by several
challenges beyond its control that led to a significant delay in implementation start-up.
The project’s effectiveness was delayed by almost a year from Board approval as a
consequence of the 2008 elections and the subsequent change in administration in the
country. Thereafter, the appointment of the project manager took another six months
from effectiveness. The project was officially launched in October 2009, having lost
almost 18 months of implementation time. Thereafter, significant procurement activities
were initiated with the ASYCUDA World contract (equivalent to about 30% of the IDA
Credit) signed in April 2010. To date, procurement of additional activities has advanced,
but there is little progress towards achieving the project’s development objectives due to
slow implementation on the ground. While the Implementation Progress (IP) rating
remains Moderately Satisfactory, the progress toward Development Objectives (DO)
rating was recently downgraded to Moderately Unsatisfactory.

    3. Under the Customs Modernization component, the ASYCUDA World
implementation was launched in June 2010, but progress in its roll-out slipped by about
four to five months due to delays in the availability of counterpart funds that would allow
for procurement of the required ICT equipment. Under the Tax Administration
component, the GoG decision to proceed with the implementation of the SIGTAS
upgrade was recently made and the contract is now being finalized. With respect to the
Modernization of Investment Promotion component, the National Investment
Promotion Strategy was approved in August 2011 by Cabinet for adoption and


                                             4
implementation. The laboratory equipment for the Export Strategy component has been
procured and is awaiting full installation and training of personnel.

    4. While there is a lack of tangible evidence vis-à-vis the planned outcomes due to
slow implementation, this is not due to a lack of proactivity by Project Management or
insufficient GoG commitment. During the implementation support mission in May 2011,
the Bank noted a 40% increase in commitments within a six-month period. The main
reason for the delays is the 1.5 years lost at project start-up.


PROPOSED CHANGES
   Results/indicators

    5. While the Project Development Objective remains unchanged, some of the results
indicators and their target values would be revised to better align with project activities
and to reflect what can realistically be observed and measured at exit. In particular, the
administrative efficiency ratio indicators would be dropped as these cannot be
realistically observed at exit given the delayed implementation of the relevant project
activities. These changes are described in detail in Annex 1 of this Restructuring Paper.

   Components

    6. Given the delay in implementation and the actual costs of critical inputs, project
activities have been streamlined to focus on activities that are critical and have the most
value-added for achieving the Project Development Objective. Accordingly, the
following changes to the project’s components would be introduced:

   •   With the success of the Customs Modernization component dependent on the ICT
       equipment being put in place to facilitate the roll-out of the ASYCUDA World
       upgrade, funds from both the IDA Credit and the EU Cofinancing Grant would be
       reallocated to finance this equipment.
   •   The Tax Administration Modernization component would be reduced
       significantly to finance only two sub-components: (2.1) improving the
       organization and management of the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) (except
       the activity related to developing a three-year corporate plan for the IRD which
       was not among the deliverables included in the contracted commitments for the
       sub-component) and (2.5) upgrading the information technology within the IRD.
       All other sub-components will be dropped as they are being pursued under other
       funding sources (e.g, technical assistance from CARTAC). Savings from the
       cancelled activities would finance an increased requirement for the upgrade of tax
       administration information technology systems and some reallocated to the
       Customs Modernization component.
   •   The consultancy services inputs for the Modernization of Investment Promotion
       component were consolidated into a single contract that allowed for some savings
       to be reallocated to the Customs component.


                                            5
      •   Under the Implementation of Export Strategy component, the procurement of
          specialized equipment for the Bureau of Standards required additional resources.
          Consequently, other inputs were scaled down taking into account the remaining
          implementation period. This allowed for some savings that could be allocated to
          the Customs component.
      •   Under the Project Management component, actual costs of contracts issued also
          provided for some savings that could be reallocated to the Customs component.

      Financing

    7. As discussed above, the financing requirements for the Customs Modernization
component increased due to the updated cost of the equipment for the roll-out of the
ASYCUDA World upgrade. Likewise, an adjustment to the original PAD estimates on
the US$ equivalent of the EU cofinancing grant would be necessary given current
exchange rate levels and the need to correctly reflect the EU cofinancing grant amount
available to the Government of Grenada under the IDA-administered Trust Fund
(TF071138). Accordingly, the total project cost would be revised to US$2.8 million
(from US$2.815 million) and reallocation across components would be necessary and is
facilitated by savings from other components. The revised financing plan for the project
is provided below:

    8. Presently, project activities are being pursued with two external funding sources –
the IDA Credit and an EU Cofinancing Grant. The Grant is primarily co-financing the
on-going consultancy contracts for ASYCUDA World and investment promotion strategy
as well as the equipment requirements for ASYCUDA World and Bureau of Standards.
However, the Grant has a final closing date of October 31, 2011. Accordingly, to ensure
that all remaining activities are adequately financed, to accommodate revised activities
and financing plan, and to provide for flexibility in disbursements moving forward given
the EU Cofinancing Grant is not yet fully disbursed, this restructuring proposes to
reallocate the IDA Credit proceeds as per the table below:

           Project

   •   Procurement

   9. As a consequence of the changes in project financing, a revised procurement plan
as of September 2011 has been prepared that includes all sources of financing and
provides a realistic timeline for all remaining procurement activities (See Annex 2.)

       •   Closing date

    10. The IDA Credit closing date would be extended by nine months from October 31,
2011 to June 30, 2012 to facilitate completion of critical project activities and satisfactory
achievement of desired outcomes at exit. This is the first extension of the Credit’s closing
date.

   •   Implementation schedule

   11. A revised action plan and implementation schedule has been prepared and agreed
between the PCU and the Bank task team. In particular, a strict timeline for the
ASYCUDA World implementation has been agreed and would be monitored very closely
by both the GoG through its project Steering Committee and the Bank so as not to
compromise the extension.

APPRAISAL SUMMARY
    12. The restructuring would not alter the conclusions of the original economic and
financial appraisal of the project. The GoG has budgeted for required counterpart funds,
which attests to their strong commitment to the project and their own assessment that the
project remains economically and financially viable. The restructuring raises no new
social or environmental issues. It does not trigger new risks or exceptions to Bank policy.
A recent additional benefit of the project is that it would help position Grenada to benefit
more intensively from the recently-initiated program for Supporting Economic
Management in the Caribbean (SEMCAR), a major regional initiative financed by the
Government of Canada.

Project Development Objective (PDO) is to: (i) improve the efficiency and effectiveness of customs; (ii) improve the efficiency of tax administration and decrease the transactions costs of
paying taxes and consequently increase tax compliance; (iii) modernize investment promotion; and (iv) enhance the GoG’s support to the export sector through improving access to trade
information and strengthening the capacity of the Bureau of Standards to provide conformity assessments and quality assurance.

Notes:
(1) The figures entered for Training of GIDC Staff and Training of
Bureau of Standards personnel includes for both logistical and
consultant services. However, due to the fact that I am using a table
with formulas I do not have the flexibility to change it to IC or QCBS




(2) Training Attachment for Bureau of Standards Personnel -
procurement method should be LCS. There isn’t any flexibility in the
formulas to add that procurement method thus it is reflected under bid
number LCS. This line items would be partly funded by IDA & GOG -
IDA 10,000 & GOD 10,000



(3) Customer Service Training would be carried out by an Individual
Consultant. However, due to my inability to change the formula, I
have indicated the method to be used in under the Bid Number
column. Hope this will suffice.
