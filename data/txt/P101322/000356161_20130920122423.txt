1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
During project preparation Grenada was recovering from two disastrous hurricanes (Ivan
in 2004 and Emily in 2005), which caused damages equivalent to approximately 220
percent of the country’s GDP. The economy contracted by 5.7 percent in 2004 following
a robust growth of 7 percent in 2003. Exports plummeted, reflecting the devastation to
the agricultural sector and the nutmeg industry – an important export item – was hard hit.
The volume of exports declined by 26 percent in 2005, while imports grew by 22.6
percent as a result of strong demand for building materials for reconstruction. The current
account of the balance of payments deteriorated, pushing the deficit from 13.5 to 37.1
percent of GDP from 2004 to 2005.

1.1 Context at Appraisal
A strong inflow of grants, which reached 11 percent of GDP in 2005, protected Grenada
from deterioration of its fiscal position immediately after the hurricanes. However, the
public debt stood at a high mark of 110.3 percent of GDP in 2005. Slowing in the inflow
of external grants to 8 percent of GDP in 2006 resulted in difficulties for the Government
to sustain the public expenditure and especially capital spending at the level of previous
years. Facing growing fiscal pressures, the Government formulated an economic reform
program for 2006-2008 focused on achieving macroeconomic stability and enhancing
growth and poverty alleviation. Along with the measures to restore fiscal and debt
sustainability, reduce vulnerabilities, and reduce poverty, the program had a goal of
promoting sustained high economic growth through improving the investment climate.

The Government program was supported by the IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility since April 2006. However, the Government faced challenges with implementing
this program because of the lower than projected tax collection and higher than projected
public expenditure, caused by higher utility costs and increased transfers to households.
Moreover, public sector growth was hampered by governance weaknesses, including, as
highlighted in the 2007 Doing Business Survey, relatively weak performance in: (i)
starting a business; (ii) dealing with licenses; (iii) registering property; (iv) paying taxes;
(v) trading across borders; (vi) enforcing contracts; and (vii) closing a business. The
Government demonstrated willingness to address these weaknesses by modernizing the
company registration and improving start up business procedures through the Public
Sector Modernization Technical Assistance Credit (Credit No 41370- GRD) financed by
the World Bank.

Additionally, the Government identified strategic areas focused on improving the
business environment, including: (i) strengthening Customs capacity in risk management
and reducing the processing time of exports and imports; (ii) strengthening tax
administration through upgrading information systems and developing planning capacity;
(iii) facilitating trade through provision of adequate trade information and building
capacity for providing quality assurance for export goods; and (iv) strengthening
investment promotion capacity.



                                              1
The World Bank’s 2008 CAS Progress Report 1 supported initiatives aimed at (i)
stimulating growth and improving competitiveness, (ii) reducing unemployment, and (iii)
modernizing the public sector to improve efficiency. The lack of fiscal space to address
development needs in Grenada, the clarity of the Government’s objectives in supporting
the private sector-led growth through strengthening institutions that facilitate trade and
investments, and the adequacy with the CAS framework were the key elements for
supporting the Bank’s decision to provide a technical assistance credit to the Government
of Grenada. The Bank IDA Credit of US$1.9 million equivalent was supplemented by a
grant of Euro 500,000 provided by the European Commission to finance the activities
aimed at strengthening institutions that would improve the business environment in
Grenada.


1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
The project development objectives were (i) to improve the efficiency and effectiveness
of Customs; (ii) to improve the efficiency of tax administration and decrease transaction
costs of paying taxes and consequently increase tax compliance; (iii) to enhance the
Government's support for exports through improving access to trade information and the
strengthening of the capacity of the Bureau of Standards to provide conformity
assessment and quality assurance; and (iv) to modernize investment promotion.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
 On October 7, 2011 the project was restructured (type II restructuring) without amending
the Project Development Objective. Some of the result indicators were changed to better
align expected results with project interventions that were re-focused to maximize value
added to the PDO. The revised result framework is presented in Table 1, below.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The primary project target group includes key public sector institutions that contribute to
improving the environment for private sector-led growth. These include: the Customs
Department, the Inland Revenue Department, the Grenada Industrial Development
Corporation, the Bureau of Standards, and the Trade Office of the Ministry of
Environment, Foreign Trade and Export Development. The broader beneficiary circle
includes the Grenada Chamber of Commerce, the Ministry of Finance, Planning,
Economy, Energy and Co-operatives, investors, exporters, and tax payers. Improvements
in trade and investments through better targeted policies, more transparent and efficient
institutions, clear and user-friendly procedures for approvals of investment applications
and clearance of trade will benefit the economy in general and entrepreneurs with interest
to trade and invest in Grenada.

These components were aimed at achieving the following results:

1. Custom Modernization
Objective: To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Customs through
modernization of the administration.
Intermediate Objectives: (i) improving customs systems and procedures; (ii) upgrading
information technology; and (iii) capacity building of management and staff in Customs.
2. Tax Administration Modernization
Objective: To modernize critical areas of tax administration to increase the overall
efficiency and effectiveness of tax administration and decrease the transaction cost of
paying taxes, and thus increase the level of tax compliance.
Intermediate Objectives: (i) improving the registration process for taxpayers; (ii)
cleaning–up the taxpayer registry; (iii) strengthening the detection of non-registered
taxpayers; (iv) improving taxpayer services; and (v) examining the feasibility of using
Tax Compliance Certificates.
3. Modernization of Investment Promotion
Objective: to modernize investment promotion in Grenada through the strengthening of
the strategic and institutional environment for attracting investment into Grenada.
Intermediate Objectives: (i) preparing an investment promotion strategy; (ii)
implementing the Investment Promotion Strategy for Grenada; (iii) establishing an
Investment Facilitation Network; and (iv) achieving institutional strengthening to
enhance preparedness to process investment allowances.
4. Implementing Export Strategy
Objective: implementing the comprehensive export strategy of 2006.
Intermediate Objectives: (i) improving access to trade information; and (ii) strengthening
the Bureau of Standards.
5. Project Management


                                             5
Objective: managing contractual, financial and procurement aspects of the project;
supporting the project Steering Committee by monitoring results, including conducing
client surveys.

1.6 Revised Components

The components remained the same as above, with a reallocation of funds from all
sources (IDA Credit, EU Grant and Government Counterpart Co-financing). The Tax
Administration Modernization Component was significantly reduced and refocused to
support two sub-components: (i) improving the organization and management of the
Inland Revenue Department (IRD); and (ii) upgrading the information technology within
the IRD. The reason for the reduction of the scope Tax Administration Modernization
Component was based on two pragmatic considerations: (i) a possibility to benefit from a
newly approved Regional Bank-administered SEMCAR Program that supports strategic
planning and institutional strengthening of the tax administration function in the
Caribbean states; and (ii) the need to increase budget for implementation of the customs
system’s upgrade within the limited IDA envelope. The Customs Modernization
Component was quite advanced at that stage, and initiated information system upgrade
was critical to achieving measurable improvements in customs performance and trade
facilitation. The Bank team explored options to attract additional financing from the
contributing donor, the European Union, but this was not successful due to financial
planning constrains. Savings were identified through consolidation of activities under
other components as well, however, without significantly impacting the attainment of
planned results.


1.7 Other significant changes

The project restructuring (of type II) approved on October 7, 2011 addressed the
following three issues: (i) the extension of the project closing date by nine months to
allow for the completion of the main project activities, such as the upgrade of the
information technology systems in the Customs and the Inland Revenue Department; (ii)
the revision of the results indicators to align them to better reflect areas over which the
project had reasonable control and to remove the indicators to which the project was not
contributing (such as the reduction of cost of tax and customs administration as a share of
the revenue collected); and (iii) the reallocation of funds to reflect the actual higher costs
of inputs for customs modernization. After implementation of ASYCUDA World
significant improvements in services provided to the training community have been
achieved, such as reduction of time for custom clearance, automated processing of
customs proceedings, real time information on the status of clearance. These anticipated
improvements justified the strategic choice for funds reallocation in order to achieve
results contributing to the Project Development Objective.
The initial cost estimates for the project activities were lower than actual costs. No
contingency funds were reserved at design to account for rising prices. The total actual
project financing was equivalent to US$2.766 million, comprising the following
contributions from three sources: IDA, EU and the Government of Grenada.

As seen from Table 2, the project budget was amended during restructuring to
accommodate for the implementation of the upgrade of the Customs Information
Communication Technology (ICT) system to the latest web-based version of ASYCUDA
World (AW). However, increasing the allocation for Component 1 by 34 percent was not
sufficient to cover the costs of the equipment for relevant offices, including hardware
(computers, servers, and network equipment). To cover the financial gap, in parallel to
the project, the Government contributed an additional US$287,392 through direct
procurement by using government procedures. Although the main functionality and the
core modules of ASYCUDA were implemented during the project, there is still an
outstanding task of ensuring that relevant agencies, such as Statistics Office, Internal
Revenue Department, Health and Agriculture authorities use the system. Physical
connections have been put in place, and the training activities to access and operate the
ASUCYDA World System are ongoing. The Customs Department will require support
to assure an adequate access of these agencies to the system in order to fully automate
customs procedures.

Reallocation of funds caused some cancellations or reductions in the scope of activities in
other components, namely, reductions in the scope of training for classification of export
goods and in the financing for establishing a network for investment promotion, as well
as abandoning the services of a long-term tax consultant.

Regretfully, planned project financing was insufficient for attaining ambitious project
objectives. Limited financing led to a substantial reduction in the scope of the SIGTAS
upgrade for the tax administration. While the planned audit module, as envisaged by the
project, was developed, installed and made operational in the Inland Revenue Department
(IRD), the new module created much higher requirements for server performance. In the
absence of sufficient resources, the IRD abandoned other important system upgrades of
SIGTAS. As a result, this impacted the concurrent access of IRD officials to the system,
thus resulting in inefficiencies in IRD performance. The Bank team decided to use
SEMCAR Program’s resources to support necessary improvements in tax administration
information system.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

                                            7
In 2007, the first Doing Business report was issued for the OECS 2, identifying problems
in the business environment that constrained growth. The Bank team used this report as
an entry point for discussing measures for improving growth through trade facilitation,
attraction of investments and improving the business environment in Grenada with the
Government. The Government identified the needs to modernize their Customs and Tax
Offices to ensure effective and efficient revenue collection, as well as address such
weaknesses as the lack of conformity assessment for exported goods, and the lack of
information for investors, lengthy procedures for clearing investment requests which
hindered trade, as well as weaknesses in supporting investment and revenue collection in
Grenada. During preparation, the Bank team coordinated with the Customs and Tax
advisors of the IMF’s Caribbean Technical Assistance Center (CARTAC) to identify
priority areas for technical assistance.

 The project design was informed by the lessons from similar project implementation in
Grenada and other Caribbean Countries (particularly Dominica, which was implementing
a similar project). The project design focused on capitalizing on strong reform ownership,
achieving early results, nurturing private and public sector partnership, and supporting
institutional capacity strengthening through direct involvement of related officials -
reform champions in implementation. Given the limited IDA borrowing envelope for the
OECS, the Bank took a strategic approach which involved leveraging additional
resources for technical assistance from such sources as the European Union and the
Government of Grenada. In addition to the SDR1.2 million of IDA credit, the European
Union contributed EUR0.5 million for project implementation.

The project design identified two operation-specific high risks: one related to the
project’s multi-sector nature; and the second related to implementation capacity and
sustainability. The first risk was mitigated through the design of an implementing
structure that relied on the leadership of the Ministry of Finance and was supported by
the Steering Committee, and on ownership from technical teams of the beneficiary
departments. These arrangements served well, as the Steering Committee through its
monthly meetings, prepared by the Project Manager, provided good supervision,
direction and the coordination necessary to keep the beneficiary departments focused on
the achievement of results. Similarly, the second high level risk (related to the capacity of
multiple beneficiary departments) was mitigated through consultancy support and the
effective functioning of the Steering Committee. The risks of insufficient financing of the
project activities, as well as the risk of slow mobilization of the project implementing
structure, caused in part by the electoral change in government, were not identified at the
project design stage. These factors proved to play a significant, negative role in the ability
of the Government of Grenada to complete all the planned activities in full and in time.

The arrangements for government counterpart funding through the counterpart fund
accounts were not analyzed or described in detail at the design stage and no conditions

(covenants) regarding the government counterpart financing obligations were agreed
upon. This caused problems with financing project activities, as in the wake of the global
financial and economic crisis the Government co-financed US$14,741 worth of project
activities, or only 6% of the planned US$250,000. However, facing the need to
implement the ASYCUDA World upgrade, the Government directly financed
US$ 287,392 for works and hardware purchase, as part of the government contractual
obligation with the vendor in order to enable system implementation. This amount,
equivalent to 115 percent of the pledged amount, was not originally planned under the
project design and thus was not included in the project procurement plan.

2.2 Implementation

The project was approved by the Board on March 13, 2008, but did not become effective
until January 29, 2009. The delay was due to the general elections in Grenada that took
place on July 8, 2008, during which the National Democratic Congress (formerly in
opposition) succeeded the New National Party. The Financing Agreement was signed on
December 19, 2008, nine months after the Board approval.
Although the project was declared effective on January 29, 2009, further delays with
setting up project management arrangements continued until the project launch on
October 20, 2009. The project Steering Committee was appointed on May 22, 2009,
following a Bank supervision mission in April 2009. However, Project Manager was
selected by the Ministry of Finance only in August 2009 (17 months after the Board
approval), which ultimately enabled the Government of Grenada to start implementation.
It took some three more months for the Project Coordination Unit, Project Management
Unit and implementing agencies to develop a set of 12 terms of references to initiate
procurement of consulting services, which were sent to the Bank on February 4, 2010.
The late mobilization of the implementing agency, impacted by the arrival of the new
government and insufficient project management capacity, led to the project’s extension
by nine months beyond the original closing date of October 31, 2011 to June 30, 2012.
The upgrade of the Customs information system from ASYCUDA 2.7 to a web-based
ASYCUDA World cost about 34% more than estimated at the appraisal stage, not
counting the network and hardware upgrade financed by the Government. The strategic
decision to reallocate project resources to achieve this upgrade proved to be the right
thing to do, as this led to a cardinal improvement of the quality and speed of services
provided to the trading community, modernized the work processes and improved
timeliness, access, and accuracy of customs information.
To mitigate the high risks of resistance to institutional changes in multiple beneficiary
institutions, a robust project management structure led by the Steering Committee was
implemented. The Steering Committee that involved all major stakeholders from the
public and private sector strongly contributed to the achievement of project results. Apart
from the late mobilization of the project management structure and especially the hiring
of the Project Manager, which caused significant delays, the project management
structure proved to be effective in ensuring coordination and close oversight on behalf of
the Ministry of Finance. To address resistance to change, key officials in the beneficiary
agencies were involved as components’ technical leaders. A robust communication

                                            9
program created high expectations among the ultimate project beneficiaries – the
business community - thus creating pressure to modernize key institutions: the Customs
Office, the Grenada Investment Development Corporation, the Grenada Bureau of
Standards and to a lesser extent the Inland Revenue Department.
The risk of the late and slow start up, brought about by the change in the administration
after project approval, had not been identified at design and no proactive measures had
been planned in this regard. Additionally, the departure of the original TTL soon after
project signing introduced some follow up delays on the Bank side.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design. The M&E system was quite extensive, reflecting the multi-sector nature of
the project. The project measured institutional and service quality changes in such
distinct areas as customs and tax administration, investment promotion and export
promotion. The original results framework was adjusted during the project restructuring
in October 2011. Efficiency indicators for tax and customs operational costs, as well as
indicators on tax arrears were removed, as the design of project activities did not allow
project inputs to be directly attributed to attainment of these indicators. Other revisions
were not significant (they were mostly editorial), as the majority of the original indicators
had been well chosen.

Implementation. The numerical indicators, such as client satisfaction with the quality of
services provided, were measured through the update of the Doing Business Survey and
through client surveys. The baseline for some indicators was established during the
appraisal stage, while the baseline for others was determined during the baseline surveys
in 2011. The reason for the late establishment of the baseline is that ‘client satisfaction’
with the service, chosen as an indicator at the design stage, could be only determined
through a client survey which was not possible at the approval stage because of the
absence of financial resources. Two surveys were commissioned and implemented during
the project by the implementing agency: one baseline survey was conducted early in 2011,
and the final survey that measured exit indicators was conducted in May-June 2012, prior
to project closure.

Utilization. Regretfully, the response to a structured questionnaire used for the final
survey was not statistically significant in certain cases (e.g., only six out of some 130
respondents returned data on measuring the time taken to pay taxes). For such cases of
inconclusive measurement, the achievement of the final objective will be judged based on
the Doing Business 2013 update. Some indicators applicable to several distinct
procedures were generalized to a single indicator, thus creating ambiguity in
measurement. For example, it was difficult to accurately assess the number of days taken
to process investment consent, as depending on the specific area of investment the
number of days would be different. According to the procedure developed during project
implementation, the requirements for review by government agencies depend on the type
of the investment, and can be as low as 1 day or as many as 10 days. Valid responses for
this indicator were not received in spite of the repeated survey. The Ministry of Finance

                                             10
awaits the update of the Doing Business survey to verify project results for reducing the
number of days for issuing investment consent.

The Project ISRs had been dully reflecting achievement of intermediate results starting
from 2011, when project activities started yielding results.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The project did not trigger any of the Environmental or Social Policy Safeguards.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The beneficiaries of the project have been actively involved in implementation, which is
a foundation of results sustainability. The project has helped develop institutional
capacity through training, implementation of upgrades of information systems, and the
purchase and installation of equipment and advisory services that helped develop plans
and manuals. The Customs Office upgraded its information system from ASYCUDA 2.7
to a web-based ASYCUDA World application, which is being used by the trained
Customs officers, Custom brokers, tariff clearers, and exporters. This is a sustainable
institutional change that reduced physical inspection of the commercial cargo and
customs clearance time below the set target, and introduced a more efficient custom
processing culture.
However, the project has not supported the consolidation of the changes introduced, as
some of the relevant agencies, such as Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Health,
Department of Licensing, and Department of Trade have not yet been connected on line
for processing the customs procedures. A local team of information specialists continues
working in those agencies to enable their online access. Training related to the
classification of the imported goods has not been implemented during the project.
However, an agreement was reached with the Customs Office that a Bank-administered
SEMCAR Program, supporting customs modernization in the Caribbean Region, will
provide necessary training support.
As for the tax administration information system’s SIGTAS upgrade, the project
contribution was constrained by the lack of resources (time and money) to implement a
comprehensive system upgrade, including that of the operational system platform (first
established in 1998) and the capacity of servers. The implemented taxpayers’ audit
module created a system overload which limited the use of the system by concurrent
users during initial attempts to run an audit search. It is likely that for an effective use of
the SIGTAS software application, further system upgrades would be required. As in the
previous case of Customs, it is possible for the SEMCAR program to support the analysis
and possibly an upgrade of the tax administration information system. Given that the
SIGTAS upgrade was completed in June 2012, just before the project closure, no
resources or time were available to address the SIGTAS system’s slow performance.
One of the objectives for tax modernization was strengthening the capacity of the Internal
Revenue Department (IRD) in planning and monitoring. Although the project provided
assistance to developing planning capacity through training, the planning capacity was

                                              11
not institutionalized through the establishment of an appropriate Planning Unit, due to the
lack of budgetary allocation. The IRD plans to set up such a unit in 2013, following
budget allocation for the Planning Unit for that year.
Among the most impressive project achievements is the capacity in conformity
assessment created in the Grenada Bureau of Standards (BOS). The BOS was equipped
with the state of the art equipment in the areas of microbiology and chemical testing,
metrology and construction materials testing. The competences of professional personnel
of the BOS have been developed through training and skills transfer. Presently, along
with using the equipment and learned skills in their daily work, the personnel of BOS
also provide training to colleagues in other OECS countries (e.g., to St. Vincent,
Dominica, St. Lucia). While testing and certification services were not previously
available to Grenadian exporters, presently BOS issues quality conformity certificates for
all interested exporters, as well as for the domestic producers at a fraction of a cost, as
these activities are partially financed by the government budget. The BOS is planning to
undergo an accreditation process in 2013 and build its capacity in line with the newest
trends in the area of conformity compliance.
The Grenada Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) has received support for
developing and implementing National Investment Promotion Strategy which was
approved in 2011. The strategy helped to identify five target sectors where Grenada has
comparative advantage. Presently, the GIDC staff work on creating investment
opportunities profiles, and doing feasibility analyses, thus providing subsidized services
to potential investors. The character of GIDC’s work has changed to a more focused,
project driven approach. The GIDC was organizationally restructured to align with the
five strategic priority sectors and project teams were created to lead the sector work.
The project was instrumental in supporting institutional development of GIDC that would
support the implementation of the Government investment strategy. For example, a
system of Monitoring and Evaluation was installed, allowing for measuring the impact of
GIDC’s work. The impact that GIDC plans to achieve is to create an additional 1,500
jobs by 2016, so as to alleviate the current level of unemployment (standing at 12,000
people). The GIDC, with the Cabinet approval, is implementing an investment incentive
scheme which includes investment allowances or tax exceptions. The European Union is
supporting the development and launch of an inter-agency information system for
investment promotion (initially planned under the project but not completed due to the
lack of funds, which were reallocated to support ASYCUDA World implementation).
The inter-agency information system would support on-line information sharing as well
as consolidate the investment approval procedures, in which various agencies are
involved.
The project has helped to achieve important improvements in the service quality in
customs, conformity assessment, investment approvals, and access to trade information.
The Director of Private Sector Development of the Ministry of Finance, who acted as the
Chairperson of the Steering Committee, considers the project to have laid the foundation
for improving the business environment. However, further improvements in revenue
collection and facilitation of trade and investment would benefit from continued technical
assistance. Due to financial constraints, the Government of Grenada is interested in


                                            12
mobilizing donor grant resources for supporting the private sector-led growth through
business facilitation and improving the quality of public sector management.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

Outcome Rating – Moderately Satisfactory

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The GDTAC Objectives were and remain relevant for Grenada’s economic growth through
strengthening of public management in organizations supporting trade, investments and
revenue collection.

The project development objective has identified critical areas for economic growth of
Grenada and improvement in revenue mobilization to support important government
programs. The project well targeted core areas of the national policy priorities as well as
the OECS Country Partnership Strategy, and proposed a practical way to modernize
relevant government institutions so as to enable them spur trade and investments in
Grenada.

However, the project underestimated the value of inputs required, which led to funds
redistribution among the components and the elimination of lower priority activities. For
example, the support of the tax administration advisor was cancelled; the size of
modernization of tax information system – SIGTAS – was reduced to fit the budget; the
post implementation support to ASYCUDA World was reduced due to lack of funds; the
intra-agency information network for investment promotion is being implemented outside
of the project with the support from EU finances; the connection of various agencies to
ASYCUDA World has not been completed under the project and is being followed up by
the government during the post implementation period. These results are mainly due to
two factors: time and money.

The implementation of the project was delayed for over one year due to the delayed
establishment of the project implementing structures and the lengthy procurement process.
The procurement process for update of the information system for tax administration was
complicated by the use of Single Source Selection procedures, which required scrupulous
reviews, and lengthy negotiations due to the need for contract price adjustment to fit the
available budget. The budget, although augmented by the contribution of the EU Trust
Fund, proved to be insufficient to fully achieve project objectives. When during the
ASYCUDA system upgrade, the Government faced the need to upgrade the
telecommunication infrastructure and hardware, it lieu of the full project contribution, the
Government made direct investment in infrastructure outside of the project financing
scheme.

Finally, from the technical perspective, the project did not consider the impact of the
SIGTAS system upgrade by adding an Audit Module on the ultimate SIGTAS
performance. A detailed study of the system platform and its anticipated performance
should have been done by an information specialist at the preparation stage. This could

                                            13
have avoided the unsatisfactory result that the use of the new additional Audit Module
slows down the SIGTAS system, preventing the simultaneous use of the system by many
concurrent Internal Revenue Service personnel. Regretfully, this omission by the design
team was not uncovered during the pre-approval stage. A Quality Enhancement Review
was not conducted for this project prior to approval.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Despite the start-up delays, and somewhat lengthy procurement process, exacerbated
by the lack of funds for the upgrade of information management systems for tax and
customs administration, the Project Development Objectives have been substantially
achieved.


Component 1. Customs Modernization: Outcome rating - Satisfactory

The efficiency and effectiveness of Customs has been improved through implementation
of the upgrade of the information system to a web-based ASYCUDA World version.
This version has enabled electronic data exchange between the Customs Administration
and the trading community through the Grenada Trade Portal (www.tradegreanda.gd).

Presently, the Customs Administration electronically processes Custom Declarations,
including claims for custom duty refunds, makes assessment and collection of custom
duty from travelers, processes applications for warehouse licensing, provides trade
statistics for other government bodies and deals with enquiries and complaints. As a
result of new procedures, the time for clearance of imported goods has been reduced, as
has the frequency of physical inspection of cargo, which was reduced below the original
target of 30% since the launch of the ASYCUDA World in April 2012. Customs officers
were trained in goods valuation.

Capacity for Post Clearance Audit has been built through the implementation of new
audit procedures and systems and through the training of auditors. Reduction of the time
taken for custom processing resulted in improved efficiency. This in turn contributed to
trade facilitation and satisfaction with the service within the trading community.

Component 2. Tax Administration Modernization: Outcome rating – Moderately
Unsatisfactory

Improvements in the efficiency of tax administration and a decrease of the transaction
costs have been partially achieved. Following the organizational and management
review of the Internal Revenue Department (IRD), the organizational structure of the IRD
has been optimized and better aligned with the IRD mandate. The audit function has been
consolidated and a new audit module of taxpayers has been added to the existing
SIGTAS system. This audit is operational and the auditors are trained in its use. However,
the upgrade impacted the performance of the SIGTAS application, due to the overloading
of system resources (the 1998 version of SIGTAS is run on a weak server of 4 Gb, and
the ORACLE operating system needs to be upgraded to the ORACLE 11.6 version). The
                                           14
IRD is considering upgrading the old operating system, which can be implemented
outside the project.

The project has not addressed the tax assessment automation in full, as data input into
the system is done manually - based on paper tax return forms submitted by taxpayers.
This leads to a slow tax return assessment. While the IRD was aware of the problem, it
was outside of the agreed project scope. It would have been important to conduct a
comprehensive assessment of the tax information system and design a comprehensive
system modernization plan during the design stage, in order to avoid partial solutions that
still leave the ultimate objective of tax modernization beyond reach.

The Planning Unit has been designed, including staffing, business procedures, and even
planning and monitoring skills; however, in the absence of a budget allocation for 2012,
such unit has not become operational. Yet, the trained group of specialists from other
IRD units develops Operational Plans for the implementation of the 3-year Strategic Plan
developed under the project. The IRD is receiving further planning support through the
Bank administered SEMCAR program. The IMF through its CARTAG program
reviewed the new functions and organizational structure as part of VAT performance
review in 2012 and found the new arrangements acceptable.

The target of a reduction of tax-payers’ time to pay taxes from 140 hours to 100 hours
has not been reached. The last available data obtained through the Doing Business 2013
still shows the same baseline value of 140 hours for preparing, filing and paying
corporate taxes. According to the views of the IRS officials, preparing tax returns takes
the longest time, as it reflects inherent weaknesses in businesses’ accounting system. This
could have been addressed by introducing accounting software in private sector
companies, but this was outside of the project scope. Therefore, this indicator could not
have been attributed to the project results, and would have required an additional
intervention and hence additional resources that were not available.

The increase in tax compliance has been only partially achieved. The tax compliance
indicator has improved from 59 to 39 percent (20 percentage points against the required
39 pp improvement). The activities that were supposed to lead to this result included
awareness events, review of return forms, etc. However, these activities have been only
partially successful. The IRD prepared and sent tax information (forms) to taxpayers on a
monthly basis, but according to IRD officials this measure was insufficient to deal with
the cultural change. Also, since the audit module has not been in active use since its
deployment in June 2012, it is not possible to attribute compliance improvements to
strengthening the audit function. Tax enforcement remains an area for the Government to
continue addressing. The lack of funds to procure tax advisory services to guide and
support IRD efforts may have possibly contributed to the lack of achievement in this area.

Component 3. Modernization of Investment Promotion: Outcome rating – Satisfactory

The project advanced well toward modernizing investment promotion. The Grenada
Investment Generation Strategy 2012-2016 has been developed, setting an objective of

                                            15
increasing private capital investment in five priority sectors: agribusiness, energy, health
education and wellness services, information communication technology, and tourism.
The implementation of the Strategy is well on track. The project supported organizational
strengthening of the Grenada Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) that improves
the portfolio of services offered to Grenadian investors.

The information portal (www.grenadaidc.com) provides useful information for investors
(investor’s guide, various application forms in .pdf format, etc.). Currently, the GIDC is
working on establishing an Investment Facilitation Network, which will be launched in
November 2012. The GIDC has lately received recognition from the World Bank for the
speed in response to investors, and FIAS ranked Grenada second after Brazil in Latin
America for the progress in developing the investment climate in Grenada.

Component 4. Implementation of Export Strategy: Outcome rating – Highly
Satisfactory

The project has achieved its objective of supporting Grenadian exporters by providing
access to trade information and strengthening the capacity of the Bureau of Standards.
Grenada Trade Portal (http://tradegrenada.gd/) was launched on June 14, 2012. It
provides information on trading opportunities, products and markets. The Bureau of
Standards has built its capacity in key areas and effectively provides conformity
assessment, supports measurement standardization in local manufacturing, and offers
quality assurance and certification of exported goods. These are important achievements
supporting exporters of Grenada.

Component 5. Project Management –Moderately Satisfactory

The project management component played a critical role in implementation, mobilizing
and coordinating consultancies and project beneficiaries, supporting decision-making by
the Steering Committee, monitoring project results and observing project fiduciary
arrangements. Procurement was slow, causing implementation delays. However, the
performance of the Project Manager and the Project Coordination Unit improved toward
the end of the project. This contributed to the high degree of attainment of the formally
revised results, implementation of the client surveys to measure the impact of the project, and
high degree of utilization of the allocated IDA and EU resources.

3.3 Efficiency

The project has set up efficiency indicators for the cost of custom operations and tax
administration as a share of the revenue collected. Admittedly, it has been difficult for the
Internal Revenue Department to monitor its administration costs, as IRD does not have
control over its budget and accounting system. As for the cost of Customs, at approval,
the project introduced an indicator measuring operational costs of Customs as a share of
the total revenue collection. However, during the restructuring this indicator was dropped.

In the view of the management of the Customs Administration, it was difficult to achieve
the reduction of operating costs from 2.1% to 1.5% during the economic crisis, as with

                                               16
the economic decline and the accompanying reduction in international trade, the size of
customs’ revenue declined. New staff employees were added to enable expanded service
levels, which added to the operating costs. The implemented upgrade of the Customs
information system to ASYCUDA World is likely to render Customs more efficient
through the contribution to operational savings (e.g., through faster processing of custom
procedures or through a reduction of the physical inspection of cargo). However, given
that the launch of the information system has been done recently, it is too early to make
any definitive quantitative conclusions.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The project has fully achieved its development objectives in three of four cases:
modernize Customs, implement key elements of the export strategy and modernize
investment promotion. The project development objectives were well chosen to address
the central issue of creating conditions for sustainable growth through improvements in
trade, business/investment facilitation, and building capability of public institutions to
support the above activities, while simultaneously strengthening government
effectiveness and efficiency in revenue collection. These objectives were the focus of the
government reform and growth agenda, as well as that of the Bank’s strategy.

The modernization of tax administration started under the project with laying down the
foundations for a better performing IRD: aligning the structure with functions,
strengthening planning and monitoring function, improving the audit capacity,
introducing an audit module to the information management system SIGTAS. However,
more support is required to IRD to translate the initial initiatives to better outcomes. This
has not been possible to achieve under the project financial and time constraints.
However, the World Bank engagement in the area of tax administration continues
through a regional SEMCAR project, supported by the Canadian government and
administered by the World Bank. The same core team, including the TTL and technical
specialists, are continuing engagement in strengthening tax administration capacity. This
facilitates the achievement of the tax administration modernization started under GDTAC.

From the efficiency perspective the project’s impact is significant, although this is
difficult to measure. The improvement of investment and doing business environment,
the facilitation of trade, the services in support of economic activities of the private sector
actors is likely to impact the GDP growth and ultimately translate into greater revenues
collected through government programs. Efficiency would be also supported through: (i)
enhancement in government’s openness; (ii) better access to information; (iii) improved
reliability of government performance, supported through more strategically managed
institutions supported by upgraded information systems; (iv) faster speed and better
quality of service; and (v) elimination of sources of corruption by limiting face time
between government institutions and clients.


3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

                                              17
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The indirect impact of the project is reduction of poverty through improving conditions
for business activity: trade and investment. It translates in new employment and personal
revenues. Better revenue administration will result and is already showing signs of better
revenue collection. This means more fiscal room for the government to address social
programs.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Institutional changes have occurred under GDTAC in the Customs, Inland Revenue
Department, Grenada Industrial Development Corporation, and the Bureau of Standard.
Other agencies taking part in the customs procedures and in investment approval have
also adjusted their procedures and information system to improve government services
that facilitate trade and investments. These institutions have experienced profound
cultural changes from low value added routines to modern management procedures that
are rational, transparent and efficient. The capacity of personnel that were directly
involved in the project has improved. All this is translating in better services, better
information access and improved customer satisfaction.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The growing capacity of the government institutions involved in the project creates
confidence in the possibility of change, as well as attracts the donor community to
support more advanced modernization building on the created technical capacity,
stronger institutions, and the commitment of the government.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Beneficiary surveys were conducted twice during the project lifetime: in 2011 before the
implementation of major changes and within two months of project closure in 2012. The
surveys measured client expectations and client perceptions of the quality of services in
the custom, tax, investment promotion and trade facilitation areas. These surveys
illustrated growing expectations and also growing perceptions of the improving service
quality. However, the short time that elapsed since achievement of project final outputs
related to information systems most likely gave customers insufficient time to fully
experience all potential benefits, perhaps explaining why the gap between the
expectations and perception increased in some cases. The general conclusion of the
surveys was the acknowledgement of service improvements, although numerically
modest. The detailed presentation of survey results is found in Annex 5.

In the case of some surveys (such as the time needed to pay taxes), the customer response
was not sufficient for making statistically significant estimation of results. Given that
some of the project indicators coincide with the indicators measured by the Doing
Business report, in the future the Government would be able to monitor the movement in
customer expectations and perceptions and use this feedback for continuous improvement.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Negligible to Low

The low risk of maintaining the development outcome over the years is supported by the
demonstrated high commitment at the decision-making level at the Ministry of Finance to
further strengthen public management systems and further develop high quality services
for business actors. Support to tax modernization would be required in the medium term
and is expected to be provided through the SEMCAR project. Potential risks may come
from slow legislative action of the government in the area of electronic provision of
services that would recognize electronic records as legitimate. So far the use of the
information system ASYCUDA World for custom processing is not mandatory. This
means that some traders can still rely on manual procedures that reduce service efficiency.

The training on new procedures and implementation of information systems creates a
good basis for sustainability. The ownership of development outcomes, as demonstrated
by core management and technical teams, appears to be high. During the discussions of
project outcomes, the managers of the beneficiary organization were appreciative of
results, although also aware of new development opportunities and challenges. The
Bureau of Standards, for example, recognizes the rapid innovations in the area of product
safety and the need to keep up their product testing capabilities in order to support
exporters and local producers. The GIDC is using a strategic sector approach that would
help future investors to make strategic investment decisions. Access to trade information
would help local producers to explore new export possibilities. Better Customs services
would improve efficiency of international trade. All these innovations would be
supported by the private sector demand.

For the tax administration, full benefits of the results achieved are likely to be realized
with the future support from Bank’s SEMCAR program to implementation of tax
modernization strategy and further enhancing their information system.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The objectives of the project were well chosen and the design generally supported the
objectives. However, insufficient analysis was done during preparation in relation to
specific institutional development issues, detailed requirements for information
technology upgrades, and consequently to the costs of the activities leading to attainment
of the project objectives. In terms of technical design, a more detailed assessment of the
existing information system used for tax administration (SIGTAS) should have been
carried out in order to assess not only functional requirements of the upgrades but also
future impact of these upgrades on the system’s technical capabilities (e.g., operating
system, performance, system response time, etc.). Similarly, the upgrade of the customs
information system to a web-based solution could have benefited from an assessment of
implications on the network infrastructure; something that required additional
government investments during implementation.

                                            19
The quality of financial planning at entry could have been better and based on a more
detailed analysis (technical and financial) of needed inputs. Related to the technical
design, there was a need to make more accurate cost estimation for the achievement of
project objectives at the project design stage. The lack of funds to implement initially
planned activities led to cutting or consolidating inputs in four of the five components to
make attainment of key results possible. During the 2011 restructuring, the team wrote in
the restructuring paper: “given the delay in implementation and the actual costs of critical
inputs, project activities have been streamlined to focus on activities that are critical and
have the most value added for achieving the PDO”. While the Government counterpart
financing was planned, no covenants related to how this would be achieved were
envisaged. As a result, the Government contributed only 6 percent of the declared
contribution amount. Yet in total, to enable the ASYCUDA upgrade, the Government
spent almost 20% more than initially pledged to provide the enabling environment
(network and hardware) for web based access to ASYCUDA.

Another problem that hit the project from the very beginning was a protracted delay in its
launch. Although it had been well known that the country faced an election, the
associated risk for mobilizing the implementing and beneficiary organizations was not
properly assessed. As a result, the project was launched 19 months after approval, leading
to an eight month extension that proved too short to enable technical support after the
implementation of major information system upgrades in the Customs and IRD.

During the implementation, procurement was a challenge. These challenges were the
result of a number of factors: the procurement capacity of the recipient and the choice of
single source selection for both upgrades of the information system, as the government
used proprietary systems which they chose to maintain. The length of the procurement
process for contracting services of the firm SOGEMA for the SIGTAS upgrade - almost
two years - was especially long. Since the first submission of the TOR for Bank review in
February 2010 to signing the contract in the first week of January 2012, the Project
Coordination Unit engaged in back and forth negotiations with the sole vendor that led to
revising the scope and financial envelope. The system implementation upgrade from
January to June 2012 was quite short. The cuts in the scope of upgrade due to
insufficient budget, as well as overlooked need for upgrade the hardware and operating
platform during the design stage, have probably led to the SIGTAS system’s unstable
performance after its implementation.

The implementation process faced resource challenges: time and money. Arguably, these
challenges could have been envisaged at preparation and approval.

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory




                                             20
The quality at entry could have been improved to avoid implementation delays and the
lack of funding to complete activities leading to the achievement of development
objectives. Technical problems, related to upgrade of information systems, could have
been avoided had there been a realistic assessment of the existing ICT system’s
(specifically, SIGTAS) performance, projected performance after the upgrade, the need
for additional network infrastructure, server capability and robustness of the operating
platform. Should the project team have involved technical specialists in analyzing
functional requirements and technical specifications for the system upgrade, the cost of
the planned ASYCUDA and SIGRAS upgrade could have been more realistically
projected.

Some results indicators, such as those measuring efficiency through the reduction of
operating costs in tax and customs, were only vaguely related to project activities and
intermediate outcomes. For example, the IRD, as a department of the MOF, does not
have independent budget authority, therefore, does not have direct control or incentives
over cutting operational costs. In the end, the efficiency indicators were dropped during
the restructuring. Overall, the ambitiousness of the project objectives was not
commensurate with the projected costs of activities.

An initial IT assessment of the SIGTAS’ (installed in 1998) technical capabilities should
have been performed during the design stage, prior to deciding to implement additional
modules for tax audit purposes. Presently, the IRD needs additional sources of funding
(potentially from the SEMCAR program administered by the World Bank) to implement
required system analysis and updates.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank supervision missions were timely and focused on monitoring results, as well as
assisting the government with resolving implementation challenges. The ISRs were filed
as per procedure. Project ratings were realistic. Some slowness of procurement clearances,
mentioned by the Project Coordination Unit (PCU), has been explained by a lack of
timely compliance with procurement procedures on the part of the client. The choice of a
Sole Source Selection method of procurement for the upgrade of the proprietary software
application SIGTAS resulted in delays, as this method required additional vigilance
during the review on the part of Bank procurement specialists. However, more
significantly, the lack of finances led to incremental reduction of the contract scope and
repeated negotiations over the scope and price.

Fiduciary arrangements in place have been satisfactory and the project audit issued
unqualified opinions. To the credit of the Bank supervision team, it helped the
Government overcome problems of insufficient resources through a timely restructuring,
when the need for more time and the lack of money became evident to both the
Government and the Bank team. However, the final supporting argument for satisfactory
rating is practical attainment of the project Development Objectives in spite of time and
resource constraint.

                                           21
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Overall Bank performance during design and implementation of the project is moderately
satisfactory. While the technical, financial and project mobilization challenges were not
realistically assessed at entry, during supervision these issues have been addressed and
the Government achieved most of the project objectives.

5.2 Borrower Performance


(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Following the elections in July 2008, the change in administration triggered a prolonged
delay in launching the project. Even after signing early in 2009, it took the government
an inadequately long time to set up an implementation structure. However, after the
launch of the project in October 2009, the government support to implementation was
quite effective. The Steering Committee, chaired by the Minister and managed by the
Director of Economic Development of the Ministry of Finance, worked regularly and
effectively, monitoring progress and addressing emerging issues. The Government has
not met its counterpart contribution pledge to provide the equivalent of US$250,000 to
co-finance planned project activities. This amount, however, was surpassed through
Government parallel financing of network infrastructure that enabled web-based
operation of ASYCUDA World for processing customs clearances from remote devises.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The Ministry of Finance, as an implementing agency, coordinated project beneficiary
agencies including the Customs Administration (CA), the Internal Revenue Department
(IRD), the Trade Department (TD), the Bureau of Standards (BOS), and the Grenada
Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC). The degree of commitment and ownership
were mixed among most of the entities involved: from very high in GIDC, BOS, and CA
to somewhat lower in IRD. The performance of the project suffered from a slow
procurement process, especially for the contracts related to upgrade of information
technology, resulting in significant delays in implementation.

The implementing agency conducted an effective awareness program, making sure that
ultimate beneficiaries of the project knew about the changes being introduced in the trade
and investment processes. However, the implementing agency did not ensure budget
allocation necessary for institutionalizing the strategic planning and monitoring function
in the IRD. The delays in effecting legislative changes to ensure that electronic records
processed through the ASYCUDA World were considered legally acceptable in lieu of
the paper records resulted in the use of a dual electronic and paper-based customs


                                            22
clearance system. This impacts the ultimate productivity of the Customs system by
increasing the time of processing of customs clearances.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
In spite of delays caused by political (initially) and technical (during implementation)
reasons, the project has achieved most of its objectives. The implementing agency
supported by the Project Management Unit ensured good coordination and focus on
results among the GDTAC beneficiaries. Good information and awareness program
created interest and demand for better government services in support of trade and
investment activities. Procurement performance was most of the time less than
satisfactory, causing delays in mobilizing consultancy. That led to late implementation of
important information system upgrades and left practically no time before the closure of
the project to fully eliminate program bugs in the SIGTAS system.

6. Lessons Learned

GDTAC offers a number of general and specific, project-related lessons, listed below.

    •   A strong ownership and coordination enabled the implementing agency to
        address implementation challenges that were critical to the achievement of the
        Development Objectives. This project has achieved most of the original
        objectives to a large extent due to a regular, bi-weekly coordination meetings of
        the Steering Committee, that with the support of the Chairman and the Project
        Manager kept implementing agencies focused on results and accountable for their
        achievement.
    •   Pro-activeness in resolving the lack of financial resources was essential to the
        achievement of the project Development Objectives. It is important to leverage
        insufficient IDA resources with other development partners in small IDA
        counties.
    •   Financial challenges in implementing projects in small countries. Given the
        size of the country, there is a limit of borrowing from debt sustainability
        considerations. However, intervention to address institutional weaknesses does
        not reduce in step with the size of the economy. This implies that traditional
        investment operations, costly for the Bank to support (inadequate supervision
        budget to permit involvement of technical specialists in the areas outside Bank’s
        staff expertise), may not be the best instrument from efficiency point of view.
        Regional programs, such as SEMCAR, that target a number of small countries,
        that experience similar institutional development issues, could serve as a model
        of a combination of analytical and technical assistance support. Having the same
        team allows the Bank team to acquire and use expertise in addressing problems
        specific for the region.
    •   Technical design of the project activities, related to the upgrade of information
        systems, should include professional assessment by an ICT specialist to avoid

                                           23
    partial upgrade solutions that may be incompatible with or too burdensome for
    the technical performance capabilities of an old operational system. Detailed cost
    assessment for information solutions should be made based on market reference
    costs to avoid insufficient allocation of resources for key information system
    upgrades. Analysis at the preparation stage should also include consideration of
    options of replacing the information system with new solutions, as an alternative
    to upgrading an old system. In the case of the system for tax administration,
    SIGTAS is an old system deployed in 1998, and at the time of preparation in
    2007 and implementation in 2011-2012, other competing options based on newer
    technological solutions could have been considered.
•   When costs of activities are estimated, it is essential that the Bank team carry
    out an analysis of the costs involved: those to be covered from the project
    proceeds and those additional costs that the government will have to bear as a
    counterpart contribution (e.g., for telecommunication network upgrade). Similar
    information technology solutions implemented at the time of preparation in other
    projects could be one guide; however, specific country conditions (e.g.,
    infrastructure) should be assessed by information technology specialists. This
    could provide a more realistic guidance to determining future project costs.
•   While sole source selection may appear a quick and easy way to procure
    consulting services for a proprietary system upgrade, in reality it took this project
    almost two years (23 months) to complete the procurement process, when funds
    were insufficient and the government had to cut back its requirements and
    provide very detailed justification for the cost structure in the contract.
    Procurement under Quality-and-Cost-Based Selection may have avoided
    difficulties of procurement in the non-competitive environment.
•   For Government counterpart financing, if it is expected to finance project
    components leading to achievement of Development Objectives, specific
    arrangements for disbursements should be worked out and protected through
    project implementation covenants in order to avoid non-compliance of the
    Government in allocating and disbursing funds. Also if institutional reforms
    envisage setting up new organizational units, such as Planning and Monitoring
    Unit in the Internal Revenue Department, the project could specify in an
    implementation covenant that the Government should provide necessary
    budgetary resources to enable institutionalization of such a function during the
    project lifetime, to assure sustainability.
•   Suitability of the procurement Bank procurement rules to the small
    countries. There is a specific issue of availability of technical expertise in the
    consultancy market of a small country with the population of approximately
    100,000 inhabitants. International consultancy, while indispensible in certain
    instances, may be cost-prohibitive more generally due to island countries’
    isolation from the mainland. It would be useful for the Bank to analyze this
    aspect ensuring that the balance between the competition in procurement (as a
    condition of better quality) and the associated costs. The low IDA allocation
    envelope and modest grant resources mobilization capability of the small island


                                         24
           states either suggests very narrow and limited scope of assistance or new more
           cost efficient procedures.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The Borrower suggested that:

      •   All activities, even if not included in the project, but essential for the achievement
          of Development Objectives, need to be appraised and reflected in the Project
          Appraisal Document, to inform the Government’s resource planning. The Project
          Manager commented that the need to upgrade the information network
          infrastructure for implementation of ASYCUDA was not reflected. This led the
          Government to commit and disburse additional US$287,392 equivalent that had
          not been planned in advance. Mobilizing significant amount of unplanned
          resources by the Government is problematic and usually leads to delays.
      •   The Borrower complained about the long procurement process leading to
          obtaining Bank’s no objection and delays in response of the beneficiary agencies
          to the comments on the quality of procurement documents. The issue was
          discussed with the TTL and two explanations were offered. First, the inadequate
          quality of the submitted documents, specifically terms of reference, required
          Bank’s review and comments, in order to meet the requirements of Consultants
          Guidelines. However, the Borrower has not always been consistent in working on
          the latest Bank commented version and incorporating all of the suggested changes.
          This caused delays. The second explanation of long procurement process was
          related to the Sole Source Selection process that requires an additional scrutiny by
          the Bank’s procurement team to ensure efficient procurement despite lack of
          competition. Finally, the insufficient budget forced repeated readjustments in the
          scope of work which, required additional reviews and caused delays.
      •   Implementing agencies expressed regrets that the project was closed 3 almost
          immediately after the implementation of the main information system upgrades.
          This left them with insufficient support in operating the new system. Although the
          training had been delivered, in the case of tax administration, running the new
          audit module created significant system overload, limiting the possibility of
          concurrent users to work through the system. The explanation for this is that the
          scope of updates to the SIGTAS system was narrowed down due to insufficient
          finances. Therefore, important other system upgrades were cancelled. This
          ultimately resulted in the need to seek other financing options to conduct the
          necessary operating system upgrades. The Bank SEMCAR program plans to
          address concerns related to the performance of SIGTAS.

    The project was closed on June 30, 2012, which is the revised project closing date


                                                  25
(b) Cofinanciers

The European Union (EU) co-financed project implementation in the amount of
US$655,000 equivalent (EUR500,000). The EU raised issues of slow mobilization of
activities and delivery of results in the initial phases of the project in 2010. Once the
project activities picked up, the EU, whose representative sat on the Steering Committee,
was engaged in constructive project supervision along with the Bank team.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

The Grenada Chamber of Commerce is an important project stakeholder and beneficiary.
The Chairperson of the Chamber of Commerce was part of the Steering Committee and,
according to the Ministry of Finance, this collaboration proved to be very effective and
set   a    positive    example     of     public-private    development     cooperation.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The project was expected to provide a direct impact on improvement of service delivery
in the areas of the public sector that support the Government in fostering its economic
activity through promotion of exports and investments, improving the investment climate,
as well as modernizing tax and custom administration to ensure improved collection of
revenue to finance government programs in Grenada.

The medium-to-long term impacts were expected to be substantial, including better
service and reduction of custom clearance time, reduced time and transaction costs for
entrepreneurs while they pay taxes, greater access to trade data and issuance quality
assurance to support Grenadian exporters, and increased investments as a result of a more
streamlined and faster system for investment approval in Grenada.

The early project results demonstrate achievement of shorter processing time in Customs
through the use of the web-based and easily accessed by the trading community and
government agencies upgraded information management system ASYCUDA World
(AW). Total cargo release time reduced from 8.6 days prior to the launch of the new
system to 3.73 days, with significant time reduction for both parties: Declarants and
Customs officials. The time for the Customs has reduced 33 times from 4 days to less
than 3 hours. Web access allows custom brokers to file information and follow the
procedure from either computer workstations set up in several locations in Grenada or
access the AW system from their mobile devices.

Significant capacity improvements have been achieved in investment and export
promotion: from much improved access to information to electronic services. The time
for investment approval has been reduced from 215 days to 123 days (for the longest
procedure) or shorter, according to Doing Business 2012 report. The processing of
investment applications has been reduced from 90 to 30 days. The quality of information
and support to investors has improved and will continue improving in the next 3-5 years
when the sector studies will provide good guidance on investment opportunities.

Overall the project created better conditions for business start-ups, investors and cross-
border trade. This would lead to stabilizing government revenue and job creation in the
coming years. These potential benefits make the IDA contribution of SDR 1.2 million
into this project a worthwhile investment into the future of Grenada. This investment also
enabled the mobilization of the EU funds in the amount of EUR 500,000, as well as the
investment of the Government in the total amount of US$302,133 equivalent, of which
EC$42,315 was a counterpart contribution and EC$772,568 was Government parallel
financing that helped strengthened network infrastructure to enable the web-based access
to ASYCUDA World.

        Inland Revenue Division;
  (iii) ease for exporters and potential exporters of finding information on trade and
        export;
  (iv) quality of service delivered by the Customs Department; and
  (v) investors’ and potential investors’ perception of the quality of service delivered
        by the Grenada Industrial Development corporation.

Surveys also were conducted (twice) to assess the time taken by businesses to pay taxes,
but were found inconclusive due to the low response rates, which made it impossible to
determine statistically significant results.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The Borrower’s ICR provides important insights into the achievements as well as
challenges faced during the implementation. The Borrower’s ICR gives a complete
overview of the results achieved by the Government with GDTAC support, which is
accurate and consistent with the observations of the Bank team during supervision
missions and consistent with the results of the interviews conducted by the ICR mission
after the project closure. The main messages reflected in the ICR were reiterated during
the final meeting with the Chairman of the Project Steering Committee.

General Borrower’s Conclusions

Despite the late launch of the Project that took place in October 2009, or 19 months after
Board approval and eight months after effectiveness, the project achieved most of its
objectives. The project budget, being lower than planned, could not support in full all the
activities, and along with the initial implementation delays, caused project restructuring
in October 2011. The restructuring resulted in cancelling some activities of lower priority
in order to fit the available financing. While IDA and EU financing was realized in full,
the Government counterpart funding for project activities was executed only up to 6
percent of what was planned. Given the reduction of activities, a few intermediate
project indicators were amended.

The Borrower’s ICR identifies a number of challenges experienced through the life of the
project, such as:
    • Inadequate budgeting and insufficient allocation of resources in the procurement
        plans. This led to procurement delays and re-advertising when financial proposals
        of interested consultancies exceeded the available budget. Financing of some
        activities (e.g. Investment Promotion Network) had to be mobilized outside the
        project budget.
    • Delays in the procurement process due to late responses from the Bank 4 as well as
        key project stakeholders.
    • Limited counterpart funding caused disbursement delays. That created numerous
        problems with implementation of ASYCUDA World system in the Customs
        Department.
    • The late launch of the project (19 months delay) resulted in completion of some
        key activities immediately before the closure. Both information systems updates,
        ASYCUDA World and SIGTAS, were completed in June 2012.

Borrower provided comments on the draft ICR, which are included in the ICR package.

  An analysis during the ICR preparation revealed that Bank comments were not always fully
addressed, making issuing No Objection problematic. A random sample of communication
records between the Bank and the Project Coordination Unit does not show excessive delays in
Bank team’s responses.
