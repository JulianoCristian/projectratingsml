"versiontyp": "Final", "loan_no": "7126", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The ratings for the Tax Reform\n            Adjustment Loan for Mexico were as follows: the outcome was\n            satisfactory, the sustainability was likely, the\n            institutional development impact was substantial, the Bank\n            and borrower performance were both satisfactory. The lessons\n            learned indicate that in operations where approval of\n            reforms is uncertain, it is preferable to wait until they\n            are approved and then make the approved measures part of\n            conditionality. In some of the structural adjustment loans,\n            the submission of a law that incorporates the reforms is a\n            satisfactory condition for approval of it or for tranche\n            disbursement. The Tax Reform Adjustment Loan (TRAL) could\n            have been submitted for Board approval in its original form,\n            but the Bank and the Mexican Government decided to wait\n            until the reforms were approved by Congress. Based upon the\n            reforms that were approved, it was decided to lower the\n            amount of the loan. However, if the actions prior to the\n            Board presentation and first tranche disbursement had been\n            only the submission of the laws, with a second tranche after\n            the approval of these reforms, the project would have been\n            less successful because not all the reforms in the five\n            areas of the initial proposal were approved. Therefore, in\n            operations where the approval of reforms is risky, it is\n            better to wait until they are approved and have them as a\n            loan conditionality. Fiscal data estimates need to be\n            treated with caution. Mexican fiscal estimates -the only\n            sources for most data- have a tendency to be optimistic, so\n            for future World Bank operations these data needs to be\n            treated with caution and analysis based on them should be\n            adjusted. Congress needs to be involved right from the\n            beginning in any reform program that requires its approval.\n            In Mexico, the executive sent the fiscal reform package to\n            Congress with minimal prior discussion. As a result,\n            consideration of the reform took more than seven months, and\n            finally the initial reform proposal submitted to Congress\n            was changed substantially. Therefore, before the submission\n            of any reform to Congress, the reforms should be discussed\n            with the different political fractions to build a consensus\n            and facilitate approval."}, "docdt": "2003-10-08T00:00:00Z"}
