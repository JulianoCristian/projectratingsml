Adjustment Loan\n            Project is expected to improve growth due to reduction of\n            distortions in the tax system, enhance macroeconomic\n            stability, improve equity in the personal income tax code,\n            and provide more tax resources to finance social programs.\n            In the area of corporate income taxes, the new law 1)\n            eliminates the special cash-flow regime for calculating\n            income for the agriculture and road transport sectors; 2)\n            simplifies the inflation adjustment regime, just using the\n            annual price index to calculate real change in monetary\n            assets and liabilites; 3) eliminates the reduced tax rate\n            for retained earnings, thus unifying the corporate and\n            maximum personal tax rates at 35 percent, and reduces the\n            rate gradually to 32 percent by 2005; 4) limits the\n            corporate deductions for payment of fringe benefits to\n            non-union workers; and 5) phases out the reduced tax rate\n            for the publishing industry, bringing the rate up to the\n            standard rate by 2006. In the area of personal income taxes,\n            the new law 1) aggregates all the taxable income of an\n            individual and taxes it at the corresponding progressive\n            rate; 2) simplifies the structure of rates, reducing the\n            number to five by 2005; 3) reduces the government subsidy\n            for workers in the formal sector and provides incentives for\n            firms to continue paying it; and 4) simplifies the tax\n            regime for individuals with entrepreneurial activity."}, "docdt": "2002-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
