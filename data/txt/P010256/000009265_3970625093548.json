The project\n            achieved its main objectives, its impact on institutional\n            development was substantial, sustainability is likely, and\n            both the Bank and Borrower performed satisfactorily. Several\n            lessons can be learned from this project. First, project\n            implementation was enhanced by ICTAD and IDA staff taking\n            into consideration the experience and lessons learned during\n            the first vocational project. Second, the training\n            assessments, tracer and impact studies facilitated\n            responsive management decisions and more responsive training\n            programs. Third, the offering of responsive programs allowed\n            ICTAD to gradually introduce cost recovery. Fourth,\n            ICTAD's utilization of primarily short-term and skill\n            focused technical assistance was more economical and\n            facilitated capacity building in the construction industry.\n            Fifth, ICTAD piloting income generation was a bold step\n            within a society which advocates free services. Finally,\n            ICTAD's close involvement with industry and trade\n            associations has yielded better quality training and\n            employability of graduates."}, "docdt": "1996-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
