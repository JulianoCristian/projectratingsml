The first component - rehabilitation of dams -\n            will support the engineering design of rehabilitation\n            activities for 29 dams, and the preparation of an emergency\n            preparedness plan for the Yerevan Lake Dam. In addition,\n            implementation of rehabilitation works include 47 dams\n            (i.e., design for 29 dams provided for under this project,\n            and the already prepared design for 18 dams, under the first\n            Dam Safety Project), construction supervision, and,\n            installation of monitoring equipment devices on the 47 dams.\n            The second component will ensure dam safety sustainability,\n            through the installation of dams safety equipment\n            (telecommunication equipment, sirens, searchlights, loud\n            speakers), provision of technical assistance and equipment\n            to the Water Supply Agency (WSA) for the design of an\n            integrated telecommunication network for all dams,\n            preparation of regulations, and operational procedures to\n            guide all parties involved in the management of dams, and,\n            implementation of annual independent audits on WSA\n            operations and accounts.
