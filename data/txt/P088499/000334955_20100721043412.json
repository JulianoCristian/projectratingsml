     Safety Project for Armenia were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: 1) to\n            find a problem in a dam, how to qualify the problem, and how\n            to propose measures to improve dam safety, are all difficult\n            tasks and need a lot of experience. Many times it needs to\n            rely mostly on international experience and also to carry\n            out detailed geotechnical investigations and field\n            inspection and testing; 2) it is usual that some of the\n            originally proposed design solutions may change during\n            construction as a result of more detailed investigations; 3)\n            training is essential for the staff of the Project\n            Implementation Unit (PIU) and Water Supply Agency (WSA) on\n            dam safety aspects especially as this is a very specialized\n            field; 4) establishing a separate dam agency for Operation\n            and Maintenance (O&M) or a special unit within the WSA\n            is preferable because dam O&M is a very specialized\n            operation which requires experience and high professional\n            skills; and 5) improvements on dam management and on\n            optimizing of water utilization, is still needed in the\n            country. This would involve computer based operation and\n            management, and may be, construction of new dams, especially\n            on the rivers which have the potential for cascade dams.\n            This can be subject to a new follow up project which at\n            least look at the optimization aspects of operation and\n            management of existing dams and further strengthening the\n            management of the country dams."}, "docdt": "2010-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
