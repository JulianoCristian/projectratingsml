This report discusses potential\n            negative impacts and proposes measures to mitigate them. To\n            offset impacts connected with new spillway construction and\n            reconstruction of existing spillways, slope protection, and\n            rehabilitation of an irrigation outlet,  employ the\n            following measures: construct tunnel waterways in lieu of\n            open trenches and widen existing spillways. Avoid improper\n            disposal of excavated materials and construction wastes that\n            might damage the vegetal cover and pollute water by\n            obtaining permits, providing zones of preliminary\n            accumulation of wastes, disposing of wastes according to\n            established procedures and in designated areas, and\n            restoring excavated materials for slope protection. To\n            prevent topsoil loss due to temporary access roads and work\n            areas, delineate access roads/work areas carefully and\n            prevent their expansion, and restore vegetal cover. Use\n            closed/covered trucks to transport construction materials,\n            and clean area from dust by sprinkling water, removing\n            excess materials, and clearing sites. Arrange preservation\n            measures -protection areas, bypasses-and cease works when\n            encountering historical/cultural monuments. Restore\n            landscape after works are completed."}, "docdt": "2004-05-07T13:32:05Z"}
