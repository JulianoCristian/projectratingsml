        Armenia: Irrigation Dam Safety II Project                              E943
                       Environmental Management Plan (EMP)

1.     Introduction

The project is designed as a four-year program for improving, through rehabilitation/
reconstruction, the safety of 47 dams (including safety measures for Kechut and Kaps dams),
providing control measurement devices at 56 dam sites, providing minimal requirement of O&M
equipment for 55 dams, preparing the Emergency Preparedness Plan (EPP) for the Yerevan lake
dam, providing the minimal needed telecom. equipment for implementing all EPPs, improving
the access to 16 dam sites, providing training on dam safety issues to operators of 60 dams,
providing training and support on dam regulatory issues to the Dam Maintenance branch of the
Water Supply Agency.

The EMP identifies the major relevant structural work operations of the project and indicates the
types of impacts expected; the types of mitigation measures likely to be necessary; the
institutional responsibilities for program execution, supervision, and monitoring; and the timing
for implementation.


2.     Project Objective

The development objective of the Irrigation Dam Safety Project, which is “to protect the
population and the socio-economic infrastructure down-stream of dams facing the highest risk of
failure” is also the PDO for this repeater project, Irrigation Dam Safety Project but on a much
more extended geographic scale. The project will also contribute to enhance the sustainability of
economic activities which are dependent on a reliable supply of water. Proceeds of the Project
will be used exclusively to assist in financing interventions aimed at significantly lowering the
safety risk of those dams. These interventions are deemed necessary on the basis of the findings
of technical investigations undertaken under the Irrigation Dam Safety Project, which called for
urgent action to prevent many of the investigated dams from entering into an emergency state in
the near future.


3.     Major Work Operations

Overall project structural and physical works are classified in 6 categories as follows:
   (i)     upstream protection works;
   (ii)    spillway capacity increase and rehabilitation;
   (iii)   leakage reduction;
   (iv)    irrigation/bottom outlet repairs and installation of safety equipment;
   (v)     in some cases construction/rehabilitation of small buildings for emergency generators,
           watchmen and workshops; and
   (vi)    improvement of access roads


                                                1
The major work operations identified for their potential environmental impacts are:

    (i)     construction of new spillways to increase, where needed, discharge capacities;
    (ii)    rehabilitation and reconstruction of existing spillways;
    (iii)   slope stabilization and strengthening;
    (iv)    rehabilitation of irrigation outlet; and
    (v)     rehabilitation of access roads.

Construction of new spillways: According to current plans and designs, new spillways will be
required and constructed at 9 dams (Kechut, V. Sasnashen, Gegharkunik-1, Katnaghbiur-2,
Khashtarak-2, Hovk-1, Hovk-2, Hovk 1A, N. Bazmaberd). The new constructions will bring
their total spillway discharge capacity (existing plus new capacities) to socially acceptable levels.
This is badly needed for safety purposes as overtopping is considered the most critical failure
mechanism for embankment dams.
The major environmental issue related to the spillway construction work would be the disposal of
excavated materials (soil, stone, gravel, spoils, etc.). In general, volumes of excavated materials
are relatively small and manageable.

Rehabilitation/Reconstruction of Existing Spillways: Rehabilitation/reconstruction work is
currently planned on 20 existing spillways (Akhurian, Spandarian, Tolors, Shamb, Aghavnadzor,
Tsilkar, Kosh, Agarak, Ashnak-2, Vosketas, Metsavan, Maralik, Khashtarak-1, Getik, Shenik,
Angechakot, Yerevan Lake, N. Talin, Karaglukh, Martiros-1). The work will vary from site to
site from complete reconstruction to minor repair. The major environmental issue of the spillway
rehabilitation/reconstruction work would be the transport and disposal of the concrete rubble and
debris.

Slope Protection/Strengthening: The project is currently expected to improve the slope protection
of 22 dams (Spandarian, Tolors, Aghavnadzor, Tsilkar, Katnaghbiur-1, Davidashen, Talish,
V. Talin-1, Ashnak-2, Maralik, Ashnak-1, Irind, Katnaghbiur-2, V. Sasnashen, Saralich, Artavan,
Khashtarak-2, Hovk-1A, Hatsashen, Shgarshik, V. Talin-2, Gegharkunik-1). Depending on each
case, this would require the strengthening of one (generally, on the reservoir side) or both of the
dam slopes. Damaged slope concrete covers will have to be removed and either disposed off or
reused, if suitable.

Rehabilitation of irrigation outlet: Rehabilitation of irrigation outlet is currently planned on 20
existing dams (Joghaz, Akhurian, Kechut, Shenik, Tsilkar, Aghakchi, Kosh, Talish, V. Talin-1,
Metsavan, Ashnak-1, Gegharkunik-1, Egnik, Hovk-1, Kaps, Aragats, Angechakot, Aknalich,
Yerevan Lake, Hatsashen). The major environmental issue related to the spillway construction
work would be the disposal of excavated materials (soil, stone, gravel, spoils, etc.) and
construction wastes (concrete rubbles and debris). In general, volumes of excavated materials are
relatively small and manageable.
According to current plans and designs, new safety equipments will be installed at all dams
included in this project and no major environmental problems are anticipated during this process.

Rehabilitation of access roads
The project is currently expected to improve the access roads of 16 dams (Aghakchi, Davidashen,
Metsavan, Irind, Agarak, V. Sasnashen, Arpilich, Saralich, Aygedzor, Tavshud, David-Bek,
                                                  2
Aparan, Karnout, Mantash, Hakhoum, Akhurian). The major environmental issue related to the
rehabilitation of access roads would be the disposal of excavated materials (soil, stone, gravel,
spoils, etc.). In general, volumes of excavated materials are small and manageable.

4.    Potential Impacts

Considering the rehabilitation nature of the project and the type of works considered to be carried
out at this stage, the negative impacts on the environment are expected to be insignificant or
minor. Based on the preliminary assessment, these impacts would be limited to:
       (i) The transport and disposal of inert materials and construction concrete rubbles and
              debris; and
       (ii) The use and transport of materials (stone, gravel, soil, etc) from old and/or new
              quarries.
The positive impacts are, on the other hand, expected to be significant. Over 23000 persons
(affected population) would enjoy better protection and safety after completion of the project.
The water resource and the Dam-based socio-economic activities and infrastructures and those in
downstream areas would also be better protected. Dam operations will be better managed and
sustained (reducing the need for new dams and for more impacts on the environment). Dam
warning and emergency systems will be improved and O&M function will be strengthened

5. Mitigation Measures

Based on the preliminary assessment, key mitigation measures recommended under this
preliminary Environmental Management Plan (EMP) are listed as follows per item and issue:

a)     Spillway
     Construction, where possible, of tunnel waterways in place of open trenches which are
      more exposed to hill stone and landslides and garbage dumping and which change/damage
      the landscape;
     Widening, where possible, existing spillways to increase capacity and avoid construction
      of new ones;
     Obtain permits from the Ministry of Nature Protection (MNP) and as needed from the
      local/regional authorities for disposal of excavated materials and construction wastes;
     Obtain permit from the MNP and concerned Local/ Regional Authorities for opening
      and/or use of quarries.
     Transport and disposal of construction concrete rubbles, debris and spoils in approved
      paths and landfills/dump sites;
     Restoration to quasi-original conditions of landscape after completion of construction and
      rehabilitation works.

b)     Slope, outlet
     Reuse of suitable excavated and dredged materials (e.g. from spillway operations) for slope
      protection and strengthening works, limiting the need for old and new quarries;
     Use, where possible, existing quarries for required additional materials;
     Obtain permits from the Ministry of Nature Protection and as needed from the
      local/regional authorities for the opening and/or use of quarries;
     Obtain permits from the Ministry of Nature Protection and as needed from the
      local/regional authorities for disposal of excavated materials and construction wastes;

                                                 3
     Restoration to quasi-original conditions of landscape after completion of construction and
      rehabilitation works and after use of quarries.

c)     Access roads
     Rehabilitation, where possible, of existing access roads avoiding construction of new ones;
     Restoration to quasi-original conditions of landscape after completion of construction and
      rehabilitation.

6.     Environmental management

Mitigation Measures and Institutional Responsibilities for Implementation
For each potential impact Table 1 identifies:
   the proposed mitigation measure(s); and
   the parties or agencies charged with implementing those measures, separated into:
     -- executing agencies, responsible for executing the measure;
     -- supervising agencies, responsible for supervising the executing agencies to ensure
        that they execute the mitigation measures as planned; and
     -- monitoring agencies, in charge of monitoring the extent of implementation and the
        effectiveness of the mitigation measures and of adjusting the program if needed.
The proposed mitigation measures and institutional responsibilities are grouped as follows,
depending on the identity of the monitoring agency:

     World Bank (WB): includes all measures calling on the PIU and associated design
     institutes to obtain EA conclusion, permits for water use and discharge and for the
     disposal of excavated materials, wastes, and demolition debris. The World Bank will
     need to ensure that such permits are obtained from relevant agencies (MNP, Local
     and regional authorities) before the construction works are tendered out;
     PIU: includes all measures implemented by contractors/operators, and other
     institutes, supervised by institutes affiliated with the SCWM, and monitored by the
     PIU; and
     Partner agencies to the PIU and SCWM: includes all measures requiring some sort
     of monitoring by key partners of the PIU/SCWM for this project, in particular the
     MNP and its affiliated agencies (Water Resources Protection Agency, Historic and
     Cultural Monuments Protection Agency, etc.).

7.      Contracting

Most construction phase impacts will be possible to mitigate by including appropriate clauses
into the civil works contacts. Clauses should cover, but not limited to, the following issues:
          Compliance with general national environmental guidelines;
          Protection of Historic-cultural monuments;
          Adequate disposal of construction and excavation wastes;
          Location of construction camps, etc.

The construction site, potential negative impacts, mitigation measures, implementing institutions
and timing are presented in Table 1.
