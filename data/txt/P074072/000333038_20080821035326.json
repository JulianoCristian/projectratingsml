outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: Government ownership of the reform agenda is the\n            single most important factor determining the success of\n            reforms. The performance assessment framework has proven\n            useful for the monitoring of reforms, but linking\n            disbursement decisions to specific actions has been a two\n            edged sword. While in some cases this has helped to\n            accelerate the pace of reaching a specific milestone, in\n            other instances, the processes of dialogue and\n            conditionality have become closely interwoven, crowding out\n            the space for a dispassionate, objective, and non-committal\n            sharing of views. The focus on a large number of actions\n            contained in the performance assessment framework (PAF) may\n            also have reduced the strategic focus of the budget support.\n            There appears to be a tension between broad-based progress,\n            which is necessary to ensure improvements of government\n            institutions and systems, and more focused policy dialogue\n            to align PRSC with the critical bottlenecks to growth and\n            poverty reduction. More focus on public expenditure\n            efficiency and effectiveness, and implementation of policy\n            through the budget may be required. This may require a\n            significant revamping of the public expenditure review (PER)\n            process, to bring it back to supporting effective and timely\n            dialogue on key budget priorities between the government and\n            the development partners."}, "docdt": "2007-06-12T00:00:00Z"}
