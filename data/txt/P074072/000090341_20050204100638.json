At the same\n            time, it also poses significant challenges for the Bank to\n            adjust its internal requirements to the government-led\n            harmonization process on the ground. Weaknesses in\n            government processes such as the poverty monitoring system,\n            or the budget system, impact directly on the ability of the\n            Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) program to present\n            adequate results orientation and monitoring frameworks. It\n            will be important to continue focusing on improvements in\n            the underlying government processes rather than attempting\n            to circumvent these problems and weaknesses by developing\n            separate PRSC processes."}, "docdt": "2005-01-27T00:00:00Z"}
