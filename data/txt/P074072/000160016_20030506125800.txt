Summary 
The 
United 
Republic 
of 
Tanzania 
US$132 
million 
($100 
million 
IDA 
Credit 
and 
$32 
million

Standard 
IDA 
terms: 
40-year 
maturity 
with 
a 1 
0-year grace 
period 
The 
proposed 
operation 
of 
US$132 
million 
is 
a 
Poverty Reduction 
Support 
Credit 
(PRSC) 
that 
would 
build 
on 
recent 
reforms 
undertaken 
by 
the 
United 
Republic 
of 
Tanzania 
and 
support 
the 
implementation 
of 
Tanzania’s 
Poverty Reduction 
Strategy 
(PRS) 
as 
summarized 
in 
the 
Poverty  Reduction 
Strategy  Paper 
(PRSP) 
and 
subsequent 
updates 
undertaken 
with 
annual progress 
reports. 
The 
first 
PRSC 
would 
focus 
on 
private 
sector 
development 
and 
public 
sector  management 
to 
complete 
and 
deepen 
the 
reform 
agenda 
defined 
under 
the 
Programmatic Structural 
Adjustment 
Credit 
(PSAC) 
and 
lay 
the 
ground 
for 
attacking 
income 
poverty 
more 
aggressively. 
It 
is 
envisaged 
that 
there 
will 
be 
at  least 
two 
further 
single-tranche  PRSCs 
(each 
up 
to 
US$lSO 
million 
equivalent) 
in 
FY04 
and 
FY05. 
The 
operation 
will 
support 
the 
implementation 
of 
Tanzania’s 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy 
by: 
(i) 
Accelerating growth: 
After 
nearly 
a decade 
of 
macro 
stabilization, 
structural 
reform 
and 
liberalization, 
the 
rate 
of 
growth 
of 
the 
Tanzanian 
economy 
remains 
low 
relative 
to 
the 
requirements 
for 
effective 
poverty 
reduction 
and 
the 
achievement 
of 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals. 
A 
key 
target therefore 
is 
to 
raise 
growth to 
between 
6 
and 
7 
percent 
in 
the 
medium 
term 
by 
promoting 
higher private 
investment, 
reducing 
the 
cost 
of 
doing 
business, 
and enhancing 
the 
efficiency 
of 
the 
Tanzanian 
economy. 
(ii) 
Broadening 
the 
impact 
of 
growth: 
About 
half 
of 
Tanzania’s 
output 
derives 
from 
the 
rural 
economy 
and 
more than 
70 
percent 
of 
its 
population 
depends 
on 
it 
for 
its 
livelihood. 
Most 
of 
the 
reforms 
to 
date 
have 
had 
a 
stronger 
impact 
in 
the 
urban 
and 
service 
sectors. 
Hence 
the 
program 
of 
PRSCs 
will 
support 
efforts 
to 
spread 
the 
impact 
of 
both 
reforms 
and 
resultant 
growth 
to 
the 
rural 
income 
poor 
through: 
Enhancement 
of 
the 
profitability 
of 
agriculture broadly 
and 
export 
products 
of 
rural  origin 
in 
particular,  through 
better 
quality, 
higher 
productivity, 
reduced 
marketing 
cost 
and 
improved 
access 
to 
markets.

Benefits: 
Risk: 
Removal 
of 
remaining 
institutional 
constraints 
on 
rural 
activities; 
0 
Correcting 
the 
disincentives 
arising 
from 
the 
overall  tax 
regime, 
specially 
those 
resulting 
from 
the 
overbearing/multiplicity 
of 
local 
taxes 
affecting 
income 
earning 
activities 
in 
rural 
areas. 
(iii) 
Aligning  public 
investment 
with 
PRS 
goals: 
In 
addition 
to 
continued 
efforts 
at 
improving 
the 
private 
investment 
climate, 
there 
is 
now 
a 
need 
to 
bring 
the 
development 
budget 
of 
the government 
in 
line 
with 
the 
strategic 
public 
investment 
requirements 
to 
meet 
the  PRS 
targets  and  support 
the 
growth 
of 
private 
sector 
contribution 
to 
the 
economy and 
livelihoods. 
(iv) 
Increasing 
efficiency 
of 
public 
service 
delivery: 
Building 
on 
processes 
that have 
been 
put 
in 
place 
to 
enhance 
the 
strategic 
allocation 
and 
impact 
of 
public 
resources 
for 
poverty 
reduction, 
increase 
the 
efficiency 
of 
public 
resource 
use 
through 
measures 
to 
further 
strengthen 
accountability 
mechanisms 
combined 
with 
capacity 
building 
at 
the 
local 
and 
central 
government 
level.

proposed 
series

PRSCs 
will 
help 
the 
United 
Republic 
of 
Tanzania 
to 
implement 
the 
PRS 
and 
reach 
the 
goals 
set 
out 
in 
the 
strategy. 
The 
reforms 
supported 
by 
the 
operation 
will 
help 
to 
raise 
growth, 
make 
progress 
towards 
achieving 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals  and 
strengthen 
the 
institutional  infrastructure 
needed 
to 
improve 
the 
public 
sector’s 
capacity 
to 
carry 
out 
its 
role 
more  effectively, 
as 
envisioned 
in 
the 
PRS. 
Improved 
delivery 
of 
public 
services 
is 
essential 
if 
the 
United 
Republic 
of 
Tanzania 
is 
to 
reach 
its 
goals 
for 
poverty 
reduction 
and 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
life 
in 
Tanzania. 
Several 
risks 
pertain 
to 
the 
reform 
program 
supported 
under 
PRSC 
1 
: 
0 
As 
the 
next 
round 
of 
elections 
approaches, 
concerns 
with 
the 
durability 
of 
commitment 
to 
reforms 
will 
mount. 
To 
mitigate 
this 
risk, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
lock 
in 
reforms 
undertaken 
by 
the 
United 
Republic 
of 
Tanzania through 
legal 
and 
institutional 
changes 
to 
root 
these 
reforms 
deeply 
both 
in 
attitude 
and 
practice. 
As 
policy-making 
has become 
more inclusive 
with 
a 
greater 
role 
for 
stakeholders 
beyond 
the 
executive, 
in 
particular 
parliament, 
decision-making 
processes 
have 
tended 
to 
become 
more 
drawn 
out. 
This 
poses 
primarily 
a 
risk 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
speed 
of 
implementation 
of 
agreed actions, 
while 
it 
reduces 
the 
risk 
of 
policy 
reversals. 
Another 
risk 
for 
the achievement 
of 
PRS 
objectives 
arises 
from 
the 
ongoing 
decentralization 
process, 
which 
shifts 
responsibility 
for 
key 
poverty reducing 
programs 
in 
education,  health, 
the 
water 
sector, 
and 
agriculture  to 
the 
districts. 
While 
systems 
and 
capacities 
at 
the 
central 
level 
are 
generally 
stronger 
than 
at 
the

local 
level, 
limited 
human 
resource 
capacities 
to 
implement 
and 
manage 
the 
PRSC 
reform 
agenda 
represent 
another 
risk, especially 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
public 
expenditure 
management, 
procurement, 
and 
financial 
management. 
To 
ensure 
that 
such 
risks 
do 
not 
derail 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
PRS 
and 
PRSC, 
appropriate 
monitoring 
instruments 
have 
been 
put 
in 
place. 
Tanzania’s  annual 
PRS 
progress 
report, 
which builds 
on 
a 
recently 
developed comprehensive 
poverty 
monitoring 
system, 
and 
a 
well-established 
annual 
public 
expenditure 
review 
mechanism 
provide 
open 
and 
transparent 
arrangements 
for 
monitoring 
outcomes 
and 
fiduciary 
risks. 
Moreover, 
the 
annual 
nature 
of 
the 
PRSC 
provides 
a 
framework 
for 
appraising 
risks 
identified 
in 
the 
CFAA 
and 
CPAR 
and 
agreeing 
on 
necessary 
corrective 
actions 
as 
necessary. 
Estimated 
Disbursements: 
SDR 
96.4 
million 
(US$132 
million 
equivalent) 
will 
be 
disbursed upon

effectiveness.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
1. 
This 
program 
document 
presents 
a single-tranche 
Poverty Reduction 
Support 
Credit 
and 
Grant 
(PRSC1) 
to 
the 
United 
Republic 
of 
Tanzania 
in 
the 
amount 
of 
SDR 
96.4 
million 
(US$l32million 
equivalent). 
The 
proposed 
operation selectively 
supports 
the 
implementation 
of 
key 
priority 
areas 
of 
Tanzania’s 
poverty reduction 
strategy 
(PRS), 
as 
set 
out 
in 
the 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy Paper 
(PRSP) 
prepared 
in 
2000 
and 
its 
subsequent 
updates 
in 
the 
first 
and 
second 
PRS 
progress 
reports. 
PRSCl 
is 
the 
first 
of 
a 
series 
of 
three annual PRSC operations. 
A 
key 
feature 
of 
the 
Tanzania 
PRSC 
framework 
is 
a 
focus 
on 
cross-cutting 
and 
institutional 
issues. 
Reforms 
in 
Tanzania 
have 
run 
ahead 
of 
the 
required 
changes 
in 
legal 
and 
institutional 
frameworks. 
To 
reduce 
risks 
of 
reversal, 
the 
PRSC 
program 
places 
particular 
emphasis 
on 
locking 
in 
gains made 
to 
date 
through 
bringing 
both 
the 
legal 
and 
the 
institutional 
frameworks 
in 
line 
with 
the 
achievements 
in 
reforms. 
Sector-specific 
issues 
will 
continue 
to 
be 
dealt 
with 
in 
the 
context 
of 
sector-wide 
programs.  Section 
1V.C 
of 
the 
document 
provides 
details 
about 
complementary 
sector 
programs 
supported 
by 
development 
partners 
including 
the 
World 
Bank. 
The PRSC 
framework 
places a 
strong 
emphasis 
on 
monitoring 
results 
from 
sector 
programs. 
Hence,  a 
number 
of 
agreed  actions  focus 
on 
strengthening 
the 
capacity  and 
institutional 
framework 
for 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
(M&E). 
2. 
Over 
the 
past 
few 
years, 
the 
PRS 
has 
become 
the 
overarching framework 
for policymaking 
in 
and 
donor 
support 
to 
Tanzania. 
The 
second 
annual 
PRS progress 
report 
documents progress 
in 
fine-tuning 
and 
implementing 
the 
PRS 
with 
a 
clearly identifiable impact 
on 
poverty 
and 
social 
indicators 
in 
some 
areas. 
However, 
based 
on 
the 
results 
of 
the 
recently 
completed  2000/01 
household 
budget 
survey 
(HBS), 
the 
progress 
report 
also documents 
deeply 
entrenched 
income 
poverty affecting 
about 
35 
percent 
of 
all 
Tanzanians 
and 
continued 
severe 
deprivation 
as 
reflected 
by 
a 
variety 
of 
poverty 
and 
social 
indicators. 
The report 
has 
also 
shed 
new 
light 
on 
regional 
variations 
in 
poverty 
within 
Tanzania that 
have 
important 
implications for 
the 
PRS. 
Preliminary 
poverty 
and social 
impact 
assessments 
have been 
carried out 
for 
the 
Tanzania 
Poverty 
and 
Human 
Development Report 
(PEIDR) 
by 
the 
Research 
and 
Analysis 
Working 
Group 
under 
the 
Tanzania 
Poverty 
Monitoring 
System. 
The 
government 
has 
agreed 
with 
the 
Bank to 
carry out 
in 
fiscal 
2004 
a 
poverty 
and social 
impact 
assessment 
(PSIA)  and 
a 
poverty 
vulnerability 
study 
to 
strengthen 
analyses 
carried 
out 
so 
far 
and 
establish a stronger baseline 
for 
future 
monitoring. 
3. 
A 
solid 
track 
record 
of 
good 
macroeconomic performance 
coupled 
with 
ongoing reforms 
to 
enhance 
public 
sector 
performance and 
facilitate private 
sector 
activities 
has 
resulted 
in 
sustained 
economic 
growth 
in 
the 
range 
of 
4.0 
to 
5.8 
percent 
over 
the past 
five 
years, 
up 
from 
an 
average 
of 
1.6 
percent 
during 
the 
first 
half 
of 
the 
1990s. 
Although 
these 
reforms 
need 
to 
be 
sustained 
and 
deepened, 
the 
focus 
of 
reform 
efforts 
is 
now 
on 
aligning 
government 
policies and 
expenditure 
programs 
with 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
PRS 
and enhancing 
the 
efficiency 
of 
public 
service 
delivery.

THE 
LINK 
BETWEEN 
THE 
TANZANIA 
PRSC 
AND 
PROGRAMMATIC 
STRUCTURAL 
ADJUSTMENT 
CREDIT 
(PSAC) 
4. 
The 
Tanzania 
PSAC 
supports 
the 
government’s 
efforts 
to 
sustain 
macroeconomic 
stability, 
strengthen 
financial 
accountability, 
deepen 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
privatization 
program, 
improve 
competitiveness 
and transparency 
of 
markets, and 
further 
reduce 
barriers 
to 
internal 
and 
international 
trade. 
The 
Letter 
of 
Development 
Policy for 
PSACl 
identified 
a 
set 
of 
actions 
in 
these 
areas 
to 
be 
implemented over 
a 
four-year 
period. 
PSAC 
1 
supports 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
initial 
two-year 
phase 
of 
this 
program. 
Implementation 
of 
the 
reform 
agenda has 
been 
satisfactory 
and 
the 
operation 
is 
expected 
to 
close 
on 
June 
30, 
2003, 
with 
all 
agreed actions 
completed and 
all 
tranches released. 
Achievements 
include 
an increase 
in 
real per capita 
spending 
in 
the 
priority 
sectors (basic  education, 
primary 
health, water, 
rural 
roads, 
judiciary, 
and 
agricultural 
research 
and  extension) 
by 
an  estimated 
84 
percent 
over 
the 
period 
fiscal 
2001 
- 
2003,  successful 
concessioning 
of 
the 
Dar 
es 
Salaam 
Water 
and 
Sewage 
Authority 
(DAWASA)  to 
a 
private 
operator, 
making 
the 
Integrated 
Financial 
Management 
System 
(IFMS) 
fully 
operational  at 
the 
central 
government 
level, 
reforming 
legislation 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
procurement and 
land, 
liberalizing 
crop 
movements 
within 
and 
across 
international 
borders, 
rationalizing 
the 
tax  regime 
and 
a 
variety 
of 
measures 
to 
strengthen 
the 
business 
and 
regulatory 
environment, 
and make 
progress 
in 
the 
privatization 
of 
public 
enterprises 
and 
utilities. 
5. 
The 
PRSC 
for 
Tanzania 
will 
deepen 
the 
reform 
agenda 
supported 
by 
PSAC 
1 
and 
include 
new 
areas 
of 
activity, 
mainly 
aimed 
at 
scaling 
up 
growth 
and  broadening 
its 
impact 
on 
poverty 
reduction,  and 
a 
sharper 
focus 
on 
achieving 
results 
from 
public 
spending. 
The 
switch 
from 
a 
PSAC 
to 
a 
PRSC 
also 
addresses 
Box 
1: 
From 
Adjustment 
to 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Support 
The 
transition 
from 
adjustment 
lending 
to 
poverty reduction 
support 
is 
grounded 
in 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
PRS 
as 
the 
guiding 
policy 
framework 
and  Tanzania’s 
success 
in 
achieving 
macroeconomic 
stabilization 
and 
removing 
key 
structural 
constraints 
in 
the 
economy. 
The 
PRSC 
fully 
embraces 
the 
principles 
underlying 
the 
PRS, 
which 
are 
reflected 
in 
the 
design 
of 
the  operation. 
Foremost, 
the 
PRSC 
takes 
seriously 
the 
central 
role 
of 
the 
PES 
as 
the 
guiding 
framework. 
While 
adjustment 
lending 
relied 
primarily on 
externally 
monitored, 
ex-ante 
policy 
conditionality, 
the 
PESC 
seeks 
to 
reinforce 
government 
ownership 
and 
the 
role 
of 
local 
stakeholders 
by 
emphasizing 
the 
role 
of 
local 
processes 
for 
policy 
design, 
implementation, 
and 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation. 
The 
PRSC 
fully 
reflects 
the 
importance 
of 
a transparent 
and 
participatory 
approach 
to 
policy 
making 
to 
sustain 
good 
policies 
and 
build 
institutional 
capacitv. 
several 
lessons learned 
during 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
PSAC. 
Key 
among 
these 
is 
the 
adoption 
of 
a 
single 
tranche, 
ex 
post 
conditionality 
framework, 
which 
avoids uncertainty 
in 
disbursement 
linked 
to 
within-year 
conditionality. 
The 
PSAC 
experience 
illustrated 
the 
potential 
of 
ex 
post 
conditionality 
to 
introduce 
additional  uncertainty 
into 
resource 
flows, 
often 
as 
a 
result 
of 
circumstances 
outside the 
direct 
control 
of 
government, 
such 
as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
privatization 
of 
the 
Dar 
es 
Salaam 
Water 
and 
Sewage 
Authority. 
In 
addition, 
the 
PRSC approach also 
provides 
more 
flexibility 
to 
react 
to 
changing 
circumstances 
in 
the 
design 
of 
consecutive 
PRSCs; 
under the 
PSAC, 
it 
was 
difficult 
to 
make 
such adjustment 
to 
the 
agreed 
conditionality. 
6. 
Continuity 
and 
deepening 
of 
the 
PSAC 
agenda 
will 
be 
mainly 
through  supporting 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Business 
Environment 
Strengthening 
for 
Tanzania 
(BEST) 
program and 
carrying 
over 
the 
PSAC 
components 
explicitly into 
the 
PRSC 
program. 
In 
2002, 
the government 
of 
Tanzania 
(GOT) 
approved 
a 
program 
for 
reducing 
the 
administrative 
burden 
on 
businesses 
and 
offering 
improved 
public 
services 
to 
the 
private 
sector. 
This 
program 
builds 
on 
the 
PSAC 
reform 
2 
Page  13
agenda 
by 
carrying forward 
commitments 
made 
in 
the 
PSACl 
Letter 
of 
Development 
Policy. 
The 
program 
also  incorporates 
results 
from 
a 
two-year 
consultative 
process 
under 
the 
integrated 
framework 
for 
trade 
to 
identify 
major 
constraints 
facing 
business operations 
in 
Tanzania. 
The 
core 
components 
of 
the 
five-year 
program 
aim 
at 
radical 
reduction 
of 
administrative 
complications  currently 
faced 
by 
businesses 
through 
streamlining  regulatory 
and 
licensing 
procedures, 
improving 
commercial 
dispute 
resolution, 
strengthening 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
Tanzania 
Investment 
Center 
for 
unencumbered 
facilitation 
of 
private 
investment,  and 
changing 
the 
government 
culture 
for 
more  positive  interaction 
with 
the 
private 
sector. 
Program 
implementation 
will 
be supported 
by 
a 
multidonor 
basket 
fund. 
7. 
Three 
other 
parts 
of 
the 
PSAC  reform 
agenda-efficient 
delivery 
of 
public 
services, 
improved 
public 
expenditure 
management, 
and 
improved 
public 
financial 
management-are 
carried 
forward 
as 
separate 
components 
of 
the 
PRSC 
program. 
The 
residual 
privatization 
and 
regulatory framework program 
will 
continue 
to 
be 
supported 
under 
the 
Bank’s 
privatization 
and 
private 
sector 
development 
project 
and 
respective sector 
projects after 
SAC 
1 
and 
PSAC 
1 
have 
successfully supported 
privatization 
of 
telecoms, 
the 
National 
Bank 
of 
Commerce, and 
nearly 
200 
commercial  production 
entities  (industrial, 
services, 
and 
agricultural); 
selection 
of 
private 
operators 
for 
the 
Dar 
es 
Salaam 
water 
supply, 
container 
terminal, 
and 
Tanzania 
Railway 
Corporation;  and 
setting 
up 
of 
the 
multisector umbrella  framework 
and 
respective 
laws 
for 
regulating 
utilities, 
transportation, telecommunications, 
civil 
aviation, 
and broadcasting. 
B. 
INNOVATIONS 
UNDER 
THE 
TANZANIA 
PRSC 
8. 
The 
innovations 
under 
the 
proposed 
operation 
are 
in 
two 
broad 
areas. 
First, 
it 
supports a 
shift 
of 
policy 
focus 
from 
mainly 
ensuring 
that 
expenditure allocations 
are 
in 
line 
with 
agreed 
priorities 
to 
putting 
greater emphasis 
on 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
expenditure 
programs 
and 
holding 
sectors 
accountable 
for 
results 
and 
outcomes 
of 
programs 
through 
a 
strong 
M&E 
system. 
The 
focus 
on 
results includes 
monitoring 
progress 
toward achieving 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals 
(MDGs) 
within 
Tanzania’s 
Poverty 
Monitoring 
System. 
Second, 
it 
supports greater 
focus 
on 
pro-poor 
growth 
policy 
reforms, especially 
those 
affecting 
rural 
incomes. 
Previously, 
the focus 
was 
on 
attacking 
poverty 
through 
social 
sector 
programs, 
but 
little 
progress 
has 
been 
made 
in 
reducing income 
poverty, 
particularly 
in 
rural 
areas. 
9. 
Sectoral 
issues  are 
left 
for 
implementation 
under 
specific 
sector  programs, 
but 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
their 
spending 
and 
impact 
on 
poverty 
is 
monitored 
under 
the 
PRSC 
program. 
Sector 
programs 
are 
in 
place 
for 
the 
education,  health, 
and 
agriculture 
sectors 
and 
under 
development 
for 
the 
roads 
and water 
sectors. 
These 
sector 
programs 
enjoy 
broad 
donor support 
and 
are 
the 
government’s 
preferred 
instrument 
for 
donor  coordination. 
The 
sector 
reviews 
undertaken 
each year 
under the sector-wide 
approach 
(SWAP) 
will 
pay particular 
attention 
to 
poverty 
reduction 
targets 
and 
their 
achievements and 
not 
just 
to 
accounting 
for 
inputs 
and 
outputs 
delivered. 
A 
major 
objective 
of 
this 
framework 
is 
to 
ensure 
consistency 
between 
sector 
development programs and the PRS 
as 
well 
as 
enhance 
and 
incentivize 
capacity 
for monitoring 
results. 
To 
the 
extent 
possible, 
the 
annual 
and 
periodic 
monitoring 
indicators 
for 
the 
results 
will 
be 
calibrated 
against 
indicators 
for 
the 
MDGs. 
Feasible annual  indicators, 
as 
well 
as 
periodic 
quantitative 
indicators, 
for 
assessing 
progress 
toward 
meeting 
the 
PRS targets 
have 
been 
agreed 
after consultations among 
stakeholders, 
including 
the 
priority 
sector 
groups 
in 
Tanzania, 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the

ALIGNMENT 
WITH 
OTHER 
DEVELOPMENT 
PARTNERS 
IN 
SUPPORTING 
TANZANIA’S 
PRS 
10. 
Donor 
assistance 
plays 
an 
important 
role 
in 
supporting the  implementation 
of 
the  PRS 
because 
Tanzania’s 
own 
resources 
are 
insufficient 
to 
reach 
the 
PRS objectives.  Tanzania 
has 
made 
significant 
progress 
in 
enhancing 
its 
public 
expenditure 
management, 
including 
a 
highly 
consultative 
public 
expenditure 
review 
and 
medium-term 
expenditure 
framework (PER-MTEF) 
process, 
the  progressive 
implementation 
of 
a 
robust  integrated 
financial 
management 
system 
(IFMS), 
and 
measures 
to 
fight 
corruption. 
This 
has 
provided 
the 
impetus 
to 
a 
group 
of 
11 donors 
to 
provide 
budget support 
through 
the 
Poverty Reduction 
Budget 
Support 
(PRBS) 
facility. 
Policy 
dialogue and 
decisions 
on 
disbursements 
take 
place 
in 
the 
context 
of 
a 
common 
performance 
assessment 
framework 
(PAF) 
’ 
linked 
to 
the 
annual PRS progress reports. 
The 
proposed 
PRSC 
aims 
to 
fully 
align 
the 
Bank’s 
budget 
support 
with 
the well-established 
and effective budget 
support 
review 
and 
disbursement 
mechanisms 
of 
other 
d 
onors.

RECENT ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENTS 
AND 
PROGRESS 
IN 
POVERTY 
REDUCTION 
A. 
Macroeconomic 
and 
Social Progress 
Improvement 
in 
Macroeconomic 
Performance 
1 
1. 
GDP 
growth: 
Tanzania’s 
macroeconomic performance 
has 
continued 
to 
improve 
during 
2000, 2001, 
and 2002 
(see 
annexes 
1 and 
3). 
The 
annual 
growth 
rate’ 
increased 
to 
4.9 
percent 
in 
2000, 
further 
to 
5.6 
percent 
in 
2001, 
and 
is 
projected 
at 
5.9 
percent 
in 
2002 
despite 
the 
negative 
effects 
on 
commodity 
prices 
and 
tourism 
of 
the 
slowdown 
in 
the 
world 
economy. 
The 
rise 
in 
growth 
during 
2001 
and 
2002 
was 
led 
by 
relatively 
strong performance 
in 
agriculture, 
mining, 
and  wholesale 
and 
retail 
trade. 
The 
impact 
of 
market 
reforms, 
good rainfall, 
and 
improved 
markets, 
particularly 
for  food 
crops 
in 
the 
neighboring 
countries, 
has 
combined 
to 
raise 
agriculture 
growth 
at 
6.5 
percent 
in 
2001 
and an estimated 
5.5 
percent 
in 
2002. 
Growth 
in 
the 
mining 
sector 
remained 
strong 
in 
2001 
at 
13.5 
percent, 
raising 
its 
overall contribution 
to 
GDP 
to 
2.5 
percent 
from 
negligible 
levels 
five 
years ago. 
Wholesale and 
retail 
trade 
(including 
tourism) 
grew 
at 
7.0 
percent. 
Industry 
(manufacturing, 
utilities, 
construction, 
transport, 
and 
communication) 
grew 
at an 
average 
of 
nearly 
6 percent, 
posting 
improvements 
in 
all 
subsectors 
over  1999 
and 
2000 
except 
for 
construction, 
which 
had 
peaked 
earlier 
during 
the 
height 
of 
investment 
in 
gold 
mining. 
Private 
sector 
growth, 
beyond 
mining 
and 
tourism, 
has 
been 
slower 
in 
responding 
to 
the 
liberalization. 
12. 
External 
sector: 
In 
the external 
sector, 
total 
receipts 
from 
export 
of 
goods and services 
increased 
from 
about 
US$1.33 
billion 
in 
2000 
to 
about 
US$1.56 
billion 
in 
2001,  and 
they 
are 
estimated 
to 
have 
increased 
to 
US$1.53 
billion 
in 
2002. 
The 
volume 
of 
traditional  export 
’ 
The PRSC 
policy 
matrix 
(or 
PAF) 
provides a 
substantially harmonized 
set 
of 
policy 
actions 
in 
support 
of 
the 
PRS. 
In 
the 
context 
of 
the 
PRSC, 
both 
the PRBS 
donors 
and 
the 
World 
Bank 
will 
avoid introducing 
new 
targets, 
indicators, 
or 
measures 
that 
are 
outside 
the 
PAF 
and the 
IMF 
macroeconomic 
annex. 
It 
is 
the 
intention 
of 
the parties 
to 
harmonize the 
PRS 
action 
plan 
and 
the 
PAF 
completely 
within 
three 
years. 
The 
PAF 
will 
be used 
as 
a 
tool 
for 
dialogue 
on 
PRS 
implementation 
and progress, 
and 
PAF 
actions 
will 
help 
to 
determine appropriate 
levels 
of 
future 
funding for 
the 
general budget. 
Through a 
continuous 
process, 
it will 
allow 
the government 
and 
the 
donors 
to 
assess 
progress 
toward 
agreed 
medium-term objectives 
and the 
implementation 
status 
of 
specific 
measures.

commodities 
has 
declined, 
caused 
partly 
by 
lower 
commodity 
prices. Nonetheless, 
the 
value 
of 
merchandise exports 
grew 
by 
17 
percent 
in 
2001 
as 
a 
result 
of 
a 
sharp 
increase 
in 
nontraditional 
exports, 
mainly 
gold. 
Tanzania’s 
gold 
export 
increased 
from 
US$112.6 
million 
in 
2000 
to 
US$250.4 
million 
in 
2001. 
Imports 
grew 
by 
11.5 
percent, 
reflecting 
higher 
imports 
of 
capital 
goods 
as 
well 
as 
higher 
recorded 
imports 
of 
petroleum 
products. 
Foreign direct 
investment 
(FDI4 
had 
reached  a  peak 
in 
2000, 
with 
inflows 
of 
US$463 
million,  mainly 
on 
account 
of 
large 
investment 
in 
the 
mining 
sector. 
Since 
then, 
some 
of 
the 
largest investments 
in 
the 
mining 
sector 
have been 
completed 
and 
gold 
production 
has 
come 
on 
stream and supported  an increase 
in 
exports. 
As 
a 
consequence, 
FDI 
has 
declined 
to 
US$327 
million 
in 
2001 and 
a 
projected 
US$240 
million 
in 
2002 
and  beyond. 
Despite 
the 
decline, 
foreign 
investment 
inflows 
are 
still 
high 
compared 
with 
levels before 
1995, 
at 
less 
than 
US$50 
million 
annually, 
and compared 
with 
other 
countries 
in 
the 
region. 
The 
current 
account 
deficit 
(before  grants) 
of 
the 
balance 
of 
payments 
declined 
from 
12 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
1999 
to 
less 
than 
10 
percent 
of 
GDP 
since 2000, 
reflecting 
in 
particular 
the 
coming 
on 
stream 
of 
gold 
exports. 
These 
developments 
contributed 
to 
a 
further 
strengthening 
of 
international 
reserves. 
At 
the end 
of 
October 
2002, 
international 
reserves 
stood 
at 
US$1.3 
billion, 
equivalent 
to 
seven 
months 
of 
imports 
of 
goods and 
nonfactor 
services. 
The 
exchange 
rate 
against 
the 
U.S. 
dollar 
continued 
to 
depreciate 
between 
2000 
and 
2002. 
13. 
External 
debt 
and 
debt 
management: 
Tanzania 
reached 
the 
completion 
point 
under the 
enhanced 
Heavily 
Indebted Poor 
Countries 
Initiative 
(HIPC) 
in 
November 
200 
1. 
Along 
with 
the 
HIPC 
assistance 
from 
IDA 
and the 
International 
Monetary 
Fund 
(IMF), 
which 
together 
account 
for 
more 
than 
40 
percent 
of 
the 
total, 
the 
Paris 
Club 
creditors 
provided 
another 
40 percent 
by 
granting 
a stock 
of 
debt 
reduction 
on 
Cologne 
terms 
in 
January 2002. Issues 
remain 
in 
obtaining 
comparable treatment 
from 
non-Paris 
Club 
creditors. 
Tanzania 
has 
also 
taken 
significant 
steps 
to 
deal 
with 
its 
domestic 
debt, 
particularly 
by 
reducing 
its 
arrears 
with 
the 
private 
sector 
and 
private 
external  commercial 
debt.  Tanzania’s 
debt 
management 
is 
strengthened 
through 
the 
recent 
adoption 
of 
the 
National 
Debt 
Strategy and 
the 
amendment 
of 
the 
Loans, Guarantees 
and 
Grants 
Act 
of 
1974. 
The 
strategy emphasizes 
avoiding 
a relapse 
to 
the 
situation 
of 
unsustainable debt. 
Among 
the 
important 
elements 
under 
this 
strategy 
are 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
National 
Debt 
Management 
Committee 
and 
the 
vesting 
of 
the  government 
to 
raise 
money 
by 
loan,  issue 
guarantees, 
and 
accept grants 
on 
behalf 
of 
the government 
solely 
in 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance. 
14. 
Debt 
sustainability: 
Tanzania’s 
public 
and 
publicly 
guaranteed 
external 
debt 
is 
sustainable, 
having 
completed 
all 
required conditions 
and obtained irrevocable 
debt 
relief 
under 
the enhanced 
HIPC 
Initiative 
(amounting 
to 
US$3 
billion). 
Debt 
relief 
granted 
to 
Tanzania 
under 
the 
enhanced 
HIPC 
Initiative 
(decision 
point 
2000 
and 
completion 
point 
2001) 
was 
crucial 
in 
achieving 
debt 
sustainability 
and 
enhancing 
the 
resource 
base 
that 
can 
be 
used 
in 
the 
pursuit 
of 
the 
MDGs. 
Sound macroeconomic and structural 
policies 
created 
the 
basis 
for qualifying for 
debt 
relief. 
The 
revised 
net 
present 
value (NPV) 
of 
the 
debt-to-export 
ratio 
for 
2001/02 
was 127.8 
percent, 
which 
is 
considerably 
lower 
than 
projected 
during 
the 
decision 
and 
completion 
points. 
The 
improvement 
in 
debt 
sustainability 
reflects 
not only 
higher 
exports 
and 
lower 
than 
expected 
new 
borrowings, 
but 
also 
additional 
debt 
relief from 
Paris 
Club 
creditors 
beyond 
the 
HIPC 
Initiative. 
By 
201 
1/12, 
the 
NPV 
of 
the 
debt-to-export 
ratio 
will 
decline 
further 
to 
117 percent; 
debt 
as 
a 
proportion 
of 
GDP 
is 
projected 
to 
decline 
moderately, 
fkom 
18.3 
percent 
from 
2001/02 
to 
17.7 
percent 
in 
201 
1/12, 
and 
the 
NPV 
of 
debt 
to 
revenue 
is 
projected 
to 
decline 
from 
155 
percent 
in 
2001/02 
to 
122 
percent 
in 
201 
1/12. 
Continued sustainability 
of 
Tanzania’s external 
debt 
is 
contingent 
on 
the 
These 
figures 
are 
revised 
estimates 
of 
FDI

on 
the 
results 
of 
a capital 
flow 
survey 
undertaken 
by 
the 
Tanzania 
Investment 
Center and 
the 
Bank 
of 
Tanzania. 
Previously published 
estimates 
had 
been 
significantly 
lower, 
partly 
because 
of 
an 
underestimation 
of 
investment 
in 
the 
mining 
sector.

sustained

of 
macroeconomic 
and 
structural 
reform 
policies 
as 
well 
as 
prudent 
management 
of 
external 
debt. 
15. 
Fiscal 
management: 
Continued 
conservative 
fiscal 
policy 
management,  supported 
by 
cautious monetary 
policy, contributed 
to 
a 
decline 
in 
inflation 
from 
7.0 
percent 
at 
the 
end 
of 
1999 
to 
4.9 
percent 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2001 
and 
further 
to 
4.4 
percent 
by 
the 
end 
of 
September 
2002. 
The 
deficit-to-GDP4 
outturn (including 
grants) 
in 
200 1/02 
was  1.1 
percent and 
represents 
a 
smaller 
deficit 
than 
budgeted. 
It 
is 
projected 
to 
be 
4.1 
percent 
in 
2002/03 
because 
of 
a substantial increase 
in 
priority 
expenditures 
and 
a 
better 
capture 
of 
foreign-financed 
development expenditure 
in 
the 
budget. 
It 
is 
projected 
to 
decline 
to 
3.6 
percent 
in 
2003/04. 
Domestic 
revenue 
and 
total 
expenditure 
ratios 
to 
GDP 
in 
2001/02 
were 
slightly 
higher 
than 
in 
the 
previous 
year, 
rising 
from 
12.1 
to 
12.2 
percent 
and 
from 
17.3 
to 
18.1 
percent, 
respectively. 
The 
revenue-to-GDP 
ratio 
is 
expected 
to 
increase 
to 
12.3 
percent 
in 
2002/03  and 
further 
to 
12.8 
percent 
in 
2003/04. 
The 
government 
is 
committed 
to 
increasing 
its 
tax 
revenue 
as 
a 
means 
to 
gradually 
reduce 
its 
dependence 
on 
official 
development 
assistance. 
The 
budget 
for 
fiscal 
2003 
included 
further 
steps 
in 
the 
ongoing 
tax 
reform 
to 
promote private 
investment 
and 
private 
sector 
growth, 
as 
well 
as 
to 
enhance 
competitiveness and 
transparency 
of 
the 
import 
regime. 
16. 
Fiscal 
sustainability: 
Over 
the 
past 
three 
years, 
the 
level 
and 
composition 
of 
foreign 
aid 
to 
Tanzania 
has 
changed 
in 
a 
number 
of 
important 
ways. Grants 
and soft loans 
(net) 
to 
Tanzania 
have increased 
from 
4 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
fiscal 
1997 
to 
5.9 percent 
in 
fiscal 
2002. Part 
of 
the 
increase 
in 
fiscal 
2002 
is 
attributed 
to 
better 
recording 
of 
aid. 
As 
a 
proportion 
of 
the 
total 
budget, 
official 
development 
assistance 
(ODA) 
accounts 
for 
about 
40 
percent, 
registering 
a 
significant 
rise 
in 
fiscal 2001 
and 
fiscal 
2002. 
Grant 
financing 
was 
relatively 
stable at 
around 
4 
percent 
of 
GDP, 
and 
loan 
disbursements 
recovered 
from 
a 
relatively 
low 
level 
of 
1.6 
percent 
in 
fiscal 
1999 
to 
2.2 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
fiscal 
2000 
and 
fiscal 
2001. 
Inflows from 
concessional  loans 
net 
of 
amortization 
have increased 
continuously 
over 
the 
past 
three 
years, 
from 
0.4 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
fiscal 
1999 
to 
1.1 
percent 
in 
fiscal 
2001. 
Until 
fiscal 
1999, 
project 
support was 
increasing and 
program 
support 
was  decreasing. 
This 
trend 
has 
been 
reversed 
in 
the 
past 
two 
years, 
with 
a 
decline 
in 
project 
support 
and 
an 
increase 
in 
program 
support, 
which 
is 
even 
more 
pronounced 
when 
HIPC 
debt 
relief 
is 
taken 
into 
account 
as 
a 
form 
of 
program 
support. 
Program support 
provides 
the 
flexibility 
to 
fully 
integrate recurrent 
and 
development 
spending 
under 
the 
MTEF, 
and 
it 
will 
be 
important 
that 
adequate 
capacity 
is 
developed 
to 
ensure 
proper 
allocation 
of 
both 
tax 
and 
program 
aid 
resources 
between development 
and 
recurrent 
expenditures. 
17. 
The overall 
resource envelope 
for 
supporting 
poverty reduction 
in 
Tanzania 
is 
still 
far 
short 
of 
the 
requirements 
for 
achieving 
the 
MDGs. 
This 
notwithstanding, 
there 
are three 
important 
caveats 
emerging 
from 
the 
rising 
trend 
of 
higher 
dependence 
on 
ODA 
and 
the 
shift 
in 
composition 
of 
aid 
toward program 
support. 
First, 
funds 
from 
program 
support 
are 
fully 
fungible 
to 
funds 
from 
domestic 
revenue.  Because increased 
program 
support 
lessens 
the 
pressure 
to 
increase 
domestic 
revenue, 
appropriate  incentives  should 
be 
put 
in 
place 
to 
ensure 
that 
an 
equitable 
and 
growth-supporting 
tax 
system 
is 
in 
place, 
which 
in 
the 
medium 
to 
long 
term 
will 
have 
the 
capacity 
to 
generate 
sufficient 
funds 
to 
lessen 
the 
dependence 
on 
program 
support. 
Second, 
in 
the 
past, 
program 
support 
typically 
showed  a 
higher 
degree 
of 
variability 
and 
unpredictability 
than 
domestic revenue. 
Given 
the 
high 
cost 
that 
resource 
variability 
imposes 
on 
economic 
management, 
it 
will 
be 
important 
to 
develop 
aid 
mechanisms 
that 
allow 
for 
stable 
and 
predictable 
aid 
disbursements 
and 
prevent 
sudden 
changes 
in 
the 
volume 
of 
aid. 
Third, 
to 
the 
extent  that  budget 
support  finances  a  greater 
share 
of 
nontradables 
(eg, 
teacher 
salaries,

support, a 
shift 
toward 
program 
support leads 
to 
upward 
pressure (appreciation) 
of 
the 
exchange rate, 
with 
potential 
implications 
for 
Tanzania's 
international 
competitiveness. 
Reduction 
in 
Poverty 
18. 
With 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
National 
Poverty Eradication 
Strategy (NPES) 
and, 
in 
particular, 
the 
PRS, 
poverty 
reduction 
has 
become 
the 
overarching 
objective 
of 
public 
policy, 
actions, 
and 
M&E. 
19. 
A 
comprehensive 
HBS 
was 
carried out 
in 
fiscal 
2001 and 
the 
results 
were 
released 
in 
April 
2002. Other 
baseline data 
for 
monitoring 
poverty 
are 
provided 
by 
the 
Tanzania 
Reproductive 
and 
Child 
Health 
Survey 
(1999) 
and 
a 
labor force survey 
(2000/01).  Results 
of 
the 
surveys 
reflect 
the 
positive 
economic 
developments, 
particularly 
in 
the 
second 
half 
of 
the 
1990s. 
Although 
Tanzania 
experienced economic 
difficulties 
and 
worsening 
poverty 
in 
the early 
1990s, 
the 
benefits 
of 
the 
more 
recent 
growth 
have 
begun 
to 
reverse 
that 
trend. 
Food 
poverty 
has 
declined 
from 
21.6 
percent 
to 
18.7 
percent, and 
basic 
needs 
poverty 
decreased 
from 
38.6 percent 
to 
35.7 
percent. 
20. 
The 
decline 
in 
income poverty 
is 
corroborated 
by 
improvements 
in 
other dimensions 
of 
poverty 
covered 
by 
the 
survey. 
Most 
notably, 
improvements have 
been 
registered 
in 
the 
quality 
of 
and 
access 
to 
drinking 
water 
in 
rural 
areas, 
a 
relatively 
sharp 
rise 
in 
the 
use 
of 
modern 
construction 
materials 
for 
housing 
(urban and rural), 
and 
increased 
access 
to 
electricity, 
markets, 
and 
public 
transport.  There 
has 
also 
been 
a 
rise 
in 
asset 
holding, 
mostly 
consumer  durables.

The 
government 
has 
set 
up 
an 
institutional 
framework 
for 
poverty monitoring, 
based 
on 
the 
recently 
prepared 
poverty 
monitoring 
master 
plan. 
The 
government 
is 
also 
considering the most 
effective 
way 
to 
integrate the 
MDGs 
into 
an 
updated 
PRS and 
poverty 
monitoring 
systems. 
Such 
integration 
will 
take 
the current 
poverty 
status 
as 
the 
baseline and 
calibrate 
the 
goals 
consistent 
with 
implementation 
capacity. 
22. 
Tanzania 
continues 
to 
focus 
on 
growth 
and 
antipoverty 
measures 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
its 
poverty 
reduction 
strategy 
through 
a 
variety 
of 
sectoral 
and 
cross-sectoral programs, 
as 
well 
as 
through 
the 
national 
budget 
supported 
by 
a 
participatory 
PER-MTEF 
process. 
The 
expenditure 
plan 
in 
the budget 
is 
closely 
aligned 
with 
the 
core 
PRS 
programs: 
education, health, water, 
rural 
roads, 
agriculture, 
and governance. 
Tanzania protects 
budgeted spending 
in 
PRS 
priority 
areas 
from 
cuts 
during 
budget 
execution. 
In 
fiscal 
2002, 
all priority 
spending 
programs and 
locally 
financed 
development 
spending 
were 
executed 
as 
budgeted. 
The 
budget 
for 
fiscal 
2003 
reflects 
Tanzania’s 
continued 
focus 
on 
implementing 
the 
PRS. 
B. 
Progress 
in 
Structural 
and 
Social 
Reforms 
23. 
Starting 
in 
the late 
1980s (and 
pursued 
with 
renewed 
vigor 
since 
the 
mid-l990s), 
Tanzania 
has 
implemented 
a 
broad 
structural  and 
social 
reform 
agenda. 
After 
the 
initial 
objectives 
of 
macrostabilization 
and 
removal 
of 
key 
distortions 
in 
the 
economy had 
been 
attained, 
reforms 
have 
more recently 
focused 
on improving 
economic 
governance, 
providing 
an 
enabling environment 
for 
private 
sector 
activities, and enhancing 
public 
service 
delivery 
for 
poverty 
reduction. 
Economic 
Governance 
24. 
Tanzania 
has 
initiated 
comprehensive 
reforms 
to 
improve 
economic 
governance. 
Reforms 
in 
the 
area 
of 
public 
financial 
management 
include 
the 
implementation 
of 
an 
IFMS, 
the 
adoption 
of 
an 
inclusive 
PER-MTEF 
process, 
and 
the 
revision 
of 
the 
public 
finance management 
and 
the 
public 
procurement 
acts. 
The 
first 
phase 
of 
civil 
service 
reform, 
downsizing 
the 
civil 
service 
and 
bringing 
the 
wage 
bill 
under 
control, 
has 
been 
completed. 
Reforms 
are 
now 
in 
their 
second 
phase 
8 
Page  19
and 
will 
increasingly 
focus 
on 
public 
sector 
performance. 
A 
local 
government 
reform 
program 
aims 
at 
strengthening 
capacities 
of 
the 
local 
authorities, 
which 
bear 
the 
primary 
responsibility 
for 
basic service 
delivery, 
such 
as 
basic 
education, 
primary 
health, water, 
and 
rural 
roads, 
in 
priority 
sectors 
under 
the 
PRS. 
Following 
up 
on 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
Warioba 
report, 
which 
documented deeply 
entrenched 
corruption 
in 
the 
public 
sector, 
a 
national action 
plan for 
the 
control 
of 
corruption 
and 
sector-specific 
anticorruption 
plans 
are 
being 
implemented. 
The 
government 
has 
set 
up 
a 
good 
governance 
coordination 
unit 
in 
the 
chief 
secretary’s 
office 
and 
has 
agreed 
to 
implement 
a 
legal 
sector 
reform 
program. 
Progress 
in 
reducing 
corruption 
is 
partly 
mirrored 
by 
the 
improvement 
in 
Tanzania’s 
relative 
position 
on 
the 
Transparency 
International 
corruption 
perception 
index, 
from 
the 
9 
1st 
position 
in 
2000 
to 
7 1 
st 
position 
(out 
of 
106 countries) 
in 
2002. 
25. 
The 
government, 
working 
with 
development 
partners, 
is 
in 
the 
process 
of 
finalizing 
a 
framework 
for  monitoring 
progress 
in 
improving 
governance. 
The 
framework 
maps 
priority 
actions 
to 
be 
taken 
to 
achieve goals 
set 
out 
in 
the 
PRS 
and 
identifies indicators 
for monitoring 
implementation 
and 
results. 
The 
framework 
cuts 
across 
the 
key 
areas 
of 
action 
and 
seeks 
greater 
coherence 
across 
them. 
An 
Enabling 
Environment 
for 
Private 
Sector 
Activities 
26. 
The 
government 
has 
shown 
a 
strong 
commitment 
to 
withdraw 
from 
commercial activities 
and 
define 
its 
role 
as 
an enabler 
of 
private 
sector 
activities. 
Key 
achievements 
in 
this 
area 
include 
the 
privatization  or  liquidation 
of 
more  than 
80 
percent 
of 
parastatals. 
This 
includes  the 
privatization 
of 
the 
fixed-net 
telephone 
operation 
with 
a 
parallel 
liberalization 
of 
the 
wireless 
telephone  market, 
which 
resulted 
in 
a 
rapid 
increase 
in 
the 
number 
of 
subscribers. 
Similarly, 
government 
has 
disinvested 
its 
interests 
in 
and 
liberalized 
the 
banking 
sector, 
which 
has 
experienced 
a sharp increase 
in 
the 
number 
of 
private 
sector 
banks-with 
23 
now 
operating 
in 
the 
country. 
Recent 
privatizations include 
Air 
Tanzania, Tanga 
Cement, 
and 
private 
operation 
of 
the 
container 
terminal. 
27. 
With 
a 
large 
number 
of 
state-owned 
enterprises 
in 
the 
manufacturing 
sector 
having 
been 
divested 
or 
liquidated, 
the 
focus 
of 
the 
privatization 
program 
has 
now 
moved 
to 
the 
restructuring 
and 
divestiture 
of 
large 
utilities, 
especially 
power, 
water, 
and 
key 
transport 
services, 
and the 
development 
of 
an 
appropriate 
regulatory framework 
to 
govern the operation 
of 
these 
liberalized 
sectors 
in 
a 
competitive 
environment. 
The 
target 
of 
this 
program 
is, 
among other 
things, 
to 
reduce 
the 
cost 
of 
doing 
business 
in 
the 
country  through 
the 
provision 
of 
affordable 
and 
reliable 
infrastructure 
services. 
28. 
A 
private 
operator 
of 
the 
Dar 
es 
Salaam 
Water 
and 
Sewage 
Authority 
(DAWASA) 
was 
selected 
and  approved 
by 
the  cabinet 
in 
December 
2002. 
The 
process 
of 
selecting 
a 
private 
operator 
for 
the  Tanzania 
Railways 
Corporation 
is 
at 
an 
advanced 
stage. 
The 
process 
of 
unbundling 
the Tanzania 
Electricity 
Supply 
Company 
(TANESCO) 
into 
autonomous 
commercial 
entities 
was 
begun 
in 
September 
2001. 
Legislation 
was 
passed 
in 
April 
2001 
to 
establish the 
Surface 
and 
Marine 
Transport 
Regulatory 
Authority 
(SUMATRA) 
and the 
Energy 
and 
Water 
Utilities 
Regulatory 
Authority 
(EWURA). 
Responsibility 
for 
regulation 
of 
safety and 
quality 
of 
petroleum 
products, 
railways,  and 
ports, 
and 
the 
location 
of 
telecommunication,  aviation,  and 
broadcasting 
into 
the 
new 
multisector  regulatory 
framework, 
remain 
to 
be 
decided.  These 
measures 
were 
supported 
by 
PSACl 
and 
benefited 
from 
IDA’S 
technical 
assistance 
under the 
Privatization 
and 
Private 
Sector 
Development 
Project.

Page  20
29. 
A 
key 
government 
strategy 
is 
to 
improve 
the 
investment 
climate 
to 
stimulate 
more 
rapid 
expansion 
of 
local 
and 
foreign private 
investment. 
A 
notable 
success 
in 
this 
area 
was 
the 
setup 
of 
a 
policy 
framework 
for 
the 
mining 
sector 
in 
the 
mid-l990s, 
which 
has 
since experienced 
two- 
digit 
growth 
rates. 
Other 
important 
measures 
include 
the 
revision 
of 
legislation, 
including 
the 
company law, 
and 
the 
liberalization 
of 
capital 
markets. 
The 
Tanzania 
Investment 
Center 
has 
been 
restructured 
and 
competitively 
restaffed 
to 
transform 
it 
into 
an 
effective 
service 
center 
for 
investors. 
To 
enable 
easier 
access 
to 
credit 
and 
the 
use 
of 
land 
as 
collateral, 
land 
regulations 
were 
issued 
and 
gazetted 
in 
May 
2001, 
bringing 
the 
1999 
Land 
Act 
Number 
4 
and 
the 
Village 
Land 
Act 
Number 
5 
into 
effect. 
The 
government 
is 
now 
in 
the 
process 
of 
further 
reviewing 
the 
new 
land laws 
to 
address 
residual 
concerns 
of 
investors  and 
financial 
intermediaries,  and 
it 
is 
also 
considering 
measures 
for 
more effective application 
of 
the 
new 
laws. 
The 
opening 
up 
of 
the 
Dar 
es 
Salaam 
stock 
exchange 
to 
foreign 
investors 
has 
been 
approved 
and 
is 
expected 
to 
become 
effective 
in 
2003. 
30. 
In 
April 
2002, 
the government 
and 
the 
private 
sector 
launched 
a 
framework 
for 
public- 
private 
sector 
partnership 
under 
the 
Tanzania 
National 
Business 
Council 
(TNBC). 
The 
council 
is 
chaired 
by 
the 
president, and 
the 
chair 
of 
the 
Private 
Sector 
Foundation 
serves 
as 
the 
council’s 
vice 
chairman. 
Within 
this 
framework, 
the 
council 
has 
organized 
two 
investor 
roundtables 
for 
local 
and 
international 
investors. 
The International Investor 
Roundtable 
(IRT), 
made 
up 
of 
global 
corporate 
executives 
(mostly 
CEOs), 
advises 
the 
president 
on 
improvement 
of 
the 
investment 
climate 
in 
Tanzania. 
A 
mechanism 
has 
been 
put 
in 
place 
to monitor 
implementation 
of 
follow-up 
actions 
drawn 
from 
advice 
given 
during 
the 
roundtable 
meetings. 
The 
roundtable 
provides 
peer 
pressure 
for 
speeding 
up 
implementation 
of 
agreed 
reforms 
in 
addition 
to 
sharing 
international 
experience 
in 
addressing constraints 
to 
private 
investment. 
The 
World 
Bank 
provides support 
to 
both 
the 
IRT 
and the 
TNBC. 
Improved 
Delivery 
of 
Public 
Services 
31. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
overall 
measures 
to 
improve 
economic 
governance, 
public 
service 
delivery 
is 
being 
enhanced 
by 
establishing and 
aligning 
sector 
development 
programs 
with 
the 
PRS 
for 
such 
key 
sectors 
such 
as 
health, education, 
agriculture, 
and roads 
and according 
them 
priority 
budget 
formulation 
and implementation. 
32. 
Education: 
Progress 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Education 
Sector 
Development Program 
(ESDP) 
includes 
increased 
budgetary  allocations 
to 
education, 
especially 
primary 
education, 
abolition 
of 
school 
fees 
in 
2001, establishment 
of 
the 
Education 
Fund 
to 
support 
children 
from 
very 
poor 
families, 
and, 
starting 
in 
school year 
2002, 
the 
introduction 
of 
a 
capitation  grant 
of 
US$10 
per 
pupil 
to 
cover 
expenditures 
on 
textbooks, 
other  teaching 
and 
learning 
materials, 
school 
operation 
and administration, 
and cluster-based teacher 
professional 
development. 
The 
commencement 
of 
the 
Primary 
Education Development Program 
in 
fiscal 
200 
1/02 
has 
had 
a 
particularly 
significant impact 
on 
reversing 
the 
decline 
in 
school enrollment. 
The 
second PRS 
progress 
report 
shows 
that 
the 
gross 
enrollment 
ratio 
(GER) 
reached 
100 
percent 
in 
2002, 
up 
from 
78  percent 
in 
1990 
and  surpassing the  PRS 
target 
of 
85 
percent. 
Net 
enrollment 
in 
primary 
education 
rose 
from 
65 
percent 
in 
2000 
to 
85 
percent 
in 
2002, 
also surpassing 
the 
PRS 
medium- 
term 
target 
of 
70 
percent. Results 
from 
the 
2000/01 
HBS 
indicate 
that 
primary 
school 
enrollment 
of 
girls 
now 
exceeds 
that 
of 
boys. 
Apart 
from 
the 
response 
to 
abolishing 
school 
fees, 
this 
achievement  has  been  enabled 
by 
a  concerted 
enrollment 
drive 
supported 
by 
all 
levels 
of 
government 
and  communities, 
including 
construction 
of 
new 
classrooms, 
recruitment 
of 
additional 
teachers, 
and improvement 
in 
nutrition 
in 
school programs. 
However, disparities 
across 
regions  and 
districts 
are 
wide, 
with 
the 
poorest 
registering 
a 
GER 
of 
about 
80 
percent. 
The 
challenge 
of 
improving 
the 
quality 
of 
primary 
education-which 
is 
needed 
to 
reduce 
the 
10 
Page  21
relatively 
high 
illiteracy 
rate 
of 
about 
25 
percent-is 
still 
daunting. 
There 
is 
also 
large 
group 
of 
children 
whose 
right 
to 
education 
is 
at 
risk 
because 
they 
are 
“overageyy 
and 
cannot 
presently 
be 
accommodated 
in 
primary 
schools. 
33. 
The 
pass 
rate 
of 
those 
completing 
primary 
school education 
has 
increased 
from 
20 
percent 
in 
2000 
to 
29 
percent 
in 
2001/02, 
still 
far 
short 
of 
the 
medium-term 
target 
of 
50 
percent. 
The 
transition 
rate 
from 
primary 
education 
to 
secondary 
education 
has 
increased 
from 
19.5 
percent 
in 
2000 
to 
21.7 
percent 
in 
2001, 
exceeding 
slightly 
the 
PRS 
target 
set 
for 
2003. 
This 
rise 
has been 
aided 
partly 
by 
opening 
new, 
government-aided, 
community 
secondary schools.

HSDP, 
PRS targets 
will 
be 
mainstreamed 
into 
the 
next 
phase 
to 
begin 
in 
2003/04. 
The 
health 
sector 
reforms 
are 
being 
synchronized 
with 
the 
local 
government  reforms. 
A 
coordination 
desk 
has also been established 
to 
promote 
private 
sector 
participation 
in 
health 
service

Television 
and 
radio

being 
used 
for 
advocacy 
of 
the  health

The  national  malaria medium-term

Although 
the 
overall 
results 
from 
the 
HSDP 
have 
been 
less 
spectacular 
than  those 
in 
education, there 
are 
some areas 
of 
success 
to 
note. 
One 
of 
the 
key 
achievements 
of 
the 
HDSP 
is 
improved 
funding 
for 
and 
availability 
of 
drugs 
and 
medical 
supplies 
in 
primary 
health 
service 
units. 
Health 
spending 
has 
begun 
to 
be 
driven 
by 
the 
health 
sector 
reform, and 
spending 
on 
both 
preventive 
and 
district 
services 
has 
increased. 
Public 
spending 
on 
health 
has 
increased 
from

C. 
Emerging 
Issues 
and Challenges 
for 
the 
Medium 
Term 
3 
7. 
Notwithstanding 
the 
progress 
discussed  earlier, 
poverty 
in 
Tanzania 
remains 
at 
unacceptably 
high 
levels 
and 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
pandemic 
poses 
a 
major 
threat 
to 
the 
achievements 
made 
on 
all 
fronts. 
More 
than 
35 
percent 
of 
Tanzanians cannot 
afford 
basic 
needs, 
and 
nearly 
18 
percent cannot 
afford 
the 
food 
required 
for 
healthy 
living. 
Despite 
improvements, 
53 
percent 
of 
rural 
Tanzanians 
still 
do 
not 
have 
access 
to 
protected 
water, 
and 
more than 
50 percent 
of 
them 
have 
to 
fetch 
water 
from 
sources 
more 
than 
a 
kilometer 
away. 
Ninety 
percent 
of 
Tanzanians 
do 
not 
have 
access 
to 
electricity 
or 
gas, 
and 
one-fourth 
of 
the 
population 
still 
has 
to 
travel more than 
six 
kilometers 
to 
a 
health 
center 
or 
dispensary. 
Although 
there 
have 
been 
sharp 
improvements 
in 
the 
last 
decade, 
the 
majority 
of 
Tanzanians 
still 
use 
nondurable materials 
to 
construct 
houses. 
38. 
HIV 
infection 
rates 
continue 
to 
rise, 
and, 
according 
to 
the 
latest 
estimates, 
about 
12 
percent 
of 
Tanzania’s 
adult 
population 
is 
HIV 
positive. 
The 
infection 
rate 
is 
highest among 
young 
adults 
aged 
19 
to 
25, 
which 
will 
have 
dire 
consequences 
for 
the 
productive labor 
force  and 
hence 
growth. 
Estimates indicate that 
Tanzania’s 
GDP could 
be 
15-20 
percent 
lower 
by 
20 
15 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
pandemic. 
The 
burden 
on both 
public 
and 
private 
resources 
for 
care 
of 
patients 
and 
orphans 
is 
large  and 
diverts 
scarce 
resources 
from 
support 
of 
economic 
progress  and 
improved 
livelihoods. 
Pockets 
of 
success 
in 
containing 
HIV/AIDS 
have 
occurred 
in 
Tanzania 
where 
community-based programs were 
implemented, 
But 
these 
programs 
should 
be 
scaled 
up. 
A 
key 
lesson 
from 
these experiences 
is 
that 
when 
communities 
are 
involved 
and 
interested, 
success 
is 
more 
likely. 
Government 
support  can become 
more 
cost-effective  and 
sustainable 
through 
energizing 
community 
efforts.

As 
Tanzania 
prepares 
to 
face 
these 
daunting 
challenges 
under 
the 
auspices 
of 
the 
PRS, 
the 
issues 
identified 
in 
the 
PRS 
remain very 
much 
in 
focus and 
prompt 
continued 
effort 
to 
address 
them 
to 
make durable 
progress 
in 
poverty 
reduction. 
These 
issues 
go 
beyond 
the 
earnest 
effort 
now 
under 
way 
to 
improve 
social 
well-being 
by 
focusing 
on 
social 
sectors. 
Drawing from 
analytic 
work 
and a 
broad 
range 
of 
discussions 
with 
the 
government and other 
stakeholders, 
the 
main 
concerns 
raised relate 
to 
the 
following 
six 
areas: 
Increasing 
durable 
growth 
and  spreading 
its 
impact 
is 
a 
central 
concern 
and 
has 
become 
a 
test 
of 
whether 
the 
reforms 
have 
been 
worthwhile. 
Private 
sector 
development 
(PSD) 
has 
been 
identified 
as 
the 
leader 
of 
growth. 
The 
public 
sector 
can 
play 
a 
pivotal 
role 
in 
scaling 
up 
growth 
through predictably 
providing 
an 
enabling 
policy 
and 
institutional 
environment 
for 
the 
development 
of 
private 
initiative, 
more 
broadly, 
and 
private 
investment, 
in 
particular. 
In 
combination 
with 
ongoing efforts 
to 
enhance 
human 
capabilities 
for 
production 
and enterprise, 
and 
measures 
to 
lower 
the 
cost 
of 
doing 
business 
(infrastructure 
services 
and 
property 
rights), 
a robust 
private 
sector 
investment 
response 
in 
large-, 
medium-, 
and 
small-scale 
enterprises 
is 
key 
to 
expanding 
productive 
capacity 
and 
the 
ability 
of 
the 
economy 
to gainfully 
engage 
its 
competencies. Therefore, 
improving 
the investment 
climate 
is 
essential 
to 
success. 
The 
majority 
of 
the 
poor 
in 
Tanzania depend 
on 
agriculture, 
small-scale 
enterprise, 
and the 
informal 
sector 
for 
their 
livelihood. 
These sectors 
have also 
increasingly 
been 
providing 
work for 
both 
the 
rapidly 
expanding 
population 
of 
young 
Tanzanians 
and 
women. 
Implementation 
of 
the 
rural 
development 
strategy 
and, 
within 
it, 
the 
Agriculture 
Sector 
Development 
Program 
(ASDP), 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
and 
promotion 
of 
investment 
in 
small 
and 
medium 
enterprises 
(SMEs) 
and 
informal 
sector 
activities, 
on 
the 
other, 
will 
help 
to 
combat 
both 
rural 
and 
urban poverty. 
In 
both 
respects, 
the 
public 
sector’s 
primary role 
is 
to 
enable 
private 
initiative 
and 
reduce 
the 
cost 
of 
such 
initiative 
through 
well-targeted policies, 
facilitating 
access 
to 
finance 
and 
knowledge, 
and 
promoting 
the 
emergence 
of 
an 
institutional 
framework that 
protects 
property 
rights 
and 
reduces 
the 
cost and 
risk 
of 
doing 
business. 
In 
the 
rapidly 
globalizing 
economy, 
improved 
competitiveness 
of 
Tanzanian 
enterprise 
is 
key 
to 
exploiting 
larger 
world 
markets  and 
pursuing 
a 
risk-reducing 
diversification 
of 
the 
Tanzanian economy. Measures 
to 
reduce 
impediments 
to 
export 
and 
favoring 
a 
diversified 
export 
orientation 
are 
fundamental 
for 
success. 
Although 
substantial 
progress 
has 
been 
made 
in 
reducing direct 
export 
controls, 
there 
is 
need 
to 
further 
reduce 
nontariff 
and domestic trade 
barriers 
and 
improve 
export 
competencies 
and 
access 
to 
information 
on 
market 
opportunities. 
FDI 
aids  such 
access 
and 
contributes 
to 
productivity 
growth. 
The 
Foreign 
Investment 
Advisory 
Service 
(FIAS) 
recently carried 
out 
an 
assessment 
and 
identified 
priority 
measures 
for 
enhancing 
competitiveness 
in 
Tanzania. 
A 
Bank 
study 
on 
rural 
development 
has 
identified 
the 
key 
impediments 
to 
agriculture exports 
in 
which 
Tanzania should 
have 
comparative 
advantage  and 
measures 
to 
remove 
those 
impediments. 
The 
study 
also 
identifies 
some 
of 
the 
key 
issues 
to 
be 
addressed 
for 
effective implementation 
of 
the 
recently 
completed 
rural 
development 
strategy. 
With 
support 
mainly 
from 
the 
U.K. 
Department 
for 
International Development 
(DFID), 
the 
Tanzanian government 
has 
identified 
strategic 
policy, 
institutional, 
and 
technical 
assistance 
needs 
for improving 
the 
business 
environment 
in 
Tanzania 
under 
the 
BEST 
program. 
In 
combination 
with 
the 
assessment 
of 
the 
main 
constraints 
faced 
by 
SMEs 
and 
the 
required 
actions 
for 
dealing 
with 
them, 
a 
set 
of 
updated 
priority 
measures 
has 
been 
identified. 
In 
addition, 
both 
the 
local 
and 
the 
international 
investor roundtables 
held 
in 
2002 
identified 
the 
Page  24
key 
impediments 
to 
private 
sector 
growth 
in 
Tanzania. 
The 
most important among 
these 
include 
security 
of 
property, 
transparency  and 
predictability 
of 
the 
business 
environment  (particularly 
in 
agriculture), 
cost 
of 
infrastructure 
services, 
and 
availability 
of 
skilled 
staff. 
(d) 
Vulnerability 
to 
risks 
in 
earnings, 
particularly 
for 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
poor 
who 
are 
dependent 
on primary 
agricultural 
export 
products, 
is 
another 
emerging 
concern. 
Arguments 
in 
favor 
of 
price 
support, controls,  and 
subsidy 
programs 
are 
reemerging 
as 
steep 
price  fluctuations 
for 
key 
primary 
exports 
expose 
poor 
smallholders 
to 
income  vulnerability. 
Promarket 
responses-for 
example, 
use 
of 
hedging 
where 
products’ 
forward 
markets 
are 
available 
or 
markets 
for 
risk 
insurance-need 
to 
be 
quickly 
developed. Otherwise, 
pressure 
will 
intensify 
for 
the 
reversal 
of 
marketing 
reforms 
that 
have 
been 
painfully 
undertaken over 
the 
last 
15 
years. 
(e) 
Although 
progress 
has 
been 
made 
in 
reorienting 
the 
allocation 
of 
public 
resources 
(own 
and 
from 
external 
sources) 
toward 
the 
priority 
sectors, 
which 
are 
predominantly 
social 
sectors, 
attention should 
now 
increasingly 
turn 
toward 
improving 
efficiency 
in 
their 
application,  increasing 
efficacy 
in 
converting 
these 
resources 
and 
efforts 
into 
desired 
services, 
and 
raising 
the 
impact 
of 
improved 
service 
delivery 
on 
the 
livelihoods 
of 
Tanzanians. 
This 
in 
turn 
provides 
a 
enduring 
motivation to 
sustain the 
reform 
effort 
and 
improvement 
in 
public 
service 
delivery. 
To 
that 
end, 
critical 
measures 
include 
those 
that target 
improved 
public 
financial 
management, 
contain 
leakages 
in 
the 
flow 
of 
resources 
through  various  levels 
of 
government 
to 
service 
delivery 
units, 
strengthen 
accountability 
for 
means 
and 
results 
of 
poverty 
reduction 
measures, 
and 
monitor 
and 
incentivize 
public 
service 
both 
professionally 
and 
financially. 
These 
fall 
under 
the 
rubric 
of 
economic 
governance. 
As 
the 
next 
round 
of 
elections 
approaches, 
concerns  about 
the 
durability 
of 
commitment 
to 
reforms 
will 
mount. 
To 
ensure 
the 
sustainability 
of 
reform 
achievements 
of 
the 
current 
government, 
legal 
and 
institutional 
changes 
are 
necessary 
to 
root 
these 
reforms 
deeply 
in 
both 
attitude 
and  practice. 
The 
Accountability, 
Transparency,  and 
Integrity 
Project 
(ATIP) 
is 
preparing 
a 
program 
to 
support 
Tanzania’s 
efforts 
to 
consolidate 
the 
institutional 
and 
legal framework. 
Assuring 
investors 
that 
the 
changes 
made 
are 
durable 
is 
a 
major 
challenge 
in 
scaling 
up 
investor 
response.

THE 
TANZANIA 
PRS 
FRAMEWORK 
40. 
Tanzania launched the 
participatory 
PRS 
process 
in 
1999 
with 
the 
preparation 
of 
an 
interim 
PRS, 
followed 
by 
the 
approval 
of 
a 
full 
PRS 
in 
2000 
and the  presentation 
of 
the 
first 
PRS 
progress 
report 
in 
2001. 
Endorsement 
by 
the 
Bank 
and 
IMF 
Boards 
of 
the 
PRS 
and 
the 
first 
progress 
report 
enabled 
Tanzania 
to 
gain 
access 
to 
irrevocable 
debt 
relief 
by 
reaching 
the 
completion

Poverty reduction 
has 
been 
a 
policy 
objective 
in 
Tanzania 
for 
four 
decades, 
but 
the 
growth 
strategy 
relied 
on 
excessive 
state 
interventions, 
and 
government  programs 
were 
typically 
underfunded  and 
poorly 
prioritized. 
The 
PRS 
represents 
a 
significant 
departure 
from 
past 
approaches 
to 
poverty 
reduction 
in 
several 
respects. 
42. 
Policies 
for 
sustained 
economic 
growth 
are 
now 
assigned 
high 
priority, 
and the importance 
of 
maintaining 
macroeconomic 
stability 
is 
fully 
acknowledged. 
Moreover, 
the 
PRS 
lays 
out 
the 
remaining 
medium-term structural 
challenges 
and 
discusses measures 
and expenditure programs 
to 
address 
them 
in 
the 
framework 
of 
a 
prioritized 
medium-term 
action plan. 
The 
strategy 
has 
evolved through 
a broad-based 
participatory 
process. 
Listening 
to 
the 
poor, 
to 
civil 
society, 
nongovernmental  organizations 
(NGOs), 
and  various 
other 
stakeholders 
has 
enabled 
the 
government 
to 
recognize 
and 
address 
the 
multidimensional 
aspects 
of 
poverty. 
Given 
the fragmentary  statistical 
data 
on 
poverty, 
the 
need 
for 
further 
work 
on 
reform 
strategies 
in 
some 
key 
areas, 
and 
the 
uncertainty about 
future 
financing 
resources, 
the 
current  PRS 
is 
a 
work 
in 
progress 
that 
will 
be 
refined 
as 
new 
information 
becomes 
available. Tanzania 
has adopted a 
rolling 
approach 
to 
updating the 
PRS 
and 
its 
action 
plan, 
learning 
from 
implementation 
experience. 
0 
The 
PRS 
has 
also  become  an 
important 
instrument 
for 
coordination 
within 
the 
government 
to 
ensure 
coherence 
of 
the various 
sectoral and cross-sectoral 
reform 
efforts 
in 
support 
of 
poverty 
reduction. 
The 
Interministerial  Technical  Committee 
(IMTC), 
which 
is 
chaired 
by 
the 
chief 
secretary 
meets 
quarterly 
to 
review 
progress 
on 
the various 
reform 
efforts, 
and 
the 
president 
chairs 
the 
annual 
review 
of 
progress 
in 
implementing 
the 
action 
plans undertaken 
by 
government 
departments, 
regions, and 
districts. 
Finally, 
the 
PRS 
correctly 
recognizes 
that 
the 
struggle against 
poverty 
will 
require 
better 
donor 
coordination, 
improved 
integration 
of 
external 
assistance 
into 
the 
budget, 
and 
simplification 
of 
aid 
disbursement 
procedures. 
Implementation 
of 
the 
Tanzania 
Assistance Strategy 
(TAS)’ 
aimed 
at addressing 
these 
concerns 
is 
being 
monitored 
by 
the 
Independent 
Monitoring 
Group 
(IMG), 
whose 
report 
feeds 
into inclusive 
deliberations 
for 
further 
improvement.

The 
TAS 
is 
a 
government 
initiative 
aimed 
at 
restoring local 
leadership 
and 
ownership 
of 
Tanzania’s development 
agenda. 
It 
provides 
a 
coherent 
national 
development 
framework 
for 
managing external 
resources 
to 
achieve 
the 
development 
strategies 
as 
stated 
in 
the 
Vision 
2025, 
the 
NPES, 
and 
the 
PRSP.

43. 
The 
PRS 
focuses 
on 
three 
main 
areas 
of 
outcomes and actions 
for 
realizing 
them. 
The 
first 
is 
reduction 
in 
the 
breadth and 
depth 
of 
income 
poverty. 
The 
outcome 
targets 
include reduction 
of 
basic needs 
poverty 
and 
food 
poverty, 
with 
a 
particular 
focus 
on 
rural 
areas, 
where 
poverty 
is 
most 
prevalent. 
The 
second 
area 
is 
that 
of 
improving 
the 
quality 
of 
life 
and social 
well-being. 
This 
entails 
improved 
human 
capabilities,  enhanced 
longevity 
and 
survival,  social 
inclusion 
and 
personal 
security, 
improved 
nutrition, 
and 
containment 
of 
extreme 
vulnerability 
(mainly 
through 
social 
safety 
nets). 
The 
third 
broad 
area 
concerns  sustaining an 
environment that 
is 
conducive 
to 
development, 
which 
encompasses 
macroeconomic 
stability 
and 
good 
governance. 
44. 
The 
first 
and 
third 
areas 
entail 
cross-sectoral and 
institutional 
measures, 
and 
the 
second 
is 
primarily 
dealt 
with 
through 
sector-specific 
interventions 
in 
areas 
such 
as 
health, education, 
and 
water, 
which 
are designated 
as 
priority 
sectors. 
As 
part 
of 
the 
PRS 
process, 
the 
government 
has 
prepared,  realigned, 
and  approved 
sector 
development 
programs 
for 
health,  basic  education, 
agriculture,  and 
water. 
These 
now 
provide 
the 
framework 
for 
supporting 
the 
implementation 
of 
the PRS 
targets 
that 
are 
specific 
to 
the 
sectors. 
45. 
The 
PRS 
is 
explicit 
with 
regard 
to 
targets 
for 
resource 
allocation 
to 
priority 
sectors, 
which 
are 
defined 
as 
(a) 
education (notably 
at 
the 
primary 
school 
level); 
(b) 
health (primary health 
care); 
(c) 
agriculture 
(research and extension); 
(d) 
roads 
in 
rural 
areas; 
(e) 
water; 
(0 
the 
justice 
system; 
(g) 
improved 
governance, 
including 
combating 
corruption; 
and 
(h) 
HIV/AIDS. 
The 
government 
intends 
to 
focus 
poverty 
reduction 
resource 
allocation on 
these 
priority 
areas 
and 
has 
made a 
deliberate 
decision 
to 
increase 
allocations 
for 
operations 
and 
maintenance expenditures, 
as 
well 
as 
remuneration 
to 
motivate 
personnel 
toward 
greater 
efficiency 
in 
the 
delivery 
of 
these 
services. 
These 
allocations 
are 
based 
on 
estimates 
of 
recurrent 
cost 
requirements  and 
several  sector- 
specific 
studies. 
The 
sector 
priorities 
and 
budget allocations 
need 
to 
be 
sustained over 
time to 
maximize 
the returns 
to 
poverty 
reduction, 
especially 
rural 
poverty 
reduction. 
46. 
Growth 
andpoverty 
reduction outlook: 
The 
PRS 
emphasizes 
that 
growth 
is 
a 
pillar 
of 
sustained 
elimination 
of 
poverty, 
which 
can 
only 
be facilitated 
by 
an 
improved 
environment 
for 
that 
growth. 
Achieving 
targets 
for 
the 
reduction 
of 
income 
poverty 
thus 
requires 
putting 
in 
place 
policies 
and 
institutions 
to 
support the achievement 
of 
higher 
and 
sustained 
growth. 
In 
addition, 
there 
are 
PRS 
targets 
for 
services such 
as 
health 
and education, 
which 
are 
aimed 
at 
improving 
social 
well-being 
and 
enhancing the capacity 
of 
the 
poor 
to 
exploit 
income-earning 
opportunities 
from 
growth. 
47. 
The 
structure 
of 
the 
Tanzanian 
economy 
is 
characterized 
by 
heavy 
reliance 
on 
agriculture, 
which 
contributes 
45 
percent 
of 
GDP 
and 
thus 
provides the 
backbone 
of 
sustained 
economic 
growth 
and 
poverty 
reduction. 
One 
of 
the 
PRSC’s 
areas 
of 
focus 
is 
therefore 
setting 
up 
a 
program 
aimed 
at 
fostering 
rural 
and 
agriculture 
sector 
development. 
The 
ASDP 
presents a comprehensive 
package 
of 
measures 
to 
foster 
sustained 
agricultural 
growth, 
and 
its 
approval 
and 
implementation 
are 
thus 
part 
of 
the performance 
criteria 
of 
the 
PRSC. 
Limited 
access 
to 
agricultural 
credit, 
high 
levels 
of 
agricultural 
taxation, 
insecurity 
with 
respect 
to 
property 
rights 
to 
land 
and 
its 
use 
as 
collateral 
for 
credit, 
as 
well 
as 
limited 
access 
to 
markets 
as 
a 
result 
of 
poor 
transport 
infrastructure,  have 
been 
identified 
as 
key 
constraints 
to 
agriculture 
sector 
growth 
and 
are 
thus 
targeted 
under 
the 
PRSC. 
These 
measures 
are 
expected 
to allow 
the 
agriculture 
sector 
to grow 
on 
a sustained basis 
by 
5 
percent 
annually. 
48. 
Although 
agriculture 
sector 
growth 
is 
critical 
to 
overall 
economic 
growth 
because 
of 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
sector 
to 
GDP, 
achieving 
the 
poverty  reduction 
targets 
will 
also 
require 
accelerated 
growth 
in 
the 
industrial 
and service 
sectors. 
The 
government 
has 
withdrawn 
from 
most economic 
activities, 
and 
the 
private 
sector 
is 
now 
unequivocally 
recognized 
as 
playing 
the 
16 
Page  27
lead 
role 
in 
these  sectors. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
the 
liberalization 
of 
the 
economy 
and  sustained 
macroeconomic  stability, 
these sectors 
have 
grown 
between 
5 
and 6 percent 
annually 
in 
recent 
years. 
However, 
high 
cost 
and 
limited 
availability 
of 
infrastructure 
services, 
human 
resource and 
labor market 
barriers, and 
red 
tape 
in 
the 
public 
sector are 
the 
principal 
constraints 
to 
even 
higher 
growth 
rates 
in 
these 
sectors. 
Although 
infrastructure bottlenecks 
and 
human 
resource 
constraints 
are 
being 
addressed 
through 
accelerated 
development 
of 
the 
transport 
and 
power 
sector, 
the PRSC 
focuses 
on 
further 
improvements 
in 
the 
business 
environment 
and 
PSD, 
with 
particular attention 
to 
SMEs. 
Implementation 
of 
these 
measures, 
which 
are 
leveraged 
by 
the 
PRSC, 
should 
allow 
a 
scaling 
up 
of 
growth 
in 
industry 
to 
between 
8 
and 
10 
percent 
per 
year 
and 
growth 
in 
the 
service 
sector 
between 
6 
and 
8 percent 
per 
year. Sustained 
strong performance 
in 
the 
mining 
sector and 
the 
tourisms 
sector, 
which 
have been 
important 
contributors 
to 
economic 
growth 
in 
recent 
years, 
will 
add 
to 
the 
overall 
positive 
outlook 
for 
sustained 
growth 
performance and 
poverty 
reduction.

Tanzania’s 
growth 
and 
poverty reduction 
targets 
are 
defined 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
PRS, 
which 
encompasses 
the 
MDGs. 
With 
respect 
to 
income poverty, 
the 
target 
is 
to 
halve income 
poverty 
by 
2010, 
that 
is, 
reduce 
income 
poverty 
from 
the current 36 
percent 
to 
18 
percent. 
Using 
estimates 
for 
poverty 
elasticity, 
which 
range 
for 
Tanzania 
between 
0.53 
and 
1.09, 
estimates 
in 
table 
2 
indicate 
annual 
real growth 
rates 
required 
to 
achieve 
various 
poverty reduction 
rates, 
assuming unchanged income 
distribution. 
To 
the 
extent 
that 
patterns 
of 
growth 
favor the 
poor, 
lower growth 
rates also 
could 
lead 
to 
the 
targeted 
poverty 
reduction. 
The 
latest 
CEM, 
published 
in 
2002, 
indicates that achieving 
such 
growth 
rates 
would 
require 
sustained 
improvements 
in 
the 
institutional 
and 
policy 
environment 
as 
well 
as 
significant 
investments 
in 
human 
and 
physical 
capital. 
The 
PRSC 
program 
supports 
these 
improvements.

Halving

by

in 
line 
with 
the 
MDG 
targets 
would 
require 
sustained 
annual 
per

GDP 
growth 
of 
at least 
4.4 
percent. 
Reaching 
the 
target 
already 
by 
201

as- 
indicated 
in 
the 
PRS 
would 
require 
average 
annual 
per 
capita 
GDP 
growth 
of 
6.8 
percent. 
The 
principal 
supporting 
measures 
required 
to 
achieve 
these 
growth 
targets 
are 
(a) 
maintaining 
sound 
macroeconomic 
policies 
and 
intensified implementation 
of 
market 
reforms aimed 
at 
bolstering 
market efficiency, notably 
in 
agriculture; 
(b) 
channeling 
limited 
government 
resources 
toward 
the 
support 
of 
key 
programs and social 
services 
and enhancing 
efficiency 
and 
transparency 
in 
their 
application; 
(c) 
increasing 
emphasis 
on 
reforms aimed 
at 
promoting 
export-oriented  expansion 
and 
diversification 
of 
“pro-poor” 
sectors; 
and 
(d) 
increasing 
investment 
as 
a percentage 
of 
GDP 
from 
15 
percent 
to 
approximately 
17 
percent.

WORLD 
BANK 
GROUP 
STRATEGY 
A. 
Consistency 
of 
the 
PRSC 
with 
the 
Country 
Assistance 
Strategy 
(CAS) 
5 
1. 
The 
proposed 
PRSCl 
is 
premised 
on 
the strong 
record 
Tanzania 
has 
maintained 
during 
the 
past 
five 
years 
in 
successfully 
implementing 
macroeconomic and structural 
reforms 
supported 
by 
the Bank, 
the 
IMF, 
and other 
donors. Successive 
Poverty Reduction 
and 
Growth 
Facility 
(PRGF) 
reviews, 
PERs, 
and supervision missions 
for 
the 
PSAC 
have 
confirmed 
these 
achievements. 
52. 
The 
high 
case 
scenario 
of 
the 
CAS 
for 
fiscal 
2001-03 
envisaged a 
Public 
Expenditure 
Reform 
Credit 
(now 
PRSC) 
to 
support 
Tanzania’s 
efforts 
in 
combating 
poverty, 
spur 
rural 
development,  and 
promote protection 
of 
the 
environment 
as 
a basis 
for 
sustainable 
development. 
It 
was 
planned 
that  the  PRSC 
would 
be 
the 
instrument 
through 
which 
the 
Bank 
would 
systematically 
address 
the 
issues 
of 
poverty 
reduction 
across 
sectors 
that 
were 
identified 
in 
the 
PRS. 
The 
triggers 
for 
moving 
to 
this 
scenario 
were specified 
in 
the 
Tanzania 
fiscal 
2001-03 
CAS 
and 
all 
actions 
under 
the 
triggers 
have 
been 
implemented. 
Aside 
from 
maintaining 
a  stable 
macroeconomic 
environment, 
the 
triggers 
included 
an 
increased 
poverty 
focus 
of 
public 
expenditures; 
the  development 
of 
coherent 
sector 
programs 
for 
health, 
education,  water, 
environment,  and 
agriculture combined 
with 
strengthened 
capacities 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
these 
sector programs; 
and 
a 
variety 
of 
governance 
measures 
to 
fight 
corruption 
and strengthen 
public 
sector 
financial 
management. 
The 
fulfillment 
of 
these 
triggers 
is 
assessed 
in 
annex 
8. 
53. 
A 
new 
CAS 
for 
the 
period 
fiscal 
2004-06 
is 
currently 
under 
preparation 
and 
will 
be 
presented 
to 
the 
Board 
together 
with 
the 
next 
year’s 
PRS  progress 
report. 
To 
support 
the 
implementation 
of 
Tanzania’s 
PRS, 
efforts 
to 
maintain 
macroeconomic 
stability 
will 
continue, 
but 
the 
focus 
is 
increasingly 
shifting 
to 
sector-level 
and 
cross-cutting 
public 
sector management 
issues. 
The 
key 
challenge 
is 
to 
replicate 
the 
excellent macroeconomic 
policy 
and 
implementation 
record 
at 
the 
sector 
level 
to 
facilitate 
economic transformation and 
poverty 
eradication. 
54. 
One 
of 
the 
key 
themes 
of 
the 
new 
CAS 
will 
be 
the 
full 
alignment 
of 
Bank 
instruments 
with 
the 
principles 
of 
local 
ownership 
and leadership 
of 
development 
efforts 
set 
out 
in 
the 
PRS 
and, 
more specifically, 
in 
the 
TAS. 
Because 
government 
policies 
and the government 
budget 
are 
the 
key 
instruments 
in 
implementing 
the 
PRS, 
the 
Bank 
will 
increasingly 
provide 
general 
budget 
support, a 
shift 
that 
has 
already been 
initiated 
under 
the 
current 
CAS. 
Over 
the 
medium 
term, 
the 
PRSC 
will 
become 
the 
main 
instrument 
for 
the 
transfer 
of 
financial 
resources  and 
policy 
dialogue. 
A 
shift 
in 
lending 
modalities 
is 
considered 
necessary, 
because sector 
interventions 
through 
investment projects have been 
characterized 
by 
variable 
local 
ownership 
and 
have 
not 
always 
been 
well 
integrated 
with 
other 
sectoral activities,  and 
thus 
sustainability 
has 
been 
low. 
Also, 
development 
of 
government 
systems 
has 
received 
limited 
support, 
because 
most 
donors 
have tended 
to 
focus 
on 
their 
own 
aid 
delivery 
mechanisms. 
The 
shift 
to 
programmatic 
lending 
was 
precipitated 
by 
the 
government’s 
call for 
a 
change 
in 
donors’ 
lending modalities. The 
shift 
in 
Tanzania 
was 
justified 
on 
three 
grounds: 
(1) 
the 
PRS 
has 
evolved 
into 
the 
overarching framework 
for 
policy 
dialogue 
and 
formulation both 
within 
Tanzania and 
between 
government and the 
donor 
community, 
(2) 
progress 
on 
the 
macroeconomic 
front 
has 
lessened 
the 
need 
for 
traditional 
adjustment  lending, 
and 
(3) 
progress 
in 
planning 
and 
budget 
management 
provides 
confidence 
that 
public 
resource 
allocations 
are 
consistent 
with 
PRS 
priorities. 
55. 
It 
is 
envisaged 
that 
the 
transition 
will 
be 
a gradual one. 
Initial 
PRSC 
support 
will 
coexist 
with 
budget 
and 
investment 
support 
to 
well-articulated 
sector 
programs 
and 
technical 
assistance 
to 
the 
development 
of 
government 
systems 
and capacities necessary 
for 
the 
increased 
reliance 
on 
18 
Page  29
government 
systems 
in 
the 
provision 
of 
external 
support 
and the 
switch 
to 
program 
support. 
This 
approach, 
in 
which 
the 
PRSC 
initially 
covers 
primarily 
cross-cutting 
issues 
and 
policy 
dialogue 
and 
only 
gradually 
embraces 
sectoral 
support, 
provides 
scope 
for 
learning 
on 
both 
the 
Bank 
and 
the 
government 
sides 
and a 
continued evaluation 
of 
the 
appropriateness 
of 
this 
approach. 
56. 
Although 
integrating 
sectoral support 
into 
the 
PRSP 
would 
reduce 
transaction 
costs and 
strengthen 
the 
leverage 
of 
central 
ministries 
to 
achieve 
alignment 
of 
sector programs 
with 
the 
PRS 
priorities, 
there 
are also 
several 
potential 
risks. 
These 
include 
the 
risk 
that the 
coordination 
requirements  inherent 
in 
a 
multisectoral 
operation 
might 
overstretch 
human 
resources 
and 
institutional 
capacities, 
the 
increased 
risk 
to 
budget 
predictability 
if 
a 
significant 
amount 
of 
resources 
is 
provided 
through 
a 
single 
instrument, 
and 
the 
potential 
for 
a 
loss 
of 
donor cohesion 
and 
partnership 
if 
possibilities 
for 
participation 
in 
well-defined 
joint 
sector  approaches 
are 
reduced. 
Further 
work 
to 
clarify 
these 
issues 
will 
be 
undertaken 
in 
preparation 
of 
the 
CAS. 
In 
line 
with 
the proposed 
graduated approach 
to 
the 
integration 
of 
sector 
issues 
in 
the 
PRSC. 
A 
decision 
on 
the 
subsequent 
integration 
of 
other 
sectors 
in 
the 
PRSC 
will 
be 
made based 
on 
the 
experience 
gained 
in 
Tanzania 
as 
well 
as 
other 
countries. 
57. 
The 
proposed 
PRSCl 
is 
a 
blend 
of 
a 
credit 
and an 
IDA 
grant. 
The fiscal 
2001-03 
Tanzania 
CAS 
provided 
for 
HIPC 
debt 
relief 
to 
enable 
the 
country 
to 
increase spending 
for 
poverty-focused 
programs. 
The 
government 
intends 
to 
use 
the 
IDA 
grant  component 
to 
protect 
or 
increase 
allocation 
of 
resources 
to 
sectors 
with 
the 
largest 
impact 
on 
poverty 
and 
human 
development. 
Within 
each 
sector, 
poverty 
priorities 
are 
being 
specified 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
Tanzania 
PRS 
and 
its 
annual 
updates. 
Domestic 
support 
for 
reforms 
is 
particularly 
important 
at 
this 
stage 
to 
cushion 
against a 
potential 
backlash 
from 
privatization 
of 
the 
large 
utilities 
and 
infrastructure 
and 
ensure 
continuance 
of 
the 
focus 
on 
supporting 
poverty 
reduction  beyond 
the 
tenure 
of 
the  current 
reformist 
president. 
IDA 
grants 
will 
therefore 
enable and sustain a 
virtuous 
cycle 
of 
reforms. 
B. 
Supporting 
PRS 
Implementation 
through 
a 
PRSC 
58. 
The 
primary aim 
of 
the 
PRSC 
is 
to 
facilitate 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
PRS 
through 
budget 
support and 
monitor 
whether 
adequate 
progress 
is 
being 
made 
toward 
the 
objectives 
defined 
in 
the 
PRSC, 
including 
progress 
toward 
the 
MDGs. 
Particular 
emphasis 
is 
put 
on 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
adequate 
monitoring 
framework 
in 
line 
with 
the 
poverty 
monitoring 
master 
plan. 
Disbursements made according 
to 
the 
PRSC 
framework 
will 
be 
contingent 
on 
progress 
toward 
the 
PRS 
objectives 
in 
the 
medium 
term. The 
objective 
of 
the 
PRSC’s 
monitoring 
function, 
using 
the 
PRS 
monitoring 
framework, 
is 
to 
provide 
the authorities 
with 
financial 
resources and leverage 
to 
coordinate 
sector 
development programs 
with 
the 
PRS. 
In 
those 
areas 
where 
the 
PRSC 
focuses 
on 
outcome 
monitoring, 
the 
policy 
dialogue  generally 
takes 
place 
in 
the 
context 
of 
sector 
development 
programs, 
particularly 
in 
health 
and 
education. 
59. 
Aside 
from 
monitoring 
overall 
PRS 
objectives, 
the 
PRSC 
is 
also  a 
vehicle 
for 
policy 
dialogue 
on 
selected 
areas 
of 
the 
PRS 
agenda. 
Figure 
3 
shows 
areas 
of 
the 
PRS 
where 
the 
PRSC 
will 
mainly 
focus 
on 
the 
monitoring 
of 
outcomes and those 
areas 
where 
the 
PRSC 
will 
provide 
the 
framework 
for policy 
dialogue 
and 
the 
implementation 
of 
specific 
actions. 
60. 
With 
respect 
to 
most 
of 
the 
components 
of 
Tanzania’s 
strategy 
to 
enhance 
human 
capabilities, 
survival, 
and 
well-being-including 
health, 
education, 
social 
well-being, 
vulnerability, and 
environment-the 
PRSC 
will 
mainly 
focus 
on 
the 
establishment 
of 
appropriate 
monitoring 
systems 
and the 
actual 
monitoring 
of 
progress 
toward 
the 
PRS 
objectives. 
Financial 
support and 
technical 
assistance 
in 
these 
areas 
is 
provided through 
a 
series 
of 
sectoral programs, 
including 
sector 
development 
programs 
for 
health 
and education,  supported 
by 
the 
Bank 
and 
other 
donors. 
PRSCl 
and 
PRSC2 
will 
focus 
on 
progress 
in 
institutionalizing 
the 
monitoring 
and 
19 
Page  30
evaluation 
systems, 
and  PRSC3 
will 
include 
an 
assessment 
of 
whether 
implementation 
of 
Tanzania’s 
poverty 
reduction 
strategy 
is 
having 
the 
expected 
impact 
on 
outcomes. 
61. 
The 
policy 
dialogue 
on 
PSD 
and governance, 
which 
was the 
focus 
of 
the 
PSAC, 
will 
be 
continued 
under 
the 
PRSC. 
In 
addition, the PRSC 
will 
also 
serve 
as 
a 
vehicle 
for 
policy 
dialogue 
on 
sustaining macroeconomic stability, 
rural 
development, 
export 
growth,  and 
the 
environment. 
The 
PRSC 
will 
leverage 
the 
Bank’s 
policy 
dialogue,  and other 
Bank 
and 
donor 
instruments 
will 
be 
used 
to 
provide 
technical 
assistance 
to 
define 
and 
implement 
reforms, 
including 
support 
to 
the 
public 
sector 
reform 
program 
(PSRP), 
the 
Parastatal 
Reform 
Commission, 
the 
local 
government 
reform 
program, and 
the 
legal 
sector 
reform 
program. 
Efforts to 
reduce 
income 
poverty 
are 
also 
supported 
through 
infrastructure  projects 
in 
the 
transport 
and 
energy 
sectors 
and support 
to 
the 
ASDP.

62. 
To 
summarize, 
the 
PRSC 
will 
support 
government 
efforts 
to 
reduce 
poverty 
at 
three levels. 
Firstly, 
it 
supports 
measures 
spelt 
out 
in 
the 
PAF 
policy matrix 
that 
are 
expected 
to 
contribute 
directly 
to 
the 
reduction 
of 
income 
poverty. 
This 
includes 
reforms 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
agricultural 
and 
rural 
development 
which 
are 
intended 
to 
raise 
agricultural 
productivity 
and 
thus 
enhance 
the 
incomes 
of 
the 
population 
in 
rural 
areas, 
were 
poverty 
is 
most 
widespread  and 
most 
deeply 
entrenched. 
Private 
sector 
development 
and 
strengthening 
of 
the 
business 
environment, 
and 
legal 
and 
administrative 
reform 
to 
enhance 
the 
functioning 
of 
land,  credit, 
and 
labor 
markets 
are 
intended 
to 
foster 
economic 
growth 
and 
enhance 
employment opportunities, 
as 
access 
to 
formal 
and 
informal 
sector 
employment 
has 
been 
identified 
in 
the 
PRS 
as 
one 
of 
the 
key 
areas 
for 
sustainable 
poverty 
reduction. 
63. 
The 
second 
area 
of 
impact 
is 
through 
monitoring 
and 
leveraging 
progress 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
sectoral programs 
to 
reduce 
poverty, 
covering 
the 
priority 
sectors 
identified 
in 
20 
Page  31
the 
PRS, 
i.e., 
primary 
education,  basic  health, 
water, 
rural 
roads, 
agricultural 
research 
and 
extension, 
the 
judiciary, 
and 
HIV/AIDS. 
The 
PRSC 
policy 
dialogue 
focuses 
on 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
robust 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
system 
that 
allows 
an 
assessment 
of 
the 
impact and 
results 
of 
sectoral 
programs.  The 
information 
derived 
from 
the 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
system 
will 
then  feed 
into 
the 
assessment 
of 
progress 
towards 
the PRS objective, 
on which 
future 
PRSC 
support 
will 
be 
contingent. 
Finally, 
the 
resources 
provided 
through the 
PRSC 
complement 
government and other donor 
resources 
in 
financing 
priority 
programs 
for 
poverty 
reduction. 
The 
well 
developed 
participatory 
PER-MTEF 
process 
provides 
a 
mechanism 
for 
the 
monitoring 
of 
the 
use 
of 
resources. 
64. 
Finally, 
at the 
third 
level 
are 
cross-sectoral actions 
to 
strengthen 
public 
sector 
performance 
and 
enhance 
the 
efficiency 
and 
effectiveness 
in 
the 
use 
of 
resources.  These 
measures 
will 
have 
a 
direct impact 
on 
poverty 
reduction 
as 
they 
enhance 
public 
sector 
capacity 
to 
implement 
poverty 
reduction 
programs 
in 
the 
priority 
sectors 
and 
generate 
additional 
funds 
for 
poverty 
reduction 
by 
reducing 
leakages 
in 
the 
form 
of 
low 
allocative 
or 
operational 
efficiency 
of 
public 
expenditures. 
Key 
areas 
of 
reform 
include 
strengthening 
of 
financial 
management 
through 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
public 
financial 
management 
reform 
program, 
strengthening 
of 
the 
national audit office, 
implementation 
of 
pay 
reform 
coupled 
with 
improved 
performance 
management 
in 
the 
public 
sector, 
procurement  reform,  the 
implementation 
of 
anti-corruption 
strategies,  and  enhanced 
efficiency 
in 
the 
use 
of 
development 
assistance. 
C. 
PRS 
Alignment 
between the 
Bank 
and 
Other 
Donor 
Programs 
in 
Support 
of 
the 
Common Goals 
for  Coordination 
of 
Support 
65. 
Consultations 
with 
the 
government 
and  donors 
emphasized 
four 
main 
goals 
and 
mechanisms 
for 
coordinating 
policy 
dialogue, 
taking 
into 
account 
the 
government’s 
desire 
for 
greater coherence and 
efficiency 
in 
supporting 
poverty reduction 
initiatives 
in 
Tanzania. 
The 
clear 
poverty 
focus 
of 
all 
operations 
is 
guided 
by 
the 
homegrown 
PRS and 
its 
rolling 
updates 
as 
the 
framework 
for 
determining 
priorities 
and 
assessing 
the 
impact 
of 
chosen 
interventions. 
Coherence 
in 
policy 
dialogue  around 
the 
PRS 
and 
the 
progress 
review 
process 
applies 
not 
only 
to 
cross-cutting 
issues 
but 
also 
to 
the 
sector-wide 
approaches. 
Efficiency 
in 
the 
approaches 
to 
policy 
dialogue 
and 
performance 
assessment 
is 
essential 
to 
the 
delivery 
of 
support 
for 
poverty 
reduction. 
Given 
the 
high 
transactions 
cost 
of 
multiple 
policy 
dialogues  and 
forms 
of 
support 
to 
poverty 
reduction, 
a 
common goal 
is 
to 
rationalize 
and 
ensure 
consistency 
of 
dialogue 
and 
performance 
assessment. 
There 
is 
a 
strong 
plea 
by 
all 
parties 
involved 
for 
a 
unified 
performance 
assessment 
process, 
with 
room 
for 
individual 
judgment. 
Enhanced 
flexibility 
and 
predictability 
of 
resource 
flows 
is 
achieved 
by 
adopting 
a 
medium-term framework 
and 
offering 
support 
through 
the 
budget 
(exchequer).

Through

and 
strategic 
expenditure

and mechanisms 
for

1. 
The 
PRS 
approved 
in 
August 
2000 
provides 
the 
framework 
for 
result-oriented 
poverty reduction interventions 
by 
the 
government, 
its 
external 
partners, 
and 
the 
private 
sector. 
Priority 
sector 
programs 
are 
integrated 
into 
this 
framework through 
planned 
actions 
to 
meet 
the 
PRS 
targets, 
and 
a 
common 
poverty monitoring 
system 
has 
been 
adopted. 
PRS 
progress 
reports 
serve 
both 
monitoring 
and 
updating 
purposes. 
2. 
The 
TAS 
has 
been adopted 
as 
the 
framework 
for 
improving 
the 
overall impact 
of 
development 
assistance 
on 
Tanzania’s 
development. 
3. 
The 
country-led 
annual 
PERs 
provide 
participatory 
open 
review 
of 
the 
effectiveness 
and 
integrity 
of 
public 
spending 
as 
well 
as 
public 
expenditure 
management. 
The 
MTEF, 
developed under 
a participatory  PER 
process, 
is 
the 
main 
strategic resource 
allocation 
mechanism. 
4. 
The 
PSRP 
focuses 
on 
providing 
coordinated 
support 
for improving public 
service 
delivery. 
5. 
The 
national framework 
for 
good 
governance 
supports 
anticorruption 
programs, 
enhancement 
of 
democratic  practices, 
devolution 
of 
authority  to 
lower-level 
government 
and 
communities, 
and 
legal 
reforms 
to underpin positive 
changes 
in 
the 
conduct 
of 
business. 
6. 
Annual 
Consultative 
Group 
meetings 
have been 
held 
in 
Tanzania 
for 
the 
past 
three 
years 
and 
have 
focused 
on 
the 
joint 
review 
of 
PRS 
implementation. 
7. 
There 
are 
ongoing efforts 
for 
further 
harmonization 
of 
these 
processes 
to 
reduce 
duplication 
and 
ensure 
consistency 
of 
advice. 
Alignment 
with Other 
Bank 
Operations 
Related 
to 
the 
PRS 
and 
Sector 
Development 
68. 
The  Bank’s 
support 
for 
priority 
sectors 
and 
cross-cutting 
programs 
has 
been 
broadly 
aligned 
with 
the 
implementation 
of 
the  PRS. 
Support 
for 
basic 
education 
is 
being 
provided 
through a 
three-year 
Sectoral 
Adjustment 
Loan 
(SECAL), 
which 
became 
effective 
in 
January 
2002. 
In 
its 
first 
year 
after 
being put 
into 
effect, 
it 
is 
running 
concurrently 
with 
the 
PSAC 
and 
will 
run 
thereafter 
with 
PRSCl 
and PRSC2. 
Support 
for 
the 
health 
sector 
is 
provided through 
an 
8- 
year 
adaptable 
programmatic loan 
(APL), 
which 
will 
run 
concurrently 
with 
the 
proposed 
PRSCl 
. 
Coordination 
between 
the 
two 
is 
enabled 
by 
the 
PRS 
process. 
There 
is 
also 
an 
11-year 
APL 
to 
support 
public 
service 
reforms 
in 
collaboration 
with 
donors. 
A 
prospective 
accountability 
and 
governance 
operation 
(ATIP) 
is 
under 
preparation 
and 
will 
provide 
technical 
support 
for 
strengthening legal, 
procurement, 
audit, 
and 
watchdog 
systems. 
Although 
not directly 
integrated 
into 
the 
support 
envisaged under 
the 
PRSC, 
these 
and 
other 
individual 
projects 
and 
programs 
in 
the 
Bank’s 
portfolio 
dovetail 
with 
Tanzania’s 
overall 
PRS. 
Specific  projects 
to 
support 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
PRS 
include 
rural 
water, 
rural 
roads, 
and 
local 
government 
support 
projects, 
all 
of 
which 
are

Alignment 
with the 
PRBS 
69. 
The 
government 
has 
reached agreement 
with 
11 
donors6, 
accounting 
for 
more than 
60 
percent 
of 
total official 
development 
assistance 
to 
Tanzania, 
to 
establish 
the 
PRBS 
facility 
to 
support 
the 
implementation 
of 
the  PRS. 
Using 
this 
facility, 
the 
donors  have 
agreed 
to 
seek 
improved 
flexibility, 
reporting, and 
predictability 
of 
flows 
through 
the 
budget. 
To 
ensure 
impact, 
the 
government 
and donors 
have 
agreed 
on 
a 
rolling,  annually reviewed 
and updated 
PAF 
for 
monitoring 
progress 
in 
implementing 
agreed 
reforms 
under 
the 
PRBS. 
These 
reforms 
target 
improved 
effectiveness 
of 
public 
services, 
a better 
incentive 
environment, 
minimized 
resource 
leakage, 
and 
strengthened 
accountability. 
To 
unify 
policy 
dialogue 
and 
minimize 
costs 
associated 
with 
multiple 
dialogues, 
the 
PRBS  donors  and 
the 
government 
have 
decided 
to 
use 
existing 
processes 
for 
policy 
dialogue. 
70. 
The 
PRSC 
program, 
aligned 
with 
the 
PRBS and 
the 
PAF, 
serves 
as 
the 
joint 
framework 
within 
which 
prior 
actions 
for 
each 
PRSC 
are developed and 
assessed. 
Consistency 
of 
milestones 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
two 
processes 
and performance 
assessment 
will 
be 
ensured 
through 
a 
common 
review 
process 
and 
harmonized 
policy 
dialogue. 
Both 
the 
PRSC 
and 
the 
PRBS 
are 
single- 
or 
two-tranche 
operations 
with 
release 
of 
funds 
based 
on 
prior 
actions 
or 
overall 
performance 
assessment. 
The 
joint 
PRBS-PRSC 
1 
framework 
for 
supporting 
poverty reduction 
in 
Tanzania 
has 
four 
key 
objectives: 
(1) 
harmonizing 
support 
through 
the 
budget 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
PRS;  (2) 
adopting 
a 
common PAF, 
and PRSC 
prior 
actions 
within 
it, 
centered 
on 
the 
PRS 
action 
plan, 
relying 
primarily 
on 
Tanzania’s 
own 
poverty 
monitoring 
framework 
for 
assessment; 
(3) 
agreeing 
on 
a 
framework 
for 
financing implementation 
of 
the 
PRS 
to 
ensure 
improved predictability 
and smooth 
availability 
of 
required 
resources 
consistent 
with 
the budget 
cycle; 
and 
(4) 
agreed 
joint 
preparation 
and 
review 
cycles 
for 
the 
PRBS 
and 
PRSC 
to 
minimize 
transactions 
costs 
and 
ensure 
consistency 
in 
policy 
dialogue. 
7 
1. 
To 
these 
ends, 
a 
draft 
Partnership 
Framework Memorandum 
has 
been 
agreed 
among 
the 
development 
partners 
and 
with 
the 
government 
as 
a basis 
for 
harmonizing 
the 
PRBS 
and PRSC 
instruments 
(annex 
9). 
It 
lays  out 
the 
principles 
for 
coordination 
of 
financing 
to 
ensure 
predictable 
and 
smooth 
flows 
and 
pays 
particular 
attention 
to 
anchoring 
support, dialogue, 
and 
monitoring 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
PRS; 
minimizing 
transactions 
costs; 
and 
ensuring 
consistency 
of 
policy 
dialogue. 
72. 
A 
PAF 
has 
been 
fully 
discussed 
with 
individual 
ministries, 
departments, 
and 
agencies 
(MDAs) 
for priority 
and 
feasible actions. 
As 
is 
the 
case 
for 
other 
participating 
donors, 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the PAF, 
the 
Bank 
retains 
flexibility 
to 
determine specific 
benchmarks 
and 
form 
an 
independent 
judgment 
as 
to 
whether 
significant 
progress 
has 
been 
made. 
The 
individual 
financing 
agreements 
under 
the 
PRBS 
provide 
for 
different 
judgments 
of 
performance 
assessment 
and 
any 
other 
additional 
considerations. 
However, 
all 
involved 
parties  encourage 
minimizing 
such 
differences, 
which would 
undermine 
efficiency 
objectives 
and 
predictability 
of 
resource 
flows. 
Gradual 
achievement 
of 
a 
common 
PAF 
is 
envisaged and 
analytic 
work 
toward 
this 
goal 
has 
been 
planned. 
Alignment with 
the 
PRGF 
73. 
The 
PRSC 
is 
closely  coordinated 
with 
the 
PRGF 
according 
to 
the 
agreed 
institutional 
division 
of 
labor, 
with 
the 
IMF 
taking 
the 
lead 
on 
macroeconomic 
sector 
issues 
and 
the 
Bank 
The 
donors 
involved 
are 
Canada, 
Denmark, Finland, Ireland, 
Japan, 
the Netherlands, 
Norway, 
Sweden, 
Switzerland, 
the 
United 
Kingdom, 
and 
the 
European 
Union.

taking 
the 
lead 
on 
structural and social 
issues. 
In 
a 
number 
of 
areas 
where 
the 
mandates 
of 
the 
two 
institutions 
overlap, 
they 
will 
coordinate 
and 
work 
closely 
together 
to 
ensure 
that 
consistent 
advice 
is 
provided 
to 
the  authorities. 
Maintained 
macrostability 
is 
a 
prior 
action 
for 
PRSC 
releases, 
and 
the 
IMF 
Article 
IV 
and 
PRGF 
reviews 
will 
be 
an 
important 
input 
into 
the 
assessment 
of 
the macroeconomic 
situation 
by 
the 
Bank. Similarly, 
it 
is 
expected 
that the 
IMF 
will 
rely 
on 
the Bank’s 
assessment 
of 
structural 
and 
social reforms. 
With 
respect 
to 
the 
timing 
of 
operations, 
the 
PRGF 
and PRSC 
are 
aligned 
with 
the 
PRS 
review 
process, 
including 
the 
work 
on 
joint 
staff 
assessments. 
Harmonization 
and 
Alignment 
of 
Processes 
74. 
The 
government 
budget 
process 
provides 
the 
key 
anchor 
for 
the 
PRSC 
and 
PRBS 
and 
most 
other 
integrative 
processes. 
Because 
one 
of 
the 
objectives 
is 
to 
enhance 
the 
predictability 
of 
donor 
assistance, 
the 
processes are sequenced 
with 
the 
objective 
of 
providing 
a 
firm 
commitment 
to 
the 
availability 
of 
budget 
support 
in 
the 
next 
fiscal 
year 
before 
the 
government’s 
budget 
speech 
in 
June. 
Negotiation 
of 
PRSCs 
will 
thus 
typically 
take 
place 
in 
March 
to 
allow 
government 
to 
factor 
PRSC support 
into 
the budget 
preparation. 
Similarly 
for 
the 
PRBS 
donors, 
the 
annual 
review 
takes 
place 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
although 
not 
all 
donors are able 
to 
make 
firm 
commitments 
for 
the 
full 
year at 
that 
time 
and 
some 
donors 
release 
their 
budget 
support 
in 
two 
or 
more 
tranches. 
The 
annual PRS 
progress 
report 
and 
its 
joint 
staff 
assessment 
will 
typically 
be 
issued 
concurrently 
with 
or 
shortly before 
the 
PRBS 
annual 
review 
and PRSC 
negotiations. 
D. 
Results 
Orientation 
of 
Tanzania 
PRSC 
Operations 
75. 
The 
results 
orientation 
of 
the PRSC covers 
two 
levels. Foremost, 
the 
PRSC supports 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
PRS. Broad-based 
progress 
toward 
achieving 
the PRS objectives 
is 
the 
key 
results 
area 
against 
which 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
PRSC  support 
should 
be 
judged. 
This 
area 
of 
results 
orientation 
is 
reflected 
in 
the 
PRSC 
through 
the 
strong focus 
on 
establishing 
a 
robust 
M&E 
system 
for 
the 
PRSC 
and 
the 
development 
of 
indicators that 
allow 
continuous 
tracking 
of 
progress 
in 
the 
pursuit 
of 
the 
PRS targets. 
These 
indicators, 
combined 
with 
the 
more 
substantive 
analysis 
of 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
PRS 
in 
the 
annual 
PHDRs 
and 
the 
annual 
PRS 
progress 
reports, 
will 
inform 
decisions 
on 
the 
continuation 
and 
design 
of 
subsequent 
PRSC support. 
A 
set 
of 
annual and 
intermittent 
indicators 
developed 
by 
the  government 
in 
consultation 
with 
other 
stakeholders 
(see 
annex 
7) 
are 
to 
be 
included 
in 
the 
next 
PHDR. 
Additionally, 
the 
range 
of 
complementary 
mechanisms 
(see 
annex 
13 
for 
a 
list) 
would 
allow for 
a 
fuller 
assessment 
of 
the 
progress 
in 
meeting 
the 
PRS 
targets 
and 
MDGs. 
In 
particular,  regular 
sector 
reviews, 
jointly 
undertaken 
by 
the 
government  and 
other 
stakeholders, 
are  an 
important 
mechanism 
for 
semiannually 
assessing 
progress 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
sector 
development programs 
for 
such 
key 
sectors 
such 
as 
health 
and 
education. Sector 
review 
mechanisms 
for 
water 
and sanitation, and 
the 
broader 
agriculture 
and 
rural 
development 
and 
PSD 
areas, 
are 
also 
being 
instituted.

It

in 
these

that, good progress 
has 
been

by 
Government 
in 
a 
number 
of 
areas 
with 
respect 
to 
achieving 
the intermediate 
(2003) 
PRS 
targets. 
Thus, 
the 
PRSC operations 
are 
intended 
to 
play 
a 
complementary, supportive, and 
monitoring 
role 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
sectoral 
and 
cross-sectoral programs 
in 
primary 
education, health, water 
and

to  highlight 
the 
substantive 
and 
outcome/impact-oriented 
results 
embedded 
within 
the 
various 
PRSCl 
actions.

of 
the

to 
be 
undertaken 
in 
the 
context 
of

of 
two

78. 
The 
second 
level 
of 
results 
orientation 
refers 
to 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
actions 
identified 
in 
the 
PAF 
policy 
matrix. 
These 
actions 
are 
broadly 
intended 
to 
create 
an  adequate 
policy 
and 
institutional 
framework that 
is 
conducive 
to 
the 
achievement 
of 
the 
PRS targets.  Results 
are 
defined 
as 
substantive 
policy 
and 
institutional 
changes, 
and 
the 
actions 
outlined 
in 
the 
PAF 
policy 
matrix 
are 
steps 
toward 
the 
achievement 
of 
these  results. 
Clearly, 
however, 
as 
for all 
donor- 
27 
Page  38
government 
programs, 
determining 
a 
one-on-one  correspondence 
between the 
PRSC 
and 
the 
achievement 
of 
the 
PRS 
targets (and 
MDGs) 
is 
impossible. 
In 
fact, 
the 
level 
of 
attribution 
of 
PRSC 
actions 
to 
PRS 
targets, 
and 
particularly 
to 
the 
MDGs, 
is 
equally 
difficult for 
the 
productive 
(in 
this 
case, 
for 
PSD 
and agriculture) and 
the 
social 
sectors. 
For 
example, 
the target 
of 
increasing 
the 
share 
of 
income 
or 
consumption 
of 
the 
poorest 
20 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
(one 
of 
the 
MDGs) 
is 
influenced 
by 
more 
than 
just 
interventions 
to 
generate 
agricultural 
growth, 
although 
these 
interventions 
will 
certainly 
have 
an 
impact. 
With 
respect 
to 
the 
social 
sectors, 
the 
PRSC 
operation 
will 
put 
in 
place a 
broadly 
enhanced 
policy-governance-institutional 
framework 
that 
will 
support 
more 
effective implementation 
of 
the 
ongoing or upcoming 
sector-wide programs.

Analytic Underpinnings 
of 
the 
PRSC 
79. 
The 
PRSC 
is 
built 
on 
the analytic 
and 
participatory 
work 
that 
went 
into 
the 
development 
of 
the 
PRS. 
In 
addition, 
analytical 
work 
has 
been 
carried 
out 
which 
informs 
the 
PRSC 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
adequacy 
of 
policies 
and 
institutions 
in 
areas 
relating 
to 
fiduciary 
and 
environmental 
safeguards.

Poverty 
assessment: 
A 
poverty 
assessment 
based 
on 
the 
1991 
HBS 
and the 
1994 
human 
resource 
development survey 
was 
carried 
out 
in 
1995 
and integrated 
into 
the 
1995 
CEM 
to 
merge 
the 
analysis 
of 
economic 
growth 
and 
poverty. 
As 
part 
of 
PRS 
monitoring 
and 
building 
on 
the 
HI3S 
2000 
data 
as 
a 
baseline, 
the 
government prepared 
the 
first 
PHDR, 
which 
provides 
a 
full 
poverty 
assessment 
with 
subsequent 
annual 
updates. 
The 
first 
PHDR 
was 
finalized 
after 
open 
review 
during 
Tanzania’s 
poverty 
policy 
week 
held 
in 
September 2002. 
81. 
Country 
economic 
memorandum: 
The 
last 
CEM 
was 
prepared 
in 
2000, 
with 
close 
collaboration 
among 
government, 
the 
Bank,  and 
international 
and 
local 
research 
institutes. 
It 
focused 
primarily 
on 
economic growth, 
with 
particular 
attention 
to 
the 
agricultural 
sector 
and 
contained a detailed 
look 
at 
poverty 
and 
its 
linkage 
to 
economic 
growth 
in 
Tanzania.

Public

A 
recent 
country  financial

(CFAA) 
carried out 
in 
collaboration 
between donors 
and

and 
codes (ROSC), 
and a 
joint 
Bank-IMF

capacity 
to 
track 
poverty- 
reducing 
expenditure  have 
all 
noted 
the 
improvements 
in 
public  financial 
management 
and 
fiduciary 
systems. 
They 
have  also 
identified 
specific 
actions 
for 
dealing 
with 
weaknesses 
in 
coordinating 
support and 
policy 
dialogue 
on 
these 
issues 
as 
a 
key 
feature 
of 
the 
PRSC 
reform 
agenda. 
84. 
Procurement: 
A 
country 
procurement 
assessment 
report (CPAR) 
was  prepared 
during 
fiscal 
2003, 
and 
annex 
10 presents 
the 
main 
findings. 
In 
recent 
years, 
the 
Bank 
has 
continuously 
assisted 
the 
government 
in 
redesigning 
its 
procurement 
system, 
undertaking reforms 
and 
making 
assessments 
of 
progress achieved 
along 
the 
way. 
In 
2001, 
Tanzania 
passed 
a 
new 
procurement 
law, 
underpinning 
the 
reforms, and 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
has 
issued 
regulations 
to 
guide 
their 
implementation. 
The 
drafts 
for 
the 
new 
law 
and 
regulations 
were 
reviewed 
by 
Bank 
procurement 
specialists 
and 
passed 
as 
a basis 
for 
effective controls 
and 
integrity. 
85. 
Environmental 
aspects: 
Tanzania’s 
PRSCl 
is 
a Sectoral 
Adjustment 
Credit 
(SECAC), 
and 
it 
has 
been 
classified 
as 
category 
C, 
hence 
no 
formal 
environment impact 
assessment 
(EIA) 
is 
required. 
However, 
in 
an 
effort 
to 
mainstream 
the 
environmental 
sustainability 
dimension 
into 
the 
PRSC 
process, 
the 
Bank 
has 
undertaken 
an analysis 
with 
the 
objective 
of 
identifying 
linkages 
between 
key 
macroeconomic 
and 
structural 
reforms 
policies 
and 
the 
environment. 
This 
analysis 
will 
develop 
a 
set 
of 
measures 
at 
both 
the 
national 
and 
the 
local 
government levels that 
can 
be 
taken 
to 
reduce 
poverty 
and 
enhance 
environmental 
sustainability 
of 
policy 
reforms. 
The 
underlying 
premise 
of 
the 
analysis 
is 
that 
environment 
and 
poverty 
are 
linked 
in 
three 
major 
ways: 
(1) 
Poverty 
reduction 
programs 
should 
not 
damage 
the 
resource 
base 
and 
the 
environment 
on 
which 
poor 
people 
depend 
for 
their 
livelihoods; 
(2) 
improving 
environmental conditions 
can 
help 
to 
reduce 
poverty 
and 
promote 
sustainable 
pro-poor  growth;  and 
(3) 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
identify 
any 
mitigating 
measures, 
as 
needed, 
as 
part 
of 
policy 
dialogue. 
In 
working 
with 
the 
government and other 
development 
partners, 
the 
analysis 
should therefore 
help 
identify 
strategic 
entry points 
for 
mainstreaming 
key 
issues 
of 
the 
poverty-environment 
nexus 
in 
Tanzania 
into 
the 
PRSC 
process 
and 
ongoing 
policy 
reforms 
in 
general. 
In 
this 
regard, 
the 
PRSC2 and 
PRSC3 
reform 
agenda 
has 
specified 
actions 
to 
be 
implemented 
by 
the 
government. 
86. 
Poverty 
and Social Impact 
Analysis: 
Social 
assessments 
have 
been 
an 
integral 
part 
of 
the 
preparation 
process 
of 
the 
PRS 
as 
well 
as 
of 
the 
various 
sector 
programs. 
Participatory 
poverty 
assessments 
(PPAs) 
are 
being 
carried out 
as 
part 
of 
the 
monitoring 
of 
the 
PRS 
implementation. 
In 
addition, 
local 
independent research 
institutes have 
carried 
out 
a 
variety 
of 
social 
assessments 
of 
specific 
reform 
initiatives. 
The 
most 
recent 
of 
these are 
an 
assessment 
of 
the 
public 
perception 
of 
progress 
in 
implementing 
anticorruption 
plans and a 
PPA. 
The 
analytic 
agenda 
under 
the 
poverty 
monitoring 
master 
plan 
includes 
poverty 
and social 
impact 
assessments 
of 
key 
reforms 
monitored 
under  the 
framework. 
This 
includes 
work 
supported 
by 
the 
Bank 
011 
the 
impact 
of 
rural 
development 
reforms 
on 
poverty 
in 
Tanzania. 
The 
planned 
PSIA 
will 
inform 
the 
design 
of 
these 
rural 
development 
reforms 
and 
establish 
the 
baseline 
for 
the 
future 
evaluation 
of 
the 
effectiveness 
and 
impact 
of 
these 
reforms.

MEDIUM-TERM 
PROGRAM FOR 
POLICY 
DIALOGUE 
AND 
PERFORMANCE 
ASSESSMENT 
UNDER 
THE 
PRSC 
88. 
The 
medium-term 
program 
supports 
the 
implementation 
of 
Tanzania’s 
PRS, 
as 
summarized 
in 
the 
PRSP 
of 
2000 
and 
subsequent 
updates 
undertaken 
with 
annual  progress 
reports. 
Policy 
dialogue and 
the 
performance 
assessment 
framework 
under the 
PRSC 
focus 
on 
cross-cutting 
and 
institutional 
actions 
under 
the 
PRS 
themes. 
After 
the 
approval 
of 
Tanzania’s 
PRSP 
in 
2000, 
the 
first 
and second 
PRS 
progress reports 
updated 
subthematic 
coverage, 
but 
the 
main 
objectives have 
been 
retained. 
The 
PRS 
goals, 
including 
the 
policies 
to 
reach 
them 
and 
the 
indicators 
to 
monitor 
them, 
are described 
in 
the 
PRSC 
policy 
matrix. 
89. 
The 
broad 
thrust 
of 
the 
PRSC three-year 
program 
builds 
on 
recent macroeconomic  and 
structural 
reforms 
undertaken 
by 
Tanzania 
and 
focuses 
on 
the 
following 
areas 
of 
the 
PRS 
objectives: 
(a) 
Reducing income poverty through 
strengthening 
private 
sector 
participation 
to 
support 
increased 
growth 
of 
the 
rural 
economy and 
SMEs, 
on 
which 
the 
majority 
of 
Tanzania’s 
poor 
depend 
for 
their 
livelihood; 
(b) 
strengthening 
human  capabilities 
and 
social 
well-being 
through 
improved 
monitoring 
and  evaluation 
of 
sector 
programs 
to 
ensure 
achievement 
of 
outcomes 
and impacts 
on 
the 
livelihoods 
of 
Tanzanians; 
(c) 
sustaining 
an 
environment conducive 
to 
development 
by 
actions 
to 
maintain 
macroeconomic 
stability 
and a 
tax 
regime 
friendly 
to 
growth 
and 
PSD, 
improve 
effectiveness 
of 
delivery 
of 
public 
services at 
all 
levels 
of 
government, 
adopt 
a performance-based 
system 
in 
public 
service, 
strengthen 
the 
public 
watchdog 
role,  and 
minimize 
resource  leakage 
and 
improved 
accountability; 
and 
(d) 
ensuring 
environmentally 
sustainable 
development 
through 
mainstreaming environmental 
concerns 
in 
the 
PRS process. 
90. 
More 
specifically,  the focus 
of 
actions supported 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
PRSC 
interventions 
relates 
to 
measures 
aimed 
at 
reducing 
income 
poverty through efforts 
to 
boost 
GDP 
growth 
in 
the 
medium 
term 
by 
promoting higher 
private 
investment, 
reducing 
the 
cost 
of 
doing 
business, 
and 
enhancing 
the 
efficiency 
of 
the Tanzanian 
economy. 
Thus, 
to 
disseminate 
broadly 
the 
impact 
of 
both 
reforms 
and resultant 
growth to 
the 
rural 
income 
poor,  support 
will 
be

other 
things, 
enhancement 
of 
the 
profitability 
of

of

of 
rural origin 
in 
particular-through 
better

productivity, 
reduced 
marketing 
costs,

In 
addition 
to 
continued efforts 
targeted at 
improving 
the 
private 
investment 
climate 
and 
strengthening  the  performance 
of 
the 
rural 
economy, 
there 
is 
now 
a  need 
to 
bring 
the 
development 
budget 
of 
the 
GOT 
in 
line 
with 
the 
strategic 
public 
investment requirements 
to 
meet 
the 
PRS targets 
and 
support 
the 
growth 
of 
the 
private 
sector 
contribution 
to 
the 
economy 
and 
livelihoods. 
In 
this 
regard,  focus 
should 
now 
turn 
to 
aligning 
government 
policies 
and 
expenditure programs 
with 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
PRS 
and enhancing 
the 
efficiency 
of 
public 
service 
delivery. 
Support 
is 
also 
provided 
for building 
on 
processes 
that 
have 
been 
put 
in 
place 
to 
enhance 
the 
strategic 
allocation 
of 
public 
resources 
for 
poverty 
reduction, 
increasing 
the 
* 
The 
PRSC 
policy 
matrix 
(or 
PAF) 
provides a substantially 
harmonized 
set 
of 
policy 
actions 
in 
support 
of 
the 
PRS. 
In 
the context 
of 
the 
PRSC, 
both 
the 
PRBS 
donors 
and 
the 
World 
Bank 
will 
avoid introducing 
new 
targets, 
indicators, 
or 
measures 
that 
are 
outside the 
PAF 
and the 
IMF 
macroeconomic 
annex. 
It 
is 
the 
intention 
of 
the parties 
to 
harmonize 
the 
PRS 
action 
plan 
and 
the 
PAF 
completely 
within 
three 
years. The 
PAF 
will 
be used 
as 
a 
tool 
for 
dialogue 
on 
PRS 
implementation 
and progress, 
and 
PAF 
actions 
will 
help to 
determine appropriate levels 
of 
future funding for 
the 
general 
budget. 
Through a continuous 
process, 
it 
will 
allow 
the government and 
the 
donors 
to 
assess 
progress 
toward 
agreed 
medium-term 
objectives 
and 
the 
implementation 
status 
of 
specific 
measures.

with

Governance 
and 
accountability 
strengthening 
measures 
are 
primarily 
aimed 
at 
improvement 
of 
public 
service 
delivery 
through 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
key 
components 
of 
the 
PSRP, 
the 
local 
government 
reform 
program, and 
the 
legal 
sector reforms, 
as 
well 
as 
fiscal 
and 
fiduciary 
measures 
(primarily 
implementation 
of 
the 
key 
recommendations 
from 
the 
PER, 
the 
CFAA, 
and 
the 
poverty 
expenditure 
tracking 
assessment), 
aimed 
at 
strengthening 
public 
expenditure 
management and enhancing transparency. 
93. 
Finally, 
a 
crucial 
ingredient 
in 
the 
effective  implementation 
of 
the 
PRS 
is 
a 
robust 
mechanism 
for 
regular and 
adequate 
monitoring 
of 
poverty, 
social 
well-being,  and 
environmental 
sustainability 
information 
and 
related 
analyses 
to 
facilitate 
a 
meaningful 
assessment 
of 
the 
PRS 
process. 
The 
program 
will 
support 
the 
Tanzania’s 
efforts 
to 
foster 
an effective 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
mechanism.

A. 
REDUCING 
INCOME 
POVERTY 
Private 
Sector Development 
(PSD) 
95. 
The 
Letter 
of 
Development 
Policy 
(LDP) 
for 
the 
ongoing 
Tanzania 
PSACl 
identified 
a 
set 
of 
actions 
in 
support 
of 
private 
sector 
growth 
to 
be 
implemented 
over 
a 
four-year 
period. 
It 
focused 
on 
improving 
the 
private 
investment 
climate through improved 
economic 
governance, 
improved 
business 
environment, 
privatization 
and 
regulation 
favoring 
competition. 
Actions 
for 
improving 
the 
business 
environment 
target 
legal 
reforms 
for 
enforcing property 
rights, 
further 
lowering 
the 
business 
costs 
of 
the 
tax 
regime,  and 
minimizing 
the 
scope 
for 
policy 
reversals. 
Privatization 
and  regulation 
target 
the 
provision 
of 
lower-cost 
and 
adequate 
infrastructure 
services 
to help 
reduce 
the 
cost 
of 
doing 
business 
in 
Tanzania and strengthen 
the 
competitiveness 
of 
Tanzanian 
business. 
PSACl 
supported 
the 
implementation 
of 
these 
actions 
for 
the 
first 
two 
years. 
Tangible 
results 
include 
the 
advancement 
of 
the 
privatization 
agenda, 
with 
government 
disengagement 
from 
commercial 
activities  almost  completed 
and 
significant 
progress 
toward 
greater 
private 
sector 
involvement 
in 
the 
provision 
of 
utilities; 
progress 
in 
strengthening 
the 
business 
environment 
by 
restructuring 
the 
Tanzania  Investment 
Center  and 
reform 
of 
land 
legislation; 
and 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
improved regulatory 
environment. 
The 
proposed 
PRSC 
operation 
will 
pick 
up 
the 
key 
residual 
actions 
to 
ensure 
continuity 
of 
support 
for 
this 
agenda 
and, 
where 
applicable,  sharpen 
its 
poverty 
focus. 
The 
key 
areas 
reflected 
in 
the 
PRSC 
policy matrix 
are 
as 
follows: 
96. 
Inadequacies 
of 
the 
Land 
and Village 
Acts 
and 
slow 
implementation 
of 
their 
provisions: 
As 
agreed 
between 
the 
GOT 
and 
the 
private 
sector 
during 
the 
IRT 
of 
July 
2002, 
the 
Land 
Act, 
as 
currently 
drafted 
poses 
practical 
difficulties 
in 
relation 
to 
collateralization, 
foreclosure,  consent 
by 
spouse, 
customary 
and 
small 
mortgage, 
default 
notice,  and 
third-party 
mortgage. 
Slow 
implementation 
of 
the 
provision 
of 
the 
Land 
and 
Village 
Acts-in 
particular, 
the 
substantial 
delays 
in 
issuing 
title 
deeds, 
is 
also 
of 
concern. 
As 
part 
of 
the 
PRSCl 
actions  and 
after 
consultations 
with 
stakeholders, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Lands 
has 
prepared 
a 
position 
paper 
outlining 
any 
33 
Page  44
changes 
that 
may 
be 
necessary 
to 
the 
Land 
Acts. 
As 
part 
of 
the 
trigger conditions 
for 
the 
PRSC2, 
after 
approval 
of 
the 
proposed 
changes 
to 
the 
Land 
Acts, the government 
will 
draft 
amendments 
to 
the 
Land 
Acts 
and 
submit 
them 
to 
parliament 
for 
approval. 
A 
tentative 
action 
for 
the 
PRSC3 
is 
the 
preparation 
and 
approval 
by 
government 
of 
the 
regulations 
for 
implementing 
the 
amended 
Land 
Acts. 
97. 
Lack 
of 
a 
coherent 
and 
comprehensive 
PSD 
strategy 
and 
SME 
policy: 
There 
is 
currently 
no 
comprehensive 
strategic 
framework 
to 
help 
with 
coordination 
and 
targeting 
of 
the various 
initiatives 
in 
support 
of 
PSD. 
The 
efforts 
so 
far, 
although 
commendable, 
appear 
to 
be 
piecemeal. 
Recognizing 
the 
importance 
of 
SMEs 
in 
employment 
creation 
and 
income 
generation 
and 
the 
need 
to 
encourage 
SME 
development, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Industry 
and Trade 
has 
prepared 
an 
SME 
policy. 
The 
government 
has 
approved 
the 
policy 
for 
SME 
development 
as 
envisaged 
under 
the 
PRSCl 
policy 
matrix 
and launched 
a 
campaign 
for 
public 
awareness 
of 
the 
SME 
development 
policy. 
An 
indicative 
action 
for 
the 
PRSC2 
is 
to 
begin implementation 
of 
the 
policy 
in 
fiscal 
2004. 
The 
government 
has 
also begun 
the 
preparation 
of 
an 
integrated 
PSD 
strategy 
(involving 
comprehensive 
stakeholder  dialogue) 
under 
the  PRSC 1. 
Under 
indicative 
PRSC2 
actions,  the 
government 
will 
complete the preparation 
of 
and 
approve 
the 
PSD 
strategy document, 
which 
will 
include mainstreaming 
SME 
development. 
98. 
Rigid 
labor 
laws  impede 
market-oriented 
deployment 
of 
labor: 
Some 
administrative 
barriers 
to 
the 
importation 
of 
skilled 
labor 
still 
exist 
and 
inconsistencies  and 
contradictions 
remain 
between 
what 
the 
Tanzania Investment 
Center 
presents 
to 
investors 
and 
the 
requirements 
of 
the 
department 
of 
immigration. 
There 
is 
no 
single 
comprehensive 
labor 
law: 
It 
is 
currently 
encompassed 
in 
six 
different, 
outdated pieces 
of 
legislation. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Labour 
is 
leading 
a 
process 
of 
consultations 
with 
stakeholders 
that 
is 
expected 
to 
lead 
to 
the 
definition 
of 
a 
new 
labor 
policy. 
This 
process 
is 
being 
fast-tracked under 
the 
follow-up 
action 
plan 
from 
the 
IRT 
held 
in 
July 
2002. 
Under 
indicative 
actions 
for 
the 
PRSC2, 
after 
consultations 
with 
stakeholders, 
the 
government 
will 
prepare 
a 
new 
labor 
policy 
and 
approve 
it. 
Subsequently, 
in 
the context 
of 
PRSC3 a 
new 
Labor 
Act 
will 
be 
prepared and presented 
to 
parliament 
for 
approval. 
99. 
Need 
to 
improve 
the 
investment 
and 
business 
environment: 
Although 
the 
macroeconomic 
environment 
has 
been 
stabilized 
and 
some 
initiatives 
undertaken 
to 
improve 
the 
business 
climate, 
there 
remains 
a 
significant 
unfinished 
agenda 
in 
enhancing 
the 
investment climate. 
In 
July 
2002, 
the 
GOT 
approved 
the 
BEST 
program 
for 
carrying 
forward 
the 
reform 
agenda 
to 
improve 
the 
business 
environment, 
partly 
supported 
by 
the 
PSAC 
1. 
To 
complete 
one 
of 
the 
prior 
actions 
for 
the 
PRSCl, 
the 
steering 
committee 
of 
the  integrated 
framework 
for 
trade 
has 
approved 
the 
implementation 
plan 
for 
the 
BEST 
program. 
For 
the 
first 
phase 
of 
implementation (July 
2003- 
June 2004), 
the 
plan 
targets 
eight 
priority 
areas 
of 
action: (1) 
harmonization 
of 
local 
government 
taxation 
to 
remove 
excessive 
tax 
burden 
on 
private 
enterprise; 
(2) 
resolution 
of 
outstanding 
issues 
emanating 
from 
the 
Land 
Act; 
(3) 
review 
and 
amendment 
of 
labor 
laws constraining 
business 
operations; 
(4) 
streamlining 
of 
work 
permit 
procedures; 
(5) 
review 
and 
amendment 
of 
licensing 
legislation 
to 
reduce 
the 
cost 
of 
business 
establishment and 
continuation; 
(6) 
review 
and 
revision 
of 
export-import 
procedures 
to 
reduce 
time 
costs 
and 
corruption-related 
costs; 
(7) 
development 
of 
competition policy, 
mainly 
using 
advice 
given 
by 
the 
FIAS; 
and 
(8) 
design and 
implementation 
of 
a 
program 
for 
enhancing 
access 
to 
commercial 
courts 
by 
SMEs. 
The 
establishment 
of 
the 
Better 
Regulation 
Unit 
in 
the 
President’s 
Office-Planning 
and 
Privatization 
to 
oversee 
the 
implementation 
of 
BEST, 
as 
well 
as 
a baseline 
for monitoring 
progress 
in 
efficiency 
indicators 
from 
these 
actions, 
are 
essential 
for 
successful 
implementation 
and 
M&E 
of 
the 
program.

of 
local 
government 
taxes 
and levies 
has 
continued 
to 
be a serious 
issue, 
particularly 
because 
the 
complex 
local 
government 
revenue system 
has 
been 
characterized 
by 
very 
high 
compliance 
and 
administrative 
costs 
as 
well 
as 
considerable 
inefficiency. 
The 
PRSC 
policy matrix 
identifies 
measures 
aimed 
at 
simplifying 
and 
rationalizing local 
government 
taxation 
via 
the 
development 
of 
a strategy 
for 
such 
harmonization 
and 
issuance 
of 
related 
guidelines 
to 
local 
authorities. 
The 
measures 
aimed 
at 
addressing 
the 
key 
issues 
in 
this 
respect are discussed 
in 
some 
detail 
in 
the 
context 
of 
Section 
V.C 
on 
Sustaining 
Macroeconomic Stability. 
Rural 
Development 
102. 
The 
PRSC 
agenda 
with 
respect 
to 
addressing 
the 
challenges 
of 
rural 
development 
is 
focused 
on 
strategic 
planning;  capacity and 
institutional 
arrangement 
for 
implementation 
of 
the 
Agriculture 
Sector 
Development 
Strategy 
(ASDS); 
the 
regulatory 
and 
institutional environment 
for 
agricultural 
trade 
(specifically  taxation 
and 
the 
crop 
boards); 
the 
legal, 
regulatory,  and 
supervisory 
framework 
for 
microfinance; 
implementation 
of 
the 
Land 
Act 
and 
Village 
Land 
Act; 
and 
improvement 
of 
rural 
roads. 
103. 
Accelerated implementation 
of 
the 
ASDP: 
Through broad 
consultation, 
the 
GOT 
prepared 
an 
ASDS 
in 
2001 
and 
intends 
to 
operationalize 
the 
strategy 
through 
an 
ASDP. 
The 
ASDP 
framework 
and 
process document 
prepared 
by 
government 
(a 
PRSCl 
prior 
action) 
provide 
a 
sector-wide 
framework 
for 
overseeing 
the 
institutional, 
expenditure, and 
investment 
priorities 
in 
the 
agricultural 
sector 
and 
will 
be 
the 
government's 
main 
instrument 
for 
coordinating 
and 
monitoring 
agricultural 
development 
in 
the 
country. 
More 
specifically,  the 
ASDP 
will 
establish 
management 
and 
coordination 
procedures 
for 
ASDS 
implementation, 
identify 
priority 
interventions, 
facilitate 
detailed 
formulation 
and 
coordinated 
implementation 
of 
these 
interventions, 
establish  stakeholders' 
forums 
with 
adequate 
representation  and 
participation, 
enhance 
coordination 
of 
cross-sectoral 
issues, 
monitor 
progress, 
and 
assess 
impact. 
Priority 
areas 
of 
the 
ASDP 
include 
the 
policy, 
regulatory,  and 
institutional 
environment;  research 
and 
advisory 
services; 
PSD; 
marketing; 
rural 
finance, 
and 
cross 
cutting 
issues 
of 
land 
and 
rural 
roads. 
This 
should 
result 
in 
lower 
transactions cost 
of 
priority-focused 
interventions 
and 
improve agricultural 
productivity 
and 
profitability, 
the 
key 
objectives 
of 
the 
ASDS. 
104. 
The 
division 
of 
the 
main 
agriculture 
ministry 
into 
three 
separate 
ministries 
(ministries 
of 
agriculture and 
food 
security,  cooperatives and 
marketing; 
and 
livestock 
and 
water) 
is 
creating 
particular 
challenges 
for 
implementation. 
Efficiency 
of 
resources 
used 
and  effectiveness 
of 
service 
delivery 
remain 
key 
concerns. 
The 
fixed 
costs 
associated 
with 
the 
creation 
of 
multiple 
structures 
is 
high, 
and 
problems 
of 
coordination 
and 
duplication 
of 
activities 
have 
hampered 
development 
of 
the ASDP, 
with 
concerns 
that 
these 
will 
persist 
through 
implementation. 
As 
a 
prior 
action 
for 
the 
PRSCl 
the 
government 
has 
finalized 
the 
ASDP 
framework 
and 
process 
document and 
adopted 
it 
for 
implementation.

growth 
and 
reducing

The next 
steps 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
PRSC 
policy matrix 
include 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
ASDP 
secretariat, 
preparation 
of 
monitorable 
benchmarks 
for 
assessing 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
coordination 
mechanisms 
for 
ASDP 
implementation,  and 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
corresponding 
assessment, 
preparation 
of 
follow-up 
options 
for 
improved 
implementation. 
Timely 
inception 
of 
work 
related 
to 
ASDP 
Phase 
I1 
(detailed development 
of 
individual 
components 
and 
subcomponents) 
will 
also 
be 
vital. 
106. 
Further 
review 
and clarification 
of 
the 
roles 
and funding  arrangements 
of 
crop boards: 
The regulatory 
and 
institutional 
environment 
continues 
to 
constrain 
incentives 
for 
agricultural 
export 
growth, 
including 
the 
functioning 
of 
crop 
boards and 
local 
government taxation. 
The 
marketing 
liberalization 
begun 
in 
the 
mid-1990s 
increased 
the 
farmers’ 
share 
of 
the 
border 
price 
37 
Page  48
and 
induced 
higher 
levels 
of 
private 
sector 
investment 
in 
new 
processing 
facilities 
(e.g., 
for 
cashews). 
However, 
in 
many 
cases, 
these 
more 
favorable 
policies 
have 
not 
been 
sustained. 
Export 
crops  are 
currently 
heavily 
taxed, 
heavily 
regulated, 
and  vulnerable 
to 
frequent 
political 
interventions 
that have 
acted 
to 
constrain producer incentives. 
Unnecessary 
regulation 
has 
led 
to 
delays 
in 
marketing,  reduced 
private 
sector 
confidence 
in 
investing 
in 
the 
sector, 
and 
lowered 
prices 
to 
producers. 
Crop 
boards  have  a  substantial 
influence 
on 
agricultural  export  crop 
development 
in 
Tanzania 
and 
their 
roles and 
funding 
arrangements 
need 
to 
be 
further 
reviewed 
and 
clarified 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
ongoing 
concerns 
of 
local 
government 
taxation 
and 
actions 
by 
the 
boards 
that 
have 
not 
always 
been 
in 
the 
best 
interest 
of 
crop producers. 
Delineation 
of 
the 
regulatory, 
service, 
and 
tax 
functions 
by 
public 
and 
private 
sector 
activities 
will 
be 
necessary. 
Key 
areas 
for 
review 
are 
(a) 
clarifying 
and 
limiting 
to 
regulatory functions 
the 
role 
of 
the 
boards, 
(b) 
options 
for 
funding 
the 
crop 
boards 
through 
the 
budget 
and 
removing 
their 
taxation 
function, 
(c) 
removing 
their 
service 
functions 
for 
provision 
by 
the 
private 
sector, 
and 
(d) 
the 
structures 
to 
undertake the 
regulatory functions 
(options 
to 
be 
explored include 
the 
crop 
boards 
as 
separate 
entities 
or 
a 
single 
regulatory 
body). 
Actions 
to 
address 
these issues are 
included 
in 
the 
PAF 
under 
the 
PRSC2 
and 
PRSC3. 
Indicative 
actions 
under 
the 
PRSC2 
include 
agreement 
on 
the 
scope 
and 
modalities 
of 
the review, 
completion 
of 
the 
review 
for 
broader stakeholder discussion, 
and subsequently 
(tentative 
PRSC3 action) amendment 
of 
the 
Crop 
Board 
Acts 
based 
on 
findings 
and 
proposals 
of 
the 
review. 
In 
the 
meantime, 
the  government 
will 
consider 
administrative 
measures 
that 
could 
be 
taken 
to 
address 
these 
concerns. 
107. 
Strengthen 
the 
legal, 
regulatory, 
and 
supervisory 
framework 
for 
microfinance: 
Removing 
constraints 
to 
the 
overall 
business 
environment 
should 
raise 
returns 
to 
economic 
activity 
and 
demand 
for 
financial 
services. 
The 
government 
should 
avoid 
supporting 
any 
distortionary  interventions 
on 
the 
supply 
side, 
such 
as 
the 
establishment 
of 
new  financial 
institutions, 
because these are 
no 
more 
likely 
to 
overcome 
the 
existing 
hurdles 
than 
the 
current 
financial 
institutions. 
Past 
interventions 
have 
not 
worked. 
There have 
been 
a 
number 
of 
efforts 
to 
ensure 
the 
emergence 
of 
more 
efficient 
and  sustainable 
financial 
intermediaries. 
A 
national 
microfinance  policy, 
designed 
along 
industry 
best practices,  was 
prepared 
through 
extensive 
consultation 
with 
microfinance 
donors, 
practitioners, 
and 
other stakeholders. 
It 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
GOT 
and 
in 
place 
by 
May 
2000. 
The 
first 
National 
Conference 
on 
Microfinance, 
whose 
aim 
was 
to 
disseminate 
the 
policy 
and 
provide 
a 
forum 
for 
stakeholders 
to 
formulate 
respective 
implementation 
strategies, 
was 
held 
in 
March 
2001. 
As 
part 
of 
the 
PRSCl 
program, 
the 
government prepared recommendations 
for 
the 
legal, 
regulatory, 
and 
supervisory 
framework 
for 
microfinance, 
consistent 
with 
the 
national microfinance 
policy 
and, 
based 
on 
recommendations, 
prepared 
corresponding 
legislation that 
has 
been 
passed 
by 
parliament. 
Enforcement 
of 
this 
legislation 
is 
an 
indicative 
PRSC2 action. 
108. 
Improve 
land tenure 
security: 
Enactment 
of 
the 
Land 
Act 
and 
Village 
Land 
Act 
in 
1999 
was 
a 
positive 
step 
toward 
solving land 
tenure 
issues 
in 
Tanzania. 
The 
acts 
create 
avenues 
to 
resolve 
problems 
related 
to 
tenure 
insecurity, 
particularly 
for 
women, 
by 
providing 
a 
legal 
basis 
for 
regularizing land 
tenure 
under 
customary 
tenure 
regimes 
and 
providing for 
decentralized 
land 
administration 
and 
conflict 
resolution. 
This 
will 
be 
particularly important 
in 
areas 
with 
rising 
population 
pressure 
and 
agricultural 
commercialization. 
The 
centerpiece 
of 
the 
laws 
is 
the 
devolution 
of 
authority 
and 
administration 
over 
land 
to 
the 
village 
councils. 
The 
councils 
are 
now 
responsible 
for 
guiding 
community 
decisions 
on 
the 
distribution 
of 
land 
within 
the 
village 
into 
household, clan, 
community, 
and other 
lands, 
as 
well 
as 
their 
adjudication, 
registration (village 
land 
register), 
and 
titling 
(to 
be 
effected 
by 
the 
office 
of 
the 
commissioner 
for 
lands 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
decisions 
of 
the village). 
Since 
the 
enactment 
of 
the 
Land 
Act 
in 
1999, 
implementation 
has 
been 
slow. 
Under 
the 
PRSC program, focus 
is 
given 
to 
accelerating 
implementation 
progress 
. 
As 
such, 
the 
policy 
actions 
under 
the 
PRSC 
policy  matrix 
include 
the 
development 
of 
a 
38 
Page  49
prioritized 
strategic 
plan 
for 
implementation 
of 
the 
acts. 
However, 
full 
(country-wide) 
implementation 
of 
the 
acts 
in 
the 
next 
few 
years 
will 
likely 
be 
unaffordable 
and 
constrained 
by 
limited 
capacity. 
The 
strategic 
plan 
should 
prioritize 
initial 
implementation 
to 
areas 
where 
the 
impact 
is 
likely to 
be 
greatest. 
Based 
on 
the 
plan, 
a 
program 
to 
strengthen 
capacity 
for 
implementation, 
at 
both 
the 
national 
and 
local 
levels, 
should 
be developed. 
Both 
of 
these 
items 
are 
included 
under 
indicative 
PRSC2 actions. 
The 
implementation 
of 
the 
prioritized 
plan 
is 
to 
begin over 
the 
medium 
term 
(tentative PRSC3 action). 
1 
09. 
Strengthen 
the 
institutional 
arrangements 
for 
district 
road 
maintenance 
and 
rehabilitation: 
Improved 
market 
access 
is 
essential 
for 
the 
transformation 
of 
subsistence 
agriculture 
into 
commercial 
agriculture. Distance 
to 
markets remains 
large, 
and transaction 
costs 
are 
a 
large 
share 
of 
the 
cost 
of 
agricultural 
marketing. 
For 
example, a 
1999 
commodity marketing 
study 
concluded that 
approximately 
40 
percent 
of 
the cost 
of 
grains 
in 
the 
major 
urban 
markets 
is 
attributed 
to 
transportation 
costs. 
Only 
8 
percent 
of 
the 
districts’ 
road 
network 
are 
in 
good 
condition. 
Sixty 
percent 
of 
the 
district 
and 
feeder 
road network 
are 
impassable 
to 
vehicles 
throughout the 
year, 
increasing 
to 
90 
percent 
during 
the 
rainy 
season. 
Improved 
rural 
roads 
would 
raise 
the 
producer’s 
share 
of 
the 
export 
crop 
price,  reduce 
the 
farm-level 
cost 
of 
inputs, 
and 
reduce 
spatial 
marketing 
margins 
in 
food 
marketing. Implementation 
arrangement 
for 
maintaining 
and 
developing 
rural 
roads remains weak. 
In 
most districts, 
the 
capacity 
to 
plan,  organize, 
and 
manage 
road 
maintenance 
work 
is 
lacking, 
and 
coordination 
among 
the 
national, 
regional, 
and 
district 
engineers 
is 
weak. 
Improving 
the 
network 
of 
district 
and 
feeder roads 
would 
require 
a 
substantial 
increase 
in 
recurrent 
and 
investment 
expenditure,  and 
the 
use 
and  accounting 
of 
existing 
funds 
need 
to 
be 
improved, 
as 
highlighted 
in 
the 
recent  annual 
audit 
of 
road 
funds 
resources 
going to local 
levels. 
The 
PRSC 
policy matrix 
calls 
for 
institutional 
strengthening 
by 
development 
of 
proposals 
to 
strengthen 
the 
institutional 
arrangements 
for 
district  road 
maintenance and 
rehabilitation 
(an 
indicative 
PRSC2 
action), 
followed 
the 
next 
year 
(tentative 
PRSC3 
action) 
by 
beginning 
implementation 
of 
a 
program 
to 
strengthen 
institutional 
arrangements 
for 
district 
road 
maintenance and 
rehabilitation. 
B. 
MONITORING 
THE IMPLEMENTATION 
OF 
THE 
PRS 
110. 
An 
important 
feature 
of 
the 
Tanzania 
PRS 
is 
that 
it 
constitutes  a 
rolling, 
three-year 
framework 
for 
implementation 
of 
policies 
and 
measures 
to 
alleviate 
poverty 
in 
a 
manner that 
is 
both 
participatory 
and outcome 
oriented. 
This 
practical 
approach 
to 
ensuring 
that 
the 
PRS 
is 
a 
living 
document 
enables 
the 
PRS 
goals 
and 
implementation 
arrangements 
to 
be 
calibrated 
flexibly 
in 
the 
light 
of 
experience. 
It 
is 
therefore 
vital 
that 
implementation 
of 
the 
PRS 
is 
monitored 
adequately, 
and 
the 
results  should 
be 
evaluated 
effectively 
for 
further 
strengthening 
of 
the 
process. 
11 
1. 
The 
medium-term 
outcome 
being 
sought 
is 
enhanced 
accountability 
for 
delivery 
on 
the 
PRS 
via 
coordinated and 
streamlined 
monitoring 
processes 
across 
the 
GOT. 
An 
integral 
element 
of 
PRSC support 
thus 
will 
be 
linked 
to 
enhanced 
monitoring 
of 
progress 
toward 
the 
attainment 
of 
the 
PRS objectives. 
M&E 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
PRSC 
builds 
on 
a 
number 
of 
processes 
that 
are 
already 
in 
place 
or 
being 
developed 
to 
monitor 
and evaluate progress 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
PRS. 
Briefly, 
the 
current 
status 
of 
the 
system 
for 
poverty monitoring 
and 
analysis 
in 
Tanzania 
is 
as 
follows:

A 
sound 
policy 
framework 
for 
poverty reduction 
is 
in 
place. 
The 
PRS process 
is 
demonstrating that 
it 
is 
an 
effective 
way to 
identify 
priority 
actions 
to 
reduce 
poverty. 
The 
GOT 
has 
prepared 
the 
second PRS 
progress 
report.

Tanzania 
is 
now 
in 
the 
process 
of 
integrating 
the 
MDGs 
and 
monitoring 
their 
progress 
in 
the 
PRS 
process. Tanzania 
produced 
a 
first 
report 
on 
progress 
toward 
the 
MDGs 
in 
2001 
and 
a 
report 
on 
costing 
the 
achievements 
of 
the 
MDGs 
in 
2002. 
This report 
also 
indicated 
the 
likelihood 
of 
achieving 
the 
targets 
for 
Tanzania. 
A 
report 
on 
progress 
toward 
achievement 
of 
the 
MDGs 
in 
Zanzibar 
is 
currently 
under 
way. 
A 
poverty 
monitoring 
master 
plan 
has 
been 
agreed 
to 
by 
stakeholders 
and 
published 
and 
distributed 
in 
Kiswahili 
and 
English 
versions. 
The 
master 
plan 
provides 
a 
comprehensive 
system 
for 
monitoring 
the 
various 
dimensions 
of 
poverty reduction 
and 
economic 
growth, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
various 
elements 
of 
the 
PRS. 
The 
institutional 
arrangements 
for 
a 
poverty 
monitoring 
system 
have 
been agreed 
upon, 
comprising 
four 
technical 
working 
groups 
and 
a 
national 
committee. 
The 
technical 
working 
groups 
are 
concerned 
with 
surveys 
and 
censuses, 
routine 
data 
systems, 
research 
and 
analysis, 
and 
dissemination, sensitization, 
and 
advocacy. The 
institutional 
framework 
for 
poverty 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
is 
under the 
oversight 
of 
the 
Vice 
President’s 
Office 
and 
also 
overseen 
technically by 
a 
National 
Poverty 
Monitoring 
Steering Committee. 
There 
was 
an 
impressive 
set 
of 
key 
outputs 
of 
the 
poverty 
monitoring 
system 
during 
2002. 
These are 
the 
HBS, 
PHDR, 
National 
Participatory Poverty 
Assessment, and 
the 
conduct 
of 
the 
poverty 
policy 
week. 
The 
timing 
of 
PRS 
reviews 
has 
been 
adjusted 
for 
optimal 
link 
to 
budgeting 
and 
consultative 
group 
processes. 
Discussions 
on 
the 
links 
with 
the 
public 
expenditure 
review 
process have begun.

Hence, 
the 
mainstreaming 
and 
strengthening 
of 
a 
poverty 
monitoring 
and 
analysis 
process 
builds 
on 
a 
poverty 
monitoring 
system 
recently 
developed 
by 
the 
GOT 
and 
a 
well-established 
annual 
public 
expenditure 
review-medium-term 
expenditure 
framework 
mechanism. 
These 
are 
deemed 
to 
be 
key 
building 
blocks 
in 
the 
effort 
to 
foster 
and 
strengthen 
open 
and 
transparent 
arrangements 
for monitoring 
outcomes.

Figure 
5 
provides an overview 
of 
the 
monitoring 
system, 
which 
covers outcome, output, 
process, 
and 
input 
indicators. 
This 
system 
comprises 
three 
interrelated 
tiers. 
The 
poverty 
monitoring 
system 
focuses 
on 
the 
measurement 
of 
impact, 
outcomes, 
and 
proxy 
indicators. 
Sector 
programs, such 
as 
those 
for 
education 
and health, focus 
on 
the 
tracking 
of 
output indicators 
with 
adequate 
monitoring 
mechanisms 
in 
place. 
The 
PER-MTEF 
processes 
focus 
on 
inputs, 
with 
an 
emphasis 
on 
budget 
allocation 
and 
budget execution. 
114. 
In 
the context 
of 
the 
PRSC 
and 
the 
PRS, 
outcome,  output, 
and 
input 
indicators 
provide 
direct 
information 
on 
the 
status 
of 
poverty 
in 
all 
its 
dimensions. 
Monitoring 
of 
these 
indicators 
is 
based 
on 
a 
broad 
range 
of 
surveys 
and administrative 
data 
systems 
identified 
in 
the 
poverty 
reduction 
master 
plan. 
The 
PHDR 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
produced 
annually, 
consolidate 
poverty 
measures 
from 
various 
sources, 
and 
provide 
analysis 
of 
poverty 
trends 
and 
underlying 
factors. 
(Annex 
12 
shows 
the 
agreed 
outline 
of 
the 
PHDR.) 
As 
noted, 
preliminary 
work 
on PSIA 
has 
been 
carried 
out 
to 
underpin 
the 
PHDR. Additionally, 
in 
fiscal 
2004, 
the 
GOT 
will 
undertake a 
poverty 
and 
social 
impact 
assessment 
and 
a 
poverty vulnerability 
study 
to 
strengthen 
analyses 
carried out 
41 
Page  52
so 
far 
and 
establish  a  stronger  baseline 
for 
future 
monitoring. 
A 
poverty 
policy 
week 
(a 
consultative 
workshop) 
was hosted 
by 
the 
poverty 
eradication 
division 
of 
the 
Vice 
President’s 
Office 
(VPO) 
in 
September 2002. 
The 
poverty 
policy 
week 
is 
planned 
to 
be 
an 
annual 
event, 
and 
it 
will 
focus 
on 
reviewing 
progress 
in 
achieving 
poverty 
reduction 
and 
growth 
targets 
as 
enunciated 
in 
the 
PRS. Sector 
development 
reviews 
will 
be 
the 
key 
monitoring 
mechanisms 
for 
outputs 
at  the 
sectoral 
level, 
and 
the 
PRGF 
reviews 
and 
the 
quarterly 
macrofinancial 
developments 
report 
will 
be 
the 
key 
sources 
for 
the 
assessment 
of 
the 
macroeconomic situation. 
Progress 
in 
public 
expenditure 
management 
covering 
both 
improvements 
in 
systems 
and 
enhanced 
allocative 
and operational 
efficiency 
in 
the 
use 
of 
inputs 
will 
be 
tracked 
by 
the 
annual 
PERs. 
1 1 
5. 
An 
additional 
dimension 
of 
the 
monitoring 
framework 
covers 
the  government-donor 
relationship 
in 
monitoring 
progress 
on 
PRSC objectives,  such 
as 
enhanced 
local 
ownership 
of 
the 
development 
process, 
participation 
by 
all 
stakeholders, 
and 
efficiency 
of 
aid 
delivery 
mechanisms. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
this 
dimension  can 
be 
reviewed 
via 
an  annual 
report 
of 
the 
findings 
of 
the 
independent 
monitoring 
groupg 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
TAS. 
Additionally, 
the 
annual 
Consultative Group 
meetings 
provide 
a 
mechanism 
for 
a broad-based 
review 
of 
the 
PRS 
and 
its 
progress report, 
as 
well 
as 
a 
consideration 
of 
the 
way 
forward 
as 
presented 
in 
the 
related 
action 
plan 
by 
the 
donor 
community 
(locally 
based 
and 
headquarters’ 
donor 
representatives). 
In 
addition, 
the 
Consultative 
Group 
also 
serves 
as 
a 
forum 
for 
discussing 
vital 
cross-cutting 
issues 
in 
areas 
such 
as 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
governance. 
The 
informal, 
two-day 
sessions 
preceding 
the 
Consultative Group 
meetings 
permit 
the 
active 
participation 
of 
civil 
society, 
the 
private 
sector, academia, 
and 
the 
media 
in 
the 
review 
of 
the 
PRS. 
Annex 
13 
provides 
an 
overview 
of 
the 
M&E 
mechanism that 
will 
provide 
the basis 
for monitoring 
the 
areas 
covered 
by 
the 
PRSC. 
It 
also 
describes 
to 
what 
extent 
the 
various 
monitoring 
mechanisms are 
participatory. 
Although 
these processes 
match 
the 
proposed 
focus 
of 
the 
first 
set 
of 
PRSC 
interventions, 
it 
will 
also 
be 
important 
to 
put 
in 
place 
monitoring 
systems 
and 
baseline evaluations 
to 
support 
the 
proposed 
thematic 
expansion 
of 
the 
PRSC 
over 
the 
medium 
term-in 
particular, 
to 
capture 
important 
areas 
such 
as 
environmental 
sustainability. 
116. 
Prior 
actions 
for PRSCl 
in 
this 
area 
that  have 
been 
completed 
are: 
(1) 
publication 
of 
a 
stakeholder-reviewed  PRS 
progress 
report 
for 
2001-02 
and 
the 
PHDR, 
including 
HBS 
and 
integrated labor force 
survey 
(ILFS) 
findings; 
and 
(2) 
presentation 
of 
the 
second 
annual PRS 
progress 
report 
for 
fiscal 
2002, 
satisfactory 
to 
IDA 
and other  stakeholders. 
Under 
the  PRSC 
program, 
as 
noted, 
emphasis 
has 
been 
placed 
on 
measuring 
results 
from 
implementation 
of 
sectoral and 
multisectoral 
programs. 
The 
annual 
PRS 
progress 
report 
is 
the 
main 
framework 
for 
progress 
in 
improving 
social welfare and human capabilities and 
is 
assessed 
by 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
stakeholders. 
This 
work 
is 
aimed 
at 
mainstreaming results 
orientation 
in 
the 
annual sector 
reviews 
and 
gauging 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
feedback 
to policy 
and 
program 
design 
learning 
from 
the 
annual 
PRS 
review 
processes. 
Outstanding 
Issues and 
Next 
Steps 
117. 
The 
2002 
(annual) 
PRJ3S 
review 
provides 
a 
positive 
overall 
assessment 
of 
the 
poverty 
M&E 
system. 
However, 
looking 
ahead, 
the 
key 
outstanding 
and  actionable 
areas 
to 
further 
strengthen 
this 
process can 
be 
clustered 
around 
three 
broad 
themes: 
The 
independent 
monitoring 
group 
was 
established 
in 
the 
mid-1990s 
to 
monitor 
the 
relationship 
between 
government 
and 
donors 
building 
on 
the 
findings 
of 
the 
Helleiner 
report. 
42 
Page  53
118. 
First, 
there 
is 
a 
need 
to 
strengthen 
the 
linkages 
among 
cross-cutting 
and 
sectoral 
policies 
and 
programs,  budgets,  and 
poverty 
monitoring  to 
enhance 
the  cogency  among  policies, 
expenditures, 
and 
delivery 
of 
services. 
In 
this 
respect, 
although 
progress 
has 
been 
made 
in 
the 
PHDR’s 
analysis 
of 
macroeconomic 
policy 
linkages 
and 
poverty 
and 
work 
on 
linking 
poverty 
monitoring 
and 
public 
expenditure 
has 
begun, 
there 
is 
a 
need 
for 
closer 
linkages 
between 
policy 
formulation 
and actual 
information 
on 
poverty. 
119. 
Efforts 
are 
being 
made 
to 
link 
and 
harmonize 
the 
timing 
of 
poverty 
reviews 
with 
the 
budgeting 
process, 
PER 
process, 
and 
PRSC 
and 
PRBS 
reviews. 
By 
the 
same 
token, 
further efforts 
to 
synchronize 
and 
link 
sector 
reviews 
are 
now 
quite 
urgent, 
with 
due 
attention 
to 
quality 
issues. 
The 
linkage 
of 
routine 
data 
from 
local 
government and 
priority 
sector 
ministries 
with 
the 
national 
poverty 
monitoring 
system 
needs 
strengthening. 
120. 
The 
second 
set 
of 
actions 
involves 
firmly 
integrating 
the 
monitoring 
of 
progress 
toward 
the 
MDGs 
into 
the 
PRS 
context 
and 
developing robust 
proxy 
indicators 
for 
the 
future. 
The 
process 
will 
require completion 
of 
the 
analytical 
work 
on 
the 
eight 
MDGs 
and 
the 
corresponding 
list 
of 
indicators. 
Agreeing 
on 
a 
revised 
set 
of 
indicators 
for 
the 
PRS 
and 
strengthening 
indicator 
work 
where 
required, 
including 
development 
of 
specific 
annual and 
periodic quantitative 
indicators, 
is 
needed. 
121. 
Finally, 
addressing 
the 
capacity 
gaps 
and 
needs 
as 
well 
as 
incentive 
issues 
at 
various 
levels 
will 
be 
key, and 
it 
is 
central 
to 
the 
PRSC 
policy 
matrix. 
With 
respect 
to 
routine 
data 
for 
poverty 
monitoring, 
capacity 
building 
is 
needed 
at 
the central 
(VPO 
secretariat)  and 
local 
government 
levels 
(including regional 
secretariats 
and 
President’s 
Office 
- 
Regional Administrations 
and 
Local 
Authorities) 
and 
priority 
sector 
ministries. 
Also, 
strengthening 
of 
the 
Tanzania 
socioeconomic 
database 
as 
the 
repository 
of 
key 
quantitative 
data 
for 
poverty 
analysis 
is 
required. 
Ensuring 
that 
the 
funding 
mechanism 
for 
the 
poverty 
monitoring 
system  becomes 
fully 
operational 
is 
also 
critical. 
122. 
In 
the 
context 
of 
the 
PRSC 
policy 
matrix, 
the 
focus 
will 
be 
on 
the 
annual 
issuance 
of 
a 
stakeholder-reviewed  PRS 
progress 
report 
and 
the 
related 
PHDR, 
including 
HBS 
and 
ILFS 
findings 
for 
the 
first 
year 
of 
the 
three-year 
PRSC 
cycle. 
Additionally, 
a 
positive review 
of 
PRS 
progress 
(including 
with 
reference 
to 
sector 
reviews 
and 
achievement 
of 
quantitative 
targets 
[see 
annex 
71 
in 
the 
second 
and 
third 
years) 
will 
be 
required. 
123. 
The 
next 
set 
of 
actions 
concerns 
institutional 
strengthening 
via 
boosting the 
capacity 
of 
the 
coordination 
and 
monitoring 
unit 
in 
PO-RALG 
for 
collecting, 
collating, 
and 
analyzing 
administrative 
data, 
as 
well 
as 
strengthening 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
technical 
secretariat 
in 
the 
VPO 
to 
support 
and 
monitor 
implementation 
of 
the 
PRS. 
The 
PRSC’s 
medium-term  program 
of 
support 
seeks 
to 
ensure  adequate 
staffing 
and 
resources 
in 
the 
fiscal 
2005 
budget 
for 
implementing 
the 
capacity-building 
measures. 
Another 
vital 
area 
relates 
to 
the 
integration 
of 
the 
monitoring 
of 
progress 
toward 
the contextualized 
MDG 
targets 
(as 
discussed above) 
within 
this 
institutional 
framework. 
The 
MDGs 
offer 
a  comprehensive 
framework 
to 
address 
poverty 
reduction 
objectives 
through 
goals 
that 
address 
the 
multidimensionality 
of 
poverty. 
124. 
The 
government 
is 
in 
the 
process 
of 
integrating 
the 
MDGs 
and 
monitoring 
progress 
toward 
their 
achievement 
into 
the 
PRS process. 
The 
2001-02  PRS 
progress 
report 
notes 
two 
important 
reasons 
for 
doing 
so: 
(1) 
The 
MDGs 
have 
a 
more 
distant 
time 
horizon 
than 
the 
PRS. 
Integrating 
the 
MDGs 
into 
the 
PRS 
process 
will 
facilitate 
coherence 
between 
short- 
and 
long-term poverty 
reduction 
targets. 
(2) 
This 
will 
avoid 
the 
proliferation 
of 
monitoring 
processes. 
Initial 
work 
on 
this 
is 
under 
way: 
Consultants engaged 
by 
the 
government 
are 
doing 
comparative 
work 
on 
the 
43 
Page  54
MDGs 
and 
the 
national 
policy 
framework, 
including 
the 
various 
elements 
of 
the 
poverty 
monitoring 
system, 
for 
example, 
the 
PRS and 
the 
Zanzibar 
poverty 
reduction 
plan 
The 
draft 
report 
will 
be 
available 
soon 
and 
will 
highlight 
the 
discrepancies  and discuss 
the 
process 
for 
integration 
of 
the 
MDGs. 
The 
PRSC 
process 
will 
support 
efforts 
by 
the 
government 
and 
development partners 
in 
this 
regard. 
That 
said, 
as 
things 
stand at present, 
there 
is 
a 
fair 
amount 
of 
synchronization 
between 
the 
MDGs 
and 
the 
PRS. 
The 
government 
is 
also 
in 
the 
process 
of 
reviewing 
and 
establishing 
medium-term 
(through 
2006) PRS targets 
in 
an exercise 
to 
update 
the 
2003 
PRS 
targets. 
125. 
With 
a 
view 
to 
strengthening 
the 
focus 
of 
the 
PRS 
review 
process and 
clarifying 
the 
linkages 
with 
the 
PRSC, 
the 
poverty 
eradication 
division 
in 
the 
VPO 
has 
been 
coordinating 
work 
on 
finalizing 
the 
selection 
of 
a core 
set 
of 
quantitative indicators 
for 
performance 
assessment 
to 
monitor 
broad-ranging 
achievements 
and 
trends 
in 
terms 
of 
poverty 
levels, 
social well-being,  and 
environmental 
sustainability. 
This 
select 
set 
of 
annual 
and 
intermittent 
indicators" 
(annex 
7) 
has 
been 
collated 
in 
the 
context 
of 
a 
process 
under 
the 
VPO 
by 
an 
ad hoc  indicator 
taskforce 
(comprising 
sectoral 
representatives and 
experts 
and development 
partners, 
including 
the 
World 
Bank). 
This 
set 
of 
indicators 
was  discussed 
among 
key 
stakeholders, 
including 
the 
poverty 
monitoring 
secretariat, 
poverty 
monitoring 
technical 
working 
groups, PRS 
technical 
committee, 
poverty 
monitoring 
steering committee, 
raw 
data 
working 
group,  sector 
working 
groups, 
PRBS 
stakeholders, 
and PRSC 
stakeholders. 
In 
this 
regard, 
it 
is 
noteworthy 
that 
sectoral 
issues 
will 
continue 
to 
be 
implemented 
and 
monitored 
under 
the 
specific 
sector 
programs. 
126. 
At 
a broader, aggregate level, 
the 
accountability 
for 
effective 
use 
of 
resources 
availed 
to 
sectors 
and the 
attendant  outcomes and impacts 
of 
these 
programs 
on 
the 
quality 
of 
services 
delivered-and, 
more 
broadly, 
the 
improvements 
in 
the 
livelihood 
and 
social 
well-being 
of 
Tanzanians-will 
be 
a 
part 
of 
the 
PRSC  mechanism. 
The 
purpose 
of 
selecting 
this 
list 
of 
indicators 
is 
not,  at least at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
process, 
to 
provide 
an exhaustive 
judgment 
on 
their 
performance  and 
impact 
on 
poverty 
of 
each 
sector 
in 
Tanzania, 
but 
rather 
to 
provide 
an 
indication 
of 
broader  performance 
trends. 
The 
initial 
phase 
of 
the 
process 
will 
thus 
seek 
to 
provide 
an  aggregative 
assessment 
of 
whether 
the 
performance 
in 
the 
various 
key 
sectors 
is 
contributing 
toward 
the 
broader 
objectives 
of 
the PRS process. 
Annual 
and 
intermittent 
indicators 
in 
the 
following 
specific 
sectors, 
broad 
or 
thematic and cross-cutting 
areas, 
have been selected 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
their 
relevance 
to 
the 
Tanzania 
PRS 
progress 
report: 
income 
poverty, 
rural 
roads, 
agriculture, 
human 
capabilities 
(primary 
education), 
human 
capabilities (health 
and 
HIV/AIDS), 
human 
capabilities 
(water and sanitation), 
survival, 
nutrition, 
governance, 
poverty-environment 
linkages, 
gender, 
and 
extreme 
vulnerability. 
Io 
Baseline 
data 
(2000), 
drawn largely 
from 
the 
PHDR, 
are 
provided for 
the 
various indicators. 
44 
Page  55
127. 
It 
is 
noteworthy 
that 
a 
number 
of 
indicators relevant 
to 
cross-cutting and broader 
areas- 
for 
example, 
gender, 
health, 
or 
poverty-environment 
linkages-are 
also 
available under 
some 
of 
the 
other 
categories, 
that 
is, 
water 
and  sanitation, 
extreme 
vulnerability, 
and 
so 
forth. 
Additionally, 
after 
discussions, 
criteria 
for 
arriving 
at 
the 
core 
set 
of 
indicators were 
established 
by 
the 
taskforce: 
(a) 
a 
clear 
link 
to 
the 
PRS, 
(b) 
meaningfulness 
or 
relevance 
to 
poverty, 
(c) 
standard 
definitions 
(across 
different 
surveys 
and 
so 
on), 
(d) 
data 
availability, 
(e) 
available 
baseline, 
(f) 
reasonable 
quality 
of 
data,  (8) 
no 
extra 
cost 
incurred 
in 
the 
data 
collection 
and 
monitoring 
effort, 
(h) 
mix 
of 
indicator 
levels 
as 
appropriate (input-output, 
outcome-impact), 
(i) 
frequency 
of 
data 
collection 
with 
a 
view 
to 
analyzing 
trends, 
(j) 
disaggregation 
to 
the appropriate 
levels (rural 
or 
urban, 
gender), 
and 
(k) 
limited 
number 
of 
key 
indicators. 
Although 
the 
choice 
of 
indicators 
in 
some 
areas 
was 
fairly 
straightforward 
and 
a 
good 
degree 
of 
consensus 
was 
reached, 
this 
was 
not 
the 
case 
for 
all 
areas. 
Further 
work 
is 
planned 
to 
refine 
the 
indicators 
with 
respect 
to 
poverty-environment 
linkages, 
vulnerability, 
governance, roads 
(particularly 
in 
the 
rural 
context), 
and agriculture. 
128. 
In 
line 
with 
the 
proposed 
alignment 
of 
PRSC support 
with 
the 
multidonor 
PRBS” 
(see 
section 
1V.C 
on 
alignment 
with 
the 
PRBS), 
the 
Bank 
agreed 
on 
a 
joint 
M&E 
mechanism 
that 
would 
cover 
both 
the 
PRSC  and 
PRBS 
and 
minimize 
overlap  and any 
additional burden 
on 
government and 
local 
institutions. 
Hence, 
a 
key 
area 
where 
agreement 
has 
been reached relates 
to 
establishing 
a 
harmonized 
annual 
review 
cycle 
for 
the 
PRBS-PRSC 
matrix. 
Use 
of 
M&E 
Results 
to 
Sharpen the 
Focus 
of 
the 
PRS 
and 
PRSC 
129. 
The information 
provided through 
the 
various 
monitoring 
processes 
serves 
to 
enhance 
the 
accountability 
for 
results 
by 
the 
responsible 
actor. 
In 
addition, 
that 
information 
is 
also 
used 
to 
inform 
the 
revisions 
to 
the 
PRSP 
within 
the 
rolling 
annual 
framework 
adopted 
by 
Tanzania, 
where 
each 
annual 
progress 
report 
also 
includes 
updates and 
revisions 
of 
the 
PRS 
in 
light 
of 
new 
information. 
This 
in 
turn 
will 
serve 
to 
update 
and 
fine-tune 
the 
focus 
of 
the 
PAF 
for 
subsequent 
PRSCs 
in 
line 
with 
revisions 
to 
the 
PRS. 
C. 
SUSTAINING 
MACROECONOMIC 
STABILITY 
130. 
Since 
the 
mid-l990s, 
Tanzania 
has 
made 
substantial 
progress 
in 
macroeconomic 
stabilization, 
structural 
and 
social 
reforms,  and 
the 
removal 
of 
key 
distortions 
in 
the 
economy. 
The 
macroeconomic  performance  remained  strong 
under 
the 
PRGF- 
and 
PSAC 
1 
-supported 
structural reforms 
programs. 
Recognizing 
that sustaining macroeconomic 
stability 
is 
imperative 
for 
higher 
growth 
and 
poverty 
reduction, 
the 
PRSC 
policy matrix 
places considerable emphasis 
on 
the 
second 
generation 
of 
reforms. 
In 
particular,  attention 
is 
devoted 
to 
two main 
areas 
of 
concern, 
which 
are 
discussed 
below. 
The 
PRBS 
framework includes 
10 
key bilateral 
donors 
and 
the 
European Commission.

Maintaining 
Prudent  Fiscal 
and 
Monetary 
Policies 
and 
Ensuring  Prudential  Debt 
Contracting 
and 
ManagementI2 
13 
1. 
Tanzania’s 
public 
and 
publicly 
guaranteed 
external 
debt 
is 
assessed 
as 
being 
currently 
sustainable 
after 
obtaining 
irrevocable 
debt 
relief 
under 
the 
enhanced 
HIPC 
Initiative 
(amounting 
to 
US$ 
3 
billion). 
Continued sustainability 
of 
Tanzania’s 
external 
debt 
is 
contingent 
on 
the 
sustained 
implementation 
of 
macroeconomic 
and 
structural 
reform 
policies, 
as 
well 
as 
prudent 
management 
of 
external 
debt. 
Recently, 
Tanzania’s 
debt 
management has 
been 
strengthened 
through 
the 
adoption 
of 
a 
national 
debt strategy. 
As 
a 
prior 
action 
for 
the 
PRSC 
1, 
the government 
amended 
and 
presented 
for 
parliamentary  approval 
the 
Loans, 
Guarantees, 
and 
Grants 
Act 
Number 
30 
of 
1974 
to 
ensure 
a 
prudential 
debt 
contracting 
and 
management 
system 
for 
government and 
public 
independent 
institutions. 
132. 
The 
actions  envisaged 
under 
the 
two 
follow-on 
PRSCs 
include 
the 
presentation 
for 
parliamentary approval 
of 
the 
amended Treasury  Registrar’s 
Ordinance 
(1 
959) 
and other 
laws 
that relate 
to 
the 
procurement 
of 
debt. 
A 
comprehensive 
review 
will 
be 
conducted 
of 
all 
laws 
that 
relate 
to 
the 
procurement 
of 
debt 
to 
ensure 
consistency 
with 
the 
provisions 
of, 
and 
elimination 
of 
loopholes  concerning 
the 
enforcement 
of, 
the 
amended  Loans,  Guarantees  and 
Grants 
Act 
Number 
30 
of 
1974. 
The 
finalization, 
approval,  and 
implementation 
of 
a 
work 
plan 
for 
the 
execution 
of 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
National 
Debt 
Strategy 
are 
planned. 
Additionally, 
annual 
debt 
(domestic  and external) 
sustainability 
analyses 
for 
the periods 
ending 
in 
June 
2002 
and 
June 2003 
will 
be 
carried 
out. 
The 
preparation 
of 
an 
annual 
borrowing 
and repayment 
plan 
(concessional 
and  nonconcessional 
loans  and 
attention 
to 
limits), 
presentation 
of 
this 
to 
parliament 
as 
part 
of 
the 
annual 
budget, 
and 
the 
development 
of 
a 
complete 
inventory 
of-and 
a 
verification 
and 
audit 
of-the 
contingent 
liability 
component 
of 
domestic 
debt 
are also intended. 
Strengthened 
Tax 
Policy 
and 
Tax 
Administration 
133. 
Tanzania 
has 
a 
comparatively 
low 
revenue 
effort, 
which 
makes 
it 
necessary 
for 
the 
government 
to 
strive 
to 
improve 
domestic revenue 
collection, 
particularly 
through broadening 
the 
tax 
base 
and enhancing 
efficiency 
in 
tax 
administration. 
It 
is 
in 
this 
spirit 
that 
the 
government 
removed 
government exemptions 
on 
value 
added 
tax 
(VAT) 
and 
import 
duties 
in 
the 
2001/02 and 
2002/03 
budgets, 
respectively. 
A 
“large  taxpayers”  department 
has 
also been established 
in 
the 
Tanzania 
Revenue 
Authority 
(TRA) 
as 
a 
measure 
to 
improve 
customer service. 
Analytic 
work 
has 
been 
undertaken 
to 
assess 
the 
adequacy 
of 
the 
TRA’s 
tax administration 
system. 
In 
line 
with 
the 
PRS 
planned action 
to 
review 
tax 
laws 
and 
remaining 
exemptions, 
the 
PRSC 
policy 
matrix 
proposes 
the 
following main 
actions 
over  the 
next 
two 
annual 
cycles:  a 
review 
of 
the 
tax 
exemptions 
regime 
for 
investment 
or 
relating 
to 
imports 
under 
donor 
programs, 
as 
well 
as 
those 
in 
the 
export 
processing 
zones 
legislation, 
to 
close 
loopholes, 
to 
be 
followed 
by 
the 
implementation 
of 
the  recommendations 
stemming 
from 
the 
review. 
The 
other 
set 
of 
actions 
relates 
to 
development 
and 
approval 
of 
the 
TRA’s 
new 
corporate 
plan, 
including 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
medium-term 
strategy 
for 
tax 
administration. 
134. 
Streamlining 
local 
government 
taxes 
and 
levies: 
To 
address 
the 
high 
compliance 
and 
administrative 
costs 
and 
other 
inefficiencies arising 
from 
the 
proliferation 
of 
local 
government 
taxes 
and 
levies, 
the 
PRSC 
policy 
matrix 
identifies 
measures 
aimed 
at 
simplifying 
and 
The 
government 
completed 
an 
inventory 
of 
and 
cleared 
all 
domestic 
debt arrears 
outstanding 
as 
of 
December 
2000. 
The 
HIPC 
completion 
point 
conditions 
were also 
met, 
enabling 
the 
country to 
reach 
the 
completion 
point 
in 
November 
2001. 
A national 
debt 
strategy 
was 
also 
approved 
by 
the 
government 
in 
August 
2002.

rationalizing 
local 
government taxation. 
A 
strategy 
for 
harmonization 
and 
rationalization 
of 
local 
government 
taxes 
and 
levies 
has 
been developed 
by 
Government 
and 
relevant  guidelines have 
been 
issued 
to 
local 
authorities 
in 
the 
context 
of 
PRSC1. 
A 
PRSC2 
indicative  action 
is 
to 
implement 
selected 
options 
for 
harmonization 
and 
rationalization 
of 
local 
government 
taxes and 
levies, 
including 
a 
unified 
tax 
collection 
system 
for 
agriculture 
exports. 
The 
government 
intends 
to 
undertake 
a 
thorough 
review 
of 
local 
government 
taxes 
and levies 
as 
a 
prelude 
to 
a 
more 
comprehensive 
harmonization 
and 
rationalization 
of 
the 
same, 
and 
devise 
a 
simpler  and 
more 
efficient 
local 
government 
revenue  structure, 
including 
a 
unified 
tax 
collection 
system 
for 
agriculture 
exports. 
This 
work 
is 
to 
be 
undertaken 
in 
the 
context 
of 
PRSC3.

IMPROVING 
THE 
EFFECTIVENESS 
OF 
DELIVERY 
OF 
PUBLIC 
SERVICES 
AND 
OVERALL 
INCENTIVE 
ENVIRONMENT 
Public Expenditure Management 
and 
Improved 
Service 
Delivery 
135. 
The 
PSACl 
framework 
had 
a 
clear 
focus 
on 
actions 
to 
improve 
public 
expenditure 
allocation and 
management. 
Reforms initiated 
under 
PSACl 
will 
be 
continued 
under 
PRSC1, 
and 
the 
operation 
supports 
reorienting 
the 
strategic 
allocation 
of 
public 
spending 
to 
meet 
PRS 
targets, 
improved 
public 
financial 
management and procurement, 
cost-effective 
public 
service 
delivery, 
and 
implementation 
of 
anticorruption 
programs. 
136. 
As 
noted, 
considerable 
progress 
has 
been 
made 
in 
improving  public 
expenditure 
management 
in 
Tanzania 
since 
the 
introduction 
of 
cash 
budgeting 
in 
1996/97 
and 
the 
adoption 
of 
a 
participatory 
PER-MTEF 
approach 
to 
monitor, 
inform, 
and 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
government 
expenditures. 
Over 
the 
last 
few 
years, 
reasonable progress 
has 
been 
made 
in 
enhancing 
funding 
for 
key 
activities 
in 
the 
priority 
sectors. 
Progress 
has 
also been made 
in 
bringing 
a 
greater 
portion 
of 
donor 
support 
into 
the 
budget. 
The 
government 
has 
consolidated  the 
IFMS, 
which 
has 
permitted improved 
transparency 
of 
public 
financial 
operations 
through 
increased 
availability 
of 
real-time 
information 
and 
better 
controls 
through 
centralized 
payments 
and 
procurement 
processing 
for 
all 
MDAs. 
Twenty 
eight 
local 
government authorities 
(LGAs) 
operate 
IFMSs 
on 
stand-alone servers. 
As 
part 
of 
the 
strategy 
to 
promote 
transparency 
in 
the 
budgetary 
process, 
the 
government 
publishes 
quarterly 
releases 
to 
all 
the 
spending 
units, 
including 
LGAs. 
137. 
Notwithstanding 
these 
achievements, 
a 
number 
of 
outstanding 
issues 
need 
to 
be 
addressed 
over 
the 
medium 
term. 
The 
PRSC 
policy 
matrix 
hence recommends 
the 
following 
actions geared 
at 
improving 
budget 
formulation 
and execution over the 
coming 
three-year 
period: 
(a) 
approved 
budget 
(delineating 
priority 
sector 
budget 
codes 
in 
the 
context 
of 
PRSC2 
and 
PRSC3) 
in 
line 
with 
PRS objectives 
and continued protection 
of 
allocations 
to 
the 
priority 
sectors 
from 
cuts 
during 
budget 
execution; 
(b) 
three-year, 
rolling 
budget 
guidelines, 
consistent 
with 
PRS 
priorities 
(and 
resource 
needs 
identified 
during 
the 
PRS-sectoral 
review 
process), 
issued 
to 
MDAs 
and 
LGAs; 
(c) 
strengthening 
of 
policy 
units 
in 
all 
key/priority 
sector 
MDAs; 
(d) 
GFS 
classification 
for 
preparation 
of 
LGA 
budgets, 
as 
well 
as 
for 
the 
fiscal 
2005 
development 
budget, 
and 
preparation 
of 
2004 
LGA 
budgets 
using 
the 
MTEF 
format; 
(e) 
consistent 
reporting 
on 
budget execution 
starting 
in 
fiscal 
2003 
as 
per 
identified 
expenditure 
budget 
codes 
for priority 
sectors 
and 
items; 
(f) 
expenditure 
tracking 
work 
undertaken 
and 
recommendations 
to 
strengthen 
the 
reporting 
system 
implemented; 
(g) 
provision 
of 
user-friendly 
information 
to 
the 
public 
on 
budget 
performance, 
including 
LGAs’ 
budget 
and accounts 
information; 
and 
(h) 
quarterly 
budget 
execution reports 
for 
LGAs 
submitted 
to 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
(via PO-RALG). 
The 
annual 
PER-MTEF 
process 
monitors 
and  supports 
public 
expenditure 
reforms 
and 
fiscal 
policy 
and 
strategic  resource 
allocation.  Recommendations and 
findings 
of 
the 
PER 
process 
will 
be 
used 
to 
update and 
refine 
the 
policy matrix for 
PRSC2 
and 
PRSC3.

Public 
Service 
Reform 
and Improved 
Service Delivery 
138. 
In 
recent 
years, 
Tanzania 
has 
launched 
a 
number 
of 
major 
initiatives 
to 
pave 
the 
way for 
greater 
accountability, 
transparency, and 
integrity 
in 
service 
delivery 
by 
the 
public 
sector. These 
include 
(a) 
the 
public 
service 
reform 
program; 
(b) 
the 
local 
government 
reform 
program; 
(c) 
the 
public 
finance 
management 
reform 
program; 
(d) 
the 
national anticorruption 
strategy 
and action 
plan 
for 
Tanzania; 
(e) 
the 
national framework 
on 
good 
governance, 
delineating 
a 
comprehensive 
approach 
to 
improve 
governance; 
(f) 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
good 
governance 
coordination 
unit 
(GGCU) 
in 
the 
President’s 
Office; 
and 
(g) 
the launch 
of 
the 
legal 
sector 
reform 
program. 
This 
ambitious 
reform 
agenda 
seeks 
to 
attack 
the 
root 
causes 
of 
the 
public 
sector’s 
poor 
performance. 
Overall, 
sound  progress 
is 
being 
made 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
public 
service 
reform 
program. 
139. 
Among 
the 
reforms noted 
above, 
the 
PSRP 
plays 
a 
central 
role, 
because 
its 
objective 
is 
to 
improve 
accountability, 
transparency, 
and 
resource  management 
for 
service 
delivery. 
The 
program 
is 
closely 
linked 
to 
other 
major 
reforms 
in 
public 
finance 
and 
decentralization. 
The 
PSRP 
aims 
at 
transforming 
the 
public 
service 
into 
a service 
that 
has 
the 
capacity, 
systems, 
and 
culture 
for 
client 
orientation 
and continuous 
improvement 
of 
services. 
Under 
the 
transformed 
public 
service, 
public 
servants 
will 
be 
held 
accountable 
for 
specified  outputs 
and  outcomes. 
Therefore, 
the 
PSRP 
seeks 
to 
introduce-in 
a 
phased, 
systematic 
manner-a 
management 
environment 
based 
on 
performance and 
transparency. 
This 
is 
a 
long-term 
process 
intended 
to 
transform 
the 
public 
service 
into 
results-oriented 
management, 
which 
the 
Bank, 
along 
with 
other 
development 
partners, 
is 
supporting 
via 
a 
long-term 
APL. 
Strategic 
use 
of 
limited 
public 
resources 
toward 
service 
improvements 
in 
line 
with 
the 
PRS 
priorities 
and 
expenditures 
would 
require 
a 
transformation, 
which 
has 
been 
backed 
by 
some 
key 
policy 
changes, 
such 
as 
the 
public 
service 
management and 
employment 
policy 
and 
the 
public 
service 
pay 
policy 
(1990). 
140. 
Pay 
reform 
was a 
prominent 
component 
of 
the 
civil 
service 
reform 
Program. 
Beginning 
in 
fiscal 
1992/93, 
the 
government embarked 
on 
a 
reversal 
of 
the 
decline 
in 
civil 
service 
pay 
levels 
that 
had 
taken 
place over 
the 
previous 
decade. 
Since 
then, 
real 
pay 
levels have 
been 
significantly 
raised 
for 
all 
categories 
of 
personnel. 
Furthermore, 
in 
1996, 
the 
pay structure 
was made 
more 
transparent 
and 
efficient 
by 
consolidation 
of 
employment 
compensation 
allowances and benefits 
into 
basic 
salaries. 
This 
structure 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
need 
to 
manage 
the 
wage 
bill 
effectively. 
In 
January 
1999, 
the 
government  adopted a 
medium-term 
pay 
policy. 
The 
first 
phase 
of 
this 
policy 
restores 
the 
competitiveness 
of 
professional, technical,  and 
managerial 
salaries 
to 
enhance 
the 
government’s 
prospects 
when 
competing 
for 
recruitment 
and 
retention 
of 
such personnel. 
It 
is 
being 
implemented through 
annual 
pay 
awards 
in 
line 
with 
medium-term 
targets. 
Pay 
is 
also 
related 
to 
responsibilities 
through 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
findings 
of 
the 
ongoing 
job 
evaluation 
exercise. 
As 
a 
prior 
action 
for 
the 
PRSC1, 
the 
government 
has 
implemented 
pay 
enhancement 
in 
line 
with 
the 
approved 
budget 
for 
2002/03. 
14 
1. 
Although 
implementation 
has 
been 
slower  than 
anticipated, 
there 
has 
nevertheless 
been 
steady 
improvement 
in 
pay 
levels, 
particularly 
for 
professional,  technical, 
and 
managerial 
staff. 
The 
government 
recognizes 
that although 
it 
needs 
to 
improve 
the 
salaries 
of 
all 
public 
servants, 
more 
immediate 
attention 
needs 
to 
be 
paid 
to 
the 
categories 
of 
employees 
it 
finds 
hard 
to 
retain 
and that 
have 
an impact 
on 
the 
management 
of 
the country. 
In 
that 
same 
spirit, 
in 
July 
2002, 
the 
pay 
enhancement 
varied 
from 
6 
percent 
to 
22 
percent (senior level), 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
thrust 
of 
the 
policy.

an 
avcragc 
incrcasc 
of

pcrccnt 
instcad 
of 
thc 
envisaged 
17 
percent. 
Although 
progress 
is 
being 
made, 
the 
government 
would 
like 
to 
see 
the 
pace 
of 
implementation 
accelerated. 
A 
cabinet paper 
proposing 
a 
revised, 
accelerated 
pay 
strategy 
48 
Page  59
was discussed 
by 
the 
cabinet 
in 
March 
2003, 
and 
the 
principles 
were approved 
by 
cabinet 
in 
the 
context 
of 
that 
discussion. 
142. 
A 
public 
service act was 
passed 
in 
April 
2002, 
and 
its 
implementation 
could provide 
the 
basis 
for 
developing 
a 
meritocratic 
and 
transparent 
environment 
in 
the 
public 
service. 
The 
PRSC 
policy 
matrix 
calls 
for 
the 
harmonization 
of 
the 
public 
service  act 
with 
the 
local 
government 
service  regulations 
to 
ensure 
consistency 
and 
applicability 
at 
subnational  government  levels. 
However, 
the 
implementation 
of 
performance 
management 
has 
been 
rather 
slow. 
Annual 
plans 
and performance 
budgets 
are 
available 
for 
the 
civil 
service department 
(CSD)  and 
the 
ministries 
of 
agriculture 
and water. 
In 
the context 
of 
the 
PRSC2, 
it 
is 
anticipated that plans and 
budgets 
will 
be 
available 
for 
11 
MDAs,I3 
and approved 
annual plans 
and performance 
budgets 
are 
envisaged 
to 
be 
available 
for 
all 
MDAs 
under 
PRSC3. 
The 
plans 
will 
be 
complemented 
and 
informed 
by 
service 
delivery 
surveys 
to 
enable 
the 
government 
to 
assess 
client 
satisfaction 
with 
its 
delivery 
of 
services 
and 
assess 
progress 
in 
combating corruption. 
This 
will 
be 
complemented 
by 
the 
roll 
out 
of 
performance 
monitoring 
system 
in 
the 
11 
MDAs 
under 
PRSC2; 
this 
will 
be 
extended 
to 
all 
MDAs 
under 
PRSC3.

MINIMIZING 
RESOURCE 
LEAKAGE 
AND 
STRENGTHENING 
ACCOUNTABILITY 
Fiduciary 
Accountability and Procurement 
143. 
With 
the 
introduction 
of 
an 
IFMS 
and 
the 
enactment 
of 
the 
new 
Public 
Finance 
Act 
Number 
6 
of 
200 
1 
and 
the 
Public 
Procurement 
Act 
Number 
3 
of 
200 
1, 
the 
PRSC 
program 
will 
help 
Tanzania make 
further 
advances 
on 
the 
steps 
it 
has 
already 
taken 
to 
put 
into 
place 
a sound 
financial 
management 
system. 
The 
speed 
of 
implementation 
and 
integration 
of 
the 
IFMS 
and 
the 
legislative 
changes have, 
however, 
left 
a 
number 
of 
gaps, 
which, 
unless 
filled, 
will 
negate the 
benefits 
of 
the  recent 
achievements. 
In 
addition, 
issues 
of 
noncompliance, 
limited 
budget 
execution,  inadequate 
monitoring, 
insufficient 
capacity, 
and 
lack 
of 
enforcement 
need 
to 
be 
resolved. 
The 
specific 
weakness 
derives 
from 
the 
following 
key 
areas: 
(a) 
Central 
and 
local 
government accounting  and 
financial 
reporting 
are constrained 
by 
a shortage 
of 
qualified 
and 
experienced accounting 
and 
internal auditing 
personnel 
because 
of 
the 
unattractive  terms  and 
conditions 
of 
employment. 
(b) 
There 
is 
a 
lack 
of 
effective 
measures 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
fiduciary 
procedures, 
and 
there 
are 
weaknesses 
in 
government 
information 
technology 
policy 
and 
records 
management. 
(c) 
Public 
sector 
auditing 
is 
inadequately 
resourced 
in 
terms 
of 
both 
financial 
and 
human 
capacity. Furthermore, 
disparities 
prevail 
between 
audit and 
accounting 
staff 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
terms  and 
conditions 
of 
employment. 
The 
Public 
Finance 
Act 
Number 
6 
of 
2001 
bolsters the 
role 
of 
the 
National 
Audit 
Office 
as 
an 
independent 
entity 
with 
control 
over 
its 
financial 
and 
human 
resources, 
which 
is 
now 
mandated 
to 
it. 
It 
is 
important 
to 
ensure 
that 
these 
new 
legal provisions 
are 
implemented 
to 
secure 
the independence 
of 
the 
National 
Audit 
Office. 
The 
government 
is 
now 
taking 
measures 
to 
address 
some 
of 
these 
gaps 
and 
weaknesses 
through 
the 
revised 
public 
financial 
management 
reform 
program 
(PFMRP), 
which 
sets 
out 
the 
strategy 
for 
mitigating 
the 
associated 
fiduciary 
risks 
and 
strengthening 
the 
country’s 
financial 
accountability framework.

Over 
and 
above 
achieving 
its 
primary 
objective 
of 
providing 
a 
comprehensive 
fiduciary 
risk 
assessment, 
the 
CFAA 
process 
has 
also 
identified 
key 
actions 
to 
minimize 
resource leakages 
and 
strengthen 
accountability 
that 
need 
to 
be 
taken 
forward 
over 
the 
short and 
medium 
terms. 
The 
PRSC 
program 
will 
support 
the 
prioritization 
of 
these 
actions 
and 
the 
development 
of 
a 
concrete 
reform 
program 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
a 
feasible 
and 
costed 
plan. 
This 
has 
to 
be 
supported 
by 
an 
integrated 
technical 
assistance 
mechanism 
to 
assist 
the 
government 
in 
reviewing 
and 
updating 
the 
PFMRP 
and 
further 
development 
of 
a 
feasible, 
affordable, 
medium-term 
development 
plan 
covering 
the 
period 
2003-07. 
The 
medium-term 
plan 
would 
draw 
on 
the 
priorities 
identified 
in 
the 
CFAA 
(based 
on 
existing 
plans 
and 
reforms) 
and 
would 
propose 
a 
logical 
sequencing 
of 
reforms, 
as 
well 
as 
assess 
the  capacity 
to 
implement 
reforms, 
designing 
and 
costing 
a 
fully 
integrated revised 
program 
to 
support 
the 
implementation 
of 
capacity 
building, 
institution 
development, 
and 
regulatory 
reforms. 
This 
will 
provide 
an analytical underpinning 
for 
the 
design 
of 
the 
financial 
management component 
of 
the 
PRSC 
and, 
in 
particular,  establish appropriate 
targets 
and 
output 
indicators  and 
measures 
over 
the 
envisaged 
series 
of 
three  annual 
PRSC 
operations. 
The 
policy 
actions also focus 
on 
addressing 
the 
challenges 
of 
financial 
management 
and 
procurement 
issues 
in 
the 
context 
of 
decentralization, 
given 
the 
importance 
of 
an 
adequate 
fiduciary 
framework 
at 
the 
local 
government 
level 
for 
the 
delivery 
of 
services at 
the 
grassroots 
level. 
As 
a 
prior 
action 
for 
PRSC1, 
the 
government 
has 
approved the 
revised 
PFMRP, 
which 
includes 
the 
key 
agreed recommendations 
of 
the 
CFAA. 
Under 
PRSC2, 
the 
government 
is 
expected 
to 
have 
started 
implementation 
of 
the 
revised 
PFMRP, 
including 
the 
monitoring 
system 
and reports 
on 
progress. 
145. 
A 
robust 
process 
of 
collaboration 
between 
donors 
and government 
resulted 
in 
the 
design 
of 
a 
common 
set 
of 
policy 
actions 
and output 
targets 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
financial 
management 
pillar 
of 
the 
medium-term 
PRSC 
policy 
matrix. 
The 
policy 
matrix 
now 
includes 
the 
critical 
benchmarks 
drawn 
from 
the 
CFAA 
action 
plan. 
The 
group, 
led 
by 
the 
DfID 
and 
the 
Bank, 
has 
also 
drawn 
from 
the 
findings 
of 
the 
recent 
HIPC 
tracking 
and 
IMF 
fiscal ROSC 
studies, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
medium-term 
reform 
program 
under 
the 
PSAC 
LDP, 
for 
the design 
of 
this 
subcomponent. 
146. 
The 
CPAR 
has 
been 
prepared 
in 
parallel 
to 
the 
preparation 
of 
PRSC1, 
and 
implementation 
of 
the emerging 
procurement 
reform 
agenda 
is 
part 
of 
the 
policy 
matrix. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
during 
the 
preparation 
of 
PRSC2  and 
PRSC3, 
the 
focus 
on 
procurement 
reforms 
will 
increase 
to 
complete 
the 
public 
sector 
reform 
agenda.

147. 
The 
key 
medium-term 
outcome 
sought 
under 
the 
rubric 
of 
the 
PRSC 
program 
is 
the 
evidence 
of 
positive 
results 
in 
the 
fight 
against 
corruption, 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
joint 
efforts 
by 
various 
areas 
of 
the 
Tanzanian 
public 
service, 
including 
at 
the 
local 
government 
level. 
148. 
That 
said, 
progress 
is 
being 
made 
in 
the 
fight 
against 
corruption, 
with 
the 
focus 
on 
the 
development 
of 
an 
appropriate 
institutional 
framework. 
Although 
the 
Prevention 
of 
Corruption 
Bureau 
is 
not 
treated 
as 
a 
priority 
item 
under 
the 
PRS, 
its 
budget 
has 
increased 
substantially over 
the last 
few 
years. 
In 
addition, 
it 
is 
a 
testament 
to 
government’s 
commitment 
to 
this 
area 
that 
over 
four 
of 
the last 
five 
years, 
actual 
releases 
have 
been 
greater 
than 
the 
budget 
initially 
approved. 
The 
fiscal 
2002/03 
Prevention 
of 
Corruption 
Bureau 
budget 
is 
T.Sh. 
5.2 
billion, 
up 
from 
T.Sh. 
3.7 
billion 
in 
fiscal 
2001/02. 
Moreover, 
T.Sh. 
800 
million 
has 
been 
allocated 
to 
the 
newly 
established 
national 
integrity 
fund 
of 
the 
national 
anticorruption 
strategy 
and 
action 
plan 
(NACSAP).

149. 
In 
the context 
of 
the 
PRSC 
policy 
matrix, 
it 
has 
been 
agreed 
that 
quarterly 
reports 
outlining 
progress 
made 
by 
key 
MDAs14 
identified 
in 
the 
PRS 
would 
be 
available 
in 
a 
timely 
manner 
(within 
three 
months 
after 
the 
end 
of 
each  quarter). 
All 
MDAs 
need 
to 
comply 
with 
this 
requirement, 
but 
compliance 
by 
some 
has  lagged, 
and 
the 
quality 
of 
some 
reports  remains 
questionable. 
It 
will 
be 
important 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
key 
MDAs 
deliver 
in 
this 
respect. 
Eventually, 
the 
service 
delivery 
surveys, 
planned 
under 
the 
public 
service 
reform 
program, 
would 
be 
a 
useful 
tool 
to 
assess 
improvement 
over 
the 
years 
in 
anticorruption 
indicators. 
150. 
The 
government 
is 
now 
working on 
revising 
the 
national anticorruption 
strategy 
and action 
plan 
. 
The 
PRSC 
policy matrix 
includes actions 
calling 
for 
the 
approval 
of 
the 
revised national 
anticorruption 
strategy and 
action 
plan. 
It 
is 
anticipated that 
the 
revised 
plan 
will 
be 
available 
by 
the 
end 
of 
the 
calendar 
year, 
and 
an 
official 
launch 
might 
take place 
in 
the 
first 
quarter 
of 
2003. 
Attention 
to 
the 
actions 
related 
to 
the 
coordination 
and 
implementation 
of 
the 
plan 
are 
key, 
because 
it 
is 
recognized that 
the 
available 
human 
and 
financial 
resources 
will 
not 
be 
sufficient. 
15 
1. 
Furthermore, 
the 
actions 
included 
in 
the 
PRSC 
policy 
matrix 
support 
the 
preparation, 
financing,  and 
effective implementation 
of 
anticorruption action 
plans 
for 
LGAs. 
The 
process 
for 
producing 
anticorruption action 
plans 
at 
the 
local 
government 
level 
has 
changed, 
and a staggered 
approach 
is 
planned. 
The government 
recognizes 
that the plans 
have 
to 
be 
produced 
under 
a 
very 
tight 
timeframe. 
This 
action 
has 
been discussed 
previously 
with 
development 
partners 
and 
was 
expected 
to 
be 
completed 
in 
fiscal 
2002. 
It 
will 
be important that 
once 
the 
plans 
are approved, 
the 
required 
resource envelope 
is 
reflected 
in 
the 
budget. 
Improved 
Management 
of 
Development 
Aid 
Resources 
152. 
Another 
area 
of 
focus relates 
to 
the 
improved 
management 
of 
development 
aid 
resources 
via 
consolidation 
and 
subsequent 
integration 
of 
external 
resource 
flow 
projections 
into 
budget 
preparation, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
system 
for 
MDAs 
(and subsequently 
for 
LGAs 
via 
PO-RALG) 
to 
report 
to 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
on 
the 
levels 
of 
direct 
external 
assistance 
budgeted and 
disbursed. 
The 
finalization 
of 
the 
TAS 
action 
plan 
is 
one 
of 
the 
PRSCl’s 
required 
actions, 
and the 
issuance 
of 
the 
first 
and 
second 
TAS 
implementation 
reports 
is 
also a 
required 
action 
under 
the 
subsequent 
PRSC interventions. 
F. 
MAINSTREAMING 
THE 
ENVIRONMENT 
INTO 
THE 
PRSC 
PROCESS1s 
Background 
153. 
Tanzania 
is 
highly 
dependent 
on 
the 
use 
of 
natural 
resources 
and 
biodiversity 
for 
its 
economic 
growth 
and development, 
because 
agriculture, 
tourism 
(almost 
all 
of 
it 
nature-based), 
and 
mining 
being 
the 
mainstays 
of 
the 
economy. 
Poverty 
is 
widespread, 
especially 
in 
rural 
areas 
where almost 
all 
of 
the 
income 
is 
based 
on 
natural 
resources. 
A 
key 
source 
of 
vulnerability 
of 
the 
poor 
is 
the degradation 
and 
depletion 
of 
the 
environmental 
and 
natural 
resource 
base. 
Several 
steps 
have 
been taken 
to 
create a sound basis 
for 
addressing 
environmental 
degradation.  These 
include 
the 
national environmental action 
plan 
(1994) 
and 
the 
national environmental 
policy 
l4 
The 
judiciary; 
the 
ministries 
of 
works, 
education 
and 
culture, 
health, 
and 
home 
affairs; 
the 
attorney 
general’s 
chambers; 
and 
the 
TRA. 
l5 
It 
is 
noteworthy that 
the 
measures 
included 
in 
the 
PRSC 
policy 
matrix 
with 
respect 
to 
mainstreaming 
of 
the 
environment 
are 
exclusive to 
the 
PRSC 
instrument 
and 
are 
not 
supported 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
PRBS 
facility.

An 
institutional 
and 
legal 
framework 
for 
environmental 
management, 
providing 
the 
basis 
for 
environmental  impact 
assessment 
(EIA), 
cross-sectoral 
coordination, 
and 
integration 
of 
environmental 
management 
into 
local 
government 
planning 
processes, 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
cabinet 
in 
December 
2002. 
A 
number 
of 
key 
sector 
policies 
and 
strategies 
recognize 
the 
need 
to 
address 
poverty reduction 
objectives 
through 
mainstreaming 
environmental 
sustainability. 
These 
strategies 
include 
tourism, 
women 
and 
gender, 
rural 
development, 
agriculture,  forestry,  and 
fisheries 
and 
coastal 
management. 
Framework for  Mainstreaming 
the Environment into the 
PRSC 
Process 
154. 
The 
importance 
of 
environmental 
sustainability 
on 
poverty 
reduction efforts 
is 
expressed 
via 
the 
MDGs. 
The 
cross-sectoral nature 
of 
the environment and 
its 
direct 
and 
indirect 
linkages 
to 
the 
MDGs 
provide 
an 
opportunity 
to 
address 
its 
critical role 
in 
Tanzania’s 
economic 
growth 
and 
poverty reduction 
agenda 
through 
the 
PRSC process. 
Mainstreaming 
of 
the 
environment 
in 
the 
poverty  reduction 
agenda 
is 
a 
specific  target 
within 
the 
MDGs, 
expressed 
through 
Goal 
7: 
Ensuring  Environmental  Sustainability. 
Effective 
integration 
of 
the 
environment 
into 
policy 
reforms 
requires 
building 
strong 
partnerships 
through 
extensive 
consultation 
and  partnership 
processes. 
Mainstreaming 
of 
the 
environment 
into 
the PRSC process 
will 
be carried out 
by 
the 
VPO 
with 
the support 
of 
the 
United 
Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP), 
the 
Bank, the 
donor community, 
and  other 
stakeholder  groups. 
It 
is 
envisaged 
that 
the 
PRSC  process 
will 
operationalize 
high-priority 
activities 
already 
identified 
by 
the 
GOT 
for 
mainstreaming 
the 
environment 
into 
the 
PRS. 
The 
implementation 
of 
the 
policy 
approach 
for 
mainstreaming 
environment 
into 
the 
PRS 
and 
to 
promote 
pro-poor 
growth 
is 
reflected 
in 
a 
number 
of 
interventions financed 
by 
World 
Bank 
and 
bilateral 
donors. 
Examples 
of 
this 
new 
generation 
of 
initiatives 
include 
programs 
in 
forestry, 
agriculture, 
and coastal 
livelihoods. 
Specific 
actions 
supported 
by 
the 
PRSC 
include: 
155. 
Increasing 
the 
knowledge 
base 
on 
poverty-environment linkages: 
Lack 
of 
knowledge 
and 
awareness 
about 
environment 
and 
poverty 
linkages 
could 
lead 
to 
missed 
opportunities 
and 
efficiency 
in 
the 
government’s 
poverty reduction 
efforts, and 
this 
could 
increase 
the 
vulnerability 
of 
the 
poor 
to 
environmental 
risks. 
Mainstreaming 
of 
the 
environment 
into 
the 
PRS 
agenda 
is 
a 
dynamic 
process 
that 
will 
become 
more 
effective 
as 
more knowledge 
and 
awareness 
about 
the 
linkages among 
the 
environment,  poverty,  and economic 
growth 
become 
available. 
The 
PRSC 
will 
generate 
this 
knowledge  through 
supporting 
analytical 
work 
on 
poverty-environment 
linkages, 
which 
will 
be 
used 
to 
provide 
inputs 
into 
the 
PRS-PER 
process, 
and  sectoral  and 
district-level 
investment plans. 
156. 
Strengthening the existing 
poverty 
monitoring 
system: 
The lack 
of 
adequate 
information 
on 
the 
environment 
and 
its 
links 
to 
poverty 
will 
limit 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
poverty 
monitoring 
system 
and 
has 
implications 
for 
the 
broader  PRS 
process. 
Evaluation 
of 
the 
impact 
of 
PRS 
interventions 
on 
the 
environment, 
poverty, 
and government 
performance 
in 
meeting 
PRS 
targets 
requires 
an 
integrated 
system 
for 
monitoring 
the 
poverty 
and 
environment 
linkages 
at 
macro 
and 
micro 
levels. 
The 
goal 
of 
this 
activity 
is 
to 
strengthen 
the 
existing 
poverty 
monitoring 
system 
through 
linking 
it 
with 
environmental 
information 
systems 
supported 
by 
the 
PRSC process. 
The 
key 
actions 
that 
will 
be carried out 
under 
the 
PRSC2 and PRSC3 
cycle include 
(a) 
development 
of 
targets 
that 
are consistent 
with 
the 
PRS and sectoral development goals and 
identify 
and 
agree 
on 
timelines 
and 
thresholds 
that 
will 
be 
used 
to 
evaluate PRS 
implementation 
progress 
and 
(b) 
agreement 
on 
the 
action 
plan  for 
development 
of 
an 
effective 
institutional 
framework 
and 
capacity 
for 
the 
integration and 
management 
of 
the 
poverty-environment 
indicators 
in 
the 
existing  national  poverty 
monitoring 
system. 
Poverty-environment 
indicators 
collated 
and 
monitored 
under the 
poverty 
monitoring 
system 
will 
feed 
into 
PRS-PRSC 
process 
updates and

Establishing 
an 
effective, 
integrated 
environmental 
assessment 
process: 
Lack 
of 
sufficient  institutional 
capacity 
for 
integrated 
environmental 
assessment, 
including 
EIA 
and 
strategic 
environmental 
assessment 
(SEA), 
could 
limit 
the 
achievement 
of 
sustainable 
growth 
and 
development, 
it 
and 
may 
delay 
the 
implementation 
of 
certain 
PRSC 
actions-and 
through 
this, 
effective implementation 
of 
the 
PRS. 
Tanzania’s 
PRSC 
process intends 
to 
go 
beyond 
the 
Bank’s 
requirements 
for 
EIA 
and 
seeks 
to 
mainstream 
EIA 
and 
SEA 
as 
a 
planning 
and management 
tool 
to 
provide 
inputs 
and 
feedback 
to 
enhance 
sustainability 
of 
sectoral 
reform 
programs 
and 
provide 
inputs 
to 
sectoral 
and 
district 
plans. 
However, 
before 
the 
EIA 
and 
SEA 
can 
be 
effectively 
integrated 
into 
sectoral 
and 
district  planning 
processes, 
there 
is 
a 
need 
to 
solve 
the 
existing 
institutional 
ambiguities 
related 
to 
it. 
First, 
there 
is 
a 
need 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
recently 
approved 
institutional 
and 
legal framework 
for 
environmental 
management 
is 
effectively 
implemented 
to 
strengthen 
the 
EIA 
process 
in 
the 
country. 
This 
is 
of 
critical 
importance 
to 
ensure 
(a) 
that 
the 
environmental 
assessment 
process 
provides 
a basis 
for 
sound 
policymaking, 
(b) 
transparency 
in 
regulatory 
mechanisms and effectiveness 
in 
institutional 
coordination,  and 
(c) 
improved 
public 
consultation 
process. 
The 
PRSC 
will 
support 
the 
development 
of 
environmental 
assessment 
(ETA 
and 
SEA) 
processes and 
guidelines 
with 
regard 
to 
addressing 
poverty 
and 
livelihoods 
issues 
and 
their integration 
into 
sectoral and 
local 
government 
policy 
and 
planning 
processes. 
Finally, 
the 
PRSC 
process 
will 
support 
capacity 
building 
within 
the 
division 
of 
environment, 
the 
poverty 
eradication 
division, 
and 
the 
national 
environment 
management 
council 
for 
(a) 
implementing 
an 
effective environmental 
management 
policy 
and 
regulatory 
framework; 
(b) 
integrated 
EIA 
and 
SEA 
and 
management at national, 
sectoral, 
and 
district 
levels; 
and 
(c) 
strengthening 
partnerships 
for 
environmental 
and 
poverty 
monitoring.

VI. 
THE 
PROPOSED 
CREDIT 
AND 
GRANT 
158. 
The 
proposed 
PRSCl for 
Tanzania 
is 
a 
core operation 
to 
support 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Tanzanian PRS. 
It 
will 
be 
the 
first 
in 
a 
series 
of 
three 
single-tranche 
PRSCs 
proposed 
under 
the 
CAS 
to 
support 
the 
implementation 
of 
policies 
and 
institutional 
development  programs 
for 
sustainable 
growth 
and 
poverty 
reduction. 
These 
policies 
and 
programs  are 
contained 
in 
the 
country’s 
own 
PRS. 
Through 
coherence and stronger 
coordination 
with 
other 
externally 
assisted 
programs, 
particularly 
the 
PRBS, 
the proposed 
PRSCl 
will 
help 
to 
further 
integrate 
Bank 
support 
into 
the 
overall 
strategy 
under 
the 
TAS 
for 
raising 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
development 
assistance 
and 
reducing 
the 
transactions 
cost 
of 
aid delivery 
to 
Tanzania. 
Before 
presentation 
to 
the Board, 
Tanzania 
has 
achieved 
several 
key 
program 
benchmarks 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
reducing income 
poverty, 
broadening the impact 
of 
economic growth, 
increased effectiveness and 
accountability 
in 
public 
management, 
and 
improved efficiency 
of 
public 
service 
delivery. 
159. 
In 
coordination 
with 
other external 
assistance 
programs, 
the 
PRSC 1 supports Tanzania’s 
effort 
to 
scale 
up 
growth, broaden 
the 
impact 
of 
growth 
on 
reducing 
poverty, and 
improve 
access 
to 
and 
quality 
of 
public 
services. 
To 
these 
ends, 
the proposed 
credit 
will 
support actions 
to 
raise 
the 
level 
of 
private 
investment, 
enhance 
competitiveness  and 
productivity 
of 
the 
Tanzanian 
economy,  create 
an 
attractive  environment  and 
reduce 
bottlenecks 
in 
the 
growth 
of 
the 
rural 
economy, 
and 
support cross-cutting 
reforms 
in 
public 
sector management. Schedule 
2 
presents 
the 
performance 
assessment 
matrix 
for 
the 
medium-term 
program 
and 
for 
the 
PRSC 
1. 
The 
matrix 
also 
shows 
the harmonization 
with 
the 
PRS 
targets. 
160. 
The 
design 
of 
the 
PRSC 
takes 
into 
account 
requirements 
for 
coordination 
and 
harmonization 
with 
other 
development 
partners, 
particularly 
the 
PRBS 
donors. 
The 
motivation 
for 
this 
effort 
derives 
from 
the 
clear desire 
of 
both 
GOT 
and 
the 
development 
partners 
to 
ensure 
that 
all 
operations 
adopt: 
0 
0 
0 
a 
clear 
poverty 
focus guided 
by 
the 
homegrown 
PRS, 
coherence 
in 
policy 
dialogue 
at 
cross-cutting 
levels 
and 
in 
sector-wide 
programs, 
enhanced 
efficiency 
in 
policy 
dialogue 
and 
performance 
assessment, 
and 
enhanced 
flexibility 
and 
predictability 
of 
resource 
flows. 
161. 
To 
that 
end, 
the 
PRSCl 
has 
been 
harmonized 
with 
the 
PRBS 
with 
respect 
to 
both 
substance 
and 
process. 
The 
PAF/policy 
matrix, 
including 
the 
set 
of 
prior 
actions 
and 
triggers 
for 
the 
PRSC2, 
has been 
developed 
in 
close 
cooperation among 
the 
government, 
the 
PRBS 
donors, 
and the 
World 
Bank. The PRBS 
donors 
and 
the 
government 
had 
already agreed 
on 
a 
PAF 
before 
the 
development 
of 
the 
PRSC, 
and 
it 
served 
as 
the 
starting 
point 
and 
was 
extended 
to 
entail 
a 
greater 
focus 
on 
rural 
incomes 
during 
the PRSC preparation. 
Similarly, 
processes 
for 
the 
design 
and 
review 
of 
the 
PRSC 
and the 
PRBS 
are also 
being 
harmonized and integrated 
with 
the 
PRS 
and the budget 
process.

The  poverty 
monitoring 
master 
plan 
and 
various  other 
processes 
described 
in 
this 
document 
provide 
a 
robust and 
highly 
participatory 
framework 
for 
monitoring, 
and 
the 
PRSC 
will 
facilitate the implementation 
of 
these 
monitoring 
arrangements. 
The 
expected 
benefits 
from 
using 
the 
IDA 
grant 
is 
that 
it 
will 
help 
to 
galvanize popular 
support 
for 
difficult 
reforms through 
greater 
impact 
on 
the improvement 
of 
the 
social 
well-being 
and 
livelihoods 
of 
the 
poor 
and 
maintain 
debt 
sustainability 
achieved after reaching 
the 
HIPC 
completion point. 
The 
grant component 
will 
also 
enable 
stronger 
collaboration 
with 
bilateral 
donors and 
the 
European 
Union 
(EU), 
who-through 
PRBS 
facility-have 
emphasized 
protecting 
and 
raising 
budget 
allocations 
to 
such 
priority 
sectors 
as 
education, health, and water. 
The 
effects of 
IDA 
grants 
will 
be 
monitored 
by 
tracking 
expenditure 
allocation 
to 
these sectors 
and 
assessing 
the 
impact 
of 
public 
spending 
through 
the 
annual 
reviews 
of 
PRS 
progress reports. 
The 
annual 
debt

analysis 
proposed under 
this 
operation 
will 
enable 
monitoring 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
grant 
component 
in 
maintaining

Supervision 
and preparation 
of 
the 
subsequent 
credits 
will 
take 
place 
in 
close 
collaboration 
with 
other donors 
and 
be 
consistent 
with 
the 
PRS 
review 
mechanism. 
A 
joint 
PRBS-PRSC 
review 
will 
be 
conducted  semiannually 
to 
review 
progress  made 
in 
each 
of 
the 
program 
areas. 
In 
addition,  the 
achievement 
of 
PRSC targets 
will 
be 
assessed 
annually 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
PRS 
review 
that 
will 
document 
the 
progress  made 
in 
the 
PRS 
implementation 
and  analyze 
the 
outcomes 
of 
reforms, 
as 
well 
as 
gather feedback 
from  government 
officials 
on 
how 
the grant 
component 
helped 
achieve 
these 
targets 
and 
maintain 
debt 
sustainability. 
The 
reform 
program 
sets 
out 
clear quantitative 
and qualitative 
benchmarks 
for 
three 
years. 
The 
PRSC targets are 
fully 
consistent 
with 
the 
PRS. 
Given 
satisfactory 
progress, 
Tanzania’s 
reform 
program 
will 
be 
supported 
through 
subsequent 
PRSCs 
under 
the 
programmatic

will 
be 
disbursed 
in 
compliance 
with 
the 
stipulated 
single-tranche 
release

Disbursement 
will 
not 
be

are 
needed. 
Once 
the

the 
borrower 
will 
open 
and 
maintain a 
dedicated deposit account 
in 
U.S.

for 
the 
borrower’s 
use. 
As 
the

IDA 
will 
disburse 
the

Aspects 
173. 
Aside 
from 
the 
measures 
supported 
by 
the 
PRSC  that 
aim 
at 
the 
strengthening 
of 
governance, 
various 
processes are 
in 
place that 
aim 
at 
improved 
accountability 
and transparency 
for 
the 
use 
of 
public 
resources. 
The  Prevention 
of 
Corruption 
Bureau 
and 
the 
National 
Audit 
Office 
have 
been 
significantly 
strengthened 
during 
recent 
years, 
and 
the 
Bank 
is 
preparing a 
project that 
would 
support 
further 
strengthening 
of 
accountability 
mechanisms. The 
participatory 
PER-MTEF 
process 
provides 
for 
an 
open 
review 
of 
budgetary  performance. 
The 
CFAA 
on 
Tanzania  concluded 
that 
the  central  and 
local 
government 
financial 
management 
systems 
represent 
high fiduciary 
risk. 
The 
major 
recommendations contained 
in 
that  report 
have 
been 
reflected 
in 
the 
reform 
program 
supported 
by 
the 
PRSC. 
To 
ensure 
effective  implementation 
of 
the  reform,  the  government 
has 
developed 
the 
PFMRP,  the 
implementation 
of 
which 
will 
be 
monitored 
under 
the 
PER 
process. 
D. 
Benefits 
and 
Risks 
Benefits 
174. 
The 
PRSCl 
is 
designed 
to 
help 
the 
government 
implement 
its 
homegrown 
PRS 
and reach 
the goals 
articulated 
in 
the 
strategy. 
The reforms 
supported under the 
program 
will 
help 
raise 
growth 
and 
strengthen 
the 
institutional 
infrastructure 
needed 
to 
improve 
the 
public 
sector’s 
capacity 
to 
carry out 
its 
role 
more 
effectively, 
as 
envisioned 
in 
the PRS. 
A 
stable macroeconomic 
environment, 
improved 
budget 
execution, 
strong 
economic 
governance, 
an 
environment 
conducive 
to 
private 
sector and 
rural 
development (especially 
enhanced 
agricultural 
productivity 
and 
profitability), 
and 
a 
well-performing public 
sector 
offering tlie 
improvcd delivery 
of 
public 
services 
are 
essential 
if 
the government 
is 
to 
reach 
its 
goals 
for 
poverty 
reduction 
and 
improve 
the 
58

quality 
of 
life 
in 
Tanzania. 
A 
vital 
related 
element 
would 
be 
the 
effective 
monitoring 
and 
assessment 
of 
the 
progress 
and 
pitfalls 
related 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
PRS. 
Risks 
and 
Efforts 
to 
Mitigate 
Them 
175. 
Because 
the 
proposed 
PRSCl 
supports 
the 
implementation 
of 
Tanzania’s 
PRS, 
there 
are 
two 
closely 
interrelated  and overlapping 
sets 
of 
risks. 
The 
first 
set 
covers 
all 
risks 
that 
may 
interfere 
with 
the 
achievement 
of 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
PRS. 
The 
second 
is 
narrower 
and concerns 
risks 
to 
the 
successful 
implementation 
of 
actions 
covered 
in 
the 
PRSC 
policy 
matrix. 
The 
following 
risks 
can be 
identified 
at 
this 
stage: 
0 
As 
the 
next round 
of 
elections 
approaches, 
concerns about 
the 
durability 
of 
commitment 
to 
reforms 
will 
mount. 
To 
mitigate 
this 
risk, 
it 
will 
be 
essential 
to 
implement  legal 
and 
institutional 
changes 
to 
underpin reforms 
by 
the current government. 
This 
will 
reduce 
the 
risk 
of 
policy 
reversals and 
root 
these 
reforms more 
deeply 
in 
both 
attitude 
and 
practice. 
A 
program (ATIP) 
to 
support 
the 
government’s 
effort 
in 
bringing 
the 
institutional 
and 
legal 
framework 
in 
line 
with 
the achievement 
to 
date 
is 
under way. 
Inspiring 
investors’ 
belief 
that the 
changes 
made 
are 
durable 
is 
a 
major 
challenge 
in 
scaling 
up 
investor 
response. 
An 
important 
means 
to 
sustain 
reform 
and 
limit 
the 
possibility 
of 
policy 
reversals 
is 
the 
ongoing 
transition 
from 
a 
conditionality-based 
approach 
to 
reforms,. 
to 
the 
building 
of 
domestic 
constituencies 
for 
reform-which 
provides 
a 
more 
durable 
and 
secure 
basis 
for 
ensuring 
the sustainability 
of 
reform 
efforts. 
As 
policymaking 
has 
become 
more 
inclusive-with 
a greater 
role 
for 
stakeholders 
beyond 
the 
executive 
and, 
in 
particular, 
for 
parliament4ecisionmaking 
processes 
have 
tended 
to 
become 
more 
drawn 
out. 
This 
poses 
a 
risk 
primarily 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
speed 
of 
implementation 
of 
agreed 
actions, 
while 
the 
risk 
for 
significant 
policy 
reversals 
is 
considered 
to 
be 
reduced. 
The 
key 
mitigating 
measures 
contain 
two 
elements. 
The 
first 
is 
dissemination 
and knowledge sharing 
with 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
domestic constituencies 
on 
the 
rationale 
and benefits 
of 
reforms. 
The 
second relates 
to 
using 
the 
process 
leading 
to 
the 
definition 
of 
the 
PRSC 
policy 
matrix 
(PAF) 
to 
gauge 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
there 
is 
consensus 
on 
reforms 
among 
key 
constituencies and 
then 
sequence 
reforms accordingly. 
0 
Another 
risk 
for 
the 
achievement 
of 
PRS 
objectives 
arises 
from 
the 
ongoing 
decentralization 
process, 
which 
shifts 
responsibility 
for 
key 
poverty reducing 
programs 
in 
education, health, 
the water 
sector, 
and 
agriculture 
to 
the districts. 
Preliminary 
assessments 
indicate 
great 
variations 
in 
the 
quality 
and capacity 
of 
financial 
management 
and 
reporting 
systems 
across 
districts, 
in 
addition 
to 
often 
limited 
capacities 
to 
manage 
and 
implement 
poverty 
reducing 
programs. 
The 
local 
government 
reform 
program 
focuses 
on 
strengthening 
the 
capacity 
of 
local 
authorities. However, 
a 
residual 
risk 
remains, 
especially 
in 
the 
initial 
phases 
of 
the 
PRSC, 
that capacity-building efforts 
may 
lag 
behind 
the 
scaling 
up 
of 
programs. 
All 
phases 
of 
the 
PRSC 
support 
actions 
to 
strengthen 
the 
watchdog 
role 
of 
beneficiaries 
at 
the 
community 
level 
through 
disclosure 
of 
the 
flow 
of 
resources 
to 
various 
activities 
at 
the 
grassroots 
level 
and 
expenditure 
tracking 
of 
financial 
flows 
from 
the 
central 
government 
through 
the 
annual 
PERs. 
These 
actions 
will 
help 
to 
assess 
and 
mitigate 
risk. 
Although 
systems 
and 
capacities at 
the 
central 
level 
are 
generally 
stronger 
than 
at 
the 
local 
level, 
limited 
human 
resources 
capacity 
to 
implement 
and manage 
the 
PRSC 
reform 
agenda 
at the 
center represents another 
risk 
in 
the Tanzanian 
context, 
especially 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
public 
expenditure 
management,  procurement,  and 
financial 
management. 
To 
mitigate 
these 
risks, 
the 
proposed PRSC focuses 
appropriately 
on 
the 
strengthening 
of 
oversight 
arrangements. 
A 
large 
number 
of 
capacity-building  efforts 
are 
in 
place. 
Most 
reform 
programs have 
capacity-building 
components 
embedded, 
including 
the 
PFMRP, 
the 
local 
0 
e 
59 
Page  70
government 
reform 
program, 
and 
the 
public 
sector 
reform 
programs. 
Similarly, 
sector 
programs 
and 
projects 
typically 
also 
contain 
capacity 
building 
components. 
The 
challenge 
for 
Tanzania 
is 
to 
enhance 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
capacity-building efforts 
by 
shifting 
from 
supply-driven 
to 
demand-driven 
efforts 
and 
address 
capacity 
building 
in 
a 
holistic 
way, 
in 
which 
the 
incentive 
structure, 
education 
system, 
and 
specific 
capacity-building efforts 
are 
organized 
in 
a 
mutually  reinforcing 
manner. 
Analytic 
work 
to 
address 
these 
issues 
is 
planned. 
In 
the 
medium 
term, 
it 
is 
expected 
that 
the 
shift 
from 
project 
to 
budget 
support 
by 
the 
Bank 
and  other 
donors 
will 
release 
staff 
who 
are 
currently 
tied 
up 
in 
project 
management 
to 
play 
a 
greater 
role 
in 
overall public 
sector 
management. 
To 
ensure 
that 
such 
risks 
do 
not 
derail 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
PRS  and 
PRSC, 
appropriate 
monitoring 
instruments 
have 
been 
put 
in 
place. 
The 
government’s  annual PRS 
progress report, 
which 
builds 
on 
the 
recently 
developed, 
comprehensive

Mr.

President 
World

WASHINGTON 
D.C 
Dear 
Mr. 
Wolfensohn, 
RE: 
LETTER 
OF 
DEVELOPMENT POLICY 
1. 
I 
am 
writing 
to 
request, 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
Government 
of 
the 
United 
Republic 
of 
Tanzania, 
the 
first 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Support 
Credit 
and 
Grant 
(PRSCI) 
of  US$ 
132 
million 
(SDR 
equivalent) 
of 
which 
US$32 
million 
will 
be 
grant in support 
of 
our Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy. 
The 
proposed credit 
will 
reinforce our 
efforts 
to 
reduce 
poverty 
through 
maintaining 
macroeconomic 
stability, enhancing 
pro- 
poor 
growth 
and 
creation 
of 
employment. 
During this  long-term 
process, 
the 
proposed credit 
will 
help 
to 
support budgetary 
needs 
in 
the 
priority sectors 
which 
have a 
strong 
identifiable link 
to 
poverty 
reduction 
as  defined 
in 
the 
annual  Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy 
Progress Reports. 
1. 
BACKGROUND 
AND 
RECENT 
DEVELOPMENTS 
A. 
MACROECONOMIC 
PERFORMANCE 
2. 
Tanzania's 
macroeconomic performance 
continued 
to improve 
in 
2001/02. 
The 
GDP 
growth rate increased 
to 
5.6 
percent 
in 
2001 
and 
is 
estimated 
to 
have risen 
by 
5.9 
percent 
in 
2002 
despite 
a 
substantial deterioration 
in 
the 
terms 
of 
trade and 
a 
slow 
down 
in 
62 
Page  73
tourism-related 
travel 
due 
to 
the  adverse global 
security 
situation. 
Growth 
in 
2001 
stemmed  from 
relatively 
strong  performances 
in 
agriculture, 
mining, 
wholesale 
and 
retail 
trade, 
as 
well 
as 
manufacturing. 
The 
agriculture 
sector 
grew 
by 
5.5 
percent 
in 
2001 
up 
from 
3.4 percent 
in 
2000, with 
most 
of 
the 
growth 
emanating 
from 
food 
crop 
production 
and fishing. 
The 
growth 
of 
the 
mining 
sector 
remained 
strong 
at 
13.2  percent  and 
its 
contribution 
to 
GDP 
increased 
to 
2.5 
percent. 
Wholesale 
and 
retail  trade 
(including 
tourism) 
rose 
by 
7 
percent 
in 
2001. 
Industrial 
output 
rose 
by 
6 
percent. 
Growth 
in 
2002103 
is 
expected 
to 
stem from 
relatively 
strong 
performances 
in 
these 
same 
areas. 
The 
12-month rate of 
inflation 
declined 
further, 
from 
5.5 
percent 
in 
December 
2000 
to 
4.4 
percent 
in 
January 2003. 
Gross 
official reserves 
of 
the 
Bank 
of 
Tanzania 
(BOT) 
stayed above 
five 
months 
of 
imports 
of 
goods 
and services. 
B. 
TANZANIA 
POVERTY 
REDUCTION 
STRATEGY 
AND 
IMPLEMENTATION 
3. 
Tanzania 
remains 
committed 
to the goal 
of 
eradicating 
abject 
poverty 
set 
out 
in 
the' 
Development 
Vision 
2025. 
The framework 
for 
achieving 
this 
goal 
is 
articulated 
in 
the 
National 
Poverty 
Eradication 
Strategy 
(NPES 
- 
1997), 
the 
Poverty  Reduction  Strategy 
Paper 
(PRSP 
2000), 
and 
the 
Zanzibar 
Poverty Reduction 
Plan 
(2002). 
As 
at 
present, 
in 
the 
medium 
term 
the 
Government 
will 
continually 
seek 
to 
achieve 
the 
targets 
and 
outcomes specified 
in 
the annual 
PRS 
progress 
reports, 
and 
will 
maintain  policy 
intewentions, 
including 
budgetary 
allocations 
that 
reflect 
these 
priorities. 
Central 
to 
the 
PRS 
are 
the maintenance 
of 
macroeconomic stability, acceleration 
of 
pro- 
poor 
growth, 
and 
creation 
of 
employment. 
4. 
More 
specifically, 
the 
government's 
medium-term 
pro-poor 
growth 
strategy 
lies in 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
agricultural 
sector 
and 
rural 
development 
programmes, 
and further 
strengthening of 
the 
investment 
climate to 
attract 
private capital 
and 
technology, 
in 
order 
to 
lift 
productivity 
in 
agriculture and 
industry, 
particularly 
through small 
and 
medium-size 
enterprises. In 
this 
connection, 
the government 
will 
seek to 
achieve 
sustainable 
improvement 
in 
infrastructure, 
notably 
in 
transport, 
communications 
and 
energy. 
At 
the 
same 
time 
we 
are 
committed 
to 
removing 
remaining  weaknesses 
in 
the  regulatory 
63 
Page  74
framework,  law 
and order, tax 
administration, corruption 
and public 
administration. 
C. 
DEVELOPMENTS 
IN 
BUDGET 
SUPPORT 
AS 
THE 
MAIN 
INSTRUMENT 
FOR 
AID 
DISBURSEMENT 
IN 
SUPPORT 
OF 
THE 
PRS 
5. 
In 
1997 the 
Government 
requested 
the 
donor 
community  to 
provide assistance 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
Multilateral 
Debt 
Relief 
Fund 
(MDF). 
The 
intention 
of 
the 
fund 
was 
to 
provide 
support 
from 
donors 
towards 
servicing 
debt  obligations 
to 
multilateral  financial 
institutions. 
Disbursement 
of 
funds 
was 
based 
on 
actual 
debt 
obligations 
that 
matured 
during  a 
specific  period. 
In 
turn, 
the 
Government 
committed 
to 
allocate 
the 
budget 
savings 
from 
the 
MDF 
scheme 
to 
protected 
priority 
items 
in 
the 
social 
sectors. Countries 
contributing 
to 
the 
MDF 
were 
Denmark, 
Finland, 
Ireland, 
the 
Netherlands, 
Norway, 
Sweden, 
Switzerland 
and 
the 
United Kingdom. 
6. 
In 
November 
2001, 
Tanzania  reached 
decision 
point 
under 
enhanced 
Highly 
Indebted 
Poor Countries 
(HIPC) 
initiative. 
In 
order 
to accommodate 
this 
change, 
at 
the 
start 
of 
the 
2001102 
fiscal year 
all 
MDF 
donors 
transferred their disbursements to 
the 
Poverty Reduction 
Budget 
Support 
(PRBS) 
facility. 
Additional  members 
joining 
the 
PRBS facility 
were 
the 
European 
Union 
in 
fiscal year 
2000101, 
Japan 
in 
2001102 
and 
Canada 
in 
2002103, 
giving a total 
of 
eleven 
PRBS 
donors. 
7. 
A 
joint 
PRBS  Annual 
Review/ 
PRSC 
pre-appraisal 
was 
undertaken 
in 
November 
2002 
to 
harmonise 
the 
PRBS 
facility with 
the 
World 
Bank's 
PRSC 
(which 
replaces 
it's 
Programmatic Structural 
Adjustment Credit, 
PSAC 
from FY 
2003/04). 
This 
move 
to 
a 
common 
framework 
for 
poverty-oriented budget 
support 
from all sources will 
help 
to 
reduce 
overall transactions 
costs 
(through 
the agreement 
of 
a 
common 
policy 
Performance 
Assessment 
Framework 
(PAF) 
matrix 
which 
is 
to  be 
reviewed 
jointly 
by 
all 
stakeholders), 
as 
well 
as 
to 
reduce 
overall 
fiscal 
risk 
for 
the 
Government 
and 
the 
economy 
by 
raising predictability 
of 
inflows. 
From 
2003104 
the 
Government and 
the 
donors 
will 
consider 
the 
Partnership 
Framework 
(PF) 
- 
the 
harmonised 
PRBS 
and 
PRSC  budget 
support 
framework 
- 
as 
the 
common 
instrument 
of 
support 
to 
the 
Poverty 
Reduction  Strategy 
64 
Page  75
(PRS) 
through 
the Government's 
budget. 
The 
PF 
will 
be 
an integral 
part of 
the 
Government of 
Tanzania's 
public 
sector 
budgeting and 
priority setting 
process 
and 
the PRS. 
The 
budget 
will continue to 
be 
used 
as a tool to 
reach 
the 
PRS 
objectives, 
and 
priority 
sectors 
as 
defined 
in 
the 
PRS 
will 
be protected in 
the budget.

THE 
MEDIUM 
TERM 
REFORM 
PROGRAMME 
FOR 
POVERTY 
REDUCTION 
A. 
IMPROVED 
INVESTMENT 
AND BUSINESS 
ENVIRONMENT 
9. 
Given the 
importance 
of 
an 
effective 
public/private partnership 
in 
achieving 
better 
policies 
and 
a 
more 
enabling 
business 
environment for 
private 
sector 
development (that 
is, a better policy, 
administrative,  legal 
and 
regulatory 
environment), 
the 
Government 
approved 
the 
Business 
Environment 
Strengthening 
in 
Tanzania 
(BEST) 
programme 
on 
July 
22nd 
2002. 
The 
programme  aims 
at 
contributing 
to 
poverty 
reduction through 
private-sector-led 
economic 
growth 
and 
activities 
focusing 
on 
small 
and 
medium-sized 
enterprises. 
The 
programme 
recognises the 
key 
importance 
of 
an 
effective public/private partnership 
in 
achieving 
better 
policies and 
a 
more 
enabling 
business 
environment. 
As 
such, 
during 
the 
PRSC 
I 
pre-appraisal, 
the 
Government 
committed 
to  the  following 
PRSCI 
prior 
action: 
Approval 
of 
implementation 
plan 
for 
the 
Business 
Environment Strengthening 
of 
Tanzania 
(BEST) 
program 
by 
the 
Integrated Framework 
Steering 
Committee. 
Approval 
was 
made 
in 
February 
2003 
for the implementation 
of the 
BEST 
programme. 
In 
order 
to 
support the 
implementation 
of 
the 
programme, 
the 
Government 
is 
committed 
to 
the establishment 
and 
staffing 
of 
a 
Better 
Regulation Unit 
in 
the President's Office-Planning 
and Privatisation, 
with 
subsequent reviews conducted 
to monitor 
the 
implementation 
of 
BEST. 
65 
Page  76
IO. 
The government 
continues with 
its 
commitment to 
withdraw 
from 
economic activities 
and 
to 
create 
an 
enabling 
environment for 
private 
sector 
investment. 
The 
parastatal 
reform 
programme 
continues to 
make 
progress 
with 
a 
focus 
now on 
privatization 
of 
large 
utilities, companies 
and 
banks. 
Recent 
developments 
include 
the 
privatization 
of 
Air 
Tanzania Corporation (ATC), 
the 
concessioning 
of 
Dar es Salaam Water 
and 
Sewerage Authority 
(DAWASA), 
and 
the 
reaching 
of 
an  advanced 
stage 
of 
privatization 
of 
the  Tanzania 
Railways Corporation (TRC), the 
Tanzania 
Harbours 
Authority 
(THA) 
and the National Micro-finance 
Bank 
(NMB). 
In 
addition, the process 
of 
unbundling 
the 
Tanzania 
Electric 
Supply 
Company  (TANESCO) 
into 
autonomous commercial 
entities 
before privatisation 
is 
ongoing. 
A private management 
company, which 
took over 
in 
April 
2002, 
has 
begun  to  improve 
the 
finances 
of 
TANESCO. 
The 
government 
budget 
for 
2002/03  has made 
adequate 
provisions for 
payment 
of 
retrenchment benefits to 
employees 
who 
may 
be 
retrenched 
in 
the 
process 
of 
restructuring 
or 
privatisation 
of 
these public entities. 
11. 
In line with the 
PRSP, the 
Government 
aims 
to 
adopt 
a private 
sector development strategy 
-, 
with 
an 
aim 
of 
securing approval for 
its 
implementation by March 
2005. 
The President’s Office, Planning and 
Privatisation 
is 
committed to 
producing 
the strategy 
by 
January 2004 
through integrated public and 
private sector 
dialogue. 
12. 
The  Government 
is 
committed 
to 
the  Small 
and 
Medium 
Enterprises 
(SME) 
development 
policy, 
which 
was 
adopted 
in 
February 
2003 
and 
is, expected 
to be 
ready 
for  implementation 
by 
November 2003. 
It 
has been 
recognised 
that 
SMEs 
play 
a crucial 
role 
in 
employment  creation 
and 
income 
generation 
in 
Tanzania. 
Strategies 
for 
implementing  the 
SME 
development  policy 
in  the 
medium 
term focus 
on 
three main 
areas, 
namely 
the 
creation 
of 
an 
enabling 
business  environment; 
the 
development 
of  financial 
and 
non-financial  services 
strategies; 
and 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
supportive institutional infrastructure. 
It 
takes 
into 
account 
the 
specific 
constraints 
faced 
by 
this 
sector 
and 
aims 
at 
strengthening institutions 
that 
will address 
these 
constraints. 
GOT 
will promote consultations 
and  partnerships 
with 
the 
private 
sector 
to 
ensure  appropriate 
representation of 
SME 
relevant issues 
on 
the 
agenda 
of 
Tanzania 
National  Business  Council. 
Furthermore 
Ministry 
of 
Industry  and 
66 
Page  77
Trade 
(MolT) 
will 
have 
the 
overall responsibility 
for 
coordinating 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
SME 
Development 
Policy. 
MolT 
will  also 
coordinate 
the 
activities 
of 
all 
SME 
stakeholders 
and 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
organizing, 
monitoring, 
and 
evaluation 
of 
implementation 
of 
the 
SME 
Development 
Policy. 
13. 
In 
order 
to  establish 
clear  property rights that 
facilitate 
the 
securitisation 
of 
land, 
the 
mortgage 
industry 
and 
streamlined 
procedures for 
real 
estate 
transactions, 
the Government 
recognises 
that a 
key 
issue 
is 
the 
ability 
of 
individuals to 
use 
land 
as 
collateral. 
In light 
of 
this, 
the 
Government 
is 
considering 
amending 
the Land 
Act 
of 
1999. 
If 
deemed 
necessary, 
the 
amendment 
to 
the Land Act 
would 
be 
submitted 
to 
Parliament 
before 
the 
end 
of 
2003. 
Other 
policy 
measures 
in 
this 
area 
will 
aim 
at 
improving 
the 
land registry, 
and 
enhancing 
the 
capacity 
of 
the  commercial 
court, 
including 
the 
employment 
and 
training 
of 
more judges, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
keeping 
the 
average 
case 
resolution period 
below 
six 
months. 
The 
Government 
is 
also 
considering 
other avenues 
for promoting property 
rights. 
B. 
AGRICULTURAL 
AND 
RURAL 
DEVELOPMENT 
14. 
As 
a 
lead 
sector 
of 
the 
economy 
and 
a 
key 
to progress 
in 
social 
development 
of 
the 
population 
in 
rural 
areas, 
the 
Government 
sees 
reform 
in 
agriculture 
as 
a 
high priority. 
The 
objectives 
in 
the 
medium 
term 
are to 
ensure 
food 
security;  improve 
nutritional 
and 
living standards; 
increase 
agricultural 
exports 
and 
outputs 
from agro- 
based  industries; 
promote 
integrated 
and 
sustainable 
use 
and 
management  of 
natural 
resources 
to 
conserve 
the 
environment; 
develop 
human 
resources; 
improve 
animal  health 
and 
livestock 
productivity 
in 
order 
to 
enhance 
the 
quality 
of 
livestock 
products 
and 
income 
levels 
of 
farmers 
and 
livestock 
keepers. 
15. 
As 
a 
key 
part 
of 
the implementation 
of 
the 
PRS, 
the Agricultural 
Sector 
Development 
Strategy 
(ASDS) 
was 
completed and 
adopted 
in 
2001. 
ASDS 
identifies five  strategic 
issues 
for 
agriculture 
sector 
development: 
(i) 
strengthening 
the 
institutional 
framework; 
*(ii) 
creating 
a 
favourable  environment  for 
commercial 
activities; 
(iii) 
clarifying 
public 
and 
private 
sector roles in improving services; 
(iv) 
strengthening  marketing efficiency for 
inputs 
and 
outputs; 
and 
(v) 
mainstreaming planning 
for 
agricultural 
development 
in 
other 
sectors. 
67 
Page  78
16. 
The 
Agricultural 
Sector 
Development 
Programme 
(ASDP) 
is 
to 
be 
used 
as 
a 
tool 
for 
implementing 
the 
Agricultural 
Sector 
Development 
Strategy 
(ASDS). 
During 
the  PRSC 
1 
pre-appraisal, 
the 
Government 
committed 
to the 
following 
PRSC 
1 
prior 
action: 
Finalized 
and 
adopted 
for 
implementation 
the Agricultural 
Sector 
Development 
Programme 
(ASDP) 
Framework 
and 
Process 
document. 
The 
ASDP 
framework  and 
process 
document 
was 
completed 
in 
December 
2002. 
It  has 
been 
organized  around 
three 
sub- 
programmes, 
namely: 
agricultural sector 
support 
and 
implementation 
at 
district 
and field 
level 
through 
District 
Agricultural 
Development 
Programmes 
(DADPs) 
and 
District 
Development 
Plans 
(DDPs); 
agricultural 
sector 
support 
at 
the 
national level with a 
focus on the 
role 
of 
central 
government; 
and the 
management of 
ASDP 
links 
with 
other 
sectors. 
In 
the 
medium 
term 
the 
Government 
intends  to 
develop 
a 
monitoring 
system 
for 
the 
sector, 
which 
will 
set 
performance 
targets 
and 
indicators for 
tracking 
progress  made 
in 
implementing 
ASDP 
within 
the 
PRS 
monitoring 
framework. 
17. 
In 
order to 
increase 
agricultural 
trade 
in 
the 
medium term, the 
Government 
will 
review 
the role and 
funding 
arrangements 
of 
Crop 
Boards 
in 
order to limit their 
functions, 
which 
currently 
span services, 
taxation 
and 
the 
marketing 
of 
crops 
which 
they 
regulate. 
In 
order 
to 
improve internal 
trade, the 
Government 
has 
instructed 
all 
regions and 
district  actors  to 
remove 
road 
blocks 
which 
has 
facilitated  freer 
movements 
of 
agricultural 
products. 
There 
are 
also 
aims 
of 
developing 
and 
implementing 
a 
program 
to 
strengthen 
the 
institutional 
arrangements 
for 
district 
road 
maintenance 
and 
rehabilitation. 
In 
addition, 
in 
order  to 
promote 
the 
exportation 
of 
agricultural 
produce 
and 
increase 
efforts 
towards 
raising 
export 
earnings, there 
are on-going 
efforts to 
eliminate 
all 
non-tariff barriers 
within 
the 
EAC 
and 
SADC 
as well 
as 
to 
enhance 
performance 
of 
the 
recently 
established 
Export 
Credit 
Guarantee Scheme, 
which caters 
for 
traditional 
exports.

In 
an 
attempt 
to 
improve 
access to 
essential 
agricultural 
and 
rural financial 
services, 
the 
parliament 
has 
approved the 
amendments 
to 
the 
law 
for  establishing 
the  legal, 
regulatory 
and  supervisory 
framework for 
micro-finance institutions 
in February 
2003. 
Efforts 
are 
also  underway 
to 
introduce 
a 
more 
diverse  range 
of 
products 
available 
to 
borrowers 
by 
putting 
in 
place 
an enabling 
environment 
to 
facilitate the provision 
of long-term finance to 
the 
productive 
sector. 
Proposals for  the 
establishment 
of 
institutions, 
which 
will 
provide 
long-term  financing  for 
agriculture,  industry 
and 
housing 
will 
be 
submitted to 
the 
government 
during 
the second 
half of 
2002103. 
19. 
Improved tenure 
security 
is 
also 
an 
important 
objective 
and 
to 
this effect 
the 
Government 
aims 
to 
prepare 
a prioritised 
strategic 
plan 
and 
a 
corresponding 
program  to 
strengthen 
the 
administrative 
capacity 
for 
implementation 
of 
the 
Land 
Act 
and 
the 
Village Land Act. 
C. 
IMPROVED 
POVERTY 
MONITORING 
AND 
EVALUATION 
20. 
The 
annual 
PRS 
progress 
reports, 
which 
outline 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
PRS, 
continue 
to 
be 
formulated, implemented 
and monitored with effective 
participation 
of 
all 
stakeholders. 
The 
second  annual 
PRS 
progress 
report 
is 
due  to 
be 
finalized 
and 
published 
by 
the 
end 
of  March 
2003. 
Two 
agreed 
PRSCI 
prior 
actions were: 
Published a 
stakeholder-reviewed 
PRS progress 
report 
for 
FY02 
and  the 
Poverty 
and 
Human 
Development Report 
(PHDR), including 
HBS 
and 
ILFS 
findings; and 
Positively reviewed 
(in form 
and 
substance 
satisfactory 
to 
stakeholders) 
2"d 
annual 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy 
(PRS) 
Progress Report for 
FY 
2001/02, 
referred 
to 
above. 
The  report 
has 
been 
prepared 
on 
the  basis 
of 
joint  discussions 
including a 
wide 
range 
of stakeholders 
during 
both 
the 
Poverty 
Policy 
Week 
in 
September 
2002 
and the 
Consultative 
Group 
meeting 
held 
in 
Dar 
es 
Salaam 
in 
December 
2002. 
It 
has 
also 
incorporated 
comments 
from the 
Joint 
World 
Bank/ 
IMF 
Mission. 
In 
all, 
it 
has 
received a  positive review 
from 
the 
CG 
joint  donor 
statement, 
the 
PRBS Annual  Review 
and 
the 
positive 
initial review assessment 
of 
notes 
from 
IMFNVorld 
Bank 
on 
the 
2"d 
PRS 
Progress 
Report. 
The 
Joint 
Staff 
Assessment 
will 
be 
presented 
to 
the 
IDA 
Board along 
with 
the 
PRSC 
1 
in 
May 
2003. 
The  report 
draws 
on 
the 
Poverty 
and 
Human  Development  Report 
(PHDR) 
which 
was 
also  discussed 
69 
Page  80
during 
the 
Poverty 
Policy 
Week 
in September 
2002. 
This 
presents 
information 
on 
the 
implementation 
of 
various 
aspects  of 
the 
PRS 
including 
analyses 
of 
PRS 
targets, macro-micro 
poverty 
linkages, 
the 
geographic 
diversity 
of 
poverty 
and 
a 
conceptual framework 
to 
further 
guide the analysis 
of 
vulnerability. 
It 
has 
included 
major 
findings 
from 
the 
Household 
Budget  Survey 
(HBS) 
and 
the 
Integrated 
Labour 
Force 
Survey (ILFS), 
both 
of 
which 
have 
been published 
as separate 
reports. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Participatory 
Poverty Assessment 
(PPA) 
programme was 
launched 
in 
2002 
as part 
of 
the 
poverty 
monitoring 
framework. 
The 
field 
work  was 
conducted 
during 
April-June 
2002 
and 
the report is 
currently 
being 
finalized. 
The 
PPA 
has 
focused 
on 
vulnerability, 
an 
area 
which 
was 
identified to 
have 
an 
information 
gap 
in 
the 
original 
PRSP. 
21. 
The 
third 
annual  PRS 
progress  report will 
contain 
valuable 
information  drawn 
from 
the 
Population 
and 
Housing 
Census 
(September 
2002), 
and 
from an 
Agriculture 
Survey 
to 
be 
conducted 
in 
2003. 
The 
former 
will 
measure 
poverty indicators 
more 
directly and 
at 
a  highly 
disaggregated level, thereby 
informing  the 
PRS 
as 
a 
national strategy 
on 
how 
to 
be 
more 
responsive 
to 
local-specific 
problems. 
The 
latter 
will  provide  better 
understandings 
of 
the 
linkages 
between 
agriculture, 
the 
main 
economic activity, 
and 
poverty 
and 
will thereby 
help 
to 
better 
inform 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
PRS 
as 
well as 
the 
Rural 
Development 
Strategy 
and 
the Agriculture 
Sector 
Development Strategy. 
22. 
The 
improvement 
of 
the 
Poverty 
Monitoring 
System 
(PMS) 
is 
a 
crucial 
process 
in 
the effort 
to 
better implement 
the 
country’s 
PRS. 
In 
an 
effort to advance 
the 
PMS, 
a 
group of existing 
poverty 
monitoring 
indicators of  social 
well-being 
identified 
in 
the 
Poverty 
Monitoring 
Master 
Plan 
are 
being extended 
and 
developed further, 
based 
on 
data 
availability, 
data 
quality 
and 
relevance to 
poverty. 
This work 
is 
being 
undertaken 
in 
a 
joint stakeholder process 
and 
the 
monitoring 
of 
agreed 
indicators 
will 
be 
reported 
in 
the 
annual 
PHDR. 
It 
is 
intended 
that 
this will improve 
the 
PMS and 
also 
form 
the 
basis 
for on-going 
harmonized 
donor 
- 
Government 
discussions 
on 
monitoring 
in the 
context 
of 
the 
budget 
support 
framework. 
In 
addition, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
global 
agenda 
for 
poverty 
reduction 
, 
the 
Government 
also 
continues 
in 
its 
effort 
to 
incorporate 
the Millennium 
Development 
Goals 
into 
the 
Poverty

23. 
In 
view 
of 
carrying 
forward 
these 
improvements, 
the 
Government 
is 
committed 
to 
developing 
an 
action 
plan 
for 
strengthening 
capacity 
in 
the  Secretariat 
of 
the 
Vice 
President's 
Office 
to 
support 
and 
monitor 
implementation 
of 
the 
PRS, 
as 
well 
as 
for 
strengthening 
the 
coordination 
and 
monitoring 
unit 
in 
the 
President's Office 
- 
Regional Administration 
and 
Local Government 
for 
collecting 
and 
analysing 
administrative 
data. 
D. 
MACROECONOMIC 
STABILITY 
24. 
The 
overarching focus 
of 
macroeconomic 
policies 
in 
2003104 
will 
be 
towards 
consolidating 
and 
maintaining 
macroeconomic 
stability 
and 
external 
solvency 
whilst 
implementing 
key 
sectoral 
strategies, 
as 
enshrined 
in 
the 
PRS. 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
exogenous 
shocks 
the 
real 
GDP 
is projected 
to 
grow by 
6.3 
percent 
in 
2003, 
rising 
to 
7.4 
percent 
by 
the 
year 
2006. 
Monetary 
policy 
will 
be 
geared 
towards 
reducing 
the inflation rate to 4 
percent 
by 
end-June 2004, 
and 
thereafter 
consistent 
with major 
trading partners. 
External 
sector 
policies 
will 
remain 
consistent 
with 
maintaining 
foreign 
exchange 
reserves 
above 
5 
months 
of import of 
goods 
and 
non-factor 
services, 
25. 
Monitoring 
of 
the  macroeconomic 
framework 
is 
currently 
under 
the 
IMF 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Growth 
Facility 
(PRGF) 
programme. 
The 
Fifth 
PRGF Review 
was 
completed 
by 
the 
IMF 
Board 
in 
November 
2002. 
i) 
Fiscal 
Policy 
and 
Budgetary 
Reform 
26. 
The 
prevailing 
low 
level of  revenue to 
GDP 
ratio 
calls 
for  a 
sustained 
revenue 
mobilization 
effort  in 
order 
to  improve 
revenue 
collections 
and 
hence enhance government's 
ability 
to fight 
poverty. 
The 
focus  of 
2003104 
fiscal  policy 
is 
to 
raise 
the 
revenue 
yield, 
measured 
by 
the 
ratio 
of 
revenue 
to 
GDP, to 
above 12.8 
percent. 
The 
policy 
interventions 
will 
focus towards 
curbing tax 
evasion, 
controlling 
tax 
exemptions 
and 
improving 
tax 
administration. 
27. 
Given 
conflicts 
in 
the 
legal 
and  constitutional 
frameworks 
between 
central 
government and 
local 
government 
taxation 
systems, 
the 
Government 
has  adopted  a 
strategy  for 
harmonisation 
and 
71 
Page  82
rationalisation 
of 
local 
government 
taxes and 
levies. 
A 
committee 
has 
been 
established to 
guide 
this 
process. 
Broad guidelines 
for 
tax 
harmonisation 
were 
issued 
to 
Local Government 
Authorities 
(LGAs) 
in November 
2002, 
Currently the 
committee 
is 
working 
on 
identifying 
the 
taxes 
that 
will 
be 
addressed 
for 
the 
achievement 
of 
harmonised 
local 
and 
central government 
tax regimes. 
28. 
In 
view 
of 
improving 
the 
effectiveness 
and 
efficiency 
of 
the tax 
administration 
system, 
three 
diagnostic studies 
have 
been 
completed 
and  their  final 
reports 
produced. 
These 
include  the 
“Review 
of 
Tanzania 
Revenue Authority” 
by 
Massawe 
Ernst  and 
Young, 
the 
“Tanzania: 
Prion’ties 
and 
Strategies 
for 
Revenue 
Administration 
Reforms” 
by 
the 
IMF 
and 
the 
“Review 
of 
Tax 
Policy 
and 
Tax 
Administration: 
increasing 
Revenue” 
by 
Research 
on 
Economic 
Policy 
Implementation 
and 
Management 
(REPIM) 
for  the 
Public 
Expenditure 
Review 
(PER). 
The 
Government 
has 
prepared 
an action 
plan 
for 
the 
adoption  of 
the 
recommendations 
arising  from  these 
studies. 
Furthermore,’ 
the 
development 
of 
TRA’s 
new 
corporate plan 
is 
at an 
advanced 
stage 
and 
it 
is 
expected 
to be approved 
by 
the 
TFW 
Board 
in 
July 
2003. 
29. 
The 
mainstay 
of 
revenue 
policies 
crucially 
includes 
reducing 
revenue 
leakages. 
The 
Act 
on 
Export 
Processing 
Zones 
(EPZ) 
was 
enacted 
by 
the 
Parliament 
towards 
the 
end 
of 
fiscal year 
2001102 
to 
promote 
export 
growth. 
To 
that 
effect 
EPZ 
(General) 
Regulations 
2002 
and the 
Customs 
(Export 
Processing 
Zones) 
Regulations 
2002 
have  been 
developed 
and 
finalized. 
However, 
the 
Government 
is 
continuing  to 
study 
these 
regulations 
the 
view 
to 
identifying 
any 
further  potential 
revenue  leakages 
in 
future 
and 
ensure 
proper 
management of 
EPZ 
operations. 
30. 
Further 
efforts 
in 
tightening 
leakages 
have 
involved 
the 
abolition 
of 
Government 
VAT 
exemptions 
on 
petroleum 
imports 
in 
July 
2000, 
followed 
by 
the 
abolition 
of 
Government 
VAT 
exemptions 
on 
all imports 
and then 
the 
abolition 
of 
exemptions 
on 
import 
duties 
in 
July 
2002. 
As 
a 
result 
the 
Government 
currently 
pays 
VAT 
and 
import duties 
on 
all 
goods 
and 
services consumed 
except 
for 
the fully 
donor-funded 
projects. 
Overall 
the 
operation 
has 
been 
fairly 
smooth. 
Furthermore, 
establishment 
of 
a 
Large 
Tax 
Payer Department 
(LTD) 
to 
facilitate 
service 
to 
large 
taxpayers 
is 
a 
significant step towards 
72 
Page  83
raising 
the  efficiency 
of 
revenue collection. 
LTD 
currently 
collects 
more 
than 
40 
percent 
of 
total 
tax 
revenue from 
less 
than 
0.1 
percent 
of 
taxpayers. 
ii) 
Monetary 
Policy 
and 
Financial 
Sector 
Reform 
31. 
The 
Bank 
of 
Tanzania 
(BOT) 
will 
continue 
to 
observe 
closely 
the 
developments 
in 
both 
the 
domestic economy 
and the 
external 
sector in 
order 
to 
guide 
the 
conduct 
of 
appropriate monetary 
policy 
stance. 
Liquidity 
management 
will 
be 
targeted 
towards 
ensuring 
that 
growth 
in monetary aggregates 
is 
consistent 
with inflation.  In 
view 
of 
the 
recent increase 
in the 
demand for 
money 
daily  reserve money 
tracking  will 
be 
strengthened 
to 
sharpen 
liquidity 
management 
techniques 
while 
avoiding market distortions. 
Open 
market 
operations 
will 
remain 
the 
main monetary 
policy 
instrument, supplemented 
by 
foreign 
exchange 
market interventions. 
The main challenge 
of 
BOT 
will 
be 
to 
control the 
high liquidity 
that emanates 
from 
foreign 
inflows, 
including 
foreign 
direct 
investment 
resources. 
The 
Bank 
in 
collaboration 
with the 
Government 
will 
continue 
to 
devise 
long-term 
instruments 
in 
order 
to 
help 
efforts 
to 
control 
liquidity 
position 
in 
the 
economy. 
32. 
In 
order 
to 
promote  financial  intermediation 
and 
further 
development 
of 
the financial 
sector, 
BOT 
is 
collaborating with 
the 
government 
to 
implement 
measures 
directed  towards 
removing 
impediments 
to 
bank lending. 
Accordingly, 
problems 
in herent 
in 
the 
land 
law, 
collateral 
enforcement, 
inconsistencies 
in 
the 
existing 
legal 
framework, 
coupled 
with 
weak 
regulatory 
and 
supervisory 
mechanisms are 
currently 
being 
reviewed. 
iii) Debt 
Sustainability 
33. 
The 
Government 
has 
started 
implementing 
the 
key 
recommendations 
of 
the 
recently approved 
National 
Debt 
Strategy. 
The 
improved 
procedures will 
be 
formalized 
by 
amendments 
to 
the 
Government 
Loans, Guarantees 
and 
Grants 
Act, 
1974, 
and 
enacting 
the 
new 
Act which will 
consist 
of 
the 
following: 
(i) 
vesting authority 
to 
raise 
money 
by 
loan, to issue 
guarantees, 
and to 
accept 
grants on 
behalf 
of 
the 
Government 
solely 
with 
the 
Minister 
for 
Finance; 
(ii) 
establishment 
of 
the National 
Debt 
Management 
Committee 
(NDMC), 
which replaces the current 
Debt 
Coordination 
Committee 
(DCC), 
to 
advise 
the 
Minister 
for 
Finance, 
(iii) 
publication of 
a 
statement 
on 
73 
Page  84
a"l 
borrowing 
and repayment 
plan 
as 
part of 
the 
annual budget 
process; 
and 
(iv) 
amendment 
of 
laws 
of  parastatal 
bodies  and 
corporations 
to 
withdraw 
such institutions' 
power 
to 
borrow without 
approval of 
the 
Minister 
for Finance. 
The 
Government's 
commitment 
to 
amending 
this 
act 
is 
reflected in the agreed 
PRSC 
1 
prior 
action: 
Presented 
for 
Parliament 
approval 
the  amended 
Loans, 
Guarantees 
and  Grants 
Act 
No. 
30 
of 
1974 
to 
ensure 
a 
prudential 
debt  contracting 
and 
management 
system 
for 
government 
and 
independent 
public 
institutions. 
The 
draft amendment 
of 
the 
Loans, Guarantees 
and 
Grants Act 
has 
already 
been 
gazetted 
and submitted 
to the 
Parliament. 
As 
part 
of 
the budget process, 
the 
Minister 
will continue 
to submit 
to 
the 
Cabinet 
the  funding 
plan 
for 
each 
fiscal  year, 
so 
as 
to  obtain 
an  overall 
approval 
for 
borrowing during 
the 
year.  The 
Minister 
will 
henceforth 
report 
to 
(he 
Cabinet on 
a quarterly 
basis 
the  status of 
borrowing 
during 
the 
period, 
the 
debt 
service 
payments 
made, 
and generally 
the 
implementation 
status of 
the  National Debt 
Strategy. 
In 
terms 
of 
borrowing strategy, 
external 
financing 
is 
restricted 
to 
concessional 
financing of 
high 
priority programmes, such 
as 
education, 
energy 
and 
infrastructure 
and 
for direct budget 
support. 
34. 
On 
domestic 
debt, 
the 
government continues 
to 
implement its 
policy 
of 
non-accumulation 
of 
arrears.  The 
conversion 
of 
un- 
securitized domestic liabilities into marketable 
securities 
is 
ongoing. 
The 
menu 
of 
instruments 
available 
for the 
purpose of 
this conversion 
has 
already 
been 
expanded considerably with 
the launch 
of 
the 
5, 
7 
and 
10 
year Treasury 
bonds 
- 
also 
listed 
on the 
Dar 
es 
Salaam Stock 
Exchange. 
This 
will 
among 
other 
benefits help institute 
a 
meaningful 
benchmark 
for 
the  pricing 
of 
private 
sector 
long-term 
debts 
in 
the 
economy 
as 
well 
as 
expand  activity 
in 
the 
Dar 
es 
Salaam 
Stock 
Exchange. 
35. 
In 
light of 
a 
large 
stock 
of 
parastatai 
debt, 
the 
Government 
plans 
to 
conduct 
a 
study 
with  the 
aim 
of 
getting 
a 
clearer 
understanding 
of 
the 
maturity 
profile 
of 
these 
contingent 
liabilities, 
as 
well 
as 
suggesting 
ways 
to fund repayment 
of 
the same 
when 
need 
arises. 
The 
study 
is 
due 
to commence 
soon 
and 
be 
completed 
by 
June 
2003.

IMPROVEMENT 
IN 
THE 
EFFECTIVENESS 
OF DELIVERY 
OF 
PUBLIC 
SERVICES 
i) 
Budget 
formulation 
and 
execution 
36. 
The 
budget 
formulation 
process 
in 
the 
medium 
term 
is 
intended 
to 
enable 
effective 
resource 
allocation 
for 
poverty 
reduction. 
According 
to 
the 
Budget 
Guidelines 
2003104 
total 
expenditure 
has 
been provisionally 
forecasted  at 
23.4 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2003/04 
representing 
an 
increase 
of 
1. 
I 
percentage points 
from 
the 
previous 
year. 
The 
Budget 
Guidelines 
are 
consistent with 
PRS 
priorities 
and 
the  identification 
and 
definition 
of 
expenditure 
codes 
for 
priority 
sectors/items 
have 
been 
included. 
They 
have 
been 
issued 
to 
Local 
Government 
Authorities 
(LGAs) with the 
requirement 
of 
the  use 
of 
GFS classification 
for 
preparation 
of 
LGA 
budgets. 
37. 
Being 
mindful 
of 
the 
need 
to 
enhance 
civil 
service salaries in 
order 
to 
improve 
the 
efficiency  of 
public 
service 
delivery,  the 
Government is 
pursing 
civil service 
pay 
reform. 
Civil service 
salaries 
have 
been 
forecasted 
to 
increase 
by 
an 
average 
of 
17 
percent in 
2003/04. 
In 
addition, 
the Selected 
Accelerated Salary 
Enhancement 
(SASE) 
is 
expected 
to 
expand 
further to 
cover 
[4] ministries. 
Pursuant 
to 
the government’s 
policy 
of 
privatising 
public 
enterprises 
the 
budget 
for 
2003/04 will 
provide for 
the 
possible 
cost 
of 
retrenchments 
for 
enterprises 
subject 
to 
privatisation 
in 
2003104. 
It 
is 
also 
the 
aim 
of 
government 
to 
consolidate 
improvements 
within 
IFMS 
so 
as 
to 
ensure 
no 
budgetary arrears 
accumulate. 
38. 
Transparency 
of 
budget 
execution, 
centrally 
as 
well 
as 
locally, 
is 
maintained 
by 
the 
publication 
of 
quarterly budget 
execution reports 
by 
the Ministry 
of 
Finance (on 
the 
national 
website) 
and 
the 
LGAs 
(which submit 
their 
reports 
to 
PO-MLG 
which 
then consolidates the 
information). 
Furthermore, 
an 
expenditure 
tracking 
survey 
is 
currently 
being 
conducted under 
the 
Public Expenditure 
Review. 
75 
Page  86
39. 
In 
an 
effort 
to 
improve 
the 
budget 
management 
system, the 
budget projection 
for 
2003104, 
as 
contained 
in 
the 
budget 
guidelines, 
forecasts 
foreign 
inflows 
conservatively 
due 
to 
unconfirmed 
donor 
commitment. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
uncertainty in 
foreign 
financing, all 
MDAs, 
Regions and 
Local 
Authorities 
have 
been instructed, 
via 
the 
Budget 
Guidelines,  to 
prepare 
their 
budgets 
in 
two 
scenarios. 
The 
first 
scenario 
is 
to 
be 
based 
on 
the 
allocations provided 
in 
the 
budget 
guideline 
2003/04 
-2005106 
issued 
in 
December 
2002. 
The 
second 
scenario 
is 
to 
assume 
expenditure 
cuts 
of 
10 
percent 
of 
other 
charges owing to 
shortfall 
in 
resources. 
40. 
Given 
imbalances 
in 
the 
allocation 
of resources 
among 
regions, 
there 
is 
a 
clear need 
to 
ensure 
regional 
equality. 
Beginning 
2003/04 
efforts 
will 
be 
made 
to 
allocate 
resources 
albeit 
incrementally having 
regard 
to 
the 
need 
for 
equalization 
and  considering 
the 
different 
levels  of 
poverty  incidences 
in  the 
regions. 
However  a 
more 
comprehensive 
method 
that 
will 
be based 
on 
objective 
criteria will be 
developed 
after a 
study, 
to 
be 
commissioned 
for 
that purpose. 
The 
government 
is 
also 
in 
the 
process 
of 
consolidating 
fiscal 
accounts 
of 
the 
central 
government 
with 
those 
of 
the 
Local 
government 
authorities 
in 
order 
to 
capture the 
consolidated 
impact 
of 
general 
government 
operations on 
the 
economy. 
F. 
IMPROVED 
PERFORMANCE 
OF 
THE 
PUBLIC 
SECTOR 
AND 
THE 
OVERALL 
INCENTIVE 
ENVIRONMENT 
41. 
The 
Government 
is 
committed to 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Public 
Service 
Reform 
Programme 
(PSRP). 
To 
this effect, 
we 
have 
commenced 
a 
process 
of 
strategic 
planning 
in 
MDAs 
with a 
view 
to 
align their objectives 
for 
service 
improvements with 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
PRS. 
We 
continue 
to 
devolve 
more 
functions 
to 
local 
governments 
and 
communities 
and to 
promote 
a pluralistic approach 
to 
the 
provision 
of 
services. 
We 
have established 
sixteen executive 
agencies; four 
MOAS 
have 
access 
to 
the 
Selected 
Accelerated 
Salary 
Enhancement 
(SASE) 
Scheme  and  are 
approved 
for 
the 
use 
of 
OPRAS. 
The 
Civil 
Service 
Department, 
Ministry 
of 
Health, Ministry 
of 
Finance 
and 
President's 
Office Planning 
and 
Privatisation and seven 
other ministries 
have 
developed 
performance 
agreements 
with 
staff. 
Furthermore,  a 
central 
database 
of 
all 
public 
servants 
has 
been 
updated, allowing 
improvement 
in 
payroll 
control. 
76 
Page  87
42. 
The 
strategic 
theme 
of 
the 
current 
phase 
of 
the 
PSRP 
continues to 
be 
the 
delivery 
of 
quality 
public 
services 
and 
capacity 
building 
of 
the 
public 
service. 
During 
2003104 
- 
2005106, 
the Civil 
Service 
Department  will 
continue  with 
the 
installation 
of 
the 
Performance 
Management System 
in 
MDAs 
and 
Executive 
Agencies; 
improvement 
of 
record 
management 
systems 
in 
five  ministries; 
establishment 
of 
units responsible for  Monitoring and 
evaluation 
in 
five 
ministries; 
and 
strengthening 
capacity 
of 
Tanzania’s  Global 
Distance 
Learning 
Centre 
through 
linkage 
with 
other 
learning 
centre. 
43. 
In 
the 
medium term,  the  Civil 
Service 
Department 
will 
also 
provide 
support 
required 
to 
facilitate  contracting  out 
of 
non-core 
activities 
to 
the 
private 
sector 
in 
four  MDAs 
including 
Ministry  of 
Agriculture 
and 
Food 
Security, 
President’s 
Office, 
Planning 
and 
Privatisation, 
Ministry 
of 
Community 
Development 
Gender 
and 
Children, the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
and 
two 
Regional 
hospitals. 
44. 
Pay 
reform 
policy 
involves 
enhancing 
public servants’ salaries 
to 
the 
levels consistent 
with 
market 
rates 
with 
the 
aims 
of 
ensuring 
satisfactory performance, 
motivation 
and 
productivity. 
In 
this 
regard, 
during  fiscal  year 
2002/03, 
the 
Government 
adopted  a  wage-bill 
ceiling 
of Tsh. 
41 
1 
billion.  This 
amount 
is 
16 
percent higher 
than 
FY 
2001/02 
levels, 
it 
is 
at 
4.4 
percent 
of 
GDP 
and 
33.76 percent 
of 
the 
projected 
Government domestic 
revenue. 
As 
such, 
the 
agreed 
PRSC 
1 
prior 
action: 
Pay 
enhancement 
for 
civil 
servants 
in line with the approved 
budget 
for 
FY03 
has been 
implemented 
since 
July 
2002 
as 
well 
as 
undertaking 
review 
of 
schemes 
of 
service 
and 
salary 
structure 
to 
conform 
with 
implementation of 
medium term 
pay 
policy. 
The wage 
bill 
to 
GDP 
ratio 
is 
projected 
to 
increase 
from 
4.5 
percent 
in 
2003104 
to 
4.7 
percent in 
2005/06. 
The 
projected 
wage 
bill 
is 
expected 
to 
cover 
all 
normal 
PE 
adjustments, salary 
enhancement 
and 
new recruitment. 
The  latter,  particularly 
in 
priority  sectors, 
is 
important 
in  order 
to 
facilitate 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
PRS 
targets. 
45. 
In 
order 
to 
promote  a  social 
pact 
between 
public  service 
providers  and  receivers,  the 
Government 
has,  since 
year 
2000, 
initiated 
a comprehensive 
process 
of 
preparing 
and 
adopting 
Client 
Page  88
Service 
Charters 
by 
all 
Ministries. 
To 
date  twelve 
ministries 
and 
three 
executive 
agencies 
have launched their  respective 
Charters. 
These 
specify 
standards 
of 
sewice 
delivery 
and 
set 
out 
complaint 
handling 
and 
feedback 
mechanisms. 
The  initiative 
has 
strong 
impetus 
in 
improving 
the  quality 
of 
public 
service delivery, 
regular 
monitoring, evaluation 
and 
publication 
of 
results. 
It 
will 
also 
have 
a 
significant 
impact in 
helping 
to 
raise 
the standards of services 
and 
the 
expectations 
of 
customers, 
as 
well 
as 
raise 
awareness 
of 
the need for 
accountability, 
The 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
system 
that has been 
developed 
for 
the 
PSRP 
will 
be 
the  supporting instrument 
for 
this 
process. 
G. 
MINIMISATION 
OF 
RESOURCE 
LEAKAGES 
AND 
THE 
STRENGTHENING 
OF 
ACCOUNTABILITY 
i) 
Public 
Financial 
Management 
46. 
effective 
and 
sustainable 
management 
system 
of 
public 
funds. 
An 
agreed 
PRSC 
1 
prior 
action has 
been: 
This 
has 
been 
completed in 
March 
2003. 
The 
overall system 
for 
public  management  is 
designed to 
ensure that  there 
is 
amongst 
others, 
minimization 
of 
resource leakages. 
Towards 
this 
end, 
the 
Government 
has 
put 
in 
place 
the 
Integrated Financial Management 
System  (IFMS). 
Under 
IFMS 
all 
Government 
Payments 
are 
centralized 
and 
payable 
at 
one 
single 
Central 
Payment 
Office. 
For 
upcountry 
stations, 
payments 
are 
centralized 
at 
the  Regional 
Sub 
Treasury 
. 
The 
Government is 
committed 
towards the establishment 
of 
an 
Approval 
by 
GOT 
of 
the revised 
PFMRP 
which 
includes 
the 
key 
agreed 
recommendations 
of 
the 
CFAA. 
47. 
This 
arrangement 
allows 
for 
maximum  monitoring  of 
all 
payments 
initiated 
by 
MDAs 
at 
any 
given time.  Further, 
the 
IFMS 
has 
an 
in-built audit 
trail 
facility 
which 
enables tracking 
of 
all users 
of 
the 
system. 
This 
acts 
as 
a 
deterrent 
to 
would 
-be 
resource 
misappropriators. 
In 
addition, 
the 
system 
has 
a 
facility 
that controls 
payments  according 
to 
commitments  already 
entered,  commonly 
known 
as 
the 
commitment 
control. 
Under 
this 
facility 
an 
MDA 
cannot 
use resources 
that 
are 
already 
committed. 
Also, 
an 
MDA 
cannot 
effect 
payment 
in 
excess 
of 
a commitment.  Funds 
issued 
to 
MOAS 
78 
Page  89
are 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
Accounting 
Officer 
concerned. 
Under the 
Public 
Finance 
Act 
2001, 
each Accounting 
Officer 
is 
responsible 
and 
accountable for 
the 
expenditure 
of 
money 
applied 
in 
respect 
of 
their 
particular MDA. 
ii) 
Reduction 
of 
corruption 
48. 
Consistent 
with 
the 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy, 
the 
Government 
has 
continued 
to 
make 
progress 
in the  promotion 
of 
good 
governance, 
including 
the 
implementation 
of 
the National 
Anti- 
corruption 
Strategy 
and 
sectoral 
action 
plans 
(NACSAP) 
of 
Ministries, Independent Departments and 
Agencies. 
In 
this regard 
the 
second quarterly 
report 
on 
the 
implementation 
of 
NACSAP 
is 
ready 
and 
it 
is 
currently 
in 
the 
process of 
being 
published. 
49. 
Various 
other 
reform  programmes 
in  the 
area 
of  good 
governance 
are 
ongoing, 
progress 
of 
which 
will 
be presented 
in 
final 
2002 
PRS 
progress 
report. 
To 
provide 
a 
solid basis 
for 
these 
reforms 
the Commission for 
Human 
Rights and 
Good 
Governance 
has 
been 
established and 
is 
now 
fully 
operational. 
The 
establishment 
of 
this 
commission 
is 
a 
milestone 
in 
ensuring 
administrative 
justice which 
is 
greatly. 
expected 
to 
contribute  towards 
the 
promotion  of 
good 
governance 
in 
the 
country. 
iii) 
Improvements 
in 
development 
aid 
management 
50. 
Over 
the 
medium term, 
the 
Government 
aims 
to minimize 
the 
transactions 
costs 
of 
delivery 
and 
utilization 
of 
external assistance. 
Progress 
towards 
this 
aim 
is 
on 
track 
under the 
Tanzania 
Assistance 
Strategy 
(TAS). 
Substantial achievements 
have 
been 
made 
in 
this 
regard, 
including 
the 
publication 
of 
the 
TAS 
and 
formulation 
of 
a 
joint 
“roadmap” 
for its 
implementation 
(the 
TAS Action 
Plan) 
in 
the 
short 
and 
medium 
term. 
Issues 
for improving 
financial 
management 
of 
aid 
flows are also 
addressed 
in 
the 
Public 
Financial 
Management Reform 
Programme 
(PFMRP). 
Improved financial 
management 
of 
aid 
flows 
is 
one 
of 
the 
key 
elements 
in 
improving 
aid 
management. 
International initiatives 
such 
as the 
NEPAD, OECD-DAC 
Task Force 
on 
Donor  Practices, 
and 
the  MDA 
Harmonisation 
Initiatives 
will 
support 
Tanzania’s 
efforts 
to  reduce 
the  transaction 
costs 
of  aid 
delivery. 
This 
issue is important and 
will  be 
addressed 
gradually 
through consultations 
with our Development Partners 
and 
through 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
TAS. 
79 
Page  90
51. 
In 
order 
to 
aid 
fiscal 
planning,  consolidated 
projections 
of 
external 
resource 
flows 
are 
collected 
regularly 
and 
used 
in 
preparations 
of 
deliberating 
the 
cash 
management 
system 
as well as 
in budget 
preparation. 
Furthermore, 
in 
order 
to 
keep 
track 
of 
project 
assistance, a 
system 
has 
been 
implemented for 
MDAs to report to 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
on 
levels 
of 
direct 
external 
assistance 
budgeted 
and disbursed. 
H. 
ENVIRONMENTAL 
SUSTAINABILITY 
52. 
The 
underlying 
thrust 
of 
the 
objectives 
as 
laid 
out 
in 
the 
Vision 
2025 
(1999) 
is 
to 
attain 
sustainable 
development 
of 
the 
country's 
people. 
The 
Government 
therefore 
recognizes 
that  there  are 
important 
implications 
for 
environmental 
policy. 
53. 
The 
Rural 
Development 
Strategy  (RDS) 
(2001) 
gives 
a 
very 
high 
priority 
to 
poverty reduction 
issues, 
and 
emphasizes 
that rural 
poverty has a major impact on the 
sustainable 
utilization 
of 
natural 
resources.  Natural 
resource 
management 
is 
identified 
as 
a strategic 
priority area, with 
the 
development 
objective 
of 
ensuring 
sustainable 
livelihoods 
and utilization of natural 
resources for 
the benefit 
of 
the 
rural and 
urban 
population. 
Similarly, 
pro-poor 
tourism development, 
sustained 
management 
and 
utilization 
of 
fish 
and 
forest resources 
for 
the  benefit 
of 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
rural 
and 
urban 
people, 
and 
the 
exploitation 
of 
wildlife 
to contribute to 
the 
welfare 
of 
the 
surrounding 
communities are 
all 
priority activities 
for 
the 
RDS, 
thereby 
ensuring 
that linkages 
are 
made 
between 
poverty reduction 
and 
environmental 
policies. 
In 
addition, 
the 
ASDP 
(2002) 
also 
acknowledges  the 
importance 
of 
sustainable 
natural 
resource 
management 
and 
environmental management 
is 
identified 
as 
an 
important 
cross-cutting 
issue 
at 
both national 
and 
local 
government levels. 
54. 
The 
Government 
has 
initiated 
a 
process 
towards 
enhancing the 
understanding 
of 
the 
linkages between 
poverty 
and 
the 
environment, 
in order to 
better 
inform 
policy 
making.  These 
efforts 
have 
resulted 
in 
the following 
accomplishments: 
Completion of an analysis 
of 
options for 
a 
preferred institutional 
framework 
for 
environmental 
management;

CONCLUSION 
56. 
The 
Government is committed 
to the 
goal 
of 
reducing 
poverty 
as 
encompassed 
by 
the 
overall Poverty 
Reduction Strategy 
and 
the 
agreed 
policy 
actions 
laid  out 
in 
the 
PRBSIPRSC 
Performance 
Assessment 
Framework. 
However, 
the 
total 
resources 
available 
to 
Government 
are 
insufficient 
to 
implement poverty-reducing 
policies. 
While 
efforts 
are 
in 
place 
to raise 
the 
domestic 
revenue 
to 
GDP 
ratio, 
time 
is 
needed 
firstly 
to 
expand 
the 
revenue 
base 
from 
a 
higher 
growth 
rate 
of 
the 
economy 
and 
secondly 
to 
observe 
tangible results 
from 
those policy 
actions 
implemented 
to 
raise 
revenue. 
In 
light 
of 
these factors, 
the 
Government 
views 
the 
support 
from 
IDA 
through 
the 
proposed 
PRSCI, 
as 
a 
crucial 
part 
of 
your 
institution’s 
support 
in 
the 
effort 
to 
reduce 
poverty. 
Yours 
sincerely,

Notes: 
For 
the 
first 
annual 
cycle, 
all 
actions 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
Performance 
Assessment 
Framework (PAF) 
for 
PREWPRSC 
1, 
including 
the 
Prior 
Actions 
(in 
bold) 
for 
PRSC 
1 
will 
have 
had 
to 
be 
completed 
no 
later 
than 
March 
2003. 
For 
the 
following 
two 
years, 
the 
Indicative Prior 
Actions 
for 
PRSC2 
(in 
bold) 
and 
those 
Prior 
Actions 
subsequently 
identified for 
PRSC 
3, 
will 
have 
to 
be 
fully 
accomplished/completed 
by 
March 
2004 
and 
March 
2005, 
respectively, 
in 
order 
for 
successful 
negotiations 
and 
subsequent 
presentation 
of 
the 
relevant 
PRSC  operation 
to 
the 
World 
Bank’s 
Board 
of 
Directors. 
All 
other  Actions, 
would 
have 
had 
to 
be 
completed 
by 
no 
later than 
November, 
2003 
(PRBSPRSC 
2) 
and November, 
2004 
(PRBS/PRSC 
3). 
Substantive  progress 
on 
the 
full 
set 
of 
actions 
is 
recognized 
as 
vital 
for 
continuation 
of 
the 
overall 
program 
of 
support 
to 
Tanzania. 
A 
broad-based 
review 
of 
the 
PAF 
Actions 
will 
be 
conducted 
in

Main 
principles 
1) 
The 
Government 
and 
the 
donors consider the Partnership 
Framework22 
(PF) 
for 
budget 
suppod3 
as 
the 
common 
instrument 
of 
support 
to 
the 
Poverty Reduction 
Strategy 
(PRS) 
through 
the 
Government’s 
budget. 
The 
PF 
is 
an 
integral part 
of 
the 
Government 
of 
Tanzania’s 
public 
sector 
budgeting and 
priority 
setting 
process 
and 
the 
PRS. 
The 
budget 
will 
be 
used 
as 
a 
tool to 
reach 
the 
PRS objectives, 
and 
priority 
sectors 
as 
defined 
in 
the 
PRS 
will 
be 
protected 
in 
the 
budget. 
The 
agreed 
priority 
allocations 
as 
well 
as 
indicators 
of 
achievements 
will 
continue 
to 
be 
monitored 
through 
joint 
processes 
including 
the 
Public 
Expenditure 
Review 
(PER) and PRS 
process 
and 
reviews 
as 
detailed 
in 
this 
PF. 
These 
joint 
processes 
will 
involve 
the 
Government 
and 
the

2) 
This 
PF 
Memorandum 
describes 
the 
common 
framework 
for 
the 
development 
grant  and 
loan 
agreements 
to 
fund 
poverty-oriented 
programme 
budget 
support 
to 
Tanzania. 
Together 
with 
the 
attached 
Technical 
Annexes, 
it 
replaces 
the 
Memorandum 
of 
Understanding 
for 
the 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Budget 
Support 
(PRBS) 
signed 
on 
27‘” 
November 
2001 
and 
the 
Technical 
Note 
of 
October 
2001. 
This 
Performance 
Framework 
Memorandum 
has 
been 
reviewed 
and 
agreed 
by 
the 
Government and 
the 
PF 
donors 
during 
the 
joint 
Annual 
Review/pre-appraisal 
of 
general 
budget 
support 
carried out 
in 
November 
2002. 
3) 
The 
PF 
Memorandum 
will 
be 
supplemented 
by 
bilateral 
agreements 
between 
each 
individual 
donor 
and 
the 
Government 
of 
Tanzania, 
and 
by 
a 
PRSC 
programme document 
and 
related legal 
documents 
of 
the 
World 
Bank. 
The 
bilateral 
agreements 
will 
have 
the 
choice 
to 
focus 
on 
all 
or 
a subset 
of 
the 
actions 
and 
targets 
in 
the 
list 
of 
policy 
actions 
and targets 
jointly 
agreed 
on 
in 
the 
PAF. 
It 
is 
understood 
by 
the 
parties 
that 
the 
contents 
in 
the 
individual 
funding 
agreements take 
legal 
precedence 
over 
this 
Partnership 
Framework 
Memorandum. 
However, 
it 
is 
the 
intention 
of 
the 
parties 
to 
establish 
funding 
agreements 
that 
are 
compatible 
with 
the 
provisions 
of 
this 
Partnership 
Framework Memorandum. 
4) 
The 
intention 
is 
to 
manage 
existing 
and 
future 
budgetary 
support 
from 
donors  and 
financing 
institutions through 
the 
PF 
facility. 
The 
objectives 
are 
to 
minimize 
transaction 
costs, 
to 
harmonize 
performance 
benchmarks  and 
dialogue 
between 
the 
parties 
and 
to 
link 
funding 
commitments 
by 
the 
donors 
to 
achievement 
of 
targets 
set. 
The 
Partnership 
Framework 
and 
the 
funding 
Facility 
is 
therefore 
open 
for 
contribution 
from 
and 
participation 
by 
all 
donors 
and 
financial 
institutions that 
are 
providing 
or 
considering 
providing 
such 
budgetary 
support. 
5) 
The 
PF 
aims at  increasing 
the 
predictability 
of 
donor 
flows. 
This 
will 
benefit overall 
economic 
developments and 
the 
implementation 
and 
efficiency 
of 
programmes 
in 
priority 
sectors. 
The 
PF facility 
will 
provide 
general 
budget 
support 
co-ordinated among 
the 
participating 
donors and operated 
according 
to 
established 
government 
procedures and 
reporting 
requirements 
agreed 
with 
the 
partners. 
2. 
Justification 
6) 
Tanzania 
has 
implemented an 
economic 
reform 
programme 
that 
has 
shown 
a 
number 
of 
positive 
results. 
Significant 
progress 
has 
been 
made 
in 
macroeconomic stabilisation 
and 
structural 
reform 
of 
the 
22 
The 
Partnership 
Framework 
is 
the 
name 
given 
to 
the 
harmonised 
PRBS and 
PRSC 
budget 
support 
framework. 
23 
The 
term 
“Budget 
Support” 
as 
used 
to 
denote 
both 
budget 
and 
other 
similar 
support 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
PF 
Memorandum.

economy. 
Inflation 
has 
stabilised 
below 
5 
percent 
and 
signs 
are 
that 
many 
of 
the 
elements 
required 
for 
a 
private 
sector 
led 
growth 
are 
in 
place. 
7) 
In 
the 
first 
years 
of 
the 
reform 
programme, 
growth 
rates 
in 
the 
economy 
were 
slow 
to 
pick 
up, 
however, and 
this 
led 
to 
lack 
of 
progress 
in 
poverty 
reduction 
and 
slow 
development 
of 
the 
economic 
base 
needed 
to 
support 
the 
public 
sector. 
Growth 
rates 
in 
the 
economy 
have 
improved 
in 
recent 
years, 
but 
poverty 
is 
still 
prevalent. 
It 
has 
been 
estimated 
that 
about one 
third 
of 
the 
population 
cannot 
afford 
basic 
needs 
for 
livelihood. 
As 
many 
as 
18 
percent 
are 
living 
in 
abject poverty, 
that 
is, 
in 
a 
situation 
where 
the 
income 
is 
insufficient 
to 
buy 
food 
to 
cover 
minimum 
nutritional 
needs. 
Tanzania 
needs 
several years 
of 
high 
per 
capita 
growth 
rates 
to 
reduce 
poverty 
levels 
significantly. 
8) 
Surveys 
of 
poverty 
and 
living 
conditions 
in 
Tanzania 
show 
that 
there 
are 
important 
challenges 
in 
the 
priority 
sectors 
that 
are 
detailed 
in 
the 
PRS.  These 
priority 
sectors 
(and 
priority 
items) 
may 
be 
subject 
to 
change 
during 
the 
ongoing 
process 
of 
reviewing 
and 
updating 
the 
PRS, 
but 
they 
currently 
include: 
health 
(primary); 
education 
(basic); 
water;  roads (rural); 
agriculture  (extension 
services); 
justice 
and 
HIV/ 
AIDS. 
There 
is 
furthermore 
a serious 
concern 
about 
the 
possibility 
of 
large 
segments 
of 
the 
population 
being 
left 
out 
of 
the economic 
growth 
and income generation 
process. 
In 
recognition 
of 
the 
enormous 
challenge 
in 
combating poverty 
the 
Government 
of 
the 
United 
Republic 
of 
Tanzania 
has 
refocused 
priorities 
towards  social 
sectors 
and 
primary 
services 
within 
them. 
Long-term 
targets 
for 
poverty  reduction 
were  articulated 
in 
the 
Vision 
2025  and  elaborated 
further 
in 
National 
Poverty 
Eradication 
Strategy 
(NPES) 
adopted 
by 
the 
Government 
in 
November 
1997. 
The 
Tanzania 
Assistance 
Strategy 
(TAS), 
which 
expresses 
the 
modalities 
and 
coordination 
requirements 
for 
donor 
support 
and 
the PRS focus 
on 
how 
to 
combat 
poverty 
in 
an 
effective 
manner, 
both 
in 
terms 
of 
more 
effective 
use 
of 
public 
resources 
and 
in 
improving 
the 
possibilities 
for 
economic  growth, 
employment 
creation 
and 
income 
generation. 
9) 
Domestic 
revenue 
to 
the 
public 
sector 
in 
Tanzania 
was 
12, 
2 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
the 
2001/02 budget 
year. 
The 
fiscal deficit 
before 
grants was 
6,6 
percent. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
reforms 
carried 
out 
in 
tax 
policy 
and administration,  the Government 
recognizes 
that more 
measures are 
needed 
to 
enhance 
domestic 
resource 
mobilization. 
However, 
a 
realistic 
assessment 
is 
that 
the 
tax 
base, 
which 
is 
the 
monetized, 
non- 
governmental 
part 
of 
the 
economy, 
needs 
to 
grow 
faster 
than 
overall 
GDP 
for 
a 
number 
of 
years 
to 
yield 
a 
significantly 
higher 
tax/GDP 
ratio. 
While 
efforts 
to 
increase  revenue 
mobilisation 
are 
being 
implemented, 
the 
poverty 
reduction 
programme 
is 
in 
need 
of 
external 
grants 
or 
other  concessional 
financing. 
Direct 
budget 
support 
provides 
a  sustainable 
route 
to 
manage 
the  transition 
from 
aid 
dependency. 
It 
strengthens 
national 
ownership 
of 
the 
development 
process 
as 
well 
as 
Government 
institutions, 
and 
it 
facilitates 
the 
implementation 
of 
democratically 
selected sector strategies 
for 
growth 
and 
poverty 
reduction.

3. 
The 
Performance 
Assessment 
Framework 
IO) 
The 
PF 
is 
linked 
to 
a 
common 
set 
of 
policy 
and 
poverty reduction 
goals. 
These 
goals are agreed 
between 
the 
Government 
of 
Tanzania and 
the 
participating 
donors and 
shall 
be 
based 
on 
the 
goals 
of 
the 
PRS. 
The 
goals, 
including 
the 
policies 
to 
reach 
them 
and 
the 
indicators 
to 
monitor 
them, 
are 
described 
in 
a 
Performance 
Assessment 
Framework 
(PAF)24. 
It 
is 
the 
intention 
of 
the 
parties 
to 
harmonize the PRS 
action 
plan 
and 
the 
PAF 
completely 
within 
three 
years. 
11) 
The 
PAF 
is 
a 
results-oriented 
matrix 
of 
agreed actions 
and  indicators 
including 
timeframe 
for 
reaching 
targets. 
The 
PAF 
sets 
out 
agreed 
key 
short and 
medium 
term 
actions 
to 
reduce 
poverty 
such 
as 
macroeconomic 
stability 
and 
performance  improvements 
in 
the 
public 
sector 
together 
with 
specific 
annual  measures 
to 
be 
taken 
by 
the 
Government 
to 
achieve 
the 
PRS 
targets. 
The 
indicators 
for 
the 
macroeconomic 
targets 
of 
the 
PAF 
will 
be 
those  elaborated 
in 
the 
IMF 
programme 
framework 
discussions. 
Dialogue 
on 
these 
issues 
with 
a 
wider 
groups 
of 
stakeholders 
will 
be 
handled 
in 
the 
appropriate 
common 
forum 
e.g. 
the 
PER 
macroeconomic 
group. 
The 
PF 
parties 
will 
avoid introducing 
new 
targets, 
indicators 
or 
measures 
that 
are 
outside 
the 
PAF 
and 
the 
IMF 
programme macroeconomic 
framework. 
12) 
The 
parties 
will 
use 
the 
PAF 
and 
PRS 
Review 
process 
as 
a 
tool 
for 
dialogue 
on 
PRS 
implementation 
and 
progress 
on 
PRS 
implementation 
and 
PAF 
actions 
will 
help 
to 
determine 
appropriate 
levels 
of 
future 
funding 
for 
the 
General 
Budget. 
Through 
a 
continuous 
process, 
it 
will 
allow 
the 
Government 
and 
the 
Donors 
to 
assess 
progress 
towards 
agreed 
medium 
term 
objectives 
and 
the 
implementation 
status 
of 
specific 
measures. 
The 
PAF 
will 
be 
updated 
annually 
as 
part 
of 
the 
Annual 
Review 
process. 
4. 
Review 
Process 
13) 
The 
review 
process 
for 
PF 
will 
be 
common 
for 
all 
participating 
donors and 
based 
on 
the 
review 
process 
for 
the 
PRS. 
The 
Government 
of 
Tanzania and 
the 
donors 
participating 
will 
maintain 
a close 
dialogue 
regarding the 
PF. 
The 
parties shall 
meet 
on 
an agreed schedule 
to 
review 
implementation 
and 
the 
attainment 
of 
objectives 
(see 
Appendix). 
The 
PAF 
matrix 
and PRS 
Progress 
Report 
will 
form 
the 
basis 
for 
discussions 
on 
progress 
between 
PF donors 
and 
the 
Government. 
14) 
The 
timing 
of 
review 
meetings 
through 
the 
year 
will 
be 
decided 
in 
such a 
way 
that the 
budget 
process 
is 
facilitated 
and that 
the 
PRSC requirements 
and 
the 
bilateral 
donors’ 
need 
for 
inputs 
to 
their 
decision-making 
processes 
are 
accommodated. 
The 
table 
in 
the 
Appendix 
lists 
the 
meetings 
and 
actions 
needed. 
15) 
Assessment 
of 
performance 
will 
be 
based 
on 
progress 
towards 
targets 
and 
measures 
identified 
through 
the 
PRS 
and 
expressed 
in 
the 
PAF 
matrix. 
Joint reviews 
of 
the 
PF 
Facility 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
by 
Government 
and 
all 
participating 
contributors. 
These 
reviews 
will 
use 
information 
gathered 
through 
ongoing 
processes 
to 
ensure 
that 
they 
do 
not 
set 
up 
a 
parallel 
review 
process. 
The 
review 
processes 
should 
endeavour 
to 
minimize 
additional technical 
work. 
However,  should 
the 
quality 
of 
regular 
information 
prove 
not 
to 
be satisfactory, 
the 
PF 
donors 
and 
the 
Government 
will 
agree 
on 
a 
timeframe 
and 
on 
the 
possible support 
donors 
could 
offer 
to 
build 
the 
capacity 
needed 
to 
provide 
this 
information. 
16) 
The 
review 
processes 
will 
draw 
together 
summary reports 
reviewing 
progress against 
relevant 
PAF 
and 
PRS 
targets. 
Progress against 
the 
list 
of 
indicators 
of 
social 
well-being, 
derived 
from 
the 
PRS 
and 
attached 
to 
the 
PAF 
matrix, should 
be 
covered 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
PRS 
and discussed 
as 
part 
of 
the

The 
PAF

Government 
of 
Tanzania 
and 
facilitating 
implementation

statutory 
provisions 
including 
individual 
bilateral 
funding 
agreements 
with 
Tanzania, 
which 
ultimately 
govern decisions 
on

commit 
themselves 
to: 
provide 
information 
on 
future 
disbursements 
in 
advance 
of 
the 
budget 
year 
in 
a 
common 
financial 
framework 
for 
PF; 
disburse 
all 
of 
the 
commitments 
made 
within 
the Tanzanian budget

and 
attempt, 
where 
possible, 
to 
front 
load 
their

within 
the 
first 
quarter; 
as 
a 
general 
rule, 
change

for 
review 
meetings 
will 
be 
determined 
by 
taking 
into 
account 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
Tanzanian 
budget 
and 
by 
the 
presentation 
of 
the annual 
PRS 
report. 
The 
budget 
year 
is 
from 
1st 
of 
July 
to 
30th 
of 
June. 
The 
Annual Review 
process 
of 
updating 
the 
PAF 
targets 
will 
involve 
focused 
technical 
working 
groups 
for 
each 
area 
of 
the 
PAF. 
Each 
of 
these 
groups 
will 
comprise 
Government representatives, 
PRBS 
donor 
representatives 
and 
World 
Bank 
representatives. 
They 
will 
jointly 
review 
progress 
and 
priorities 
for 
the 
future.

final 
joint 
meeting 
involving 
all 
working 
groups 
will 
then 
be 
held to 
agree 
on 
key 
findings 
of 
the 
reviews 
and 
the 
way 
forward. 
The 
Mid-year 
Review 
will 
involve 
similar 
processes, 
but 
will 
be 
a 
light 
review 
of 
progress 
to 
date.  The 
Ministry 
of 
Finance, 
in 
close 
coordination 
with 
the 
Vice 
President's 
Office 
will 
maintain 
oversight 
of 
the 
Review 
process 
and 
coordinate inputs 
where necessary 
from 
other Government 
departments.

Ministry 
of 
Finance, the 
Technical 
Committee 
will 
act 
as 
the 
main 
point 
of 
contact; 
they 
will 
co-ordinate 
preparation 
of 
the 
necessary 
Government 
assessments 
of 
progress 
and 
provide 
the 
information 
as 
outlined 
in 
Paragraph 
17; 
and

Audit 
Arrangements 
The 
following 
audit 
arrangements 
shall 
be 
established: 
1) 
The 
National 
Audit 
Office 
(NAO) 
carries 
out 
an 
independent 
annual  external 
audit 
of 
the 
Government 
Accounts. 
The 
annual 
audit report 
by 
the 
NAO 
shall 
be 
presented 
to 
PRBS 
donors 
as 
soon 
as 
it 
becomes available; 
Given 
the 
current 
considerable 
time 
lag 
between 
the 
end 
of 
the 
fiscal 
year 
and 
the 
availability 
of 
the 
annual 
NAO 
audit report 
for 
that 
fiscal 
year, 
a 
more 
timely 
audit 
of 
seZectedJlows 
in 
the 
Government Accounts 
would 
be 
undertaken annually. 
This 
audit 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
NAO, 
which 
may 
contract 
assistance 
from 
an 
internationally 
recognised 
audit 
company. 
This 
audit 
would 
be financed 
by 
the 
PRBS 
donors. 
The 
terms 
of 
reference 
for 
this 
selected 
external 
audit  and 
a 
short 
list 
of 
audit 
companies 
would 
be 
jointly 
prepared  and 
agreed 
by 
the 
Government, 
the 
National 
Audit 
Office 
and 
the 
PRBS 
donors. 
The 
selection 
of 
auditors and 
approval 
of 
the 
audit 
contract 
would 
be 
endorsed 
by 
the Government and 
the 
PRBS 
donors; 
3) 
Internal 
audits 
of 
the 
PFU3S 
account 
will 
be 
undertaken. 
Contributing 
donors 
may 
undertake 
an 
independent 
external 
audit 
of 
the 
PRBS 
account at 
any 
time 
at 
their 
own 
cost; 
4) 
The 
internal 
and 
external audit 
reports 
will 
be 
discussed 
as 
part 
of 
the 
reviews 
(ref.:

The  technical 
arrangements 
and 
the 
steps 
to  follow 
in 
respect 
to 
the 
IDA 
Credit 
and 
Grant 
administration 
are described 
below: 
1. 
Borrower and Credit 
Amount. 
The 
Borrower 
is 
the 
United 
Republic 
of 
Tanzania. 
A 
single- 
tranche 
Credit 
of 
SDR 
73 
million 
(US$lOO 
million 
equivalent) 
would 
be 
made 
available 
upon 
credit 
effectiveness, 
anticipated 
for 
July 
2003. 
The closing 
date 
of 
the 
Credit 
would 
be 
June 
30, 
2004. 
It 
is 
envisaged 
that over 
the 
next 
two 
years, 
there 
will 
be 
two 
further 
single-tranche 
annual 
PRSCs 
to 
support 
the

Additionally, 
there 
would 
be 
a 
grant 
of 
SDR

(US$32

3. 
The 
proposed 
financial

4. 
Disbursement, 
Reporting and 
Auditing 
 arrangement^.^' 
The 
operation 
will 
follow 
IDA’s 
simplified 
disbursement procedures 
for 
adjustment operations.26 
Accordingly, 
the 
PRSC 
1 
proceeds 
will 
be 
disbursed 
in 
compliance 
with 
the 
stipulated 
single 
tranche 
release 
conditions. 
Disbursement 
will 
not 
be 
linked 
to 
any 
specific 
purchases 
and 
no 
procurement 
requirements 
will 
be 
needed. 
Once 
the 
operation 
is 
approved 
by 
the 
Board, the 
Borrower 
will 
open and 
maintain 
a dedicated deposit account 
in 
US 
Dollars 
for 
the 
Borrower’s 
use. 
As 
the 
single 
tranche 
is 
released 
on 
PRSCl 
effectiveness, 
IDA 
will 
disburse 
the 
proceeds 
of 
the 
credit 
and grant 
into 
the 
deposit 
account.  Thereafter,  at 
the 
request 
of 
the 
MoF, 
the 
US 
Dollars 
amount 
will 
be 
converted 
to 
Tanzania 
Shillings 
at 
the 
Bank 
of 
Tanzania 
(BOT) 
for 
the 
credit 
of 
the 
Government 
account 
(Consolidated 
Fund 
Account) 
to 
be 
used 
subsequently 
for 
public 
expenditures. 
If 
after 
deposit 
in 
the 
deposit account 
the 
proceeds 
of 
the 
Credit 
and 
Grant 
or 
any 
parts 
thereof 
are 
used 
for 
ineligible 
purposes, 
as 
defined 
in 
the 
Development 
Financing 
Agreement, 
IDA 
will 
require 
the 
Borrower to 
either: 
(i) 
return 
that amount 
to 
the 
deposit account 
for 
use 
for 
eligible 
purposes, 
or 
(ii) 
refund 
the amount 
directly 
to 
IDA. 
5. 
Through MoF, 
the 
Borrower 
will: 
(i) 
report 
the exact 
sum 
received 
into 
the 
deposit 
account; 
(ii) 
indicate 
to 
IDA 
details 
of 
the 
Consolidated 
Fund 
Account 
to 
which 
the 
Tanzania 
Shillings 
equivalent 
of 
the 
Credit 
& 
Grant 
proceeds 
will 
be 
credited; 
(iii) 
ensure 
that 
all 
withdrawals 
from 
the 
deposit 
account 
are 
for 
budgeted 
public 
expenditures except 
for 
purposes such 
as 
military 
expenditures 
or for 
other 
items 
on 
IDA’s 
negative 
list; 
(iv) 
report 
to 
IDA 
the 
equivalent 
in 
the 
local 
currency 
of 
the 
US$ 
amount 
withdrawn 
from 
the 
deposit 
account 
producing 
evidence 
that 
the 
local 
currency 
sum 
was 
paid into 
the 
Consolidated 
Fund 
Account 
and that 
disbursements 
from 
that 
account were 
for 
budgeted 
public 
expenditures  other 
than 
those 
on 
IDA’s 
negative 
list; 
and (v) 
submit 
a 
report 
on 
receipts and 
disbursements 
for 
both 
the 
deposit  account 
and 
Consolidated 
Fund 
to 
enable 
IDA 
to  review 
the 
consistency 
of 
the 
withdrawal 
with 
the 
Development 
Financing 
Agreement and 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
operation.

The 
Country 
Financial Accountability 
Report 
(CFAA) 
on 
Tanzania 
concluded that 
the 
central 
and 
local 
government 
financial 
management 
systems 
represent 
high  fiduciary 
risk. 
The 
major 
recommendations 
contained 
in 
that 
report 
have 
been 
reflected 
in 
the 
reform 
program supported 
by 
the 
PRSC. 
To 
ensure 
effective 
implementation 
of 
the 
reform 
the 
Government 
has 
developed PFMRP, 
the 
implementation 
of 
which 
will 
be 
monitored 
under 
the 
PER 
process. 
9. 
Environmental 
Aspects. 
Mainstreaming 
of 
environment 
into 
the 
PRSC 
process 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
Vice-president's 
Office 
(VPO) 
with 
the  support 
of 
UNDP, 
the Bank, 
the 
donor 
community 
and 
other  stakeholder  groups. 
This 
builds 
on 
the 
substantial 
groundwork 
on 
the 
institutional 
framework 
already 
done. 
It 
is 
envisaged 
that the 
PRSC 
process 
will 
operationalize 
high 
priority 
activities 
already 
identified 
by 
the 
GOT 
for 
mainstreaming 
environment 
into 
the 
PRS 
beginning 
with 
PRSC2. 
These 
include Increasing 
the 
knowledge 
base 
on 
poverty 
- 
environment 
linkages 
and 
evaluation 
of 
the 
impact 
of 
PRS 
interventions 
on 
the 
environment 
and 
poverty 
and 
government 
performance 
in 
meeting 
PRS 
targets. 
The 
goal 
of 
the 
latter 
activity 
is 
to 
strengthen 
the 
existing 
Poverty 
Monitoring 
System 
through 
linking 
it 
with 
environmental 
information 
systems 
supported under 
the 
PRSC 
process. 
The 
key 
actions 
that 
will 
be 
carried out 
under 
the 
PRSC 
1 
and 
2 
cycle 
would 
include: 
(a) 
Development 
of 
targets 
which 
are 
consistent 
with 
sectoral 
and 
district 
plans 
and 
identify 
and 
agree 
on 
timelines 
and 
thresholds 
which 
will 
be 
used 
to 
evaluate 
PRS 
implementation; 
and 
(b)  Agreement on the 
action 
plan 
for 
development 
of 
an 
effective 
institutional 
framework 
for 
the 
integration 
and management 
of 
the 
poverty-environment indicators 
in 
the 
existing 
Poverty 
Monitoring 
System

Status 
of 
Public Procurement 
and Progress 
Made 
on 
the 
Procurement 
Reform 
in Mainland 
Tanzania. 
1. 
Procurement 
in 
Tanzania 
is 
in 
a 
reform 
stage 
based 
on 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
1996 
Country 
Procurement 
Assessment 
Report 
(CPAR). 
The 
Government 
enacted 
the Procurement 
Law 
in 
February 
2001 
replacing 
all 
previous procurement legislation. 
The 
Act 
became 
effective 
on 
July 
1, 
2001. 
In 
tandem, 
the  Government 
also 
issued 
the 
Regulations 
in 
two 
parts: 
(a) 
Procurement 
of 
Goods  and 
Works;  and 
(b) 
Selection and 
Employment 
of 
Consultants. 
The 
corresponding 
Regulations 
became 
effective 
on 
July 
2, 
2001. 
In 
mid 
November 
2002, 
the 
Government 
issued 
a 
set 
of 
Standard 
Bidding 
Documents 
(SBDs). 
These 
comprise: 
(a) 
Procurement 
of 
Goods 
through International 
Competitive 
Bidding; 
(b) 
Procurement 
of 
Health 
Sector 
Goods; 
(c) 
Standard 
Request 
for 
Proposal; 
(c) 
Standard 
Pre- 
qualification 
document 
for 
procurement 
of

Country 
Procurement

Bidding

The 
Public 
Procurement 
Act 
(PPA)  covers 
procurement 
in 
both 
central  government 
and 
local 
authorities, 
though 
the latter 
is 
covered 
by 
specific 
Local 
Government 
Regulations, 
to 
be 
issued 
under 
the 
Local 
Government 
Finance 
Act. 
The 
local 
government 
authority 
has 
finalized 
draft Regulations and 
Procurement 
Manual, 
which 
are 
in 
line 
with 
the 
new 
procurement 
law. 
Remarkable 
change 
in 
the 
new 
local 
government regulations 
is 
a change 
of 
composition 
of 
the 
local 
government 
authority 
tender 
board 
of 
which 
the 
councilors 
have 
been 
entirely 
removed 
from 
the 
procurement 
process. 
3. 
The 
Bank 
carried out 
another 
CPAR 
this 
year. 
The 
stakeholders 
workshop 
was 
conducted 
on 
January 
27 
- 
28, 
2003 
to 
discuss 
the 
initial 
recommendations 
proposed 
by 
the 
Consultant. 
A 
few 
recommendations 
include, 
inter 
alia; 
(a) 
To 
amend 
the 
Public 
Procurement 
Law 
to 
establish 
the 
Procurement 
Authority 
responsible 
for 
oversight 
of 
public 
procurement; 
(b) 
Execution 
of 
procurement 
to 
be 
decentralized 
to 
ministries 
and 
departments; 
(c) 
Change 
legal 
framework 
to 
include 
private 
sector 
representatives 
in 
the 
Public 
Procurement Appeals 
Authority; 
and 
(d) 
Replacement 
of 
supplies 
officers 
with 
a 
new 
cadre 
of 
procurement 
specialists 
in 
the 
civil 
services 
rating 
system. 
The 
final 
report 
including 
all 
recommendations 
agreed 
upon 
during 
the 
stake 
holders 
workshop 
will 
be 
submitted 
to 
the 
Government 
by 
end 
of 
April 
2003 
for 
implementation. 
4. 
This 
second 
assessment 
of 
the 
procurement 
system 
in 
Tanzania 
again 
looked 
at 
all 
areas 
of 
public 
procurement operations 
in 
Tanzania, 
including 
the 
legislative framework, 
the 
performance 
of 
regulatory 
functions, 
the 
enforcement 
regime, 
the capacity 
of 
public 
sector 
institutions 
to 
conduct procurement, and 
the effects 
of 
corruption 
on 
procurement. 
It 
forms 
an 
integral part 
of 
the 
World 
Bank’s 
activities 
in 
Tanzania 
as 
presented 
in 
the 
Country 
Assistance Strategy 
(CAS) 
of 
2000 
and 
serves 
a 
number 
of 
its 
key 
themes, 
particularly 
higher 
economic  growth, 
poverty reduction 
and 
institutional 
reforms 
to 
improve 
governance. 
The 
CPAR’s 
key 
findings, 
strengths 
and 
weaknesses 
are 
summarized 
below. 
Procurement 
is 
a 
neglected 
function. 
Legal 
Framework: 
Overall 
the 
legal 
fvamework 
is 
suficient 
and 
needs 
only 
minor 
amendments 
Key 
Findings, 
Strengths and 
Weaknesses 
Despite 
the 
economic 
benefits  mentioned 
above 
procurement 
has 
not 
to 
date 
been 
considered 
to 
be 
a 
core 
hnction 
of 
government, 
worthy 
of 
specialized 
staff 
and 
dedicated 
organizational units. 
The 
legal framework 
for 
public 
procurement 
in 
Tanzania 
is 
in 
transition. While 
some 
very 
important 
steps 
in 
the 
right 
direction 
have 
been 
taken 
with 
the 
introduction 
of 
the 
procurement 
Act 
in 
July 
2001, 
there 
remain 
some 
critical 
outstanding 
issues, 
particularly 
concerning 
local 
government procurement, 
access 
to complaint 
and 
dissemination 
of 
legal 
texts. 
Overall, 
and compared 
to  other  countries 
in 
the 
region, 
the 
legal 
framework 
for 
121 
Page  132
Annex 
10 
public 
procurement 
is 
updated 
and 
adequate. 
Since 
the 
introduction 
of 
the Procurement 
Act 
in 
200 
1, 
the 
prescribed Regulations 
for 
Local 
Government 
have 
been 
lacking. 
This 
has 
lead 
to 
legal 
confusion 
and 
contributed 
to 
malpractices 
throughout 
in 
local 
government. 
It 
is 
essential, 
that 
the 
Local 
Government 
Procurement 
Regulations (now available 
in 
draft) 
be 
issued 
as 
soon 
as 
possible. 
At 
present, 
aggrieved 
bidders 
have 
very 
limited 
access 
to 
a 
complaints 
mechanism. 
A 
credible complaints 
mechanism 
should 
be 
introduced 
by 
strengthening 
the 
complaints 
handling 
ability 
of 
the 
Regulatory 
Body 
and 
establishing the 
Public 
Appeals 
Authority, 
already entrenched 
in 
the 
legislation, to 
provide a functioning 
avenue 
of 
complaints 
for 
bidders. 
Local 
Government Procurement 
needs 
further  attention 
Access 
to 
complaints should 
be 
strengthened 
Proper 
application 
of 
the 
legal 
framework 
mu9t be 
ensured 
Current 
Practices: 
Abusive 
practices 
in 
public 
procurement, 
despite 
adequate 
legal 
framework. 
Publicity 
in public 
procurement 
Orpanization 
& 
Resources: 
The 
Central 
Tender 
Board 
should 
be 
reformed 
and 
hold 
only 
regulatory 
powers 
Procurement should 
be 
decentralized 
The single most 
important 
issue 
on 
the 
legal framework 
is 
the 
lack 
of 
dissemination 
and 
proper 
application 
of 
the 
rules. 
After  a period 
of 
carving 
out 
the 
new 
rules, 
the 
country 
must 
now 
focus 
on 
making 
those 
rules 
work. 
The 
knowledge 
of 
procurement 
rules 
and 
capacity 
to 
apply 
these 
rules 
is 
very poor 
in 
most 
of 
the 
procuring 
entities. 
Procurement audits 
are 
seldom 
performed 
and 
the 
consequences 
for 
breach 
of 
procurement 
rules, 
outside 
corruption 
cases, 
are 
minimal. 
As 
a 
consequence 
hereof, enforcement 
of 
the procurement 
rules 
suffers 
and 
malpractices 
in 
direct 
conflict 
with 
existing 
rules 
are 
allowed 
to 
flourish. 
Securing 
bidders 
and 
the 
public 
access 
to 
information 
is 
one 
of 
the 
cornerstones 
of 
sound 
procurement 
practices. 
Procuring 
entities 
are 
presently 
utilizing 
a 
number 
of 
different 
media 
for 
advertising 
procurement 
opportunities, 
making 
access 
to 
information 
and 
enforcement 
of 
the 
rules 
on 
advertisement 
difficult. 
A 
central 
media 
for  publication 
of 
procurement 
information, a 
Procurement 
Journal, 
should 
be 
established,  supplemented 
with 
an 
Internet information 
site. 
At 
present 
the 
Central 
Tender 
Board 
holds 
both 
executive 
and 
regulatory 
powers, 
which 
contributes 
to 
an 
unstable 
situation 
where 
the 
CTB 
on 
one 
hand 
participates 
in 
the 
procurement procedure 
and 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
monitors 
the 
same 
procedures. 
The 
executive 
role 
of 
the 
CTB 
also leads 
to 
lack 
of 
accountability 
and 
responsibility 
at 
the 
level 
of 
the 
ministerial 
tender  boards  and the 
ministerial Accounting  Officers, 
who 
are 
otherwise 
responsible 
for 
the 
budget 
but not for 
procurement under 
that body. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
the 
reform 
of 
the 
Central 
Tender 
Board, 
the 
executive functions 
of 
procurement 
should 
be 
decentralized 
to 
the 
level 
of 
ministries, 
departments, 
agencies 
and 
parastatals. 
This would 
make 
the 
accounting 
officers 
also 
responsible 
also 
for 
procurement. 
To 
support  the  decentralized 
procuring 
entities 
focus 
should 
turn 
to 
establishing/ 
strengthening procurement 
management 
units 
in 
these 
entities. 
When 
the 
CTB 
is 
reformed 
and 
becomes 
a purely regulatory authority 
it 
is 
important 
to 
ensure 
efficient information 
flow 
to 
enable 
the 
regulatory authority 
to 
monitor 
the 
entire 
procurement 
process 
on 
a 
continuous 
basis. 
Monitoring 
must 
be 
carried 
out 
at 
all 
stages 
of 
the  procurement 
process, 
from 
the 
early 
planning 
stages 
to 
contract 
management 
and 
implementation. 
The 
Government 
is 
a 
major procurer 
and 
as 
such 
must 
utilize 
the 
advantages 
in 
terms 
of 
bulk 
and 
low 
unit 
price 
procurement that 
is 
associated 
with  it. 
This 
can 
be  done 
by 
adopting 
the 
system 
of 
framework 
contracts, where 
the 
scale 
factor 
is 
used, 
whereas 
cost- 
consuming 
aspects such 
as 
storage 
and 
freight 
are 
avoided. 
At 
all 
levels 
of 
administration, 
procurement 
is 
being 
handled, 
often  improperly, by 
untrained, 
non-specialist 
staff, 
This 
constitutes 
a major 
weakness 
of 
the 
entire 
procurement 
system 
and 
it 
is 
important 
that 
measures 
for 
capacity 
building 
are 
devised 
as 
soon 
as 
possible 
and 
in 
a 
systemic 
manner. 
A 
capacity 
building 
strategy 
for 
the 
entire 
public 
sector 
is 
required 
Informationflow 
must 
be 
ensured 
to 
allow 
for proper monitoring 
The advantage 
of 
scale 
must 
be 
better 
utilized 
Capacity 
to 
conduct procurement 
is 
weak. 
The lack 
of 
a 
recognized 
procurement cadre 
affects 
the 
procurement 
system 
At 
present 
procurement 
is 
not 
recognized 
as 
an 
established 
profession 
within 
the 
public 
sector 
and 
does 
not 
present 
an 
attractive 
career 
path. 
This 
situation 
stands 
in 
the 
way 
of 
establishing 
the 
necessary 
capacity 
for 
proper procurement 
in 
compliance 
with 
existing

Zanzibar:

in

rules. 
It 
is 
therefore 
important 
that 
such 
a 
cadre 
is 
established 
within 
the 
civil 
service 
system 
in 
replacement 
of 
the  current  supplies 
officer 
category. 
Likewise,  a 
new 
professional body 
for 
the 
procurement 
profession should 
be 
set 
up to 
replace the 
National 
Board 
of 
Materials 
Management. 
It 
is 
generally recognized that 
corruption 
is 
a 
widespread occurrence 
within 
procurement. 
Corruption 
in 
procurement 
is 
explained by 
a 
number 
of 
factors, 
including  lack 
of 
accountability 
of 
public 
servants 
and 
lack 
of 
transparency 
at 
certain 
stages 
of 
the 
procurement 
process. 
Low 
public 
service 
salaries, 
lack 
of 
morale 
- 
also 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
private 
sector, 
and 
greed were 
other 
cited 
reasons. 
It 
is 
estimated 
that 
at 
the 
national level 
about 
20 
percent 
of 
the 
government expenditure 
on procurement 
is 
lost 
through 
corruption 
In 
the 
recent 
years 
the 
National 
Audit 
Office 
has 
received 
increased 
funds 
and 
technical 
assistance. 
However, 
the 
office 
still 
needs 
additional input 
in 
order 
to carry 
out 
full 
and 
frequent procurement audits. 
This 
must 
be 
paired 
with 
measures 
to 
ensure 
better 
and more 
frequent 
internal 
control. 
At 
present there 
is 
very 
little 
involvement 
of 
the 
media 
and 
civil 
society 
in 
the 
procurement 
process. 
This 
is 
due 
to lack 
of 
capacity 
and 
lack 
of 
knowledge 
on 
how 
the 
civil 
society 
and 
the media may 
be 
employed 
in 
monitoring 
procurement 
at 
the 
various levels. 
There 
is 
a 
need 
to 
initiate 
capacity 
building 
measures 
enabling 
NGOs 
to 
monitor 
procurement 
processes 
- 
especially 
at 
the 
local 
government 
level, 
and 
to 
introduce 
and 
inform 
about 
available 
whistleblowing 
mechanisms. 
Based 
on 
the  analysis 
of 
its  legislative 
framework, the 
effectiveness 
of 
its 
regulatory 
institutions, 
the 
strength 
of 
its 
enforcement regime, 
the 
capacity 
of 
its institutional 
and 
human 
resources, 
and the 
threat 
of 
corruption, 
the 
assessment 
found 
that 
the 
environment 
for 
conducting 
public 
procurement 
in 
Tanzania 
is 
high-risk. 
Tanzania’s 
effort 
to 
reform 
and 
improve 
its 
trade 
environment 
has 
picked 
up 
speed 
over 
the 
last 
five 
years. 
The most 
important 
factors 
for 
this improvement 
are 
more 
transparent 
and 
lower 
tariff 
rates 
and 
an 
elimination 
of 
most 
export 
and 
import 
licenses 
since 
the 
mid 
1980s. 
Obtaining 
bid 
security 
and 
letters 
of 
credit 
is 
very costly. 
The 
value 
of 
the 
security must 
either 
be 
100% 
cash 
cover or 
the value 
of 
the 
contract 
must 
be 
at 
least 
125% 
of 
the 
secured 
amount. The 
high lending 
rates and 
costs 
of 
bid 
security 
are caused 
by 
the 
unstable 
legal 
environment, the 
high 
cost 
of 
capital, 
a high 
degree 
of 
risk, 
general 
loan 
and 
collateral 
recovery problems. 
Commercial 
lending 
rates 
are 
high 
(I 
6.96% 
in 
November 
2002). 
Tanzania 
has 
pre-shipment 
inspection 
(PSI) 
and 
this 
is 
according to generally 
established 
procedures. 
However, 
there 
is 
strong 
evidence 
that 
PSI, 
due 
to  external 
factors, 
i.e. 
development 
of 
technology, 
is 
inefficient, 
and 
the 
introduction 
of 
a 
Post 
Entry 
Audit 
Program 
in 
December 
1999 
to 
inspect 
the 
already 
inspected 
goods 
confirms this notion. 
All 
indicators 
point 
towards 
an 
urgent 
need 
to 
move 
from 
PSI 
to 
Destination 
Inspection. 
Companies 
generally complain that 
they cannot 
obtain 
proper 
closure 
of 
their 
tax payments 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
year. 
The 
common pattern 
is 
that the Tanzanian 
Revenue 
Authority 
after 
4-5 
years 
will 
contact 
the company and 
demand 
to 
review 
all 
books, accounts, 
receipts, 
etc. 
This practice 
leads 
to 
an 
unstable 
environment 
where 
the 
cost 
of 
conducting 
business 
is 
difficult 
to calculate. 
The 
procurement 
system 
in 
Zanzibar 
is 
flawed 
and 
does 
not function properly 
and 
there 
is 
a 
need 
for  a 
general 
overhaul. 
Reforms should 
include  a 
new 
legal 
framework 
and 
decentralisation 
of 
procurement 
to 
ministerial 
and 
other 
levels. 
This 
must 
be 
associated 
with 
extensive capacity 
building 
and 
sensitisation 
at 
all 
levels. 
In 
addition,  efforts 
to 
establish 
an 
integrity 
and 
anti-corruption 
framework  must 
be 
stepped 
up, 
ideally 
in 
cooperation 
with 
institutions 
in 
Tanzania 
mainland.

IMF 
Concludes 
2002 
Article 
IV 
Consultation 
with 
Tanzania 
On 
November 
18,2002, 
the 
Executive 
Board 
of 
the 
International 
Monetary 
Fund 
(IMF) 
concluded 
the 
Article 
IV 
consultation 
with 
Tanzania. 
’’ 
Background 
Since 
the 
mid- 
1990s, 
Tanzania 
has 
made substantial progress 
in 
macroeconomic 
stabilization 
and 
structural 
reform. Real 
GDP 
growth 
has 
been 
on 
a 
rising 
trend; 
it 
has 
averaged 
more than 
5 
percent 
since 
the 
inception 
of 
the  current 
Poverty  Reduction 
and 
Growth  Facility 
(PRGF)-supported 
program 
in 
early 
2000, 
resulting 
in 
a 
small 
increase 
in 
per 
capita 
incomes, 
while 
inflation 
has 
declined 
to 
below 
5 
percent. 
A 
key 
factor 
contributing 
to 
a 
higher 
growth 
momentum 
in 
agriculture 
has 
been 
the 
liberalization 
of 
production 
and 
marketing 
structures, 
as 
well 
as 
of 
agricultural 
prices 
and 
the 
foreign 
exchange 
regime. 
Notwithstanding 
these 
achievements, 
poverty 
remains pervasive 
in 
Tanzania, 
and 
its 
growth 
momentum 
has 
been 
constrained 
by 
structural  impediments, 
notably 
governance-related 
problems 
and 
rigidities 
in 
the 
financial 
sector 
and 
serious 
capacity constraints. 
Moreover, 
weaknesses 
in 
tax 
policy 
and 
tax 
administration 
limit 
the 
government’s 
ability 
to 
mobilize 
revenue, 
leaving 
Tanzania 
highly 
dependent 
on 
foreign 
assistance. 
Real 
GDP 
grew 
by 
5.6 
percent 
in 
2001. 
The 
12-month 
rate 
of 
nonfood 
inflation 
rose 
from 
1.5 
percent 
in 
December 
2001 
to 
7.2 
percent 
in 
September 2002, 
largely 
as 
a 
result 
of 
a sharp increase 
in 
electricity tariffs 
in 
April; 
however, 
the 
overall 
inflation 
rate 
continued 
to 
decline 
to 
4.4 
percent 
by 
September 2002, 
as 
favorable 
developments 
in 
agricultural output helped 
contain 
increases in 
food 
prices. 
Fiscal  consolidation 
was 
central 
to 
the 
success 
in 
macroeconomic  stabilization. 
In 
support 
of 
Tanzania’s 
reform 
program, 
donors 
provided 
sizable 
financial 
assistance, 
which 
all 
but 
eliminated 
the 
government’s 
domestic 
financing 
needs, 
a 
major 
source 
of 
inflationary 
pressures 
in 
the 
past. 
Fiscal 
performance 
in 
2001/02 
(July-June) was 
broadly 
in 
line 
with 
the 
budget. 
Monetary 
developments 
in 
recent 
years 
were 
characterized 
by 
strong 
monetary 
expansion, 
as 
large 
foreign 
inflows 
were 
not 
fully 
sterilized 
and 
the 
demand 
for 
broad 
money 
expanded 
with 
the 
gradual 
deepening 
of 
the 
financial 
system. 
Primarily 
reflecting 
the 
lack 
of 
suitable 
lending 
opportunities, 
the 
banking 
system 
developed 
an 
increasingly 
large  structural 
liquidity 
surplus, 
which 
triggered 
an 
excess 
demand 
for 
treasury 
bills 
and, 
consequently, a 
decline 
in 
interest 
rates 
on 
treasury 
bills 
and 
deposits. 
So 
far 
in 
2002, 
increases 
in 
reserve 
money 
and 
broad money 
have been 
exceeding 
projections 
by 
wide 
margins, 
but 
as 
yet 
have 
not 
had 
much 
discernible 
impact 
on 
127 
Page  138

inflation. 
Since 
early 
200 
1, 
the 
Tanzania 
shilling 
has 
depreciated against 
the 
US. 
dollar 
by 
about 
15 
percent, 
reflecting 
the 
larger-than-anticipated 
monetary 
expansion. 
The 
ensuing 
real 
effective 
depreciation 
has 
now 
fully 
compensated 
for 
the 
real 
appreciation 
during 
2000, 
leaving agricultural 
producers 
to 
face, 
as 
before, 
the 
impact 
of 
lower 
international 
prices 
for 
coffee 
and 
cotton. 
Tanzania’s balance 
of 
payments 
position 
has 
strengthened 
substantially 
in 
recent 
years 
as 
a 
result 
of 
growth 
in 
nontraditional 
exports and 
a 
steady 
flow 
of 
foreign 
assistance; 
together 
with 
the 
debt 
relief 
under 
the 
Heavily 
Indebted Poor 
Countries 
(HIPC) 
Initiative, 
these 
developments  have 
resulted 
in 
a 
large 
increase 
in 
international 
reserves. 
Structural reforms 
have 
focused 
on 
the 
reform 
and 
privatization 
of 
parastatals, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
market-oriented 
regulatory framework. 
Since 
1992, 
about 
two-thirds 
of 
all 
state- 
owned 
companies  have  been 
privatized, 
including 
large 
enterprises, 
such 
as 
the 
port 
container 
terminal, 
part 
of 
the  telecommunications 
company, 
and 
the 
National  Bank 
of 
Commerce; 
meanwhile, 
the 
divestiture 
of 
strategic 
enterprises 
in 
the 
utility 
and transportation 
sectors 
is 
now 
gaining 
momentum.  The 
government 
has 
taken 
measures 
aimed 
at 
strengthening  economic 
governance, 
especially 
in 
public 
expenditure 
management, and 
improving 
the 
investment climate, 
with 
the 
recently 
created 
Investor 
Round 
Table 
serving 
as 
an 
important 
forum 
to 
identify 
impediments 
to 
investment. 
Executive 
Board 
Assessment 
Executive 
Directors 
commended 
the  Tanzanian  authorities 
for 
their 
steady 
pursuit 
of 
sound 
macroeconomic 
and 
structural  policies,  which, 
despite 
serious 
capacity  constraints 
and 
an 
often 
adverse 
external  environment, 
have 
resulted 
in 
high 
real 
GDP 
growth, 
low 
inflation, 
and 
a 
comfortable 
level 
of 
international 
reserves, 
and 
which 
have 
been 
supported 
by 
a steady 
flow 
of 
highly 
concessional 
assistance 
and 
debt 
relief 
from 
the 
international donor 
community. Directors 
considered 
that 
the 
main 
challenge 
for 
Tanzania 
is 
now to 
sustain 
high 
growth 
and 
reduce 
poverty 
while 
gradually 
lessening 
the 
dependence 
on 
external  aid. 
In 
this 
regard, 
they 
noted 
that  good 
progress has been made 
in 
the implementation 
of 
the 
poverty 
reduction 
strategy, 
and believed 
that 
with 
the 
continuation 
of 
sound 
policies 
Tanzania 
will 
be 
well 
on 
the 
way 
to 
achieving 
the 
targets 
set 
out 
in 
its 
Poverty Reduction 
Strategy Paper 
(PRSP). 
Directors 
attached 
high 
priority 
to 
medium-term fiscal 
consolidation, 
but 
noted 
that 
Tanzania’s 
low 
revenue 
yield 
and concomitant  heavy 
dependence 
on 
external 
assistance 
hinder 
the 
attainment 
of 
this 
objective. 
They 
therefore 
welcomed 
the 
recent 
measures 
to 
increase revenue 
collection, 
but 
stressed 
that further 
and 
more 
concerted 
efforts 
to 
widen 
the 
tax 
base 
and 
improve 
tax 
and 
customs 
administration 
will 
be 
needed. 
Directors 
endorsed 
the 
decision 
not 
to 
introduce 
the 
Export 
Processing 
Zone 
Act 
until 
it 
has 
been 
reviewed, 
given 
the 
potential 
for 
revenue 
losses. 
Directors 
commended  the  impressive 
progress  made 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
expenditure 
reform 
and 
transparency. 
However, 
they noted that 
domestic arrears have 
continued 
to 
accumulate, 
and 
urged 
the 
authorities 
to 
move 
quickly 
to 
strengthen 
expenditure 
control 
and 
to 
set 
up 
the 
institutional 
and 
legal framework 
needed 
to 
give 
effect 
to 
the 
recently 
adopted 
national 
debt 
strategy. 
Directors 
welcomed  the 
budget’s 
increasing  focus 
on 
education 
and 
health. 
They  believed 
that 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
expenditure 
in 
these 
sectors, 
especially 
at 
the 
local 
government 
level, 
would 
be 
enhanced 
by 
the 
planned 
measures 
to 
improve 
the 
tracking 
of 
poverty-related 
spending. 
Directors 
looked 
forward 
to 
the 
completion 
of 
the 
civil 
service 
reform, 
which 
should 
help 
attract 
qualified 
personnel, 
halt 
the 
departure 
of 
well-trained 
staff, 
and 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
public 
service.

Directors 
emphasized 
the 
need 
to 
keep 
monetary 
developments 
under 
control 
in 
order 
to 
contain 
inflation 
and 
to 
restore 
positive 
real 
interest 
rates. 
They 
therefore 
supported 
the 
decision 
to 
convert 
the government’s non-marketable 
debt 
to 
the 
central 
bank 
into 
securities. 
Directors 
considered that 
the 
flexible 
exchange 
rate regime 
has 
served 
Tanzania 
well, 
by 
facilitating 
timely 
adjustments 
to 
changes 
in 
Tanzania’s 
external 
environment. 
Nevertheless, 
they 
believed 
that 
Tanzania’s 
competitiveness 
needed 
to 
be 
strengthened 
by 
structural 
reforms 
to 
improve 
the 
investment 
climate 
and 
strengthen 
the 
productive 
sectors. 
Directors 
considered 
privatization 
to 
be 
vitally 
important 
to 
the 
development 
of 
the 
private 
sector 
and 
to 
the 
achievement 
of 
the 
authorities’ 
economic 
growth 
objectives. 
They 
applauded  the 
government’s 
accomplishments 
to 
date 
in 
this 
area, 
and 
encouraged 
the 
authorities 
to 
push 
ahead 
with 
the 
privatization 
of 
the 
large 
enterprises, 
especially 
those 
in 
the 
utility 
and 
transportation 
sectors. 
Directors 
also 
stressed 
the 
importance 
of 
improving 
the 
business 
environment 
and 
removing 
impediments 
to 
private 
investment, 
particularly 
through institution-building, 
and labor 
market, 
administrative, 
and 
judicial 
reform. 
They 
looked forward 
to follow-up 
action 
on 
the 
policy 
matrix 
of 
short-term 
actions 
that had 
emerged 
from 
the 
recent Investors’ Roundtable Conference. 
Directors 
regarded 
financial 
deepening 
as 
another 
crucial 
input 
into 
the expansion 
of 
the 
private 
sector 
in 
Tanzania, 
with 
microfinance 
development considered 
to 
be 
especially 
important. 
They 
noted 
the 
existence 
of 
structural impediments 
to 
bank 
lending 
and 
persistent 
large 
interest 
rate 
spreads, 
and 
called 
for 
an accelerated 
effort 
to 
remove 
these 
impediments, 
including 
an 
amendment 
of 
the 
Land 
Act 
to 
unblock 
the 
use 
of 
land 
as 
collateral 
for 
bank 
loans. 
Directors 
welcomed 
the 
authorities’ 
request 
for 
an 
Financial 
Sector 
Assessment 
Program 
(FSAP) 
review. 
Directors noted 
the  strong 
country ownership 
that 
has 
allowed 
the 
PRSP 
to 
become 
the 
main 
instrument 
for 
coordinating 
domestic 
poverty reduction 
programs between 
the 
authorities 
and 
the 
international community. 
Directors 
also recommended 
that 
the 
linkage 
between 
the 
PRSP 
and 
the 
budget 
be 
strengthened 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
poor 
benefit 
more 
fully 
from 
the 
resources 
freed 
from 
the 
HIPC 
Initiative. 
They 
looked forward 
to 
receiving 
the 
second annual  progress 
report 
on 
PRSP 
implementation, 
and 
the 
joint 
staffs 
assessment 
of 
it. 
Directors  noted 
with 
satisfaction  that 
Tanzania’s 
public 
and 
publicly-guaranteed external 
debt 
burden 
remains 
sustainable 
after 
the 
HIPC 
Initiative 
completion point. 
They 
urged 
a 
cautious 
external 
debt 
management 
strategy, 
with 
tightened 
approval 
procedures 
for 
foreign borrowing. 
However, 
Directors 
expressed concern 
that 
some 
non-Paris 
Club 
and 
commercial 
creditors 
have 
failed 
to 
provide 
debt 
relief 
on 
terms 
comparable 
to 
those 
provided 
by 
the  Paris 
Club. 
They 
commended 
the 
authorities 
for 
establishing 
a special 
account 
earmarked 
for 
honoring 
debt-service 
payments 
to 
these 
creditors, 
and  supported 
the 
authorities’ 
request 
for 
Fund 
assistance 
in 
encouraging 
the 
participation 
of 
these 
creditors 
in 
the 
HIPC 
Initiative. 
Directors 
looked 
forward 
to 
the 
publication 
of 
the 
second progress 
report 
on 
implementation 
of 
a 
national  anticorruption 
strategy. 
They 
urged 
the 
authorities 
to 
vigorously 
enforce 
laws 
and 
regulations 
aimed 
at 
promoting 
good 
governance. 
Directors 
observed 
that, 
notwithstanding 
considerable 
technical 
advice 
in 
the 
statistical 
area 
and 
generally 
good  implementation 
of 
such  advice,  Tanzania’s 
database 
remains  weak 
because 
of 
capacity 
constraints. 
They 
recommended 
that 
priority 
be given 
to 
removing 
key 
data 
weaknesses 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
the 
national 
accounts, the balance 
of 
payments, 
and 
the 
consumer 
price 
index.
