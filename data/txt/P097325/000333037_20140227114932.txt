﻿1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.    Overview. Poverty in Uganda declined in the 20 years leading up to the PRSC8-
10 series, with the poverty head count falling from 44 percent in 1997 to 31 percent by
2005/06 (Uganda National Household Survey). However, inequality persisted among
regions, between rural and urban areas, and within cities. War in the North had prevented
that region from developing with the rest of Uganda. Uganda's level of inequality was
about average for Sub-Saharan African non-mineral exporting economies.
2.    Uganda has one of the highest population growth rates in the world at 3.4 percent
and the third highest fertility rate in the world, with 6.1 children per woman. The
population doubled since 1986 to 34.5 million inhabitants (2011). Considering this rapid
population growth, the decline in poverty was a significant achievement. At the time of
appraisal, the population was estimated to grow to 68 million in 2035 and to 100 million
in 2050. Uganda's dependency ratio of 1.12 was high, which decreased household ability
to save and invest productively and put pressure on public services. Uganda's
demographic trend was a key theme in the 2010 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS).
3.    Progress toward MDGs. Uganda was considered likely to achieve MDG 1,
poverty reduction and hunger eradication; MDG 2, universal primary education; and
MDG 3, gender equality and empowerment of women. With the introduction of universal
primary education, primary enrollment increased to 92 percent, with near gender parity.
Access to safe water in both rural and urban areas was on target; 65 percent of rural
households and 71 percent of urban households had access, compared with MDG targets
of 62 and 77 percent, respectively. Access to sanitation facilities was 68 percent,
compared with the MDG target of 72 percent.
4.    Child and maternal mortality remained high and the MDG was unlikely to be met,
with under five mortality of 137/1,000 and maternal mortality of 435 per 100,000 births.
MDG 6, combating HIV/AIDS and malaria, and MDG 7, environmental sustainability,
were still attainable. The HIV/AIDS prevalence had fallen from 15 percent in 1990 to 6.2
percent in 2000, although it was rising again. Malaria continued to be a main cause of
mortality.
5.    History of budget support. At the time of the appraisal the GOU and the Bank
had already partnered on seven previous Poverty Reduction Support Credits with PRSC 1
effective November 29, 2001. The total resource envelope of the seven operations was
US$1.06 billion equivalent. This partnership had resulted in considerable capacity
building in government institutions, including the capacity to identify and respond to
governance failures. This capacity was developed in independent institutions such as the
Inspectorate General of Government (IGG) as well as within ministries including the
Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MOFPED).
1


﻿6.    Governance context. Despite this improved capacity, serious governance
challenges persisted at PRSC8-10 appraisal. The Program Document (PD) cited
deficiencies in the way public servants were recruited, deployed and rewarded, which led
to high vacancy and absenteeism rates in public institutions. Weak accountability was
evident from the lack of consequences for inadequate performance by public officials
with only 38 percent of cases of abuse of public office being investigated. The Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) indicators showed weaknesses in
transparency and accountability in the use of public resources. These governance
challenges were made more difficult by the creation of new districts which stretched
scarce human capacity while burdening local authorities with additional administrative
overhead at the expense of public service delivery.
7.    Rationale for PRSC 8, 9 and 10. The PRSC 8-10 series was a core component of
the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) FY2011-2015 that was discussed by the Board in
May 2010. The series aimed at CAS objectives 2. enhance public infrastructure; 3.
promote human capital development; and 4. support good governance and accountability.
The PRSC series was intended to complement a range of investment projects, including a
health sector operation to improve national capacity to deliver the Uganda National
Minimum Health Care Package, with special emphasis on maternal and newborn care.
Higher level objectives to which the operation contributed included support to the
Government's National Development Program (NDP).
8.    The PRSC series was prepared within the Joint Budget Support Framework
(JBSF). The overall objective of the JBSF was to enhance service delivery and to
contribute to poverty reduction in Uganda through support to the implementation of the
GOU's poverty eradication policies within the framework of the NDP. The JBSF was to
provide a long-term, transparent and predictable framework for providing budget support
that harmonized performance assessments and aligned the timing of budget support
decisions to the national budget process. The JBSF had three components:
*  An agreement among development partners and government about structures for
cooperation.
*  A Joint Performance Assessment Framework (JAF), endorsed in October 2009,
which development partners used to enhance policy effectiveness and to assess
the recipient's (Government) performance in agreed areas.
*  A Technical and Administration Support Unit (TASU) to support the JBSF.
1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
9.    The PDO for the PRSC series was: "improved access to, and greater value for
money (VFM) in, public services." This PDO is from the Program Document (PD).1 The
1 While the Financing Agreements contained all of the legally binding prior actions for each operation, it
did not contain the PDO for the series.
2


﻿series was designed to improve expenditure efficiency and value for money in the 'JBSF
sectors,' health, education, transport, and water and sanitation by addressing cross-cutting
and sector-specific bottlenecks. Sub-objectives were organized in separate Policy
Clusters (Table 1). In line with the Government's strategy, these operations placed a
strong emphasis on performance-based management through tools such as output-
oriented budgeting and results-oriented management. The broad sub-objectives are made
program-specific by their associated key indicators.

10.    There were also 16 intermediate indicators (denoted as IIs) to supplement the key
indicators, two of which are used in Table 1 (contracts with a full set of documents and
percentage of LGs publishing financial transfers and budgets). Some sub-objectives cover
more than one component (e.g., strengthened public sector management covers both
transparency in funding service delivery and accountability and anti-corruption
components-Section 1.4) so there is not always a one-to-one correspondence between
objectives and components.
1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification
11.    There were no revisions to the PDO or the PDO indicators. The sub-objective for
sexual and reproductive health care was dropped under the PRSC series because it was
adopted by the Health Systems Strengthening Project.

﻿1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program:
12.   This PRSC series addressed the two most critical performance impediments in
public expenditure management with a bearing on service delivery - (i) insufficient
credibility of the budget; and (ii) inadequate funding at the service delivery level and
poor reporting on the use of the funds. In the component descriptions below, references
are made to specific prior actions and PRSC 10 triggers in parentheses. Prior actions for
PRSC8-9 and triggers for PRSC 10 are presented in Annex 6, Tables A., B. and C.
Policy Cluster 1: Reforms in Public Expenditure Management, Public Financial
Management, and Public Service Management that Improve Service Delivery
13.   Component 1.1 Credibility of the Budget: i) Adhere to a 5 percent variance
threshold for the GOU budget in the four JBSF sectors; ii) change from monthly to
quarterly budget releases; and iii) piloting the use of quarterly work plans and
procurement plans in the ministries/agencies corresponding to the four JBSF sectors
(PRSC 8 prior action 1, PRSC 9 prior action 1, PRSC 10 trigger 1)
14.   Component 1.2 Transparency in Funding at Service Delivery Level: To
improve transparency of local government expenditures, the MOFPED was to develop,
produce and publish quarterly reports on actual Local Government (LG) expenditures and
outputs (PRSC 9 prior action 2, PRSC 10 trigger 2).
15.   Component 1.3 Public Financial Management (PFM): i) better compliance
with PFM laws and regulations with greater emphasis on performance-based assessment
of public servants, with an emphasis on both rewards and sanctions; ii) strengthening
internal and external audit capacity; iii) improve compliance, control arrears in the period
covered by PRSC 9 and 10; and iv) PFM legislation to add provisions related to
management of oil revenue and strengthening in other areas (PRSC 8 prior action 2,
PRSC 9 prior action 3, PRSC 10 trigger 3).
16.   Component 1.4 Compliance with Public Procurement Regulations: i)
strengthen the legal and regulatory framework for procurement; ii) improved monitoring
for better enforcement of procurement laws and sanctioning of breaches by establishing
and piloting a system for measuring performance in public procurement; and iii) improve
procurement capacity within spending entities (PRSC 8 prior action 3, PRSC 9 prior
action 4, PRSC 10 trigger 4).
17.   Component 1.5 Performance of Public Servants: i) address the inequitable
distribution of public servants across the country, as well as the significant variation in
the level of their performance; ii) address weaknesses in the inspection and disciplinary
system for public servants that lead to poor accountability and performance; iii) instill a
stronger sense of ethic and accountability in the public service by enhancing and
coordinating performance management tools; and iv) rolling out performance
management tools and pay reforms and improving management systems for personnel
4


﻿and payroll (PRSC 8 prior actions 4, 5 and 6, PRSC 9 prior actions 5 and 8, PRSC 10
trigger 5).
18.   Component 1.6 Accountability and Anti-Corruption: i) strengthen the tracking
of corruption trends by the Inspector General of Government (IGG) and other key
institutions by developing evidence-based data to promote anti-corruption reform and
facilitate the demand side of governance, and by deepening the public dialogue about
corruption across all stakeholders; and ii) supporting GOU's effort to disseminate key
Data Tracking Mechanism (DTM) findings, and reach out to and involve non-state actors
in monitoring (PRSC 9 prior action 6, PRSC 10 trigger 6).
Policy Cluster 2: Improving Value for Money in Public Service Delivery Sectors
19.   Component 2.1 Health: i) improve the availability of essential medicines and
health supplies in health centers; and ii) improve the availability of qualified health staff
at task (PRSC 8 prior action 5, PRSC 9 prior action 7).
20.   Component 2.2 Education: i) improve the equitableness of teacher deployment
and ii) improved accountability of head teachers (PRSC 8 prior action 6, PRSC 9 prior
action 8, PRSC 10 trigger 7).
21.   Component 2.3 Water and Sanitation: i) increase the functionality of rural
water facilities and Water for Production (WfP) facilities; and ii) improve the levels of
sanitation and hygiene (PRSC 8 prior action 7, PRSC 9 prior action 9).
22.   Component 2.4 Transport: i) help ensure stable funding for road maintenance
and increased quality of the maintenance work by year-by-year monitoring of road
quality by first generating national, district and sub-district data on the quality of roads,
starting with the set of baseline data, and establishing a monitoring and evaluation
framework to systematically track improvements in the sector; and ii) improve
transparency and accountability in the roads subsector (Uganda National Roads
Authority-UNRA) which would seek to obtain procurement accreditation from PPDA
and begin implementation of an independent and parallel bid evaluation process (PRSC 8
prior action 8, PRSC 9 prior action 10, PRSC10 trigger 8).
1.5 Revised Policy Areas
No revisions.
1.6 Other significant changes
23.   PRSC 8 was delayed by several months because of difficulties fulfilling prior
actions related to procurement and civil service reform. Because of non-fulfillment, the
Bank had planned to reduce the amount of PRSC 8 to US$60 million. However, because
of macroeconomic concerns, Bank management made available an additional US$40
million through the financial crisis window (CW) and so the total amount of PRSC 8
5


﻿became US$100 million.2 PRSC 9 disbursement was delayed until June 2013 for two
reasons: First, because of a material error in the documentation for Parliament on the
SDR/US$ exchange rate which was outdated (delay from April 2012 to October 2012-5
months) and, second, because of a Government corruption scandal that interrupted budget
support operations until the matter could be remedied (October 2012 to June 2013-8
months)-See Box 1. Though it achieved almost all of its triggers, PRSC 10 was dropped
by mutual agreement with the GOU, and never went to the Board.
2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Program Performance
24.    Macroeconomic framework summary. Two external factors and one internal
factor caused a degree of macroeconomic instability during the program. A global
economic crisis, a prolonged drought, and increased election related spending in 2010
contributed to a drop in annual GDP growth to 3.4 percent in FY12, less than half the
average of the previous decade. There was also a peak in the fiscal deficit of 7.2 percent
of GDP (9.5 excluding grants). The economy stabilized in FY13 with public expenditure
subsiding to 18.6 percent of GDP in FY12. The inflation rate during 2011/12 spiked to
23.4 percent, but settled to 6.2 percent (estimated) the following year as Table 2 shows.
25.    There was not a specific prior action to deal with macroeconomic stability
because this issue was addressed in the context of broader JAF. As described in Section 1
of the JAF, if preconditions for joint budget support, in particular the conditions for
macroeconomic stability (and a number of other areas such as good governance, poverty
focus, etc), were not met then also the PRSC series could not go ahead. Because of the
stringent prerequisites in JAF section 1, to include a duplicate prior action would have
been "wasting" a prior action. The GOU had also a long history of strong performance
with respect to its macroeconomic performance.
2 The PD for PRSC 8 provided a detailed explanation of the reason for the changes in total financing: "The
amount of PRSC 8 budget support is US$100 million, comprising US$60 million country IDA and US$40
million from the Crisis Response Window to help GoU mitigate the impact of the global economic crisis.
The total credit amount is a reduction from the planned amount of US$140 million as a result of inadequate
strengthening of the legal framework for public procurement and slow progress in public service reform.
The draft Amendment to the Procurement Law presented to Parliament meets international best practice in
most areas, with the exception of the amendment to allow unrestricted use of force account. This originally
agreed prior action has therefore been dropped. It is given high weight in the assessment of government
performance under the program since achieving efficiency in public procurement is critical to Uganda's
reforms to achieve value for money in public spending, especially given that at least 55 percent of the
government budget is expended through public procurement. Unrestricted use of force account could
compromise value for money in public works as well as stifle development of the local construction sector.
Furthermore, progress against key reform actions has been slow in public service reform - also a central
aspect for achieving higher value for money in public spending. The government has not yet finalized a
single framework for performance management by linking results oriented management and output
oriented budgeting, and its implementation must now be accelerated to achieve program objectives of the
series. Government is expected to finalize this framework under PRSC 9.

﻿26.    The Bank was in close partnership with the other JBSF donors and had a firm,
joint stand on the JAF prerequisites. Their effectiveness was tested in the spring of 2011
where in the run up to presidential elections (February 18, 2011) massive spending
increases were pushed through in some areas, funded to a large extent by reallocating
budget funds from social sectors. The Bank team was able to use the JAF Section 1
precondition on budget predictability, limited reallocations during the year etc. combined
with an exercise in budget analysis (using PEFA methodology) by TASU and a similar
one by PREM to show World Bank management and the JBSF countries' ambassadors
that on purely objective, technical grounds the Government was not meeting the said
precondition in JAF Section1, and therefore recommended that the Bank halt budget
support disbursements (and some other donors followed suit). After that halting of the
PRSC 9 disbursement (for 6 months until agreed budget credibility measures had been
implemented in October 2011) MOFPED focused greater attention on budget credibility,
and budget execution was stronger

27.    Meeting Program    Prior Actions. Policy actions covering budget, service
delivery in health and education, PFM, procurement reform and civil service reform were
met (Annex 6). The delay in the action to present a procurement amendment bill to
Parliament that meets international best practice delayed the approval of PRSC 8 until
September 30, 2010. PRSC 9 was approved on February 28, 2012. In some cases the
GOU expanded the coverage of the prior actions from a pilot to a government-wide level,
including performance contracts, control of HR processes by the employing agency,
publishing of LG transfers and expenditures and some procurement reforms.
28.    After approval of PRSC 9, there were, as mentioned, two additional delays
totaling 13 months. When the corruption scandal broke out in GOU (Box 1), all budget
support under the JBSF was put on hold. The Bank maintained that the corruption
scandal raised questions about whether the PRSC 9-supported program remained on track
7


﻿to achieving its PDO, in particular, improving VFM.3 The GOU took remedial measures
specified in a High Level Action Matrix (HLAM) and PRSC 9 disbursed at the end of
June 2013. Thus, the original plan of two PRSCs (8 and 9) to be delivered in FY11 was
substantially delayed.
BOX 1: Corruption Scandal Potentially Affecting VFM
In October 2012, the Auditor General of Uganda released a report raising serious concerns
about a number of governance issues affecting value for money in public services. According
to the report, a substantial amount of funds (approximately US$18 million) provided by the
Governments of Denmark, Ireland, Norway, and Sweden as official development assistance
was transferred in 2011 to dormant accounts of the Office of Prime Minister at the Bank of
Uganda and then used in a fraudulent way. IDA requested to conduct an exchange of views
with the Government of Uganda on progress achieved in carrying out the program before any
decisions on disbursement of the credit's proceeds would be made. In December 2012, after
extensive discussions with IDA and other donors, the Government of Uganda committed to
implement a policy actions plan aimed at strengthening governance and improving public
financial management. In June 2013, implementation of the plan was deemed satisfactory.
29.    In a number of instances, the language of the PRSC 9 triggers was refined to
make the prior action more specific. The most substantive change concerned PRSC 9
prior action 4 in which Parliament wanted to issue procurement regulations rather than
the MOFPED, as was customary. So the language of the prior action changed from
MOFPED issuing the regulations to MOFPED approving the regulations prior to
submission to Parliament. MOFPED also drafted the regulations.
30.    The Decision Meeting for PRSC 9 proposed making the PRSC program more
focused on governance. To do that, the Regional Operations Committee (ROC) suggested
eliminating several of the sector triggers for PRSC 10 and that triggers related to oil and
gas revenue and Governance and Accountability (GAC) be strengthened. As a result,
PRSC 10 did not have water or health sector triggers and the education trigger only called
for continued application of the teacher allocation formula. The GOU fulfilled six of the
eight triggers and partially fulfilled the other two even though the operation was later
dropped. Implementation progress was measured against annual targets, with ISR
missions updating achievements as of end of the (GOU and Bank) fiscal year using a
carefully and intensively coordinated JAF.
' The Bank informed the GOU by letter dated November 16, 2012: "Pursuant to clause 3.01 (a) of the
Financing Agreement, the Association therefore requests to exchange views on progress achieved in
carrying out the Program with the objective to ascertain whether the Withdrawal Release Conditions under
Schedule I, Section II remain satisfied before the Association takes any decision on processing the
application for withdrawal of funds."

﻿2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:
31.   Government Commitment. Government commitment was strong for the most
part, consistent with its long history in PRSC supported programs and by the fact that the
GOU went beyond the targets for many of the actions. Competing with this fact is that,
by mutual agreement of GOU and the Bank, the final operation of the series was
cancelled, and there was a general shift away from budget support. The cancellation can
be attributed to general governance concerns that had arisen outside of the PRSC
program as well as to the recognition that budget support could no longer be relied upon
as a predictable source of funds on which to base a budget plan, and other types of
lending and knowledge were more appropriate in the current context.
32.   Applied Lessons from Previous Operations. The design of the PRSC 8-10
series made excellent use of key lessons from the ICR from the previous PRSC 5-7 series
and the 2009 IEG Country Assessment Evaluation. These lessons include:
*  Greater focus on public investment priorities for growth and poverty reduction,
which recognized the need to preserve expenditures on the JBSF sectors and the
GOU's priority to improve VFM in public expenditures.
*  High transaction costs are necessary on the donor side to ensure a strong
PRSC program. A great deal of staff time was needed to coordinate with
development partners and build a good results framework.
*  While broad, complex policy operations are valuable at capturing a wide
variety of needed initiatives, they do come at a cost. The lagging parts of the
program tend to get an inordinate amount of attention and may hold up and even
damage other activities that might otherwise perform better and move faster.
PRSC 8-10's design was not as broad as that of the previous series, but it also ran
into some of the same delays that the previous series experienced, partly because
PRSC 8-10 was still broad in coverage, with challenging areas of reform.
*  Alignment with the national budget cycle. There are advantages to aligning the
PRSC with the GOU budget cycle. Typically, though project documents
acknowledged that this alignment was an objective, the PRSCs lagged months
behind the government's call for individual ministerial programs. The PD
maintained that the PRSC 8-10 series would improve the predictability of
concessional resources, but that turned out not to be the case with the delays of
PRSC 8 and 9 and the cancellation of PRSC 10.
*  The need to strengthen the link between the cross-cutting reform agenda in
the PRSC and sectoral reforms. Previous PRSCs have worked at both sectoral
and national levels but had been less successful at engaging government across
sectors. The JBSF workshop for preparation of the PRSC 8-10 series in May
2009, focused on cross-cutting impediments to service delivery that might stem
from procurement, PSM, PFM, or decentralization issues. The workshop focused
9


﻿on measures to address underlying causes and reduce the performance
impediments that lie outside the purview of the sector ministry, and, therefore, to
discuss coordinated actions by different agencies of government (Annex 7).
*  Under PRSC 7, the government established that compliance with the
procurement law was low and that it was necessary to strengthen compliance
mechanisms. This enforcement mechanism included amendments to the
procurement law (concluded under PRSC 8). There were some setbacks as the
proposed draft amendments sometimes differed from international best practice.
Improvement in the procurement law was pursued under PRSC 8 along with
alignment of procurement and work plans.
*  Reforming a law that involves multiple stakeholder interests and possible
rent seeking requires not only reasonable lead time but also extensive time
for dialogue. This dialogue was part of the preparation for PRSC8-10. For
example, in the process of amending the procurement law under PRSC 7,
additional proposals emerged which were likely to restrict open competition in
procurement and would therefore weaken the law. Following extensive
consultations with stakeholders, most of these weaknesses were corrected in the
Bill that went to Parliament.
33.   Analytical Work. Complementing the lessons from experience was a substantial
body of analytical work including:
*  The 2007 Country Economic Memorandum, which helped Government to
develop a prioritized, time-bound and consistent set of policy actions, investments
and interventions.
*  The 2007 Public Expenditure Review (PER) highlighted that the budget should be
oriented towards infrastructure spending to support growth. It also indicated that
this would require public administration reform and more cost-effective public
spending to create the needed fiscal space including efficiencies in public
education sector spending.
*  The 2009 PER provided an analysis of how to improve efficiency in health sector
outcomes from public health sector spending.
*  The 2010 PER provided recommendations for how to raise technical and
allocative efficiency in road construction and maintenance. Poor procurement
systems and contract management were identified as a binding constraint for the
sector.
*  The 2008 Public Financial Management (PFM) report and the 2009 PEFA have
informed the reform agenda in PFM.
*  Public Service Management, which was a pilot study using actionable governance
indicators to analyze human resource management informed the design of public
service reforms.
10


﻿* The 2010 Oil policy notes provided recommendations for the draft petroleum bill
and the policy framework for the petroleum revenue management paper with an
impact on PRSCs.
Assessment of PRSC design and other factors affecting implementation
34.   The scope of PRSC 8-10 broadened with the inclusion of development partners'
priorities under the JBSF, which included reforms in the four JBSF sectors, PFM and
procurement, budget credibility and civil service reforms. Despite the broadness, the
program used the synergies in the cross-cutting themes of compliance, civil service
performance, and efficiency of distribution of health and education workers, all of which
worked toward the fulfillment of the PDO of improved access and VFM.
Additional Positive and Negative Factors in Implementation
(i)   Donor coordination. The PRSCs helped to streamline and coordinate
donor support, which led to increased resource flows from donors. Donor coordination
was beneficial to the Government as transactions costs of dealing with many donors were
reduced. On the other side, the Bank team bore much of the additional burden of the
JBSF coordination effort.
(ii)   Special efforts to build a strong results framework. The Bank balanced
the objective of ownership and the objective of results measurement by providing
effective assistance to governments to support the design, implementation, and utilization
of findings from those M&E efforts, and by ensuring selectivity and realism in the choice
of PRSC indicators. These efforts paid off because the JAF was far more effective in
measuring the operation than was the results framework for the PRSC series 5-7.
(iii)  Cross-cutting approach to reforms. In most instances, service delivery
reforms cannot be done without appropriate measures taken across the public sector as a
whole, including key ministries such as Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic
Development (MOFPED), Public Procurement and Disposal of Asset (PPDA), Ministry
of Local Government (MOLG), Ministry of Public Service (MOPS), and Ministry of
Gender, Labor and Social Development. Each of these ministries was closely involved in
the PRSC series and, though it was difficult at times to coordinate across sectors, each
was able to cooperate on key cross-cutting measures, such as performance contracts.
(iv) Technical Assistance Support Unit (TASU). TASU provided
technical/research analysis which contributed to policy design, as well as administrative
and logistical support to the JBSF. TASU coordinated, and where appropriate,
commissioned studies as part of the substantial analytical work needed to inform the
assessment of performance under the JAF, and the establishment of policy frameworks
for subsequent years. The TASU work program was supported by the World Bank/PREM
in-house expertise, including all aspects of quality control and dissemination.
11


﻿(v)  Proliferation of districts. The number of districts increased considerably
from 56 in 2001 to 80 in 2006 and currently stands at 112, with the argument of bringing
services nearer to a rapidly growing population. Fiscal decentralization has not followed
the same pace, with 90 percent of local budgets still coming from the center. While the
impact of the creation of new districts on public expenditures has been low to date, "this
impact is apt to increase in the future, however, making district proliferation a potential
'time bomb.' This is because the share of vacant positions in district governments
(currently about 40 percent) has been increasing along with the number of districts"
(Public Expenditure Review 2013). This factor has made the equitable allocation of
teachers and healthcare workers more challenging to achieve.
(vi)  Impact of petroleum. Commercial amounts of petroleum are expected by
2016 or later, with peak production in 2018. Reserves are estimated at more than 2 billion
barrels and could sustain the country for up to 20 years. GOU is considering limiting
daily extraction to 60,000 barrels and to build a refinery with the same capacity. Such an
option would limit revenue flows to about 3 percent of non-oil GDP, which would reduce
institutional and macroeconomic risks associated with the "resource curse". The
disadvantage is that the limited revenue stream would not be sufficient to close Uganda's
fiscal gap, currently covered by foreign aid, and the needed acceleration in infrastructure
investments. The Bank continued the policy dialogue with GOU on the oil sector. The
focus on strengthening public sector management and value for money service delivery in
the social sectors was appropriate as the country prepared for oil revenue flows, and the
attendant greater risk of wasting money.
(vii) HLAM. In late 2012 the Government developed the HLAM Matrix which
covered actions ranging from forensic audit of key line ministries and departments to
strengthening accountability institutions such as the Department of Public Prosecution
(DPP) and the Inspectorate General of Government (IGG). The disbursement of PRSC 9
was linked to the satisfactory implementation of a Government-led plan to strengthen key
systems and improve accountability.
(viii) Cancellation of PRSC 10. After the corruption scandal hit, the
enthusiasm for budget support quickly waned, although the scandal had nothing to do
with the PRSC supported program. PRSC 9 was placed on hold as the GOU initiated
remedial actions under the HLAM. An eight-month process ensued where the GOU was
able to restore confidence in governance sufficiently to go forward with the disbursement
of US$100 million for PRSC 9 in June 2013. The question remained what to do with
PRSC1O. By not going forward with PRSC 10 the GOU budget had to adjust to US$100
million less in resources. This represented an important but not decisive impact on the
overall budget as it accounted for 1.8 percent of the total budget. The GOU was able to
adjust to the loss of resources without a loss of funding in JBSF sectors.
Risks identified at appraisal and effectiveness of mitigation
35.   Risk: Macroeconomic Policy Management. The Bank and the Fund continued
close monitoring and policy dialogue with GOU to address the potential deterioration of
12


﻿the macroeconomic policy stance from lax discipline because of the future availability of
oil resources as well as exogenous factors. Fiscal and monetary indicators were mostly
stable except for 2011/12, with inflation at 23.4 percent (which fell to single digits the
next year) and the surge in the fiscal deficit, 9.5 percent of GDP (excluding grants) in the
same year. The risk of a surge in oil revenues did not materialize.
36.   Risk: Fiscal and debt sustainability. To combat the risk of unanticipated
expenditures and growing resistance to ongoing adjustment, such as electricity increases
and non-priority spending, the Bank provided technical support to improve public
investment planning, and implementation capacity. There was a risk of possible debt
distress related to higher interest rates on government securities, increased quasi-fiscal
risks associated with contingent liabilities, and lowered growth dividends from public
investments. This risk did not threaten the PRSC-supported program. In addition, the
PRSC focused on policies designed to improve expenditure efficiency and VFM.
Risks more specific to the PRSC program
37.   Risk: Political and governance. The governance environment surfaced as a
major risk to the program. The Bank mitigated the risk by working with GOU over the
long-term to strengthen institutions and accountability systems. Indeed, it was the
Auditor General who uncovered the corruption in the PM's office. Thus, the scandal was
detected by previously built capacity. More importantly, the MOFPED engaged
intensively with the Bank to remedy the problem and restore a degree of confidence with
the development partners.
38.   Risk: Donor coordination. The PRSC series was part of the JBSF which
embodied donor coordination, but which also led to heightened transactions costs on the
donor side and a degree of rigidity in the implementation framework. While the benefits
of the JBSF materialized, so did the risks. Through the coordination structure, the Bank
and its partners were able to work through differences in dealing with design and
governance issues.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
39.   Design. The results framework for PRSC 8-10 was a major accomplishment. It
was derived from the broader NDP and was part of an intensively negotiated JAF, which
had GOU, Bank and other development partner buy-in. A key factor in the improvement
of results measurement were the staff in the Office of Prime Minister who were strongly
committed to results measurement. Another important factor was that the selection of
indicators benefited substantially from the ICR assessment of experience from the
previous PRSC series (5-7), whose results framework contained far too many indicators,
many of which were not relevant or measurable within the timeframe of the program. The
PRSC 8-10 framework was a stronger tool for management because the JBSF
development partners all shared the same framework. The indicators were monitorable
within the time frame of the project, were to a significant extent attributable to program
activities, and had realistic targets. There was a close correspondence between
13


﻿conditionality and the key indicators. Annex 8 provides an example of a flowchart used
to ensure that the results framework reflected key constraints, relevant activities and
indicators.
40.    Implementation. The collection methods used standard GOU statistical processes
and were part of the normal GOU reporting framework. One innovation in data gathering
overcame an obstacle to measuring absenteeism of teachers and health workers. Rather
than observing absenteeism directly, households were asked about the presence of
teachers and health workers, which facilitated measurement significantly. Substantial
implementation capacity was built during this and previous PRSC series. During the ICR
mission, for example, each of the implementing agencies showed full awareness of the
PDO and intermediate indicators and was able to provide updated values for the
indicators if they were available. Government results reporting improved significantly as
the annual performance reports from the JBSF sector line ministries were more focused
and adhered to the JAF. The HLAM process itself was evidence of built M&E capacity.
The capacity existing at the end of the PRSC series was a cumulative result of the
previous PRSCs' capacity building efforts, and marked a substantial advance in M&E
performance since the PRSC 5-7 series.
41.    Utilization. The data was collected in a timely manner consistent with ministerial
timetables and tracked PDO progress with respect to improved service delivery and value
for money. The data was utilized to manage the reform program. For example, despite
governance problems elsewhere in the GOU, the results framework concluded that not
only were PRSC 9 conditions met, but also the promised impact was achieved according
to the results indicators, which compelled the disbursement of PRSC 9 after the HLAM
process. Overall, the M&E design, implementation and utilization benefited from a
renewed commitment by the GOU to take results measurement more seriously.
2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation:
42.    Bank support continues in the JBSF sectors although broad budget support will
not go forward for the time being.4 Other donors such as the EU will continue a program
of broad budget support. JBSF sectors are being supported by a series of
'transformational' investment projects, notably in the health and transport sectors.
Projects in the JBSF sectors include Transport Sector Development, Water Sector
Development and Management, Post Primary Education APL II, North-Eastern Corridor
Road Asset Management Project, Local Government and Capacity Building APL II, and
AF Health System Strengthening. The recent Service Delivery Indicators exercise5 has
established a baseline for several new indicators that, in the future, will help track
progress in dealing with key constraints in the health and education sectors.
4 As indicated in the CASPR (August 2013), the Bank still considers budget support among its instruments
of development assistance as long as a credible government-owned governance program is available.

﻿3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Overall relevance rating: Substantial
Objectives-Substantial
43.   The PRSC series objectives were relevant to the current CAS, which covers the
period July 1, 2010 to June 30, 2015 and reflects the priorities of the GOU's 2011-2015
National Development Plan. With Uganda's rapidly growing population, access to
services continues to be a priority national goal. It continues to be highly relevant to
developing ways to improve VFM in JBSF sectors as high inefficiency persists and the
opportunities for wasting money will much greater, as revenues from oil exports will be
available in the coming years. The PDO was broad, but was made more specific by the
PDO indicators and targets. One possible shortcoming was that the broadness of the PDO
might have left the impression that VFM and access were to be improved across the JBSF
sectors as a whole, rather than with respect only to the specific activities supported by the
PRSC series.
Design-Substantial
44.   The design of the PRSCs that emphasizes improved delivery of public services
with cross-cutting themes remains relevant to Uganda's current priorities. The JAF
approach also remains relevant and will continue to pay dividends in project and program
management. The Bank used the broader set of preconditions in the JAF to complement
the PRSC policy matrix to get commitment from GOU to implement jointly agreed
policies. This affiliation of the PRSC series with JAF meant that there was no need, for
example, to have a separate prior action on macroeconomic stability.
45.   The PER for 2013, Uganda-Service Delivery with More Districts in Uganda:
Fiscal Challenges and Opportunities for Reforms also provided evidence of current
design relevance by concluding: "overall, value-for-money in social sectors can be
increased by shifting funding from districts that are already well-served to districts that
are relatively under-served. Additional spending appears to have a greater impact where
current levels of spending are low; consequently, shifting resources to those areas will
have a larger effect on education and health outcomes." This reallocation was a major
component of the policy supported by PRSC 8-10, and so, it remains relevant to current
conditions in the country. The Service Delivery Indicators exercise provided further
evidence of design relevance in several of its key findings: i) Service delivery outcomes
are determined by the relationships of accountability between service providers and
citizens; ii) high teacher and health worker absenteeism and low 'at task' rates continue
to hamper service outcomes. The PRSC series promotion of performance contracts are
expected to further improve results indicators over time.
15


﻿46.    The CASPR proposed three adjustments to the country strategy to promote faster
growth and improve governance. i) emphasize transformational investment operations
including infrastructure (transport and hydro-power), and raise agricultural productivity;
ii) Use DPL in exceptional cases to promote governance or sectoral reforms; and iii)
broaden governance efforts including public finance and procurement management
systems and processes, strengthen country oversight institutions and promote
accountability mechanisms at the local level to deliver better services. The PRSC series
objectives and design and implementation are relevant to most of these new CASPR
emphases. The CASPR intensifies its focus on several key areas of the PRSC design. The
main difference is the CAS focus on transformational projects with less reliance on
budget support. In fact, the cancellation of the PRSC 10, as a budget support instrument,
was consistent with this new emphasis.
Implementation-Substantial
47.    With the cancellation of PRSC 10, it might be argued that the program became
less relevant over time. Indeed, budget support did become the less preferred mode of
development assistance amongst the development partners, as well as the GOU. Yet, the
policy actions remained relevant and were almost all implemented despite the fact that
PRSC 10 was never submitted for Board approval. The CASPR did point out that the
PRSC series could have incorporated aspects of the 'accountability chain,' including
detection, inspection and sanctions, which would help achieve better governance.
3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives
Achievement of Objectives rating: Moderately Satisfactory
PDO: Improved access to and greater value for money (VFM) in public services.
Policy Cluster 1: Reforms in Public Expenditure Management, Public Financial
Management and Procurement and Public Service Management that Improve
6
Service Delivery
(i)    Improved budget credibility-Achieved. Budget credibility was achieved
as measured by the budget variance within the JBSF sectors with a target of 5.0 percent
and an achievement of 3.4 percent in FY2008/09. The final ISR (July 2013) also states
that the 2011/12 budget was within 3.44 percent for the year. The ICR received additional
data showing that JBSF variation was only 1.83 percent between budget plan and budget
release for 2012/13. By ensuring funding levels of at least 95 percent, the PRSC series
6 The sub-objectives are expressed in broad terms and are made program-specific through their associated
indicators. For example, the assessment that the sub-objective "Transparent and efficient public financial
management" was achieved means that the specific prior actions of the PRSC series contributed to the
achievement of the targeted percentages of "clean audits" at three levels of government. It should not be
interpreted as the achievement of overall PFM transparency and efficiency, which was beyond the scope of
the PRSC series.
16


﻿prevented the previously common practice of short-changing public services and
preserved access to services, as planned in the budget.
(ii)  Transparent and efficient public financial management-Achieved. The
PRSC series focused on compliance with PFM regulations and measured success by the
institution of performance contracts for all financial officers. The indicator met clean
audit targets for three areas of government: Central (target=45%, actual=59%), Local
(Target=29%, actual=45%), and Statutory Bodies (Target=59%, actual=61%). With an
increase in the percentage of clean audits, the use of funds was more likely to be for its
intended purposes, and therefore promote greater access to and VFM in public services.
48.   Looking ahead to the accountability for oil and gas revenues in the coming years,
PRSC 10 trigger 3 has been completed. Draft amendments are currently being debated in
the Parliament. There are concerns in Parliament was that the new bill would reduce its
power because the former Budget Act would be dismantled.
(iii)  Transparent and efficient public procurement-Progress, but not
achieved. The PRSC 8 prior action was for the Government to agree on a procurement
performance indicator framework and pilot it in 15 Ministries, Departments and Agencies
(MDAs). PRSC 9 required that the MOFPED approve revised procurement
implementation regulations that are consistent with the revised PPDA Act (and meeting
international best practice) and submit them to Parliament. This action reflects a change
of language from the original trigger which called for the MOF to issue a full set of
Procurement Regulations and Guidelines. The Parliament intervened in this action by
requiring that the regulations receive Parliamentary approval prior to their issuance by the
MOFPED.
49.   The procurement performance indicator combined the two actions: the percentage
of contracts with complete procurement records in compliance with PPDA regulations.
The target was 70.0 percent of all contracts and the actual achieved was 17.1 percent
(The Third Annual Report on Tracking Corruption Trends in Uganda: Using the Data
Tracking Mechanism-December 2012). The reason for the low percentage was a single,
but quite important category of records, the contract implementation plan, which was
found in only 17.1 percent of procurement record sets. The next lowest category was
"Evidence of contract completion" which was 60.2 percent. The 10 other categories of
procurement records had compliance rates of 81.5 percent or higher. Despite the low
compliance in one category, the action was a valuable improvement in public
procurement, because previously there was not adequate data to measure procurement
performance. Now, at least, the government can pinpoint where compliance issues lie.
This action also helps with another PRSC action of aligning procurement plans with work
plans and vice-versa, which in turn, produce more accurate quarterly budget estimates.
The PRSC 10 trigger that the PPDA issue revised Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs)
are ready for issuance upon publication of the regulations, and is expected to improve
efficiency and transparency in public procurement by meeting international best practices
for SBDs.
17


﻿(iv)  Strengthened public sector management and accountability-Achieved.
In addition to performance contracts described above, public sector management and
accountability was promoted by better aligning work plans, procurement plans and cash
flow in the line ministries. The indicator for this sub-objective was 'employees whose
computerized HR processes related to pay are managed by the employer.' The target of
50 percent was far exceeded as 96 percent coverage (October 31, 2013) has been reached.
One of the key benefits of this action was to have better controls and to be able to link
one person to one job and eliminate the phenomenon of "ghost workers." During the ICR
mission, it was reported that the linking of work plans, procurement plans and cash flow
helped staff have a better understanding of their role in their organization.
50.   Progress was also made with respect to a fiscally sustainable pay reform strategy.
Under PRSC 10, trigger 5, a new sanctions and rewards framework was developed and
rolled out. MOFPED agreed with the Ministry of Public Service that because of resource
constraints not all the pay enhancement proposals in the transformation paper could be
met. There was agreement in principle that a decision on pay enhancements would be
done on an annual basis and included in MTEF based on funds availability (an example
of this is ongoing negotiations with teachers and medical workers). PRSC 10 trigger 6
was met and the citizen participation framework was to be concluded under PRSC 10. It
is currently under implementation in the Education Sector.
(v)   Strengthened local government system for service delivery-Achieved.
The main indicator here was 'Local Governments publishing financial transfers and
budgets at local level', which was met with an actual of 100 percent against a target of 90
percent and a 2008 baseline of 48 percent. This achievement is a significant stride
forward in transparency because it lets the public know the amount of resources that local
governments have to provide services. With this information, the public is better
positioned to insist on value for money.
Policy Cluster 2: Improving Value for Money in Public Service Delivery Sectors
(i)   Wider access to and better quality of primary and secondary
education-Achieved. To improve access and quality of primary and secondary education,
the PRSC helped institute performance contracts for head teachers and the development
and implement an allocation formula to remedy the mal-distribution of teachers between
districts.
51.   The PDO indicators which captured the quality of education services were:
*  Primary pupils passing PLE with grades I-III at public primary schools-Target
280,000, actual 317,353.
*  Girls in public primary school passing PLE with grades I-III-Target 46.0, Actual
48.1.
52.   The intermediate indicator targets for each of these measures were also met:
18


﻿*  Increased percentage of teachers at task (lower absenteeism) in the 12 districts
with the worst education indicators-Primary-70% target, 77% actual.
*  Reduced vacancy rates for teachers in HTS (Primary)-No target, Actual 10%,
compared with 12.75% baseline, (Secondary)-Target 60%, Actual 61%.
53.   In the case of secondary teachers the vacancy target was modest, beginning from
a baseline of 65 percent. The reason for this caution was that there were not going to be
additional resources in the sector and so the objective was basically to hold the line on
vacancy rates. Because of the allocation formula further reductions in vacancy rates in
HTS are expected. With more teachers present and accountable, the value to students for
a given education expenditure improves. With higher absentee and vacancy rates the
value for money is less. Despite the challenges in lagging Districts, the indicator targets
for education were met; vacancy rates were lowered and the percentage of teachers at
task increased.
(ii)  Wider access to and better quality of health services-Progress, but not
achieved. The PRSCs dealt with a similar uneven distribution in the health sector, with
too many health care workers in some districts and not enough in others. PRSC 8
addressed this problem with a prior condition to establish human resources for a health
MIS, which would provide the necessary data to reallocate workers more efficiently and
therefore improve VFM in service delivery. The PRSC 9 action addressed the problem of
local governments diverting their budgets for medicines to other purposes. The action
called for an MOU between the MOH, the MOLG and the NMS to include a performance
framework for the distribution of essential medicines by NMS. The action represents a
revision of the trigger which called for developing and implementing guidelines for
distribution of essential drugs.
54.   Wider access to and better quality of health services was measured by:
*  DPT3 immunization-Target-90%, actual-87%     (Health Sector Performance
Review-6/30/13).
55.   There was improvement in three of four intermediate indicators, though continued
improvement is needed to meet the targets:
*  Vacancy rates for health staff in HTS locations-Target-40.0%, Actual-41.0%
(against a baseline of 41.9%)
*  Proportion of approved posts filled by qualified health workers-Target-65.0,
Actual-58.0% (baseline 51 %)
*  Absenteeism rate-Target 25%, Actual 48% (baseline 31 percent)
* Proportion of health facilities without drug stock-outs for tracer drugs-Target
65%, actual 53% (baseline 28 percent)
56.   The targets for vacancy rates in HTS also reflected a hold-the-line view as the
target envisioned only a slight improvement. One disconcerting indicator is that the
19


﻿absenteeism rate increased sharply. Several factors could explain this trend. First, access
and amenities are still lacking in HTS areas. Also, the Government has been irregular in
paying supplements HTS areas.
(iii)  Improved water and sanitation system-PDO Achieved, one intermediate
indicator lagging. This objective was to be achieved by establishing i) water user
communities in the Districts; and ii) water user bodies and piloting private contracting for
daily maintenance of WfP facilities. These measures would ensure improved access to
the public service of water supply and sanitation. The indicators used to measure progress
were:
Improved water sources that are functional at the time of spot checks-Valley
Tanks/Dams-Target 30%, actual 71% (from a baseline of 23%).
One intermediate indicator was met, the other was not:
*  People accessing hand washing with soap facilities-Target 29.0%, actual 29.0%
against a baseline of 14%.
*  Pupil to latrine/toilet stance ratio in schools (and hand washing facilities)-Target
50:1, actual 70:1 (from a baseline of 69:1, revised for 2011/12).
57.    The PDO targets were met and this did translate into a higher percentage of
people with access to hand washing facilities, but did not reach schools to the extent
envisioned at the outset. The difficulty in meeting this target underscores the difficulty in
meeting a target that cuts across sectors, water and education. It was reported that that the
pupil-teacher and pupil-classroom ratios and text books are higher priorities for the
Ministry of Education than equipping schools with sanitary facilities. Thus, it will take
longer for this target to be achieved.
(iv)   Improved    national  road   network   to  lower   transport   cost, raise
competitiveness and facilitate economic activity-Mostly achieved. Improve road
service was to be achieved by ensuring that: i) the Road Fund had appointed a Director;
ii) there was a policy on strengthening the national construction industry; iii) data on
national, district and other roads was collected and an M&E framework established; and
iv) UNRA had obtained procurement accreditation from PPDA.
58.    The PDO indicator recorded progress, and came close, but did not fully meet its
target:
Paved roads in fair to good condition-Target 80%, actual 77% from a baseline of 65%
59.    Two of the four intermediate indicators were met:
*  Funds released to UNRA on time (as per performance agreement)-Target 95%,
actual 100% (met).
20


﻿*  Expenditure for maintenance works executed by the private sector. National
roads-Target 80%, actual 75% (met-against a baseline of 89%).
*  Expenditure for maintenance works executed by the private sector, DUCAR
roads-Target 0%, actual 83.1 percent (not met, no baseline).
*  Overloaded vehicles-Target 5%, actual 54% (not met-against a baseline of
60%)
60.   The PRSC series had originally intended to support an increase in the share of
private sector works. However, GOU subsequently purchased maintenance equipment
which needed to be used so private sector share would decrease during PRSC series.
Regarding the trigger for PRSC 10, UNRA's request for procurement accreditation to
implement an Independent and Parallel Bid Evaluation (IPBE) process was approved by
the PPDA Board on October 20, 2011. This approval forms the basis for DFID to
conclude the selection of consultants to provide the IPBE services that began in March
2012. The services are for two years, ending in February 2014.
61.   Six of the nine sub-objectives are assessed to be fully achieved, with one mostly
achieved. In many cases the indicator targets were exceeded. In cases where some of the
targets were not met, such as health and procurement, there was still meaningful progress.
Thus, overall achievement of PDOs is substantial.
3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Ratings: Moderately Satisfactory
62.   With the program remaining substantially relevant in terms of its objectives,
design, and implementation, and a moderately satisfactory achievement of objectives, the
overall outcome rating is moderately satisfactory.
3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
63.   The program targeted poorer areas that were hard to serve (HTS) to reduce
vacancy rates for teachers and health workers and teacher at task rates in the 12 Districts
with the weakest education indicators. These indicators were met or were close to being
met, so pro-poor impacts are expected. On gender, the target value for the indicator for
percent of girls passing PLE with grades I-III was also met. With the transparency of LG
expenditures improved, better access and VFM benefits are expected to reach non-urban
populations. Citizens at the District level will be empowered by the knowledge of what
District governments actually spend money on.
21


﻿(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
64.   The PRSC 8-10 series demonstrated some of the long-run benefits built from a
decade of PRSCs. In the PRSC8-10 series the GOU went quickly from piloting important
changes such as performance contracts, HR processes managed by employers,
transparency of LG expenditures, to government-wide coverage. This phenomenon
shows that, over time, the GOU has developed initiative and independence and can carry
reforms and process changes forward nimbly and without the constant nudging of
development partners. There are still exceptions, such as in procurement reforms where
resistance is still difficult. There are also the governance challenges that disrupted the
disbursement of PRSC funds.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
65.   The GOU's expansion of processes such as performance contracts, publishing of
LG expenditures, etc., (mentioned above) was one positive but not necessarily expected
outcome. A negative unintended outcome was the inability to achieve budget
predictability because of the delays in PRSC 8 and 9, and the cancellation of PRSC 10.
3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
N.A.
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
66.   Because of the governance challenges that arose late in the PRSC series, it would
be tempting to rate the risk to development outcome as substantial. When the PRSC
operation and its achievements are more closely examined, it is apparent that the
corruption scandal had nothing to do with the actions of the PRSC series, and, therefore,
did not pose a direct threat to sustainability.
67.   Government risk mitigation of corruption. As part of the resumption of the
dialogue between the Government of Uganda and Development Partners, following the
misappropriation of funds in the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM), a joint review of
Government's performance in the fiscal year 2011/12 took place on October 3, 2013. The
review was part of a meeting of the Policy Coordination Committee (PCC) and the
Development Partners' Policy Committee. GOU's performance in the fiscal year
2011/2012 was jointly assessed by development partners and found satisfactory. The
review concluded:
68.   "Government has improved and strengthened the security of the Public Finance
Management processes under the Integrated Financial Management System. This
capacity building process will be sustained. Government has also fully constituted the
Office of the Inspector General of Government which is now fully operational. The
appointment of the Director of Public Prosecution has been concluded and is now in
22


﻿office. Police have undertaken extensive investigations in the affected Ministries,
Departments and Agencies and are working with the Office of the DPP to ensure that
those suspected to have committed crime are charged in courts of law."
69.   The World Bank Country Manager and Co-Chair of the Joint Budget Support
group of ten development partners (the World Bank, the European Union, and the
Governments of Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, and
the United Kingdom) also noted:
70.   "Despite a reduction in sector performance both in terms of indicators and actions
when compared to Financial Year 2010/2011, a majority of targets remain on track.
Notable achievements include strengthened budgeting in the water sector, improved
procurement practices in central government, and increased immunization rates. In
addition, the assessment presents a clear picture: the strengthening of public financial
management, and the ongoing fight against corruption remain areas where Government
and Development Partners must continue to work together."
71.   Government commitment to PRSC        policies. Another factor supporting
sustainability is the fact that the GOU including the MOFPED, the Ministry of Public
Service and the line Ministries independently expanded the coverage of actions supported
by the PRSCs to cover the entire government. They also completed almost all of the
PRSC 10 triggers despite the fact that the operation was dropped, which is evidence of a
strong level of GOU commitment to the program.
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
72.   There was a tremendous preparation effort by the Bank to improve the results
framework through the JAF and donor coordination through JBSF compared with that of
the previous PRSC series. The preparation effort included a strong effort to address
sectoral as well as cross sectoral impediments to service delivery (Annex 7). The
analytical work was comprehensive and relevant to country priorities. These elements
produced an operation that showed a high level of clarity regarding the PDO, the linkages
between prior actions and results indicators, and the types of actions that dealt with
binding constraints, for which Uganda was ready, despite the challenging nature of some
of the actions. One shortcoming was the belief that budget support would afford a high
degree of budget predictability, which was an unrealistic expectation. The Bank also
worked assiduously with other development partners and helped keep the design of the
operation from being broader than it otherwise would have been. For example, the Bank
wanted to focus on four sectors and leave the agriculture and energy sectors to be
addressed by investment operations and knowledge services.
23


﻿(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
73.   Supervision was challenging, partly because of efforts to maintain the high level
of donor coordination. Supervision was regular with a full contingent of country office
staff and TTL covering all relevant sectors of the PRSCs and monitoring progress on a
daily basis. Key decision points were handled appropriately. The Bank maintained a
tough, but flexible stance on several of the prior conditions, e.g., those effecting
procurement and civil service reform by being flexible on trigger language. The most
important decision point revolved around the corruption scandal in the PM's office. The
Bank intensively engaged the GOU in the development of the HLAM and, appropriately,
postponed PRSC-9 disbursement. Once the HLAM was satisfactorily completed, the
Bank, over some development partner dissent, released PRSC 9 funds. However, the
climate was poor for another US$100 million of general budget support. By mutual
agreement between the Bank and the GOU, PRSC 10 was dropped, although its
identification mission was already completed. The GOU continued to fulfill six of the
eight PRSC 10 triggers which the Bank monitored through the results framework.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
74.   The Bank performed well in preparing the PRSC 8-10 series and reacted well to
changing circumstances during its implementation. Because the Bank performance for
quality at entry was rated moderately satisfactory and Bank performance of quality of
supervision was rated satisfactory, the overall Bank performance is rated moderately
satisfactory in accordance with the harmonized evaluation criteria guidelines for ICRs.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
75.   The PM office with the help of the MOF performed well as a designer, negotiator
and implementer of the PRSC series. All prior actions were met. MOFPED was proactive
and responsive. For example, with respect to PFM MOFPED actively pursued global
good practice examples and incorporated them into the design of PFM legislation. The
PM office had staff that were committed to results and results measurement, which led
not only to an improved results framework for the PRSC series, but also much improved
reporting by the line ministries on their annual performance.
76.   One shortcoming was that there were some delays in meeting agreed prior
actions, and, as noted earlier, to facilitate implementation, trigger language was modified
in some instances to facilitate implementation as prior actions. Another shortcoming,
though separate from the PRSC series, was that the PM office created serious concerns
about VFM with the misuse of funds in another project. The GOU responded well to the
corruption scandal and engaged the Bank effectively through the HLAM process which
24


﻿ended the postponement of the disbursement of PRSC 9. In implementing the HLAM, the
GOU demonstrated an ability to remedy governance issues in other parts of the GOU.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
77.   Implementing agencies generally engaged well in the policy dialog and completed
actions agreed in the program. There was a range of IA performances with the, MOFPED
(also considered an implementing agency), the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Local
Government and the PFM Reform Secretariat (FINMAP Secretariat) performing well and
carrying out their responsibilities fully under the program. FINMAP was chaired by a
reform champion who facilitated implementation. The Ministry of Education also
fulfilled its responsibilities, but could have coordinated better on the actions relating to
school sanitation. The Ministry of Public Service and the PPDA had some challenging
cross-cutting actions to complete and did experience some delays, but otherwise
performed reasonably well. The Ministry of Water and Environment performed well,
while the Ministry of Works and Transport had somewhat of a mixed performance as it
struggled to establish the results framework, though eventually succeeding. Transport had
lagged behind other line ministries in establishing a foundation of data needed for
program planning.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
78.   The overall rating is a blend of performance that exceeded expectations in
expanding reforms along with difficulties in achieving other reforms and subsequent
delays. Because the Government performance was moderately satisfactory and
implementing agency performance was rated moderately satisfactory, the overall
Borrower performance is rated moderately satisfactory in accordance with the
harmonized evaluation criteria guidelines for ICRs.
6. Lessons Learned
79.   Spending staff time on ensuring an appropriate JAF up front greatly
facilitates program management and assessment of achievement of program
objectives. Intensive coordination efforts with development partners paid off in terms of
a results framework that could be used for program tracking and management. The
flowchart in Annex 8 provides an example of an effective tool to help coordinate the
dialog with counterparts and development partners in building a results framework.
80.   Achieving broad cooperation amongst development partners complicates the
country dialog by introducing many considerations that are particular to
development partner's country. The Bank expended a great deal of energy balancing
concerns of bilateral development partners. While these concerns did not significantly
affect the PRSC supported policies, it was a real cost to deal with political concerns that
were not germane to Uganda's country priorities.
25


﻿81.   The benefits of the JBSF probably outweigh the costs of developing it, but it
is a fairly close balance. Clearly there were benefits with respect to the results
framework. In addition, there were significant benefits to the GOU by lowering the
transactions costs of dealing with many development partners. The level of resources for
technical assistance through TASU was also significantly higher than it would have been
had the Bank not used the JBSF to augment resources. On the cost side, the cost to the
Bank was substantial in terms of staff time and resources and the Bank's hand was at
times weakened in dealing with the Government as it sought consensus amongst its
fellow development partners.
82.   With the difficulties in achieving procurement reforms, quick and focused
gains should be considered. Innovations such as e-procurement and bulk purchases of
items across ministries through framework agreements may meet with less resistance.
Ministries are willing to give up a small portion of their procurement, more than they are
willing to concede changes to the procurement system as a whole. And these quick and
focused changes that can delivery quick results may make broader reforms easier in the
future.
83.   Budget support does not necessarily offer budget predictability. Although it
was believed that the PRSC budget support would deliver timely support synchronized
with the GOU budget cycle, like many DPLs, this series had prior conditions that were
challenging to meet and took longer than expected to fulfill. As a result, the PRSC series
funds were unpredictable with highly delayed disbursements (for good reasons),
including cancellation of nearly one-third of the total PRSC commitment. This often
posed challenges for the government to fit the PRSC conditions into the already
developed Ministerial programs. In addition, if budget support was late, the GOU would
also have to move resources to adjust to the shortfall in budget support. While this was a
lesson from the previous series, it did not play out.

﻿Annex 7. Letter for MOFPED Explaining to Ministries the Purpose of the JBSF
Workshop May 2009
TO: MOE, MoH, MoWE, MoLG, PPDA, AG, MoPS, MoWT (and any others as
government see fit)
Re: Joint Budget Support Framework Workshop on May 6, 2009
During the upcoming JBSF mission (please see meeting schedule in Annex 1), JBSF
development partners and government will work together in a JBSF Results chain
workshop. The workshop will take place at Serena Hotel, on May 6, 2009, from 9.00 am
to 5:30 pm as per attached program (Annex 2).
Pursuant to subsequent discussions of the Joint Budget Support Framework (JBSF) and
the specific sector Results framework, the World Bank is inviting you to participate in a
The JBSF will provide budget support and means through which Government's
development partners will harmonize their approaches to the provision of such support.
The purpose of the workshop is to ensure that draft results frameworks for JAF 1-3
(FY1O-12) are coherent, consistent and logical and reflect a holistic view of the
impediments to service delivery performance in the sector. They will therefore also
importantly also discuss cross cutting issues such as procurement, PSM, PFM, and
decentralization issues that can affect service delivery. The results chain workshop will
help identify the most binding constraints to service delivery performance and the
associated high priority actions to take to resolve them. Eventually, the goal of the
workshop is to complete on the final results frameworks for JAF 1 - 3 and also show the
thrust of the reform strategy throughout JAF 5. This will set the stage for subsequent
implementation of the JBSF in this period.
Participants from each sector are only required to participate during the specific sector
session dealing with the relevant issue (health, education, water and sanitation, transport).
Each sector ministry is requested to prepare a short presentation (maximum 10
minutes). identifying the key impediments to effective service delivery. The
presentation should include impediments stemming from cross cutting issues such as (a)
public sector management, (b) public financial management, (c) procurement and (d)
local government/decentralization. It could also (e) include suggested reform measures to
the identified cross cutting and sector specific impediments. The sector ministry can use
the attached matrix (Annex 3) to frame the presentation. Annexes 4 and 5 could be useful
for Ministry of Education and for representatives from agencies covering cross
Participants from institutions covering crosscutting issues (e.g. MoLG, AG, PPDA,
MoPS) are requested to participate during the entire workshop. In particular,
representatives from cross cutting sectors are requested to carefully consider
impediments to effective service delivery in the four sectors mentioned.
36


﻿Follow up meetings are scheduled for May 7th as well as on May 13th. The main focus of
the follow up meetings is agreeing on the key cross cutting issues, the prior actions and
core indicators for individual sectors. Meeting venue would be in the respective sector
ministry.
