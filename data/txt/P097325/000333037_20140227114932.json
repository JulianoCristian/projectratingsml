risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            spending staff time on ensuring an appropriate JAF up front\n            greatly facilitates program management and assessment of\n            achievement of program objectives. Intensive coordination\n            efforts with development partners paid off in terms of a\n            results framework that could be used for program tracking\n            and management. The flowchart in Annex 8 provides an example\n            of an effective tool to help coordinate the dialog with\n            counterparts and development partners in building a results\n            framework. Achieving broad cooperation amongst development\n            partners complicates the country dialog by introducing many\n            considerations that are particular to development\n            partner's country. Innovations such as e-procurement\n            and bulk purchases of items across ministries through\n            framework agreements may meet with less resistance.\n            Ministries are willing to give up a small portion of their\n            procurement, more than they are willing to concede changes\n            to the procurement system as a whole. And these quick and\n            focused changes that can delivery quick results may make\n            broader reforms easier in the future."}, "docdt": "2014-01-27T00:00:00Z"}
