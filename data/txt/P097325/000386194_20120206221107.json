the Ninth\n            Poverty Reduction Support Credit Program (PRSC 9) for Uganda\n            is to improved access to and greater value for money (VFM)\n            in, public services. This program document presents a credit\n            to the Republic of Uganda for SDR 65.2 million or US$100\n            million equivalent to finance the PRSC 9. It is the second\n            of three development policy operations (DPOs) to support\n            Uganda's National Development Plan (NDP) and covers the\n            period 2012-13. The PRSC 9 is prepared under the Joint\n            Budget Support Framework (JBSF). The operation will improve\n            efficiency in four service delivery sectors by addressing\n            common key binding implementation constraints in public\n            financial management (PFM), public service management and\n            public administration, in tandem with sector-specific\n            reforms within health, education, water and sanitation and\n            transport. The PRSC 9 builds upon reforms initiated under\n            the first (PRSC 8) operation of the series and provides the\n            foundation for further reforms supported under the final\n            operation of the series (PRSC 10). PRSC 9 focuses on two\n            policy clusters: 1) reforms in public expenditure\n            management, public financial management and public service\n            management that improve service delivery and 2) value for\n            money in public service delivery sectors. Measures supported\n            by the operation include: improved budget credibility; more\n            transparent and efficient public financial and sector\n            management, focusing on accountability and improved service\n            delivery systems at the local government level that should\n            lead to better quality of education and health services."}, "docdt": "2012-01-30T00:00:00Z"}
