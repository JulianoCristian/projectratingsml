      moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was high, the Bank performance was unsatisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: for many producers, credit, especially\n            long-term credit to finance part of irrigation\n            rehabilitation, is not the appropriate instrument. As the\n            first order of business, an irrigation project has to\n            demonstrate to farmers that the volume and quality of their\n            products (and thus income) will be enhanced through a given\n            operation before farmers commit to the objective of the\n            project. High costs investments on equipment and facilities\n            should only be undertaken once ownership, operations and\n            management have been well settled. Otherwise there is the\n            real possibility, as was the case under PDIAIM I and II,\n            that the equipment and facilities will not be used (case of\n            facility in Rosso) or for completely different purposes\n            (case of Nouakchott where the project financed a cold\n            storage facility that was intended for vegetables to be\n            exported and is now being used to conserve fish).\n            Satisfactory disbursement figures can be misleading as they\n            may hide significant cost overruns, as was the case for\n            irrigation rehabilitation under this project. In addition,\n            APLs, by their very nature, have disbursement categories\n            that are broad and not easy to match disbursements with\n            quantitative achievement of physical outputs."}, "docdt": "2014-11-26T00:00:00Z"}
