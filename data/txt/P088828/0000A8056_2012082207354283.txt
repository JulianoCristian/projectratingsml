                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of Phase II of the APL is three-fold: (i) consolidate key incentive measures, (ii) increase sustainable irrigation schemes, and (iii) intensify
                         agricultural diversification for targeted actors engaged in irrigated agriculture. These objectives build on the results achieved and lessons learned during Phase I to
                         further the objective of the overall three-phase APL.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         been met, and project disbursement rate is above 98%. However, the overall implementation status of the project remains moderately satisfactory because of low level of

                         additional financing to take place during that period was approved before June 30, 2012.
                         The triggers necessary for a third phase of this 3-phase APL won't be achieved because of two indicators that are not met: land tenure legislation and agricultural credit efficiency.
                         The Government has failed to conduct on time the land tenure study to ensure that irrigation land concessions are awarded according to land tenure legislation and land use
