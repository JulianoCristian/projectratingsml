                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The irrigation and diversification activities of the PDIAIM2 project were closed on September 30, 2012. The Project reached by that date a total rehabilitated (irrigation) surface of
                         1,700 ha against a target of 5,000 ha planned at the beginning of the project. Target set for crop diversification was met. However, the overall implementation status of the project

                         remains moderately satisfactory because of low level of irrigation rehabilitation. Before this closing date of September 30, 2012, an additional financing was approved in August 2012
                         to improve availability of critical agricultural inputs and food staples for targeted beneficiaries within the context of the severe drought that affected the country. The corresponding two
                         grants (IDA and GFRP) were signed on September 12, 2012 and the additional financing became effective in December 2012. Active project components now only reflect the
                         proceedings of this additional financing: this includes the new Component E (Emergency and food price response) and Component D (Project administration) which was also

                         designed to prepare a new longer term investment operation in the agriculture sector (PASAM project). In June 2013, the Government asked for a restructuring of this additional
                         financing so as to (ii) cancel about half of the IDA Grant (since all livestock support activities had finally been self-financed by the government, given the urgency of the drought
                         situation) and to (ii) fund additional food staples for targeted rural beneficiaries using the Global Food Response Trust Fund (GFRP). This request was processed and agreed upon on
                         August 13, 2013. The project is currently on track to fully disburse all available resources by its closing date of February 28, 2014. The initial PDIAIM 2 Project was rated Moderately
                         Satisfactory (MS) in September 2012 when Irrigation activities were stopped. Procurement delays and M&E difficulties lead the Additional Financing of PDIAIM 2 to be rated MS as
                         well. Therefore, the overall project is rated MS.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Before the closing date of the original PDIAIM 2, the project completed the remaining civil works that straddled the rainy season and started preliminary studies for the rehabilitation of
                         the irrigation perimeter of Wandama (APS). The government also completed the new Mauritania rural development strategy which preparation was financed by the project. Since the
                         additional financing was approved, the new closing date is February 28, 2014 to implement activities related to the additional financing for the purchase of fertilizers, veterinary
                         products and cereals. While the government decided to self-finance agricultural inputs, the recent Project restructuring means external IDA and GFRP funding are used to procure
                         and deliver food staples to poor beneficiaries in selected rural communities, as well as for project administration. The additional financing also allows a few studies to be achieved (the
                         Wandama Irrigation Scheme Detailed Studies have been pursued -APD- and an evaluation of the Mauritania Safety Nets for Food Security is underway). The preparation of a future
                         new long term agriculture sector investment operation is now part of a regional water development program involving the Senegal River Basin Authority (PGIRE2).

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
