                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The irrigation and diversification activities of the PDIAIM2 project were closed on September 30, 2012. The Project reached by that date a total rehabilitated (irrigation) surface of
                         1,700 ha against a target of 5,000 ha planned at the beginning of the project. Target set for crop diversification was met. Before the closing date of major activities in September 30,

                         2012, an additional financing was approved in August 2012 to improve availability of critical agricultural inputs and food staples for targeted beneficiaries within the context of the
                         severe drought that affected the country. The corresponding two grants (IDA and GFRP) were signed on September 12, 2012 and the additional financing became effective in
                         December 2012.

                         Active project components now only reflect the proceedings of this additional financing: this includes the new Component E (Emergency and food price response) and Component D
                         (Project administration) which was also designed to assist in the preparation of longer term investments in the agriculture sector. In June 2013, the Government asked for a
                         Restructuring of the AF so as to: (i) cancel about half of the IDA Grant (since all livestock support activities had finally been self-financed by the government) ; and to (ii) fund
                         additional food staples for targeted rural beneficiaries using the Global Food Response Trust Fund (GFRP). This request was processed and agreed upon on August 13, 2013.
                         However, upon discovery of a mistake made in percentages set for categories 3 (purchase of Cereals) and 4 (Project Administration) between IDA and GFRP, there was a need for
                         another Restructuring of the AF, not only for funds to be disbursed as originally imagined but also to complete the purchase of an additional 4,500 T of wheat, which could not have
                         taken place without restructuring the AF. Hence, GoM submitted a request on January 23, 2014 to correct the mistake while also requesting a 3-month project closing date extension,
                         in order to complete activities while allowing additional time for possible repostings and processing of withdrawal authorizations. The Restructuring was quickly processed by the Bank
                         and GoM was notified about it on February 13, 2014. The project is currently on track to disburse available resources by its revised closing date of May 31, 2014.

                         The overall implementation status of the project was long rated "moderately satisfactory" because of low level of irrigation rehabilitation. The initial PDIAIM 2 Project was rated
                         Moderately Satisfactory (MS) in September 2012 when Irrigation activities were stopped. However, recent findings coming from an independent evaluation of irrigation and
                         diversification activities show that Project achievements show significant shortcomings that can only lead to a downgrade from MS to MU. As regards the AF, the former MS rating of
                         the Additional Financing (AF) of PDIAIM 2 remains valid, mainly due to M&E difficulties related to Component E. Since the AF includes a revised PDO different from the one of
                         PDIAIM II, this will imply a split evaluation in the Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) and therefore the ratings before the AF and the one related to the AF are
                         separated.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Before the closing date of the original PDIAIM 2, the project completed the remaining civil works that straddled the rainy season and started preliminary studies for the rehabilitation of
                         the irrigation perimeter of Wandama (APS). The government also completed the new Mauritania rural development strategy which preparation was financed by the project. Since the
                         Additional Financing (AF) was approved, the original closing date set to February 28, 2014 was revised to May 31, 2014 following a Level 2 Restructuring (received on January 23,
                         2014 and processed on February 13, 2014), mainly aimed at correcting an error made during first Level 2 Restructuring approved in August 2013 (which included incorrect
                         disbursement percentages that could not be used for categories 3 - purchase of Cereals - and 4 - Project Administration). While GoM decided to self-finance agricultural inputs, the
                         latest Level 2 Restructuring allows correct use of IDA and GFRP funding to procure and deliver additional food staples to poor beneficiaries in selected rural communities, as well as
                         for Project Administration costs to be incurred ; thereby allowing Project remaining funds to be disbursed. Authorization has also been granted to reallocate IDA funds from
                         disbursement Category 3 to Category 4 and the project is now on track to disburse available resources by its revised closing date of May 31, 2014. The AF allows a few studies to be
                         achieved (the Wandama Irrigation Scheme Detailed Studies have been pursued, and an evaluation of the Mauritania Safety Nets for Food Security has been conducted as well as an
                         independent evaluation of irrigation and diversification activities conducted under PDIAIM I and II). The preparation of the initially envisaged new long term agriculture sector
                         investment operation (PA-PDRI) has been dropped in September 2013 and canceled IDA financing from AF-PDIAIM2 as part of first Level 2 Restructuring has been reallocated to the
                         regional water development program involving the Senegal River Basin Authority (PGIRE2). However, the upcoming agriculture investment operation is the Regional Sahel

                         held in Mauritania May 3-8, 2014 immediately following the second meeting of the Regional Task Force on Pastoralism (TFRP) April 29-May 2, 2014). GoM has recently submitted its
                         own Completion Report of PDIAIM 2 and appointed a senior counterpart for the Bank's ICR exercise. An ICR preparation mission for PDIAIM 2 has already taken place April 15-25,
                         2014.
