F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The development objectives of the project are to: (i) consolidate key incentive measures,
(ii) increase sustainable irrigation schemes, and (iii) intensify agricultural diversification
for targeted actors engaged in irrigated agriculture.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

The original PDO was not revised. However, the Emergency Project Paper indicated a
new PDO for the AF operation without revising the original PDO: “The objective of the
project is to improve availability of critical agricultural inputs and food staples for
targeted beneficiaries”.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.      PDIAIM II activities were mainly focused on the irrigation sector. On the other
hand all activities of the Additional Financing were focused on the emergency drought
response except for some studies destined for the medium term support to the agriculture
sector project planned then. When the AF was approved most of the activities of PDIAIM
II were already completed (activities of the latter ended as of 30 September 2012).
Therefore, even if technically they constitute one project, given the nature of their
activities PDIAIM II and the AF are evaluated, in the ICR, as “two” distinct operations
with the final ratings reflecting their respective size and duration.
1.1 Context at Appraisal
2.      At appraisal, Mauritania’s first priority with respect to irrigated agriculture was to
promote the rehabilitation of degraded irrigation schemes still under production, together
with the extension of collective schemes in which family plots were too small to
adequately cover the family’s subsistence needs. Moreover, the policy instruments
developed by the Government—Letter of Development Policy for Irrigated Agriculture
(1999), Rural Development Strategy (2001), and Agro-Food Strategy (2001) also the
cornerstone of the pillar 2 of the Poverty Reduction Strategy or PRSP’s – that constituted
its long-term shared vision of turning the Senegal River Valley into one of the main
sources of development and economic growth, were still valid. Both for the Government
and the Bank, the Integrated Program for Irrigated Agriculture in Mauritania (PDIAIM) 1
was still considered as the most appropriate instrument to implement the Government’s
long-term policy for irrigated agriculture and support to its rural development strategy
and the Bank’s FY03-05 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Mauritania. Phase 1
contributed to alleviating a number of the constraints identified at the initiation of the
program, namely: correction of the domestic rice support policies, facilitating access to
financing, support to land registrations, institutions of sound construction norms and
standards for the rehabilitation of the irrigation schemes, and providing capacity building
for the project implementing entities. Phase 2 was therefore meant to consolidate the
progress achieved during phase 1 especially, as stated in the PAD, “to address those
deep-rooted constraints of irrigated agriculture in Mauritania”.
3.     The rationale for Bank support was that all triggers for moving from phase 1 to 2
were met. The project was fully aligned with the CAS and the strategy for poverty
reduction (PRSP) for Mauritania and it was designed to complement other Bank-
supported operations, namely: the FY04 Community-based Rural Development Project
(CBRD, which targeted poor villages mainly located in the rainfed areas), the FY06
Capacity Building Project (which targeted the strengthening of management capacities,
good governance and environmental management), and the planned FY07 Transport
Sector Project, in the pipeline at the time.


1
 At the inception of PDIAIM in the mid-1990s only 40,000 ha were developed in the 1970s and 1980s
(primarily for rice production) out of the potential of 135,000 ha of irrigated land in the Valley. Therefore,
apart from increasing the value-added of irrigated agriculture and related incomes and employment in the
Senegal River Valley, the Program was expected to rehabilitate over 20,000 ha, including 13,000 ha with
support from IDA.

Context at Appraisal – Additional Financing (AF)
4.     In 2011 the Sahel experienced a severe drought, with Mauritania being one of the
countries that was hit badly. According to the World Food Program (WFP), about 25
percent of households (or about 700,000 people) in rural areas were food insecure 2 and
the Eastern and Southern parts of the country were the mostly affected regions.
Furthermore, the increase in commodity world prices, notably for wheat, maize, sugar
and oils (wheat and rice being the most important commodities for the majority of
Mauritanians) was eroding consumers’ purchasing power.
5.      As a response to this crisis, the Government prepared an Emergency Plan
estimated at about US$157 million, to be implemented during 2012. This plan named
EMEL (Hope in Arabic) included three main components: (i) preventing human food
insecurity through free food distribution and access to subsidized food, (ii) providing
health care for vulnerable groups and children, and (iii) preserving livestock through
imported feed supply, animal health measures and access to water points. The
Government expected to fund up to US$83 million while it planned to raise US$74
million from donors. It was within this context that it introduced to the Bank its request
of January 16, 2012, by which it was seeking the Bank’s support for a US$10 million
emergency support not only to contribute to the EMEL plan through rural food safety
stocks and livestock health support, but also to provide fertilizer support for rice
intensification. In addition, during the same period, the Government completed the
Mauritania National Food Security (SNSA) and validated its National Agriculture and
Food Security Investment Program (PNIA/SA) under CAADP; following this the
Government submitted its second request of March 22, 2012, seeking the Bank’s
assistance for a longer term investments in the irrigation sector. It was in response to
these requests, that the Bank processed the Additional Financing.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)
6.      The objectives of the project 3 were to: (i) consolidate key incentive measures for
irrigated agriculture, (ii) increase sustainable irrigation schemes, and (iii) intensify
agricultural diversification.
7.      The key outcome indicators for Phase II were: (i) regional land registries allow
verification of transparent irrigated land awards on request; (ii) the rural credit agency
UNCACEM (National Union of Agricultural Cooperatives for Savings and Credit)
maintains financial self-sufficiency; (iii) sustainable irrigation schemes are increased by
5,000ha by the end of Phase II; and (iv) irrigated area under diversified crops has doubled
by the end of Phase II.
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

  The overall development objective of the Program was to increase the value-added of irrigated
agriculture and related incomes and employment in the Senegal River valley through the judicious use of
the country’s most precious natural assets: water and arable land.


                                                   2
8.       The original PDO was not revised. Following the drought of 2011 and as a
response to the Government’s request, in July 2012, the Bank approved an additional
financing of US$10 million (US$5 million equivalent IDA grant and US$5 million from
the Food Price Crisis Response Core Multi-donor Trust Fund, GFCRP). The Emergency
Project Paper indicated a new PDO for the AF operation without revising the original
PDO, namely, “The objective of the project is to improve availability of critical
agricultural inputs and food staples for targeted beneficiaries”. In addition the following
two PDO-level indicators were established: (a) Direct Project beneficiaries (number), of
which females (percentage); and (b) Direct Project beneficiaries disaggregated by type of
benefit (fertilizer, livestock treatment, food staples) and by gender.
1.4 Main Beneficiaries
Original Project
9.       The main beneficiaries 4 for PDIAIM II were some 20,000 small-scale growers of
irrigated crops (rice and vegetables) organized in cooperatives along the Senegal River
who benefitted from irrigation rehabilitation, agricultural extension advice, land titling
activities, access to seasonal production credit and a better organized rice value chain.
Some 1,000 of them were women farmers mostly producing vegetable crops. The project
also benefitted certain units of SONADER (National Rural Development Corporation)
and supported research activities of CNRADA (National Agricultural Research and
Development Center). UNCACEM received technical assistance and a line of credit. The
Ministry of Rural Development and Environment (MDRE) received institutional support
with special emphasis on its Department of Policies, Cooperation and Monitoring and
Evaluation, and its Bureau des Affaires Foncières (BAF, responsible for land affairs). In
the initial years, several exporters of agricultural products were also supported, but in
2011 the focus of the Project was changed to the local market and remained as such until
the end of the project. And according to the Independent Evaluation Report, another
important beneficiary category was the rural and urban population (all rice consumers)
that benefitted from increased rice production and better quality of rice. In addition there
were other indirect beneficiaries, including the rural and urban labor force (due to the
increased job opportunities created by project related activities), private entrepreneurs
(engaged in the supply of agricultural inputs, equipment rental, manufacture/repair of
agricultural equipment), those involved in engineering and consulting, etc.
Additional Financing
10.    With the additional financing PDIAIM II’s intervention area was extended to an
additional six (6) administrative regions 5 with targeted direct beneficiaries of 279,000
people (of which 40 percent female).
1.5 Original Components
11.     The project consisted of four components, namely:


4
  The intervention areas of PDIAIM II were in the administrative regions of Trarza, Brakna, Gorgol,
Guidimaka.
5
  The Project intervened in the 10 administrative regions affected by the drought emergency situation,
namely: Trarza, Brakna, Gorgol, Guidimaka, Hodh Chargi, Hodh Gharbi, Assaba, Tagant, Adrar, Inchiri.


                                                  3
12.      Component A: Rural Incentives and Capacity Building – (US$3.5 million of
which IDA: US$ 2.76 million equivalent) to consolidate the policy measures and
incentives initiated during Phase I and improve the capacity of national and regional rural
institutions to implement the Program. It focused primarily on: (i) support and capacity
building activities to improve: (a) registration of land; (b) collection and analysis of
annual agricultural statistics; (c) ability of public and private entities to deliver services to
agricultural producers; and (d) UNCACEM’s organizational and institutional capacities;
and (ii) analytical work related to the development of a rural finance expansion strategy.
13.      Component B: Infrastructure for Irrigated Agriculture – (US$24.88 million
of which IDA: US$21.11 million equivalent). This was the largest component with
more than 50 percent allocation of the total project resources. It was primarily aimed at
continuing support and technical assistance for the development of private and public
irrigation schemes through: (i) the provision of grants and sub-loans to cooperatives and
individuals involved in the production of rice and in agricultural diversification for the
financing of their long-term investments for the rehabilitation, extension and creation of
private irrigation schemes; (ii) the construction of priority public infrastructure identified
during Phase I of the Program; and (iii) the carrying out of research and feasibility studies.
14.     Component C: Support to Agricultural Supply Chains – (US$10.94 million of
which IDA US$9.15 million equivalent). This component was to provide the necessary
assistance to the development of a competitive rice subsector and a diversified
agricultural base, targeting rice and horticultural supply chain participants engaged in
domestic and export markets. It included three sub-components: (i) C1: Support to Basic
Farm Management; (ii) C2: Support to the Rice Subsector; and (iii) C3: Support to
commercial farmers and entrepreneurs engaged in agricultural diversification.
15.     Component D: Project Administration – (US$7.34 million of which IDA:
US$5.98 million equivalent). This component was to ensure coordination of project
activities, the monitoring of activities and evaluation of impacts, and the implementation
of the social and environmental safeguards. It included three sub-components: (i) D1:
Project Management and Coordination; (ii) D2: Monitoring and Evaluation; and (iii) D3:
Environmental and Social Safeguard Measures.
1.6 Revised Components
16.     With the approval of the US$10 million Additional Financing in July 2012, a new
component was added to the project, namely Component E: Emergency and Food Price
Response. This component included two sub-components: (i) E1: Agricultural and
Livestock Productivity Enhancement (IDA Grant of US$2 million equivalent and US$3
million of GFRP Grant), for the supply and distribution of subsidized urea for irrigated
rice intensification, as well as the supply of veterinary products and the sanitary treatment
of livestock, including vaccination; and (ii) E2: Support to Food Safety Net (IDA Grant
of US$2 million equivalent and US$2 million of GFRP Grant), for the consolidation of
the existing network of Stocks Alimentaires Villageois de Sécurité (SAVS), through the
initial distribution or replenishment of cereal stocks for a selected number of SAVS
serving vulnerable rural communities.
17.  The remaining balance of the AF (US$1 million) was added to Component D of
PDIAIM II (project management) with a focus on the administration of new activities


                                               4
under Component E, but funds were also made available to undertake studies aimed at
assessing options to improve Mauritania's preparedness in dealing with food insecurity.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Original Project
19.     At the time of project preparation, the overall objective of the three-phase APL
was still relevant, and like the first phase, the second phase was considered responsive to
the Borrower’s development priorities and the Bank’s strategy for Mauritania. The
Government still considered PDIAIM as the most appropriate instrument to implement its
long-term policy for irrigated agriculture. All the triggers for moving from phase 1 to 2
were determined to have been achieved satisfactorily 6.
20.      All priority studies for preparing investments in phase 2 had been completed
during phase 1 7 and additional measures to address implementation problems/issues
identified during the implementation of phase 1 were taken. These included: bringing
together engineering firms and contractors to determine better ways to complete
irrigation infrastructures on time and at a reasonable cost, arrangements to ensure better
accountability and coordination of core agencies involved in irrigation development, and
administrative improvements for ensuring timely availability of investment matching
grants and timely land registration for beneficiaries. Moreover, drawing on the lessons
learned from the implementation of phase 1, some slight modifications were introduced
in the design of the program. As a result, the duration of the Program was changed to a 3-
phase 15-year program (from 11-year) with a targeted irrigation scheme development of
12,500 ha (from 13,000 ha) and the main components were consolidated reducing their
number from seven to four. The preparation team also gave careful attention to the design
of the credit component by having it reviewed by a Financial Sector Specialist and
making all the necessary revisions.
21.    The overall Program objective as well as the implementation arrangement
remained the same.
22.     PDIAIM’s approach to comprehensively address all issues facing irrigation
development was a bold undertaking. The Program attempted to solve a large and diverse
set of problems in the irrigation subsector. Thus, just like phase 1, PDIAIM II’s design


6
  The triggers for moving from Phase I to Phase II had been defined as follows: (i) Liberalization measures
for agricultural markets and transport services, as agreed upon between the Government and IDA in the
1999-2002 PFP, remain in place; (ii) UNCACEM has achieved operational and financial self-sufficiency
by 2001; (iii) Credit and investment subsidies granted in accordance with procedures agreed upon with
IDA; (iv) Awards of land use permits, temporary and permanent concessions are in conformity with land
tenure regulations; (v) Establishment of transparent and accessible land registries allowing verification of
permits and temporary or permanent concessions; (vi) Procedures are established for the collection of water
fees and operation and management charges for public infrastructure works; (vii) Economic return on
Government-supported irrigation infrastructure demonstrated satisfactorily; and (viii) Performance of
SONADER judged satisfactory according to criteria set out in the performance contract.

focused on developing collective small to medium irrigation schemes (versus large-scale)
but also rehabilitating the existing (but degraded) individual and village schemes;
facilitating access to credit for maintenance, repairs, rehabilitation of the schemes (as the
degradation of the latter were mainly due to lack of credit); formalizing producers
organizations (poor farmers’ organization or lack of recognition of such organization was
another reason for degradation of the schemes); proving the profitability and competitive
advantage of producing rice locally; sustainable operation and maintenance of collective
infrastructure; and diversification.
23.    Nevertheless, there were also some gaps that in retrospect should have received
more attention during project preparation, including:
 (i)    Cost/benefit analysis: an “illustrative” analysis was carried out. Since this was
        the second phase of the project, the preparation team should have analyzed the
        activities of phase 1 in ex-post fashion. The failure to do it eventually led to the
        wrong assumption that the economics were favorable and farmers would be able
        to repay the loans.
(ii)    Re-examination of the Program’s basic assumptions: though efforts were
        made to address the issues identified during the implementation of phase 1, phase
        2 preparation process did not use the opportunity to systematically attempt to
        reexamine and validate all aspects of the overall Program and its 1st phase, vis-à-
        vis the basic assumptions on which it was built. In this context, a number of
        critical questions were not sufficiently explored, namely: (a) why do selected
        perimeters need rehabilitation in the first place given that many of them had been
        abandoned and rehabilitated before; would there be no alternative measures to
        increase yields and incomes that could be undertaken first?; (b) can an agricultural
        bank succeed in a high risk environment characterized by natural phenomena with
        droughts and flooding alternating and with clients that are close to the subsistence
        level and do not have a solid credit repayment culture? (though during phase 1 it
        assumed self-sufficiency, UNCACEM’s viability was already tested once with the
        1999 floods, that forced it to reschedule the debts over the next years); (c) does
        the irrigation agency have the necessary means in terms of staff, operational
        means and technical competence to ensure that irrigation rehabilitation is done
        according to acceptable standards (selection and technical design of these
        perimeters, selection of the right kind of pumping equipment, and assurance that
        the unit investment costs do not exceed certain thresholds)?; and (d) do farmers
        have the necessary technical and management capacity to play the role in the
        procurement process that was devolved to them?
(iii)   Design. Implementation difficulties and delays were already experienced during
        the implementation of phase 1. And although the project design for phase 2 was
        innovative, too little effort was paid to reduce the complexity of it, despite the fact
        that PDIAIM’s complexity was already raised during Quality at Entry Assessment
        of phase 1 and at the ICR stage. Some efforts were made to introduce some
        changes but these were minor with only marginal impact on the complexity of the
        program.

24.     The PAD identified two types of risks, including: (i) risks to PDO 8, and (ii) risks
to component results 9. With respect to the PDO, five risks were identified of which two
risks (high road transport and sea freight costs) were rated as substantial and one (lack of
enforcement of credit default regulations) as moderate. All risks identified as Risks to
Components results were rated as Moderate, except for one (lack of information about
PDIAIM) was rated as negligible. Political risk was not considered, though the country
had already suffered political unrest in August 2005 (shortly after appraisal).
25.     Some of the proposed risk mitigation measures (transport costs for road and sea
freight) went beyond what could be influenced by the project. For others concerning
SONADER and UNCACEM, the performance based contracts between these institutions
and the PCU were supposed to provide early warning signals. However, the PCU did not
have the necessary manpower and technical capacity to supervise and enforce these
performance based contracts. With respect to the political risk, the entire phase 2 project
implementation period (2005-2012) was characterized by frequent political instability
which impacted negatively the course of the project implementation. During this time, the
country experienced two military coups. At the onset of the coup of August 2005, there
was a 19 months transition period with reduced project activities. Then the political
unrest of 2008 not only resulted in suspension of project activities for more than a year,
but also, with the arrival of a new Government there were changes in policy and priorities
which negatively impacted some of the project’s activities (especially those related to
agricultural credit and rehabilitation of irrigation perimeters).
26.     A Quality at Entry Assessment was done in September 2005 10, which gave the
project a Satisfactory rating.
Additional Financing
27.     The formulation of the AF was done on the basis of the drought recovery plan
developed by DRM and the Government’s EMEL Program (refer paragraph 6 and 7
above). The project (though in the last period of implementation with closing date of
September 2012) was selected as the operation to channel the additional resources as it
not only was already active in several regions of southern Mauritania but also it offered
adequate institutional and fiduciary capacities and the most convenient opportunity to
fast-track the Bank’s emergency response in drought affected areas.


8
  The risks to PDO considered were: (i) the incentive structure reverts back to favor rice at the expense of
agricultural diversification: (ii) unabated, large-scale fraudulent rice imports destabilize the domestic rice
sector, (iii) road transport costs remain high, (iv) sea freight costs remain high; and (iv) inadequate
enforcement of credit default regulations forces high cost upon UNCACEM.
9
  The risks to achieving component results were: (i) the pace of land registration is slow, resulting in delays
in the credit approval process and implementation of rehabilitation; (ii) SONADER’s technical oversight of
rehabilitation is inadequate, leading to slow implementation of rehabilitation; (iii) the procedures for the
collection of water and O&M charges are not implemented further degrading primary irrigation
infrastructure; (iv) SONADER fails to deliver adequate agricultural services to smallholders; and (v)
UNCACEM yields to outside interference, accepting bad loans and jeopardizing its financial self-
sufficiency

Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA7)

28.    It should be noted here that preparation of the AF was cumbersome due to
frequent shift of the Government’s position. The Bank received two requests, the first one
in October 2011 (including support for irrigation), which led to an initial preparation
mission in November/December 2011 and the second reformulated/different request
(without support for irrigation) in January 2012. This not only delayed timely project
preparation and effectiveness, but also increased transaction costs of Bank engagement.
29.      The main limitations of the AF were as follows: (i) the ambitious targets in terms
of timing and quantitative targets. The increased volume of inputs (quantities of urea to
be distributed and the number of animals to be vaccinated) planned to be distributed/used
within two years were way above the absorption capacity of the intended project
beneficiaries; (ii) the implementation mechanism, though existing and used in the past by
the Mauritanian authorities, was not designed to handle such a large increase in volume
of fertilizer to be distributed and number of animals to be vaccinated; and (iii) because of
the start-up delays, the planned activities including the delivery of the inputs could not
reach the beneficiaries on time: for example, cereal distribution did not start before July
2013, even though the actual critical situation for beneficiary population occurred during
2012 (see Annex 11 Independent Evaluation of the SAVS).
30.     The Operational Risk Assessment Framework (ORAF) in the Emergency Project
Paper listed a number of highly relevant risks along with the mitigation measures, and
rated all the risks Low to Moderate. However the proposed mitigation measures for the
poor contract management—the new procurement code adopted by the Government,
which encourages hiring independent staff for procurement commissions at central level,
the putting in place of a new Procurement Regulation Authority, and the Public Sector
Capacity Building Project addressing the issues arising out of the CFAA action plan, —
turned out to be insufficient; the new procurement code did not operate as smoothly as
anticipated by the Public Sector Capacity Building Project. As a result the Government
ended up self-financing/implementing the activities related to the distribution of the
agriculture inputs, and vaccines and veterinary products.
2.2 Implementation
The Project implementation and outcomes were impacted by the following key factors:
 (i)   Slow project start-up: Despite being the 2nd phase of an APL, the project started
       out slowly, first due to the above mentioned political instability right at the
       beginning of phase 2 but also due to failure by the Government to approve the
       land rights (concessions) on time and provide the necessary support to the bureau
       of land affairs.
(ii)   Non-compliance with the Irrigation Policy Letter (Lettre de Politique de
       Développements de l’Agriculture Irriguée- LPDAI). Contrary to the requirement
       of the irrigation policy, some irrigation development projects (PRBP, PGIRE,
       national program, and projects financed by other donors) financed 100 percent of
       the costs of irrigation rehabilitation/expansion without any contribution by the
       beneficiaries. The situation was further complicated as some of the targeted
       farmers were beneficiaries of both PDIAIM and one of these other projects.




                                             9
(iii)   Natural disasters. The implementation of the project was impacted by a series of
        floods. For instance the August 2008 flooding not only affected the physical
        irrigation structures but also resulted in loss of crops. As a result there was a need
        to distribute the necessary agricultural inputs to the affected population. The other
        natural incident was bird attacks that resulted in not only substantial decrease in
        yield but also had impact on the agricultural product quality making them unfit
        for consumption or trade.
(iv)    The Global Food Price Crisis. Apart from the flooding, Mauritania was hit hard
        by the 2008 Global Food Price Crisis; it was especially severe for its rice sector.
        Thus as an attempt to stimulate agricultural production, the Government declared
        2008 as the “Year of Agriculture”. And as a matter of government policy, it
        instructed the National Union of Agricultural and Savings and Credit
        Cooperatives (UNCACEM) to more than double its lending volume for irrigated
        agriculture and to increase the amount of seasonal loans that farmers could obtain
        per hectare from UM60,000 to 150,000. To do this, UNCACEM had to borrow
        money from the banking system at relatively high interest rates (12 percent)
        versus the IDA line of credit (4.5%). This decision affected UNCACEM’s
        financial viability as its loan portfolio deteriorated rapidly and the amounts of
        unpaid loans reached 60 percent. UNCACEM in fact never recovered from this
        intervention by the Government. During 2010/2011, UNCACEM did not lend at
        all and eventually by 2012/2013 it went bankrupt.
 (v)    Increase in the rehabilitation costs: During phase 1, the average rehabilitation
        costs were 608,000 UM/ha. However, during the second phase, these unit costs
        for various reasons increased significantly and reached 2 million UM/ha, i.e. three
        times the amount of phase 1 (see details in Annex 3). These cost increases meant
        that the amounts allocated by the project for rehabilitation were fully used up
        even though less than 40 percent of the original physical objective was achieved.
(vi)    Mid-term Review. The MTR carried out from April 14 to 24, 2008 determined
        that the PDO still remained highly relevant, in light of the food price crises facing
        Mauritania (especially impacting the rice sector), but also positive results of the
        beneficiaries satisfaction analysis and a total disbursement rate of about 60
        percent. At the same time the support mission also noted major challenges for the
        project including: (i) non-compliance with the irrigation policy letter; (ii) slow
        progress with regard to land tenure regularization; (iii) unwillingness of private
        owners with irrigated areas of less than 40 ha to participate in the project; (iv)
        delays with regard to the diversification component; and (v) too little attention
        being paid to environmental safeguard aspects. The MTR mission also observed
        that the two key project implementing institutions, namely UNCACEM and
        SONADER, showed signs of important weaknesses.
        Nevertheless, although the MTR made a number of very pertinent and crucial
        recommendations (strict application of the irrigation policy letter; analysis of why
        private irrigation farmers with less than 40ha did not participate; restart of
        diversification activities with emphasis on the local market; need for greater
        attention to environmental safeguard issues; acceleration of land titling; and full
        recuperation of operation and maintenance expenditures to ensure sustainability


                                             10
            of perimeters that were rehabilitated), they were not acted upon neither by the
            PCU nor followed up by subsequent supervision missions. This could partly be
            attributed to the political unrest that started soon after the MTR, and during which
            all project activities were suspended.
(vii)       Political unrests. The implementation period of PDIAIM II was also marked by
            especially difficult political circumstances that negatively affected project
            execution and Bank supervision. As stated earlier there were two military coups:
            on August 3, 2005 shortly after appraisal and on August 6, 2008, immediately
            following the MTR. The latter resulted in a political unrest and upheaval for more
            than a year. The project was in limbo and little progress was achieved following
            the Bank’s suspension of disbursements to Mauritania under OP/BP 7.30 11 (from
            August 2008 to November 2009, or about 15 months). Only after a new
            Government was elected in July 2009 did political stability return and
            consequently the Bank also resumed its operation.
            Following the election of July 2009, a reengagement mission was carried out by
            the Bank (from December 13 to 30, 2009). The main results of this mission were
            again a good analysis of all the existing problems (counterpart funding,
            UNCACEM’s financial difficulty, the delays in land titling, and weak capacities
            of the implementing institutions) and a series of pertinent recommendations.
            However, since the Government was new no immediate action could be
            undertaken. In addition, at the time of the mission the project was at a
            disbursement level of 75 percent leaving little room for major restructuring of the
            project.
(viii)      Change in Policy and Commitment. With the arrival of the new Government in
            2009, the commitment to the Project that existed earlier disappeared. Instead, the
            new Government took many measures that negatively impacted implementation
            of the project. These included the repetitive interventions in the operations of
            UNCACEM, the suspension of the land titling activities, the non-respect of the
            LPDAI, among other things.
 (ix)       The Additional Financing. The implementation of the AF experienced delays
            not only during preparation (see paragraph 28) but also during implementation
            due to non-performance by selected contractor and procedural complaints related
            to the purchase of fertilizers and veterinary products. Given the urgency of the
            matter, the Government decided to use its own fertilizer stock and undertook
            vaccination activities with its own funds. Thus the planned project activities for
            fertilizer distribution and livestock vaccination were no-longer to be financed by
            IDA and GFRP funds. In view of this, the Government requested the Bank (in its
            letter of May 9, 2013) to partially cancel and re-direct the un-used IDA resources
            for a future agricultural operation.
  (x)       Independent Review of PDIAIM. Towards the end of the closing date of the AF,
            an independent review of the food security aspects of the AF was carried out from

        September 20 – October 10, 2013 12. Around the same period, the Government
        requested an independent review of the whole PDIAIM experience, covering
        Phase I and II from 1999 until 2012, in order to prepare for the ICR and to draw
        important lessons for future operations in the Sahel. This review took place from
        January 18-Februry 6, 2014 and was conducted by a 5-member team of
        international and national consultants 13.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
Original Project
31.     Design of the M&E system. According to the PAD, the M&E network
comprised a main M&E system housed in the project unit, sharing and communicating—
through common platforms (Access, GIS, other files)—information with key
implementing agencies and partners. However, given the low capacity on the ground the
design of the system was relatively difficult to implement. When evaluating the
indicators used for phase 2’s results framework, the formulation of some of the outcome
and results indicators was too broad in that they could not easily be measured and
verified (for example some indicators included “Yes” or “No” as measurable targets).
Also the lack of results indicators is particularly noticeable concerning: (i) the unit costs
of rehabilitation (a critical figure that impacts capacity of borrowers to repay their short-
and long-term loans); (ii) the quality and performance of perimeters once rehabilitated
(this can vary considerably); (iii) the number of private farmers engaging in rehabilitation
and area rehabilitated since they were supposed to rehabilitate some 1,000 ha; (iv) the
volume and value of fruits and vegetables produced for the local and export market (not
just number of fruits and vegetable producers); and (v) the performances of UNCACEM
that would enable to assess it financial soundness (this was also recommended by the
panel of the Quality at Entry Assessment) and SONADER (especially indicators that
would enable to assess the performance contract between SONADER and the PCU).
32.     Utilization of the M&E system. The consecutive implementation support
missions did not conduct a specific evaluation of the M&E system. The MTR mission
noted that the M&E system produced important project related information. Support
missions among other pointed out the insufficient knowledge by the Project staff of the
M&E system and the GIS and the lack of motivation of SONADER’s M&E staff as
limitations for the full utilization of the system. Following the MTR, the mission
proposed revisions to the results framework by adding indicators on percentage of
operation and maintenance recovery in the big irrigation perimeters, yield increases and
cropping intensity, quantities processed and percentage of utilization of infrastructure

   « Note d’Evaluation des Filets de Sécurité Alimentaire du Programme Emel (Boutiques Emel et Stocks
Alimentaires Villageois de Sécurité (SAVS) ». This evaluation was carried out between September 26 and
October 10, 2013 by two consultants: Messrs. Joel Hourticq and Limam Abdawa.

economist and mission leader), Abdoulaye Dicko (international consultant in irrigation/civil engineering),
Mohameden Baba (national consultant in irrigation/civil engineering), Mohamed Didi (national agricultural
credit specialist), and Isakha Diagana (national specialist in land tenure questions).

(cold storage). Though these indicators were very pertinent they were not included in any
of the restructurings and thus were never formally reported on.
33.     Another critical limitation of the system was the fact that the hard copies of
project records were not kept systematically and with the departure of the M&E specialist
in 2013, the electronic records disappeared revealing the fact how much the operation of
the M&E system depended on a single individual.
Additional Financing
34.      Design of the M&E system. The design of the monitoring system and choice of
monitoring indicators was straightforward and followed directly from the PDO of the AF.
The monitoring system did not emphasize impact evaluation, as this was an emergency
operation that did not aim at establishing sustainable outcomes over the medium- and
long-term. One important limitation was the fact that not enough attention was given to
carefully analyze to what extent the existing monitoring setup would be able to collect
these data from the project regions. This would have been especially important, since the
AF covered 10 administrative Regions of the country whereas PDIAIM II intervened in
only four of them. Also, the target values established by the Government for the different
project sub-components were not critically examined to see to what extent they were
realistic. Lastly, the activities of the AF being related to an emergency operation, no
baseline study was undertaken because of time constraint and all indicators were
therefore referring to “additional support…”. However, this concept of “additionality’
was not clearly understood by the Government; it had trouble differentiating between the
various sources of funding for the same activity (this was also reported in the ISRs).
35.    Utilization of the M&E system. The AF was also affected by the departure of
the M&E Specialist. Though he was replaced by a new specialist in August 2013, the
problem could only be partially alleviated as the new M&E Specialist was among others
not familiar with Bank M&E requirements, especially concerning gender aspects. The
implementation support mission of January/February 2014 noted that: (i) data storage and
management was deficient; (ii) too little attention had been given to establishing baseline
and target data; and (iii) the Livestock Department had difficulties in providing data on
the number of beneficiaries, especially disaggregated by gender.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
36.     Safeguards. Just like phase 1, phase 2 was a Category A project, and triggered
the same seven safeguard policies, namely: a) environmental assessment, b) natural
habitats, c) pest management, d) cultural property, e) involuntary resettlement, f) safety
of dams, and g) projects on international waterways. To comply with these policies, a
number of documents were prepared and diffused such as the environmental and social
action plan, a resettlement plan, a plan for the safety of the Foum Gleita Dam 14, a pest
management plan, and the OMVS was notified concerning the project. Also, certain
actions were taken, including: a) a study concerning the management of the lake Gouere,
b) the strengthening of mechanical bird control measures instead of chemical ones, c) the

   The Government has requested the new National Sugar Company to fund and implement the study done
for the Foum Gleita Dam.


                                                13
improvement of the sanitary conditions for the population along the river by digging of
wells for potable water, and d) inclusion of environmental and social aspects in the
feasibility studies for rehabilitation of irrigation perimeters. No resettlement took place.
37.     However, several implementation support missions noted that safeguard measures
did not receive the attention they deserved; SONADER did not have the institutional
capacity to systematically deal with these issues and the Ministry of the Environment was
not sufficiently involved. The Bank’s safeguard mission of November 2011 reported that
not only the safeguard specialist at the PCU was assigned to other non-safeguard related
duties, but also no supervision with respect to safeguard conformity of the civil works
was undertaken 15 on a regular basis.
38.    When the AF operation became effective, all activities of the original project were
completed. And given the type of activities under the AF, the latter was classified as a
Category B (partial assessment) project and the only safeguard policies triggered were
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) and Pest Management (OP 4.09). A new
Safeguard Specialist for the PIU was hired as a condition of Project effectiveness. The
ESMP and PMP were updated to cover the environmental (inappropriate use and
handling of fertilizers and pesticides) and social impacts that could result from the
implementation of the new component. These documents were published and adherence
to the safeguard policies was followed up by the Safeguard Specialist. The
implementation support missions did not report any problems.
39.     Financial Management and Audit. PDIAIM II as well as the AF were
implemented by entities already established and used under PDIAIM I, i.e. SONADER,
UNCACEM and a Project Coordination Unit (PCU). SONADER and UNCACEM were
in charge of all aspects of financial management of the project with additional
consolidating responsibility played by the PCU. Thus, PDIAIM II and the AF benefitted
from the previous financial management (FM) capabilities in terms of managing IDA
funds. Project accounts were regularly kept and withdrawal applications were prepared
directly from the project’s accounting software. Specialists, who participated in the
implementation support missions, rated the internal financial control mechanisms as
moderately satisfactory throughout project implementation.
40.      Financial statements for the PDIAIM II as well as the AF were audited and
certified without qualifications, albeit sometimes with delays in the case of PDIAIM II.
Until early 2008, financial management was rated as Satisfactory. It then became
Moderately Satisfactory (MS) and stayed at MS until the end of the AF. The reasons for
this rating downgrade were mainly weaknesses in budget control and unauthorized rent
payments for project offices.
41.     There was also and INT investigation in October 2012. This was based on the
allegations of fraud by various project officials during the implementation of six IDA-
financed projects in Mauritania, including the PDIAIM. Specifically for PDIAIM, the
allegation was for overpayment of perdiems and mishandling of management trainings.

The outcome of the INT investigation was that since national laws may have been
violated it referred the investigative findings to the Government so that it could conduct
its own independent investigations to determine if any of its domestic laws were violated
and take necessary measures accordingly.
42.     Procurement. Both under PDIAIM II and the AF, most procurement was carried
out by the PCU based on procurement plans that were updated in a timely manner.
Procurement under PDIAIM II and the AF was judged as satisfactory from project start
until July 20, 2012. Then the rating changed to moderately satisfactory (due to the delays)
and was upgraded back to satisfactory during the last support mission of the AF in
February 2014.
43.      For PDIAIM II the execution of contracts for the rehabilitation of several
irrigation perimeters posed problems as there were disagreements between the
beneficiaries and construction companies over the quality of the works; whether the latter
should be accepted as satisfactory and the final payment should be made.
44.     Under the AF, procurement problems arose as it became apparent that procedures
for the procurement of food and fertilizers/vaccines in an emergency situation were not
compatible with IDA procurement rules and regulations. A deficient fertilizer supplier
was selected and his contract had to be canceled. Also, procurement of veterinary
products took so long that it had to be dropped and self-financed by the Government.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
45.      Until the very end of PDIAIM II, the task team operated under the assumption
that in line with the long-term focus of the agreed APL financing instrument for the
program there would be either PDIAIM III or a different follow-up irrigation project.
Various supervision missions reminded the Government of the necessity to update the
Irrigation Policy Letter that expired at the end of 2011 and to prepare a review of the
triggers established for passing to a third phase. However, it appeared later on that the
Government had no interest in the continuation of PDIAIM. The Minister of Rural
Development signaled repeatedly that his department wanted to rethink its approach to
irrigation development and rehabilitation and the future of agricultural credit and of
UNCACEM. He indicated that the focus should not be on rehabilitating existing
perimeters but to develop new large public irrigation perimeters to be used for the
resettlement of the Diplômés Chômeurs (unemployed university graduates) and those
herders from the North that had lost their livelihood due to drought. When preparation of
the AF started, the original intention of the Government was to include a sub-component
on irrigation that would have enabled completing PDIAIM’s irrigation rehabilitation
activities. However, this sub-component was removed following a reversal by the
Government of its position on rehabilitation works. Subsequently, it was decided that
irrigation development along the Senegal River Valley should be pursued through the
second phase of the Integrated Water Resource Management in the Senegal River Valley
Project (a regional project with OMVS).
46.      The AF operation did not aim at establishing any sustainable medium- to long-
term outcomes and there is no follow-up operation planned related to the emergency
activities. However, there were provisions in the budget of the AF to finance studies for
the preparation of future agricultural investments with a view to continue developing the


                                            15
long-term agricultural supply side response to the recurring food shortages in Mauritania.
These studies are available and notably contributed to the preparation of the OMVS water
development project referred above.
3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Original Project
Rating: Modest
47.     The long-term development objective of the PDIAIM APL was to increase the
value-added of irrigated agriculture and related incomes and employment in the Senegal
River Valley through the judicious use of the country’s most precious natural asset: water
and arable land. It reflected both the Government’s priority for the irrigation subsector
and Bank’s priority for the Agricultural Sector of Mauritania. The Government designed
a Rural Development Strategy (2001), prepared and shared Letter of Development Policy
for Irrigated Agriculture (1999), and developed its Agro-Food Strategy (2001). These
documents were characterized as the cornerstones of the PRSP’s second pillar-- to reflect
a long-term shared vision of turning the Senegal River Valley into one of the main
sources of development and economic growth. For the Bank, it was a continuation of the
first phase of the APL and showed the “Bank’s willingness to support the country’s long-
term commitment to fight poverty, predicated, among others, on the efficient and
sustainable use of the country’s most valuable renewable natural resource: irrigated land.”
And even today the objective remains highly relevant, especially in view of the likely
effects of climate change and the need to improve the resilience of agriculture production
systems in which irrigation undoubtedly has a large role to play.
48.     With regards to the project design, it showed a number of positive elements: (i) it
reflected lessons learned from Phase I and made a number of adjustments; (ii) it
identified the importance of cost-sharing by beneficiaries, which is a best practice across
World Bank and other donor projects in the irrigation sector; (iii) it identified the right
safeguards policies and prepared the necessary mitigation measures; (iv) it included
M&E as a sub-component; and (v) it combined investment in irrigation infrastructure
with capacity improvement and incentive mechanism. In addition, the components of the
project were very well aligned with the PDO.
49.     However, the design also demonstrated a number of limitations. As stated earlier,
PDIAIM’s attempted to address a large and diverse set of issues related to the irrigation
sector. Thus the design and the implementation modalities, a reflection of this holistic
approach, were complex. This, however, did not match the reality on the ground: the
project was demanding to implement because of the complexity of the integrated
approach (which required skillful collaboration, coordination across multiple agencies,
monitoring, etc.), the scope of activities, the geographical area covered, and all these with
limited capacity of the implementation institutions (PCU, UNCACEM, SONADER, etc.).
50.    Where the project really failed was in project implementation. It is true that the
project had some achievements; it contributed to the improvement of the local rice
production (which has become competitive both in price and quality compared to
imported rice); it also helped in the establishment of producers’ organizations with legal


                                             16
recognition; through its capacity building activities it benefitted POs (including women
farmers), employees of the implementation entities, and other entities involved in project
implementation. Despite these the project was also unsuccessful in many aspects: the set
targets for rehabilitation was only achieved by 34 percent, the quality of the rehabilitation
were low, UNCACEM was in financial difficulty, and the project was never able to
attract the small private irrigation farmers (less than 40ha).
51.     Several attempts were made to improve project performance including continuous
dialog with counterpart and modification to the approaches (for example review of the
level of rehabilitation by including the financing of tertiary irrigation channels and land
leveling, not in the initial plan). At the same time the implementation of phase 2 was
marked by difficult circumstances (political and natural) that negatively affected project
execution. However, the project’s complex design and ambitious targets were never
revised despite the difficulties faced and the unlikeliness of achieving agreed targets.
52.     Therefore, on the basis of rating the relevance of the PDO as high, the relevance
of the design as modest, and that of implementation as negligible, the overall relevance
for the original project is rated as Modest.
Additional Financing
Rating: Substantial
53.    The relevance of the AF objective is high, as the AF sought to address a specific
emergency (response to the Global Food Price Crisis that also hit Mauritania) and as such
were highly relevant. The PDO was to improve availability of critical agricultural input
and food staples for targeted beneficiaries which corresponded to the needs and
challenges at hand. And clearly the PDO continues to remain relevant in similar
emergency situations.
54.     The design was very simple that focused on providing food distribution and
agricultural inputs to reduce the impact of the flood and food price crisis. The fact of
using PDIAIM II as the vehicle for implementation of the AF because it has established
the necessary administrative and fiduciary capacity in the form of the PCU of PDIAIM
was clearly advantageous. However, the targets were too ambitious in relation to the
absorption capacity of the beneficiaries as well as the limited capacity of the
implementation institutions.
55.      During implementation, there were procurement issues that delayed project
activities, and thus the Government had to eventually resort to self-financing of the
distribution of the agriculture inputs and livestock vaccination. Finally because of the
startup delays, the delivery of the inputs could only be done one year later, thus way after
the actual critical situation of the emergency.
56.    Therefore, given the relevance for the PDIAIM II is rated as Modest and the AF
as Substantial, the overall relevance of the project is rated as Modest.

 57.     PDO. The PDO of PDIAIM II was three-fold: (i) consolidate key incentive
 measures (land tenure and rural credit), (ii) increase sustainable irrigation schemes, and
 (iii) intensify agricultural diversification for targeted actors engaged in irrigated
 agriculture. To measure the PDO outcome, the PAD identified four key outcome
 indicators. The indicators, targets and actual status are summarized in table 2 below:

 58.   Based on the assessments of the above targets the project achievement of the
 PDOs is rated as Negligible and details are given below.
 59.      Land tenure. The Project fell short of achieving its target. Delays in land titling
 had already started to be seen in phase 1, but things got worse during phase 2. The first
 reason was the lack of the institutional capacity of the implementing institution. The
 institution responsible for this activity, Service des Affaires Foncières et de la
 Cartographie (SAFC), no longer had the adequate means. SAFC did receive PDIAIM
 financing but it was not enough. SAFC did not have the adequate staffing, could no
 longer organize support missions as well as manage its day to day operations. The second
 reason for the delay was caused by the delays in the signatures of the decrees both at the
 level of the Ministry of Finance and Council of Ministers. Thus during phase 2, only
 about 200 additional titles could be regularized bringing the total number to about 1,000.
 And out of the three targeted regions, this was mainly done in the Trarza region, where
 the Schema de Structure existed already. For the other three, only the perimeters of the
 POs’ could be regularized (thus individual farmers did not benefit). In many cases there
 were also ambiguities between final concessions and property titles. This was the case
 particularly for women, for which the concession titles were merely used to benefit from
 the project rather than as proof of land ownership. A third reason was the dual
 management of land tenure issues between the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of
 Rural Development (hosting the SAFC), and the inability of the project to conduct the
 required Schema de structure for the upper Valley which was needed to regularize land
 titles in this part of the Valley. Finally, only one land registration office was functional at
 the end of the Project.
 60.     Rural credit. The Project’s objective with respect to rural credit was not achieved
 due to financial difficulties of UNCACEM and its inability to provide credits. This
 resulted mainly from the repetitive interventions in the institution’s operations by the
 Government. UNCACEM was performing according to expectations and was self-
 sufficient until 2008 (the MTR reported that UNCACEM has reached a financial self-


                                               18
sufficiency rate of 193 percent in 2007). This situation changed drastically with the 2008
flooding of the Senegal River Valley region, followed by the Global Food Price Crisis
that badly hit Mauritania. At the time, the Government obliged the institution to
drastically increase its lending volume (loans per hectare); UNCACEM could only meet
this increased funding requirement by reverting to commercial banks that charged a very
high interest rate. This combined with many producers defaulting in repayment of their
loans, worsened the institutions financial viability. In December 2009, a decision by the
Prime Minister to instruct UNCACEM to abandon all interest charges on its agricultural
loans and forgive a large percentage of the principal outstanding impaired the quasi
totality of UNCACEM’s loan portfolio.
61.      During 2010, UNCACEM made no loans for agriculture and in 2011 it was only
able to lend to agriculture because it received the funds needed from the Government.
UNCACEM ceased to be an independent financial institution; rather it became a fund
receiving money from the Government which it distributed to farmers according to
instructions it received. Since then UNCACEM never recovered from its financial
difficulties, and was eventually replaced by the newly established Agricultural Credit
institution, Caisse de Dépôt et de Développement.
62.      Rehabilitation of irrigation schemes. The Project was only able to partially
achieve this target. This could be attributed to natural disasters (mainly flooding), delay
in land titling, very high rehabilitation costs (according to the PDIAIM’s independent
evaluation, the average unit cost was three times more than what was estimated initially)
that resulted in rapid exhaustion of the resources planned for this activity, non-respect of
the LPAD, unattractive financing and implementation mechanism for the private
producers, and the complex project implementation arrangement and low capacity of the
implementation institutions. The high rehabilitation cost resulted from: changes in the
level of rehabilitation (originally, it was planned to finance the principal and secondary
irrigation channels only but not the tertiary irrigation channels and land leveling. Later on,
this was changed); inclusion of funding for protective dams; price inflation; geographic
dispersion of rehabilitation sites; difficult physical access (no roads) to some
rehabilitation sites; and difficult morphology of the sites in the Haut-Fleuve. As a
consequence of all the above, only 34 percent of the targeted area could be rehabilitated
under phase 2 and this was only the perimeters managed by POs (no individual farmer
benefitted).
63.     However, it should be noted here that all the planned studies were completed. The
capacity building activities for the POs were carried through, though in depth assessment
of their capacity to take over the management of the public infrastructure was not done.
64.      Diversification. The project was able to demonstrate the potential of some
agriculture practices or opportunities but it could not address the constraints related to
sustainability. Consequently most of the important innovations introduced by the Project
(e.g. drip irrigation) were abandoned at the end of the project mainly due to lack of
capacity and lack of technical assistance, insufficient organization of the operators,
(inability to use the cold-storage facilities), or unavailability of parts (for example for drip
irrigation). Value chain studies (for example Onion) were carried out but there has been
no follow up. No credit was made available for diversification. In terms of rehabilitation



                                              19
the project focused mainly of the support to the producers already engaged in
diversification activities.
65.     Triggers. Of the five triggers for moving from PDIAIM Phase II to Phase III two
were partially achieved namely: (i) the charter of procedures for water and O&M charges
of public infrastructure is implemented by SONADER and producers’ organizations –
though the degree of adherence varies from perimeter to perimeter; and (ii) awards of
irrigated land concessions are in accordance with land tenure legislation and the land use
categories (schemas de structure) – though only the land registration bureau in Rosso
functions and the land use planning for the upper Senegal River Valley was not carried
out. The trigger “UNCACEM to reimburse the Government’s line of credit” was not
achieved, as UNCACEM went into financial difficulties, and the remaining two—rice
import tariffs are maintained or reduced throughout Phase II and measures promoting
competitive road transport services are fully implemented, as identified in the Bank-
financed Road Transport Sector Project were not reported on.
66.     It is on the basis of all the above that the achievement of the PDO of PDIAIM II
is rated as Negligible.
Additional Financing
Rating: Substantial
67.     The PDO for the AF was to improve availability of critical agricultural inputs and
food staples for targeted beneficiaries. Initially the project was to finance the acquisition
of 7,200 tons of wheat and their distribution to about 600 SAVS (approximately 150,000
beneficiaries, 40 percent of which women). However, the administrative authorities
decided to increase to 1,070 the number of SAVS in order to reach higher number of
beneficiaries. Then following the formal restructuring of August 2013, the operation was
to finance the purchase of additional 4,500 tons of cereals to be distributed to 450 SAVS.
68.      According to the final results of the AF, the operation was able to distribute the
anticipated 11,700 tons of wheat to the 1,520 SAVS as planned, and was able to reach
more than 305,000 beneficiaries (as shown in table 3 below this is 122 percent of the
initial target),
69.     However, a closer look at these results reveals two major limitations. First the
targeting of this operation was not fully respected; the decision of increasing the number
of SAVS for the 7,200 tons, resulted in a decrease to the actual quantity of cereals per
SAVS (from 12 tons/SAVS to about 7 tons/SAVS), creating a disconnect of the relative
amount of wheat made relative to emergency Community needs. Thus, the vast majority
of communities benefiting from the first 7,200 tons have seen this support as an
emergency relief operation (to be renewed if necessary) and not as the implementation of
a tool that can potentially lead to increase their resilience. Most of these SAVS have not
developed replenishment strategy to the next harvest, or, in many cases, did not
understand that the purpose of this instrument was the establishment of a village stock to
cushion prices to the benefit of the most vulnerable. The second limitation was that due to
some shortcomings (lengthy procedures for implementation) the 1st purchase of 7,200
tons did not begin distributions before July 2013, while it was in May-June-July-August
2012 that people were in the most critical situation.

70.       Though the Government self-financed the distribution of agriculture inputs
(fertilizer and vaccines) and livestock vaccination, the AF continued to monitor the
results of these activities. A review of the results shows a 37 percent achievement for
fertilizer and 78 percent achievement for livestock vaccination.

the overall rating for the achievement of the PDO is Modest.
3.3 Efficiency
Original Project
Rating: Negligible
72.      As stated earlier the project resources were depleted quickly mainly by the very
high rehabilitation cost. As a result the project could only achieve 34% of its target of
irrigation rehabilitation. Unlike the conclusion of the illustrative Cost Benefit Analysis
(CBA) for phase 2, which concluded that the ERR for the various investment models
would vary from 14% (rice only) to 22 percent (rice + diversification) and 23-62 percent
for diversification only, project execution developed very differently from what was
expected. On the positive side, from the farmers’ perspective, agricultural producers were
receiving higher prices for their produce following the rise in food prices that started in
2008. Nevertheless, unit costs were two to three times higher than originally expected. It
was believed that the higher cost would be offset by the higher prices farmers were
receiving and improvements in productivity. However, yields were on average only 4 t/ha
instead of 6 t/ha goal of the project, crop diversification was limited to very small areas
and over 95 percent of the irrigation areas were dedicated as in the past to sole cropping
of rice. Cropping intensity on perimeters rehabilitated under the project was 60 percent
instead of 150 percent expected. In most cases the POs were in serious financial
difficulties, unable to repay their debts. The Government decision to request UNCACEM
forgive these debts (in turn putting the institution in financial difficulty) was partly a
result of this situation.
73.     Using the counterfactual analysis that the project has not delivered on expected
results, taking into account that the economic justification (at least for rice) would have
required a productivity of at least 6 ton/ha (which the project has not achieved) and again
considering the poor achievement regarding crop intensification, it is clear that efficiency
should be rated as negligible.

74.     In the Project Paper of the AF, no economic or financial analysis was carried out
because of the emergency nature of activities. It was assumed that urea application on
rice and maintaining the sanitary status of the national herd as they were faced with
drought induced diseases would be a good investment. The independent ex-post analysis
presented in Annex 11 shows that the operation, although delayed by one year, was
efficiently carried out and that unit costs for food distribution and storage were
reasonable. However, the same repot also pointed out the one year delay in delivery of
the cereals; thus not really responding to the needs during the critical period.
Efficiency overall rating
75.   Given that efficiency of PDIAIM II is rated as Negligible and that of the AF as
Modest, the overall efficiency of the project is rated as Negligible.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Unsatisfactory
76.    On the basis of the above, with relevance rated as Modest, efficacy and efficiency
as Negligible, the overall outcome of the project is rated as Unsatisfactory.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
77.     PDIAIM II had a positive impact on the economic situation of women in the
rehabilitated irrigation perimeters. Extension agents of SONADER gave advice on
vegetable growing and women farmers responded with great enthusiasm. It is with the
contribution of the Project that vegetable growing by women has become much more
professional. Also, the gender reporting required by the Bank forced executing agencies
to start distinguishing in their reporting between female and male farmers. This is a
distinction which is uncommon in Mauritania and without prodding by the project would
not have happened. Over time, insistence on gender reporting by the Bank and other
donors can be expected to lead to a better understanding of this issue and of more
targeted interventions in favor of women farmers in the future.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
78.      The project had institutional strengthening as one of its objectives. Many
institutions, targeted as essential for improving the performance of irrigation agriculture
did benefit from PDIAIM’s capacity building activities. These included: SONADER, for
engineering advice and advice on agricultural production and the strengthening of
cooperatives; UNCACEM, for credit; CNRADA, for agricultural research and
development of new rice varieties and agronomic practices; CCQS (Centre de Contrôle
de Qualité des Semences) for seed control and certification; DPCSE, for the production of
reliable agricultural statistics; BAF/SAFC, for land registration and titling; and local
engineering firms. The Producer’s Organizations also were beneficiary.
79.     Nevertheless, for the various reasons explained in this report, this could not be
realized as expected or to the extent needed. Thus most of these institutions still are faced
with capacity constraints. This fact has become more evident recently, as some members
of the local donor community decided to finance an institutional review of the entire



                                             22
Ministry of Agriculture with all its agencies as a precondition for any further support to
the agricultural sector.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
N/A
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
80.     No beneficiary surveys and/or stakeholder workshops were carried out for
PDIAIM II and AF. However, comprehensive independent evaluations were carried out
for PDIAIM as a whole (phase I and II) and for the AF (see Annex 10 and Annex 11
respectively for the Executive Summaries of the evaluations) which also included field
visits. For instance for PDIAIM the consultants visited 22 out of the 33 project
rehabilitated perimeters in the four regions, and had interactions with several resource
persons including several representatives of the beneficiaries.
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Original Project
Rating: High
81.     Implementation of PDIAIM II was faced with too many challenges (ref earlier
paragraphs) that it was not able to achieve its planned targets and even for those
investments in rehabilitation of existing and development of new irrigation perimeter
already done ended up being not economically profitable. Therefore, the risk is that many
of the irrigation perimeters that were rehabilitated will deteriorate again and will need
further rehabilitations in the future. The unit investment costs were too high, benefits too
low and operation and maintenance expenditures (O&M) not adequately covered and
collected. The principle that beneficiaries should pay part of the investment costs through
long-term credit, although laudable, proved to be complicated as they were not
respected by all projects operating in the area (some of the projects in the area financed at
100 percent thus at zero cost for the beneficiary). None of the long-term credits have been
repaid aggravating UNCACEM’s financial situation. The Government’s decision on the
final faith of UNCACEM was long overdue; eventually the Government decided to
replace UNCACEM with a new credit institution. To reduce irrigation investment costs,
it would have been necessary to develop new technical low-cost approaches and to adopt
different construction norms. A more differentiated approach to small and large-scale
perimeters, public and private, would have been necessary. At the same time, the project
did not succeed to increase benefits per hectare to acceptable levels; paddy yields would
have had to be much higher than they are at present, and much more double cropping and
agricultural diversification would have had to take place to make the schemes sustainable.
Again this did not happen due to the many reasons cited earlier (high rehabilitation costs,
delay in land title regularization, low capacity of the implementation agencies, etc.).

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Original Project
Rating: Moderately satisfactory
83.     The Project preparation team has done its due diligence, as all studies required for
phase 2 were already completed during phase 1, lessons from phase 1 were taken into
account not only in the design, but also efforts were made to address issues that caused
delays during the implementation of phase 1 (including bringing together engineering
firms and contractors, arrangements for better coordination among core implementation
agencies, etc.). Again drawing on the lessons from phase 1, the team also gave careful
attention to the design of the credit component and closely worked with a financial sector
specialist to introduce the necessary revisions.
84.      However, there were also some limitations. The team did not analyze in sufficient
depth the deep seated and persistent challenges facing irrigated agriculture in Mauritania.
It considered that all the underlying assumptions that went into the formulation of the
Policy Letter for Irrigated Agriculture in Mauritania and the PDIAIM APL were still
valid and that Phase II would be a continuation of Phase I with little or no significant
changes. Being part of a larger program financed through a three-phased APL, there was
a notion that despite the ambitious targets and inherent complexities there was ample
time to deal with and resolve these issues. The financial analysis of farm budgets that
was used: a) to demonstrate the economic benefits of rehabilitation and b) to show that
farmers should be able to repay not only their short-term agricultural loans but also the
long-term investment loans was overoptimistic. It used yield figures and cropping
intensities that could theoretically be achieved but only if all the many interdependent
aspects of the project had been executed like a clock work. No meaningful sensitivity
analysis for risks was carried out that would have shown how vulnerable and uncertain
farmers’ repayment capacity was. The institutional capacity limitations of the two key
institutions: UNCACEM for credit and SONADER for advice on engineering as well as
agricultural extension advice were identified, but again no revisions were made to the
ambitious targets, that were less likely to be achieved given the level of performance of
these institutions. As stated earlier a Quality at Entry Assessment was done in September
2005 which gave the project a satisfactory quality-at-entry rating.

85.     The AF, since it was the response to a food emergency, was supposed to be put in
place in a very short time. It was developed based on the report by the Bank DRM team
and the Government’s EMEL plan. The design was simple and relevant to the then
prevailing emergency situation. One limitation of the AF was the ambitious targets; that
is some of the quantitative targets should have been examined in greater depth since they
turned out to be unrealistic in light of capacity limitations of implementing agencies.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Original Project
Rating: Unsatisfactory
86.     As noted before, prior to the floods in 2008 the Bank was aware of delays in
project implementation and downgraded both IP and DO. The supervision team focused
on addressing the underlying factors for the delays and accelerating implementation, with
some level of success 16. But events took over the Bank’s effort of making the project
more functional. Following the floods in 2008 and the Global Food Price Crisis, the
Government took a number of decisions, especially concerning UNCACEM, that planted
the seeds for derailing the project. Given that soon thereafter disbursements were
suspended under OP/BP 7.30 due to the political unrest, there was no on-going dialogue
or engagement between the Bank and the Government on these issue and project
implementation continued without restructuring.
87.     Following the reengagement, and with the new Government in place, supervision
efforts initially were focused to receive buy-in and ownership of the project by the new
government and guiding the new government to take necessary actions as recommended
in the aide-memoires. However, the Government did not come to a quick decision.
Furthermore, the Ministry of Rural Development was split into two.
88.      It is true that the occurrence of flood, food price crisis and the stalemate following
the political crisis was not conducive to push for significant restructuring. In hindsight,
however, the Bank team should have gone forward and start considering restructuring the
project once delays were apparent in project implementation. The team was candid in its
ratings of project progress initially but it did not show the same candor as project
implementation was progressing without substantive results; the project was rated as MS
in the ISR throughout its implementation period, except at the very end when it became
clear that a third phase was not forthcoming. The MTR should have been more forceful
and establish a clear timeline for the recommendations it made. To complicate matters,
the country office-based TTL of the project moved from Nouakchott to Kinshasa (DRC)
not long after the Bank’s reengagement following the political crisis; in the process close
follow up and consultation that would have been necessary for constructive engagement
to translate recommendations into actions was compromised. Moreover, bringing the new
Government on board took time and a good opportunity was missed waiting for the
Government to make its decision on its choice of instruments in support of irrigation
agriculture development. Finally, it should be noted that at the time of reengagement the
project had disbursed 75 percent of the credit proceeds. It is understood that in view of
this, the Bank might not have had a strong incentive to restructure the project as the scope
for corrective measures was perceived as too limited to turn around the overall
assessment of project performance.



16
  At the time of MTR the Bank team noticed that the project’s performance in delivering irrigation
rehabilitation works had considerably increased, with an overall duration between scheme identification
and completion of rehabilitation works reduced from 40 months at the beginning of Phase II to 20 months
only at MTR. Also at MTR time UNCACEM had reached a financial self-sufficiency rate of 193%.

89.     Overall, the AF was well supervised and necessary course corrections were done
expeditiously through restructuring. The fact that the AF was restructured several times
within two years is proof that project supervision was highly proactive and that the Bank
team did not hesitate to adjust project interventions and activities to evolving
circumstances. The Bank team was proactive and instrumental in extending project
closing date, identifying weakness and delivering training (e.g. in M&E), in dialoguing
with the Government and providing the necessary studies requested by the Government,
including independent evaluation of the project.

Rating: Unsatisfactory
90.     With respect to PDIAIM II, the Bank team has done its due diligence as most of
the preparatory work was completed (including required studies and taking into account
the lessons learned from phase 1). However, many shortcomings had been seen in the
supervision of the Project, particularly after the MTR; including lack of follow up of the
missions’ recommendations, failing to propose a substantial restructuring, inability to
take a stronger stance towards the inappropriate measures taken by the new Government
that negatively impacted the Project implementation. The AF was a satisfactory
undertaking that used existing infrastructure, selected areas where the Bank could make
quick contribution and partnered with the Commissariat for Food Security (CSA) which
in turn benefitted from WFP’s experience and support in distribution of food.
Supervision was timely carried and the necessary adjustments to the project were made
quickly.
91.    On balance, the overall performance of the Bank is rated Unsatisfactory.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Original Project
Rating: Unsatisfactory
92.     The first Government was fully behind the project and fully committed to the
required reforms in the sector, as expressed in the Policy Letter, though it failed to fully
implement the LPDAI, as it allowed some donors to provide financing on terms and
conditions that undermined the orientation of the project, especially the need for farmers
to co-finance that would have helped in developing ownership of the irrigation works. In
addition there had not been on-sight inspection of UNCACEM by the Central Bank
(BCM) since 2007. This constituted a regulatory/supervisory failure for which the
Government, the management of UNCACEM and the supervisory authority were
responsible.
93.     With the new Government taking office in 2009 the situation changed
significantly. PDAIM II was seen as a priority of the former government. Thus the new
Government was not necessarily in full support of the project. Consequently,


                                            26
commitments of the new Government, including its support to the Irrigation Policy Letter
waned over time. Also, the Government became increasingly interventionist in the affairs
of UNCACEM, did not stem the decline in SONADER’s capacity, reduced its support for
land titling, and started a policy of 100 percent subsidies. The government did not come
up with clear proposals to move the envisaged reform process forward, but rather in
response to problems on the ground appeared to be moving towards turning back the
clock on them. This was not an appealing platform for engagement for the Bank and
other donors, resulting in unilateral decisions by the Government. Lastly the Government
never came forward with a request to the Bank for restructuring the Project that could
have helped partially redress the situation.

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
94.      The Government acted decisively once it became clear that Part E 1 of the project
(fertilizer distribution and animal vaccine delivery) could not be implemented in time
respecting World Bank procurement rules and regulations. However the Government’s
unilateral decision to increase the number of SAVS to 1,075 resulted in a reduction of the
quantity of wheat made available from 12 tons/SAVS to 7 tons/SAVS.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Original Project
Rating: Unsatisfactory
95.      PCU. The PCU played its role of project administrator and coordinator, and
fulfilled its fiduciary role concerning procurement and financial management reasonably
well. However, despite having the mandate, it played a rather passive role vis-à-vis the
project executing agencies (SONADER and UNCACEM) and did not have the technical
capacity to monitor and, if necessary, control their performance.
96.     SONADER. SONADER’s operational and technical capacity decreased over time
due to the departure of key staff and insufficient Government support. It did not
satisfactorily fulfill the role that had been expected from it, namely to be the project’s
advisor and supervisor for irrigation rehabilitation and operation and maintenance
(O&M) and to provide agricultural extension advice of the quantity and quality needed
and expected.
97.     UNCACEM. UNCACEM was not able or unwilling to diversify its credit risks
through lending for activities other than agriculture and even for agricultural credit it was
either unable or unwilling to provide a line of credit in support of double cropping and
diversification activities promoted under the project. Ultimately, UNCACEM failed to
prevent its loan portfolio from deteriorating to the point where it was basically insolvent.
Following the floods and the food price crises in 2008, UNCACEM was not in a position
to resist Government interference in its lending policies and ended up acting not as an
independent bank but as a Government fund to distribute subsidized funds for rice
growers.

98.       CSA. CSA performed its role according to expectations.
99.     Department of Agriculture. The Department of Agriculture delivered fertilizer
on time but to fewer cooperative rice farmers than had been expected and at a subsidy
rate of 100 percent instead of 50 percent as was usually done before.
100. Department of Livestock. The Department of Livestock did not have the
operational capacity to reach the agreed upon targets in terms of additional animals
vaccinated each year, but it delivered a substantially increased vaccination program with
project support.
101. PIU. The AF was simple indeed, but the PIU executed the project as planned and
the available funds under the AF were fully disbursed.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory
102. While the former Government initially supported the PDIAIM and its underlying
policy letter, the support waned with the arrival of a new Government. The Minister of
MDR expressed his initial skepticism and later doubts about the concept of PDIAIM but
did not go as far as to ask IDA to reconsider its approach. A frank dialogue between the
Government and the Bank during that time might have allowed for a fresh start. The
executing agencies of PDIAIM II, especially SONADER and UNCACEM did not
perform as expected. In the case of the latter, it was the Government’s repetitive
interventions in its day to day operation that aggravated its financial situation.
SONADER never got the needed support from the Government (mainly in terms of
staffing). SONADER today is not stronger than it was at project start and UNCACEM
has been replaced by the CDD.
103. With respect to the AF, the Government fulfilled most of its obligations under the
AF. Especially noteworthy is the fact that it was proactive and that it used its own funds
to carry out part of project activities once it became clear that they could not be financed
in time with IDA funds. The executing agencies, despite some shortcomings, equally
performed their obligations in a satisfactory manner.
6. Lessons Learned
      •   A more participative and holistic approach. It is mainly due to the top-down
          approach (overly interventionist, overly focused on rehabilitation, too focused on
          achieving immediate results) used by both LPDAI and initial PAD of the project
          that led to the unsuccessful results: there was insufficient dialogue and
          consultation with the beneficiaries with respect to the rehabilitation works (from
          studies, supervision of the works and final hand-over); rehabilitation of perimeters
          was not necessarily the top priority of the communities (as there are many other
          risks and constraints such as floods, crop pests, land-locked positioning, lack of
          quality seed, etc.); some communities had limited capacities in terms of
          leadership and organization and management; and the results obtained in terms of
          quality of the rehabilitation works, economic profitability of the beneficiaries and
          sustainability of the diversification activities were precarious (also one of the
          reasons for the lack of interest from the private producers). Thus a much more



                                              28
    participative and holistic approach that would take into account the targeted
    communities constraints should be used.
•   Agricultural credit versus grants. For many producers, credit, especially long-
    term credit to finance part of irrigation rehabilitation, is not the appropriate
    instrument. As the first order of business, an irrigation project has to demonstrate
    to farmers that the volume and quality of their products (and thus income) will be
    enhanced through a given operation before farmers commit to the objective of the
    project. It is only after farmers bought into the idea and their activities started to
    generate sufficient cash revenue that credit, financing O&M and other services
    should be considered. In this case, a grant is a more appropriate instrument. If the
    objective is to make beneficiaries participate in the costs of rehabilitation,
    appropriate low-cost technical designs should be used and farmers should
    contribute with increased labor.
•   High costs investments on equipment and facilities should only be undertaken
    once ownership, operations and management have been well settled. Otherwise
    there is the real possibility, as was the case under PDIAIM I and II, that the
    equipment and facilities will not be used (case of facility in Rosso) or for
    completely different purposes (case of Nouakchott where the project financed a
    cold storage facility that was intended for vegetables to be exported and is now
    being used to conserve fish).
•   Even within APL scenario, there is no substitute to a timely project
    restructuring. Although the longer implementation period of an APL might
    suggest that there is ample time to resolve project design and implementation
    issues, teams should not shy away from project restructuring and should be
    encouraged by management to do so when needed.
•   Cost overruns can distort interpretation of disbursement figures. Satisfactory
    disbursement figures can be misleading as they may hide significant cost overruns,
    as was the case for irrigation rehabilitation under this project. In addition, APLs,
    by their very nature, have disbursement categories that are broad and not easy to
    match disbursements with quantitative achievement of physical outputs.

1.      Component A: Rural Incentives and Capacity Building – US$3.5 million

measures and incentives initiated under during Phase I, and improving the capacity of
national and regional rural institutions to implement the Program. It focused primarily on:
(i) collection and analysis of annual agricultural statistics; (ii) registration of land for
candidates to irrigation development; (iii) capacity building activities; and (iv) analytical
works related to a rural finance expansion strategy in the Senegal River Valley. Table 2.1
shows the degree of achievement of intermediate outcome indicators

2.       Intermediate Results Indicator 1: “SAFC/BAF process at least 75% of land
registration requests within one month.” Target not achieved (0%). SAFC had
serious resources problems due to the sudden withdrawal of the supports by the AFD and
EU. PDIAIM tried to take the relay under phase 2 but this was not sufficient, and thus the
institution could not adequately carry through its tasks. The ISR number 14 reported that
“regional land registries were introduced in all Prefectures and allow verification of land
awards on request”. However, capacity building of staff at regional level was considered
necessary to improve the registration process. Also, the elaboration of the land use plan
(schema de structure du foncier) in the Upper Senegal River Valley would have
increased the usefulness of this tool. Unfortunately, the land use plan for the Upper
Valley was never carried out. At the time of this ICR, only the SAFC/BAF office in
Rosso (Trarza Region) is still functioning and the Government has suspended the land
registration process as of February 2011. Also, the government seems to have changed its
approach to land titling. During the implementation of PDIAIM II, preliminary land titles
were a requirement of UNCACEM to access credit under the project. With the demise of
UNCACEM applicants will need full-fledged land titles in order to be able to access
credit
3.      Intermediate Results Indicator 2: “Strategy for rural finance expansion is
carried out.” Target achieved (100%). During the Mid-term review and several
implementation support missions, UNCACEM was asked to carry out a study to
determine how it could lower its credit risks while at the same time expanding its credit
products. The World Bank was particularly interested in seeing UNCACEM opening its
credit offerings to cover the credit needs of farmers engaged in double cropping and in
agricultural diversification activities. By December 2011, this study had been carried out
by an international consulting firm. However, by that time, the financial situation of
UNCACEM had deteriorated so much that the Government was no longer willing to use




                                               32
it as its tool for providing agricultural credit. As stated in earlier paragraphs, it eventually
replaced it by the CDD.
4.      Intermediate Results Indicator 3: “Annual agricultural statistics are produced
on time.” Target achieved (100%). For the whole period of PDIAIM II, the project
supported the MDRE’s unit of policy analysis and monitoring (DPCSE). It financed the
annual production of agricultural statistics, which were regularly produced. The only
weakness was the fact that DPCSE was not able to produce reliable statistics concerning
the volume of production of diversified crops.
5.      Intermediate Results Indicator 4: “75% of producer organizations (PO) of
large-scale public irrigation schemes collect adequate water and O&M charges.”
Target partially achieved (54%). Based on the assessment done in 2001, 54% of the
POs collected the charges. According to the Independent Evaluation, the results vary by
region: POs effectively collected all the charges (usage fee and maintenance of common
infrastructures) in the Trarza, while in the others (Brakna, Gorgol and Guidimagha) the
POs collection was limited to operational costs (usage fee and salaries).
6.      Component B: Infrastructure for Irrigated Agriculture – US$24.88 million
(IDA: US$21.11 million). This component, which was the largest (53 percent) of Phase
II aimed primarily at providing technical services and investment funds to land owners to
expand irrigation schemes, along with secure land tenure and capacity building provided
in other components. SONADER was to provide satisfactory supervision of irrigation
development and Phase III’s investment in irrigated agriculture was to be adequately
prepared. Table 2.2 shows the degree of achievement of the intermediate outcome
indicators.

No.                                 Indicator                              Targets      Actual

6       Planned priority feasibility studies for Phase III are completed   5 studies      0

7.      Intermediate Results Indicator 5: “No rehabilitation work straddles the rainy
season.” Target partially achieved (50%). This indicator was agreed in order to detect
and avoid costly delays in civil works related to irrigation rehabilitation; unless these
works are finished on time, a whole growing season is lost. However, this could not be
achieved. The first reason was that bigger international construction firms had never been
attracted to project implementation and thus only small local engineering firms (with
limited technical and financial capacity) participated. Secondly, the implementation
public institutions also suffered from this lack of capacity. An attempt was made, at
appraisal, to address this issue by introducing performance based contract with
SONADER to provide supervisory services. Moreover, several implementation support
missions mentioned this limited capacity, and tried to encourage the participation of
bigger construction firms from neighboring countries but in vain. In the end bigger
foreign construction firms did not participate in the rehabilitation works and the
performance contract between SONADER and the PCU was not adequately followed and
enforced. As a result, the rehabilitation component was beset with problems of poor
quality.

8.      Intermediate Results Indicator 6: “Planned priority feasibility studies for
Phase III are completed.” Target not achieved (0%). Since there was no Phase III, no
feasibility studies for a follow up operation were carried out. Nevertheless, PDIAIM II
financed a series of policy studies to assist the Government in defining its agricultural
development strategy.
9.     Component C: Support to Agricultural Supply Chains – US$10.94 million
(IDA: US$9.15 million). The aim was to provide the necessary assistance to the
development of a competitive rice subsector with improved quality of domestic rice, and
a diversified agricultural base, targeting rice and horticultural supply chain participants
engaged in domestic and export markets. It included three sub-components: C1: Support
to Basic Farm Management; C2: Support to the Rice Subsector; and C3: Promotion of
Agricultural Diversification. Table 2.3 shows the degree of achievement of the
intermediate outcome indicators

10.     Intermediate Results Indicator 7: “All rice rehabilitated area is sown with
improved seed.” Target largely achieved (90%). Based on data provided by the
project’s M&E system, during 2011, 90% of the rehabilitated area was sown with
improved seed. However, according to the report of the Independent Evaluation, there are
difficulties for farmers to obtain adequate amounts of credit on time. Also, the quality of
seed produced by some of the seed producers is of doubtful quality, even while they are
supposed to be controlled by the seed certification service of MDRE. According to field
reports, farmers are obliged to obtain rice seed from across the border in Senegal.
11.      Intermediate Results Indicator 8: “UNCACEM’s loan reimbursement rate
reaches at least 95% by the end of Phase II.” Target not achieved (0%). During the
initial years, implementation support missions reported that UNCACEM was performing
according to expectations. The MTR of April 2008 still reported that UNCACEM had
reached a financial self-sufficiency rate of 193% in 2007. However, starting in 2008, the
financial situation worsened drastically. For that year, the Government obliged the
institution to drastically increase its lending volume (loans per hectare) to encourage rice
production, since there had been a natural disaster in the previous year. UNCACEM had
to finance this lending through loans from a pool of commercial banks which carry a
100% Government guarantee. Most of the loans to producers were not repaid. The quasi
totality of UNCACEM loan portfolio was impaired. In December 2009, a decision by the
Prime Minister asked the Minister of Rural Development to instruct UNCACEM to
abandon all interest charges on its agricultural loans and forgive a large percentage of the
principal outstanding. During 2010, UNCACEM made no loans for agriculture and in


                                                 34
2011 it was only able to lend to agriculture because it received the funds needed from the
Government. UNCACEM ceased to be a financial institution and became a fund
receiving money from the Government which it distributed to farmers according to
instructions it received. In 2013, the Government decided to replace UNCACEM with a
new public institution lending for agriculture: Caisse de Dépôt et de Developpement.
12.      Intermediate Results Indicator 9: “Project-built storage and packaging
centers are functional.” Target not achieved (0%). In order to enable agricultural
diversification and especially the export of commercial horticultural products, under
PDIAIM I a cold storage and packing infrastructure was built at the Nouakchott’s airport
and in phase 2 the one Rosso was built. At that time, two producers/exporter GIEs were
formed and considerable international specialized technical assistance was provided.
Only at one time were products sent to the European market but could not be sold. This
initiative did not succeed. Today, the cold storage at the Nouakchott airport is used for
cold storage of fish and the cold storage and packing infrastructure in Rosso is empty and
not being used for lack of a private or private entrepreneurs interested in engaging in the
export of horticultural products.
13.     Intermediate Results Indicator 10: “Number of fruits and vegetable producers
linked to export markets has doubled by the end of Phase II.” Target not achieved
(0%). Only once at the end of Phase I were agricultural products (melons) exported to
Europe, and this with considerable support from a specialized international consulting
firm. The experience was not successful and has been abandoned. Thus as of December
2011, it was reported that the Project changed focus to local market and consequently, at
project closure, there were no exporters of fruits and vegetables linked to the project. The
infrastructure built to facilitate agricultural exports is not being used (case of storage
facility in Rosso) or used for other purposes (case of storage facility at the airport in
Nouakchott which is used for cold storage of fish products).
14.      Component D: Project Administration – US$7.34 million (IDA: US$5.98
million). It aimed at ensuring that the proper coordination of project activities,
implementation of the social and environmental safeguards, and the monitoring of
activities and evaluation of impacts. The component included three sub-components: D1:
Project Management and Coordination; D2: Monitoring and Evaluation; and D3:
Environmental and Social Safeguard Measures. Table 2.4 shows the degree of
achievement of the intermediate outcome indicators.

major reserves.” Target achieved (100%). Audit reports were produced by June 30 of
each year and were unqualified.



                                                35

schedule.
17.    Intermediate Results Indicator 13: “Impact analysis studies are carried out
(implementation of land tenure, social assessment, rural public expenditures).
Target partially achieved (50%). Public expenditure review and study on rural
development strategy were carried out. However, the land tenure study was not carried
out and the report on the social assessment is no longer available.
18.    Component E: Emergency and Food Price Response – US$10.0 million (IDA:
US$5.0 million and FPCR-TF: US$5.0 million). This component was in response to the
Government’s request for emergency support and its objective was to improve
availability of critical agricultural inputs and food staples for targeted beneficiaries. It had
two sub-components: E.1: Agricultural and Livestock Productivity Enhancement; and
E.2: Support to Food Safety Net. After restructuring, the supply of critical agricultural
inputs (fertilizers and veterinary products) was financed by and became the sole
responsibility of the Government. Table 2.5 shows the degree of achievement of the
intermediate outcome indicators.

         during the period of food shortage

19.      Intermediate Results Indicator 14: “Additional volume of fertilizers
distributed to farmers.” Indicator partially achieved (37%). In the Results
Framework of the AF it was envisaged to supply 29,000 farmers (0.5 ha of rice per
farmer) with 4,400 tons of urea. In actual fact, about 1,600 tons were distributed during
2011/2012 and 2012/2013 to an additional 10,000 beneficiaries. The initial quantity of
fertilizer to be distributed as well as the number of beneficiaries was overestimated and
unrealistic from the beginning. Also, the Government decided to subsidize the fertilizer
100% and not 50% as had been done before. No reliable data are available on the
percentage of women farmers that were provided with urea.

cropping season, compared to an objective of 80%.
21.     Intermediate Results Indicator 16: “Additional number of livestock
vaccinated (disaggregated by type of livestock/vaccines).” While the target for large
ruminants was partially achieved (84%) the target for small ruminants was
overachieved (125%). The Government allocated substantial additional resources to
livestock vaccination campaigns during 2011/2012 and 2012/2013. However, the
objectives were overambitious and did not take into account the limited operational
capacity of the Directorate of Livestock for such vaccination campaigns. Monitoring set-
up was weak and did not allow the disaggregation of data by gender and category of
herder.
22.    Intermediate Results Indicator 17: “Additional number of livestock
benefitting from treatment with veterinary products.’ Indicator partially achieved
(83%). Same comment as under Intermediate Results Indicator 16 above.
23.     Intermediate Results Indicator 18: “Additional number of SAVS (Stock
Alimentaires Villageois de Sécurité) stocked up to meet the food demand of
beneficiaries during the period of food shortage. Indicator fully achieved (over
100%). The original objective of the AF was to distribute 7,200 tons of wheat to 600
SAVS but the government decided to distribute wheat to 1,070 SAVS. After restructuring,
4,500 tons of wheat were added to be distributed to an additional 450 SAVS. This
objective was also met.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
1.      As stated in the PAD of phase 2 no “Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) was carried out
for the whole project because benefits of capacity building activities defy quantification,
and benefits from investments in safeguard measures cannot be easily quantified in
monetary terms”. Consequently, only an illustrative CBA of irrigation development in
rehabilitation, extension and new creation, undertaken by cooperatives and private
individual producers. The analysis considered three illustrative investment models (rice
sole cropping, rice and diversified crops, and diversification in vegetables, fruits and
forage production) undertaken by cooperative and private individual farmers operating in
the Trarza and Haut-Fleuve. The results were very positive and the ERR for the various
investment models varied from 14% (rice only) to 22% (rice + diversification) and 23-
62% for diversification only.
2.      During the Mid-Term Review (MTR) of the project in April 2008, the ERR for
three perimeters (Casier Pilote de Boghe – 790ha; Périmètre Pilote du Gorgol 1 – 690ha;
and Périmètre Pilote du Gorgol 2 – 1188ha) was recalculated taking into account the
increased rice price at the time (from 60 UM/kg to 115 UM/kg). According to the MTR
Aide-Memoire, the ERR and Benefit/Cost Ratios were as follows:
   -   Casier Pilote de Boghe                ERR: 28.3% RB/C : 2,64
   -   Périmètre Pilote du Gorgol 1          ERR : 31.1% RB/C : 2.65
   -   Périmètre Pilote du Gorgol 2          ERR : 44.7% RB/C : 3.62
3.      The critical assumptions made at that time were: a) average yields in the absence
of natural catastrophes: 4 t/ha before rehabilitation, 5 t/ha in year 1 and 6 t/ha the
following years, and b) a rehabilitation cost per ha of 1.6 million UM (without pumps),
and c) a price of paddy of estimated at 98 MU/kg.
4.     This ICR did not undertake a CBA as it applies to the final project outcome,
because of lack of data (see M&E section). Nevertheless, it reexamined the analysis done
during MTR, to see its usefulness. The conclusion of this evaluation is that the
assumptions made during the MTR did not hold. Given the final outcomes of the project,
it would only make sense to evaluate the situation against the rice growing model, as this
is the one practiced by the overwhelming majority of farmers in the rehabilitated
perimeters.
5.      During PDIAIM I, the average unit costs of rehabilitation was 525,000 UM/ha
and the repayment corresponded at the time to an annual repayment equivalent to about 1
ton of paddy. Thus to finance this with short- and long-term loans given UNCACEM’s
interest rates and repayment conditions, rice production was profitable provided yields
were above 3t/ha and repayment of the debt over medium and long-term was possible
with a yield slightly higher than 2.5 tons/ha.
6.      During the second phase, the average unit costs of rehabilitation increased to over
1.4 million UM/ha (going as high as 2 million UM/ha for some of the regions) (see table
3.1 below). The main reasons for these cost increases were: (a) price inflation; (b)
changes in the level of rehabilitation (originally, it was foreseen only to finance the
principal and secondary irrigation channels but not tertiary irrigation channels land
leveling. Later on, this was changed); (c)inclusion of funding for protective dams; (d)


                                            38
    great geographic dispersion of rehabilitation sites; (e) difficult physical access (no roads)
    to some rehabilitation sites; (f) difficult morphology of the sites in the Haut-Fleuve.

    7.     Thus with the increase in price, though the annual repayment remained at 1 ton of
    paddy, rice production was now profitable only with yields over 4t/ha, and just to repay
    the annual loan costs required yields equivalent to 3.5 tons/ha.
    8.      According to the independent evaluators, the yields in the rehabilitated perimeters
    are estimated at only 4t/ha. Thus in all the perimeters were the rehabilitation costs were
    above 1.4 million UM/ha, it was clear that cooperative farmers had difficulties not only in
    servicing their loans but also with the profitability of the rice production. For example for
    the perimeter of Diaguily, where the rehabilitation cost was 2.9 million UM/ha, rice
    production will only be profitable only with a yield of more than 5.5 tons/ha and annual
    repayment equivalent to 1.7 tons of paddy. And this can only be possible with a yield of
    at least 4 tons/ha, resulting thus in zero cash-flow after repayment over the loan period
    (see table 3.2 below).
    9.      For private irrigation farmers (up to 40ha), the credit conditions for participating
    in PDIAIM II were not attractive. They would have had to pay 70% of the rehabilitation
    costs. This would have been only feasible and interesting if they had achieved yields of
    about 5t/ha.

   10.     The project also failed in terms of achieving the set target for cropping intensity.
   The PAD had as an objective to reach a cropping intensity of 150% and to introduce crop
   diversification on a large scale. It has to be pointed out, that there is a great variability
   between the different perimeters and while some perform well, other perimeters are in a
   worse state than they were before the rehabilitation. As it can be seen in table 3.3 below,
   the average results during 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 were cropping intensity of 60%, and
   crop diversification happened only on 1% of the rehabilitated areas (corn, sorghum, and
   vegetable growing) in two small irrigation perimeters.

11.     The main reasons for the low cropping intensity were: (i) poor quality of the
rehabilitated perimeters (some plots received too much, others too little irrigation); (ii)
problems linked to pumping equipment; (iii) lack of social cohesion and poor leadership
in some of the cooperatives; (iv) complete dependence on credit which is risky since
many events can lead to repayment arrears and therefore to ineligibility for credit; (v)
credit system that only provided credit for rice growing in the rainy season but not for
double cropping or production of crops other than rice; (vi) insufficient availability of
agricultural machinery for land preparation and harvesting; and (vii) insufficient
agricultural advice from SONADER extension agents.

REALISATIONS
1.     Depuis la mise en vigueur du PDIAIM II, l’équipe du PDIAIM s’est attelée à la
réalisation d’activités visant l’atteinte des objectifs de la deuxième phase et à consolider
les acquis de la première phase, l’objectif ultime étant de jeter les bases nécessaires
pour un développement durable de l’agriculture irriguée.
2.     C’est ainsi que plusieurs actions ont été réalisées. Il s’agit notamment de :
            L’exécution des travaux de réhabilitation de 21 périmètres collectifs situés
             dans les wilayas du Trarza, du Brakna du Gorgol et du Guidimakha. Ces
             périmètres totalisent une superficie globale de 1700,7 ha. La mise en valeur
             de ces périmètres est affectée par plusieurs handicaps dont notamment les
             défauts d’aménagement, le manque d’équipements de pompage,
             l’organisation et la cohésion sociale…
            L’exécution de l’étude relative à l’aménagement de la zone agricole de
             Wandama à Kaédi et sa restitution auprès des exploitations de la plaine.
             Après constat de la cherté de l’aménagement proposé, Une deuxième étude
             complémentaire est en cours d’exécution pour un aménagement future de la
             plaine.
            L’appui aux opérateurs de la diversification pour une superficie globale de
             974,95 ha. Ces superficies portent sur des cultures maraîchères et fruitières
             à haute valeur ajoutée. Elles ont bénéficié à environ 4375 individus dont
             2220 femmes.
            Le recrutement d’une firme internationale pour l’appui au développement et
             à la promotion de la diversification
            L’élaboration des plans de développement stratégique (PDS) des filières
             oignon et patate douce
            Le développement et le renforcement des statistiques agricoles à travers les
             enquêtes sur les ménages et exploitations agricoles. Ces enquêtes EMEA
             sont effectuées annuellement sur financement du PDIAIM en vue de mettre
             à disposition du Département des données fiables et exhaustives sur les
             superficies et les productions agricoles.
            Raccordement électrique de la station de pompage du périmètre pilote du
             Gorgol (PPGI) au réseau de la SOMELEC
            La contribution aux efforts entrepris par le Département du développement
             rural pour la lutte anti-aviaire à travers la fourniture de produits
             phytosanitaires, en l’occurrence 10.000 litres d’avicides. Cet appui s’est
             accompagné par la fourniture d’équipements pour la lutte mécanique contre
             les oiseaux granivores;




                                            46
           L’appui aux structures chargées de la filière semencière pour le suivi, le
            contrôle et la certification des semences.
           L’établissement d’un contrat programme tripartite entre le Ministère du
            développement rural (MDR), l’UNCACEM et les établissements
            semenciers. Ce contrat vise à assurer le financement des semences
            sélectionnées.
           La mise en œuvre de la convention signée avec la SONADER pour
            l’exécution du volet relatif au conseil rural. Cette convention porte sur
            l’appui conseil aux périmètres réhabilités, l’appui au transfert de la gestion
            des ouvrages collectifs des grands périmètres ainsi que l’appui aux activités
            génératrices de revenus en faveurs des femmes…
           La conduite de l’étude relative à la revue des dépenses publiques du secteur
            rural.
           La conduite de l’étude d’actualisation de la stratégie de développement du
            secteur rural à l’horizon 2025.
           Dans le cadre du financement additionnel exécuté à partir de 2013 la
            distribution de 1616 tonnes d’urée additionnels au profit 10 084
            bénéficiaires dont 2 795 femmes, vaccination de 2 395 884 animaux au
            profit de 78 315 dont 28 000 femmes et fourniture de 11.700 tonnes
            métriques de blé au profit de 1520 SAVS pour 305 500 individus dont 122
            200 femmes , répartis sur dix wilayas du pays.
CONTRAINTES
  •   La complexité du montage du programme et la multiplicité de ses centres
      d’exécution a pesé lourdement sur le déroulement de ces activités. Il faut ajouter à
      cela l’instabilité du staff technique au niveau de ces structures ce qui a entraîné la
      déperdition des efforts et des informations ;
  •   Le manque de professionnalisme des entreprises et bureaux de contrôle au niveau
      national a constitué un sérieux handicap sur la qualité des périmètres réhabilités ;
  •   Le non performance de certains services étatiques surtout pour l’accompagnement
      et le suivi rigoureux des actions sur le terrain notamment la SONADER en ce qui
      concerne le volet réhabilitation, le Centre de Contrôle de la Qualité des Semences
      et Plans pour la certification des semences et la Direction de l’Aménagement
      Rural (Service foncier) en ce qui concerne la rapidité des procédures de
      régularisation foncière ;
  •   Les périmètres réhabilités ont souffert d’un certain nombre de contraintes. Il s’agit
      notamment du fait que la réhabilitation ne comprend pas les équipements de
      pompage ; Il s’en suit que la réception provisoire est souvent faite à l’aide
      d’anciens équipements du périmètre généralement vétustes ou par les propres
      moyens de l’entreprise. En conséquence, on observe parfois des périmètres qui
      restent en jachère pendant une ou plusieurs campagnes consécutives en attendant
      que la coopérative trouve le moyen (avec ou sans crédit) d’équiper le périmètre en
      moyen d’exhaure (cas de Sarandougou, Diaguili, Najah II, Fraye Boss etc….).


                                           47
    Ces périmètres qui n’ont pas pu être mis en valeur dès la première campagne se
    dégradent davantage sous l’effet conjugué des intempéries et de la divagation
    des animaux. Ainsi, on se heurte à des difficultés de procéder à la réception
    définitive du périmètre car d’une part, l’entreprise ne se considère plus
    responsable de l’état du périmètre et d’autre part, la coopérative estime que le
    périmètre ainsi dégradé ne peut pas être mis en valeur de manière convenable. . A
    cela s’ajoute le fait que le bureau du contrôle dont le contrat s’arrête à la
    réception provisoire, se désengage et ne participe plus à l’arbitrage entre les
    parties prenantes.
•   Manque d’engouement pour la réhabilitation du PDIAIM qui comporte un volet
    crédit (80 % pour les privés) alors que d’autres projets font des aménagements
    clef en main ce qui est de nature à limiter la superficie totale réhabilitée en plus
    des coûts élevés de réalisation des périmètres irrigués par rapport aux prévisions
    initiales ;
•   Malgré le fait que l’UNCACEM devait étendre ses activités de crédits à la
    diversification et aux cultures autres que le riz, il a été constaté que ceci n’a pas
    eu lieu surtout pour les coopératives féminines qui pratiquent les cultures
    maraîchères essentiellement;
•   Manque de rigueur dans la certification des semences constatée pour certains
    établissements semenciers dont les semences dites « certifiées » ont des pouvoirs
    germinatifs qui se sont révélés faibles.
•   Environnement de production défavorable (abondance des oiseaux granivores,
    prolifération de typha, inondations chroniques de certains périmètres) ;
•   Problème de mécanisation : l’insuffisance des tracteurs occasionne le retard du
    démarrage des campagnes agricoles et donc la baisse de la productivité et
    l’insuffisance des moissonneuses-batteuses entraîne la difficulté de récolte en
    temps opportun et donc des pertes énormes allant parfois à un abandon total des
    parcelles ;
•   La faible mobilité des services du conseil rural au niveau des zones de
    production, qui handicape la supervision de leurs activités ;
•   L’insuffisance de financement pour élargir l’action du conseil et mettre en place
    de véritables pôles de développement qui serviront de référence pour les
    agriculteurs et les services du conseil rural. Cette contrainte n’a pas permis à la
    SONADER de faire de la sous-traitance du conseil rural pour les zones et les
    catégories d’agriculteurs qui ne sont pas suffisamment couvertes par le dispositif
    de la SONADER ;
•   Un environnement peu favorable à la diversification surtout au niveau des petits
    producteurs, avec le manque d’infrastructures de conservation, de transformation,
    et de stockage et la forte concurrence des produits importés des pays
    limitrophes ;
•   Absence d’un système de financement de la double campagne compatible avec la
    réalité du petit producteur et favorisant l’augmentation de l’intensité culturale ;


                                         48
  •   La non réhabilitation à ce jour de certains grands périmètres (PPGII. CPB, Foum
      Gleïta, R’Kiz) constitue un obstacle à la négociation des documents officiels de
      transfert notamment les projets de convention de transfert qui sont disponibles.
PRINCIPAUX ENSEIGNEMENTS
  •   Renforcement des capacités des structures impliquées dans la mise en œuvre par
      la conduite d’études spécifiques et la formation de leur personnel,
  •   Libéralisation de la filière rizicole : Le PDIAIM était à l’origine de la
      libéralisation de la filière riz qui était le monopole d’un pool d’acheteurs. Ceci a
      favorisé la compétitivité entre les différents acteurs comme les agriculteurs qui
      ont commencé á améliorer la qualité du riz qu’ils produisent car les prix sont
      devenus fonction d’un test de qualité ; Les commerçants et les usiniers donnent
      des prix plus rémunérateurs au meilleur riz ;
  •   Création d’une dynamique de diversification basée sur le secteur
  •   L’appui conseil a permis de renouveler les semences de riz           habituellement
      utilisées par les agriculteurs avec des variétés plus performantes
  •   Professionnalisation des acteurs impliqués dans la mise en œuvre du Programme
RECOMMANDATIONS
  •   Alléger le montage institutionnel des projets dans le futur et éviter la duplication
      des responsabilités ;
  •   Renforcer le dispositif de supervision et de suivi évaluation à tous les niveaux
      d’exécution ;
  •   Améliorer la présence des services du conseil rural sur le terrain pour assurer un
      accès rapide et performant aux services agricoles
  •   Améliorer l’approche de vulgarisation notamment par la mise en place de pôles de
      références ;
  •   Instaurer la double culture et améliorer la sole des cultures de diversification pour
      augmenter la rentabilité des aménagements hydro agricoles,
  •   Réhabiliter et engager le processus du transfert au niveau des grands périmètres.
  •   Encourager la contractualisation avec des opérateurs spécialisés pour la production
      de plants, de semences et de boutures afin d’encourager la diversification ;
  •   Adopter l’approche filières et apporter les appuis nécessaires à tous les maillons de
      la chaine
  •   Etablir une liste noire d’entreprises et bureaux de contrôle qui ont failli à leurs
      engagements ;
  •   Harmoniser les interventions en matière de politiques de développement dans le
      domaine de l’irrigation.

Annex 9. UNCACEM
1.      Credit for Diversification by UNCACEM. Despite the fact that credit for
diversification was foreseen in the PAD and UNCACEM was reminded by several
implementation support missions of the importance of this type of credit, UNCACEM
never provided credit for diversification with the exception of two agricultural export
enterprises (GDM) and Horti-Mauritanie. Those credits were never fully reimbursed.
2.      Operational and financial autonomy of UNCACEM. Despite its legal status as
a cooperative belonging to its members, UNCACEM has been the Government’s arm for
providing financing to the agricultural sector. It has functioned more as a fund charged
with distributing public resources to farmers than as a credit institution. The Bank’s line
of credit provided to UNCACEM was in addition to the funds provided by the
Government without affecting or changing the modus operandi of UNCACEM.
UNCACEM ’s operations were based on instructions (circulaire) of the MDR that fixed
the volume of credit to be provided per agricultural campaign and per ha
3.      UNCACEM’s problems were already existent under phase 1, where it was faced
with delay in loan repayments (mainly due to natural disasters and delays in land title
regularization). This was exasperated under phase 2, and especially starting 2007 due to
the natural disasters, the global food price crisis, the 2008 political unrest and the
repetitive government interventions. A performance review of UNCACEM carried out by
a WB consultant in December 2011 found that the institution was in a difficult financial
situation. This review mission went to Rosso, where UNCACEM is headquartered to
meet with the general manager and his staff and subsequently in a meeting in Nouakchott
met with the Chairman of the Board and Board members and with the supervisor at the
central Bank (BCM). The review mission based its analysis on the World Bank funded
external audit of 2010 based on consolidated data.
4.          Major findings of this mission were that:
     (i)       Regulatory banking supervision. There had been no on-sight inspection of
               UNCACEM by the Central Bank (BCM) since 2007. This constituted a
               regulatory/supervisory failure for which the Government, the management of
               UNCACEM and the supervisory authority were responsible.
     (ii)      Balance Sheet of UNCACEM. For 2010, UNCACEM boasted total assets of
               23.7 billion UM. However, there was a claim on the Government of 9.2
               billion resulting from a decision by the Prime Minister to abandon interest
               collection and to forgive a percentage of the principal. This amount should
               have been provisioned. In addition, there were other credits by UNCACEM
               that were not repaid and should have been provisioned. Altogether, the
               provisions should have been for a total of 19.1 billion UM.
     (iii)     Income and Expenditure Statement of UNCACEM. In 2010, the net banking
               product was 250 million UM and net profit minus (-) 1.3 billion UM before
               provision, or minus (-) 20.4 billion UM including the provisioning stated
               above.
     (iv)      Net worth of UNCACEM. Depending on how one treats Government
               advances for lending in 2011 and whether UNCACEM should have applied


                                                51
            all the provisions mentioned above, the net worth of the institution becomes
            negative by 12.6 to 17.2 billion UM.
5.      In conclusion, by December 2011 it was clear that UNCACEM was in a difficult
financial situation, with negative net worth and little resources. It could not continue
operating in its current condition and future lending for agriculture became dependent
completely on Government advances.
6.       The reasons for the demise of UNCACEM are several:
     -   Interventions by Government
     -   Lack of land titles. UNCACEM accepted other documents (called precarious land
         titles) such as exploitation permits
     -   Inadequate regulatory/supervisory context
     -   Insufficient profitability of rice growing, i.e. insufficient cash revenue to honor
         repayment obligations.
7.      It is the contention of this ICR, that the key reason for the demise of UNCACEM
was the last factor: insufficient profitability of rice growing and the fact that many
cooperative irrigation farmers were not in a financial position to repay their short-term
loans for agricultural inputs and especially their long-term rehabilitation loans. With
respect to the last point, as shown above, with the high costs of rehabilitation (1.7 million
UM/ha) farmers would have only been able to honor their financial obligations towards
UNCACEM if their paddy yields would have been above 4t/ha, which often was not the
case. Farmers would have had to spend the equivalent of 3.5t/ha of paddy just to meet
their annual financial obligations. The problem was not immediately visible. Under these
circumstances, the problem was more an economic than a legal one. Legally enforceable
land titles given as loan guarantee would not have been sufficient to halt the decline of
UNCACEM, as it is politically inconceivable that the majority of irrigation farmers
would have lost their land due to economic reasons of incapacity to repay their loans.
8.      A study of UNCACEM was carried out by a consulting firm (Meridies) that
proposed four main scenarios for its restructuring. The one chosen by Government was
the creation of a new public bank (Caisse de Depot).
9.      Historical performance of UNCACEM. In 2007, the German development bank
(KFW) carried out an ex-post evaluation of one of their projects in support of
UNCACEM. This project, with investment costs of EUR 1.28 million, had as its overall
objective to contribute to stabilizing and raising family incomes, to securing employment
opportunities and to developing rural financial systems. The project objective was the
granting of loans on a sustainably efficient base to target-group agricultural units.
10.     Some of the main findings of the evaluation were that the ”portfolio at risk” figure
was very high (46%), and many of the loans in the remaining 54% of the portfolio were
not declared as in arrears for the sole reason that they had been rescheduled. Moreover,
no significant contribution was made to the development of rural finance systems, as the
credit technology needed to underpin sustainable structural improvements was not
introduced, for example in terms of loan collateralization systems or the establishment of
a risk fund.




                                             52
11.     The overall assessment of the development policy effectiveness of the project
concluded that while the relevance of the project was satisfactory, effectiveness was
unsatisfactory, efficiency was highly unsatisfactory, and overarching development impact
and sustainability were both unsatisfactory.
12.    The report noted particularly a reticence on the part of UNCACEM’s
management to embrace “state of the art banking”, and an apparent lack of interest in
reducing dependence on external donor funding by aiming for an improved and realistic
cost-cover ratio and attracting customer deposits.
13.     The report concluded by pointing out that banking effectiveness indicators based
solely on balance sheet and the profit and loss account provide a reliable picture but are
subject to a certain delay. In critical cases, in addition the balance sheet and the profit and
loss account, other operative parameters (e.g. changes in the volume of loan portfolio,
loan rescheduling, risk adjustments, liquidity development) should therefore be defined
as indicators and monitored.

Annex 10. Independent Evaluation of PDIAIM
No stakeholder workshop or beneficiary survey was carried out. However, from January
18 to February 6, 2014 an independent evaluation of PDIAIM was done by a team of 5
consultants (two international and three national). Team leader was Joel Hourticq,
agricultural economist. The other team members were Abdoulaye Dicko (international
expert in civil engineering), Mohamed Baba (national expert in civil engineering),
Mohamed Didi (national expert in rural credit), and Isakha Diagana (national expert in
land tenure legislation) Below is a presentation of the executive summary of the team’s
report.
                               EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
i.       This assessment focuses on irrigation and support for diversification development
activities implemented during phases 1 and 2 of the Programme de Développement
Intégré de l’Agriculture Irriguée en Mauritanie or PDIAIM (Program for the Integrated
Development of Irrigated Agriculture in Mauritania). It builds on the analysis of available
documents, a field survey and interviews with many resource persons. The field survey,
which lasted 10 days, allowed for visits of 22 out of the 33 perimeters rehabilitated by the
PDIAIM, as well as of a number of other project achievements throughout the affected
regions (Trarza, Brakna, Gorgol and Guidimagha) and meetings with many beneficiaries’
representatives. It must be noted however that the work put into this assessment was
undermined by the almost complete lack of a formal report on the project’s realizations,
whether from the PDIAIM’s Coordination Unit (UC-PDIAIM) or the implementation
agencies.
ii.     The PDIAIM was designed based on Adaptable Program Lending (APL), which
was originally supposed to be rolled out in three phases of 3, 4 and 4 years respectively.
The first phase, totaling $46.6 M (of which $36.8 M on IDA credit), was initially planned
for 2000 to 2002 and was extended for two years until the end of 2004. Its development
objective was to set up the foundations for a sustainable management of irrigated
agriculture in the valley of the Senegal River, from a technical, financial, economic and
environmental point of view. The second phase, amounting to a total of $46.6 M (of
which $39 M on IDA credit), was extended during its ex-ante assessment to 5.5 years,
from mid-2005 to the end of 2010. Having been penalized by a 16-month suspension of
disbursements from August of 2008 to November 2009, following the coup in August
2008, it had to be extended two years until the end of 2012 in order to complete the
initiated activities and use the available credits. This second phase’s objective was to
consolidate and build upon the gains of phase 1, in particular: (i) to consolidate key
incentive measures; (ii) increase viable irrigation perimeters; (iii) intensify the
diversification of irrigated agriculture production. The idea for a third phase was finally
dropped. After 2012, the PDIAIM served as a channel for additional financing from the
World Bank and the GFRP for an emergency program unrelated to the initial objective or
the project’s usual activities. For this reason, its closing date has been pushed back
several times and is now set for the end of May 2014. The IDA credits meant for the first
two phases have been completely used up.




                                            54
iii.    The vision governing the setup of the PDIAIM towards the end of the 1990s was
to make the Senegal River one of the main sources of economic development and growth
in the country, by making the most efficient use of its limited water and land resources, in
order to result in rapid social and economic growth driven by the private sector. In
particular, the PDIAIM fell within the implementation of the Lettre de Politique de
Développement de l'Agriculture Irriguée or LPDAI (Policy letter for the development of
irrigated agriculture) adopted in 1999, which aimed at lifting constraints faced by
irrigated agriculture: (i) low-quality land use planning resulting in under-farming or
complete neglect (it was estimated in 1999 that over 135,000 ha of potentially irrigable
land, 47,000 ha were developed for agriculture but less than 20,000 ha were farmed each
year); (ii) poor management and lack of maintenance of irrigated perimeters; (iii) poor
organizational and technical capacity of the farmers (iv) land-locked irrigated areas; (v)
poor profitability of irrigated perimeters due to a low level of intensification,
diversification and incorporation within national, regional and international markets; (vi)
lack of financing for irrigated agriculture; (vii) lack of property securing, whether
individual or collective, which is detrimental to investment in irrigation and infrastructure
maintenance; (viii) environmental deterioration linked to irrigation contributing to
waterlogging and soil salinization.
iv.     Moreover, the PDIAIM was launched with the Mauritanian government’s
commitment to set up and maintain a new framework for the sale of locally grown rice,
so as to make it more competitive in relation to imported rice, both in terms of price and
quality. This commitment was upheld and the hoped-for results were achieved. The end
of the 2000s and beginning of the 2010s saw massive state intervention in the local rice
trade, which, in correlation with the increase in global rice prices, led to significant
improvements in local rice production profitability and a boom in production since 2010,
the sustainability of which however remains to be seen.
v.      In order to reach its development objective, the PDIAIM’s favored strategy was to
rehabilitate and expand, insofar as this was economically justified, perimeters still being
farmed, in order to make them move towards sustainable means of production
incorporating intensive rice production and other speculations. In particular, the first two
phases provided for the rehabilitation of 5,500 ha of rice-growing perimeters
(communally and privately owned) and the creation of 650 ha of new perimeters
dedicated to diversification.
vi.    Three implementation agencies were responsible for the project’s implementation,
each one with access to a special account directly replenished by the IDA:
   a. SONADER, developer appointed to the supervision of public infrastructure plans
       and works, consulting engineer of the UC-PDIAIM in charge of monitoring the
       preparation and implementation of the development of irrigated perimeters
       financed by the project, responsible for R&D activities in regard to drainage and
       pumping, as well as in charge of producer support when it came to agricultural
       popularization and perimeter management;




                                             55
     b.   The UNCACEM 17, in charge of granting loans to finance perimeter development,
           production and product processing;
     c. And finally the UC-PDIAIM, in charge of political and institutional framework
         strengthening activities, incentive support management for the rehabilitation of
         rice-growing perimeters, diversification initiatives and activities to promote
         diversification and the project’s general coordination as well as its M&E.
vii.    This assessment has shown that in terms of irrigation development and
diversification, the project’s results are rather underwhelming. In regard to the
rehabilitation of perimeters, the inflation of unit costs has led to achievements reaching
only 40% of the objectives, with the quality of works considered mediocre overall, an
average reclamation rate of barely 60% and paddy rice yields close to 4 t/h, which is no
higher, or only marginally higher, than the yields from non-rehabilitated perimeters
(when the initial economic analysis was based on a 150% cultural intensity and 6 t/ha
yields after rehabilitation). Moreover, private farmers refused to take part in the perimeter
rehabilitation component.
viii. Likewise, it is difficult to conclude there has been a significant increase in
diversification thanks to the project: firstly, the project mostly worked with communities
that were already engaged in diversification activities; secondly, if it did manage to prove
the feasibility/interest of certain speculations, cultural practices and outlets, it generally
had no effect on the constraints affecting their sustainability and, consequently, a
significant number of innovations that were introduced ceased to be used at the end of the
project; thirdly, studies on sector businesses did not lead to the implementation of
national strategies despite strong potential in some speculations.
ix.     Regarding agricultural credit, PDIAIM results were also underwhelming: even
though it can be considered to have contributed to the emergence of a significant number
of private paddy fields, the uncontrolled debt of the cooperatives generated a
considerable number of outstanding loans and led to the non-viability of the only
agricultural credit institution, the UNCACEM, now in the process of being replaced by a
state institution, the functioning method of which is not yet precisely known. Contrary to
what was intended, the credit was not extended to diversification or even out-of-season
rice growing.
x. Concerning property securing, much progress was made from a legal standpoint
(numerous decrees and orders). However, only a thousand cases were resolved in the
river valley, mostly in Trarza, in more than 10 years. And, despite the support of the
project, the regional SAFC 18 and BAFs 19, except the one from Rosso, came out greatly
weakened and, for some, non-operational. The assessment of the Trarza structural
blueprints was not carried out despite repeated recommendations from monitoring

missions to do so. Finally, the ambiguity between permanent concession and title deed
persists and, in many cases, particularly for women, the granted concession titles
represented more of an open sesame to access the project than a real and permanent
property securing.
xi.      There is no need for calculations; the economic profitability of the project’s
irrigation and diversification components is without doubt negative. It is important to try
and learn from this in order to avoid making the same mistakes in future programs.
xii.    The reasons given for the project’s underwhelming results have often been the
innovative characteristic of the approach (combination of credit and AI), the weakness of
the implementation agencies, particularly SONADER, the limited capacities of
engineering and design departments and contracting businesses, the limited capacities of
beneficiaries, the speculative nature of private investments in irrigation, property issues
and competition from other projects that subsidize investments entirely. However, the
analysis developed in this study shows that, although the mediocre quality of the works
and weakness of implementation agencies are partly responsible for the underwhelming
results, the project’s first restriction lies in an overly interventionist approach, one too
focused on rehabilitation and achieving immediate results instead of on appropriation and
sustainability. Such an approach inevitably led to a loss of control over the quality and
cost of the works and, as a logical consequence, to a lack of interest from private
producers.
xiii. Overly interventionist approach: The LPDAI and initial PAD of the project were
based on the principle that the appropriation of the project by the beneficiaries would be
guaranteed by the fact that a substantial part of the investment would be financed on
credit. The facts show that this mechanism did not have the expected effects and the
degree to which the land and infrastructure were appropriated by the beneficiaries
remained small for the following reasons:
   a.    Possible pressure exerted by the engineering and design departments and
         contractors to arouse “interest” within communities and win over the market or
         obtain temporary works;
   b.    Insufficient dialogue and consultation with the beneficiaries throughout the
         process, from the initial study to the supervision and completion of works;
   c.    The perimeter’s rehabilitation was not necessarily the top priority of the
         beneficiary communities (see further down);
   d.    The limited capacities of certain communities in terms of leadership,
         organization and management;
   e.    The development of a “handout” mindset that led communities to passively
         accept all exterior interventions, a state of mind clearly exacerbated by the
         state’s massive intervention in the rice sector since 2007;
   f.    And finally, the loss of credibility of the notion of credit, with the experience of
         the last few years showing beneficiaries that credit sooner or later becomes a
         subsidy.




                                            57
xiv. An approach overly focused on rehabilitation: recent studies 20, consistent with the
observations made during the mission, have shown that communities producing rice in
the river valley face many risks and constraints (floods, crop pests (birds, crickets,
rodents), land-locked positioning, lack of pumping means, lack of soil preparation means,
harvesting and threshing, lack of quality seed, lack of funds for a double crop or
diversification, impossibility of an out-of-season agriculture in certain areas), which
means that the rehabilitation of their rice-growing perimeter is not necessarily one of
their top priorities. Moreover, these same studies have also shown the limited profitability
of rice production, both in absolute and relative terms (compared to other crops or
activities performed by these same communities). In particular, these studies have shown
that without a double crop, rice production is not profitable at current yield levels if the
maintenance costs of the perimeter are taken into account. This result, coupled with the
potentially bad quality of the rehabilitation works, explains the weak cultural intensity
observed on most rehabilitated perimeters (by the PDIAIM and other similar projects):
the rehabilitated perimeters are farmed as long as there is no need for maintenance and
then progressively abandoned. Moreover, the mission’s observations have also shown
that the affected communities are extremely vulnerable to the risks they face and that any
adverse event during the agricultural season can easily place them in a very insecure
situation, from which they may take years to recover. During these years they would no
longer have access to credit and subsidized inputs to farm their perimeter, which in turn
would deteriorate all the more rapidly.
xv.      An approach too focused on rehabilitation and achieving immediate results
instead of on appropriation and sustainability: whether it be perimeter rehabilitation or
diversification, it is clear that notions of appropriation and sustainability have been
largely neglected. This is due in part to the weakness of the M&E system set up within
the UC-PDIAIM, which is known for being efficient when it comes to monitoring the
project’s physical accomplishments (even if the mission found few traces of this), but has
failed to assess the impact and viability of these accomplishments, and therefore has not
provided the project’s monitoring authorities with the elements needed to reorient it. In
particular, the M&E system did not manage to detect the often artificial and precarious
nature of the results obtained in regard to property regularization, the durable
establishment of a viable agricultural credit institution, the quality or rehabilitation works,
economic profitability for the beneficiaries and the sustainability of diversification
activities.
xvi. The PDIAIM’s experience has also illustrated the difficulties of a coordination
unit functioning at the margins of the administration in coordinating the action of
different state services and encouraging the political orientations needed for reaching
project objectives. Despite its theoretical role as coordinator of the project as a whole, it
seems the UC-PDIAIM mainly managed activities that were directly under its
administrative supervision (institutional strengthening, incentive support, diversification)
and took on an essentially administrative function, without managing to organize the tight
coordination between all the implementation agencies concerned, as was recommended



20
     Connor et al. 2007, Mateos et al. 2010, Garcia-Bolanos et al. 2011, Comas et al.2012.


                                                  58
by almost all the supervision missions since the start of the project. Therefore, a great
number of recommendations by these supervision missions were never put into action.
Furthermore, whereas the formulation of the project had allowed for important progress
to be made in regard to policy governing the sector (liberalization of paddy rice trade,
lighter property securing procedures), the PDIAIM then failed to promote a significant
number of reforms and political orientations that would have contributed to better project
and general irrigation sector performance. This includes: the development of a policy to
support irrigated agriculture applied by all projects, the reform of the UNCACEM, the
extension of credit to double crops and diversification, a mechanization strategy, the
effective securing of access to property, particularly for women, seed policy, etc.
xvii. This study’s recommendations are twofold, in the short-term and in the medium-
term for programs to come. In the short-term, the following actions are recommended:
     a.   Balance in an equitable manner the credit situation of all perimeters having
          taken part in the PDIAIM, while particularly taking into account that similar
          projects implemented at the same time as the PDIAIM (PRPB, PGIRE, National
          Program) financed works and pumping and drainage means through subsidies 21;
     b.   Offer solutions to perimeters that are not developed due to a simple technical
          problem (lack of, or inadequate pumping means, lack of pipes, etc.);
     c.   Organize the transfer of conditioning and storage centers (in Rosso and
          Nouakchott airport) to consortiums of private operators, before they deteriorate
          any further;
     d.   Produce an assessment of the various engineering and design companies and
          contractors that worked on the project.
xviii. For the programs to come, the lessons learned from the assessment of the
PDIAIM point to the need for the following changes in the approach:
     a.   A much more participative and holistic approach towards communities’
          constraints, so as to increase their resilience to adverse events (in particularly
          focusing more on improved access, diversification, pumping and drainage
          means, improved seed, agricultural advice, intermediate mechanization, etc.);
     b.   Redefinition of structural planning norms in favor of a much more modest
          intervention in regard to rehabilitation, one limited to essential works and
          favoring quality, with a greater contribution from the beneficiaries in regard to
          secondary and tertiary networks and plots;
     c.   A limited and compact intervention for small perimeters (50 ha maximum),
          without complex works and long channels, thus allowing for management and
          maintenance that is accessible to the beneficiary communities;
     d.   An intervention that includes securing adequate and less expensive
          (electrification) pumping means and maintenance;


21
 This recommendation may however be rendered null and void by the decision made by the
Council of Ministers on 13 February 2014 to cancel the whole of agricultural debt.


                                            59
e.   A limited intervention in communities that have the leadership, organizational
     and managerial capacities needed for proper management and maintenance of
     the perimeter;
f.   Encouraging new farming systems that include intermediate mechanization and
     diversification;
g.   In regard to agricultural financing instruments, distinguishing between
     subsistence farming and agriculture with trade as an end with, in particular, for
     poor communities, limiting the use of credit to finance crops and using solely
     matching grants for structural planning, pumping and drainage means and other
     investments;
h.   Simplification of institutional setups for granting matching grants to a single
     agency;
i.   An end to state interventions prone to spread confusion between agricultural
     credit and subsidies;
j.   Simplification of credit granting procedures in order to reduce transaction
     expenses;
k.   Development of sector approaches on which the state may rely but not
     substitute itself to operators;
l.   Disengagement of the state in all sectors where its intervention impedes the
     growth of private operators or leads to their disappearance (agricultural
     mechanization, input supply, etc.);
m.   Long term support for research and popularization, including advice on
     management and organization;
n.   Generalization of property structure blueprints, clarification of the ambiguity
     between permanent concession and title deed and transfer of property to farmers
     based on the ongoing PPG 1 experience;
o.   An institutional setup guaranteeing full state involvement and support,
     particularly in regard to policies governing the sector (insofar as possible avoid
     setting up autonomous project units);
p.   The setup of M&E systems that actually analyze the viability and sustainability
     of interventions and provide supervising authorities with the elements allowing
     for a decision to reorient activities if necessary.

Annex 11. PDIAIM Additional Financing SAVS 22 Component
For the AF, no stakeholder workshop or beneficiary assessment was carried out.
However, an independent evaluation of the food security net Emel (Boutiques Emel and
Stocks Alimentaires Villageous de Securité (SAVS) was done. This evaluation was carried
out by Messrs. Limam Abdawa and Joel Hourticq, consultants from September 26 to
October 10, 2013. The executive summary of this evaluation is presented below.
                                EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
 1.     Within the framework of the PDIAIM II’s additional financing, the World Bank
 has contributed to the foodstuffs for human consumption component of the Emel (“hope”
 in Arabic) program launched by the Mauritanian government in 2012 to alleviate the
 effects of the 2011 drought on the most vulnerable populations. The World Bank
 financed the acquisition of 7,200 tons of wheat and its distribution amongst 1,070 SAVS.
 The cost of the World Bank’s operation amounted to $4 M, of which $3 M were spent
 on wheat purchase, $0.5 M on internal transport and $0.5 M on supervision. This
 operation, managed by the Commissariat à la Sécurité Alimentaire (CSA) 23, was part of
 a larger operation, co-financed by WFP, which allowed for the distribution of about
 18,000 tons of wheat to almost 2,600 SAVS in 2012 and 2013.
 2.     The SAVS started to be set up in rural areas within the framework of the WFP’s
 and Mauritanian government’s interventions in the early 2000s, with a peak in 2005-
 2006-2007. The principle is as follows: a given community receives a starting bank of
 wheat as a donation, which it sells at a reduced price to its most vulnerable members
 during the hunger gap; with the profits generated from the sales, the community amasses
 a bank for the village during harvesting season, which is used during the next hunger
 gap to alleviate the intra-annual price variations for the most vulnerable, and so on. The
 total number of SAVS was estimated to be around 3,800 at the end of 2011. Of these,
 very few (less than 3%) were considered to be functional 24 . Most of the SAVS
 replenished in 2012-2013 already existed; only around a hundred new SAVS were
 created in 2013 within the framework of the World Bank’s financing.
 3.     Regarding logistics, the operation took place in a satisfactory manner thanks to
 the CSA’s experience in the area. However, due to the slow pace of implementation
 procedures, distributions did not start before July 2013, even though the critical situation
 for beneficiary populations occurred during the 2012 hunger gap (May-June-July-
 August 2012). Furthermore, the slow pace of disbursements forced the CSA to pre-
 finance the operation in part, and some transporters remain unpaid to this day, which has
 disrupted the CSA’s later operations, with the affected transporters refusing to take part
 in other operations before having been paid.

4.     It must also be noted that the operation’s initial target was not reached: the 7,200
tons of wheat were originally supposed to benefit 705 communities (or 10.2 tons per
SAVS on average) and equal the predicted needs of the most vulnerable part of the
population during the hunger gap. Administrative authorities then decided to increase
the number of beneficiary SAVS to 1,070 (or 6.7 tons per SAVS on average), which
lead to a real disconnection between the quantity of wheat provided and the emergency
needs of the communities.
5.     A World Bank team conducted an assessment of the foodstuffs for human
consumption component of the Emel program, including the SAVS operation, in
September and October of 2013 (see Assessment Document below). This assessment
concluded that the SAVS supported by WFP and World Bank financing in 2012 and
2013 still suffered from the same shortfalls outlined in the CSA/WFP 2011 study, that is
to say that the great majority of beneficiary communities received this support as
emergency aid (that could be renewed if need be) and not as the setting up of a tool that
could potentially increase their resilience. As noted during previous similar operations,
most replenished SAVS in 2012 and 2013 only served as a self-targeting tool by
communities for the distribution of subsidized goods during the hunger gap. Most of
these SAVS have not developed replenishment strategies for the following harvest, or
even, in many cases, understood that the purpose of this instrument was to set up a long-
term village bank in order to even out prices for the most vulnerable. Five factors
obviously contributed to this flawed perception:
  •   Communication, training and monitoring actions meant to accompany the SAVS’
      replenishment were clearly insufficient;
  •   More particularly, possible strategies for the autonomous replenishment of SAVS
      during later rotations were not studied with enough focus; these strategies should
      probably differ depending on the area (with replenishments normally being easier
      in areas of agricultural production or areas close to important markets, where
      SAVS can benefit from easier access to larger reserves and a pronounced
      fluctuation of prices between harvestings and hunger gaps, and replenishments
      being more problematic elsewhere);
  •   The lack of a legal status for SAVS has contributed to the perception that their
      purpose is purely temporary and has prevented notions of responsibility and
      accountability in terms of results or in cases of misappropriation;
  •   Undersized operations compared to the needs of the most vulnerable, as
      mentioned above, have led to diminished interest from beneficiary communities;
  •   Finally, the fact that the initial provision was made in wheat during the hunger
      gap on one hand largely contributed to the general perception that the SAVS were
      an emergency distribution system and, on the other, led to the immediate halving
      of their circulating capital, with communities pushed to sell this initial wheat
      endowment at the same price as the Emel stores, therefore at approximately half
      the market price. The idea of providing circulating capital in the form of cash
      resources during the harvesting period could be explored.
