The\n            main project objectives were to: (a) gradually build the\n            organizational technical and financial capacities of the\n            municipalities of Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso to enable\n            them to assume responsibility for contracting the\n            maintenance of urban infrastructure and the supply of urban\n            services, and cope with a rapidly growing urban population;\n            and (b) improve the infrastructure of these two cities to an\n            acceptable level so that effective routine maintenance can\n            be provided. The project achieved, and in some cases\n            exceeded, its objectives, both in terms of institutional\n            aspects and physical objectives. The Bank's performance\n            was satisfactory. Staff continuity during supervision was\n            satisfactory. The Borrower's performance was\n            satisfactory overall, although deficient during project\n            start-up. The key lesson to be drawn from this project is\n            that for an urban investment program to be successful it\n            must have the support of its principal partners, namely the\n            municipalities. Other lessons learned are: (i) coordination\n            between local partners is essential to implement\n            institutional reforms in the urban sector; (ii) the\n            Government must develop cooperation with and among donors,\n            especially for the decentralization of urban services and\n            infrastructure; (iii) continuity of projects must be ensured\n            to secure sector reforms; (iv) overly complex operational\n            arrangements, involving several implementing agencies, and\n            potential conflicts in jurisdiction, should be avoided; and\n            (v) simple disbursement procedures should be adopted."}, "docdt": "1996-02-15T00:00:00Z"}
