the Policy Framework Paper for 1991-93 and\n            focuses on implementation in two key areas: public resource\n            management and private sector incentives. The private sector\n            incentives component addresses public enterprise sector\n            restructuring, banking sector restructuring, and trade and\n            regulatory reform. The public sector resource management\n            component includes restructuring recurrent budget\n            expenditure to support human resource development,\n            preparation of a civil service management reform, and\n            improved investment programming. Specific actions include\n            elimination of quantitative restrictions on imports,\n            simplification of import procedures, price liberalization,\n            reform of the legal and regulatory framework for both the\n            public and private enterprise sectors, reduction in labor\n            market regulations, reduction in the relative size of the\n            wage bill in the government budget, increased budget\n            allocations for expenditure on health, education and routine\n            road maintenance, and strengthening budgetary control and\n            public investment programming."}, "docdt": "1991-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
