         Development Project aims to: (a) improve social outcomes and\n            promote economic growth by strengthening social services\n            delivery (education, health and nutrition services) for the\n            population; (b) reduce poverty and promote regional equity\n            by strengthening social service delivery and increasing\n            economic opportunities in atolls remote from the prosperous\n            Male region; and (c) promote ecologically sustainable\n            development by concentrating services and populations on\n            ecologically viable islands within these atolls. There are\n            four project components along with project management and\n            evaluation. Component 1 strengthens education service\n            delivery. This project component will support: (a) enhancing\n            cost-effective access to secondary education, (b) improving\n            the quality of education on focus islands, and (c)\n            conducting whole school evaluations including assessments.\n            Component 2 strengthens health service delivery. The project\n            component supports (a) rationalizing care for\n            non-communicable diseases (NCDs), (b) enhancing support for\n            nutrition promotion to address the widespread problem of\n            childhood malnutrition through communication of strategic\n            behavioral changes, improved nutrition surveillance, and\n            greater use of locally relevant complementary foods.\n            Component 3 strengthens employment services. It will enhance\n            employment prospects of individuals, particularly those\n            residing in remote atolls by (a) supporting cost effective\n            job information and job counseling services through a\n            national jobs information network, job centers on focus\n            islands, career and employment counseling through job\n            centers and business centers to facilitate business\n            development; and (b) expanding existing mircrofinance\n            programs. Component 4 strengthens community services. The\n            project will improve service delivery by strengthening\n            community services. Component 5 supports the project\n            monitoring and evaluation framework."}, "docdt": "2004-05-28T00:00:00Z"}
