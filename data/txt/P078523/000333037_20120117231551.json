"Ratings for the Integrated Human\n            Development Project for Maldives were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the most effective way to improve services in island\n            economies is to develop ownership and accountability at the\n            community level. Procurement training and capacity building\n            for implementing agencies would need to pay more attention\n            to the contract management aspects of procurement. All\n            actors, including Ministries of Finance, need to be on board\n            to successfully manage contracts. Projects should not rely\n            extensively on human resources that are to be trained during\n            the project for purposes of project implementation. Where\n            staff of implementing agencies needs to be trained, on-the\n            job training with the help of consultant trainers may work\n            better than deputing a large number of staff frequently or\n            on long training programs during the project period.\n            Further, genuine decentralization or transfer of authority\n            with accountability is required to effectively address the\n            issue of ownership by subordinate implementing agencies. An\n            important corollary is that small or medium size civil works\n            located on remote islands should be managed and supervised\n            by island level leadership or management. Island communities\n            have successfully managed a wide variety of civil works, can\n            provide close supervision, direct small but important design\n            changes and ensure the accountability of the contractor. For\n            large works, a tandem arrangement, with<BR>initial\n            design and bidding responsibilities at the central level,\n            but supervision and payment authorization at the island\n            level, may work better than management through an external\n            contractor, who has no accountability at the island level.\n            The lack of authority at the local level also meant that the\n            islands looked to the center to fix even the smallest of\n            problems and repairs."}, "docdt": "2011-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
