The proposed restructuring involves\n            changing the project objectives so that they are measurable\n            in line with the requirements of IDA 14. The proposed\n            changes will not affect the project components nor the\n            activities financed by the project. The changes also better\n            reflect the evolving situation in the Maldives which was hit\n            by the Tsunami on December 26,2004. The new objectives of\n            the project are to assist the borrower in improving the\n            delivery of social services on Focus Islands. Two of the\n            eight performance indicators will be dropped because it is\n            difficult to establish a baseline for these and thus they\n            are not in line with the IDA 14 guidelines. The proposed\n            changes will have little effect on the project as appraised.\n            The one activity that has been dropped will be a\n            contribution to an UNDP supported micro-finance program,"}, "docdt": "2006-12-06T00:00:00Z"}
