"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The project development objectives are\n            to improve social services, contain the rise in public\n            services unit costs, and promote economic opportunities on\n            selected, ecologically viable focus islands in four atolls.\n            The focus island development strategy is part of a new\n            Government strategy to improve the quality and\n            cost-effectiveness of service delivery outside of the Male\n            region, focusing investments on islands which are\n            ecologically sustainable and can, in the long run, develop\n            into centers offering an alternative to the capital region\n            for access to services,  and economic opportunities. The\n            Project does not require a full environmental assessment,\n            given the nature and scale of project activities, and, it is\n            classified as a category B. Screening and assessment show\n            these activities are likely to have minimal adverse\n            environmental impacts, and, would not involve conversion, or\n            degradation of critical natural habitats, or other natural\n            habitats nor cultural property. However, some activities\n            may, unless careful project design and implementation is\n            undertaken, potentially have specific impacts of low\n            significance. These are site specific impacts due to\n            construction waste; improper disposal of health care waste;\n            and, improper solid waste and sewerage disposal. Mitigation\n            measures should minimize identified potential impacts\n            through: due care of site selection, taking into account the\n            fragile and vulnerable island ecosystems, including\n            groundwater hydrology, coral reefs, and enclosed lagoons.\n            Moreover, potential impacts on threatened or endangered\n            species should be mitigated; and, dewatering activities\n            should be implemented in accordance to the Water Authority\n            regulations, while liquid effluents must be discharges via\n            maritime outfalls. Discharge points shall be established\n            through wastewater discharge permits  granted by the\n            relevant authorities. Each health care facility must\n            establish a Health Care Waste Management Plan, appropriate\n            to the scale and type of activities, and identified hazards."}, "docdt": "2004-05-04T00:00:00Z"}
