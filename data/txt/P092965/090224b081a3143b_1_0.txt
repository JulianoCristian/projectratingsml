                         The project's long-term development objectives are to: (a) significantly increase the coverage and use of relevant ICT services among the rural population through an
                         incentive program designed to encourage the participation of private operators in the rural segment of the ICT market; and (b) increase private sector participation in the
                         delivery of e-Government services, thereby improving public sector utilization of ICT.

                         have not been implemented. The project has achieved all but one of the PDO Indicators and most of the Intermediate Results Indicators. As a result of the project, mobile voice and
                         data services are currently available in all soum centers in Mongolia (90 directly supported by the project); over 150 rural herder communities gained access to public telephony
                         service at the bagh level; 34 soum centers have broadband Internet access for public and private users including schools connected at discounted rates; and a modern spectrum
