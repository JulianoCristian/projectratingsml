                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project's closing date was extended (for the first time) to March 31, 2013. The primary reason for the extension was to allow for the implementation of the two e-Government
                         applications to be completed. Along with the extension of the closing date, a reallocation of proceeds was also processed.
