The\n            closing date for grants is proposed to be extended by one\n            year from March 31, 2012 until March 31, 2013 in order to\n            allow for the implementation of the two e-Government\n            applications (Public Key Infrastructure and Certification\n            Authority, or PKI & CA and Portal System) to be\n            completed within the proposed extended closing date in line\n            with the actions agreed with the Government of Mongolia.\n            This extension will have no effect on the achievement of the\n            original project results other than the time delay. This\n            will be the first extension of the project. The extension\n            meets the criteria of OP 13.30, i.e., (a) the project\n            objectives continue to be achievable; (b) the performance of\n            the borrower and project implementing agencies is\n            satisfactory; and (c) the borrower has agreed a specific\n            action plan with the World Bank to complete the project."}, "docdt": "2012-03-21T00:00:00Z"}
