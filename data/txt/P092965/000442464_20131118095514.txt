F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project's long-term development objectives are to: (a) significantly increase the
coverage and use of relevant ICT services among the rural population through an
incentive program designed to encourage the participation of private operators in the rural
segment of the ICT market; and (b) increase private sector participation in the delivery of
e-Government services, thereby improving public sector utilization of ICT.

1. PROJECT CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN

1.1. Context at Appraisal

1.1.1 Country background. Mongolia is divided into 21 provinces (aimags), 342 soums
and districts (urban and rural divisions), and 1,681 baghs and horoos (urban and rural
communes). With a population density of only about two people per square kilometer,
Mongolia is one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world. In addition, a
significant share of the country’s 2.8 million citizens leads a nomadic lifestyle as herders,
while the rest reside in villages, towns, and cities.

1.1.2 Over the past 20 years, Mongolia has transformed itself from a socialist country to a
vibrant multiparty democracy with a booming economy. The Government has been focusing
on improving economic competitiveness and productivity through attracting investments and
reducing the economic and social isolation of the rural population. Driven by the exploitation
of its vast mineral resources, the economy grew by 12.4 percent in 2012, compared to 6.4
percent GDP growth in 2010. GDP is expected to continue to grow at a double digit rate over
the period from 2013 to 2017. This economic growth has translated into some benefits for
the people of Mongolia. Poverty has been on a downward trend, having decreased from 39
percent in 2010 to 27 percent in 2012. But economic growth has also led to an increase in
disparities, at the household and regional levels. There is a widening gap between urban and
rural areas in terms of access to income and services.

1.1.3 Increased economic prosperity has led to an increased demand for information and
communication technologies (ICT) with the market growing at a compound annual rate above
25 percent in the early 2000s. At the end of December 2005, total fixed and mobile
teledensity reached approximately 26 percent, up from 13 percent in 2001. 1 However,
Mongolia presented unique challenges to the further development of ICTs. As a sparsely
populated country with almost half the population clustered in the capital of Ulanbaatar and a
significant portion of the population living a nomadic lifestyle, it had been difficult for ICT
companies to provide access to services outside of main population centers and make
headway into rural Mongolian society illustrated by a 1 percent teledensity in rural areas in
2005.

1.2. Sector Context

1.2.1 Recognizing the potential of ICT infrastructure, applications, and services to enhance
competitiveness, productivity, and the efficiency of institutions, the Government of Mongolia
(GoM) began implementing since the mid-1990s a comprehensive telecommunications sector
reform program. This led to effective liberalization of all market segments, partial
privatization of the fixed line incumbent, Mongolia Telecom Company (MTC), and
establishment of the Communications Regulation Commission (CRC) as an independent
regulatory authority. The regulatory environment also evolved with the inception of
interconnection, tariff, and licensing regimes conducive to competition. As a result, the

telecommunications sector received considerable foreign investments and witnessed
tremendous growth.

1.2.2 During this period, GoM developed a framework and strategy for universal access to
telecommunications services and for the use of the universal service obligations fund (USOF)
to support the strategy. The USOF itself was established with the purpose of accumulating
and disbursing funds for the construction of new networks, expanding or renovating existing
networks, and to provide services to remote areas and to populations without access. The
focus was on achieving an appropriate and self-sustainable level of access to telephony and
public internet/information services in all underserved areas, particularly rural soums that are
unlikely to see sufficient private investment without intervention in the form of financial
support.

1.2.3 Through implementation of the Government’s E-Mongolia strategy (2005), the
government intended to establish the foundation of a knowledge-based, information society
in Mongolia by enhancing extensive application of ICT in all sectors. Some of the main
strategic directions of the E-Mongolia strategy were the:

   •   establishment of an improved legal and policy environment for ICT development,
   •   creation of adequate and quality information and communications infrastructure,
   •   use of ICT in government to build a citizen-centered and results-oriented government.

1.2.4 But despite the initial successes reaped in the ICT sector, GoM faced a number of
challenges towards achieving its development objectives stated under the E-Mongolia
strategy. These included:

   •   Huge disparity in the availability of ICT infrastructure and services between the rural
       and urban areas of Mongolia. For example, in 2006, over 80 percent of existing
       phones and Internet users were in Ulanbaatar and other commercial areas.
       Teledensity in rural areas stood at about 1 percent. Virtually no services existed
       outside of the soum centers, at the bagh level, where the vast majority of residents are
       seasonally nomadic.

   •   Inadequate capacity to proactively regulate and promote the development and
       implementation of a growing ICT sector agenda. With the implementation of the first
       phase of sector reforms, CRC, the regulator, needed to build institutional capacity to
       consolidate reforms, further promote competition, and address convergence in the ICT
       sector. However, CRC lacked the capacity or resources to do so. While regulations
       had been established to deal with a number of critical issues, including licensing,
       interconnection, tariffs, long-distance, and management of limited resources such as
       numbers and radio spectrum, CRC had to take steps to improve the regulatory
       environment in this area as well as enhance competition in the sector.

   •   High cost of service provision and challenges of attracting private investments in
       rural Mongolia. Given the country’s vast and challenging geography, the cost of
       providing rural communications infrastructure was very high and ensuring access
       difficult and challenging. While MTC is responsible for provision of rural services, it
       had limited resources and capacity to implement the rollout of rural services in a
       timely and efficient manner. On the other hand, private operators are not mandated to


                                              -2-
        provide services in rural Mongolia and had been unwilling to expand services in areas
        that are commercially unviable, without support of capital investments from GoM.

    •   Limited ICT policy leadership, implementation capacity, and resources in the
        government to deliver on its ICT vision and related action plan. While the GoM had
        an ambitious ICT policy agenda, the institutional arrangements (such as funding,
        coordination capacity, human capacity and skills) for delivering a comprehensive
        program in this sector were weak. Despite the announcement of an e-Government
        master plan, Mongolia lacked many of the key enablers of e-Government such as
        infrastructure, interoperability frameworks, standards, and an adequate legal and
        regulatory framework. In addition, Mongolia had a fledgling albeit growing private
        sector with limited capabilities and resources to fully participate in the country’s ICT
        growth potential.

1.3. Rationale for Bank Involvement

1.3.1 The project was deemed consistent with the FY05-FY08 CAS 2 core strategic
objectives of: (a) consolidating the transition to a market economy by improving the
regulatory and legal environment for increasing private sector participation in the provision
of infrastructure; and (b) reducing rural vulnerabilities by supporting new approaches to
improve the environment for local economic growth. The project aimed to support the latter
objective by improving the country’s ICT infrastructure and thereby reducing Mongolia’s
characteristic remoteness and creating new opportunities for its rural people. The project was
also aligned with the government’s Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction strategy.

1.3.2 Further, World Bank support was deemed vital to: (a) leveraging increased private
investments in the sector, and establishing a robust and transparent approach for public-
private partnerships (PPP) in the provision of rural infrastructure access; and (b) providing
resources to finance the design and implementation of key ICT policy and regulatory
priorities that would foster private sector led growth in the sector and improve public sector
use of ICTs.

1.4. Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators

1.4.1 The project's long-term project development objectives (PDO) were to:
(a) significantly increase the coverage and use of relevant ICT services among the rural
population through an incentive program designed to encourage the participation of private
operators in the rural segment of the ICT market; and (b) increase private sector participation
in the delivery of e-Government services, thereby improving public sector use of ICT.

       •    Through extension of basic telephony services 3 into about 350 to 400 rural herder
            communities at the bagh level outside of soum centers that did not have access to
            telecommunications and information services, the project envisaged benefitting at
            least 45,000 people living in rural herder communities.
       •    By increasing the number of soum centers with access to digital telephony and
            internet services, along with providing institutions such as schools with access to
            internet, the project aimed at delivering digital telephony and internet services to users
            (citizens, private enterprises, and public sector entities) living and/or based in about
            45 soum centers.

           institutions (such as CRC and ICTPA), and e-government applications, the project
           would stand to benefit the entire population of Mongolia.

1.6.2      Revised: None

1.7       Original Components


1.7.1 The project had three main interrelated components aimed at achieving the project
development objective:

      (a) Component 1: Information and Communications Infrastructure Development in
          Rural Areas ($ 7.04 million inclusive of taxes and duties) to support the
          implementation of the GoM’s universal access strategy in order to accelerate the
          provision of telephony and Internet services in rural Mongolia. In particular, service
          providers were to be awarded “least-cost’’ capital subsidies to provide public
          telephony services at the bagh level; and telephony and Internet services at the soum
          level, including Internet services for strategic vanguard institutions such as schools.
          Specific subcomponents were: (a) capital subsidy support to provide telephony
          services at the bagh level (for herder communities); (b) capital subsidy support to
          provide telephony and Internet services for soum centers; and (c) technical assistance
          support for consultant services to design the bidding documents for the OBA schemes
          (described above), and to manage the implementation of these programs.

      (b) Component 2: Communications Regulatory Development ($2.01 million
          inclusive of taxes and duties) was aimed at providing investment support and
          technical assistance to strengthen the sector regulator, CRC. Specific subcomponents
          were: (a) financing a radio spectrum management and monitoring system;
          (b) technical assistance support to finance the preparation of bidding documents for
          the radio spectrum management and monitoring system; (c) technical assistance to
          CRC in the areas of licensing, spectrum policy, monitoring of the implementation of
          the universal access program, and specialized regulatory advice; and (d) training for
          staff in areas such as regulation of competition, public consultative processes,
          interconnection, price regulation, resolution of disputes, consumer rights and
          complaints, accounting for costs and new trends in regulation.

      (c) Component 3: Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) for e-Government ($2.46
          million inclusive of taxes and duties) to address gaps in the enabling environment
          for use of PPPs for provision of e-Government services and to roll-out e-Government
          applications using PPPs. Specific subcomponents were: (a) technical assistance for
          developing the policy, legal and regulatory frameworks for PPPs in e-Government;
          (b) consultancy services for conducting a detailed feasibility study to identify PPP
          project opportunities for e-Government, rank order them and develop requests for
          proposals (RfPs) to roll-out those applications with the most potential; (c) technical
          assistance for developing a project in the area of e-Government; (d) investment
          support for government’s participation in implementing priority e-Government
          project(s) in partnership with the private sector; (e) technical assistance for
          developing an information security framework; and (f) training of ICTA staff and
          Chief Information Officers (CIOs) of government ministries, agencies and

                                               -5-
        aimags/soums to deal with e-Government issues and to help them use PPPs to
        leverage funds from the private sector for the provision of e-Government services.

    (d) Component 4: Project Management ($ 0.35 million inclusive of taxes and duties)
        for providing support to cover the operating costs of the Project Implementation Unit
        (PIU) that had managed the project.

1.7.2   Revised components. Components were not revised.

1.8. Other significant changes

1.8.1 Detailed design of the universal access component. Based on the results of the rural
access pilot, developments in the telecommunications sector (rapid expansion of mobile
coverage to rural areas in particular), and feedback from the telecommunications operators,
the detailed design of the universal access component was revised in June 2007. It was
decided that separate subsidy competitions will be held for voice telephony and Internet
services in soum centers and the available financing was reallocated within the component.

1.8.2 The reallocation of proceeds from ‘unallocated’ and categories that would not
require full use due to savings to categories that were overdrawn of the IDA grant H232 was
requested by GoM in a letter dated April 6, 2011. Several categories were overdrawn due to
higher than estimated cost of the spectrum monitoring and management system (SMMS),
unexpected costs associated with the necessity to move the site of the fixed monitoring
station, unusually high bank fees for the irrevocable confirmed documentary credit for
SMMS, and higher than expected cost of goods and incremental operating costs.

one year from March 31, 2012 until March 31, 2013 to allow for the implementation of the
two e-Government applications (Public Key Infrastructure and Certification Authority and
Portal System) to be completed within the extended closing date. This extension had no
effect on the achievement of the original project results other than the time delay.

1.8.4 After the elections in mid-2012, the new GoM decided against the continued
implementation of the two e-Government applications (Public Key Infrastructure and
Certification Authority and Portal System) under the project. Subsequently, GoM
requested the cancellation of the uncommitted funds of special drawing rights (SDR) 842,000
allocated for this subcomponent in a letter dated March 27, 2013. This cancellation was
processed on March 29, 2013 effective March 27, 2013.


2. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1 Soundness of background analysis. The proposed project was consistent with the
CAS core strategic objectives of: (a) consolidating the transition to a market economy by
improving the regulatory and legal environment for increasing private sector participation in
the provision of infrastructure; and (b) reducing rural vulnerabilities by supporting new
approaches to improve the environment for local economic growth. The latter is achieved by
improving the country’s ICT infrastructure and thereby reducing Mongolia’s characteristic
remoteness and creating new opportunities for its rural people. Drawing upon lessons learned
from three Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid (GPOBA) financed pilot universal access
projects implemented prior in Mongolia, the project was also consistent with GoM’s own ICT
Vision for 2010, its e-Government Master Plan of 2005, and also earlier donor assistance in
the telecom sector. The output based aid (OBA) approach enabled use of the right incentive
framework to delineate the role of the public and private sectors. Reliance on private sector
operators for service provision through a competitive bidding process that minimized the
subsidy for up front capital expenditures was found to be an effective approach for serving
remote and poor areas.

2.1.2 Assessment of project design. The project design was kept simple and adapted to the
limited government capacity, primarily as a telecommunications infrastructure project
implemented through public/private partnerships. Complex business systems design and
major business process changes were avoided. Finally, the implementation schedule was
kept realistic and there was intensive supervision in the first year (at a cost of some $250,000)
which enabled the ‘hand holding’ needed at the initial stages. 4 Project financing involved an
IDA grant of SDR 5.563 million ($8.0 million equivalent at the time of negotiations), a
Government of Japan-financed Policy and Human Resources Development Fund (PHRD) co-
financing grant of $2.0 million, and a GoM contribution of $1.85 million. The Bank budget
preparation costs were relatively modest at some $120,000. The outcome indicators focused
on quantifiable results for which the project could reasonably be held accountable.

2.1.3 Adequacy of GoM’s commitment. Preparation of the project involved extensive
consultation with various concerned government agencies and received strong government
commitment. GoM’s ownership of the project was partly through the ICT Vision 2010 paper,
the e-government Master Plan and the participation in the design of the OBA approach for
rural access. There was also clear assignment of responsibilities by Government among its
various agencies. The GoM also exhibited its commitment by co-financing an amount of
$1.85 million, representing over 15 percent of total project costs. This demonstrates the
importance of this project for the Government as it was very rare for GoM to contribute to
project costs at that time. An inter-agency/ministry steering committee and an adequately
staffed PIU were also established before project launch. The PIU was responsible for
monitoring and evaluation, reporting to the Project Steering Committee, GoM, and the World
Bank. The only shortcoming noted was that staff of this new client was neither familiar with
nor trained in Bank procedures at the beginning of implementation, which delayed start up.

2.1.4 Assessment of risk at appraisal. Specific critical risks were identified, of which that
involving weak institutional capacity of policy and regulatory entities was rated substantial.
Mitigation measures including capacity building to strengthen CRC and ICTA’s institutional
capabilities; use of consultants to assist in the development of various policy and regulatory
toolkits and assist in the bid specifications for the rural access tenders; development of in-
house capacity to address policy and regulatory issues and administer the USOF; and setting-
up of a PIU for management and coordination support were integrated into the project design
and monitoring plans. But overall, the project was assigned risk rating of ‘Modest’ in view of
the following: The objectives were modest in terms of scope- namely, expansion of
telecommunications and internet services, and policies to encourage public private
partnerships (PPP). For a country with a challenging geography and a highly dispersed
population, the DOs were found to be relevant as the largest component focused on rural
access, particularly on smaller population centers. The reliance on PPP also minimized the
reliance on government institutions which, as mentioned, have limited capacity.

2.2   Implementation

Implementation Review and GoM performance.

2.2.1 The project was implemented successfully, for the most part, in that it had achieved
(and in many instances surpassed) its original outcome indicator targets, most significantly in
the area of telecom access at the soum and bagh levels as summarized in Annex 2. The
borrower was fairly effective in resolving implementation issues, although there were not
many of them. A shortcoming noted during implementation was delays in collection of some
of the data needed for M&E, due to nonavailability of some baseline data and difficulties in
obtaining information from private operators. But this improved over the course of the
project.

2.2.2 The government agencies concerned were able to keep implementation proceeding on
track, except for the e-government subcomponent, with the largest component for rural access
having surpassed its anticipated outcomes. Consultations with the private sector and other
stakeholders became more transparent and inclusive over the project period (concerns of
corruption/cronyism within government agencies had traditionally hindered private-sector
collaboration). Finally the ICT project’s PPP framework was used by the GoM to enact a law
embodying this PPP concept for all sectors, which is a valuable contribution. Overall,
implementation progressed on track with disbursements only slightly behind the original

                                             -8-
schedule. By March 21, 2012, $7.14 million (SDR 4.64 million) had been disbursed from the
IDA grant, representing over 83 percent of the IDA grant proceeds, and $1.68 million had
been disbursed from the PHRD grant, representing over 83 percent of the PHRD grant
proceeds.

Restructuring and Extension of Closing Date

2.2.3 As noted in 1.8.1 and 1.8.2, the reallocation of proceeds of the IDA grant H232 was
requested by GoM from ‘Unallocated’ and categories that would not require full use due to
savings to categories that were overdrawn. Several categories were overdrawn due to higher
than estimated cost of the SMMS, unexpected costs associated with the necessity to move the
site of the fixed monitoring station, unusually high bank fees for the irrevocable confirmed
documentary credit for SMMS, and higher than expected cost of goods and incremental
operating costs. The closing date for Grants No. H232 and TF 56536 were extended by one
year from March 31, 2012 until March 31, 2013 in order to allow for the implementation of
the two e-Government applications (Public Key Infrastructure and Certification Authority
and Portal System and Portal System) to be completed within the extended closing date. See
below for an explanation on the reasons behind the delay in implementing E-Government
applications.

2.2.4 “Cannibalization” of the herder network. The project design didn't foresee the rapid
expansion of mobile networks, which led to curtailment of the herder network (a satellite
based network providing basic telephony services to rural herder communities at the bagh
level outside of soum centers) expansion. This phenomenon is not without precedent as the
development of mobile networks, due to technology development and competition, has
surpassed even the most optimistic forecasts in most of the world. In 2006, the rapid
expansion of mobile networks which brought mobile coverage to all soums before the end of
2008, in a country with the world's lowest population density, was not anticipated, given that
only about 100 out of the 330 rural soums had mobile coverage in 2006. This made the
herder network obsolete in many areas and made it suitable only as for deep rural areas.
Ultimately, however, the herders received a superior service.

2.2.5 Inability to develop E-Government applications. While the project has contributed to
the increase in private sector participation in the delivery of e-Government services, the two
targeted e-Government applications (Public Key Infrastructure and Certification Authority;
and Citizen Internet and Government Administrative Intranet Portals and Virtual Private
Network) could not be implemented. The project design acknowledged risks and foresaw the
potential problems in this direction, and therefore applied only 10 percent of the funding to
try something new with potentially high benefits.

2.2.6   The reasons for inability to develop the E-Government applications are twofold:

   (a) Since these two applications were to be implemented as PPP, this approach was new
       for the Government and it took some time to finalize the PPP model to apply as well
       as to develop the bidding documents.

   (b) After the elections in 2012, the new Government decided against the continued
       implementation of these applications under the project (although contracts for the
       implementation of both applications had been awarded). Therefore, the earlier
       considered second extension of the closing date to allow for the implementation of

                                             -9-
        these e-Government applications was not processed. Consequently, the IDA funds
        allocated to them (SDR 842,000) were canceled before project closing and reallocated
        to Mongolia's IDA16 allocation.

future projects are identified in Table 3.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation and Use

2.3.1 Arrangements for monitoring and evaluation (M&E) were overall adequate. The PIU
was responsible for monitoring and evaluation, reporting to the Project Steering Committee,
GoM, and the World Bank. PIU was stipulated to carry-out monitoring and reviewing the
project performance every six months and provide semi-annual report no later than January
31 and July 31 of the subsequent half-year. The capacity to collect and analyze data was
supported by resources from the project. While there were delays in collection of some data

                                                - 11 -
due to difficulties in obtaining information from private operators in areas not supported by
the project, attempts were made to reduce the burden of data provision by private operators.

2.3.2 M&E use. The M&E framework was useful in monitoring implementation progress,
signaling issues and prompting the client and the Bank to make adjustments to enhance the
project’s ability to realize its objectives. Data was gathered on the growth of mobile
networks, and based upon this, funding was diverted from herder network (which is an
inferior service) to mobile network, which is a superior service. This led to an increased
number of soum centers to be provided with telecom infrastructure, than originally planned.

2.4   Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Environment. The project was classified as Category “C,” and was thereby not
expected to and did not pose significant environmental impacts. As an example of
environmental mainstreaming within the project, small satellite terminals provided to herder
communities for network services can be moved when herders move to new grazing grounds.

2.4.2 Procurement was organized and carried out by the PIU with oversight from the
Steering Committee. Procurement of goods was carried out on the basis of international
competitive bidding, shopping and direct contracting. The Bank’s oversight included prior
and post reviews of procurement and contracting procedures to ascertain that the Procurement
Guidelines were followed and the activities were in compliance with the legal documents.
There were no major policy or institutional issues to be resolved as none had come up during
project implementation. Several key capacity constraints identified at inception were
resolved by the Borrower or were improved markedly over time, particularly because of the
mitigating measures that were introduced, which included, most saliently, the comprehensive
capacity building program to strengthen CRC and ICTA’s institutional capabilities in this
regard. Various toolkits and new regulatory policies were introduced while ensuring that bid
documents were properly designed and contained appropriate specifications and evaluation
criteria. International consultants were provided through the Japanese grant trust fund to
advise and assist on procurement related issues.

2.4.3 The effectiveness of some procurement actions remained an issue affecting the
timeliness and orderly implementation of the project, but this over time also improved. The
midterm review pointed out that: “the project implementation has made good progress
(around 65 percent of the available funds have been disbursed and about 75 percent of the
available amount has been committed). Most of the packages have been effectively
committed.” No fraud and corruption issues were uncovered or reported during
implementation. Despite procurement risk rated as ‘high’ at appraisal (on account of client’s
limited capacity and experience with World Bank procurement policies), overall procurement
experience was smooth with all of the procurement activities under the project completed.
Consecutive ISRs point to a steady improvement in the procurement process. This may
partially also be attributed to the fact that over the course of the project’s implementation
GoM had improved its public financial management, adopted new anti-corruption legislation,
and collected/ published asset and income disclosures for top officials.

2.4.4 Financial management. The PIU maintained dedicated accounts for the project and
prepared financial statements on a regular basis. Annual audit reports were submitted to the
Bank on time and no significant issues had been identified. It was noted that expenditures
were properly supported by adequate documents, approved by authorized persons and

                                            - 12 -
recorded into the project accounts accurately and timely. Supervision reports noted no
shortage or delay of funds hindering fund flow or disbursement. The financial management
arrangements were strengthened by separate monitoring of implementation of the main
output-based components, comprising about two-thirds of project expenditures, through a
technical audit undertaken by an independent verification agent. It was concluded that the
project’s financial management system was adequate and proceeds of the funds were used for
their intended purposes.

2.4.5 Social aspects. The project was designed to contribute to reducing the 'friction of
distance' and economic and social isolation of those living in rural Mongolia, and as such was
in sync with GoM’s strategy to promote inclusive growth. Particular attention was paid to
meeting the needs of remote and seasonally nomadic herding communities, which account for
a significant share of those in Mongolia living below the poverty line. In addition, the
promotion of e-Government services as part of the project was intended to contribute to
improving public access to information in remote rural communities and thereby enhancing
transparency and accountability in public service provision.

2.5   Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1 The rural access component of this project does not impose any additional future
financing requirements on the government as it was based on an OBA approach where a one-
time subsidy by the government is awarded to the operator in return for a commitment to
provide the ICT services to the population. The rural access component of the project was
designed to be sustainable based on the pre-feasibility studies carried out by GoM which
estimated an internal rate of return (IRR) of 25 percent. The operators that were awarded the
rural access contracts knew that their operation must be commercially sustainable after the
initial subsidy from the government. In addition, the establishment and operationalization of
the USOF created a mechanism for financing the major future telecommunications and ICT
infrastructure needs of rural Mongolia, barring unforeseen developments or needs.

2.5.2 The project was designed to be fully self-sustainable at completion. As a result of this
project, regulatory staff received training aimed at increased capacity of staff and
effectiveness of government processes. Furthermore, as sector revenues increase, the amount
of revenues collected by the regulator from the operators has increased. Today, the sector
regulator CRC is fully self-financed. CRC has its own income from sector fees, which it uses
for its ongoing operations, capacity building, and investments in regulatory tools (including
co-financing of the radio spectrum management and monitoring system implemented under
the project).

2.5.3 The subcomponent on PPP approach for e-Government applications was cancelled.
After the elections in mid-2012, the new GoM decided against the continued implementation
of the two e-Government services under the project implement these using its own sources.


3. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

3.1   Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

Rating: Highly Satisfactory



                                            - 13 -
3.1.1. The relevance of the project objectives, design and implementation remains high. The
project is consistent with the current CAS 5 core strategic objectives of: (a) consolidating the
transition to a market economy by improving the regulatory and legal environment for
increasing private sector participation in the provision of infrastructure; and (b) reducing rural
vulnerabilities by supporting new approaches to improve the environment for local economic
growth. The objectives are fully aligned with GoM’s e-Government Master Plan of 2005
(which emphasizes improved regulatory environment for ICT development; ICT-enabled
Government for citizen-focused services; and improved ICT infrastructure), GoM’s ICT
Vision for 2010 (providing a blueprint for the development of ICT in Mongolia), as well as
with GoM’s 2021 ICT vision. By enhancing rural productivity and competitiveness (and
thereby spurring economic development in the hinterlands) through rendering of ICT
services, the project is also aligned with the government’s Economic Growth and Poverty
Reduction Strategy and is also found to be coherent with the World Bank Group’s ICT Sector
Strategy of 2012. The project adopted a combination of physical components, subsidies, and
TA that proved effective for it to meet its objectives.

3.1.2. The provision of mobile services rendered by the project has been found to benefit
various ongoing World Bank projects in improving their deliverables quality. For example,
the Mongolia Livestock and Agricultural Marketing Project takes advantage of mobile
services to collect the data for provision of index-based livestock insurance. The Mongolia
Global Partnership Early Childhood Education project takes advantage of internet services
made available in soum centers for rendering of web-based instruction and skill enhancement.

3.2     Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Satisfactory

3.2.1 The project greatly surpassed its first PDO, i.e., it significantly increased the coverage
and use of relevant ICT services among the rural population through an incentive program
designed to encourage the participation of private operators in the rural segment of the ICT
market. While mobile voice services were available only in about 100 rural soums in 2006,
mobile voice and data services became available in all 330 soum centers in Mongolia within
the first 3 years of project implementation and the project played a critical role in this. The
project directly financed capital subsidies for the establishment of the services in 90 soums
across Mongolia. In addition, the USOF established with the help of World Bank funded
technical assistance during project preparations funded capital subsidies for the establishment
of the services in about 50 additional soums. Finally, the pilot which preceded the project
and the project itself helped the operators to realize that there is significantly more demand
for services than they expected resulting in operators establishing services in the remaining
soums without subsidies on purely commercial basis. Moreover, over 150 rural herder
communities gained access to public telephony service at the bagh level; 34 soum centers
have broadband Internet access for public and private users including schools connected at
discounted rates; and a modern SMMS was successfully installed and is operating.

3.2.2 The target of increasing number of internet users in soum centers (to at least 11,000
users) was achieved. Provision of internet access in soum centers funded by the project

    Report No. 67567-MN: Country Partnership Strategy for Mongolia for the Period 201-2017


                                                   - 14 -
contributed to the rise in internet users in these soums. In addition, the extension of digital
telephony services to all soum centers partially funded by the project also helped, as in almost
all cases, mobile internet services are available wherever modern digital telephony services
are available. An overall increase in availability/usage of mobile data services and better
internet services at the soum level also helped in meeting the target.

3.2.3 The intermediate indicator associated with enhancing telephony access to herder
communities was only partially achieved, owing to the fact that the herders used the faster-
than-expected extension of mobile network coverage as a substitute to the herder network –
but there is no way to identify and measure these minutes.

3.2.4 The indicator on continued additional annual investment in the ICT sector greatly
exceeded forecasts due to the continued strong private investments in the sector. There are
two basic channels through which the project contributed to this: (a) improving the policy
and regulatory environment (the project supported this through Component 2 including the
spectrum management and monitoring system) which typically attracts additional private
sector investments; and (b) promoting investments in the rural areas which were mostly
unattractive for private investments until only a few years ago (both directly by providing
subsidies and indirectly through demonstrating that services can be provided sustainably also
in rural areas).

3.2.5 The project also contributed to the second PDO, namely, increase in private sector
participation in the delivery of e-Government services and improved public sector utilization
of ICTs. This was done by improving the enabling environment, capacity building and
awareness-raising for PPPs in general and for the implementation of e-Government services
under PPP arrangements in particular. The project achieved this through delivering: (a) PPP
framework for e-Government services and related policy, legislation and regulation;
(b) demand study and identification of e-Government services suitable for implementation
under PPP arrangements; (c) information security strategy and framework and related policy,
legislation and regulation; and (d) capacity building and training. These were essential for
the acceptance of the private sector as a partner for e-Government services by the
Government, and thereby, helped to increase the number of e-Government services provided
in partnership with the private sector and number of Government ministries and agencies
willing to accept the PPP model for e-Government. As noted above, the project fell short of
delivering on the two pilot e-Government applications due to the initial in-country
unfamiliarity with PPP models, and then later (after political changes), by the decision of the
new government to cancel the implementation of these services despite the fact that the
associated contracts had been awarded through a competitive process. However, the e-
Government applications were a relatively small part of the project (less than 10 percent of
project funding) and the overwhelming success of the much larger Component 1 outweighs
the failure to implement the e-Government applications.

3.2.6 Overall, the project has surpassed or fully achieved four of the total of six PDO
indicators and the other two have been partially achieved. The project has also achieved nine
of intermediate indicators out of a total of twelve.

3.3   Efficiency

Rating: Satisfactory


                                             - 15 -
3.3.1 The economic and financial analyses were conducted for the rural access component
(Component 1) at the time of appraisal. The nature of the rest of the project was not
amenable to a quantitative economic and financial analysis. We replicated the analyses using
the same methodology and actual post-project data (for more details see Annex 3).

3.3.2 Our financial model, using a discounted cash flow methodology, calculates that the
IRR over 10 years enjoyed by the operator of the herder network (telephony services at the
bagh level) is 22 percent which is somewhat lower than the 28 percent estimated at appraisal.
The average IRR over 10 years enjoyed by the operators of the soum level mobile networks is
37 percent which is significantly higher than the 25 percent estimated at appraisal.

3.3.3 It is estimated that the establishment of the bagh-level herder network and the
expansion of the mobile networks has reduced the distance (time and cost) to communication
from an average of 25 to 39 km to access the nearest telephone of any kind to 14 to 16 km.
The resulting economic benefits include reduced costs, improved and strengthened family
ties, improved security and coordination associated with migration and response to harsh
weather, increased economic activity, and more efficient governance and social infrastructure
activities. In addition, the soum level mobile services provide economic benefits from
improved access to telephony and Internet services demonstrated by strong demand for the
new services. The services better integrate the soum with the aimag center and national
capital and allowed social infrastructure and administration (e.g., education, health,
governance) and market-based services to become more efficient at the soum level.

3.4   Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

3.4.1 The project’s overachievement of its objective of providing ICT services to the rural
population, its contribution to increasing private sector participation in the delivery of e-
Government services, its high continued relevance to economic and social development of
Mongolia, and its financial soundness merit an overall Satisfactory rating for Outcomes.

3.5   Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1 With the objective of providing greater availability of and access to ICT services for
some of Mongolia’s poorest rural citizens, it is estimated that the project enabled about 1
million Mongolians living in rural areas, villages, and small towns to gain access to telephony
services. This was achieved by both expanding mobile services and establishing a bagh-level
herder network and by spurring sector-specific reform along with the requisite capacity
building. The improved telecom access helped these communities overcome isolation,
enhance economic activity, and promote social integration with the rest of the country. The
herder public access network, combined with the mobile services, reduced the average travel
distance required to make a call for herders to 15 km from 39 km. In most of the soum
centers, there used to be less than 10 phone lines often limited to a payphone and a few lines
in the government offices; today, there are several hundred active mobile lines in almost all,
if not all, soums with most of families having at least one phone.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

                                            - 16 -
3.5.2 Improving capacity of CRC to better regulate the rapidly expanding sector and further
empowering it through the installation of a modern SMMS was an important project
component, which was achieved. Several consultancy assignments have been successfully
completed providing transaction support for the acquisition of the Spectrum Monitoring
System, and technical assistance in the areas of spectrum policy, numbering, and HR
development at CRC. Technical assistance to support the development and implementation
of a new licensing policy was also completed in early 2013. Overall, as a result of the
regulatory strengthening component, Mongolia’s telecommunications regulator has
developed the capacity to regulate a largely private sector driven telecommunications sector,
providing the needed certainty for operators to make large investments to provide
telecommunications infrastructure and services. CRC also has the capacity and tools to
undertake important regulatory functions such as licensing, tariff regulation, spectrum
management, quality of service monitoring and regulatory compliance.

3.5.3 In the area of the delivery of e-Government services, the project helped to improve
the enabling environment for PPP in general. This is reflected in the fact that by end of
project, it was found that at least 10 government ministries and agencies were willing to
embrace the PPP model for development of e-Government services and four such e-Gov
services are being developed through the PPP model. Further, in e-Government, the project
helped propel development of policies which led to the drafting of legislation that became a
basis for a law approved later by the Parliament (in modified form). The project also helped
developed an information security framework, and financed a related capacity building and
awareness rising program.

3.5.4 The extent to which the subsidy model would produce results was unexpected and the
demand for services was underestimated. Prior to the project, only about 40 soums were
covered with mobile network as mobile operators pointed to the non-profitability of
providing services in rural areas. Using the subsidy model, a pilot was conducted through
which the operators realized the potential in these areas. As a result, the mobile operators
ventured into more soums on their own, eventually covering all 330 soums in the country,
many without using any subsidy (the World Bank subsidized provision of services in 90
soums, GoM subsidized up to 60, while the remaining were covered by the operators on their
own).

3.5.5 Perhaps the most noteworthy contribution to the institutional strengthening was
familiarizing the private sector on providing telecom services to over 150 far-flunked rural
herder communities at the bagh-level.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.5.6   None identified.


4. ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

Rating: Moderate

4.1      The risks to maintaining the development outcome as well as the risks to the overall
institutional framework for sustaining the achievements are moderate. The risk of weak

                                             - 17 -
institutional capacity risk was identified during preparation, and addressed by training in and
out of country. Given the capacity limitations of the Government, the Bank team worked to
maximize reliance on the private sector in future operation of the telecommunications and IT
service provision, while continuing to build capacity in relevant government agencies through
consultancy support and training. Training provided to regulatory staff resulted in reduced
costs and increased efficiency and effectiveness of government processes.

4.2      With the establishment and operationalization of the USOF, the major
telecommunications and ICT infrastructure needs of rural Mongolia are satisfied to a large
extent and GoM should be able to finance future projects using the USOF, barring unforeseen
developments or needs. Furthermore, as sector revenues increase, the amount of revenues
collected by the regulator from the operators has increased. Today, the sector regulator CRC
is fully self-financed. CRC has its own income from sector fees, which it uses for its ongoing
operations, capacity building, and investments in regulatory tools.

4.3     The rural access and PPPs in e-government components of this project do not impose
additional financing requirements on the Government beyond those described in the PAD as
they are based on an OBA approach and a one-time government investment in equity or
otherwise towards the PPPs, respectively. The OBA projects supported by this project were
also designed to be sustainable based on the pre-feasibility studies carried out by GoM which
estimated an IRR of 25 percent. The operators that won the OBA tenders knew up front that
their operations must be commercially sustainable.


5. ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.1 As summarized in Sections 1 and 2, the Bank’s support for the project was well
aligned with the prevailing CAS, GoM’s own ICT Vision for 2010, its e-Government Master
Plan of 2005, and complemented several ongoing operations. Saliently, the project built upon
previous initiatives by PPIAF on PPPs in Mongolia as well as GPOBA pilot projects
implemented in the country. Objectives and components of the three partners (IDA, PHRD,
and GoM) were dovetailed and well integrated into the design of the project. Working
relationships with the Borrower, stakeholders and co-financiers were productive and
supportive. During preparation, the Bank team assisted GoM in designing the project to meet
the Bank’s technical, financial, economic, fiduciary, social and environment standards. It
also helped shape the training programs to strengthen the institutional capacity of the relevant
government and ICT sector authorities, the PIU, and other stakeholder organizations. Project
design was kept simple and adapted to the limited government capacity with overall risk
rightly rated as moderate. The Bank budget preparation costs were relatively modest at some
$120,000.

5.1.2 The project introduced innovations such as using incentives to the private-sector for
expanding telecom services across the country, international standards and good practices,
and establishment of an enabling environment for applying PPP frameworks in Mongolia’s

                                             - 18 -
ICT sector. The outcome indicators focused on quantifiable results for which the project
could reasonably be held accountable.

5.1.3 The fact that the project design didn't foresee the curtailment of herder network by the
rapid expansion of mobile network is not unusual, as the development of mobile networks
historically outperformed even the most optimistic forecasts in most of the world. In 2006,
the unprecedented expansion of mobile networks, which brought mobile coverage to all
soums before the end of 2008, in a country with the world's lowest population density, was
not anticipated, given that only about 100 out of the 330 soums had mobile coverage in 2006.
This made the herder network obsolete in many areas and made it suitable only as for deep
rural areas. Ultimately, however the herders received a better service, so, this should be seen
a success not as a failure. The project design acknowledged risks associated with the
implementation of e-Government applications as PPPs but, given the significant potential
benefits, it was decided to follow this approach and try to mitigate the associated risks.

5.1.4 Overall, quality of Bank performance at entry had several strengths, which have been
decisive in overcoming key challenges and ensuring good progress towards the key
indicators. First, the team focused closely on the development effectiveness during project
design. Second, the Bank team was proactive by asking for the sector to be moved to the
Office of the Prime Minister, where it received more high level attention than hitherto. Third,
the risk of weak institutional capacity was identified during preparation, and addressed by
training programs, within and outside of the country.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.5 Supervision of the project was regular and vigorous. The Bank task team conducted
twice yearly supervision missions, with several visits to outlying towns and rural areas to
verify and experience mobile and satellite services that have already been rolled out, service
quality, and the reception of users. The supervision team had all the needed skills, with
technical support from the Bank’s leading specialist in e-government and e-applications
generally, besides staff with skills and experience in other areas. The team made good use of
the supervision budget, given the relatively modest allocation of $70,000 per year, which
remained flat during the implementation period. Even then the team has managed to bring in
the Lead Specialist to help supervise the e-government component, when that component
faced delays. Similarly, the team also managed by piggy-backing several countries to
arrange for a relatively good part of the team to join each supervision mission.

5.1.6 The procurement and financial management aspects were carefully supervised by the
Bank team and no F&C issues have been uncovered or reported during implementation. In
terms of procurement oversight, considering the overall weakness of the implementing
agencies, the risk mitigation measures put in place from inception worked very well,
particularly the comprehensive capacity building program to strengthen CRC and ICTA’s
institutional capabilities that was organized. Procurement difficulties in the first year were
identified, responded to, and resolved by the team with an intensive supervision effort. The
Bank not only supervised but supported the project timely and diligently, working with other
donors to provide international consultants who were employed with funding from the
Japanese PHRD grant. A two stage procurement process for the e-Government services was
proposed by the team to address the limited experience with PPP in Mongolia. In addition,

                                            - 19 -
various toolkits and new regulatory policies were introduced, while ensuring that bid
documents were properly designed and contained appropriate specifications and evaluation
criteria. All supervision aide-memoires report on procurement issues with no major findings.
Ex-post reviews demonstrate most contracts have been properly awarded and only minor
procedural issues have been found. No supplemental audits or independent procurement
reviews appear to have taken place. Project sites were visited regularly and this has been
properly documented in the aide-memoires and supervision reports, with no high value/high
risk contracts identified. Supervision missions have been quite detailed and thorough with
only minor or procedural issues found. These have been highlighted and corrective actions
taken in a timely and efficient manner.

5.1.7 Fiduciary aspects were properly reflected in aide-memoires with adequate integration
of procurement and FM supervision into overall project supervision. The numerous financial
management inputs to supervision activities somewhat exceeded the requirements of the
assessed moderate level of risk. Partly, this was aimed at preemptive identification of issues
and helping the client to resolve them.

5.1.8 The only shortcoming identified in supervision was the lack of oversight for some of
the social aspects. As noted in Social Aspects (para 2.4.5) more could have been achieved by
better capturing benefits disaggregated by social groups and gender. This represents,
possibly, a missed opportunity to capture significant positive social development outcomes
from the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.9 Bank performance is rated satisfactory. The Bank engaged with the Government
initially through Bank executed technical assistance in the sector. Significant expert
resources were invested for knowledge transfer activities and to familiarize the client with
market based approaches to providing services in rural areas. The project team kept the
project design simple and ensured implementation readiness that allowed on-time completion
of the rural connectivity component. Adequate resources were allocated for implementation
support and supervision, with ongoing transfer of knowledge to the client on policy,
regulatory, and project implementation issues.

5.1.10 The project was assessed by QAG as part of the Second Quality Assessment of the
Lending Portfolio (QALP-2) in 2010. Quality of Design was assessed as Satisfactory and
Quality of Bank Supervision as Highly Satisfactory.

5.2   Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.1 The project received overall strong government commitment. GoM’s ownership of
the project was partly through the ICT Vision 2010 paper, the E-Government Master Plan
and the participation in the design of the OBA approach for rural access. The GoM exhibited
its commitment by co-financing an amount of $1.85 million, representing over 15 percent of

                                            - 20 -
total project costs. This demonstrates the importance of this project for the Government as it
was very rare for GoM to contribute to project costs at that time. There was also clear
assignment of responsibilities by Government among its various agencies, and overall, the
government agencies concerned had been able to keep implementation proceeding on track.
GoM also used the project’s PPP framework to enact a law embodying this PPP concept for
all sectors, which is another indication of the government’s responsiveness and interest in the
project. In addition, no F&C issues had been uncovered or reported during implementation.

5.2.2 Overall, GoM helped facilitate implementation to progress on track with
disbursements only slightly behind the original schedule. By March 21, 2012, $7.14 million
(SDR 4.64 million) has been disbursed from the IDA grant, representing over 83 percent of
the IDA grant proceeds, and $1.68 million had been disbursed from the PHRD grant,
representing over 83 percent of the PHRD grant proceeds.

5.2.3 While the project has contributed to the increase in private sector participation in the
delivery of e-Government services through improving the enabling environment and
awareness-raising for the implementation of e-Government services under PPP arrangements,
the two pilot e-Government applications targeted by the project could not be implemented as
the PPP approach was new for the Government and it took some time to finalize the PPP
model to apply as well as to develop the bidding documents (see Table 3). Later, following
the elections in mid-2012, the new GoM decided to cancel the implementation of these
applications despite the fact that the associated contracts had been awarded through a
competitive process. Therefore, the earlier considered second extension of the closing date to
allow for the implementation of these e-Government applications to be completed could not
be processed. Consequently, the IDA funds allocated to the implementation of these two e-
Government applications ($1 million) were canceled.

5.2.4 Another shortcoming noted was that staff of this new client (for client executed
projects) was neither familiar nor trained in Bank procedures at the beginning of
implementation, which delayed start up. However, the initial slow and sluggish processes
were corrected and set on the right track.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.5 An interagency/ministry steering committee and an adequately staffed PIU were
established before project launch. The PIU was responsible for project management,
monitoring and evaluation, reporting to the Project Steering Committee, GoM, and the World
Bank. During the course of implementation, it was found that the PIU was committed to
achieving the PDO as the unit made major strides in efficiency, management and oversight of
project execution, M&E, financial management procurement, and promoted the project’s
longer-term sustainability. Focus on capacity building was apparent as staff often
participated in training activities to enhance their skills in carrying out their management and
procurement functions.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory


                                             - 21 -
5.2.6 Given the government’s satisfactory performance (relentless corrective actions,
commitment and support to the project) combined with satisfactory role of the PIU
(exemplary efficiency, management, oversight, and coordination skills), overall performance
of GoM is considered satisfactory.


6. LESSONS LEARNED

6.1     It is important to ensure that adequate upfront preparation is done prior to project
approval. The World Bank engaged for the first time in the ICT sector in Mongolia, initially
through Bank executed TA. The CRC implementation of the GPOBA pilots helped the client
learn from market approaches to universal access, and also familiarized them with World
Bank procurement and financial management procedures. This allowed for the successful
and timely completion of the rural access component.

6.2     In projects of such nature, where private sector participation is a critical success factor,
it is important to ensure credible stakeholder consultation. The client ensured that it
consulted widely with private sector in order to gauge both their interest and design a
practical approach to providing access in rural areas.

6.3     The results of the implementation of the universal access program demonstrates that
an OBA subsidy auction can work to reach “beyond the market” for both rural telephony and
Internet services by attracting private sector investments. The project proved that there is
significant untapped demand for mobile services in rural areas. However, the Internet service
provision developed more slowly, focusing on those soums which have the best chance of
sustaining commercial Internet services after the award of the one-time subsidies and have
“Internet-ready” schools that can most benefit from the service.

6.4     Key factors which contributed to the success of the universal access component of the
project are summarized as follows:

   •   CRC’s consistent and committed leadership in the management of USOF
   •   Very positive and supportive response of the operators to support USOF and compete
       for the subsidies in challenging markets
   •   The World Bank’s involvement with $5 million seed money to the USOF,
       guaranteeing the operators a benefit ahead of their contributions into the fund.

6.5    On Component 3, it was realized that a more conservative approach is required for
accessing the capacity and speed at which e-government solutions can be implemented,
especially when adopting a PPP approach. Preparation of enabling environment must
precede efforts to implement e-Government services—if enabling environment preparation is
delayed all downstream activities should be delayed as well. Beneficiary agencies and target
services should be identified prior to project inception.

6.6     The World Bank’s lack of standard bidding document for PPPs in e-Government
contributed to the delays. If e-Government PPPs are to be prioritized, either (a) adapted
standard bidding documents should be produced, or (b) the bidding approach should be
identified during project design and work on the contractual aspects of the bidding documents
should begin at project inception.


                                              - 22 -
6.7     In addition, the project’s failure of delivering on the two pilot e-Government
applications is linked to electoral changes—in a country like Mongolia where political and
business interests overlap—political changes due to democratic elections sometimes lead to
different business decisions which affect project implementation. Until the political
environment in Mongolia matures, it would be preferable to avoid scheduling system
procurements which span more than one election cycle.

6.8     Continuity in the Project Implementation Unit is key for satisfactory project
implementation. Over the project period, the PIU director was changed only once. There
was continuity in fiduciary staff working on the project. Despite change in government and
leadership at the implementation agencies, the PIU was a constant that helped keep the
project on track.

Component 1: Information and communications infrastructure development in rural areas


                                      Capital subsidy support was provided to telephony services for herder
                                      communities of 152 baghs of 76 soums. But annual telephone
                                      minutes originating from the herder network are estimated to be about
                                      530,000 annual minutes by end-2012, below 1,200,000 annual
      Capital subsidy support to      minutes projected at appraisal. This shortfall is attributed to fast
      provide telephony services      mobile networks expansion in the hinterlands, resulting in herders
A
      at the bagh level (for herder   using mobile phones instead of herder network. The herder network
      communities)                    was thereby scaled back, with 192 communities plugged into the
                                      network by end-2012 as opposed to initial projection of 350 during
                                      appraisal. The herder public access network, combined with the
                                      mobile services, reduced the average travel distance required to make
                                      a call for herders to 15 km from 39 km.

                                      The project provided capital subsidy support to mobile
                                      communications services in 90 soums and to Internet services for 34
                                      soum centers. This contributed to a leap in annual telephony minutes
                                      originating in soum centers from 1.2 million in 2006 to 56.5 million
                                      by end -2012, and an increase in internet users from 300 in 2006 to
      Capital subsidy support to      12,000 by end-2012. Today, all (330) soums have access to mobile
      provide telephony or            data and modern telephony services while 34 soums have access to
B
      internet services for soum      high speed internet. While the overall increase in availability/usage
      centers                         of cellular and mobile data services at the soum level played a key
                                      role in achievement of targets, the extension of digital telephony
                                      services to all soum centers partially funded by the project also
                                      helped. This is being stated, as in almost all cases, mobile internet
                                      services become available wherever modern digital telephony
                                      services are available.

                                      Through a consultancy, CRC was provided with transaction support at

                                      The e-Government applications in the areas supported by the project
                                      were not implemented. This is because the PPP approach was new
                                      for the Government and it took some time to finalize the PPP model
                                      to apply as well as to develop the bidding documents. Following the
                                      elections in mid-2012, the new Government decided to implement
      Technical assistance for        these applications following a different approach (although contracts
C     developing a project in the     for the implementation of both applications had been awarded) and
      area of e-Government            through different sources of funding. Thereafter, the earlier

                                      implementation of these e-Government applications could not be
                                      processed. Consequently, the IDA funds allocated to the
                                      implementation of these two e-Government applications ($1 million)
                                      were canceled.

                      ANNEX 3. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

The economic and financial analyses were conducted for the rural access component
(Component 1) at the time of appraisal. The rural access component provided competitively
awarded capital subsidies to operators responsible for installing, marketing, operating, and
maintaining ICT systems and services at soum- and bagh-level on a commercial basis. The
nature of the rest of the project was not amenable to a quantitative economic and financial
analysis. We replicated the analyses using the same methodology and actual post-project
data where available.

The total financial benefits of each subcomponent include the potential sales for the operators
derived from the expanded access to telecommunications in rural areas. The total costs for
the project consist of investment costs; operation and maintenance costs; administrative,
marketing and sales costs; and interconnection costs (including the cost of satellite space
segment if VSAT technology is used).

Our financial model, using a discounted cash flow methodology, calculates that the IRR over
10 years (assuming no terminal value) enjoyed by the operator of the herder network
(telephony services at the bagh-level) is 22 percent which is somewhat lower than the 28
percent estimated at appraisal. The average revenue per site turned out to be significantly
lower than expected due to the faster-than-expected extension of mobile network coverage
used by the herders as a substitute for the herder network. However, this was somewhat
compensated with the lower-than-expected capital costs while the competitively awarded
average subsidy per site was about 6 percent higher than expected.

Our discounted cash flow model calculates that the average IRR over 10 years (assuming no
terminal value) enjoyed by the operators of the soum level mobile networks is 37 percent
which is significantly higher than the 25 percent estimated at appraisal. The average revenue
per site turned out to be higher than expected due to both significantly higher number of users
and somewhat higher average revenue per user. This was somewhat compensated with the
higher-than-expected capital costs due to the operators opting for more conventional GSM
and CDMA technologies instead of lower cost (but untested) alternatives. The competitively
awarded average subsidy per site was about 10 percent higher than expected.

It is estimated that the establishment of the bagh-level herder network and the expansion of
the mobile networks have reduced the distance (time and cost) to communication from an
average of 25 to 39 km to access the nearest telephone of any kind to 14 to 16 km. The
resulting economic benefits include reduced costs, improved and strengthened family ties,
improved security and coordination associated with migration and response to harsh weather,
increased economic activity, and more efficient governance and social infrastructure
activities. In addition, the soum-level mobile services provide economic benefits from
improved access to telephony and Internet services demonstrated by strong demand for the
new services. The services better integrate the soum with the aimag center and national
capital and allowed social infrastructure and administration (e.g., education, health,
governance) and market-based services to become more efficient at the soum-level. The
services leverage Mongolia’s high literacy rate and its traditional high priority on education
by offering improved opportunities for children, as well as adults, to access the benefits of the
information society.

ANNEX 7. SUMMARY OF BORROWER'S ICR AND/OR COMMENTS ON DRAFT ICR


The following report summarizes the views of representatives of the ICTPA and CRC on the
implementation and completion of the Information and Communications Infrastructure
Development project, co-financed by the International Development Association (IDA), the
Government of Japan Policy and Human Resource Development (PHRD) facility, with
funding from the Government of Mongolia.

1. Project Objective


The objective of the Information and Communications Infrastructure Development project
was to support the Government of Mongolia in the implementation of the universal service
strategy and e-Mongolia national program to significantly increase the coverage and use of
relevant ICT services among the rural population through an incentive program designed to
encourage the participation of private operators in the rural segment of the ICT market; and
increase private sector participation in the delivery of e-Government services, thereby
improving public sector utilization of ICT.


2.    Project Components

The project had three main interrelated components aimed at achieving the project
development objective. The first component, and primary focus of the project, entailed
private sector led development of the information and communications infrastructure in rural
Mongolia, through OBA schemes. Investment support provided for the deployment of
infrastructure and public access to ICT services. As the regulatory agenda in Mongolia
continued to evolve, the project supported the regulator in establishing a regime that
promoted fair competition and market based incentives for the provision of access in rural
Mongolia. The third component entailed building ICT policy leadership in Mongolia and
included investment support for the implementation of key aspects of the national ICT policy
focusing on increased and improved use of ICTs in the public sector. The following
components were outlined in the Project Appraisal Document in 2006.

2.1 Information and communications infrastructure development in rural areas

Component on Information and communications infrastructure development in rural areas
was to include the following impacts:

     a. Establish and institute a competitive and transparent process for private sector
        participation in providing infrastructure access and services in rural and economically
        unviable areas of Mongolia through the implementation of the Government’s universal
        access strategy in order to accelerate the provision of telephony and Internet services
        in rural Mongolia.

        at every stage of the implementation of Mongolia’s Universal Access strategy to
        accelerate the development of rural telecommunications infrastructure and services in
        locations that were deemed unlikely to attract sufficient private investment. In
        particular, under the project, existing service providers were awarded least-cost
                                              - 32 -

This component financed technical assistances in the following areas:
- Developing the policy, legal and regulatory frameworks for PPPs in e-Government
- Conducting a detailed feasibility study to identify PPP project opportunities for e-
Government, and develop Requests for Proposals to roll out those applications with most
potential;
- Developing an information security framework.
- Capacity building of ITPTA


2.4 Project Management


This component provided support for the operating costs of the Project Implementation Unit
(PIU) that managed the project. Specifically, the project financed the services of a Project
Director, Procurement Officer, and Financial Officer. The project also financed limited
office equipment, furniture, a vehicle, audit, and limited incremental operating costs
including office supplies, in-country travel costs and other operational expenses.

3.   Benefits and Target population

The project’s successful implementation yielded the following benefits to citizens, policy and
regulatory institutions and industries:

The universal access program

 •   Although only 90 soums benefited directly from IDA financed subsidies, a large number
     of additional soums benefited indirectly as the UA/US program demonstrated that
     demand for services in rural areas is significantly higher than originally expected. 100%
     of the 335 soums now have at least one mobile operator and more than 250 soums have
     two or three operators present, in many cases also enabling a medium-speed Internet
     service.

                                            - 34 -
•   The herder public access network, combined with the mobile services, reduced the
    average travel distance required to make a call for herders to 15 km from 39 km.
•   34 prime soum centers have broadband Internet access for public and private users at the
    same tariffs as in the capital, Ulanbaatar; schools are connected at discounted rates, and
    in all of these 34 communities people are benefitting from access to public Internet cafés.
•   With the infrastructure and service in place across the country, many more rural
    residents are able to communicate more easily, and benefit from educational and
    commercial access to the Internet.
•   The significant subsidies offered under both the pilots and ICIDP project effectively
    seeded and strengthened the USOF’s mandate by offering capital contributions which
    matched and were ahead of operators’ contributions to the USOF. This demonstrated
    the benefits of the USOF OBA style competitions to operators and thus increased its
    acceptance. Moreover, the tenders were prepared in consultation with operators and
    stakeholders, which increased their acceptance by the industry;

• The Project resulted increased accessibility also opened a range of opportunities for the
  government, private sector firms, civil society organizations and development partners
  to enhance service delivery by using new technologies.
• The views of stakeholders who have observed the progress of the ICIDP and earlier
  related programs implemented through the World Bank partnership stated that
  Mongolia’s UA program is internationally a “best case” example of universal service
  development and funding in challenging environments.

Regulatory strengthening

•   CRC was supplied with installation of SMMS on May 15, 2009. The facility is
    successfully used by CRC staff. Thanks to the successful implementation, convenient
    and practical circumstances have been created to monitor the activities of radio
    frequency users, detecting illegal users, as well as monitor the activities of legal radio
    frequency users. This contributes to a favorable environment for fair competition and
    deployment of new technologies and services in Mongolia.
•   As a result of the project, CRC is now supported by the Automated Spectrum
    Monitoring System with automated and efficient management of the radio spectrum
    resource. The system which is composed from administrative and technical software
    tools is facilitating planning, allocation, registration of radio spectrum and estimating
    radio wave propagation. 2 stage trainings from highly qualified trainers with firsthand
    experience offered to CRC staff strengthening their capacity for radio spectrum
    management.
•   With the help of consultancy service on Spectrum policy, CRC had assigned the entire
    3G spectrum to 4 mobile operators, the Spectrum Master Plan has been developed and is
    being regularly updated, and the Spectrum management handbook was published.
•   The developed Telecommunications Network Numbering Plan of Mongolia under the
    consultancy service on numbering has been approved.                    According to the
    recommendations of the consultant, CRC also introduced fees for telecommunications
    network numbering starting from January 1, 2008; established number utilization
    contracts; and organized a tender for the provision of 800 and 900 services in Mongolia.
•   Updated regulatory regime, thanks to the unified licensing consultancy applied in the
    regulatory activities for converged services in the sector.


                                           - 35 -
    •    The HR policy and development plan of CRC is being implemented as a result of HRD
         consultancy. The capacity of CRC was built through foreign trainings, in-country
         organized trainings and seminars, and study tours. 48 CRC staff have benefitted from
         foreign trainings and seminars, 1 local HRD training involving 40 CRC staff and UA
         final workshop was organized involving representatives from all stakeholders of UA/US
         programs.

PPP utilization in e-Government

    •    The draft legislation and other deliverables developed under the consultancy on enabling
         environment for PPPs in e-Government have been used by the Parliamentary ad-hoc
         committee on PPPs and the newly established National Development and Innovation
         Committee during the development of the newly approved Concession Law of Mongolia.
    •    The draft Information Security law and e-Signature law have been developed under the
         consultancy on information security, and e-Signature law has been approved by the
         Parliament in 2012. The draft Information security law is in the process of submittal to
         the Parliament for approval.
    •    The capacity of ITPTA was enhanced and 34 ITPTA staff who have taken training
         abroad financed by project funds provided short reports on the training taken and on the
         training’s benefit for their day to day work and performance. About 360 government
         officials from at least 50 entities have participated in training organized within
         Mongolia and partially financed by the project. In addition, 25 ITPTA and 2 PIU staff
         have received English language training financed by the project.

3. Description of the Main risks to project success

•       Weak institutional capacity of policy and regulatory entities hampers sector development
        and project implementation

To address this risk, the project provided a comprehensive program of capacity building to
strengthen CRC and ITPTA’s institutional capabilities. The consultants assisted both
agencies in the development of various policy and regulatory toolkits and draft documents,
and to design and prepare bid specifications for the rural access tenders, radio spectrum
monitoring system, automated spectrum management system and e-applications to provide
Government services through PPP models. In-house capacity through training programs to
address policy and regulatory issues and administer the USOF had a very positive impact on
CRC for implementing US/UA program in Mongolia though the capacity building effort for
ITPTA could not reach the project’s respective objective due to discontinuity of the staff at
both managers and executing officers levels. The risk on possible project management was
addressed during the project implementation and with efforts and supports of the contracted
consultants and World Bank task team members, overall project implementation, rural access
related procurement and contractual issues have been properly executed.

•       The government’s strategy on improving and consolidating ICT leadership, policy and
        regulation is not sustained

The UA strategy and USOF were successfully implemented and maintained under ICIDP as
CRC was strongly committed with consolidated, and also maintained its corporate
commitment and ensured staff continuity, despite changes in the organization’s senior

                                                - 36 -
management; there was a good level of skills assimilation and national program ownership
within CRC at the critical times, which continued throughout the ICIDP implementation. On
the other side, as the implementation of the project passed through 2 elections and changes in
the government as well as in the ITPTA have caused challenges to keep sustainability of
policy and regulation, thus failed to achieve the project objective.

•   Limited participation in the OBA tenders

This risk was addressed during the implementation of UA/US program and as CRC’s
capacity was strengthened. Thanks to the consultancy service by the best qualified
consultants on the assignment, CRC adopted open consultation in the industry for the
program and the tenders were prepared in consultation with operators and stakeholders,
which increased their acceptance and facilitated participation in the program. All operators
(4 mobile operators, 1 telecom operator and 2 ISPs) participated in the tenders and were
awarded with the contracts for their respective successful bids and effectively contributed to
the project success on US/UA program.


•   Risks of subsidizing commercially viable ventures or otherwise unsustainable businesses.

Cost-benefit analysis of the projects were carried out by the consultants based on all of the
strategic lessons learned from the current pilots, including actual revenues earned, costs
incurred and the competitive behavior observed in the tendering process, and demand studies
done during the existing project. For selecting locations for all three programs, priority
areas have been advised by CRC taking account of the consultants’ studies for demands
which involved the population distributions, geographic area, the number of baghs, rural
household income, the potential affordability, revenue capacity of each soum centre and
herder community. CRC noticed that the least subsidy design of the project was to avoid of
risks subsidizing unsustainable businesses.

•   Lack of private sector interest in PPPs in e-Government

This risk was a key concern during the two consultancy services to enable PPP environment
and identification of possible e- government applications through PPP. 22 proposed projects
of e-Mongolia program have been studied for targets to apply PPP approaches where only
two projects such as Portals system which would serve as a single window for government,
citizen and businesses, and Public key infrastructure- Certification authority have been
chosen as suitable for the existing situation according to the international best practices as
well as the needs of ITPTA, the client,. Bidding of two applications had 2 stages and during
pre-proposal meetings, interests of private sectors showed comparatively high for instance 9
companies were interested in PKI/CA only 3 of them submitted bid proposals, 6 companies
were interested in Portals project whereas only 2 of them submitted bid proposals. Private
sector concerned the legal environment for PPP which was just introduced in e-government.


4. Key Sectoral development issues for the Period

The key milestones and developments of the information and communications sector that
have been taken place during the project period are as follows:


                                            - 37 -
•   Competition and market development
Strong competition in the sector has positively impacted the ICT market development in
addition to implementation of US/UA programs under ICIDP and USOF projects. The
Mobile telephony penetration in 2012 is increased two times from 2007 reaching 116 though
the fixed telephony density is decreased from 19 to 16 in respective years. Tariff of mobile
communications services have been decreased 4-7 times compare with the first mobile
service launch in 1996.

•   Infrastructure

To date, 178 soums or 51% of the total 347 soums have been connected to the broadband
network (161 by ICNC and 17 soums by private), 34% or 120 are expected to be connected
through programs and projects, 49 soums have been left with no broadband coverage. The
length of broadband dedicated FOC has been reached to 18,343.3 km and 43% is by ICNC,
28% is by Mobicom, 8% is by Railcom, 7% is by Gemnet and 15% is by Skynetwork. If it’s
compared to the project start date, the number of soums covered with broadband network is
extended by 4-5 times. The backbone network is mostly under the control of the Government
although the private operators invested in the last 2-3 years. Separation policy which was
adopted since 2005 has been applied only for the state owned operator. Though the
separation is done, the network efficiency has not yet improved.

•   Policy and regulatory framework

Over the last 5-10 years the telecommunication sector in Mongolia has been guided by a
series of master plans, policies and programs. The project implementation has gone through
two governments but main policies of e-Mongolia have been maintained. Most recently
approved policies focused on broadband national program, e-Government national program
and digital switchover of broadcasting system. USOF management has been shifted from
CRC to ITPTA as a result of amendments to the Communications law, though USOF
strategies have been kept as they are. There has been approved a new law on e-Signature.

The new government is strongly relying on ICT to achieve its commitments and ITPTA has
defined 7 priorities for ICT development based on the national ICT Policy document - a 2021
vision which is not yet approved by the parliament. 7 priorities include national satellite
launching, delivery of seamless government services, extension of affordable rural broadband
internet, digital switchover of radio and television broadcasting, HRD, e-products and postal
service renovation through IT advancements. These priorities have a number of activities
planned to be achieved until 2016.

During the project period, regulations mostly focused on promoting more open competition,
introducing new technologies and improving service quality. The licensing regime has been
updated to meet converged environment in the sector by renewing license classifications as
infrastructure- only for setting up networks and lease the networks, services and content.
Terms and conditions of licenses -have been revised according to the respective
classifications. As IPTV, 3G, WiMax, WiFi and triple services have been introduced, content
development is required thus content regulations have been developed and applied. Non-
geographical numbering regulation is applied and tariff was set up independent from distance
differences in order to eliminate the digital divide. To develop rural internet, prices for
transmission network for internet services have been decreased. Due to convergence of

                                           - 38 -
services, regulatory activities are also converged and in this regard, broadcasting regulation is
dealt by the ICT sector’s regulator. Regulatory activities for broadcasting content,
competition amongst broadcasters, development of content, and migration to digital content
are starting causing new efforts for the regulator.

•   USOF

The USOF of Mongolia was legally created in 2000 and became operational in 2006. In
2007 USOF became managed by CRC when it started collecting the levy imposed on the ICT
licensees (2% of gross profit) and disbursing under the Special Funds Law of Mongolia.
USOF took advantage of the practical experience gained working with the World Bank-
funded projects inclusive pilots and ICIDP. The USOF management was transferred to
ICTPA by the amendment of the Communications Law approved in December 2008 and a
Government resolution issued in May 2009. For the period from 2007 to 2012, over 50
projects have been implemented by USOF funding in mobile telecommunications, IT-internet,
radio and television, post and demand studies disbursing more than 16 billion tugrug in a total.

6. Project Management and Implementation

The project was officially launched in 2006 during a one day workshop with key stakeholders
consisted from MOF, the ITPTA and CRC. Components 1 and 2 were implemented by CRC
and Components 3 and 4 were managed by ITPTA respectively.
The project was initially to close on 31 March 2012. In late 2011, the MoF requested an
extension of the closing date for a further 12 months to the 31 March 2013 to complete the
ongoing activities related to implementing e-Government applications using Public-Private
Partnership approach. Due to delays of the procurement process of the two applications,
Public Key Infrastructure and Certification Authority and Portal System and VPN and the
World Bank approved the extension of the Closing Date of the Project by one (1) year as of
March 31, 2013. Meantime, reallocation between disbursement categories was needed, as
several categories have been overdrawn due to reasons such as higher than expected and
unexpected costs, thus the saved funds were reallocated to the overdrawn Categories upon
approval of the World Bank.
Activities of the first two components have been accomplished within the project period, but
activities for implementing e-Government applications using Public-Private Partnership
approach have been delayed. Though the PPP agreement for Public Key Infrastructure and
Certification Authority was signed within the project period, the court dispute was raised by
the lost bidder and the implementation has been cancelled with concerns of national security
and state secrecy issues. The procurement process for the project on Portal System and VPN
was near to complete with expectation to sign the agreement, but, a new management team of
ITPTA who took the office after a new reform government in September 2013 considered the
project as a beyond-line with its concept to implement e-government policies. As
implementation of two application projects have been cancelled by the GoM, the allocated
budgets have been cancelled and withdrawn by the WB.
Throughout the project the Steering Committee which was chaired by the Chairman of
ITPTA met quarterly to discuss the progress of all activities. The PSC was composed from
the Chairman of ITPTA, Chief Executive Officer of CRC, two officials from the MOF each
at Director level, an official from ITPTA at Director level, and a member of the Board of


                                             - 39 -
CRC. Due to changes in appointees of line stakeholders, a composition of the PSC has been
re-formed 3 times for the project period.
The PSC was supported by PIU that was set up at ITPTA on March 28, 2006 and made up
from a Project director, a Procurement specialist and a financial specialist who cooperated
closely with technical experts from ITPTA and CRC. PIU provided PSC, World Bank, MoF
and other respective agencies with a monthly progress report in order to update them
regarding ongoing project activities. The Financial Monitoring Report has been provided
quarterly.
The project implementation and management was regularly supported by World Bank’s in-
country supervision missions held twice a year. A mid-term review was carried out between
June 9 and 24, 2009 by the WB task team. Separate financial missions by the WB Finance
Specialist were carried out on annual basis. The project financial accounts were audited in
line with the GoM financial periods (January 1 - December 31) by the selected auditors of the
MoF in first 5 years, and last one and a half year financial accounts were audited by the Chief
auditor due to restructuring of duties in the MoF. The procurement plan was updated on
regular basis during World Bank in-country supervision mission.

6. Lessons learned

The key lessons learnt from this project’s experience are the importance of ensuring
continuity of client leadership and strong commitments taken at both- decision making
and executive levels.
The Universal Access and Service programs have successfully achieved their goals
thanks to a 10 year partnership between the Government of Mongolia and World Bank.
The program has started in developing Universal Access Strategy and to prepare a
Manual of Operating Procedures for the USOF, with support from the World Bank and
Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) in 2004. Subsequently, the
Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid (GPOBA) supported the piloting of the
Universal Access leading to UA/US programs under ICIDP. All these activities were
managed and executed through continuous leaders and executors of financing, consulting
and implementing parties where the lessons learnt taken account and successes achieved
were advanced in latter programs.

In contrast, projects for PPP utilization in e-government services suffered due to lack of
continuity at both managerial and executive level, and so, unfortunately these failed to
reach the initially envisioned objectives. Nevertheless, the identified applications are still
high on the agenda of e-government service deliveries.
