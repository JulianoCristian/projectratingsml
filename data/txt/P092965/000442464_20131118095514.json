  Mongolia were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, risk\n            to development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: the Communications Regulation\n            Commission (CRC) implementation of the Global Partnership on\n            Output-Based Aid (GPOBA) pilots helped the client learn from\n            market approaches to universal access, and also familiarized\n            them with World Bank procurement and financial management\n            procedures. This allowed for the successful and timely\n            completion of the rural access component. The client ensured\n            that it consulted widely with private sector in order to\n            gauge both their interest and design a practical approach to\n            providing access in rural areas. The project proved that\n            there is significant untapped demand for mobile services in\n            rural areas. Beneficiary agencies and target services should\n            be identified prior to project inception. If e-Government\n            public private partnerships (PPPs) are to be prioritized,\n            either: (a) adapted standard bidding documents should be\n            produced, or (b) the bidding approach should be identified\n            during project design and work on the contractual aspects of\n            the bidding documents should begin at project inception.\n            Until the political environment in Mongolia matures, it will\n            be preferable to avoid scheduling system procurements which\n            span more than one election cycle. Despite change in\n            government and leadership at the implementation agencies,\n            the project implementation unit (PIU) was a constant that\n            helped keep the project on track."}, "docdt": "2013-09-25T00:00:00Z"}
