education\n            at primary, and secondary education, by improving access,\n            and equity of education, and by enhancing the efficiency of\n            the education system, while improving the vocational,\n            technical, and higher education systems. The components\n            focus on: 1) improving the quality of the teaching-learning\n            processes, contents and outputs in primary education. The\n            pre-service teacher education will improve areas such as\n            knowledge of subject matter, pedagogical skills, curricula\n            knowledge, and leadership, to be complemented by the\n            in-service training to upgrade linguistic skills of\n            teachers, to introduce competency-based curricula, and\n            provide continuous professional development to teachers. The\n            training programs will be consolidated, through the\n            distribution of textbooks, management capacity building for\n            early childhood development, and community, and private\n            participation initiatives; 2) increasing universal access to\n            primary, and secondary education by 2005, by improving the\n            planning capacity of education inputs, at the central and\n            regional levels. Private sector involvement, functional\n            literacy, and girls, and non-formal education will be\n            promoted; 3) improving the efficiency of the educational\n            system, by making technical, and professional training more\n            responsive to market demands. Human, and physical capacities\n            of the technical, and professional training centers will be\n            upgraded, viewing at improving higher education, and science\n            and technology research; and, 4) enhancing pedagogic\n            management capacity, through an overall monitoring\n            structure, and improved management of human resources in the\n            education sector."}, "docdt": "2001-09-26T00:00:00Z"}
