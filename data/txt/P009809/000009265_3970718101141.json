is to improve\n            urban services, including area development, slum upgrading,\n            and sanitation, in up to ten cities in the State of Madhya\n            Pradesh and to strengthen national, state and local\n            institutions involved in policy, planning and implementation\n            of urban development projects. The project would directly\n            benefit over 55,000 households under the area development\n            and slum upgrading programs and some 500,000 people would\n            benefit from improved sanitation facilities.  The main\n            project risks include delay in land acquisition for area\n            development and limited capacity of the implementing\n            agencies to handle this new kind of project.  These\n            constraints were kept in view in designing the\n            project's size, scope and institutional strengthening\n            measures.  These considerations and the steps already taken\n            by the state in land acquisition and in the recruitment of\n            consultants required for institutional strengthening should\n            minimize these risks."}, "docdt": "1983-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
