 its capacity to deliver good roads and a well maintained\n            network.  The project includes three components.  The first\n            component, civil works includes:  (i) road improvements;\n            (ii) road rehabilitation; and (iii) a pilot unpaved-road\n            stabilization program to treat 80 km of unpaved roads with\n            sulfonated oils to test whether the process adapts and is\n            implementable in Paraguay.  The second component, consulting\n            services, includes:  (i) engineering services to supervise\n            the civil works, engineer the pilot unpaved road\n            stabilization program, design the resurfacing works, and\n            engineer and design improvements to Ytay and Lambare creeks;\n            (ii) studies for the Asuncion Transporation Master Plan; and\n            (iii) technical assistance, including a management review of\n            MOPC, assistance to the environmental unit, strengthening\n            the Department of Highway's highway design and roadwork\n            planning capabilities, and implementation of a national\n            vehicle registry.  The third component, procurement of\n            equipment, including computers to implement the national\n            vehicle registry, and equipment and machines for a soils and\n            materials laboratory."}, "docdt": "1993-11-24T00:00:00Z"}
