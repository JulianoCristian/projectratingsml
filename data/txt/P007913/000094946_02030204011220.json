satisfactory\n            despite an unlikely sustainability, and moderate\n            institutional development impacts. Among the lessons\n            learned, project design and policy implications outline the\n            project complexity, reflected by in-experiences in civil\n            works, and services, and failure to appropriately apply the\n            Bank's safeguard policies. Instead, a two-phase project\n            design could have better included less complex civil works\n            in the first phase, with a second phase including the\n            Asuncion ring-road, thus providing time for a thorough\n            preparation of the ring-road component. Moreover,\n            construction costs were underestimated in the design phase,\n            which lead to cost overruns; this could have been prevented\n            by preparing the engineering design studies prior to the\n            bidding process, to avoid construction delays. Project\n            implementation highlights the need to establish early on,\n            performance indicators, and key measurable institutional\n            indicators, to avoid difficulties in proposing timely\n            remedial measures, while organizational capacity should be\n            assessed prior to the start of project implementation. In\n            addition, the resettlement plan should be prepared well in\n            advance of project appraisal, to avoid delays due to a lack\n            of financial resources, institutional weakness, and poor\n            land tenure and registry systems. Finally, political\n            stability should be considered, to attain easy access to\n            decision making, and dialogue."}, "docdt": "2002-02-20T00:00:00Z"}
