outcomes were satisfactory, project\n            sustainability was likely, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: except for\n            improvements in the financial position of Water and Sewerage\n            Corporation (WSC) the project objectives have for the most\n            part been met. Improvements in management and operations\n            have been realized, there have been improvements in water\n            quality and reliability, leak detection and control program\n            is being systematically installed with meter replacement\n            underway, and improvements in the transport of water have\n            been successful. Nonetheless there have been some important\n            shortcomings in the project, which are reflected in the\n            following findings and lessons learned. Most of them focus\n            on financial issues facing WSC. One of the major findings\n            concerns the recent technological developments which have\n            been achieved in producing potable water from seawater by\n            Reverse Osmosis (RO). Many of the principal hotels, which\n            are large water consumers, have begun to explore alternative\n            water supply sources to ensure that their water supply needs\n            are met at a reasonable cost. With the growing viability of\n            the reverse-osmosis (RO) alternative, independent water\n            production has become competitive with existing services.\n            WSC's past inability to provide consistent, high\n            quality water at a reasonable price has resulted in a loss\n            of clients. To avoid further erosion of the hotel customer\n            base, WSC service to the remaining hotels will need to match\n            client expectations in terms of cost and service\n            reliability. More aggressive efforts to improve operational\n            efficiency by reducing continued high levels of Unaccounted\n            for Water (UFW) should, in turn, ensure a more consistent,\n            reliable and cost-effective supply of water."}, "docdt": "1996-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
