Water and Sewerage Corporation (WSC) in\n            the key areas of management and finance.  It also seeks to\n            promote system reliability and performance through the\n            rehabilitation of deteriorating facilities and by\n            improvements in their operation and maintenance.  To this\n            end, the project, to be carried out over eight years\n            supports several components.  They include water supply\n            rehabilitation, water importation improvements, sewerage\n            rehabilitation, acquisition of various equipment and a\n            comprehensive program of technical assistance and training.\n            Under the proposed project, increasing efficiency and cost\n            savings will accrue along with improved water quality, as\n            well as better water supply and sewerage service.  A\n            well-functioning water supply and sewerage system is vital\n            to the health of the population and of the tourism industry,\n            on which the economy of the Bahamas is critically dependent."}, "docdt": "1986-09-22T00:00:00Z"}
