                         component (=US$69.94million) exceeded the original allocations by about 6%. This 6% deficit will be covered from community contributions deposited in the Central Bank of Yemen.
                         The total allocation was used to finance 716 sub-projects (sp) estimated to cost US$80.50 million. 716 sub-projects were delivered and sector distribution of these sub-projects (sps):
                         20 sps in the health sector; education 378 sps; water supply 47 sps; sanitation 18 sps, roads/ stone paving 56 sps; agriculture/ water harvesting 187 sps and 10 sps in vocational &
                         social buildings. Investments made in the education sector continue to be the highest and amount to 51% of the total investment costs, indicating the high priority accorded to
                         education when compared to the other sectors. The second priority sector is the agriculture/water harvesting sector which has absorbed about 23% of the costs. Classrooms/
