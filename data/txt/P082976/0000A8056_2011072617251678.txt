                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall development objective would be to continue supporting the Borrower in the: (a) provision of needed infrastructure to improve services and
                         environmental conditions (particularly those affecting women and children); and (b) creation of short term employment. The Project would also seek to ensure
                         the sustainability of these measures through: (i) community involvement in project selection, preparation, and implementation; and (ii) the development of local
                         contracting and consulting firms.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Approximately 98.7% of the Credit has been disbursed. The Project was due to close on June 30, 2011, but due to the security situation in Yemen, the Bank approved a project
                         Restructuring (RP) extending the Project's closing date to June 30, 2012 (a copy of the RP is included). The extension is primarily due to the delay in the delivery of seven works
                         contracts and one goods contract for the supply of student combined seats for schools financed under the Project. The total amount of these contracts is US$1,622,921 out of which

                         US$733,149 has been disbursed. The delay is being caused by the current security and political environment in Yemen, and the remaining activities under these contracts are
                         expected to be completed as soon as the situation stabilizes.
