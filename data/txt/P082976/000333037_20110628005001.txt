                  Annex 3: Extension of Closing Date
              REPUBLIC OF YEMEN – THIRD PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT
                  P082976 Credit Nos. 38590-YEM and 44190-YEM

                                   Restructuring Paper

1.                                                                                         T
     he closing date for the Third Public Works Project, IDA Credit Nos. 38590-YEM and
     44190-YEM will be extended from June 30, 2011 until June 30, 2012.

2.                                                                                         U
     ntil the onset of the current country crisis, Project implementation was on track. The
     Project’s last two ISRs had rated both the Progress Towards Achieving PDO and
     Implementation Progress Satisfactory, and the Project was expected to close as
     planned on June 30, 2011, but due to the current political and security environment, a
     number of contracts (Works and Goods) amounting to approximately US$1.62
     million could not be delivered on time. The overall level of commitment for works
     contracts is currently at 100% of the total Credit amount, and by Project end, the
     actual achievement of objectives could potentially exceed the revised targets in key
     areas of job creation, provision of basic infrastructure, and development of local
     contractors and consulting firms.

3.                                                                                       T
     he proposed extension is thus necessary to complete seven works contracts and
     deliver one student combined seats contract for schools financed under the Project.
     These contracts are small in size, less than US$405,000 equivalent, and will be
     completed as soon as the security condition stabilizes.

4.                                                                                          T
     he original Credit - Third Public Works Project of SDR31.3 million (US$45 million
     equivalent) was approved on February 26, 2004, signed on April 23, 2004 and
     declared effective on July 15, 2004. The Closing Date was then extended from June
     30, 2009 to June 30, 2011 and an Additional Financing (AF) Credit for an amount of
     SDR18.8 million (US$29.84 million) was approved on April 22, 2008. The
     Additional Financing Agreement was signed on July 1, 2008, and declared effective
     on August 19, 2008. The Closing Date of both Credits was originally June 30, 2011.
     This would be the second closing date extension for the original project and the first
     for the Additional Financing.
