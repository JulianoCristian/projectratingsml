Yemen Third Public Works\n            project rated as follows: the overall outcome was\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            and both the bank and borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            There were five lessons learned: (1) Involving communities\n            in sub-project selection and design assured community\n            ownership and participation, which led to strong resilience\n            in the face of a volatile country situation.  (2) The PMU\n            proved to be highly useful, versatile and scalable project\n            delivery instrument, assuring continued adherence to\n            improved criteria and objectivity in selection. (3) M&E\n            has been developed to a high level of effectiveness through\n            continued incremental improvements over the three PWPs and a\n            specific focus on baselines and regular follow-up in the\n            field. (4) The sub-project selection, design, and tendering\n            process can be used to maximize employment and maintain low\n            investment and maintenance costs. (5) Long-term engagement\n            and incremental improvement to a strong design can lead to\n            improved sector performance."}, "docdt": "2012-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
