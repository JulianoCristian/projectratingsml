                         The overall development objective would be to continue supporting the Borrower in the: (a) provision of needed infrastructure to improve services and
                         environmental conditions (particularly those affecting women and children); and (b) creation of short term employment. The Project would also seek to ensure
                         the sustainability of these measures through: (i) community involvement in project selection, preparation, and implementation; and (ii) the development of local
                         contracting and consulting firms.
