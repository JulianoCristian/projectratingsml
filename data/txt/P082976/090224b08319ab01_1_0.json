Public Works Program, supported by\n            World Bank, has delivered 3,900 sub-projects, creating more\n            than 7.4 million jobs for Yemenis. As a result, in the\n            education sector, the enrollment of students increased\n            considerably. In the health sector, immunization increased\n            by 62 percent.
