The extension is\n            necessary to: (i) complete construction of three subprojects\n            in three participating ULGs; (ii) promote ULGs in\n            accelerating subproject operation; and (iii) ensure that all\n            reform indicators are fully achieved."}, "docdt": "2012-05-17T00:00:00Z"}
