I. Disbursement Profile
1.     Project Context, Development Objectives and Design:

1.1    Context at Appraisal:

At appraisal in 2005, Indonesia was in the midst of two fundamental changes of historical
dimension.

Trend to Urbanization. The first was a trend to urbanization, in line with worldwide
trends, that was transforming the country’s society from a predominantly rural one to a
predominantly urban one. Since 2011, Indonesia’s urban population has exceeded its
rural population. The trend towards urbanization had been quite steady for decades and
will almost certainly continue for several decades more. It puts an increasing strain on the
resources and management capabilities of urban local governments (ULGs) and will
continue to do so. All previous investments and capacity buildings efforts for ULGs have
not been able to keep pace with the increase in challenges.

Governance Reforms. The second change was the wave of governance reform that
swept through the country since 1998 and focused on democratization and
decentralization. Local governments were given substantially more responsibilities and
more authority. At the same time, the transparency of their operations, public
participation, and government accountability were to be enhanced significantly. These
changes were not as continuous and steady as the urbanization trend. In the initial
enthusiasm, legislation on decentralization was passed (i.e.. Laws 22 and 25 of 1999) that
turned out to have serious flaws which had to be corrected later (i.e. through Laws 32 and
33 of 2004).

These changes, their backgrounds, and their likely implications were discussed
extensively in the PAD.

Need to improve urban services. The continuous rapid growth of urban populations
had put a strain on urban infrastructure and urban services for decades, and ULGs have
not been able to clear the backlog, let alone provide for the longer-term future. With the
shift from a more autocratic style of governance to democratization, urban populations
became more vocal in demanding improvements from their ULGs. Before, during, and
after appraisal there was thus a great need to support them in making the necessary
investments and increasing their capacities across the whole spectrum of urban services
and urban infrastructure. Such support should continue earlier efforts and build upon their
results and experiences.

Previous Urban Projects. When this Project was appraised, a whole ‘family’ of urban
projects had just been phased out, namely the Integrated Urban Infrastructure
Development Projects (IUIDP, also known by their Indonesian abbreviation P3KT).
These had been conceived by the Department of Public Works (now Ministry of Public
Works), particularly its Directorate General for Human Settlements (known by its
Indonesian name “CiptaKarya”), and supported by foreign donors including the Bank.
Those projects were aimed primarily at physical improvements but also addressed local

                                             1
institutional development and revenue improvement. Many of the projects supported by
the Bank included some efforts towards local governance reforms, e. g. the introduction
of one-stop service units (Unit Pelayanan Terpadu – UPT) under the Second East Java
Urban Development Project (LN 40170), the introduction of procurement reforms under
the Bali Urban Infrastructure Project (LN 41550), or the development of innovative
approaches for participatory and community driven project planning under the Urban
Poverty Projects (CR 32100, LN 46640 and CR 36580). However, these efforts were part
of individual projects, lacked a common platform, and lacked a mechanism that would
systematically sustain and replicate the achievements made. The Municipal Innovations
Project (LN 4440-IND) explored further avenues to improve urban governance in various
ways.

With the onset of decentralization, GoI and the donor community were exploring new
ways to foster urban development. There was a need to address the urban development
and management agenda more emphatically, focusing on reforms of regulations,
procedures, actual governance practices, related capacity building, improved institutional
arrangements, and the creation of a platform for further reforms, besides addressing the
persistent bottlenecks in urban infrastructure and service delivery.

At appraisal, ULGs were facing a multitude of challenges. One field of challenges was
the need to substantially reform their governance practices vis-à-vis the established
practices of earlier decades. The other field was the need to continue upgrading and
improving a wide spectrum of urban infrastructure and urban services.

Bank Engagement. The Bank considered it vital to stay engaged with the Government of
Indonesia (GoI) and selected ULGs in addressing both fields of challenges, and it agreed
to support the Ministry of Public Works (then named Ministry of Settlements and
Regional Infrastructure) in a program that was to address both the reform agenda and the
need for improved urban services with a view to pioneering changes in ULGs. Having
been involved in Indonesia’s urban sector for around three decades, the Bank had
accumulated considerable sector knowledge and developed long-standing institutional
relationships with key stakeholders. Also, the Bank had been a strategic partner of GoI
during its decentralization program. It was only logical that these prior involvements
were continued, intensified, and developed beyond the Development Policy Loans that
continued the efforts of the IUIDP projects.

The Project was expected to contribute to the three main pillars of the then CAS, namely
(a) creating an enabling environment for productive investments, (b) enhancing the
provision of services to the public, especially for the benefit of the poor, and (c)
supporting further governance reform efforts.




                                            2
1.2      Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators:

Project Development Objective

      Assist the borrower in improving the provision of urban services by participating
      urban local governments (ULGs) and additional participating ULGs.

There were different but similar versions of the PDO in the PAD and the legal
agreements. The version above is from the Loan Agreement, but with the term “ULGs”
spelled out for clarity. This is considered the formal PDO for purposes of evaluation,
though the project’s early Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs) drew the
PDO statement from the PAD.

The PDO in the PAD differed mainly by (a) stating the objective as being improved
services in the ULGs rather than improved provision of services by the ULGs, (b) did not
specifically mention “additional participating” ULGs, and (c) included additional
information about the context and design of the project that were not intended to be a
formal part of the PDO, but did provide more insights into the governance objective. The
full PDO statement in the PAD Data Sheet was:

      The project’s principal development objective is to improve urban services in the
      participating urban local governments (ULG). This is the first step toward achieving
      the Government of Indonesia’s (GOI) long-term goal to develop self-reliant cities. To
      achieve this objective, the project focuses on reforming municipal governance,
      developing institutional capacity and financing priority urban investments.

The appraised project included 13 participating ULGs, but both the PAD and the legal
agreements anticipated that additional ULGs would join the project during
implementation, and defined procedures for this purpose.

Both versions of the PDO, in different ways, incorporated improved governance and
capacity as part of the strategy for improving services rather than explicitly defining it as
an objective. However, the project design and activities were clearly focused on
governance, and at approval “municipal governance and institution building” was the
single largest theme (50 percent) for the project financing at approval. While the Loan
Agreement’s shorter PDO statement eliminated the reference to governance, it also cited
provision of services by the ULGs, suggesting an emphasis on improved capacity to
provide services rather than direct improvement in services themselves. An even
lengthier version of the PDO in the main body of the PAD went on to state that:

      More specifically, the project will:
      (a) improve municipal governance through: (i) enhanced civic participation in key
          municipal decisions and monitoring/supervision of their implementation; (ii)
          adoption of extensive public information disclosure policies; and (iii) reform of
          procurement and financial management practices;


                                              3
   (b) strengthen municipal institutional capacity to formulate long-term urban
       development strategies and plans, including local economic development and
       urban poverty reduction strategies;
   (c) build municipal institutional capacity and professionalizing municipal managers
       and staff;
   (d) enhance fiscal capacity by rationalizing expenditures and increasing revenues;
   (e) finance priority urban investments; and
   (f) implement at the central level, the Urban Institutional Development Program
       (UIDP)for supporting urban reforms and institutional capacity building.

Four of the six specific project activities are related to ULGs’ governance and capacity,
and are stated in terms normally associated with outcomes rather than outputs. The only
specific activity related to the urban investments, by contrast, only describes the Bank’s
input (financing).

The Bank’s Quality Assessment Groups (QAG) conducted a Quality at Entry Assessment
(QEA7) of the project on July 28, 2005, soon after approval. Considerable attention was
devoted to the evolution of and “lack of clarity” about the project objectives prior to
approval, as well as disconnects in some parts of the PAD resulting from the late revision
of project design and its reappraisal. QAG took the position that the PDO no longer
captured the intended objectives of the project and, notwithstanding the PDO in the PAD
or Loan Agreement, assessed the project on the basis of two main objectives: (a)
institutional development/capacity building and (b) infrastructure development. In some
respects, QAG’s interpretation gave greater emphasis to infrastructure investments being
a means of helping to achieve the project’s governance/capacity objectives than vice
versa.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The only PDO-level indicator was “At least 10 ULGs improve priority urban services in
areas financed with USDRP support.”

This represented roughly three-quarters of the 13 ULGs identified as project participants
at the time of appraisal. The baselines and targets for measuring improved services in the
ULGs was not quantified in the Results Framework (RF), but rather would be defined in
the feasibility study of each subproject. The RF also included an intermediate indicator
for investments in services, which basically tracked progress in expenditures for
subprojects (and input) rather than outcomes or even outputs, strictly speaking.

Since governance was not explicitly captured as a PDO-level objective, the project’s five
governance indicators were considered intermediate or component-level indicators in the
original RF. Four of them related to urban reforms and institutional development that
would be achieved in at least 10 ULGs. The fifth set a goal for overall implementation of
the UIDP annual work plan by the national government (at least 75 percent
implementation of each year’s plan). The four indicators specific to the ULGs did not

                                            4
define clear standards for their achievement. Details are provided in Annex 2, but in
short, they covered:

         Public availability of information
         Public feedback mechanisms
         Participatory planning and public consultation
         Sound financial and procurement management practices

As with the indicator for service improvement, the targets for governance and capacity
were based on the number of participating ULGs (three-quarters) that would achieve the
goals, but the specific improvements and results were to be defined in the governance
reform action plans of each ULG.

1.3        Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification:

Revised PDO

      Assist the Borrower to strengthen local governance and improve the provision of
      selected urban services by participating ULGs and additional participating ULGs.

The PDO was formally revised in June 2010. The revised PDO mirrored the formulation
already used in the original Loan Agreement, but explicitly included strengthening local
governance as an objective. This change was made at the government’s request and was
in harmony with the Bank’s view as well. While governance was clearly a central
element in the project’s approach to improving services, and linkage between the two is a
widely understood and accepted principal in development, demonstrating the causal
effect, particularly within the lifetime of the project was not considered feasible.

Undertaking simultaneous investments in both services and governance was intended to
enhance project outcomes and long-term impacts in both these areas, but the project and
the RF was not designed to sequence these investments/activities or show that one was
achieved as a result of the other. Both the original and revised RF included indicators for
both services and governance, but not a way of measuring their interrelationship.

Expressly including governance an objective in the PDO better reflected the project
design and goals (see description of QAG’s assessment in Section 1.2) as well as the
government’s strategy and development priorities. It also made the outcomes more
monitorable and the indicators more relevant. Notably, this approach is also consistent
with the numerous Bank-financed projects that are part of the government’s ongoing,
flagship poverty-alleviation program, the National Program for Community
Empowerment (PNPM). Projects in the both PNPM Urban and PNPM Rural series have
adopted a common PDO focused on “improved socio-economic and local governance
conditions” as the main objectives.




                                              5
Revised Indicators

In the same restructuring that revised the PDO, substantial revisions were also made to
the indicators in the project RF. The primary goals were to (a) better reflect and measure
the PDO and intended project outcomes, (b) address the lack of specific, measureable,
and aggregate standards for improvement in services and governance for the project
overall (rather than outputs or results drawn from dozens of individual subproject
feasibility studies and ULG governance reform plans), and (c) better target the project’s
governance activities and results to reflect new developments in government regulatory
requirements and priorities, and sharpen outcome effectiveness based on the project’s
implementation experience to that point.

Since the number of participating ULGs changed as participants left and entered the
project, the numerical targets (10 ULGs) were replaced by percentage targets (70 percent
of participating ULGs). This reflected the original intent of the RF design based on the
success rate in participating ULGs, without tying the outcome target to a specific number
of ULGs.

Improved services. The single PDO indicator for improved services was replaced with
four new and more measurable indicators, each of which would be achieved by/in at least
70 percent of participating ULGs:
     Increased ULG local revenue by at least 10% due to the investment
     Increased ULG expenditures for O&M by at least 10%.
     At least half of the users of new facilities express increased satisfaction in doing
        business.
     At least half of the consumers express increased satisfaction in using the new
        facilities.

Governance. These revised indicators reflect the impact of the subprojects under
Component A. Although the governance indicators were not elevated to PDO level in the
RF, this was clearly the intention of the restructuring as reflected in the Restructuring
Paper, which explained that the revision was needed because “in their current
formulation, the PDO and indicators also fail to capture appropriate measures of
improved governance.”

The governance indicators are complex and many of the overall governance targets
contain multiple subsidiary outputs or requirements. Details are shown in the ICR Data
Sheet and in Annex. In summary, they set specific and measureable targets in the areas
of:

      Transparency, Participation, and Accountability
      Financial Management practices
      Procurement practices
      Establishment of a Provincial Center of Excellence to support governance reforms
      Development of Local Economic Development Strategies and City Development
       Strategies

                                            6
1.4    Main Beneficiaries:

The PAD does not explicitly identify primary or secondary target groups but it can be
considered implied that the two project components (see below) had two distinctly
different target audiences: By strengthening local governance, Component A was to
benefit directly the participating ULGs and indirectly other ULGs in the whole country
and, through them, their urban populations. This was to be achieved, both during and
after Project implementation, through the Urban Institutional Development Program
(UIDP). Component B was to benefit the urban population in participating ULGs,
especially the users of the new urban service facilities created under the project: market
traders, shoppers, fishermen, and users of bus terminals. They were to be the main
beneficiaries of the improved urban services provided in/by new facilities that the Project
would create, and this was reflected in the rephrasing of the PDO indicators on the
occasion of the Project Restructuring. As the intended beneficiaries of Component B
could be quite clearly identified, user satisfaction surveys were conducted in the Project
Benefit Monitoring & Evaluation (see Section 2.3 and Annex 5).

1.5    Original Components:

The project had separate components for Urban Reform and Urban Investments. They
were designed to be carried out in parallel so as to complement one another and
strengthen their respective outcomes as well as overall project results and the
sustainability of outcomes. This approach of carrying out governance and capacity
strengthening activities in tandem with tangible civil works activities is widely employed
in development projects, in part to strengthen the practical application of reforms during
their actual rollout and achievement of reform outcomes themselves. In this case, it also
served as part of the national government’s effort to develop and test different approaches
in its ambitious, longer-term decentralization strategy aimed at creating more self-reliant
cities that would progressively take on greater responsibility for local service delivery.

At approval 13 participating ULGs had been identified, with 18 subprojects scheduled for
implementation in the first two years of urban investments. To qualify for participation
the ULGs had to meet threshold criteria related to fiscal soundness, borrowing capacity,
investment needs as reflected in their development plans, and commitment to the
proposed governance reforms (see Annex 10). Arrangements were also made governing
the exit of participating ULGs that fell out of compliance with the conditions for ongoing
participation, as well as for the entry of new participating ULGs (if project resources
allowed). Local government commitment and ownership was also reflected in their cost-
sharing commitment, particularly for the urban investment component:

Component A: Urban Reform and Institutional Support (US$9.0 million). This
component included two separate subcomponents:

   Urban Institutional Development Program (UIDP) (US$6.9 million) to carry out
    activities aimed at improving the governance and capacity of the ULGs. This
    subcomponent was the primary mechanism for achieving the project’s governance
    improvement and reform goals.

   Project Implementation Support (US$2.1 million) to provide the technical assistance,
    consultants, equipment and training needed to enable the Central Project Management
    Unit (CPMU) to carry out the UIDP Subcomponent.

The urban reform programs supported by the UIDP were aimed and strengthening the
ULGs’ governance capacity and performance in several key areas: (a) core governance in
terms of civic participation, transparency, procurement, and financial management; (b)
long-term urban development strategies and plans, including local economic development
and urban poverty reduction strategies; and (c) institutional and capacity development
programs identified by the ULGs themselves, including professionalization of municipal
managers and staff as well as e-governance. Although the main focus of the project and
its resources was direct support to the ULGs, at the central level the UIDP was also
designed to help the government of Indonesia formulate national urban policies in key
strategic areas related to its overarching decentralization agenda, particularly urban
finance, poverty reduction and local economic development. In short, it intended to help
strengthening the enabling environment and legal/regulatory framework for
decentralization.

The inputs and activities through which the UIDP would achieve these outputs and
outcomes included financing of technical assistance to the ULGs and other stakeholders,
studies of that support the preparation of NUSPD and urban reform in ULGs, training,
equipment, workshops, and dissemination of the national and global knowledge and
experience on urban and governance reforms.

Component B: Urban Investment (US$52.1 million). The IBRD financing for
investments in local services was channeled through the Indonesian government to

                                              8
participating ULGs through subsidiary loan agreements (SLAs). When the project was
originally appraised, the design concept was for on-grants and on-lend to finance a broad
range of possible priority investments in local services, such as roads, bridges, water
supply, sewerage, solid waste management, and flood control. But later during project
preparation, the GoI decided to proceed with on-lend scheme only, which applied only
for direct-revenue generating investment.

However, the project design was adjusted and reappraised after the government required
that, in the case foreign financing passed on to local governments via a loan to the central
government, the local financing had to be in the form of on-lend rather than on-grants.
The new regulations also required that the services or investments thus financed be
revenue-generating, though not necessarily with full cost recovery. (See Annex 14 for
policy/regulatory details.) This effectively narrowed the range of investment options, and
by final appraisal the subproject proposals identified for the project mostly involved
rehabilitation and construction of public markets along with several transportation (bus)
terminals. Since these services involved leasing space to vendors or to private companies
or concessionaires, they met the requirement of generating revenues for the ULGs. This
is explained in more detail in Section 2.1.

1.6    Revised Components

In addition to revising the PDO and indicators, the June 2010 restructuring also
simplified and refocused the requirements of the Urban Reform Component in response
to changes in regulations, priorities, and needs, as well as the experience in
implementation to that point. For example, some requirements developed during project
preparation or at the initial stage of project implementation later became incompatible
with new regulations, were found to be less efficient or effective in improving
governance than alternative activities, or were already achieved by other activities within
USDRP or required by central government regulations.

These revisions did not change the basic design or substance of the component, but rather
fine-tuned the specific reform activities and requirements to give the project a more
relevant, narrowly targeted, and better defined set of reform activities to help achieve
more tangible and useful governance outcomes. They are reflected in the revised
indicators, which defined much more specific outputs and outcomes for the reform
component and corresponding governance objectives (see Annex 2).

1.7    Other significant changes:

Changes in Participating ULGs. Eight of the 13 ULGs that were expected to participate
at appraisal withdrew, for various reasons, e.g. change of leaders, inconsistent
commitments, change of local parliament, during the first three years of Project
implementation, but the participation of several other ULGs was considered, and five
other ULGs eventually came to participate in the Project several years after appraisal (see
Additional Annex 11for details).The newly participating ULGs were partly selected from



                                             9
the “queue” of those ULGs not selected during Project preparation, and partly from other
ULGs that had newly applied.

Extensions of Loan Closing Date. The originally envisaged loan closing date of June
30, 2011, was extended twice, the second time to May 31, 2013, i. e. by 23 months in
total. This was necessary for several reasons, including the unexpectedly long time
needed for the processing of the SLAs (e. g. because the documents submitted by ULGs
did not meet the required standards), and the time needed by the newly participating
ULGs to complete their subprojects under Component B.

Reallocation of Loan Funds. The Project Restructuring mentioned above (endorsed by
the Board) included a reallocation of loan funds. US$0.95million of previously
unallocated loan funds were allocated to the category “consultant services, training and
workshops” (expanded from the previous category “consultant services”).

Partial Loan Cancellations. Two amendments to the Loan Agreement (effective
December17, 2010, and December 27, 2012) reduced the loan amount from the original
US$45.00 million to approx. US$38.14 million. This was necessary because the number
of participating ULGs had decreased, the admission of additional ULGs was not feasible
under the time constraints, and the full original loan amount could thus not be absorbed.
There was also an internal reallocation of loan funds. A complete list of the seven
amendments made to the Loan Agreement is given in Additional Annex 12.

2.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

Background Analysis. The PAD contained a thorough analysis of the Project’s
background and environment as it was during preparation and described the rationale for
the Bank’s intervention. Basically, the analysis turned out to be sound and valid during
the Project implementation period but details of GoI’s decentralization policy and the
underpinning legal framework did change over time. This was one of the reasons for the
Project Restructuring described above.

Project Environment. The EA and the Bank team prepared the Project under
circumstances that had no precedent in Indonesia, namely an emphatic shift towards
democratization and decentralization. The scope and scale of this drive towards
democratization and decentralization was a novelty not only in Indonesia but almost
worldwide, and all stakeholders basically endeavored into uncharted territory. This
included the fact that new regulations, however carefully they might have been designed,
still had to stand the test of practical application, and nobody could tell in advance what
kind of adjustments might turn out to be necessary. Inevitably, government personnel
tasked with applying new regulations had no prior experience in handling them which
compounded the challenges. Therefore, the Project was designed with a high degree of
uncertainty that made it extremely difficult to fall back on earlier experiences or
anticipate accurately how the new policies and elements of legislation would be

                                            10
applicable or factually applied. During Project preparation, the uncertainties and risks
could not be assessed accurately, let alone mitigated.

Experiences from IUIDP Projects. The IUIDP Projects supported by the Bank all had a
regional focus, e. g. the Sulawesi Urban Development Project and the Kalimantan Urban
Development Project each covered four provinces on those islands, the Second East Java
UDP (SEJUDP) and the Bali Urban Infrastructure Project (BUIP) both covered the
respective provinces, the Semarang-Surakarta UDP covered two cities in Central Java,
and the Surabaya UDP focused entirely on the capital of East Java. This regional focus
enhanced the efficiency of project management considerably. The SEJUDP and the BUIP
supported the decentralization agenda by placing the main responsibility for project
management (including the relevant consultant teams) in the provincial governments,
thus enhancing their experience and developing their capacities with a view to bestowing
them with more project management authority in the future. Still, Cipta Karya was the
official central-level EA for both these projects.

The decentralization laws of 1999 (implemented since 2001) stripped provincial
governments of much of their erstwhile powers and limited them largely to the role of
coordinating the local governments which had been bestowed with much more authority.
Provincial governments could therefore not continue playing the prominent and
successful roles that had played in the SEJUDP and the BUIP; they had neither the
mandate nor the incentive nor the resources. Thus, it could not be expected that they
would play a prominent role in the implementation of the USDRP.

The IUIDPs did not select participating local governments through a demand-driven or
competitive process. For instance, all 35 local governments of East Java Province (except
Surabaya city) participated in the SEJUDP practically by default, having to provide
nothing more than a feasible subproject proposal. The USDRP set out to design an
innovative approach, and it did so by inviting all local governments of Indonesia to
compete for participation in the Project (see Additional Annex 10). This approach carried
some inherent risks that were evidently underestimated (see below).

Some revenue generating subprojects under the IUIDP program were financed through
SLAs, at that time mostly limited to the subsectors of water supply and solid waste
management. The finalization of those SLAs had always been very difficult and time
consuming but this experience was not thoroughly evaluated in the preparation of the
USDRP. Implicit hopes that these processes could be substantially shortened under the
USDRP turned out to be somewhat unrealistic.

Fund Channeling Options. The Project was appraised twice whereby the first appraisal
considered a channeling of loan funds to the participating ULGs either through on-
granting or through on-lending. By the time of the second appraisal GoI had formulated
the policy that all loan funds should be on-lent only, with the argument that all local
governments were already receiving considerable amounts of grant funding from central
government in the form of “General Allocation Funds” (Dana Alokasi Umum – DAU).
However, another local governance reform project implemented simultaneously with the

                                           11
USDRP (the Initiatives for Local Governance Reform Project – ILGR) was not restricted
to SLA funding.

The QALP-2 Assessment stated that project design was unduly complex as it
incorporated compulsory on-lending to ULGs. This requirement of compulsory on-
lending was brought into the preparation process by GoI rather emphatically; rejecting it
would have jeopardized project preparation and launch. In the PAD, the resulting risks of
delays may have been objectively misjudged.

Project Objective. The formulation of the Project objective, while highly relevant to the
agenda and priorities in the CAS, was not as clear as it could have been in defining the
project objectives (as reflected in the lengthy description in Section 1.2 and 1.3). The
QEA7 assessment, carried out shortly after approval, noted that the PDO tended “to
reflect the ambitious and grander objectives of the original project design rather than the
more modest goals of the re-designed project.” The PDO could be interpreted as
suggesting that the project would improve urban services broadly in the participating
ULGs, and would be a central part of the national government’s decentralization strategy.
The QEA7 assessment interpreted the actual objectives as being more narrowly targeted
at using selected investments in urban services as one tool in the effort to improve the
local governments’ governance and capacity to deliver services. While the project still
facilitated the larger decentralization dialogue with the GOI, achieving improved services
as a result of decentralization and better local governance was seen as a longer term
agenda. This emphasis on selected services and on governance as part of the objective
rather than a means toward achieving the higher level impact/outcome of improved urban
services broadly, was reflected in the formal revision of the PDO, which better matched
the project design and activities.

Despite some lack of clarity in the PDO and even in the government’s decentralization
strategy, there was strong government commitment to the principles of decentralization
and local governance reform, as well as to the project as a method for piloting one
mechanism and for achieving the governance outcomes and selected improvements in
services planned under the project. The objective clearly responded to the borrower’s
circumstances and development priorities, and it appeared realistic at the time of
appraisal although it was somewhat demanding especially on the participating ULGs.

Components. The two components together were highly suitable for achieving the
anticipated outcome especially if the outcome is interpreted as being wider than the
indicators that reflect it only to a limited degree. As discussed in more detail in Section
1.5 and other parts of the ICR, the project adopted an approach common to many
development projects of combining reform and capacity building activities in parallel
with infrastructure investments to enhance outputs and outcomes from both. While the
higher level goal is that better governance and capacity will yield improved local services
and, ultimately, more self-reliant cities, within the scope and time frame of the project,
the selected urban investments are as important as a mechanism to help achieve and
consolidate reforms (by giving a practical investment around which to apply the reforms)
as they are beneficiaries of those reforms. Or as stated in the PAD, “lending reinforces

                                            12
the reform process.” The Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA7) report echoed this concept
clearly as well.

It is difficult to capture this relationship between components in the Results Framework,
which tends to give the impression that the two components were entirely independent of
one another. However, as designed the two components together were highly suitable for
achieving the project objectives, notwithstanding the late changes in project design and
on-lending requirements. Though not sweeping in the range of services or associated
benefits they sought to improve, the investment subprojects addressed real and important
local service needs, and at the same time presented local governments with practical
applications for their planning, supervision, procurement, financial management,
participation, transparency, and accountability (governance reform) efforts.

Government Commitment. GoI was and still is very committed to the decentralization
and reform agenda, as evidenced by numerous bold steps it took, far beyond the design of
this Project. It is also very committed to improve its handling of the challenges of
urbanization. The commitment of participating ULGs appeared strong, too: they all had
come to participate in the Project on the basis of their own application, in a demand-
driven and competitive manner, and after a fairly rigorous selection process with defined
entry criteria (listed in Additional Annex 10). Even so, the commitment of ULGs was not
always consistent, evidenced by the fact that eight of them withdrew again from the
Project within the first three years of the implementation phase.

Executing Agency and Institutional Setup. The Directorate General Cipta Karya in the
Ministry of Public Works was selected as Executing Agency (EA). This was a logical
continuation of the long-standing and successful cooperation during the earlier IUIDP
projects (see above). However, the EA had neither the expertise nor the full mandate nor
the full range of required resources to guide and oversee comprehensive reforms in local
governance. Therefore, the Project limited the scope of such reforms to “core reforms”
that were considered relevant for projects within the sectoral interest of the EA, that were
related to earlier reform efforts (see Section 1.1). Further, the Project intended to
facilitate the creation of a platform for further future governance reforms by ULGs
themselves. Still, the EA felt at times over-burdened and overwhelmed by tasks that are,
strictly speaking, outside its mandate and responsibility. During project preparation, an
Inter-Ministerial Steering Committee (IMSC) was set up that guided and supported the
EA. Theoretically, one could have considered (or could consider for future operations of
this kind) the establishment of Project Implementation Units (PIUs) in several national
ministries. This, however, would increase the complexity of such a Project considerably.
- The Project planning documents list the organizational units that were expected to
handle Project implementation but in the initial stages of Project implementation there
was a considerable degree of ambiguity regarding the exact function of each unit (or type
of unit) and the expected interaction.

Co-financiers. Component A was co-financed by a PHRD grant from the Government
of Japan in the amount of US$5.00million. The PDO statement in the PHRD grant
agreement is the same as in the IBRD loan agreement.

                                            13
Risks and Risk Mitigation. The increasingly free and democratic nature of local
government elections resulted in a certain degree of unpredictability that had been less
pronounced under the more autocratic Soeharto administration. As a result, several ULGs
decided to discontinue the participation in the Project during the implementation phase
(see Additional Annex 11 for more details). To a certain extent, this is an inevitable risk
of democratization (which in turn was a cornerstone of governance reform) and happened
despite the very intensive communication and consultation with all interested ULGs
during Project preparation and despite the formal agreements that had been made with the
ULGs.

At appraisal, only one risk was rated as ‘Substantial’, namely: “Political commitment and
the limited capacity of participating ULGs to carry out reforms”. The corresponding
mitigation measure was, to select participating ULGs on the basis of their strong and
well-documented commitment to reform. Implicitly, this mitigation corresponded to a
lesson learned from the Kalimantan UDP, i. e. the enormous importance of the
commitment of local government leaders for the success of a project. However, this
approach turned out to be still insufficient to guarantee that such commitment would
continue to prevail throughout the Project implementation period. In some participating
ULGs local government priorities changed, e. g. after fresh elections.

Two other major conceptual risks are explicitly mentioned in the PAD, namely “political
interference in subproject approval process” and “Investment selection may not be
optimal”, and mitigation measure were specified.

The risks posed by insufficient capacity of ULGs appear to have been seriously
underestimated. Capacity limitations concerned not only political reforms (as identified)
but likewise, and even more so, preparation of the SLA, the implementation of
investment subprojects including the procurement of civil works and consultants and the
handling of fiduciary aspects. Professional capacities of staff varied between ULGs but
many of the participating ULGs had little, if any, experience or skills in managing Bank
funded subprojects, especially with regard to the various procurement, safeguards and the
fiduciary requirements. Political commitment alone is insufficient to compensate such
capacity limitations. The envisaged participating ULGs were scattered all over the
country, from Sumatra to Papua, far from one another and often in remote locations (see
map on the last page of this ICR). Provincial governments could no longer be relied on to
play a prominent role (see above).The burden of helping the ULGs overcome these
limitations thus fell back to the EA at the central level and to the Bank team. The impacts
of this were not fully considered in the Project design, and no adequate mitigation
strategy was formulated.

Further capacity limitations were encountered even at the national level during
implementation, as evidenced by the severe delays in the procurement of consultant
services. Thus, the mitigation measures for risk reduction appear to have been objectively
inadequate; much more emphasis should have been put on pro-active, emphatic efforts to



                                            14
overcome the capacity limitations at all levels, especially in a situation of imminent
comprehensive governance reform with the introduction of new procedures.

The required political commitment pertained not only to the implementation of
governance reforms but also to the willingness to adhere to previously made
commitments on borrowing, and in some cases this willingness was less consistent than
had been anticipated which resulted in ULGs withdrawing again from the Project (see
Additional Annex 11 for more details).

Conclusion. It appears the project was not sufficiently ready for implementation at loan
effectiveness, even besides the uncertainties mentioned above. The numerous risks
inherent in the project design had not been identified and addressed with the necessary
completeness. A shortcoming was that the procurement of critical TA was far behind the
schedule that would have been advisable (some ToR were extensively re-discussed and
revised until well into the third year of implementation). Also, the EA had established the
CPMU but had not been able to fully staff it as required.

All in all, quality at entry may have been less than satisfactory, as evidenced amongst
others by the withdrawal of eight envisaged ULGs (i. e. more than half) in the first three
years of Project implementation. The QALP-2 report rated the quality of design as
moderately unsatisfactory.

The QEA7 assessment rated overall quality at entry as moderately satisfactory and
readiness of the first year’s program for implementation as satisfactory. However, it only
rated Bank inputs and processes in preparation as moderately unsatisfactory. The higher
overall quality rating was due to the rating of satisfactory for most aspect of project
design (technical, financial and economic, environmental, fiduciary, policy and
institutional, and risk assessment). However, with the benefit of observing the project’s
actual implementation experience, both QALP-2 and the ICR identified greater
shortcomings in project design, risk assessment, capacity, institutional arrangements, and
readiness that were not as apparent at the time of the QEA7.

2.2    Implementation(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review,
Project at Risk status, and actions taken, as applicable):

Dynamic Project Environment. The Project was implemented in a rather dynamic
environment. On the one hand, ULGs were not always able to implement the reform and
enhancement agenda they had set out for themselves with the speed and completeness
that had been intended. In fact, as mentioned above, some ULGs were not consistent in
their commitment to the Project. On the other hand, national-level entities (both
parliament and government) issued more and more new legislation pertaining to the
reform agenda. Additional Annex 14 lists some of the major elements that had an impact
on the Project.

Institutional Arrangements. Prior to Project implementation, a Central Project
Management Unit (CPMU) was formed within the EA, and Project Management Units

                                            15
(PMUs) as well as Project Implementation Units (PIUs) within participating ULGs. The
PMUs were typically units in the local development planning boards (Bappeda) but the
PIUs were mostly in the local public works offices (Dinas PU). The Loan Agreement
stipulated the formation of Provincial Project Management Units (PPMU) in five
provinces but it was agreed in 2007 that a PPMU would be formed only in South
Sulawesi Province. Initially, there was insufficient clarity regarding the exact roles of
these units and the exact modalities of their interaction. However, during Project
implementation, the EA clarified these ambiguities through a Decision of the Director
General issued in June 2009 which achieved a marked improvement in the effectiveness
of these institutional arrangements. In addition, the EA strengthened the CPMU
considerably by deploying several full-time staff members including a full-time executive
officer (pelaksana harian).

Processing of SLAs and Release of SLA Funds. One main problem during
implementation was that the processing of the SLAs turned out to be a very protracted
process, much more so than had been expected. Reasons for this included:
    participating ULGs first had to either repay or reschedule their outstanding debts
       to central government,
    feasibility studies and other documents submitted by ULGs often failed to meet
       the required standards and had to be improved repeatedly (ULGs had no prior
       experience in preparing such documents and took some time to fully comprehend
       the procedures and related documents),
    the government changed the modality for processing the SLA requests by
       replacing a crucial piece of legislation (code-named KMK35/2003) by another
       one (code-named PMK53/2006) that came into force right after the start of the
       Project and tightened the requirements.

Another factor of substantial impact and beyond the control of GoI was that national
parliament (DPR) demanded, unexpectedly towards the end of the implementation phase,
that each individual SLA should be subject to parliament’s endorsement and the
respective allocations in GoI’s annual budget (“DIPA”) be vetted by parliament. This
affected specifically the ULGs Banda Aceh, Sawahlunto, and Morowali that had joined
the Project in 2010 only.

To optimize the relative timing of applying for funding and initiating procurement was a
major challenge for the implementing agencies, i. e. the participating ULGs, particularly
Banda Aceh, Sawahlunto, and Morowali. To the extent possible, these issues were
mitigated by intensified communication with parliament.

Delays in the processing of SLAs were not limited to this Project but were a generic
problem of several other, similar projects as well which prompted the Bank to seek a
dialogue with GoI on this issue.

Capacity Limitations. Capacity limitations at local governments hampered
implementation, and the disbursement speed anticipated in the PAD was unattainable.
This problem comprised three facets: (i) professional capacities had chronically been

                                           16
weak, and staff were almost totally inexperienced in handling foreign-funded projects,
especially in local governments; (ii) already being weak, local governments faced a
comprehensive set of new regulations they were very unfamiliar with; substantial time
had to be devoted to just studying new regulations and gauging what degree of authority
and discretion they gave to local governments; (iii) the governance reform efforts from
1999 onward included an emphatic drive against corruption and malfeasance, sometimes
to the extent that even minor administrative errors were construed as deliberate
mismanagement; this instilled a feeling of insecurity and fear among civil servants and
discouraged them from being pro-active and taking bold action.

This phenomenon became very relevant in the field of procurement. Initially, subproject
managers strictly followed the regulation that procurement must not be initiated before
the required funds have been approved and are available. In other words, the instruments
available under ‘advance action’ were not used. It was a breakthrough when the EA
decided that such ‘advance action’ would be permissible whereby procurement could be
initiated and implemented to the point that draft contracts had been negotiated and were
ready for signing by the time the required budget documents became available.
Considerable efforts in hands-on training were required to equip ULG staff with the
necessary skills.

Project implementation was also slowed down considerably by the severe delay in the
procurement of technical assistance packages. Even more than three years after loan
effectiveness, the EA had not procured all required consultant services. A main reason for
this slow progress was the insufficient staff time initially available in the CPMU which
was corrected by the EA as describe above.

Implementation Progress. As a result of the difficulties mentioned above, the speed and
effectiveness of project implementation was much less than had been anticipated.
Implementation progress was rated as satisfactory in 2006, moderately satisfactory in
2007, and moderately unsatisfactory throughout 2008 and 2009. The Project was
classified as a Problem Project in FY2010. From 2010 onward, however, implementation
progress was rated as moderately satisfactory again.

Mitigation Efforts. The EA, with support from the Bank team, made substantial efforts
to address the various hindrances to the smooth implementation of the Project, especially
by refocusing and intensifying its own supervision efforts very substantially. In more or
less monthly intervals, all participating ULGs were visited, guided, supported and
supervised as needed, with particular emphasis on the monitoring of implementation
progress (both of governance reform measures and investment subprojects) and
adherence to safeguards (environmental, social, and fiduciary). Additional inputs from
the Bank team were also made available to address the multitude of challenges.

Mid Term Review. A Mid-Term Review of the Project, simultaneously Supervision
Mission #7,was conducted from March to June 2009. It came to the conclusion that the
Project was making acceptable progress towards achieving the PDO and that
implementation progress could be rated as moderately satisfactory again, because (a) the

                                           17
EA had managed to speed up the procurement of technical assistance and (b) the
participating ULGs were making good progress with the governance reform efforts
(Component A) and had speeded up the implementation of their physical subprojects
(Component B), all with emphatic guidance and support from both the EA and the Bank
team. The EA, with the support of the MoF and the National Development Planning
Board (Bappenas), had committed to accelerate project processing by shortening
subproject review procedures and SLA processing and by assisting the participating
ULGs in expediting the procurement process. Still, an extension of the loan closing date
was deemed indispensable.

Project Restructurings. Thereupon, a first formal Project Restructuring was requested
by the EA in August 2009; it became effective in June 2010 (see also section 1.3). This
restructuring had a very positive effect on Project implementation because it gave the
participating ULGs a better sense of the direction and intended results of the Project
which enhanced political commitment and made relevant Project staff work in a more
focused manner. Three more formal Project restructurings were effected in 2011 and
2012 with the following adjustments:
     February 2011: partial cancellation of the loan amount (by US$6,565,000);
     May 2012: extension of loan closing date from June 30, 2012, to May 31, 2013,
        and simplification of one of the three performance indicators for procurement
        reform;
     November 2012: partial cancellation of the loan amount (by approx.
        US$294,000).
A complete compilation of all amendments to the Loan Agreement is given in Additional
Annex 12.

Continued Mitigation Efforts. After the Mid-Term Review and the Loan Restructuring,
sectoral national-level ministries (notably those for Home Affairs, for Trade, and for
Transport) were involved more intensively, bearing in mind that most subprojects under
Component B were markets and a bus terminal. The mitigation efforts mentioned above
were continued and intensified, e. g. through the deployment of consultants to directly to
participating ULGs and more focused guidance and monitoring. Systematic capacity
building and training efforts were initiated, tailored to the critical needs of the ULGs (as
identified through M&E, see Section 2.3). Where deemed beneficial, private sector
entities were contracted to provide professional training on modern commercial
management techniques for markets. Lastly, ULGs were enabled and encouraged to use
advance procurement (see above).

Implementation Efficiency. Implementation management efficiency for the
implementation of the whole Project was reduced by several factors or developments,
some of which were outside the control of project management; these were primarily:
(i) the unexpected withdrawal of eight ULGs (of 13 listed in the PAD) from the Project;
(ii) the unexpected difficulties and delays in getting the SLAs approved and the funds
made available to participating ULGs; (iii) the substantial efforts needed to process the
admission of additional ULGs to the Project. The high turnover in the participation of
ULGs may have been caused by insufficient incentives (or disincentives). In any case, it

                                            18
burdened the Project management entities (including the Bank team) very seriously as the
preparations for the possible joining of additional ULGs had to be done in parallel with
the implementation of the ongoing subprojects and activities.

There was also a trade-off between regional coverage and implementation management
efficiency. The Project had been designed to be open to any interested ULG from
anywhere within Indonesia, and the eventually participating ULGs were scattered over a
huge area several thousand kilometers across, with the result that each supervision
mission had to be broken down into several submissions that altogether took several
weeks to complete on each occasion. Similarly, support through consultants, as well as
meetings of participating ULGs (for coordination, exchange of experiences,
training/capacity building, and mutual support) were very time and resource consuming.

2.3      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E), Design, Implementation and Utilization:

Design

Planned Institutional Set-up. The Project design, as outlined in the PAD, envisaged that
M&E would take place both horizontally and vertically. Horizontally, the progress at the
ULGs was to be monitored by the local stakeholders through the local DPRDs and Urban
Forums. Vertically, the Provincial Project Management Units (PPMUs) within provincial
Bappedas were to monitor implementation progress of ULGs within their domain on the
basis of reports prepared by the PMUs (using information received from the PIUs) and
report the results to the relevant entities at the national level (CPMU, CPFO and CPMO).
It was surmised that most provincial Bappedas had prior experience with Bank projects,
especially IUIDP projects, and thus some M&E capacity already existed within those
agencies. Where required, additional capacity support was to be provided under the
Project. CPMU and CPMO were to constantly monitor and evaluate outcomes and results
of all participating ULGs and report their findings to the IMSC (as the national-level
coordinating unit for policy matters) and the Bank.

The indicators in the original Results Framework (RF) were appropriately linked to the
project objectives, but while they included targets for the number of ULGs to meet
certain goals, it did not provide specific or quantifiable measures for what constituted
achievement of the goal. For example, saying that at least 10 ULGs would have
“improved services” or “greater public availability of information,” but without defining
how they would be measured, or what constituted satisfactory improvement (this was
addressed during implementation through formal revision of the indicators).

Implementation

Actual Institutional Set-up. During project implementation, there was no CPFO nor
CPMO involved. Instead, all M&E related work at the national level was done by the
CPMU. A provincial-level PPMU was established only in South Sulawesi Province
where it played, to some degree, a coordinating and consolidating role between the local
and the national level. Effectively, the main interaction in terms of M&E and pertinent

                                           19
information exchange took place between the PMUs and the CPMU. In the initial stages
of Project implementation, the frequency and quality of reporting from the local level was
very poor on the grounds of insufficient institutional capacities and the absence of
supporting consultants. The situation improved after the deployment of “bridging
consultants”.

M&E Procedures. Beginning 2009, CPMU tightened and improved the Project
implementation monitoring which gathered full momentum in 2010. Participating ULGs
were required to report monthly on project implementation progress and raise crucial
issues immediately (i. e. independently from the regular reporting schedule). In addition,
ULGs had to furnish more comprehensive quarterly and semi-annual M&E reports to
CPMU. CPMU also launched a dedicated interactive website through which participating
ULGs could upload relevant information/documents. Field visits by project staff, Bank
staff, and/or consultants as well as regular meetings of ULG staff were further
instruments to improve and expedite the information flow and facilitate rapid responses
to issues as they arose. These procedures turned out to be adequate and effective.

Revision of Indicators. To address the lack of objective or monitorable standards for
achievement of the indicators (mentioned in the previous section), the June 2010
restructuring defined more specific activities, outputs, and outcomes through which the
indicators would measure improvement of services and governance reform. In the case of
the governance indicators, this included better tailoring the specific reform elements to
the needs, priorities, and capacities of the ULGs, as well as to changes in the legal and
regulatory framework within Indonesia. Section 1.3 includes additional discussion of the
revised indicators.

Utilization

The CPMU used the information thus gained to report as necessary to the MoF, the
special cross-project unit (called the UP2HLN) within the EA for monitoring foreign-
funded projects, the IMSC, and the Bank. Apart from reporting, the CPMU also used the
information to extend written guidance and advice to the concerned ULGs (copied to the
Bank team). Furthermore, the CPMU used the M&E findings to identify capacity
weaknesses and design necessary capacity building measures. The M&E was also
important in helping assess the relevance, feasibility, and effectiveness of various
requirements in the urban reform component (as well as weaknesses in the indicators
themselves) so that the June 2010 restructuring would help the project achieve better
reform outcomes and also measure them more clearly. The IMSC used the M&E findings
not only for its own information but also to help in decision making about the project (for
example, the M&E reflecting the slow pace of preparation efforts by the ULG of Solok
Selatan was instrumental to the decision to not include it in the project).

Project Benefit Monitoring & Evaluation. A Project Benefit Monitoring & Evaluation
(PBME) exercise was conducted before the end of the Project (see section 3.6 below).




                                            20
2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance:

The project design did not include elements with extraordinary safeguards or fiduciary
challenges. The handling of safeguards and fiduciary requirements was intensively
monitored during all supervision missions and mostly found to be satisfactory or
moderately satisfactory. No waivers from standard Bank policies were required.
Safeguards compliance was never rated lower than moderately satisfactory and while
there were some challenges and delays, the project went to considerable lengths to ensure
compliance with Bank and safeguards policies and project-specific requirements.

Social Safeguards Compliance. In the subprojects that focused on
construction/reconstruction of markets, the main issue was the relocation of market
traders, either to new markets at a different site, or to temporary markets and then back in
the case of markets that had to be vacated while being rehabilitated or reconstructed on
the same site. In all cases the available trading space had to be allocated through a fair,
unbiased, and transparent procedure, and traders had to be moved without unduly
comprising the interests of others. For all new facilities (including the bus terminal in
Parigi Moutong and the fish auction market in Morowali) there was a need to agree with
users on applicable tariffs (e.g. shop rents) and other aspects of sustained operation,
management, and maintenance. Participating ULGs formed special relocation teams as
well as separate monitoring teams, mostly for handling the moving of traders after
transparent and participatory planning processes. Most of these teams discharged of their
duties very well, which is especially remarkable in Pare-pare where a big market for
around 1,800 traders was constructed. All in all, around 8,000 traders were involved in
the relocation to the temporary markets and to the newly rebuilt markets.

At project closing the process of moving the vendors back into the markets was not
completed at many of the sites (as reflected in the Results Framework and in Annex 2).
This was mainly due to the later than expected completion of the facilities. However, all
negotiations and arrangements for the relocation into the markets had already been
finalized and the delay did not in itself involve any compromise in safeguards compliance
or performance. Although ensuring proper consultation, relocation arrangements,
transparency, and fairness sometimes contributed to the delays, ultimately this helped
ensure compliance and equitable outcomes.

Environmental Safeguards Compliance. The management and monitoring of
environmental issues (Environmental Management Plan-Environmental Monitoring Plan
or UKL and UPL by their Indonesian abbreviations) was taken very seriously by the
participating ULGs: their implementation had been made an obligation of contractors,
and the construction supervision consultants had been tasked with monitoring the
contractors’ adherence to these obligations on behalf of the ULGs. Quality and
compliance monitoring helped effectively identify and quickly correct shortcomings,
such as installing waste water treatment facility in the market in Palangkaraya to address
the issue of wastes from the market zone selling pork meat. Apart from the regular advice
during supervision missions, relevant ULG staff (mostly from the environmental offices
– Bappedalda) were also given formal training through a workshop so that they could

                                            21
competently oversee these processes. Remarkably, ULGs continued to report on the UKL
and UPL efforts until well after the completion of their physical subprojects.

Fiduciary Compliance. In the early stages of the project there were some moderate
shortcomings in financial management performance, and for about a year FM was rated
moderately unsatisfactory (May 2007 to August 2008). However, over time, and with
external assistance, performance improved and the ULGs managed to meet the required
compliance standards. Procurement plans were updated regularly, and contracts were
awarded timely. The CPMU was responsive to suggestions from the Bank team during
the procurement processes. Financial reports were submitted in a timely fashion and with
sufficient quality. Submission of the audit reports was also timely, there were no
qualified opinions, and all audit findings were addressed promptly.

2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase:

Commitments of ULGs. In the context of designing their exit and follow-up strategies,
all participating ULGs have signed formal MoUs with the EA, committing themselves to
complete any uncompleted activities (for instance, paving the parking lots and installing
electricity) that had been planned to be financed by their local budget (APBD) such as the
case of Sawahlunto, and sustain the achievements of the project. Continuous monitoring
by the EA and the relevant sector ministries shall support and facilitate this commitment.

Urban Reform (Component A). In all participating ULGs it is clear which
administrative unit is responsible for continuing the activities and sustaining the
achievements of the governance reforms in Component A and its mutually supportive
elements of (a) clear and binding regulations, (b) an institutional set-up conducive to
good governance, and (c) well-established actual practices. The ULGs have also
identified the specific staff in charge of this responsibility. The sustaining and
continuation of governance reforms is further facilitated by legislation and supervision
from the national government, and by the pressure of increasingly public demand for
better governance and transparency. None of the achieved reforms will burden the ULGs
with disproportionate additional expenditure, and it can thus be expected that the
necessary activities (e. g. the maintenance of the respective websites) will be undertaken
and continued. Budget for the implementation of the integrated Local Economic
Development / City Development Strategies has also been set aside.

Urban Investments (Component B). All participating ULGs have formally tasked an
institutional entity with managing, operating, and maintaining the assets created under
Component B. In several cases (e.g., Palangkaraya and Morowali) it is a sector agency of
the ULG, such as “Dinas Pasar” for markets or “Dinas Perikanan” for the fish auction
market. In other cases (e.g., Sawahlunto and Pare-pare) it is a technical service unit of the
ULG (Indonesian abbreviation UPTD) or a semi-independent service unit of the ULG (as
in Banda Aceh). In Palopo, the management of the market, including O&M, has been
outsourced to a private-sector entity. See Annex 2 for more details. All ULGs are
expected to gradually provide adequate budget for sustained O&M of their subprojects,
and budget allocations are expected to be much higher than previously.

                                             22
Backstopping Support. In each province of Indonesia, the EA has established a
Settlements and Buildings Development Information Center (PIP2B) to provide
backstopping support for the province’s ULGs particularly as an information center in the
province. In addition, several of these provincial PIP2B have been earmarked to function
nationwide as “centers of excellence” with a specific focus area in a particular field, e.g.
PIP2B in the Bali province is given a role as a “center for cultural building and heritage”;
PIP2B in Yogyakarta province as a “center for disaster management”. In this context, the
PIP2B in South Sulawesi Province is to function as the Center of Excellence for Urban
Management for all ULGs in Indonesia.

Incentives. To encourage and support participating ULGs in continuing the efforts they
had launched under the project, sustaining governance reforms, preserving and further
developing institutional capacity, and operating and maintaining the newly created
physical assets, the EA intends to allocate “incentive projects” for 2014 and 2015 to
ULGs that show effective efforts. The scope of such projects is to remain limited to the
sectors for which the EA is genuinely responsible. Incentive projects will be implemented
upon specific proposals from ULGs, provided they are consistent with the Medium Term
Investment Development Plan (RPIJM) of the respective ULG.

Longer-Term Nationwide Follow-Up. The IMSC has committed to continue the
initiatives and activities that have been implemented in USDRP with some strengthening
in participating ULGs and, more importantly, in other ULGs. Experiences and lessons
learned from the project, particularly from activities implemented at the ULG level,
should be used for further strengthening and improvement of the achieved KPIs and also
expansion in other ULGs. Ministries represented in the IMSC, such as the Ministries of
Finance, Home Affairs, or Trade, as well as the Government Procurement Policy Agency
(LKPP), are expected to continue supporting ULGs in reforms pertaining to transparency,
participation, and accountability, financial management reform, procurement reforms as
well as subproject (especially market) management improvement, as relevant to their
mandates. Lessons learned and experiences made in local reforms should be considered
in future national regulations. Another project output was support to the preparation of
Indonesia’s National Urban Strategy and Policy Development (NUSPD, or KSPPN by its
Indonesian abbreviation) by Bappenas. This comprehensive policy document is being
specified further in National Urban Development Programs (NUDP) that is meant to lay
the groundwork for future urban development projects. The Bank continues to support
these efforts.

Upscaling. The USDRP was meant to be a first step (as stated in the PAD) in achieving
the GoI’s long-term goal to develop self-reliant cities. The project was not immediately
replicated or expanded in a similar manner, though, for the following reasons: (a) GoI
found it more adequate to articulate the NUSPD mentioned above as the next step, and it
intends to formulate plans for follow-on projects on the basis of a widely accepted
NUSPD, and (b) the mechanism of channeling funds to ULGs through SLAs has been
found to be somewhat impractical, and better alternatives should be explored for future,
similar projects with more participating ULGs (see also Chapter 6, “Lesson Learned” #7).

                                            23
3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation:

Relevance to Country Priorities. The Project was considered relevant at appraisal as
well as at project completion (and throughout implementation). The QALP-2 Report
rated “strategic relevance and appropriateness of objectives” as Satisfactory, but rated
overall “strategic relevance and approach” (encompassing design as well as objectives)
only as Moderately Satisfactory. The earlier QEA7 report also rated overall strategic
relevance and approach as MS, but rated relevance of objectives as MS rather than S,
partly due to lack of consistency of the PDO statement relative to the redesigned project,
and uncertainties about the government’s evolving consensus on its own strategy.

The trend to urbanization and calls for governance reforms (see Section 1.1) continued to
challenge the capacities of ULGs, and it continued to be appropriate to support them
through the mechanism and implementation arrangements identified during project
preparation. Through the Project Restructuring, the KPIs became clearer and more
relevant, especially in the context of the national governance agenda, well reconciled and
synchronized with national policies. The revision of indicators, along with the revision to
the PDO also largely addressed the shortcomings identified in the QEA7 report, in effect
correcting the PDO (rather than changing the objectives). As the outputs and outcomes
pertain to local governments they also support Indonesia’s longer-term decentralization
agenda and help pave the way for self-reliant cities to emerge, as the PAD envisages.

Relevance to CAS/CPS. The Project contributed to the implementation of the CAS valid
at appraisal by (a) helping improve the investment climate and facilitating further
investments, (b) helping improve the provision of services to the poor, and (c) supporting
governance reforms.
     The Project investments in markets have leveraged additional investments in four
        ULGs: in Palopo (private sector investment), in Sawahlunto and Pare-pare (local
        government investment), and in Sidenreng Rappang and Banda Aceh (national
        government investments);
     The Project investments have been designed and implemented so as to provide
        opportunities for small/poor traders, including women, in numerous markets and
        to provide service and business opportunities to fishermen (many of whom are
        poor) in Morowali;
     Component A was specifically designed and implemented to help reform local
        governance.
The Project is also highly relevant for the CPS valid at ICR (it supports directly the
principles “Pro Growth”, “Pro Jobs”, and “Pro Poor”). The trading sector contributes
approx. 15% to the GDP.




                                            24
3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Achievement of PDO

Definition of Objectives

As reflected in the revised PDO, the project’s two principal objectives are to (a)
strengthen local governance and (b) improve provision of selected urban services by the
participating ULGs.

While this seems straightforward, to better frame the discussion of achievement of the
project objectives, it is worth providing further clarification or their origins, as reflected
in the lengthy explanation in Sections 1.2, 1.3, and other parts of the ICR. The original
definition of objectives was complicated by the change in project design in the late stages
of appraisal, inconsistent versions of the PDO statement between the Loan Agreement
and the PAD as well as within the PAD itself, and the failure of the original PDO to
properly capture the project’s intended objectives after the redesign (as highlighted in the
QEA7 report conducted shortly after approval).

In short, the ICR adopts the conclusion of the QEA7 report, which determined that the
project’s two objectives, even prior to formal revision of the PDO, were institutional
development/capacity building and infrastructure development. These were selected from
a set list of QEA options, and in the more open formulation of the project they would
correspond to governance/urban reform and improvement in selected services financed
by the project. In some respects, the QEA7 analysis tended to emphasize the role of the
infrastructure investments in helping to facilitate the governance reforms more than the
role of the reforms in improving services (within the context and timeframe of the
project).

Though not based directly on the QEA7 report, the June 2010 restructuring that formally
revised the PDO essentially came to the same conclusion, explicitly restoring governance
as an objective in the PDO, and qualifying improvement in services to be limited to
“selected” services (i.e. those financing by the project). This is also consistent with the
project’s theme codes, which counted municipal governance and institutional capacity as
accounting for 50 percent of the project thematic focus. In the revised PDO formulation,
while the improved services are an objective in themselves, they are also a reflection of
the ULGs’ capacity to provide services since achieving or documenting broad
improvement in local services is beyond the scope of the project.

In this sense, the revised PDO should be considered more a correction of the PDO rather
than a change in the project’s objectives. Also, while the revised governance indicators
were not “promoted” to PDO-level in the results framework, it was clearly the intention
of the restructuring that these indicators be used to assess achievement of the governance
objective. This simple oversight does not change the proper role of the indicators in
assessing achievement of the governance objectives.



                                             25
Furthermore, by focusing more specifically on the project’s local outcomes, the revised
PDO defined objectives that were more attributable, monitorable, and consistent with the
actual project design. As stated in the QEA7, the approved PDO tended to “reflect the
grander objectives of the original project design rather than the more modest goals of the
re-designed project.”

The passages in the lengthier version of the PDO from the PAD had implicitly linked the
project objectives to the higher level impacts of broad improvements in local services,
implementation of the overall decentralization goals, and long-term self-reliance of cities
that were not achievable or attributable to a short-term investment, including
demonstration of the causal linkage between better governance and improved services.
Although this relationship was an underlying assumption of the project design, and
indeed of Indonesia’s decentralization and service improvement strategy, the project’s
objective was to achieve the more immediate first step of improving capacity to deliver
services.

Governance

Achievement of the project’s governance objective was very strong, as measured by the
indicators for Component A (Urban Reform and Institutional Support). Although the
results varied between ULGs, overall the ULGs met or exceeded the clear and detailed
targets in all the indicators for improving performance in the areas of:

      Transparency, Participation, and Accountability
      Financial Management practices
      Procurement practices
      Establishment of a Provincial Center of Excellence to support governance reforms
      Development of Local Economic Development Strategies and City Development
       Strategies

These results have had positive impacts in terms of public service delivery beyond the
specific infrastructure investments financed by the project. They have also contributed to
the national program on strengthening local governance and capacity by demonstrating
the ULGs ability to implement such reforms and modeling one approach for doing so (see
explanation below bullets #3 and 4). The project also supported the broader national
agenda by establishing a regional Center of Excellence (PIP2B) to assist ULGs in their
reform efforts, and by supporting preparation of Indonesia’s National Urban Strategy and
Policy Development (NUSPD/KSPPN) by Bappenas.

Following are some specific examples of the results for selected indicators (full details
are in the results framework in the Data Sheet and in Annex 2):

      Transparency and disclosure of planning documents and procurement plans
       through websites (on average 90% of the ULGs have achieved this indicator as
       compared to the target of 80%) has led to better program implementation and
       promote a more timely and competitive procurement.

                                            26
      Public feedback mechanisms (almost 100% of ULGs achieved this indicator as
       compared to the target of 80%) have speeded up the response to complaints and
       promoted better performance of local agencies in service delivery.
      Adoption of various local regulations on financial management (100% of the
       ULGs have achieved the results indicators of the target 80%) has contributed
       better financial management and reporting which are part of the National Public
       Financial Management Reform.
      Establishment of a procurement service unit and adoption of electronic
       procurement system (ULP and LPSE, respectively, —this is beyond the KPIs) in
       all ULGs has led to improved budget and staff efficiency and increased budget
       management and saving; the Project has promoted the establishment of ULP in
       advance of the requirements of the national regulation on procurement.
      Creation of Local Economic Development (LED) plans and/or City Development
       Strategies (CDS) by the ULGs (100% ULGs have prepared LED Strategy as
       compared to the target of 60%) has increased dialogues between ULGs and the
       private sector and improved the synergy among local agencies in budgeting to
       achieve the shared objectives.

Provision of Selected Urban Services

Achievement of this objective is captured by the four formally designated PDO indicators
in the results framework. While these outcomes are most directly linked to the
infrastructure investments financed under Component B, their significance is not only the
benefits and services they provide directly, but also the performance and capacity of the
ULGs that is reflected in satisfactory completion of the investments, and can be expected
to be applied to provision of other services in the longer term.

At project closing (May 2013) all of the investment subprojects had been successfully
completed, without significant shortcomings in construction quality, and in full
compliance with environmental and social safeguards. However, due to the continuing
process of relocating all the vendors into the new facilities, at ICR only five were
considered fully operational (i.e., fully occupied), another five were partially occupied,
and five were still unoccupied.

In addition, since some facilities were completed only shortly before closing and most
were not fully operational yet, indicators for revenue are obtained from subprojects that
are used or in operation, and for operations and maintenance (O&M) are measured
directly based on actual costs spent to maintain the markets (for those that have not been
used, some ULGs still allocate and spend some budget to maintain the buildings and
utilities). Satisfaction rates include results for both fully and partially occupied facilities.

Though not yet reflecting the full outcomes of the project, one of the four indicators had
been fully achieved at closing, while the other three had been partially achieved, and all
are expected to be achieved once they are fully occupied again. For each indicator, the
target is for 70 percent of participating ULGs with completed subprojects to meet the
performance threshold for that indicator. So far:

                                              27
       Revenues — 40 percent of participating ULGs have increased or have vendor
        leases already in place that will increase their revenue from the facility by at least
        10% due to the investment. Of those that have met the target already, such as in
        Sidenreng Rappang the revenues have increased by between 5 to 6 times higher
        than those of the old markets.
       Operations and maintenance — 70 percent of participating ULGs have already
        increased their expenditures or have committed to increase in their budgets of at
        least 10 percent for O&M. The actual increase of the O&M in Palangkaraya is
        1.5 times. The O&M in Sidenreng Rappang has increased two times on average
        in the last three years of operations, but this is still seen as insufficient given that
        the markets are now overcapacity.
       User (vendor) satisfaction — In 60 percent of participating ULGs at least half of
        the vendors in the new facilities express increased satisfaction in doing business.
        This counts only the completed subprojects in which vendors have been moved
        back into the site and are conducting business. Vendors who plan to occupy the
        markets but have not yet begun conducting business were also surveyed and
        expressed satisfaction rates very similar to those for sites that are already used or
        operational. If these vendors were included, 100 percent of ULGs and 100
        percent of facilities would meet the satisfaction target. In most cases, satisfaction
        substantially exceeded the target (refer to Annex 5), which ranges from 65% to
        100%.
       Consumer satisfaction — In 60% of participating ULGs at least half of the
        consumers express increased satisfaction in using the new facilities. This counts
        only the completed subprojects in which facilities are operational and already in
        use by consumers. Customers who plan to shop at the markets that have not yet
        been opened for business were also surveyed and expressed satisfaction rates
        very similar to those for sites that are already used or operational. If these results
        were included, 100 percent of ULGs and 100 percent of facilities would meet the
        satisfaction target. As with the vendors, substantially more than half the
        consumers surveyed (ranges from 53%-100%) in the sample were satisfied with
        the new facilities (refer to Annex 5).

However, these figures do not fully reflect the projected outcomes from the completed
works, because measurement of results does not yet capture all the benefits of completed
subprojects that were not yet in operation (occupied by vendors) at the time the project
closed. Based on these preliminary results, the targets for increased revenues, O&M
expenditures, and vendor and consumer satisfaction are expected to be achieved in all or
nearly all the of the 10 participating ULGs (which would exceed the 70 percent target,
and equal the original quantitative target prior to the formal revision of indicators).

Linkages between Outputs and Outcomes

For both the governance and services objectives, there is an obvious linkage between the
project outputs and achievement of outcomes.

                                              28
In the case of the governance objectives, the mechanisms, financial and procurement
practices/reporting, disclosure requirements and procedures, and development plans and
strategies supported by the project are directly related to the outcomes (indeed, for this
objective the outputs are themselves part of the outcome). Further indirect evidence of the
governance and capacity objective is the performance of the ULGs in implementing and
completing the infrastructure investments in a transparent, consultative, and accountable
way, with good quality and in compliance with environmental and social safeguards
requirements.

For the selected urban services objective, the outputs (markets and terminals rehabilitated
or reconstructed), are a prerequisite to achievement of the objective in terms of benefits
provided by the facilities to both vendors and customers, as well as revenues to be
collected by the ULGs. The O&M expenditures or budgets are both a measure of the
sustainability of the investments, as well as a reflection of the ULGs capacity to manage
the facilities and provide improved services on an ongoing basis.

The project does not definitively establish or demonstrate a causal link between the
outputs/outcomes of Component A and Component B. However, as discussed in previous
sections, this is both an underlying assumption of, and longer-term, higher-level impact
related to the project objectives, but was not intended to be attributable to or monitorable
within the limited scope of the investment project itself.


Outputs

In the ULGs that participated until the end of the Project, local governance has indeed
been strengthened (Component A), and provision of selected urban services has indeed
been improved (Component B). Details on outputs are shown in Annex 2.

      Nearly all the numerous indicators and sub-indicators pertaining to Component A
       have been met or exceeded. The sole indicator that was only partially achieved is
       the indicator pertaining to performance assessment of contractors, and the limiting
       factor here is the absence of a sound legal basis for such an assessment.
      All investment subprojects under Component B have been completed, but in some
       ULGs there are delays in their utilization towards sustainable operation.

Causal Relationships with Bank Intervention/Inputs

There are clear causal relationships between Bank intervention/inputs and output
achievement, and between output achievement and outcome achievement. Hence there is
also a causal relationship throughout the entire results chain from Bank
intervention/inputs through achievement of project objectives/outcomes.

3.3       Efficiency

The Project’s overall efficiency assessment covers three aspects: (i) the efficiency in
initiating local governance reforms, (ii) the average cost effectiveness of investment
subprojects, and in addition (iii) the management efficiency of the implementation of
both components (see also Section 2.1).
      Component A. The efficiency in the implementation of Component A cannot
         sensibly be rated to the standards of an investment loan. The Project pioneered
         governance reforms for which there had been no precedent. This cannot be
         tangibly reflected in economic or financial figures, or in cost comparisons. The
         efficiency of the participating ULGs’ efforts in implementing governance reforms
         was enhanced by templates the project preparation team had drafted for the
         various decrees and regulations that the heads of ULGs or local parliaments were
         expected to pass as part of Project implementation. The efficiency was further
         enhanced by synergies between the USDRP and another local governance reform
         project, the ILGR, in the form of exchange of experiences and reconciliation of
         the reform efforts. On the other hand, serious delays in procuring consultants
         reduced the efficiency.

         Component B. Efficiency in the implementation of Component B is considered
          moderately satisfactory, on the basis of the available data. As a precondition for
          the acceptance into the Project, all subprojects had to be directly revenue-
          generating with anticipated FRR estimated. Sufficient field data to recalculate the
          FRR at project completion is unfortunately not available in a quality that is
          comparable between ULGs. In some ULGs, net revenue obtained (i. e. gross
          revenue minus incremental expenditure for O&M) will probably suffice to cover
          the repayment of the SLA. In other ULGs there are signs that this may not be the
          case. This would imply that the expected FRR (as stated in the PAD) has not been
          achieved. This may be outside the control of Project management (e. g. PMU and
          even CPMU) because a major factor in the cost recovery are the user charges (e.
          g. shop rents) and these are often fixed by local parliaments on the grounds of
          political considerations. In any case, all projects were tendered competitively,
          with many safeguards against mismanagement deployed, and the costs were
          consistent with the cost norms of the construction industry in Indonesia.

         Implementation Management. The efficiency of implementation management is
          not rated. Efficiency was certainly curtailed by the very low capacities of
          participating ULGs in combination with their extremely wide geographical
          spread. The low capacities required intensive support and tight supervision; at the
          same time, such support (e. g. through deployment of consultants or meetings of
          ULGs) and supervision (through regular and ad-hoc missions) was very time and
          resource consuming. However, the geographical spread was part of the Project
          design and beyond the control of the implementation managers. A regional
          clustering of subproject locations would have enhanced the implementation
          efficiency considerably but this would have been against the spirit of a demand-
          driven project open to all interested ULGs.

3.4       Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The overall outcome is rated as moderately satisfactory on the basis of the assessments
presented above including their justifications:

         Project was highly relevant for Indonesia’s political agenda as well as the
          CAS/CPS.
         Achievement of the governance objective was very strong, with almost all ULGs
          meeting or exceeding the detailed targets for a range of improvement in different
          aspects of governance and capacity as a result of the reforms they adopted.
         Achievement of the selected urban services objective was also good, though not
          as clear-cut as the governance objectives. Although all of the
          infrastructure/facilities were completed with good quality, transparent and
          consultative procedures, and sound procurement and financial management, only
          five of the facilities has been fully reoccupied by the returning vendors (except
          Palopo), five were partially occupied, and five were still unoccupied. However
          since the resettlement arrangements for temporarily relocated vendors were fully
          compliant with safeguard policies, and no problems or significant delays are
          expected in completing the relocation into the new facilities, the very positive
          preliminary results from the fully operational markets are expected in the
          remaining ones as well.
         The efficiency of project implementation and achievement of outcomes, to the
          extent that the various aspects were amenable to such analysis, was moderately
          satisfactory.

The objectives were not explicitly weighted in the PAD, and their relationship and
importance is subject differing interpretations as reflected in some sections of the ICR
(especially Sections 1.2 and 1.3). For purposes of the ICR they are given equal weight.
Outcomes for both objectives are considered to be in the Satisfactory to Moderately
Satisfactory range, though the case for governance being Satisfactory is stronger than for
selected services. Given the incomplete data for performance of the completed markets
that have not been occupied by vendors yet, selected urban services is only considered
Moderately Satisfactory despite confidence that the targets will be met once the facilities
are fully occupied and operational. Therefore, the overall rating is based on the lower of
the two objectives.

Outcome Rating against Original and Revised PDO

The outcome is rated Moderately Satisfactory against both the original and revised PDO,
with the comments/observations listed below.

         As discussed in earlier sections, the formal revision of the PDO in effect was a
          correction to a poorly articulated PDO (rather than a change in the project’s actual

                                              31
          objectives) so that it would better capture the objectives logically implied by the
          project design, activities, and indicators. This view is validated by the QEA7
          report completed shortly after approval, which noted the shortcomings in the
          formal PDO statement, and unambiguously identified two primary objectives
          corresponding closely to those eventually formalized via the Board-approved
          revision of the PDO in June 2010. In short, while technically the original and
          revised PDOs were different, the actual intended and recognized objectives were
          fundamentally the same.
         Even absent this argument, the original PDO conceptually incorporated elements
          of capacity in its formulation by specifying provision of services by ULGs rather
          than the service themselves. Furthermore, the provision of selected services was
          determined to be MS in the final project, which logically means that the services-
          only formulation in the original PDO would also be MS even if interpreted
          literally.
         The Project’s relevance is equally high for either PDO.
         Although the number or ULGs in the original indicator targets was replaced by a
          percentage to reflect the changing number of participating ULGs, ultimately the
          targets for governance were met in all ten of the participating ULGs, and while
          targets for urban services are substantially short of ten ULGs, they are fairly close
          to the new target of 70 percent, and are expected to be close to 100 percent once
          the completed markets are fully occupied and operational.
         The Project implementation efficiency rating would be the same for either PDO.

Combined IBRD and PHRD disbursements at the time of the revision were about $18.1
million, which equals 36 percent of appraised costs and 44 percent of the final disbursed
amount. However, since the rating is MS against both the original and revised objectives,
the overall rating is also MS regardless of the percent disbursed at the time of revision.

3.5       Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts:

(a)       Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The Project was not to address primarily issues of poverty, gender equality, or social
development, and it has not significantly altered pre-existing conditions in these fields.
There were no negative side effects in any of these fields, and pro-active efforts were
made to incorporate poverty, gender, and other social development aspects to the extent
feasible.

Poverty Orientation. As mentioned in Section 3.1, Project investments were carefully
designed and implemented so as to provide opportunities for small-scale/poor traders
(many of whom are women) in markets and to provide service and business opportunity
to the fishermen (many of whom are poor) in Morowali. In market subprojects, a fixed
quota of the total trading space was set aside for small-scale/poor traders who operate on



                                               32
very small plots of floor space rather than in kiosks or shops. This low-cost variety of
trading also benefits low-income shoppers.

Gender Aspects. Data collection on existing traders in markets was disaggregated by
gender to help ensure women would not be disadvantaged during the reallocation of
trading space in the new markets. The participation of women in capacity building events
was typically 9-25%.

Other Social Development Aspects. A number of subprojects were carefully designed
to provide access to mobility impaired people, e. g. by providing access ramps
(see Additional Annex 16).

(b)    Institutional Change/Strengthening:

Improved Procedures and Practices. Institutional changes including the establishment
of improved procedures and the introduction of improved practices were the very focus
of Component A. This was very successfully implemented, as is documented in the
achievement of the relevant KPIs.

Urban Institutional Development Program. The original concept of an Urban
Institutional Development Program (UIDP) as a national-level entity/facility was
modified during the Project restructuring. The revised output achieved is the
establishment of a provincial-level PIP2B in South Sulawesi Province as a Center of
Excellence for Urban Management, complete with a viable work plan, as described in
Section 2.5.

Local Economic Development / City Development Strategies. Under Component A,
the Project supported the ULGs in preparing integrated Local Economic Development/
City Development Strategies. Guidelines to this effect were compiled by Project
consultants. The finalization of these works by ULGs and the allocation of budget to start
their implementation is a success in institutional strengthening with a potential long-term
benefit. Pare-pare city passed its Local Economic Development / City Development
Strategy in the form of a Regional Regulation (“Peraturan Daerah – Perda”).

Urban Development Coordination Team. An Urban Development Coordination Team
(“Tim Koordinasi Pembangunan Perkotaan” – TKPP) was formed at the national level in
1987 in connection with the IUIDP projects (see Section 1.1). With the phasing-out of the
IUIDP projects, that team became defunct. Under the USDRP, the idea was revived and
the coordinating team re-established in 2010, as “Tim Koordinasi Pembangunan
Perkotaan Nasional (TKPPN)”, led by Bappenas.

(c)    Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative):

Withdrawal and Addition of ULGs. An unintended negative development was the
withdrawal of eight ULGs during the first few years of Project implementation. This had
a negative impact on the Project as it diverted resources that had been meant for
implementation management, and it had a negative impact on the ULGs themselves
                                             33
because the resources they had expended on preparing their participation in the Project
had thus been wasted, and they missed out on the benefits that the continued participation
in the Project would have given them.

Leveraging of Additional Investments. A positive outcome that had not necessarily
been expected at appraisal was the successful leveraging of additional investments, as
mentioned in Section 3.1.

3.6    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops:

Beneficiary Surveys. The Project included a Project Benefit Monitoring & Evaluation
(PBME) exercise, and a comprehensive PBME report was completed in May 2013, based
on enquiries made and surveys conducted in each participating ULG and at the location
of each subproject. The PBME report concludes that Component A has been
implemented quite successfully and that the aimed-at satisfaction levels of users of assets
created under Component B had been achieved or would be achieved once these assets
had been put into operation and could be utilized. The findings of the PBME surveys,
interpreted very conservatively, were used to document the achievement of the PDO
indicators. See also Annex 5.

Local Stakeholder Workshops. Besides numerous stakeholder workshops during
Project implementation, each participating ULGs conducted an exit strategy workshop,
with representatives of the EA and the Bank in attendance (refer to Annex 6). ULGs
signed MoUs with the EA and committed themselves to:
     continuing to work towards the achievement of any as-yet-unattained target even
       beyond the loan closing date,
     improve further the governance reform results achieved so far, and
     sustain/maintain the successes achieved in either Project component.

National Stakeholder Workshop. In addition, a final national-level project stakeholder
workshop was implemented in May 2013, co-chaired by the Director of Program
Development in the EA and the Director of Urban and Rural Affairs in Bappenas. In this
workshop, the EA committed itself to providing the incentives projects mentioned above
(see Section 2.5), and Bappenas confirmed its commitment to articulating a national
urban development policy document.

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

Risks to the Development Outcome. Most kinds of potential risk to the development
outcome can be considered low to moderate, and it can be expected that they will even
decrease further over time.

Investment Subprojects. Where investment subprojects were markets, their social and
political acceptance as well as their technical and economic feasibility are not in doubt.
All investment subprojects have been technically completed to the point that there is no
                                            34
significant hindrance to their operation. Some participating ULGs have yet to make
arrangements that will fully guarantee the long-term optimum management and the
sustained financial viability (from the ULG’s perspective) of the newly created assets.
Even so, it can reasonably be expected that pressure from civil society / intended
beneficiaries would not allow ULGs to leave these assets idle for too long, as their
potential benefit for the public is so high and so obvious. The need to raise funds for the
repayment of the SLA will increase the pressure on ULGs even further. On the other
hand, there is indeed a risk that ULGs may not provide sufficient budget for adequate
O&M on a sustained long-term basis and/or that the management of the facility may be
less than optimum. This is an endemic problem in Indonesia, and this risk to the
sustainability of the subprojects cannot be denied.

Governance Reform. In this field, the Project outcome is mainly the introduction of
improved practices by/in participating ULGs. The overall political climate of Indonesia
will most probably remain favorable for sustaining these reforms and developing them
even further.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry:

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory.

Correct Assessment of Context. The Bank team identified and assessed some of the
trends and challenges as well as opportunities and threats for the project fairly correctly
during preparation stage.

Acceptable Handling of Most Other Aspects. Most of the aspects that need to be
covered for project appraisal were handled adequately (e. g. country context analysis and
conformation of government commitment). In hindsight, several of the FRRs derived
from the feasibility studies that applying ULGs had submitted appear to have been rather
optimistic estimates, but this was probably not obvious at the time of appraisal.

Project Design Flaws. However, there were some significant design flaws that could
possibly have been avoided. The PAD mentions only briefly the possibility of the
withdrawal of some ULGs and/or the later participation in the Project by other ULGs,
apparently without realizing how resource consuming the handling of these processes
would be. Because of this misjudgment, rather insufficient resources were allocated to the
handling of these processes by both the government and the Bank team.

The QALP-2 report already mentioned the undue complexity of the Project (i. e. its
reliance on on-lending for the implementation of the investment subprojects) as a design
flaw. However, GoI had insisted on this modality which was beyond the Bank team’s
influence. The risk management during preparation phase can be regarded as inadequate,
especially with regard to (1) correctly assessing the capacity limitations at all levels of
                                            35
government and designing sufficient mitigation measures to address these, and
(2) anticipating further changes in the legal framework for fiscal decentralization.

Besides the design flaws mentioned in the QALP-2 report, and with the benefit of
hindsight, numerous other risks and potential pitfalls can now be identified (see Section
2.1). The stakeholders designing the Project may not have been at fault but they
objectively misjudged the Project environment in several aspects and objectively
underrated a number of significant risks which is why the project design contains
insufficient risk mitigation efforts. Several risks became evident only during
implementation and had to be addressed in an ad-hoc manner which put a serious strain
on Project management.

(b) Quality of Supervision(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies):

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Challenges. During implementation, the Bank team had to deal with several major
challenges the seriousness of which far exceeded the challenges of routine supervision:
    There was a high degree of uncertainty and fluctuation in the interest and ability
       of ULGs to participate in the Project. The factors that led to the withdrawal of
       eight ULGs (see Additional Annex 11) were beyond the control of the Bank team.
       Vice versa, five ULGs joined the Project during implementation stage, and the
       processes of admitting them (verifying that they met the entry criteria and
       assisting them in preparing their subprojects) were very resource consuming.
    The changing of general rules for on-lending to sub-national governments by
       MoF and the slow processing of SLAs were beyond the control of the Bank team.

Pursuing a reform agenda in implementing agencies inevitably implies a discontinuation
of established and familiar practices which tends to generate a feeling of disorientation.
This cannot be held against the Bank team per se, but the likelihood of this happening
and the resulting consequences should have been considered better during preparation,
and a more realistic implementation and disbursement projection should have been made.
This aspect touches upon the quality at entry.

Performance. Full-blown, comprehensive supervision missions were conducted twice a
year. Besides these, smaller thematic missions were conducted as needed. Supervision
increasingly focused on development impact and achievement of the PDO, besides
assessing the implementation progress. In assessing the latter, supervision missions did
not limit their work to simply registering the production of sub-outputs (e. g. a Mayor’s
Decision required) but ventured into checking carefully the completeness, adequacy, and
quality of such sub-outputs. Monitoring of participating ULGs’ adherence to fiduciary
and safeguards policies and related guiding /corrective action were fully adequate. In
those few cases where corrective action was required it was initiated without undue
delay. The Bank team made very intensive efforts to facilitate the transition to post-
completion operation and utilization/application of the outputs and/or sub-outputs
achieved under either component in every local government. Candor and quality of

                                           36
performance reporting were of high standard which is evident from the comprehensive
and very detailed aide memoires and Implementation Status Reports prepared after each
mission.

Despite intensive supervisions, the Bank team and the other stakeholders overlooked the
need to formulate suitable PDO-level indicators reflecting the outcome of the governance
reforms. However, the primary fault was not in actually formulating the indicators, but
failing to designate some of them as PDO-level rather than intermediate indicators. As
reflected in other sections, and in accordance with the guidance of OPCS and IEG in the
OPCS Guidelines and other ICR preparation clinics and training materials, rather than
mechanically following the letter of the Results Framework, the ICR in fact uses these as
indicators to assess achievement of the governance objective in the PDO, as was likely
intended in the Restructuring Paper and project design. Other shortcomings in
supervision were only minor. Inputs were comparatively high because the participating
ULGs were very scattered which was an inevitable implication of the Project design.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. This aggregate rating of 5.1(a) and 5.1(b) takes into
consideration that the outcome rating is in the satisfactory range.

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance:

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Justification of Rating. The overall rating takes into account that government
performance showed significant shortcomings during the preparation stage and early
implementation stage but improved markedly during implementation and showed only
minor shortcomings after that. Hereby, government institutions involved in the project
were not only the EA but also other national-level entities including the IMSC and the
MoF. Government ownership was strong throughout, evidenced by several instances of
emphatic corrective action in response to problems, and stakeholder consultations before
appraisal were adequate.

Executing Agency. The EA performed well during the preparation stage but was not
sufficiently ready when Project implementation began. This is evidenced e. g. by the
insufficient staffing of the CPMU which resulted in serious delays to the recruitment of
consultants. The QALP-2 report mentioned this deficiency already. Over time, however,
the EA provided the CPMU with more/better staff resources who were deployed full-
time, and the CPMU’s performance improved markedly. It goes to the EA’s credit that it
worked with high dedication on issues that are, strictly speaking, not its mandate
(governance reforms and local economic development) and achieved a remarkable degree
of success. In addition, the EA communicated intensively with parliament to expedite the
release of SLA funds (see Section 2.2), supported ULGs intensively in their procurement
(e. g. by deploying staff to a local tender committee), promoted the modality of advance
                                           37
procurement, and provided substantial budget for capacity building. Also, the EA
published “USDRP – Promoting Urban Self-Reliance: Reflection of the USDRP
Implementation” (see Additional Annex 15 for more details). Although the EA’s
performance towards the end of Project implementation could be rated as satisfactory,
overall during Project implementation its performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

Other National-Level Entities. Project preparation was hampered when GoI changed
the rules for the funding of prospective subprojects (see Additional Annex for more
details 14). This undermined the interest and commitment of ULGs to participate in the
Project (see also QALP-2 report). The processing of the required SLAs took an
unexpectedly long time, not the least because ULGs found it difficult to meet the required
quality standards of documentation. Both shortcomings put additional stress on the EA’s
resources during preparation and implementation. The IMSC provided very useful
oversight and guidance to the Project although one might argue that a smaller size would
have made it more agile and able to reach necessary decisions more quickly.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance:

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Background. The ULGs as implementing agencies showed mixed performance. Of the
thirteen ULGs considered participating at appraisal, eight withdrew during Project
implementation before commencing their physical subprojects and disbursing any loan
funds for these. More details are given in Additional Annex 11. The performance of those
ULGs can thus not be assessed. In most of these cases, newly elected political leaders
discontinued the commitment shown by earlier ULG leaders but this cannot necessarily
be classified as poor performance because this discontinuation was sometimes a reaction
to developments beyond the control of the ULGs (e. g. shifts in the political stance of
local parliament following local elections). On the other hand, five additional ULGs
joined the Project after loan effectiveness, i. e. during implementation stage. None of
these dropped back out again.

Justification for Rating. General commitment was high among the ULGs that
participated in the Project until completion. However, they were not sufficiently ready for
implementation by loan effectiveness. This was mainly a problem of low awareness of
the requirements and low capacity of available staff. In mitigation, participating ULGs
made very substantial efforts to gain the necessary knowledge and overcome the capacity
bottleneck with help from the EA and the Bank team. Participatory processes (especially
with regard to moving traders) and fiduciary requirements were handled well, and there
was substantial willingness to address arising issues in a timely manner which is
documented in the sequence of aide memoires from the supervision missions.

Component A. All ULGs have achieved – in most cases even over-achieved – the
agreed-upon target indicators for reforms of local governance (Component A).

Component B. All 15 investment subprojects (Component B) have been physically
completed as planned, and more than half have been put into operation, although often
                                            38
not with the desirable speed and effectiveness. Some participating ULGs have yet to
make fully sufficient institutional arrangements for their potentially sustainable operation
and management but these efforts are continuing and demonstrate an unbroken
commitment to the Project.

Capacity Deficiencies. The objective performance of Project management staff of
participating ULGs particularly the PMU, PIU and the Tender Committees, was often
affected by a lack of experience in handling World Bank rules for procurement and
safeguards management. These deficiencies appear to have been underrated, and
mitigating measures appear to have been under-designed during Project preparation. The
efforts of the CPMU during project implementation to directly assist the ULGs and
provide series of procurement training were instrumental to overcome the deficiencies.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance:

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

This is the aggregate rating of 5.2(a) and 5.2(b) above, based on the aspects and
arguments listed there.

6.      Lessons Learned (both project-specific and of wide general application)

The most prominent lessons learned are:

     1. Project implementation was successful owing to the high commitment of the EA,
        especially the CPMU, ULGs, and the key role of the IMSC. On the other hand,
        the involvement of sectoral ministries could have been stronger.

     2. The creation of a platform for local governance reforms works best through a
        combination of (a) legally binding regulations, (b) adequate institutional
        arrangements, (c) actual practices, and (d) strengthening the capacity of
        “champions”, supported by (e) a system of incentives and disincentives.

     3. Lessons learned and experiences of local governments should have been
        considered as inputs to the relevant national legislations, so that the reform agenda
        is tailored to local situation and realistic.

     4. Peer-to-peer learning and on-the-job training are two capacity building schemes
        that can be more effective than traditional, formal training. Training with outputs
        that are to be implemented by the ULGs under the Project was quite effective to
        achieve the KPIs.

     5. Implementation of subprojects will be more successful if aspects of eventual long-
        term operation (especially management set-up and funding) are considered from
        the preparation.



                                             39
      6. Capacity building activities should be given more attention; this includes the
         participation of agency leaders (Kepala Dinas) and local parliament members.

      7. Funding of local subprojects through SLAs tends be convoluted and protracted;
         future projects should consider alternative funding mechanisms, i.e. among others,
         a financial intermediary facility when numerous local governments are involved.

      8. When determining the readiness for implementation during the appraisal process,
         one key aspect to expedite the start-up of project implementation is to promote the
         advance procurement prior to loan effectiveness.

      9. The trade-off of benefits between a project being open to all ULGs and regional
         clustering should be considered very carefully at appraisal, bearing in mind the
         inefficiencies that could result from regional scattering of project locations.

      10. In a situation of great political flux and administrative restructuring, and in the
          midst of an emphatic reform drive aimed at democratization and decentralization,
          prudent project design will anticipate a slower-than-usual implementation and
          disbursement. Project design should also (a) design a mechanism and (b) assign
          resources for dealing with unforeseen developments, e. g. (1) changes in
          commitment of ULGs or (2) requests from further ULGs to join the project.

during Project implementation, are quoted in Additional Annex 15.

Note: Annex 5 of the PAD included allowances for physical and price contingencies (and taxes and duties).
However, all other costing of components in the PAD rolled these contingencies into the component costs,
except for $2 million in unallocated funds. Therefore they are not included here so that there is greater
consistency with the baseline costs in the component descriptions in the PAD, and to give a clearer picture of
appraised and actual costs for the components.

Annex 2.           Outputs by Component

Component A — Urban Reform and Institutional Development:

Attainment of Outputs Reflected in Indicators

As mentioned in Section 3.2, the outputs/outcomes related to the governance reform
objectives were quite strong, in most cases exceeding both overall goals and individual
subparts of the main indicators. Originally the targets were to be achieved in 10 ULGs.
This was later revised to a percentage of participating ULGs with completed subprojects.
Except for systematic evaluation of contractor performance and public recognition of the
best performers, the overall targets were achieved for all main targets, and in a number of
cases 100% (10 ULGs) met the requirement.

The first table below summarizes the results for each participating ULG in the three main
dimensions of governance reform. The second table shows the aggregate results for all
ULGs broken out by each of the detailed goals or requirements within each indicator.

Many of the ULG outputs/outcomes listed (and rated in general terms) below can be
verified in the ULGs’ website, where much of the underlying information is published.
The URL addresses for the websites of all participating ULGs are list in Annex 13.

The ULGs rated Satisfactory (++) significantly exceeded the individual targets in the
respective indicators. Those rated Moderately Satisfactory (+) came close to the targets,
in some cases exceeding them and in others falling slightly short. The ULGs rated
Moderately Unsatisfactory (-) achieved meaningful improvements, but were still
significantly short of the individual targets.

At the provincial and national level, the Project’s outputs included (only the Center of
Excellence was included in the formal Results Framework):

      a provincial-level “Center of Excellence” for Urban Management has been
       established and operationalized in South Sulawesi,
      the National Urban Development Coordination Team, previously defunct, has
       been re-launched,
      the preparation of a national urban development policy document has been
       initiated.

Other Outputs

In addition to the formally approved output / outcome indicators, the project monitored a
number of other aspects of ULG performance that further support the conclusion that the
implementation of governance reforms was successful. Other Project outputs attained
under Component A include the following:

      intensive and successful capacity building efforts have enabled relevant ULG staff
       to deal with
           o the requirements for achieving the core governance reforms under the
               Project,
           o improved construction design (including earthquake resistance),
               construction planning and construction management,
           o procurement procedures under World Bank rules and procurement reforms
               which were implemented and achieved prior to the requirements of the
               national regulation on procurement,
           o sound financial management in general and compliance with World Bank
               requirements for reforms and in line with the existing government
               regulation,
           o social safeguards requirements for World Bank funded projects (mainly
               pertaining to temporary and permanent resettlement),
           o environmental safeguards requirements for World Bank funded projects
               (mainly pertaining to environmental mitigation and monitoring for small
               projects),
           o improved sustainable management of assets, especially markets,
           o preparation of Local Economic Development /City Development
               Strategies.

Further achievements in local governance reforms that can be associated with the Project
include the following:

      all participating ULGs have established Procurement Anchor Units,
      all participating ULGs have centralized procurement in one dedicated unit,
      all participating ULGs have adopted standard bidding documents,
      all participating ULGs have improved procurement related information and
       services,

                                           44
      all participating ULGs have issued a local regulation on improved transparency,
      most participating ULGs have issued a local regulation on sound financial
       management procedures and practices,
      most participating ULGs have issued a local regulation on public participation in
       decision-making,
      most participating ULGs have strengthened the roles of their respective urban
       forums or other platforms for participatory planning.


Component B — Urban Investments:

The table below lists the 15 investment subprojects completed by the 10 participating
ULGs. At approval, 13 ULGs were included in the project, but due to the changes in local
governments, challenges to finalizing subsidiary loan agreements and other factors, 8 of
the original ULGs eventually withdrew, and 3 new ULGs entered the project. As with the
governance indictors, originally the investment targets were based on 10 participating
ULGs achieving the targets (75% of the participating ULGs), but due to the changing
number of participants, the quantitative targets were changed to percentages, though in
the end many some of the indicators met both the percentage target and the original
numerical target.

Some markets of the completed markets are in high demand, resulting in oversubscribed
or overused. This situation is obvious for the three markets in Sidenreng Rappang which
was already overcrowded. It was reported that number of traders has continued to
increase since the markets were opened. Local Government has to expand the market by
its own budget, and the Ministry of Trade also built a new market next to USDRP’s
market. In addition, the market in Pare-pare also generated high-demand as the number of
traders that subscribed for kiosks/lots have been higher than planned. Information on the
capacity of each market or number of traders in each market is presented in the Table
below. For the markets that have been used (in operation) such as in Sidenreng Rappang,
Palangkaraya, and Palopo, the numbers are actual, while for the yet to be used markets,
the number indicates the plans. It is clear that markets in Sidenreng Rappang were
overcrowded indicating high demand, and if number of traders continues to increase, this
could reduce the service quality of the facilities. In the case of Parepare, the new market’s
capacity is higher than the plan, showing that there was expansion during construction to
accommodate the growing number of traders.

The facilities that are listed as partially used, or not yet used in the table below, reflect
completed markets where the final stage of moving the vendors back into the markets has
not been completed (however, all agreements and terms related to the final relocation are
finalized and the delay does not reflect shortcomings in safeguard compliance or
performance). Almost all the markets are fully equipped and functional, but in a few
cases utilities not financed or implemented under the project are still being connected. In
some of them, vendors have begun moving their goods into the kiosks while utility
connections are still pending.


                                             45
In addition, in some cases local governments are still finalizing details of the tariff (rent)
structure for the new facilities, or election of a new mayor or municipal government has
delayed the final administrative steps in the process of occupying the buildings.

One case study (Market Reconstruction in Sawahlunto) is described in more detail in
Additional Annex 16.

The subproject in Banda Aceh is part of a bigger, integrated market development project
that became necessary because the old market had been completely destroyed by the
tsunami of December 2004. The first phase was constructed with assistance from the
Government of Japan, the second phase was constructed by USDRP, and the third phase
is being implemented with funds from GoI. All three phases are physically integrated,
and the new market as a whole will be managed by a dedicated, semi-independent entity,
namely a Local Government Public Service Board (Badan Layanan Umum Daerah -

                                                          46
BLUD). This is the first time in Indonesia that a BLUD has been tasked with managing a
market.

Specifically in Palopo, the management of the new market including O&M has been
outsourced for 25 years to a private sector entity after a transparent and competitive
procurement procedure. With this, the risk has been transferred away from the ULG, and
the ULG will have a more predictable cash flow as the basis for repaying its SLA.

Original and Revised Indicators

The project indicators were formally revised through a Board-approved restructuring in
June 2010. This mainly involved dropping original indicators and replacing them with
ones that the Bank and Borrower agreed were more monitorable and would better focus
the project activities and better reflect its outcomes. In most cases, targets without clearly
defined or measurable goals, or which were based on secondary plans and feasibility
studies unique to each ULGs or subprojects, were replaced with more universal but still
specific and quantifiable ones. Since the indicators themselves were changed rather than
the targets, reflecting the revisions in the Data Sheet is not practical. Therefore the
comparative matrix from the project Restructuring Paper is reproduced below in order to
give a full accounting of the indicator and demonstrate the relationship of the revised
indicators to the original ones.

Annex 3.         Economic and Financial Analysis

      The Project has 15 subprojects, 13 of which are markets. This ICR present an
example of Economic and Financial Analysis for a rebuilt market in Sawahlunto.

A.        Project Objectives

   As part of the Urban Sector Development Reform (USDRP), the objective of this project is to
revitalize Sawahlunto traditional market. Further, it is also aimed at increasing the
competitiveness of traders in the traditional markets as well as creating more jobs for those living
in Sawahlunto area. This is expected that the project to have a positive impact beyond the
construction of the market, since the market is located in the middle of the city it will generate
more economic activity.

   The integrated financial and economic analysis of the project starts with a description of
project cost and revenue forecasting over 20 years period and then conducts cost-benefit analysis.
The financial analysis assesses the financial sustainability of the proposed project under different
cost and revenue assumptions.

B.        Project Costs

          Total investment loan agreed and disbursed for this project is 17.5 billion Rupiah or equal
to US$152 million1 or equal to 94.09% from the whole investment intended for construction. The
loan will be used for constructing new stores, kiosks, stalls, cafeteria and other supporting
facilities.

        In order to analyze the full costs of the project, annual operating and maintenance (O&M)
costs for the Sawahlunto traditional market investments under this Project were included in the
analysis. Operational and maintenance costs for the market include waste management, cleaning
service, building maintenance, personnel costs, and the cost for electricity and water. Project
investments would have a service life of at least 15 years. Table XX below summarize the
estimated project costs.

C.           Overview of Financial Revenue Projection

    The benefit or revenue of the project was based fairly on conservative assumptions with
respect to tariffs and occupancy rate. The analysis does not include benefits that are complex to
quantify such as economic spill-over to formal and informal sectors and multiplier effect to the
surrounding economy. Revenue streams from this project are assumed coming from several
elements such as:
     Store rental: the rent varies from 5.5 million rupiah/year (3x3 Meters) to 7.5 million
        rupiah/year (3x4 Meters). The market management predicts that 213 old vendors will
        occupy the 308 new stores. 50 traders outside the market will be relocated inside the
        market and it is estimated that the market could attract as many as 45 new traders.
     Cafeteria: The area is around 160 m2 and estimated to be able to accommodate
        approximately 16 food vendors with an annual rent/unit of 8 million rupiah.
     Parking: Parking inside the market provides spaces to around 25 trucks, 40 cars, and 150
        motorcycles per day. Tariff imposed by the operator varied from 1000 rupiah to 5000
        rupiah depends on size of the cars.
     Stalls location: Stalls and street vendors will have to pay for an extra rent amounting to 2
        million Rupiah per year; although, local government will be responsible for this costs.
     Waste & Sanitation plus MCK (Restroom) levy
     Billboard advertising: Advertising tariff is flat at 45000 Rupiah/meter/year. It is estimated
        that revenue generating from advertising will reach 15 million Rupiah/year.
     Terminal: Tariff varies depending on the service provided by the operators.

D.        Cost-Benefit Analysis

        The Net present value (NPV) is a monetary estimate, in today’s term, of the generation of
net benefits over the life of a project. Typically projects with positive NPV are seen as favorable.
The NPV of this Project investments were then calculated or the Project as a whole, over a period
of 20 years (2011-2029). The discount rate used was 11.45 percent based on the sum of interest
rate and commitment fee. For illustrative purposes, the internal rate of return (based on net
financial benefits) was also calculated, to show the discount rate at which net present value would
be zero. The results of the cost-benefit analysis are summarized in Table XX below. The Project
NPV over above mentioned period of time, at a discount rate of 11.45 percent, is estimated at
8,060 Million Rupiah, with an internal rate of return (IRR) of 18 percent.

E. Sensitivity Analysis

         The sensitivity of the project’s net financial benefits was analyzed with respect to two
financial variables and divided into three different scenarios. The first analysis is if there is an
increase in operational and maintenance costs by 10 percent. Second and third scenarios are if
there is a decline in revenue stream of 10 and 20 percent, respectively. The results of this
sensitivity analysis are presented in Table XX below in terms of three cases.

         The results of the sensitivity analysis reveal that the overall net benefits of the project are
relatively insensitive to an increase of cost as well as considerable decreases in income. The main
conclusion to be drawn from this analysis, therefore, is that the project is financially feasible
given the three scenarios. The internal rates of returns for the three cases are between 13.89 to
17.51 percent.

Annex 5.      Beneficiary Survey Results

The Project included a Project Benefit Monitoring & Evaluation (PBME) exercise, and a
comprehensive PBME report was completed in May 2013. Beneficiaries’ surveys were
carried out for traders and consumers for markets, as well as drivers and passengers for a
terminal, both are facilities under Component B (urban investment). Its findings are
summarized below.

To assess the benefit (or, more accurately, the user satisfaction and perception of usefulness)
of the markets and the terminal constructed under the project, between 60 and over 200
persons were interviewed in each subproject location. In the case where assets had not yet
been used or put into operation, only a smaller number of respondents were interviewed (30
traders and 30 shoppers) but where facilities were already used (in operation) 103 traders and
103 shoppers per location were interviewed. At the Toboli Terminal in Parigi Moutong, 30
drivers and 30 passengers were interviewed. The responses were positive to very positive,
with very high degrees of user satisfaction. No interviews were conducted at the fish auction
market in Morowali because it was still under construction when the PBME field surveys
were implemented. In those locations where subprojects had not yet been put into operation,
interviewees were asked whether they would consider the assets useful and would feel more
satisfied (compared to the old subprojects) when the rebuilt subprojects were in operation.
Although it was rather a perception, the responses were generally positive but are still of
speculative nature.

Prima facie, the results of the PBME surveys, with the provisions mentioned above, showed
the aimed-at satisfaction level of more than 50% (as specified in the KPIs but in fact, in most
cases very much higher) in all subproject locations and for all groups of respondents. Even
so, the Project team has excluded from its assessments responses that pertained to facilities
that were not yet in use or in operation. Furthermore, the Project team also excluded the
survey results of the markets in Sawahlunto and Banda Aceh in the calculation in the Results
Framework, as they have been only in partial operation at the ICR, and therefore the survey
results of satisfaction done prior to the Project closing were only reflecting the perceptions of
the beneficiaries/users prior to the use of the markets. The same treatment applied for other
ULGs whose facilities were not in operation/used by Project closing.

At the time of Project closing presented in the Table below, six ULGs had 7 markets and one
terminal that were fully used or partially used. The survey suggested that in these eight
subprojects, 65% to 100% of users (traders/drivers) have increased their satisfaction by using
the new facilities, and 53% to 100% of consumers/passengers have increased their
satisfaction with the new facilities. On average, 82 % of traders/drivers and 82% of
consumers/passengers have increased their satisfaction in using the new facilities. Overall,
for all subprojects if they were all in use/operations, it is expected that the average increased
satisfaction is 80.5% and 82.2%, for users and consumers, respectively.

Notes:
(*) Beneficiaries’ anticipated satisfaction levels (or perception of satisfaction levels) when the subprojects were
in operation.
(**) At the time of ICR / Project closing, markets in Sawahlunto and Banda Aceh were partially in use.
Satisfaction survey was done at Project closing, therefore the beneficiaries satisfaction results for these two
markets are considered anticipated or perception of satisfaction levels (as the case of all other ULGs with (*))
and therefore are not counted in the Results Framework.
(***) Construction of all subprojects financed under the Project was completed at the Project closing of May 31,
2013.

Annex 6.     Stakeholder Workshop Reports and Results

Local Stakeholders Workshops. Besides numerous stakeholder workshops during Project
implementation, each participating ULG conducted an exit strategy workshop which was
carried out simultaneously with the project completion mission in April 2013, with PMU,
PIU and other stakeholders as well as representatives of the EA and the Bank in attendance.
The objectives of the Exit Strategy Workshop were to: (a) discuss and agree positive results
that needs to be implemented continuously; (b) discuss and share lessons learned from
failures or shortcomings experienced during project implementation; (c) agree to complete all
remaining activities to achieve the KPIs prior to project closing date; (d) discuss and agree
with ULGs on the continuation and/or expansion of the governance reform activities beyond
the project closing by their own.

The workshops revealed that
   (a) All ULGs were happy and useful with the activities supported by the project and the
       results as of to date despite some difficulties they had been facing during
       implementation. For instance, reform activities have strengthened the directions and
       milestone to be achieved as specified in the KPIs, have established a platform to carry
       out reform activities further, and have established same perception on governance
       reform amongst all stakeholders in the executive (and to a certain extent in the
       legislative). Some ULGs have experienced positive impacts of the reform in other
       sector. For instance, the implementation of procurement by an ULP (Procurement
       Unit—all procurement below certain threshold is centralized in this unit) in
       Sawahlunto with intensive and regular monitoring has improved the budget
       evaluation and planning due to better information of savings from the tenders. Other
       examples are: Banda Aceh has established a Public Service Unit (BLUD—Badan
       layanan Umum Daerah), the first of its kind in the country for market management;
       Cimahi will continue to improve the web/SMS-based complaint handling (Pesduk—
       Pesan Penduduk); and, Sidenreng Rappang is preparing a Local regulation for Public
       Information Disclosure.
   (b) All ULGs agreed to achieve the KPIs prior to project closing date and voluntarily
       agreed to continue implementing and improving reform quality (and expansion as
       needed), as well as improving management of the urban investments beyond the
       project closing date on their own.
   (c) All ULGs agreed to fully make the subproject investments used by the trades
       (functioning) and provide sufficient operation and maintenance budget to ensure that
       the facilities are functioning well and therefore give good service for the users.
   (d) Executing Agency will regularly monitor the ULGs through its provincial unit for
       planning and monitoring (“Satker Randal Provinsi”) and will provide incentive
       program for those who managed the subproject investment properly. The ULGs have
       to submit proposals to the EA (DG-Cipta Karya) to get this support based on their
       priority infrastructure development specified in the RPIJMD.

The summary of the commitment explain above was specified in the Memorandum of
Understanding signed between the ULG and CPMU. Number of participants in each of the
Exit Strategy Workshop is presented in the Table below.

During the LG stakeholders workshops, LGs also shared their views on the capacity building
(CB) activities provided by the project, which included training, on-the-job training,
workshop and direct technical assistance. In general, the capacity building activities have
generated positive impacts, among others:

(i) CB activities have contributed to the acceleration and strengthening of the achievement of
the reforms particularly the KPIs. Various regulations, standard procedures were established
and new practices were implemented. CB activities have increased ULGs staffs’ confidence
in implementing reforms, as in some cases, they were not fully supported by their colleagues
in the first place prior to the facilitation. Some training were directed to help the ULGs to
implement reform beyond those that in the KPIs. Various procurement reform training, for
instance, have accelerated and improved the establishment and functioning of Procurement
Service Unit (ULP) and the function of Procurement Anchor Unit (PAU), which were not
included as KPIs but important indicators in their reform agenda;
(ii) CB activities have helped the ULGs in shaping their ongoing reform agenda into a better
framework with measurable achievement indicators; some participants admitted that before
the project, they had implemented some reforms in line with the core urban reforms, but there
had been no clear direction or outputs/results that should be achieved;
(iii) CB activities helped the ULGs in understanding their position compare with USDRP and
non-USDRP participating ULGs in terms of achievement of reforms; this competition has
encouraged them to do better than their counterpart ULGs;
(iv) CB activities have facilitated ULGs in learning from peer-to-peer on new initiatives and
innovations in reforms; and obtaining information on “how to”, inspiring and triggering the
willingness to implement reforms; and
(v) CB activities have facilitated the networking platform with other ULGs. Participants from
many ULGs made their own visits to other ULGs including those that are not USDRP
participating ULGs, to learn and get more complete information and to find more suitable but
better reform implementation. Access of ULGs to the resource persons who presented their
experiences has increased and this has opened new working relationships.

However, most participants shared their concerns that CB activities could have been done in
the earlier of project implementation, particularly those related to the management of
subprojects (market, terminal and fish auction facility) and subproject preparation to help

them in preparing preparation documents such as workable subproject management scheme,
feasibility study, detailed engineering design, Resettlement Action Plan, etc.

National Stakeholders Workshop. The EA organized a National Exit Strategy workshop in
May 2013, co-chaired by the Director of Program Development in the EA and the Director of
Urban and Rural Affairs in BAPPENAS (IMSC). In this workshop, the IMSC and EA
suggested that USDRP was conceptually a good project that combined governance reform
and urban investment based on the ULGs’ priority needs. However, there were concerns that
should be improved in the future programs related to, among others: delays of project
implementation due to SLA processing and DIPA-SLA issuance, adoption of on-lending
scheme as the only option for ULGs for financing which limits types of subprojects that
could be financed under the project, delays in procurement for consultants, the task of the EA
that covered the reform component which was beyond its domain which therefore in the
future program there should be other PIUs established to manage governance reform; and
limited coverage of participating ULGs to only small and medium cities. The BAPPENAS as
a chair of the IMSC and also the TKPPN (National Coordinating Team for Urban
Development) committed to finalize the National Urban Strategy and Policy Development
(NUSPD) with a legal basis.

As an award, the EA committed itself to facilitate participating ULGs in the program for
infrastructure development under Cipta Karya for two years (2014-2015), with the following
conditions:
     ULGs show their proven commitment to operate and maintain the subproject
        investment,
     the proposed project has to be listed in the Medium Term Investment Development
        Plan (RPIJM) of the respective ULG,
     the proposed project has to be within the sector/s for which the EA (Cipta Karya) has
        a genuine mandate, and
     the proposed infrastructure project fulfills the readiness criteria set by Cipta Karya.

Annex 7        Summary of Borrower’s ICR and Comments on the Draft ICR

(a) Borrower’s Completion Report

The Borrower provided the Bank with a 161-page Project Completion Report in Bahasa,
which is archived in the project files. As there was no 10-page executive summary suitable
for reproduction in the ICR, the Bank team prepared the following summary translation of
key evaluative findings of the report.

Assessment of the achievement of Project objectives and outputs

1.     The Project Completion Report (PCR— Final Report was received on November 15,
2013) suggested that the Project has satisfactorily achieved its objective in reference to the
KPIs for both governance reform and urban investment components. However, although it
cannot be done at this point, the EA argued that the Project’s objective should have been also
measured in the context of a broader national urban development agenda where
decentralization is at work for achieving the “urban service standards” that is now being
developed by the Central Government.

2.      Based on the PBME Study, the EA is encouraged to note that all participating ULGs
are voluntarily committing themselves to continue implementing the reform agenda with or
without assistance from any parties which indicate sustainability of reform implementation
that will lead to stronger outcomes for public service delivery. Furthermore, although at
Project closing only part of the KPIs reflecting the outcomes of urban investment was
achieved, the Study showed that the used subprojects have already benefitted the public and
public perceived similar benefit for subprojects that will be used in the future. The EA
believed that monitoring in the next 1-2 years is needed to have information on the
sustainability of both reform implementation and the benefits of subprojects.

Assessment of Project implementation and main factors affecting project
implementation

3.       The Report suggested that Project implementation was a success due to the high
commitment of the IMSC, EA (particularly CPMU) and all participating ULGs, as well as
continuous strengthening of the Project management organizational structure, capacity, and
staff allocation. Achievements of most KPIs was attributed to the better functioning of the
IMSC in taking strategic decisions (i.e. ULG selection, Project restructuring, loan proceed
allocation, supporting the achievement of KPIs, coordination with the line ministries, etc.)
and to the improved capacity of CPMU in managing the Project along the course of
implementation, particularly after its restructuring, with the assignment of senior staff as the
head of CPMU, recruitment of full-timer and young staff (except the head of CPMU who
also hold structural position) with good technical capacity, and improved recruitments for its
Advisory and Management Consultant as well as for Consultant assigned to assist the ULGs.
The EA’s commitment was also shown by timely and sufficient budget provided to cover
operational costs, intensive supervisions and for capacity building activities as GOI’s
contributions to the loan and grants.




                                              65
4.       There were some constraints identified by the Report, however, that have affected the
Project implementation progress, which consequently, required the CPMU to continuously
adjust its strategy to maintain implementation momentum at the ULGs. First, a factor that
relates to quality of entry and at early stage of Project implementation whereby there were
changes in national regulations especially pertaining to on-lending mechanisms and
reforms and the limited understanding of the ULGs in the on-lending mechanisms. This
factor has reduced the speed of Project implementation at the early stage. Second, the
involvement of the line ministries in charge of guiding, overseeing and supervising ULGs in
governance reforms were limited due to high turnover of staff who were assigned to be
involved in the Project; their involvements in supervisions, meetings and workshops were
sporadic; units involved under the line ministries in some cases were not the ones who were
responsible for the said reform agenda; and, third, there was no explicit assignment for
particular units in the line ministries to be in charge of assisting ULGs in governance reform
with technical assistance attached to them.

5.      CPMU, have faced several main challenges during Project implementation, namely
among others: first, it has been organizationally (including staffing) restructured three times
in the effort to strengthen Project management capacity and to decentralize the day-to-day
Project management operation to mostly a non-structural staff; second, limited capacity of
the PMUs and PIUs in governance reform implementation and procurement particularly in
the early stage of Project implementation and limited capacity of PMUs in reporting to the
CPMU; third, Advisory and Management Consultant team and Reform Consultant teams for
assisting CPMU and ULGs in reform implementation were only mobilized in the second year
and the third year of Project implementation, respectively; fourth, limited capacity in
managing various Consultant Teams in the beginning of their mobilization; fifth, CPMU had
to lead the oversight and manage the implementation of the governance reforms at the ULG
level which was beyond its formal tasks; and, lastly, continuous changing of regulations and
rules at the national level on reforms and financing procedures, which were beyond the
control of CPMU, that have slower implementation pace. Despite this fact, the Report argued
that CPMU has satisfactorily carried out its tasks and function, particularly in managing and
coordinating the Project with IMSC including line ministries, and with ULGs, has been
effectively successful in communicating and maintaining effective diplomacy with the Bank
on substance and administrative matters. Project reporting has been improved and timely,
fiduciary and safeguards have been successfully managed, and website performance has been
in good quality. It was also successful in managing various Consultant teams.

6.      ULGs have continuously maintained their PMUs and PIUs with sufficient budget and
staff until Project closing despite the fact that there were some turnovers during Project
implementation. Some champions of governance reform in the local agency have been
established and leaders in PMUs are planning to continue the governance reform
implementation (mainly to improve quality) and to better operationalize the subproject
investments. The Report suggested that coordination between PMU and PIU in some ULGs
was not always good but was improving towards the Project closing; some PMUs faced
challenges in leading and coordinating the governance reform implementation as they were
carried out by various local agencies with limited capacity in the early stage of Project
implementation; some ULGs have faced procurement delays for construction as they were
unfamiliar with the World Bank requirements on procurements although they had been



                                              66
receiving various procurement training under the Project and given intensive guidance by the
CPMU, but this issues were no longer significant towards the Project closing.

7.      The Report suggested that the performance of Consultant Teams in general was
satisfactory. Amongst the five main Consultant Teams (contract packages), performance of
the Advisory Consultant and LED Consultant Team (central and local level) were
satisfactory, while the other three teams, i.e., Local Governance Reform and Individual
Consultants, UIDP-management Consultant team, and UIDP-NUSDP were moderately
satisfactory. As mentioned above, mobilization of these consultant teams were delayed due to
the complicated selection methods (mostly QCBS, even SSS method took a long time) and
worst, in one case of the Logistic Service Provider package was cancelled in the end of
Project period, and due to revisions of TORs; selection processes were not always in concert
with the budgeting process; some of the recruited experts were not adequately competent;
and some of the consultants could not work harmoniously and in synergy with their
colleagues as well as with CPMU and the Bank, resulting in a waste of time to continuously
only discussed the reform concept rather than implementing it with the consultant based in
each ULG. There were also some overlapping of tasks among Consultant Teams which led to
the inefficiency and difficulty for the CPMU to manage them.

8.      The scope of involvement of the World Bank during Project implementation was
extensive, and even some stakeholders thought that it sometimes was too far. This is
particularly for procurement. The CPMU argued that because there was incomplete
understanding on the Bank’s procurement procedures as specified in the Guidelines, several
misunderstanding took place between the Bank and CPMU on a particular procurement issue.
This is true in the case of Sawahlunto for instance, where information on the need to get a
Bank no objection was required if the duration of proposal submission of the bidders were
extended more than once during the procurement process. The Report mentioned that various
Project Progress Reports suggested that miscommunication in relation to procurement were
often occurred and hence, become significant issues that affect the project implementation
progress.

Assessment of achievements of KPIs, impacts, sustainability and lessons learned

9.      Overall assessment on the achievement of the project was considered as moderately
satisfactory. The Report suggested that most of the KPIs for reform component have been
achieved by the 10 ULGs and it was rated satisfactory, some ULGs have implemented
reforms beyond the KPIs. In addition, all of the KPIs on urban investment were fully
achieved whereby construction of all subprojects was completed. The TPA reform and
procurement reform were rated satisfactory whereas the financial management reform and
LED Strategy development were rated highly satisfactory. The rating for the later was
because of the high commitment of ULGs in implementing the strategy through budget
allocation from various local agencies and the establishment of “partnership forums” where
stakeholders discussed and agreed on the in LED Strategy and its implementation which in
most cases worked well.

10.     Beyond this, the Report also assessed the initial impacts of the reform activities by
Project closing, in terms of strengthening the institutional capacity of the ULGs with three
categories: first, ULGs (i.e. Parigi Moutong and Morowali) that had not been intervened or


                                             67
exposed to governance reform, and therefore, the Project triggered the implementation of
governance reform in these ULGs; second, ULGs (i.e., Barru, Sidenreng Rappang,
Pangkaraya, Parepare and Palopo) that to some extent had been exposed to or implemented
reforms with reasonable staff capacity. The third category were ULGs (i.e. Banda Aceh,
Sawahlunto, and Cimahi) that had been quite advance in reform and had good staff capacity
in implementing reform whereby the Project intervention was strengthening the ongoing
governance reform.

11.      The achievements of the reform in transparency, participation and accountability (TPA)
have contributed to the implementation of national regulation at the local government level. For
instance, through TPA activities, ULGs has implemented the requirements of the Law 14/2008
on Public Information Disclosure; Ministry of Home Affairs’ No. 33/2011 regulation pertaining
Complaint Handling in the Ministry and Local Government, and Law 25/2004 pertaining
National Planning System particularly the requirement for public participation in preparing
development planning document. In addition, various local regulations and Mayor Decrees were
issued to support the implementation of TPA activities, such as the Mayor/Bupati Decree on
Standards Operating Procedures for Complaint Handling (e.g. Barru). Another example of the
likely outcome and sustainability of the reform implementation activities is attributed to the
establishment of financial management regulations at the ULG level. With the legal basis, ULGs
will have to implement the reform.

12.     The Report argued that KPIs for urban investment were satisfactorily achieved as all of
the subprojects construction was completed prior to project closing date with reasonable quality,
and optimistic that all of the outcome indicators related to the urban investment will be fully
achieved once all subprojects are in operation in the future. Urban investment has changed the
living environment of the urban areas. The markets, for instance, have changed the urban
landscape with a better building and environment quality. Traders are able to do their businesses
in longer hours with better facility. If all markets are fully used in the future, they will
accommodate about 8,000 traders. As presented in Annex 5, most users (traders and consumers)
of the markets are more satisfied with the new facilities.

13.       Furthermore, in relation to sustainability, four areas specifically mentioned:
         Institutionalization of the reform, with the establishment of local regulations pertaining
          financial management reform, complaint handling, LED Strategy for instance, will
          ensure that local government staff will implement the reform agenda as part of their
          routine tasks in the bureaucratic system with financing from the local budget. This will
          ensure the sustainability of reform implementation, hence improve the quality of service
          delivery in the future
         Reform activities that have been supported by the project were only establishing a
          platform that would allow ULGs to proceed with further reform implementation. Positive
          practices should be disseminated to other local governments beyond USDRP
          participating ULGs. The EA should facilitate the achievement of the reform activities to
          relevant ministries at the central level, so that they could be adopted by the national
          polices or programs. The Book produced by the EA, i.e. “Promoting Urban Self-
          Reliance-Reflection of the USDRP Implementation” is one instrument to disseminate
          experiences including lessons learned from the project to the public.
         Bappenas is now finalizing the NUSPD/KSPPN (preparation was initiated by the project)
          with a plan to establish it as a Presidential Decree, of which policies and strategies for


                                                 68
        urban development specified in it will be incorporated in the next RPJMN. Lessons
        learned from the project can be considered as a reference for the RPJMN.
       Subproject management including business plan should have been planned at the early
        stage of project implementation. This is a key for the sustainability for the service
        provided by the subprojects (i.e. markets, bus terminal and fish auction market) and also
        to be able to repay the loan. Subproject management has been an issue discussed and
        addressed by the project since the last three years towards project closing through training
        and direct assistance to ULGs. This remains the critical challenge for ULGs in the future,
        although by project closing all subprojects have unit that managed them and budget
        allocation for operations and maintenance.

14.     Overall, the achievements of the project in both governance reform and urban investment
were claimed to be in line with and contributed to the relevant missions of specified in the
Strategic Plan of the EA 2010-2014, i.e. increase infrastructure in urban and rural areas; and
promote self-reliance local government through improved capacity of local government, public
and business entities. The project objectives and achievement were also in line with the Bank’s
CPS that promote development in Indonesia through strengthening local capacity and improve
economic competitiveness of the private sector that targeting pro-growth, pro-job, and pro-poor.

15.     One of the lessons learned noted by the EA was that the roles and leaderships of the
Mayor or Bupati is one of the key for important factors that contributed to the success of reform
implementation. The adoption of the regulation pertaining reform at the operational level within
the bureaucracy is depended on the courage and commitment of the Mayor/Bupati. This
particularly true for instance, for the publication of the audited financial management report,
whereby not all Mayor/Bupati were ready to implement this.

16.     Another lessons learned that was noted by the EA was that legal basis such as regulations
or technical guidelines issued by both central government and local government are needed by
the ULGs to proceed with the reform implementation and ensure the sustainability. Furthermore,
using information technology such as websites for disclosures, and complaint handling for
instance, should be equipped with sufficient hardware and software, as well as staffing that have
good capacity in administering and operating the websites. This is important factor to ensure
sustainability of the TPA activities.

17.    In reference to the PBME Study, the Report argued that the public is happy with the
more information available for the public and the officials working in financial management
are more comfortable because of the more transparent situation. Overall, the based on the
PBME survey, the ULGs’ staff/officials dealing with planning, financial management and
procurement are happy and more comfortable in working in a more transparent situation.

18.     For the LED Strategy, it apparently got a strong enthusiasm and support from
stakeholders because the implementation of this strategy will increase their income, despite
the fact that there is no national or local regulations that govern the LED. Another factor of
the strong support for the LED by all stakeholders including private businesses, local
government and NGOs was that because it did not involve that much political interest like
other reform. The project is in fact published a Guideline for Implementing the LED and also
develop a model on the process of preparing an LED Strategy.



                                                69
19.      Capacity building (CB). CB consists of training, on-the job training, workshops and
direct technical assistance. The project was considered successful in motivating ULGs to
establish regulations or policies at the local level. The CB was also successful in facilitating
the communication and innovations among ULGs and between USDRP’s ULGs and non
USDRP ULGs in governance reform. CPMU has delivered all of the planned CB activities,
however, some were beyond the plan, such as on-the-job training to neighboring countries for
LED and green cities. Interviews with ULGs’ officials suggested that they found out that CB
activities were very useful and they were satisfied. However, some of the trained officials
were rotated to other position, which in many cases not relevant to the training. The training
method was also tailored to the achievement of the KPIs. The activities of CB during the
preparation of LED Strategy (almost in about 9 months) have managed to generate agent of
change in each ULG who become a champion for the implementation of the strategy.

Performance of the Borrower and the Bank

20.       IMSC was expected to have strong roles in supervising the project implementation
progress and in preparing the urban development policy. The IMSC members have become
part of the National Coordinating team for Urban Development (TKPP) under the leadership
of Bappenas. During project implementation, the Report noted that:
(i) IMSC has regular coordination meetings with its line ministry members in the last 4 years
of project implementation. This has been very effective in improving the knowledge of
ministries beyond MPW about USDRP’s activities and progress.
(ii) Performance of IMSC was not optimal because not all line ministry members have the
same level of “interest”.
(iii) As the members of the IMSC were echelon 1 officials, there were difficulties in taking
practical and fast decision making. This has influenced the project performance.
(iv) It is recommended that for future projects, the IMSC should focus on supervision on the
policy implementation with better and effective standard operating procedures. It is suggested
that the role of IMSC is given to the existing more established organization for instance the
National Agency for Spatial development (BKTRN), MP3EI, TKPKN, etc.

21.     Performance of the Executing Agency, was rated “satisfactory” because of its strong
commitment to implement the project, continuously improved the project management and
implementation strategy, had a solid project monitoring and evaluation through an MIS, had
carried out good reporting in a relatively timely manner, and coordinated well internally
(MPW-Cipta Karya) and with other line ministries and the Bank.

22.     Performance of the Bank at project entry, was rated satisfactory due to (i) continuity
of the team members in charge from project preparation to implementation; (ii) project
design had been consulted widely with stakeholders; (iii) have good communication and
policy in the urban sector and similar experiences in other places; (iv) had shared interest in
urban development that accelerate project start. In addition, the World Bank was seen as very
helpful and had sufficient resources in assisting the EA prepare project documents; (v) had
good cooperation with the GoI in project preparation and in mobilizing the PHRD grants to
support governance reform.

23.     Performance of Bank in supervision, was rated satisfactory with reasons: (i)
satisfactory supervision quality; (ii) supervisions were done in timely manner, regular, and
included technical and substance. CPMU appreciated the continuous support of the Bank

                                              70
during the project implementation. (iii) World Bank gave full support to the EA in
accelerating project implementation with good identification of main problems and gave
solutions to GoI and CPMU. After CPMU was organizationally stable equipped with
sufficient technical staff, the World Bank team gave full support focusing on project
implementation. The performance of the World Bank was assessed in nine areas: (i)
procurement, financial management; (iii) capacity building; (iv) core governance reform; (v)
social safeguards; (vi) environmental safeguards; (vii) project restructuring/loan
amendments; (viii project management, and (ix implementation of Component B (urban
investment). Amongst these nine areas, three, i.e. social safeguards, environmental
safeguards and project restructuring, were rated “very good”; while the other six areas were
rated “good”.

Performance of Consultants and Contractors

24.     Performance of Contractors. During project implementation, there were 15 contract
packages for civil works and 49 consultant packages. Overall, implementation of all of these
packages was in line with the contracts including the deliverables. Performance of
contractors, particularly in terms of schedule for physical construction, was influenced by the
timely of the DIPA-SLA issuance. Delays in subproject completion in Sawahlunto, Banda
Aceh, Morowali, barru and Palangkaraya were due to the late issuance of this budget
document. Furthermore, increase in construction costs was inevitable for most subprojects
because of the delay in procurement, increase price of some materials during the 2008
economic crisis, adjustment of technical specification, and mistakes in the bill of quantity
document. Delays in the completion of subproject construction were also due to the
shortcomings of construction materials availability (Morowali, Sawahlunto, Banda Aceh,
Parigi Moutong, and Cimahi), geographical constraint (Morowali), the 2008 economic crisis
where imported construction materials became more expensive, and social issues whereby
the traders wanted to move to temporary market only after the Moslem new year
(Sawahlunto).

25. Performance of Consultants.         Consultant packages were arranged in response to the
need for assisting ULGs in achieving the KPIs and the dynamics of project implementation.
Procurement Plan was updated accordingly. Since project restructuring, packaging and
method for consultant selection were carefully design not only to respond to the need, but
also to accelerate selection process. CPMU faced a challenge to coordinate and manage many
consultants from at least three large packages whereby there were many overlapping of tasks.
CPMU also had limited capacity in overseeing and supervising the consultants including their
outputs due to its limited expertise in governance reform. Performance quality of the
consultant in many cases was carried out by the Bank’s team. Quality of the consultant varied
and the project suffered from having some of unqualified, hence non-performing experts. The
most challenging issues were the performance and quality of the outputs produced by the
consultant teams. Individual hiring was proven to be more effective in terms of providing
direct technical assistance to ULGs, however, management, sharing information,
coordination, and supervision were more difficult for the CPMU.

(a) Borrower’s Comments on Draft ICR

          Project Design
           o     In concept, the reform and investment components were expected to
                 support each other in underpinning the development of self-reliant and
                 sustainable urban area. However, in the implementation phase, these
                 components seemed to be not directly related. One of the reasons was that
                 the executing agency did not have any authority to conduct assessment on
                 the quality of governance reform implemented by local government. The
                 authority to supervise the quality of reform was only limited to the project
                 implementation, and more to the point, this was not done in sustainable
                 manner by the executing agency.
           o     The USDRP approach was sectoral-based and did not use any regional
                 approach. As the consequence, the achievement of the project could
                 neither be portrayed at city scale nor compared with other regions in
                 Indonesia. For this reason, it is proposed that the future technical
                 assistance package should be in form of an integrated program which is
                 regional based, multi-sector and multi-source of funding in nature.

          Project Institutionalization
           o     The designation of Directorate General of Human Settlement, the Ministry
                 of Public Works as the executing agency was carried out based on the
                 directorate general’s experience in implementing IUIDP project
                 management in the 1980s-1990s era. However, the appointment of
                 Directorate General of Human Settlement, the Ministry of Public Works as
                 the sole Executing Agency for the USDRP project was unfortunately less
                 effective due to the fact that the directorate general neither had any
                 authority nor suitable competency in fostering the reform agenda. The over
                 extensive governance reform menu brought some difficulties to the
                 executing agency in assessing the quality of reform achievement as the
                 agency simply relied on its own resources.
           o     In the future similar project, there should be a strengthening role on the
                 existence of the Steering Committee. This is due to the reasoning and
                 understanding that urban development project highly requires proper cross-
                 sector cooperation. It is the truism that urban development is not
                 only involving physical           development but also strengthening urban
                 management institution so as to such institution is ready and able to cope
                 with       the      daunting    challenges of      decentralization    era.
                 The existence of IMSC in the USDRP is very effective in providing cross-
                 sector communication         medium      to solve problems that     cannot
                 be handled alone by the Executing Agency. It should be noted that this role
                 could be more strengthened if there is similar agenda in promoting
                 governance reform agenda among its members.

          Participation
           The resignation of a number of urban local governments from their participants
           in the USDRP in the first 3 years of its implementation was severely affecting
           the project performance. From 13 urban local governments that participated in
           the project at the early stage of its implementation after the signing of Loan

                                            72
    Agreement, some 8 of them withdrawn themselves from the participation for
    various reasons. This brought implication of a very low disbursement
    performance in the early years of project implementation. Consequently, the
    executing agency carried out project restructuring in 2010 to adjust the KPIs and
    project performance to the condition of ULG’s participation.

   Project Management
    o     The project’s institutional arrangement at the central level, for IMSC or
          CPMU, was carried out appropriately and proportionally since the
          beginning of the project. However, the implementation was not equipped
          with the SOP and complete organizational governance. In the future, the
          institutional form, especially related to the participant verification, should
          be carried out with simple procedure and criteria without sidelining the
          principles of bureaucracy and prudency in accordance with existing rules
          and regulations.
    o     The hierarchy and communication approach among project implementers
          at central and local level need to be rearranged by taking into account the
          decentralization pattern that is currently on going, especially in Monitoring
          and Reporting aspect.
    o     Project implementers at central and local level often had different
          understanding with the World Bank regarding Procurement, Safeguards,
          project management and others aspects. Such different understanding was
          also often led to the delay in the issuance of No Objection Letter and this,
          of course, affected the progress speed of the project. We suggest that this
          should be well arranged and agreed upon from the beginning of the
          project.

   Financing Mechanism
    o    In the early stage of project preparation, USDRP was designed with the
         Open menu approach, which means that local governments are given
         flexibility in proposing the type of infrastructure according to the needs
         and possible funding schemes. The use of grant scheme is not allowed by
         the Ministry of Finance due to the existence of General Allocation Fund
         (DAU) and Special Allocation Fund (DAK) mechanism. The Ministry of
         Finance has required the financing to be done in accordance with
         subsidiary loan mechanism based on the Decree of the Minister of Finance
         No. 35/2003. This policy brings the implication to urban investment
         financing scheme that is limited to the cost recovery sub-project. The
         option of infrastructure sectors to be intervened becomes very limited to
         sectors that generate benefits in the form of local revenue. This has raised
         the impression that USDRP is a sectoral-based project which simply
         develop market infrastructure. However, the subsidiary loan scheme can
         still be developed for other projects. The issuance of Government
         Regulation No. 30 of 2011 on Regional Loan has provided an opportunity
         for local governments to make loan for the purposes of infrastructure
         development that do not have any direct impact in the form of income to
         local-owned revenue or revenue generating project. With such regulation,
         local governments are having more flexibility to propose the type of
         activities/infrastructures to be funded through such regional loan. The

                                      73
          Ministry of Finance has also established the Government Investment
          Center (PIP) to facilitate local governments who want to make loan, but is
          limited in the form of medium-term loan.
    o     The use of local loan scheme in upcoming projects needs to be preceded
          by the improvement and rearrangement of the SLA Mechanism. The
          improvement of such mechanism should primarily focus on accelerating
          business processes so as to the project will not be preoccupied with the
          constantly changing administrative process which can slow down the
          performance of the project.

   Project Sustainability
    o     With regard to operational aspect, all of USDRP participating local
          governments showed their commitment to operate the infrastructures built.
          Problems faced by local governments related to the operating of the
          markets were, among others, political commitment, institutional issues and
          the determination of tariff. This situation brought difficulty to the project
          in measuring the outcome indicators at the end of loan period, because
          some of infrastructures were just operated in less than a year at that time.
    o     For the implementation of reform aspect, the local government has
          prepared the sustainability of governance reform initiative through the
          formulation of local regulation and institutional establishment. With the
          local regulation, the USDRP places great expectation to local governments
          that they will consistently and wholeheartedly implement the governance
          reform post to the end of the project with their own resources. At the
          central government level, the executing agency has informed the relevant
          ministries regarding the performance and challenges encountered during
          the implementation of each reform agenda at the end of the
          project. Additionally, the executing agency has also published some
          publications of hands-on assistance results of governance reform
          aspect. This is, of course, expected to be the input for the institutions at the
          central level to replicate or adopt this initiative to the policy and regulation
          to be drafted. However, the project document does not specify any
          obligation to Ministries/State Institutions to make replication of
          governance reform initiatives by USDRP.

Additional Annex 10:      Eligibility Criteria for ULGs and
                          For Subprojects under Component B (from PAD)

Eligibility of ULGs Seeking Project Financing

Eligibility Criteria for ULGs. The participating ULGs have met the following eligible
criteria:
     (a) meet entry conditions for core governance reforms (issue a mayor’s decree/SK
          on key governance reforms and their action plans),
     (b) prepare Urban Development Strategies and 5-year PJMs (Medium-Term
          Development Plans);
     (c) possess adequate borrowing capacity; and
     (d) not have any outstanding arrears. When a ULG has debt exceeding its current
          repayment capacities, an agreement on debt rescheduling should be finalized
          between the ULG and MOF.


Eligibility Criteria for Subprojects under Component B

The following criteria were used to select the subprojects:
    (a) should be infrastructure projects;
    (b) should be cost recovery projects (definition of cost recovery project is available
         in the project file);
    (c) should not be a national project;
    (d) should be initiated and undertaken under the authority of the proposing ULG;
    (e) should result in benefits to public services in the ULG;
    (f) should be approved by the DPRD of the proposing ULG;
    (g) should be based on the ULG’s urban development strategy and be identified in
         the PJM as priority;
    (h) should adopt proven and cost-effective technology based on approved technical
         norms and specifications;
    (i) cost-recovery subprojects should generate a FRR of at least the on-lending rate
         of subsidiary loan agreement, in principle. Where cost recovery subprojects
         cannot generate adequate FRR due to externalities or other strategic reasons, the
         ULG should clearly state the minimum cost recovery target as well as the level

As shown above, there was a range of underlying reasons for the withdrawal from the
project of eight ULGs, after the PAD had been written. There were even more ULGs that
had shown interest in the project during preparation stage but did not follow through or
were not selected.

Particularly discouraging were the changes to the eligibility criteria during Project
preparation. In the early phases of Project preparation, it was communicated to the ULGs
that funding for their proposed subprojects could be either through on-granting or through
on-lending (in accordance with the relevant document named KMK35/2003– see
Additional Annex 14). Subsequently, it was communicated that subprojects would only
be funded through on-lending, and full cost recovery was required. However, ULGs
found it very difficult to demonstrate full cost recovery, and so the requirement was
softened again to the effect that subprojects had to be only revenue generating. Hereby,

                                                     79
the required proportion of investment cost and revenue collected was not specified. This
enabled ULGs to design subprojects with realistic financial parameters. Even so, ULGs’
freedom to select subprojects that had high priority from their point of view was severely
restricted.

In any case, interested ULGs had to submit to the government for examination, and for
endorsement by the IMSC, a feasibility study which clearly demonstrated in an accepted
methodology that the intended subproject met the selection/approval criteria incl. its
financial feasibility. ULGs that prepared their feasibility studies during the Project’s
official preparation phase received some support from consultants. On the other hand,
ULGs that became interested in the Project during its implementation phase only had no
access to such support and found it difficult to meet the quality standards of the
government and the Bank. The necessary repeated revisions of application documents
were very time and resource consuming. For this reason the ULG of Solok Selatan could
eventually not join the Project. The ULG of Sorong lost interest again after it had learned
that the loan funds would not be channeled through the local treasury and the option to
restrict bidding to contractors from Papua Province, permissible under Indonesian law,
was not acceptable under World Bank procurement rules.

Additional Annex 14:         Changes in National Legislation, National Policy, and
                             National Institutions Relevant to the Project

When the Project was conceived, the legal groundwork for Indonesia’s decentralization
had been laid, especially through Law No. 22 of 1999 and Law No. 25 of 1999. These
Acts redefined the roles and responsibilities of local governments as well as the fiscal
system that was to enable local governments to fulfill those roles and meet those
responsibilities. Subsequently to those Acts, several pertinent Government Regulations
were issued (notably Nos. 25, 104, and 107, all of 2000). Finally, and on this basis, the
Decision of the Minister of Finance code named KMK35 was issued in January 2003, to
regulate the requirements and processes for on-lending or on-granting of foreign loans to
local governments.

KMK35/2003 was thus already in place when the preparations for the Project began. In
the early stages of Project preparation it was envisaged that local governments would be
permitted to propose various kinds of subprojects, not limited to an on-lending modality.
Later during the preparation, however, national policy was that all subprojects under this
Project should be financed through on-lending only. Initially, full cost recovery was
expected but this was softened later on, and only “revenue generating” (not necessarily
full cost recovery) was expected.

During the preparation of the Project, further changes were made to the legal framework:
Law No. 32 of 2004 and Law No. 33 of 2004 modified Law No. 22 of 1999 and Law No.
25 of 1999, and Law No. 32 of 2004 itself was modified again through Government
Regulation in Lieu of Law No. 3 of 2005. The legal framework was further changed by
Government Regulations Nos. 54, 55, and 58, all of 2005, and No. 2 of 2006.

On that basis, the Regulation of the Minister of Finance code named PMK53 was issued
in July 2006. It supersedes and replaces Decision No. KMK35/2003. Its requirements for
borrowing by local governments are significantly stricter than those of KMK35/2003;
amongst others, it demands an intensive involvement and written commitment of local
parliament. It also demands that all land acquisition and resettlement be done before
negotiations on a possible SLA can begin.

Obviously, the Regulation of the Minister of Finance PMK53/2006 made it difficult and
time consuming for additional interested ULGs to join the Project after 2006. One
interested ULG could not complete its documentation with the speed that would have
allowed it to join the Project under the given time pressure (see also Additional
Annex 12). Those additional interested ULGs that continued to pursue participation in the
Project had to expend considerable resources because they did not have the intensive
support of consultants as had those ULGs that had prepared their participation in 2004.

Given this high threshold of formal/legal requirements for interested ULGs, the
practicability of obtaining funding through SLAs has come under critical review, and the
feasibility of financing through a new facility established by GoI has been pondered (see
also Additional Annex 15). The facility in question is the Pusat Investasi Pemerintah


                                           83
(PIP), or Indonesia Investment Agency, established by GoI in 2007. The feasibility and
practicability of financing local government investments from or through this agency
and/or other financial intermediaries should be examined in the conception of future
urban development projects.

Summing up, it can be stated that the Project operated in a legal environment whose
volatility and changeability had apparently been underestimated during preparation. The
Project design shows no mechanisms for dealing with such changes and adapting the
Project as may become necessary.

The volatility and changeability of the legal framework was one reason why the signing
of SLAs and subsequent subproject implementation became much more time consuming
that had been assumed during preparation, and this resulted in the need to extend the loan
closing date twice which cannot be held against the EA, the implementing agencies, or
the Bank team.

Additional Annex 15:         Views Expressed in the Publication “USDRP –
                             Promoting Urban Self-Reliance. Reflection of the
                             USDRP Implementation”

The above mentioned volume was published by the CPMU in 2012 under the editorial
oversight of the EA’s Director of Program Development. It was written by a neutral
author, a well-known journalist from a major national newspaper. GoI and the Bank
appreciate that the EA has taken this unusual initiative to have reflections on the USDRP
compiled, in an effort to reach a wider audience and facilitate a public discussion beyond
the usual project reports. Amongst others, this publication contains the views of
     the EA’s Director General, Mr. Budi Yuwono P.,
     the EA’s Director of Program Development, Mr. Antonius Budiono,
     the head of the CPMU, Mr. Dwityo A. Soeranto,
     consultant to the Executing Agency for UIDP-Management package, urban
       development specialist, Mr. Hendropranoto Suselo,
     the Director of Urban and Rural Affairs in Bappenas (National Development
       Planning Board), Ms. Hayu Parasati, and
     the Director of Regional Funding and Capacity in the Ministry of Finance, Mr.
       Adriansyah.

Views expressed by these persons include the following:

Budi Yuwono P.

Subprojects should be selected more carefully; those burdening local government budgets
should really be intended for the good of low-income communities. In these cases, a
subsidy from the government may indeed be appropriate. Other potentially self-financing
projects should preferably be left to the private sector, with financing from the banking
sector, which can be more efficient.

The processing of SLAs by central government was very time consuming. In the future,
there should be a more agile team to make critical decisions quickly. Tendering and
procurement processes could also have been faster with a different implementation
arrangement.

From the perspective of need, USDRP should be continued and we will encourage it, but
with a more practical mechanism and possibly not financed from foreign loans.

The USDRP is very good and should be continued, provided there is improvement in two
issues: reform in central government, and more scrupulous selection of subprojects.
There are still heads of local governments whose mindsets are project oriented, sidelining
the reform aspects.

Dwityo A. Soeranto

The processing of SLAs was very time consuming because, besides the central
government, the House of Representatives also needed to agree to each SLA. The
protracted procedures caused some local governments to lose interest in the project.

Lack of capacity on the part of local government personnel and lack of specific
experience with World Bank procedures proved to be another obstacle to speedy project
implementation.

MPW has supported some local governments’ subprojects by implementing supporting
projects (e. g. drainage) in parallel.

Hendropranoto Suselo

The project management team of the MPW as the EA has done a tremendous job that
should definitely be appreciated.

Supervision is performed on all elements of project management except the Bank itself.
The enormous authority and domination of the Bank is dangerous, considering that staff
of the management and implementation in the Bank side has modest experiences,
especially in the bureaucracy and technical aspect compared to those of the Executing
Agency and consultants.

Between the institutions that build the physical assets and those responsible for the
operation and functioning of those assets there is a gap that should be avoided by better
communication and coordination.

Governance reforms could be and have been carried out by local governments even
without USDRP, e. g. with support from USAID.

Governance reform has followed the classical pattern by following guidance that has
been prepared in a top-down manner, neglecting the fact that each local government has
its own characteristics, and something good for one may not necessarily be good for
another.

The IMSC has not been utilized optimally for the benefit of the success of the national
agenda on local governance reform. The IMSC should also discuss its evaluation of the
USDRP and possible next steps.

More coordination is needed between the various international institutions that support
governance reform.

There is need to carry out a comprehensive evaluation of USDRP to define the strategy
and follow-up program, and discuss and agree on this in the IMSC forum.

USDRP can be regarded as a very good role model and should be replicated in other local
governments. It should be evaluated and if there is a continuation the new program
should make no mistakes in choosing its subprojects.

In implementing USDRP, governance reform should have come first, followed by
physical implementation. In reality, the implementation pattern was different.

Currently, the rule is that subprojects financed from loans should be revenue-generating,
even profitable. This may be in conflict with local governments’ obligation to provide
services and should thus be changed to accommodate economic and social benefits as
well.

Since the processing of SLAs was very time consuming, local governments may propose
financing by applying to the Indonesia Investment Agency (or Pusat Investasi
Pemerintah - PIP) that already exists and tries to cut short the time consuming foreign
loan procedures.

Additional Annex 16:          Case Study: Subproject Market Reconstruction in
                              Sawahlunto

Sawahlunto in West Sumatra Province is a small city of rather special nature. Its
existence does not go back to a traditional market settlement or town. Instead, it was
established in 1888 by the Dutch colonial administration for one specific purpose, namely
to be the administrative center for managing the operations at the coal mines in nearby
Ombilin. For this reason, a dedicated railway line was built from Padang City (the
provincial capital on the coast) and to Sawahlunto.

Sawahlunto city played this specific role for more than hundred years and housed the
head office of the mining company and its employees as well as the service population
needed to sustain them. The city’s population rose to a maximum of approx. 43,000 in
1930 but dropped back to about 15,000 in 1990 as a result of the steady decline of the
coal mining operations. The railway line has been defunct since 2000.

In 1990, the administrative area of the city was expanded from approx. 8 sq. km to
approx. 273 sq.km. Its total population in 2010 was approx. 57,000. About three quarters
of these, however, live in rural areas of the city’s territory. There is little room for the
physical expansion of the city center as it is located in a narrow valley, the upper reaches
of the Lunto River.

The economic decline of the city’s economic fortunes compelled the leaders to think of
an alternative economic basis for its existence, i. e. a comprehensive economic revival
strategy. Especially under the leadership of its mayor from 2003 till 2013, the city
administration focused on the development of tourism, including three key projects: (1) a
zoo, (2) a water park, and (3) a cable car operation to a hilltop that overlooks the city
center. The water park and the cable car projects were presented to Indonesia’s central
government with the request for financial support. This included the option that either
project would be included in the scope of the USDRP. The IMSC supported the proposal.
MoF, however, argued that this kind of projects was more suitable for private sector
investment or a public-private partnership as it required a competent operation and
management with a view to sustained commercial viability. The city then decided to
propose a renovation of its central market as subproject under the USDRP, and this was
accepted. The cable car project is still pending but the zoo and the water park projects
have meanwhile been implemented with private sector involvement. With this, the city
has now become fairly attractive for domestic tourists (especially from the adjacent oil-
rich province of Riau), and the further development of this tourism is one element of the
city’s economic revival strategy.

The market renovation covered two of the three buildings that together make up
Sawahlunto’s central market. A key feature of the whole project was the strong
involvement of the market traders’ association from the start. This facilitated the
temporary relocation of the affected market traders. For this temporary relocation, a piece
of idle land was made available by the railway company. As this land is adjacent to the
market, separated from it only by a street and the defunct railway track, there were no
significant grievances from the market traders. Provision of temporary market stalls by


                                            88
the city was part of the subproject. The market traders’ community was somewhat
divided over the question of the optimum timing for the relocation (both to the temporary
market and back to the newly renovated market), depending on the nature of their
business (some of them are rather seasonal, with e. g. clothing traders doing most of their
business during the Islamic fasting month). These divisions were overcome mainly by the
competent facilitation of the association’s leaders, and traders were allowed to move at
the time that hurt their business least. This flexibility greatly enhanced the acceptance of
the inevitable inconveniences associated with the renovation.

The architectural design for the new buildings was deliberately chosen to be reminiscent
of colonial art deco style, paying heed to the city’s peculiar history. The market is a three-
story structure with shops in the bottom two floors and semi-open space for smaller
traders and food/drink stalls on the third level (see photographs overleaf). It also has an
escalator in the main hall of the bigger building. Such a feature may seem extravagant for
a market of a small city but was included upon specific request of the traders during early
consultations. This is to make the market modern-looking and attractive for tourists.
Access ramps to the second and third level serve mobility impaired users (see photos
overleaf).

The two new buildings comprise over 140 shop lots, each with an area of approx. 11 sq.
m. For the allocation of these shop lots, the PMU temporarily considered a clustering
(with shops dealing in similar goods being close to one another). However, it was
realized that this would lead to protracted debates among the traders because, inevitably,
some parts of the building are more exposed to the flow of shoppers and therefore more
attractive for sellers than others. The idea was therefore dropped again. The market
traders’ association advocated an allocation of shop lots through ballot-drawing as the
virtually only means to forestall protracted discussions and disputes, and this was
eventually implemented.

An important element of urban management reform was a redefinition of the tenure
patterns for shop lots. Previously, like in many other markets in Indonesia, numerous
shop lots had been leased from the city by individuals who had been quickest (or most
well-connected) to secure the rights although they were not necessarily doing business
themselves. Instead, those individuals often sub-let the shops lot to other individuals, and
even these were often brokers rather than traders. This tenure pattern led to inflated shop
rents for the end users, with unjustified gains for well-connected middlemen and rent
seekers at the expense of both traders and shoppers. It has to be borne in mind that this
kind of petty corruption and rent seeking was one of the main triggers for the widespread
public demands for governance reforms from 1998 onward. Compared to some other
ULGs, Sawahlunto appears to be more committed to, and successful in, eradicating rent
seeking.

Under the emphatic leadership of its mayor from 2003 to 2013 (a businessman himself)
the ULG introduced the rule that primary tenants had to be actively involved in trading,
and the sub-letting of shop lots was no longer allowed. Shop lots would be handed over
to the tenants against a cash deposit of IDR 7 million (approx. USD 700), and violators of



                                             89
the rules would have their tenure revoked and the keys seized without reimbursement of
the depositor any investment they had made into the shop lot.

It is worth noting that the lease/rental contracts for the shops/kiosks in the market contain
the explicit clause that the lease/rental rates will be reviewed regularly. This was done so
that the city would be able to fully recover the cost and financially break even over the
market’s utilization period (until 2031). The cash flow projection that shows the rental
income, including the regular increases that will just suffice to repay the SLA by 2031,
was communicated to the traders very transparently which led to fairly universal support.
Through the acceptance of regular increases over time, the rental rates could be kept low
in the early years of operation.

In June 2013 traders began to move from the temporary market into the new market
buildings that had visibly been completed to very satisfactory design and construction
standards. A technical limitation is that fish, meat, and vegetable traders still occupy a
separate facility located beside the new market, that lacks proper wastewater
collection/treatment. Those interventions were not included in the USDRP subproject as
they would have exceeded the available budget and construction time. The city is now
upgrading those facilities as well as the access lanes and parking lots from its own
resources.

This subproject demonstrates the mutual support between an investment project and
governance reforms, especially in the field of transparency and participation. The ULGs
communication with the traders was exemplary:
    before implementation began, there were intensive consultations about the project
       in general and the buildings’ design in particular,
    the ULG communicated very clearly the plans and mechanisms for moving the
       traders (first to a temporary site and then back to the newly renovated market)
       including the provision of a temporary site by the ULG as part of the subproject,
    the ULG communicated very openly and transparently how rental rates had to be
       fixed so that the project could recover its cost and the ULD could repay its SLA.

The reconstruction of the Sawahlunto market is an important element of a more
comprehensive revival strategy for the city’s economy, and substantial improvements to
the market’s future management contribute to a governance reform that will directly
benefit traders and shoppers, in addition to the wider governance reform objectives
reflected in the KPIs.
