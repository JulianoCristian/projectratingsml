consists of the following: (i) construction and equipment of\n            three wells and a pumping station including the development\n            of three springs; (ii) construction of a reservoir,\n            transmission and distribution pipelines including house\n            connections and water meters; (iii) construction of three\n            intakes and pipelines; (iv) improvements and repairs to\n            existing water supply facilities, new maintenance facilities\n            including vehicles, buildings and equipment for data\n            collection and billings; (v) drilling and testing six\n            exploratory wells; (vi) construction of about 40 km of\n            sewers including waste stabilization ponds at Dobighat and\n            Kodku; (vii) institutional and on-the-job training of WSSB\n            staff; and (viii) engineering and management services to\n            complete the project, and conduct a tariff study and\n            feasibility studies and detailed engineering for future construction."}, "docdt": "1974-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
