2.       Overall progress toward the achievement of the project objective is satisfactory.
The last Implementation Status Report rated both PDO and IP satisfactory. Various
studies on Sustainable Land Management have been completed. There has also been an
upgrading of GIS Software and purchase of GIS equipment. The quality assurance group
review exercise of the Bank for the project was carried out during this reporting period.
The reviewers compared the progress of work done by the project since inception with
the expectation as contained in the grant agreement and all other project related
documents. At the close of review, the reviewers recommended the following; (a) The
need to empower the SWS members in the states to follow-up and provided add-on
activities on sub-projects implementation and (b) The need to increase disbursement, and
speedy completion of on-going ground water studies. The M&E manual is also being
implemented.
    Disbursement
3.      Disbursement is currently USD 7.2 million representing about 71.91 percent of
the total grant amount.

4.      The proposed reallocation is necessary based on a letter dated August 11, 2010, in
which the Federal Government of Nigeria requested a reallocation of the funds. The
relocation is to provide additional funds in the sum of USD of USD 374,000 and USD
920,000 to the Training/Workshop and Incremental Operating Cost Expenditure
categories respectively to execute the identified critical activities that would ensure
successful implementation and completion of the GEF programme. The low amounts in
these categories are hampering the implementation of time sensitive activities in these
categories.

5.       The Mid Term Review (MTR) and subsequent supervision missions
recommended that the State Watershed Committee (SWSs) be empowered to provide
advisory services to the communities. This can only be captured in operating costs as the
activities of the SWSs are funded under this category. Forest Management committees
have been formed in the six intervention sites to implement the Forest Management Plans
prepared by the project. The funding for the implementation of the forest management
plans are also captured under operating cost, hence the increase in the reallocation
compared to the appraisal estimate.
