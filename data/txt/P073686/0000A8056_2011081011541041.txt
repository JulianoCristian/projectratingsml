                         The overall implementation of the project has been very significant. To date, the project has been able to disburse about 99.8% of the grant. State Watershed Subcommittees (SWS)
                         have been established and are functional in the six participating states. The SWS andkey project officials in the participating state were trained on sustainable integrated agriculture at
                         Songhai farms, Benin Republic. The six participating states have received the balances for the second batch of Local Development Plans (LDPs). The study on improved
                         management of ground water has been completed with each of the six intervention sites having three water monitoring wells. The project conducted studies on sustainable
