     The reallocation is necessary based on a letter dated August\n            11, 2010, in which the Federal Government of Nigeria\n            requested a reallocation of the funds. The relocation is to\n            provide additional funds in the sum of USD of USD 374,000\n            and USD 920,000 to the training/workshop and incremental\n            operating cost expenditure categories respectively to\n            execute the identified critical activities that would ensure\n            successful implementation and completion of the programme.\n            The low amounts in these categories are hampering the\n            implementation of time sensitive activities in these\n            categories. The funding for the implementation of the forest\n            management plans are also captured under operating cost,\n            hence the increase in the reallocation compared to the\n            appraisal estimate."}, "docdt": "2010-08-23T00:00:00Z"}
