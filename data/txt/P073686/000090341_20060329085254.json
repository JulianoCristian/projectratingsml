sustainably increase\n            the incomes of fadama users, those who depend directly or\n            indirectly on fadama resources (fanners, pastoralists,\n            fishers, hunters, gatherers, and service providers), through\n            empowering communities to take charge of their own\n            development agenda, and by reducing conflict between fadama\n            users. The project has the following components: (1) The aim\n            of this component is to build the capacity of fadama users\n            and other key stakeholders. (2) This component addresses the\n            technical, social and location-specific activities to\n            improve the management of critical watersheds that ensure\n            fadama productivity and sustainability in a few (pilot)\n            areas with high potential for upscaling and replicability.\n            (3) This component supports a range of advisory services,\n            training, information sharing, awareness programs, and\n            adoption of land use practices that will enable fadama users\n            to adopt productivity-enhancing techniques and more\n            profitable marketing, and at the same time ensure the\n            sustainability of the fadama resource base. (4) This\n            component focuses on project management mechanisms,\n            including monitoring and evaluation plans to implement\n            Fadama II."}, "docdt": "2006-03-20T00:00:00Z"}
