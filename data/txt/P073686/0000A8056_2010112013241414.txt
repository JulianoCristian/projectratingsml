                         1.       The overall implementation progress of the project after the MTR in November 2009 has been very significant. Given the good progress realized after the MTR, the
                         achievement of the PDO by project closing is considered very likely. The project has disbursed 74% of the grant. This comprises of Goods (76%), Consultancy Services (85%),
                         Training Workshop (68%), Sub-projects (64%), and Operating Cost (64%). This disbursement level will significantly increase as the project disburses the final tranche for the sub-

                         2.       The project has completed the following studies: (i) impact of reservoir management on water flow regime in Fadama areas; (ii) management plan for Oguta Lake and (iii)
                         study to provide basis for the sustainable management of Gebo forest. Further, the disbursement of funds for the second batch of Local development Plans (LDPs) is on course. Out
                         of the 958 sub-projects (first and second batches), 700 have been completed and are sustainable. The rest are at various levels of execution.

                         3.         Safeguards implementation under the project has been highly satisfactory with strict adherence to the following prepared instruments; Resettlement Policy Framework
                         (RPF), Pest Management Plan (PMP), and Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF). During the LDP preparation and review, all sub-projects are screened using
                         the environmental and social screening developed and contained in the ESMF. On some of the sub-projects, site assessments and visits are usually conducted to evaluate site
                         suitability and likely impacts in relation to the carrying capacity of the receiving environment.

                         4.         The re-allocation of funds was recently done and approved on September 1, 2010. This was a re-allocation of funds from the consultancy and unallocated categories to the
                         training/workshop andincremental cost expenditure categories. After the re-allocation process, there has been increased activities of the State WatershedSub-committees (SWS) in
                         the field, essentially to follow-up and provide add-on activities and advisory services on sub-projects implementation.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The following recommendations were made after the field visits: (i) There should be a common pool in which a percentage amount will be paid by members to the group; (ii)
                         Emphasis should be made on group meeting where participatory decisions will be made; (iii) Enforcement of compliance mechanism for the decisions taken by the FUGs and
                         Communal Groups; (iv) The Individual subprojects being practiced could be a solution to the management of the subprojects; (v) There should be proper record keeping across the
                         board to enhance tracking of the projects progress; (vi) There should be regular supervision and monitoring of the subprojects; (vii) There is need for more training on record keeping;
                         (viii) low level of advocacy in the states were observed, in particular in the area of involving Government officials in project supervision missions; in addition, the various sign posts
                         were observed to be very small and the project team was advised to make them big and include their geographic coordinates; (ix) it was suggested that local environmental
                         committee be established at the community levels to supervise the projects; and (x) There is need to ensure that the approved Environmental Management Plan for the project is
                         followed, since the sub projects are to be environmentally inclined for example, it was observed that no provisions were made for the disposal of grass cutter wastes.
