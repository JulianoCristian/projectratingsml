follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the\n            risk to global environment outcome was low or negligible,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: the project design envisaged regular supervision\n            of subprojects by state staff, but the lack of sufficient\n            logistical support somewhat constrained smooth supervision\n            of subprojects in most states. Future operations of this\n            nature should include the procurement of logistics to\n            support supervision. Natural resource management\n            interventions have no benefits and impacts if they are not\n            linked to income-generating activities that improve the\n            living standards of the beneficiaries. The CEMP empowered\n            communities to take the development of their own environment\n            into their own hands by planting and cultivating economic\n            (cash) crops. Through this approach, the communities\n            attached greater importance to the development and\n            sustainability of their own environments."}, "docdt": "2012-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
