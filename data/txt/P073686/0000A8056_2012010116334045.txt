                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The overall implementation of the project has been satisfactory. To date, the project has disbursed 99.9% of the grant amount. The environmental safeguards audit of the sub-
                         projects has been completed. Verification of the utilization of the second tranche of disbursements for sub-projects implementation reveals that the funds were utilized appropriately,
                         and all the sub-project activities have been completed in the six participating states. Printing and dissemination of reports of studies conducted is on-going and expected to be
                         completed before the project closure on December 31, 2011.

                         The project exceeded the benchmarks of the three PDOs/GEOs indicators as explained below:

                         PDO 1: By project end, sustainable watershed management coordination capacity established in at least 60% of participating states;
Public Disclosure Copy




                         At baseline in 2006, the project recorded ineffective coordination, duplication of efforts etc. amongst the various state agencies with mandates on land and water management.
                         As at November, 2011, all the six participating states have established sustainable watershed management coordination capacity as against the targeted 60%. Hence, 100% has
                         been achieved in this regard.

                         PDO 2: By project end, sustainable land and water management practices are mainstreamed in local development plans, in at least 35% of the FCAs;

                         At baseline in 2006, Sustainable Land and Water Management (SLWM) not a priority in the Local Development Plans (LDPs); with only 2% of the Fadama II LDPs in the intervention
                         sites containing SLM practices and, these were mostly on Advisory services. As at November, 2011, all the 48 LDPs by the 38 FCAs in the six participating states contained a total of
                         958 SLM sub-projects. This achievement represents 100% when compared with the targeted 35%. This clearly shows that the project has exceeded the 35 percent cut off point that
                         sustainable land and water management practices must have been mainstreamed into LDP of participating states

                         PDO 3: By project end, area under sustainable land and water management practices at the three pilot sites have increased by 80%;

                         At baseline in 2006, the pilot watersheds (Oguta Lake, Andiwa Lake and Eriti forest reserve) were found not to be sustainably managed, especially due to lack of awareness; and
                         challenges of loss of livelihood and capacity building to sustainably manage the watershed. The baseline findings showed an estimated area under SLM to be 7,421.4ha in the three
                         selected pilot sites (Andiwa Lake, Oguta Lake and Eriti watersheds) i.e about 10% of the total land area of the intervention sites.
                         As at November, 2011, the project has been able to add about 11,709.23Ha comprising of (i.) direct tree planting (651.58ha), (ii.) protected community forest (1,421.05ha) and (iii.)
                         farm size of project beneficiaries that are under SLM practices as a result of CEMP awareness and capacity building (9,636.60ha). These achievements in the three pilot sites of
                         Bauchi, Imo and Ogun states stood at about 87.65% as compared with the target of 80%. However, when the combined areas in the six participating states are considered, the
                         project achieved about 136% of the target for the six states.

                         The borrower's ICR has been completed and validated by the stakeholders. Plans are in place for the preparation of the Bank Implementation Completion Report (ICR), which is also
                         expected to be submitted by the first week of May 2012.
