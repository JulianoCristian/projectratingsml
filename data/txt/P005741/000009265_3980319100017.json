Reform Support Project are to: i) promote access to higher\n            education; ii) improve internal and external efficiency as\n            well as the coherence of the public higher education sector;\n            and iii) enhance the financial sustainability of public\n            higher education institutions.  The project consists of five\n            components.  First, the supply response component will\n            support the expansion and maintenance of facilities and\n            equipment in the public sector, and support the\n            encouragement of the private sector to enter the market of\n            both academic service and ancillary service provision.\n            Second, the quality and relevance component will support\n            adaptation of curricula and pedagogic methods and the\n            enhancement of faculty qualifications and motivation.\n            Third, the governance and management component will train\n            and empower the managers of the new universities with a view\n            to enabling them to make appropriate and timely decisions\n            regarding material, financial, and human resource use.\n            Fourth, intensified use of new technologies will introduce\n            the use of new technologies in teaching and learning, and\n            encourage use of computers and informatics by students and\n            faculty.  Fifth, financing will support elaboration and\n            implementation of a comprehensive financing strategy, and\n            increased the equitable cost-recovery for tuition services\n            and non-academic services by users."}, "docdt": "1998-02-20T00:00:00Z"}
