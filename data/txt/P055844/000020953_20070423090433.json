         Panama Public Policy Reform Technical Assistance Project.\n            The proposed additional loan would finance the cost of\n            activities to amplify the impact and development\n            effectiveness of this well-performing project. The\n            additional activities would contribute to efforts to\n            consolidate and deepen critical reforms needed to accelerate\n            growth and reduce poverty in Panama. These new activities\n            would be fully consistent with the Development Objectives of\n            the ongoing Public Policy Reform Technical Assistance\n            Project. There are 4 components to the project. Project\n            Component A, Fiscal Sustainability and Public Sector\n            Efficiency, is to support pillar II of the Government's\n            strategic plan: to promote economic growth and employment.\n            Project Component B, Social Spending and Poverty Reduction,\n            will provide tools to monitor and evaluate poverty in Panama\n            and specific related interventions. Project Component C,\n            Public Procurement System, will deepen efforts already\n            undertaken in this area by the Government. Project Component\n            D, Project Management, will finance the provision of\n            technical assistance, equipment, training, and operating\n            costs (as necessary) to establish, operate, and strengthen\n            the Project coordination and Project executing units."}, "docdt": "2007-04-16T00:00:00Z"}
