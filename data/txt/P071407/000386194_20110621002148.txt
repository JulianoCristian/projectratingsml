I.   General

1.       Project information: Zambia: The SEED Project’s overall objective is to help reduce the vulnerability of
the Zambian economy to shocks by supporting the diversification of its sources of growth. This is to be achieved by
improving sector specific policy and regulatory frameworks and strengthening the capacity of Government agencies
to implement them. The development objective will also be supported through selective public investments that
stimulate private investments and by creating the conditions for increasing the contribution of gemstones and
tourism sectors to GDP and export revenues. In addition , the Project seeks to improve management of Kafue and
Mosi-o-Tunya National Parks to underpin the long-term sustainable development of the tourism sector.. The SEED
Project has the following four components: Component (1) The tourism component is divided into two main areas,
tourism and protected area management. Within the tourism component, there are three subcomponents: (a) policy,
regulatory and institutional support for Ministry of Tourism, Environment and Natural Resources (MTENR) and its
agencies; (b) tourism investments and capacity building in the Livingstone area; (c) infrastructure for Livingstone
and institutional support for Livingstone City Council. Component 2) has been dropped under the Refocused
Project. Component 3) The Gemstones will support measures aiming to promote gemstones production and trade,
and facilitate its inclusion into the formal economy, improve the sector’s socio-economic contribution at the regional
and national levels, and encourage private sector investments. Component 4) Beneficiary institutions will play an
active role in project implementation.
