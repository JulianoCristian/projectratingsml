                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The Project's overall objective is to help reduce the vulnerability of the Zambian economy to shocks by supporting the diversification of its sources of growth.
                         This is to be achieved by improving sector specific policy and regulatory frameworks and strengtheining the capacity of Government agencies to implement
                         them. The development objective will be supported through selective public investments that stimulate private investments and by creating the condition for
                         increasing the contribution of gemstones, agribusiness and tourism sectors to GDP and export revenues. In addition the project seeks to improve management
                         of Kafue and Mosi-o-Tunya National Parks to underpin the long term sustainable development of the tourism sector.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The performance of the SEED Project has improved after it was restructured in 2008. Now, with 10 months to project closure, the focus is on streamlining business licensing for the
                         tourism and mining industries (as part of GRZ's broader business licensing reform effort) and improving the tourism infrastructure and brokering of tourism concessions in Kafue
                         National Park. To date the Project has supported the development of the tourism and gemstone industries through both hard and soft infrastructure. SEED has completed the
                         rehabilitation of selected tourism infrastructure in Livingstone (roads, street lights, historical buildings, public park) and in Kafue National Park (road maintenance equipment and staff
                         houses). In addition, SEED has supported activities that encourage an enabling business environment in these two industries, such as the provision of international best practice and
                         for critical legislation and other measures to streamline licensing (e.g. support for the mining cadastre and the One Stop Shop in Livingstone. The project has provided some
                         resources for artisanal miners and tourism operators, including infrastructure and capacity building.
