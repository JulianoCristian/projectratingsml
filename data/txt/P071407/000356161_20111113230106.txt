1.      The SEED Project is a $32.2 million project with original contribution from IDA of SDR
19.2 million ($ 28.2 million equivalent), with Global Environment Facility (GEF) providing an
additional $ 4 million equivalent. The Project became effective on November 10, 2004. In
2006/2007, the Project underwent restructuring which resulted in changes of the PDO, project
design, time frame as well as allocation of funds across project activities. The restructured SEED
Project was approved in August 2007.

2.      The implementation of the Project improved after restructuring. Implementation is rated
Moderately Satisfactory mainly because of difficulties in completing infrastructures in the Kafue
National park. Progress toward the Project Development Objective is Moderately Unsatisfactory
as some of the outcome indicators which require the passing of legislation have not been met. To
date cumulative IDA disbursements towards Project implementation amount to $ 17.0 million
with $ 2.2 million undisbursed from the credit (88% overall disbursement). It is expected that the
Project will, following this reallocation, reach 96% disbursement by the November 30, 2011
closing date.

3.      The SEED Project’s objective is to improve the business environment for sustainable
tourism in the Greater Livingstone area and for the gemstone sector. The Global Development
Objective is to reverse biodiversity erosion in Kafue National Park & Mosi-oa-Tunya National
Park. The Project has 3 components/ subcomponents: Ia) Improve the business environment for
tourism in the Greater Livingstone area and at National Level, Ib) Secure critical habitats &
wildlife species in two national parks, and II) Improve business environment for the Gemstone
Sector.

3.     The focus of implementation for the final months are the completion of the
construction of the One-Stop-Shop in Livingstone, the finalization of wildlife viewing
loops and of three airstrips to serve tourism in the Kafue National Park, as well as
supporting the Cadastre Unit in the gemstone sector.

4.     The proposed reallocation is necessary to allow for adequate distribution of funds
to complete most project activities prior to closing date on November 31, 2011. The
funds reallocated originate from a failed road contract in Kafue National Park which has
been cancelled in July 2011. Funds were reallocated to small contractors tasked to
complete a significant portion of the planned civil work in the park and to purchase road
maintenance equipment which will increase the sustainability of the infrastructure
network in the park. The procurement of the remaining civil works contracts is
completed and work has started. The procurement of road maintenance equipment is also
completed; delivery is expected before the closing date on November 30, 2011.

5.      The amounts reallocated have been carefully calculated with the Government and
ZAWA teams to account for undisbursed amounts, for the detailed budget for the year
2011 and for the value of all signed contracts. A total of SDR 435,000 is being proposed
for reallocation. It is originating from the category Civil Works in the protected area
component SDR 435,000. It is distributed as follows: (i) Goods in the tourism
component SDR 5,000, (iii) Goods in the protected area component SDR430,000.
