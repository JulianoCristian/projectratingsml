7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The Project's overall objective is to help reduce the vulnerability of the Zambian economy to shocks by
supporting the diversification of its sources of growth. This is to be achieved by improving sector specific
policy and regulatory frameworks and strengtheining the capacity of Government agencies to implement
them. The development objective will be supported through selective public investments that stimulate
private investments and by creating the condition for increasing the contribution of gemstones,
agribusiness and tourism sectors to GDP and export revenues. In addition the project seeks to improve
management of Kafue and Mosi-o-Tunya National Parks to underpin the long term sustainable
development of the tourism sector.
