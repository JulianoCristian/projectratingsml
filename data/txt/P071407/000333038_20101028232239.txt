1.       The SEED Project is a $32.2 million project with original contribution from IDA of SDR
19.2 million ($ 28.2 million equivalent), with Global Environment Facility (GEF) providing an
additional $ 4 million equivalent. The Project became effective on November 10, 2004. In
2006/2007, the Project underwent restructuring which resulted in changes of the PDO, project
design, time frame as well as allocation of funds across project activities. The restructured SEED
Project was approved in August 2007. The implementation of this Project is moderately
satisfactory but the project is on track to reach its development objectives by closing date in 2011.
To date cumulative IDA disbursements towards Project implementation amount to $ 23.2 million
with $ 6.0 million still undisbursed from the credit (79% overall disbursement). It is expected that
the Project will, following this reallocation fully disburse prior to closing date.

2.      The SEED Project's objective is to improve the business environment for sustainable
tourism in the Greater Livingstone area and for the gemstone sector. The Global Development
Objective is to reverse biodiversity erosion in Kafue National Park & Mosi-oa-Tunya National
Park. The Project has 3 components/ subcomponents: Ia) Improve the business environment for
tourism in the Greater Livingstone area and at National Level, Ib) Secure critical habitats &
wildlife species in two national parks, and II) Improve business environment for the Gemstone
Sector.

3.      The SEED Project shows solid improvement in the implementation since
restructuring. The focus of implementation for the final 18 months will be the
operationalization of the One-Stop-Shop in Livingstone as part of the broader Business
Licensing Reform in Zambia; the finalization of tourism infrastructure in Kafue National
Park, as well as supporting the Cadastre Unit in the gemstone sector. The Project's
disbursement rate is below target due to slow procurement of large construction of houses
and road rehabilitation contracts in the Kafue National Park. However, two out of three
key contracts are signed and the last remaining contracts will be signed in end 2010. To
date the Project has funded rehabilitation of major tourism infrastructure (roads, street
lights, historical buildings) in Livingstone, road maintenance equipment and staff houses
for Kafue National Park, various studies on improving operations in the tourism and
gemstones sector as well as park management in Kafue National Park, introduction of a
mining cadastre etc.

4.      The proposed reallocation is necessary to allow for adequate distribution of funds
to complete all project activities prior to closing date on November 31, 2011. The
amounts reallocated do not exactly match those in the April 19, 2010 letter; they have
been carefully recalculated with the Government team to account for undisbursed
amounts and for the detailed budget for the year 2010 and 2011. A total of SDR
2,317,000 is being proposed for reallocation. It is originating from the following
categories: (i) Unallocated SDR680,000, (ii) Civil work in the protected area component
SDR865,000, (iii) Services in the tourism component SDR623,000 and SDR84,000, (iv)
Operating cost in the protected area component SDR31,000 and (v) the balance after
repayment of the preparation advance SDR34,000. It is distributed as follows: (i) Civil
works in the tourism component SDR533,000 and SDR162,000, (ii) Goods in the tourism
component SDR34,000 and SDR15,000, (iiii) Goods in the protected area component
SDR499,000, (iv) services in the protected are component SDR484,000 and (v)
Operating costs in the tourism component SDR534,000 and SDR56,000. The proposed
reallocation reflects some changes in the operating environment as well as within the
project. Specifically, the increase in operating costs reflects changes in the exchange

                                                 4
rate, which has varied from 3,000 to 5,000. In addition, the refunding of the PPF is less
than 100% ($876k instead of $910k) because some of the PPF was unused.
