This is to be achieved by improving sector specific\n            policy and regulatory frameworks and strengthening the\n            capacity of Government agencies to implement them. The\n            development objective will also be supported through\n            selective public investments that stimulate private\n            investments. The SEED project is a $32.2 million project\n            with original contribution from International Development\n            Association (IDA) of 19.2 million ($ 28.2 million\n            equivalent), with Global Environment Facility (GEF)\n            providing an additional $ 4 million equivalent. The project\n            became effective on November 10, 2004. The reallocation is\n            necessary to allow for adequate distribution of funds to\n            complete all project activities prior to closing date on\n            November 31, 2011. The amounts reallocated do not exactly\n            match those in the April 19, 2010 letter; they have been\n            carefully recalculated with the Government team to account\n            for undisbursed amounts and for the detailed budget for the\n            year 2010 and 2011"}, "docdt": "2010-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
