Expansion and Diversification Project for Zambia were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory; GEO outcome\n            were also moderately satisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was substantial; risk to GEO outcome was also\n            substantial; Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory\n            and borrower performance was also moderately unsatisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned includes: the complexity and diversity\n            of the project required a substantially increased\n            supervision bank budget due to the need to recruit\n            additional sectoral specialists and consultants. The\n            project's strategic choice was to build capacity of\n            Zambia Wildlife Authority (ZAWA) mainly at park and regional\n            management level and not to provide support for policy,\n            legal or institutional reforms at ZAWA Head Quarter (HQ)\n            level. A Project Development Objective (PDO) dependent on\n            the streamlining of licenses that required legislative\n            reforms to achieve outcome indicators without any proper\n            risk mitigation measures was risky and reflecting poor\n            project design. Legislative reforms in most cases are\n            outside the control of a project, especially where they\n            result in loss of discretionary power for the agency\n            responsible under the law. The project should have used the\n            restructuring process to refine the PDO, change outcome\n            indicators and put into place more effective measures to\n            mitigate risk."}, "docdt": "2012-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
