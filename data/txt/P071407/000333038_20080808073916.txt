management. Tourism Sub Component has three focus areas: (a) policy, regulatory and 
institutional support for Ministry of Tourism, Environment and Natural Resources (MTENR) and 
its agencies; (b) tourism investments and capacity building in the Livingstone area; (c) 
infrastructure for Livingstone and institutional support for Livingstone City Council. Component 
3) Gemstones: This component supports measures aimed at promoting gemstones production and 
trade, and facilitate its inclusion into the formal economy as well as improve the sector's socio-
economic contribution at the regional and national levels  
4) Institutional Support: This component supports the capacity of the institutions involved in the 
implementation of the project.
