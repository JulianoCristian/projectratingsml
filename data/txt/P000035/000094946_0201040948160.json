The project reached a large\n            portion of the entire population of Lobito-Benguela, despite\n            the unanticipated large population increases due to the war,\n            and the institutional strengthening and policy changes had a\n            positive impact on the local service delivery and on the\n            national water supply and sanitation sector. This report has\n            identified some key lessons for the future design and\n            implementation of projects: a) In terms of project design,\n            before any financing is provided to a utility for physical\n            investments, the institutional capacity should be evaluated\n            to determine its ability to manage and operate the proposed\n            investments. b) In terms of project implementation,\n            decentralized projects require an adequate mechanism for\n            communication among the implementing agencies, the Central\n            Government, and IDA. c) Local staff should assume\n            responsibility for the implementation of the project when\n            technical assistance is provided to a project management or\n            coordination unit, and transfer of knowledge to the local\n            staff should take precedence over speed of execution."}, "docdt": "2001-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
