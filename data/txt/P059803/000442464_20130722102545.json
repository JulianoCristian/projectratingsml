Some lessons\n            learned included: beneficiary assessment should be\n            programmed in some form or manner in an environment clean-up\n            project. It can be a valuable tool in understanding the\n            social gains made under the project. In pollution clean-up\n            projects, adaptation to local conditions and inherent\n            uncertainties regarding the extent of pollution is largely a\n            process of learning by doing. When contamination occurs, the\n            involved physicochemical processes tends to be governed by\n            complex, multi-factorial conditions that can lead to\n            extremely irregular pollution distributions and create a\n            high probability for unforeseen situations that are\n            uncovered only during remediation works. The project design\n            should factor in the risks associated with recurrent\n            institutional changes and state approval processes in\n            Kazakhstan leading to delays. Upfront agreement with\n            counterparts about operation and maintenance for the post\n            closure landfill should be planned. Project level monitoring\n            and evaluation (M and E) should be given due attention\n            during project preparation and implementation."}, "docdt": "2013-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
