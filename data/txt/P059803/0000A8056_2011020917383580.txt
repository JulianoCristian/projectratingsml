                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the project is to improve the welfare of the population in the Nura River Basin by cleaning up serious mercury pollution in area
                         adjacent to the Nura River, providing a safe, secure and cost effective alternative source of water supply to meet growing needs of local water users, and
                         restoring flow control in the river for flood management and ecological purposes.

                         accordance with international standards and with special attention for robustness and limited need for maintenance and monitoring after closure of the cells. To date, more than
                         1,000,000 tons of contaminated soil and ash have been safely disposed from the Karbide Factory, the sedimentation ponds, the Zhaur swamp, river banks and floodplains, based on

                         pollution sampling and mapping of polluted areas. A total of approximately 140,000 samples have been taken and analyzed for mercury content to determine the level of pollution
                         and necessary clean-up measures. In line with international standards, a clean-up criterion for mercury of 10 mg/kg was adopted for the river bed sediments, river banks and the
                         Zhaur swamp. For the flood plains, excavation is done when the thickness of pollution is more than 20 cm. For house gardens where vegetables and fruits are grown, the clean-up
                         criterion of 2.1 mg/kg is applied.

                         Dismantling of the Karbide Factory was completed in the winter period 2007-2008. In the period November 2008 till May 2009, all wastes, sub ground structures and contaminated
                         soils up to a depth of 2 meters were transported to the landfill and the area has now been backfilled with clean clay. The sedimentation ponds of the wastewater treatment plant have
                         been fully remediated. Remaining works are the clean-up of river sediments and further excavation and containment of river banks and floodplains. Approximately half of the works at
                         the Intumak Dam have been completed and the seepage under the dam crest has stopped as a result.
