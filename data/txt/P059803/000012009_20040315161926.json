There are\n            four project components. The first includes financing to 1)\n            construct a secure landfill for proper containment of\n            contaminated soil and materials; 2) excavate contaminated\n            hotspots at the AO Karbide plant site at Temirtau (factory\n            building, main drain, and adjacent waste disposal sites);\n            and 3) excavate other highly contaminated areas including\n            the Zhaur Swamp, and critical areas of mercury accumulation\n            along the banks and floodplains of the Nura River, as well\n            as the transport of the materials to the landfill site.\n            Component 2 finances rehabilitation of the Intumak\n            Reservoir, including reinforcement of the dam and completion\n            of the spillway and gates to allow the dam to operate as a\n            mechanism for flow control at its original design reservoir\n            level. Component 3 finances technical assistance, training,\n            and equipment needed to increase the institutional capacity\n            of the Nura-Sarysu River Basin Authority, in order to\n            strengthen its resource planning and management capacity, as\n            well as to strengthen the water quality monitoring network,\n            and water pollution control systems. Component 4 covers a\n            number of activities related to project management and\n            monitoring, including providing training in areas such as\n            procurement, disbursement, and project accounting; auditing\n            project accounts; assisting in implementing the\n            environmental management plan, especially in regard to\n            public awareness; and specialist assistance in areas such as\n            hydrology, social sciences, and environmental management."}, "docdt": "2003-03-27T00:00:00Z"}
