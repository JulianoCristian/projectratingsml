                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is making progress towards its development objectives. Over 16,000 connections have been made, more than 80% of the target. Nearly 50% of the annual avoided
                         carbon target has been achieved, and the full target will be realized provided that sub-projects now in the pipeline are realized. The Department of Energy (DOE) component is
                         coming to a close. Significant contracts relating to renovation of public solar home system installations and two technical assistance activities are ramping up, and all three activities
                         will need to be completed by end-2011 as the grant will close on December 31. The Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) component will run until Dec. 31, 2012, but currently

                         realistic chance to disburse before the close of the project.
