                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The objective of the project is to assist in the implementation of the first phase of the Rural Power Development Program aimed at supporting reforms and priority
                         investments to achieve the aforementioned objectives of the sector. Specifically, under APL1, the project would (a) test and demonstrate viable business models that
                         maximize leveraging of public resources with private investment for decentralized electrification; (b) support transformation of ECs through institutional and operational
                         improvements; and (c) avoid C02 emission through wider use of renewable energy.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                            Yes           No

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has made progress towards its development objectives. Over 16,000 connections have been made, more than 80% of the target. Nearly 50% of the annual avoided
                         carbon target has been achieved, and the full target will be realized provided that sub-projects now in the pipeline are realized. The Department of Energy (DOE) GEF-financed
                         component has closed, as has the GEF (Global Environment Facility) grant to DBP Development Bank of the Philippines). However, continued progress toward meeting the
                         development objective is experiencing difficulties because the component managed by DBP has stalled; no new loans have been made with this line of credit, because DBP loan
                         pricing has become structurally uncompetitive in a market that has witnessed very significant changes since late 2009. With half of the $40-million additional financing uncommitted,
                         it will be critical to re-focus marketing efforts on the electric cooperative sector, within the framework of a co-financing agreement recently concluded with the National Electrification
                         Administration (NEA). The project close at the end of December 2012 so this will be a significant challenge.
