for the Rural Power Project for\n            Philippines were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            unsatisfactory; Global Environment Objective (GEO) outcomes\n            were moderately unsatisfactory; risk to development outcome\n            was moderate; risk to GEO outcome was moderate; bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory; and borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: line of credit operations, being\n            demand-driven is essential, and this needs to be balanced\n            with due diligence, demand-building, marketing, and upfront\n            technical support; flexibility is crucial for credit lines\n            and other facilities targeting rural electrification and\n            renewable energy; effective coordination of different\n            government and donor initiatives targeting the same issue is\n            imperative; while designing off-grid electrification\n            business models, it is advisable to think long and hard\n            about sustainability up front, and remember that there are\n            different ways of ensuring sustainability; solar\n            Photovoltaic (PV) should be part of a balanced portfolio of\n            decentralized electrification solutions."}, "docdt": "2013-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
