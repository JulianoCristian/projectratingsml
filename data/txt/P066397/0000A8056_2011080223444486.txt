                         APL1: (i) test and demonstrate viable business models that maximize leveraging of public resources with private investment for decentralized electrification; (ii)
                         support transformation of ECs through institutional and operational improvements; and (iii) avoid CO2 emission through wider use of renewable energy.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has met many of its objectives; it has helped to bolster electric cooperatives, and has attracted some private sector involvement in the solar home systems sector. Over
                         14,000 solar home systems have been installed, and progress has been made on the avoidance of future carbon emissions. However, a slowdown in lending by the Development
                         Bank of the Philippines could become a problem unless lending volumes pick up. The problem faced by DBP is that the rates offered to borrowers reflect the combination of the cost

                         credit market alternatives, so the money is not moving. A solution to this issue is being worked on.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The World Bank, Department of Energy, Development Bank of the Philippines, and the Department of Finance will consult on the issues related to on-lending mechanisms to see
                         whether or not a workable solution to the current interest rate problem can be found, consistent with the Bank's guidelines under which Bank-supported lines of credit must not distort
                         credit markets.
