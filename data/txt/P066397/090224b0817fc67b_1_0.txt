                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The objective of the project is to assist in the implementation of the first phase of the Rural Power Development Program aimed at supporting reforms and priority
                         investments to achieve the aforementioned objectives of the sector. Specifically, under APL1, the project would (a) test and demonstrate viable business models that
                         maximize leveraging of public resources with private investment fordecentralized electrification; (b) support transformation of ECs through institutional and operational
                         improvements; and (c) avoid C02 emission through wider use of renewable energy.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                            Yes           No

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has achieved some of its development objectives. Over 21,000 rural electricity connections, mostly solar home systems, have been made, exceeding the target of
                         20,000. But achievement of the carbon avoidance targets will undershoot, because the credit line supported by the project has been unable to meeting its lending targets. As a
                         consequence, about half of the $40-million of the Additional Financing will not be committed, and instead will be canceled upon closure of the project at the end of December, 2012.
                         Estimated annual carbon avoided amounts now to over 10,000 tons of CO2, which will more than double when a small hydro under construction is completed, but only a little more
                         than half the avoided annual carbon target of 40,000 tons of CO2 will have been achieved. The credit line, managed by DBP, has been negatively affected by both supply and
                         demand factors in the credit markets. While the Additional Financing was agreed at a time of global financial tightness, in 2009, since then the Philippines market has been
                         characterized by high liquidity, lengthening tenors, declining interest rates, and increased risk tolerance among the commercial banks. But the demand for credit from renewable
                         energy projects has been less than anticipated, primarily because the feed-in tariff mechanism is still not operational, four years after passage of the Renewable Energy Act 2008.
                         Electric cooperatives continue to be enthusiastic borrowers for investments in supply-side energy efficiency, but commercial lenders that can be accessed through the electric
                         cooperative partial credit guarantee (EC PCG) program have become more attractive sources of debt than the Development Bank of the Philippines, which manages the RPP-
                         financed credit line. Changes in the credit market have been, overall, very good news for the economy generally and for the energy sector specifically, but those positive changes
                         have effectively eliminated the rationale for public financing of lines of credit for energy sector investments.
