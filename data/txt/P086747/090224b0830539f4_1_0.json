Affected Areas Project for Sri Lanka were as\n            follows: outcomes was satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: Flexibility in operations management and\n            project structure is critical where the exogenous setting is\n            uncertain. The speedy response to changing circumstances\n            and, in particular, the catastrophic flooding which affected\n            Sri Lanka in 2010, caused some problems. The inclusion of a\n            major infrastructure element within what was essentially a\n            community development project required considerable\n            modifications to project activities. Community-managed\n            livelihood loan programs can be very effective in reducing\n            poverty. The concept of using Community Resource Persons\n            (CRP) was proven to be both beneficial and sustainable. The\n            lack of agreements and proper arrangements with respect to\n            the implementation entity and responsibilities was a\n            significant cause of initial uncertainty and delay in early\n            implementation. It is important to carefully assess and\n            field test new technologies (i.e. in this case, the polynet\n            greenhouses) before their wide spread promotion. Carefully\n            thought out exit strategy to ensure sustainability of\n            community activities."}, "docdt": "2015-06-30T23:51:04Z"}
