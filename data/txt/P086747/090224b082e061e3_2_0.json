popularly known as Reawakening\n            Project (RaP) - in two districts of Sri Lanka. The project\n            focuses on identifying the pathways to promote nutrition\n            with multiple stakeholders. This project also aims to\n            explore the pathways and quantifying their relative\n            contributions on food security and nutrition related\n            outcomes. It is believed that rural development programs\n            have an impact on multiple health related behaviors and\n            outcomes. The study focuses primarily on nutritional\n            outcomes, but includes several others. In addition, this\n            project aims to provide evidence on understanding the best\n            ways to operationalize multi-sectoral approaches and\n            innovative multi-sectoral delivery strategies. Generating\n            this new evidence could attract more local and national\n            level policy makers to consider health impacts when they\n            make decisions. The output of this study will solidify the\n            call for inter-sectoral collaborations and whole of\n            government approaches to improve nutrition and health, in\n            particular in developing countries."}, "docdt": "2014-10-01T14:30:05Z"}
