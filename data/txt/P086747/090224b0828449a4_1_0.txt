                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR has been prepared based on the findings during the joint Implementation Review and Support Mission which was carried out during the period of August 18 - September 1,
                         2014. The PDO is likely to be achieved by the current closing date of December 31, 2014. All four project components are proceeding well with actual component outputs being in
                         line with work program targets. As of July 31, 2014, total cumulative disbursement of the original Credit (Cr 3935 CE) is 96%, 100% of the first Additional Financing (Cr 4671 LK), and
                         97% of the Second/Third Additional Financing (Cr 4956 LK). The actual total project expenditure up to July 31, 2014 stands at 93%, 100%, and 93% in Credit 1, 2 and 3 respectively,
                         compared to cumulative financial targets of the agreed annual work plan. The gap between disbursements and expenditure is mainly due to the advance released to the project.
                         Previously agreed actions to strengthen implementation have been mostly completed. The project is implemented in accordance with the legal covenants and environmental and
                         social safeguards provisions. There are no major issues reported related to procurement administration and financial management.
