                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR has been prepared based on the findings of the Technical Mission which was carried out during the period of October 18 - November 8, 2013. All four project components
                         have been rated Satisfactory. The outputs of these four components are in line with the work program targets and the outcomes have collectively contributed to the achievement of
                         the PDO. The total cumulative disbursement as of November 22, 2013 is 91% in original Credit, 100% in first Additional Financing, and 82% in Second/Third Additional Financing.
                         The status of fulfilling the agreed actions during the previous mission is Satisfactory. The procurement administration, financial management, legal covenants and social/
                         environmental safeguards are rated Satisfactory. In view of the above significant achievements, the project implementation progress continues to be Satisfactory.

                         About 66 cluster businesses have begun operations and about 70 are in the pipe line. The agriculture clusters have already begun operation and have started making profits and the
                         non-farm ones have also received good orders (especially paper designs). Climate Smart Agriculture practices have been initiated with promising results. The business unit is
                         providing significant front end support to the nascent organizations and facilitating strong relations with the private sector and exploring business linkages with key government
                         departments. However, the project needs to focus on 2nd generation issues (value addition/brand development and Private sector partnerships), and take critical action against
                         VDOs and clusters that are not performing well, such as through institutional building and technical assistance to the VDOs and clusters.

                         The project is working on cutting-edge developments such as Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA). CSA Polynet houses are showing early promise. The strategy adopted by the project
                         seeks to increase sustainable productivity, strengthen farmers’ resilience to weather, reduce agriculture’s greenhouse gas emissions, IPM and increase carbon sequestration. It
                         strengthens food security and delivers environmental benefits. In particular, farmers following these methods of agriculture have mentioned that their crops do fetch a better price in
                         the market. They now need to tap export houses and buyers of IPM/Organic produce to receive the premium price realization for their investments and also see if they can receive
                         carbon credits for their efforts.

                         Discussions are being held with the IFC to tap into their business advisory service to build sustainability of the clusters and also of the Business Unit of the project. IFC has already
                         conducted a scoping visit and WB team is now working with IFC to prepare a joint Concept Note for the partnership. IFC will look at mechanisms to strengthen institution building and
                         governance structures, financial reporting, trade facilitation, market linkages, technology, access to finance etc. At a later stage, IFC will also work with the business units of the
                         project (BU) to explore option of converting the BU into a business facilitation center that can continue to provide key support to the clusters beyond the project life.

                         The Project team is already working with several Commercial Banks and facilitating loans to the VDOs. So far, 03 VDOs have received loans of around US$ 20,000 each and more
                         are in the pipe line. In many cases, the VDOs have facilitated loans to individuals from commercial banks especially agriculture loans and micro enterprises loans to start their small
                         business. So far, US $ 2 million has been mobilized by the VDOs from the commercial banks.

                         Many Sri Lankan business houses, and leading conglomerates, such as John Keells, Cargills, Haleys, CIC, Nestle, Sanken etc have designed major investment strategies for

                         expanding their businesses to the North and the East. They are particularly focusing on key sectors such as dairy, agriculture, retail, civil construction and infrastructure. The Project
                         has already executed a partnership with John Keells, CIC for Maize and Alley for Agri products (maize, black gram, onions etc). The team is now working towards partnership with
                         other major conglomerated mentioned above. It is necessary to develop key linkages with the hotel industries (especially CSA and IPM products) to supply their agri products and
                         also explore possibilities of a table space in the hotels during the upcoming Christmas season to sell their COGO brand products (farm and handicrafts).

                         The project has put youth employment on a high priority and is working systematically towards these goals. So far, 2,220 youth have been linked to jobs. Livelihood Development
                         Officers (LDOs) are also facilitating overseas employment opportunities, in addition to facilitating linkages with mainstream companies, hospitals for nursing attendants and ICT. The
                         project is also working with Vocational Training Institute in several districts for youth employment with guaranteed employment for the youth that have undergone training
                         successfully. These efforts need to be scaled up significantly.

                         Family Economic Enhancement Package (FEEP) is a special investment package for the women headed households in all the districts. This is an innovative mechanism to address
                         livelihoods for the most vulnerable-WHH. The model of devising different income streams and spreading risks (different crops, dairy etc.) has been much appreciated by the target

                         communities as this will enable to earn throughout the year. The interventions are substantially contributing to building secured self-esteem. So far, 1,363 beneficiaries received
                         benefits of allocation from 1st tranche. They are now waiting for benefits due as a result from the 2nd tranche. The project is urged to initiate disbursement of the benefits form the
                         2nd tranche at the earliest. Furthermore, the project is strongly recommended to scale up these efforts and also well document these interventions and showcase to the world.
                         Ministry of Economic Development is now working with the Ministry of Finance & Planning to approach the Bank for TF assistance.

                         Through interactions with cluster representatives, it was noted that the cluster members are still looking towards the project to provide them guidance on institutional building and
                         business planning. Some of them are doing very well, but a few are quite weak. Some require fine tuning. A diagnostic need has to be undertaken to identify the key problem areas
                         and corrective action is taken to resolve pending issues. The GOSL intends to close the project by June 30, 2014 though the official closing date is December 31, 2014.

                                  Key Project Impacts: The project is making positive contribution to the national economy. It is saving scarce foreign exchange, contributing to public health, contributing to
                         exports and BoP issues, potential realization through Carbon credits and importantly, mindset change and knowledge building through CSA. These need to be captured and
                         tabulated.
