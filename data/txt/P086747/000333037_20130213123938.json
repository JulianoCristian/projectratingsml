The\n            reallocation is necessary to transfer funds from the less\n            performing categories to better performing categories in\n            order to accommodate the ground realities and future\n            challenges as a result of the change in the project\n            environment from conflict scenario to post conflict\n            situation. In order to assist the Department of Agrarian\n            Development in implementing the rehabilitation of village\n            tank program and also to introduce protected agriculture\n            methods, the project had to hire the services of consultants\n            and employ some field staff. This action was necessary to\n            complete the project activities smoothly and on time. As a\n            result, consultancy cost increased from 2.63 percent to 3.57\n            percent and incremental cost increased from 1.84 percent to\n            3.33 percent. The total allocation of these categories\n            amounts to only 6.9 percent of the total fund."}, "docdt": "2013-02-08T00:00:00Z"}
