 these two sectors and how to evaluate the
 impact of different development projects on
 nutrition.

    nutrition outcomes. It includes identifying the
    pathways to promote nutrition with multiple
    stakeholders. It aims to explore the pathways
    in which development programs have a direct
    impact on nutrition and health and to quantify
    their relative contributions on nutrition and food
    security related outcomes.

    In addition, this project aims to provide evidence
    on understanding the best ways to operationalize
    multi-sectoral approaches and innovative multi-                                                 Stakeholder Meeting Moneragala, August 2014
