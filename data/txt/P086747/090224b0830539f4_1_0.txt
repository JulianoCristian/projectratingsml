F. Results Framework Analysis
Original Project Development Objectives
The original development objective (2004) was to help conflict-affected communities in the
NE Province and adjoining areas to restore livelihoods, enhance agricultural and other
production and incomes, and build capacity for sustainable social and economic
reintegration.
Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
 The PDO was revised at the time of the Second/Third Additional Financing in June 2011
to recognize the separation of the NE Province into two provinces (North and East) and to
include reference to the purpose of the additional financing to assist flood-affected
communities. It was revised to read: “Help conflict- and/or flood-affected communities and
villages in the North, East and adjoining areas by restoring their livelihoods, enhancing
agricultural production and income, and building their capacity for sustainable social and
economic reintegration”.

Indicator 3: Number of hectares of irrigation area rehabilitated
Value (no.)             0.0                 32,000        114,000          94,719
Date achieved                           25-May-2004 10-Jun-2011 31-Dec-2014
              85% Achieved. Rehabilitation of one large scheme (Iranamadhu in
              Kilinochchi District) was taken up by the Asian Development Bank and
Comments      funds budgeted for this scheme were then used for expanding the works at
              Giant’s Tank. Additionally, the number of villages were expanded due to
              high demand and irrigation allocation was reduced.

Indicator 4: Proportion of vulnerable people who are VDO members
Value (%)                 0.0                   80               80               59
Date achieved                              25-May-2004 10-Jun-2011 31-Dec-2014
              74% Achieved. It proved difficult to attract most vulnerable people to
              participate in VDO activities, as income generation was essential for this
Comments      group. It is also argued that since all project beneficiaries were affected
              and lost their entire livelihoods, all beneficiaries could be categorized as
              vulnerable. If so, the achievement is 100%.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country and Sector Background: Sri Lanka faced the immense challenge of establishing
political, social and economic stability following almost two decades of armed conflict
from 1983 to 2002 between the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) and Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). A ceasefire had been in effect since February 2002 that appeared
to offer the possibility a transition towards a permanent solution to the conflict. At the time
of appraisal, the GOSL and the LTTE had maintained the ceasefire for the longest period
since the conflict began. It significantly eased tensions, improved the security situation,
galvanized socioeconomic activities, and increased the movement of people, goods and
commodities between the NE and the South. Although the situation remained fragile, there
were hopes of a durable peace. In the interim, the GOSL was successfully engaged with
international donors to mobilize financial support for immediate humanitarian assistance
and the rehabilitation, reconstruction and development needs of the war-torn areas.
The protracted war worsened the poverty situation in the entire country. The livelihoods of
the population of the eight administrative districts of the North-East (NE) province and, to
a lesser extent of the four adjoining districts, were severely affected. In the NE and the
adjoining areas, the conflict resulted in, inter alia, disruption of local economies, damage
to essential village-level infrastructure, breakdown of input and output markets and
technical support services, the weakening or dissolution of community organizations and
institutional networks, the elimination of employment opportunities, and widespread
vulnerability and social and economic insecurity.
The major challenge for the affected and returning population, therefore, was to recover
from social and economic shocks and reintegrate into the socioeconomic mainstream.
However, the conflict had also weakened the ability and capacity of government
institutions and administrative mechanisms in the NE province to plan, implement and
coordinate reconstruction and development initiatives. In this situation, the GOSL and the
LTTE agreed that the resettlement of displaced persons, restoration of social and economic
infrastructure, and capacity building in the NE, were priority tasks in the recovery and
reconciliation process.
The project was initially appraised in 2004 as Phase 2 of the North East Irrigated
Agriculture Project (NEIAP) and became effective in October of that year1. At the time of
appraisal the primary goals of GOSL’s poverty reduction strategy was to achieve peace

    The official name of the project was changed to the Community Livelihoods in Conflict Affected Areas
     Project through an addendum to the development credit agreement dated 4 October 2007.



                                                      1
and a significant transformation in the quality of life of the people, especially in rural areas
through increased incomes, economic modernization and re-invigoration of the rural
economy.
Rationale for Bank Involvement: At the time of project preparation, the GOSL and the
LTTE recognized the Bank as a key development partner in the implementation of Sri
Lanka’s Poverty Reduction Strategy and the rehabilitation, reconstruction and
development of the conflict-affected areas. Since 1999, the Bank played a pioneering role
in assisting resettlement, rehabilitation and reconstruction, by catalyzing international
donor assistance to help restore livelihoods of conflict-affected people. Both the GOSL and
the LTTE recognized that the Bank, through the NEIAP and North East Emergency
Reconstruction Program (NEERP), were able to help socioeconomic recovery of the region
and reach vulnerable groups in remote villages. In addition, the GOSL and the LTTE
requested the Bank to be the administrator of a North East Reconstruction Fund (NERF),
a pool of financial resources from bilateral and international Non-Governmental
Organizations (NGOs) for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the North and East of
Sri Lanka.
Major stakeholders, including LTTE, requested the Bank’s support for this repeater project
because of the Bank’s ability to design and provide guidance to implement community-
based programs that target vulnerable people and reach rural remote villages in conflict-
affected areas. Given the implementation experience and successful outcomes of NEIAP
(which received an ICR rating of satisfactory), the Bank was in a favorable position to scale
up the NEIAP by augmenting, consolidating and sustaining its outputs and impacts, while
extending its scope and geographical spread, to reach more conflict-affected communities.
At the time of preparation, the Bank was engaged in the implementation of an innovative
Community-Driven Development (CDD) pilot under Village Self-Help Learning Initiative
(VSHLI) and the Community Development and Livelihood Improvement “Gemidiriya”
project (CDLIP) in the south of Sri Lanka (outside the conflict-affected area). The latter
was the first phase of an adaptable lending program that supported rural development and
community empowerment. While other major donors were supplementing and
complementing efforts for conflict related poverty reduction as well as rehabilitation and
reconstruction of the war affected region, the Bank’s involvement in the proposed project
was focused more towards facilitating closer interaction between these programs, mutually
sharing knowledge and experience and building synergies.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The original PDO was “to help conflict-affected communities in the NE Province and
adjoining areas to restore livelihoods, enhance agricultural and other production and
incomes, and build capacity for sustainable social and economic reintegration”. The four
outcome indicators included in PAD’s Annex 3: Results Framework and Monitoring at
appraisal were:
      (a) Percent of targeted households (85,000) benefiting from increased income and
          village level social and economic infrastructure;
      (b) Number of employment opportunities generating from increased agricultural
          production potential and other sub projects;
      (c) Number of sustainable village level community organizations capable of village
          level planning, implementation and monitoring development activities; and
      (d) Number of self-reliant farmer organizations, federations or companies engaged in
          productive, sustainable and competitive agriculture production and marketing.

1.3 Revised PDOs and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

The revised PDO was “to help conflict and/or flood affected communities in the Northern
and Eastern Provinces and adjoining areas to restore livelihoods, and enhance agricultural
and other production and incomes, and build their capacity for sustainable social and
economic reintegration”. The Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) underwent change thrice
– in 2007 with First Restructuring, in 2010 with First Additional Financing, and in 2011
with Second/Third Additional Financing. However, itthe change in KPIs was a minor
revision involving only the addition of additional flood damaged communities to the
project target areas. The change was made in the third additional Financing Agreement
dated on November 29, 2011. The table below presents the KPI changes and reasons for
the original and revised KPIs.
                    Table 1: Original KPIs and Reasons for Changes
 No              Original KPI                                Reasons of Changes
  1 Percent of targeted households               The number of target households
    (85,000) benefiting from increased           increased. As a result, percentage became
    income and village level social and          irrelevant. It was also decided to separate
    economic infrastructure.                     livelihood support indicators from village
                                                 social and economic infrastructure. This
                                                 KPI was kept as KPI 1 of the revised
                                                 KPIs.
  2     Number of employment                     Employment opportunities are not only

        (1,000).
3       Number of sustainable village level       There was shift in the project focus from
        community organizations capable of        strengthening pre-existing CBOs to
        village level planning,                   instead forming new VDOs. With the
        implementation and monitoring             change, it was difficult to set a new target
        development activities.                   numbers. In addition, to measure the
                                                  level of CBOs and VDOs in terms of
                                                  defining sustainable organizations with a
                                                  single method became difficult. The
                                                  project carried out grading of VDOs, but
                                                  it was not possible to apply the same
                                                  grading system to Batch-I CBOs.
4       Number of self-reliant farmer             Because of the shift of focus on VDOs
        organizations, federations or             and revolving funds, outcomes of project
        companies engaged in productive,          activities broaden. In addition, new
        sustainable and competitive               economic activities as a result of
        agriculture production and                revolving funds and cluster development
        marketing.                                grew rapidly and it became difficult to
                                                  measure the impacts of individual loans.

         from livelihood opportunities             people who received support from the
         (213,000).                                project in re-establishing their
                                                   livelihoods.
    2    Number of employment                      The focus also shifted to youth and ex-
         opportunities generated (1,000)           combatants who often seek employment
                                                   outside of agriculture sector. This KPI
                                                   was kept as KPI 2 of the revised KPIs.
    3    Number of hectares of irrigation area     Despite the fact that the rehabilitation of
         rehabilitated (114,000)                   irrigation systems was the major project
                                                   activity, it was not included as a part of
                                                   KPIs.

                                                   became very important and the project

                                                   them. However, no KPI existed to
                                                   measure the outcome of associated
                                                   project activities.

        provided by the project (10,000)           especially at the four adjacent districts,
                                                   active in connecting water supply pipes
                                                   to households.


1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The project’s original main beneficiaries were populations in conflict-affected
communities in eight districts of the Northern and Eastern Provinces: (1) Ampara; (2)
Batticaloa; (3) Jaffna; (4) Kilinochchi; (5) Mannar; (6) Mullaitivu; (7) Trincomalee; and
(8) Vavuniya; as well as four districts adjoining these provinces (province in parentheses)
which were judged to have been significantly affected by the conflict; (9) Moneragala
(Uva); (10) Puttalam (North West); (11) Anuradhapura (North Central); and (12)
Polonnaruwa (North Central).
In November 2010, the heaviest rain in 18 years flooded Sri Lanka, causing serious damage
to tanks (reservoirs), irrigation systems, roads and other infrastructure. The GOSL and the
Bank agreed on additional financing to restore damaged infrastructure in four further
districts beyond the original 12 mentioned above: (13) Badulla (Uva); (14) Kandy
(Central); (15) Matale (Central); and (16) Nuwar Eliya (Central) and increasing the number
of beneficiary households. It should be noted, however, that activities in the additional
districts were not undertaken at community level and did not involve the creation of any
further VDOs. The expanded beneficiary numbers therefore refer to the district populations
estimated to have benefitted from the repaired or rehabilitated civil works.

Table 3 below presents the number of investments made by the project and the estimated
number of project beneficiary households. Over ten years of project implementation project
supported more than one million of beneficiaries. It is important to note that the original
design aimed to reach around 85,000 families totaling around 400,000 people.

1.5 Original Components
Component 1: Village rehabilitation and development (US$53.14 million). This
component comprised: (a) reviving, forming and strengthening CBOs; (b) community-
level subprojects for rehabilitation and improvements to essential village-level social and
economic infrastructure and facilities; (c) livelihood support activities for vulnerable
groups and people, and (d) special development activities targeting women, widows, land
mine victims, etc. The main targeted beneficiaries were Internally Displaced People (IDPs)
and other conflict-affected households in 600 selected focal villages in the project area.
Component 2: Essential rehabilitation and improvements to selected major irrigation
schemes (US$16.74 million). This component included essential dam safety repairs and
improvements, and urgent rehabilitation/improvements to major irrigation, drainage, and
conveyance/feeder canals of selected five major irrigation/drainage schemes (Allai Scheme
in Trincomalee District, Ginats Tank in Mannar District, Iranamadu Scheme in Kilinochchi
District, Karavahu Scheme in Ampara District and Rugam Scheme in Batticaloa District).
This component aimed to benefit approximately 15,000 farming families who were
dependent on these schemes for their livelihoods.
Component 3: Farmer Organization (FO) capacity building and empowerment and
strengthening of agricultural support services (US$4.92 million). The objective of this
component was to develop the ability and capacity of FOs and farmer federations (FFs) of
the NE to improve the productivity, sustainability and competitiveness of agriculture. This
component included: (a) forming, supporting and strengthening viable and commercially
oriented FOs and FFs; and (b) strengthening the capacity of government agricultural
research, extension and inputs supply services.




                                            6
Component 4: Capacity building, project implementation support and project oversight
(US$6.34 million). This component provided resources for two principal activities:
(a) Capacity building of provincial, district/divisional, and local government agencies
other than agriculture-related agencies responsible for project implementation; and
(b) Project implementation support and oversight.

1.6 Revised Components
The changes occurred during first restructuring in 2007 with the change in approach to
implementation of Component 1, and during the approval of Second/Third Additional
Financing with the inclusion of the four districts affected by floods to rehabilitate village
infrastructure facilities.
Component 1: Village Institutions, Infrastructure and Livelihoods Development ($63.98
million). The revised component aimed to develop and strengthen local institutional
capacity, and provide support to village level infrastructure and productive livelihood
development.
The major change in focus was to enhance the CDD approach by creating VDOs, instead
of working with existing CBOs; the original approach of the project. Under this component,
the project allocated approximately US$50 per community member for activities in the
form of a village fund that each VDO disbursed through participatory planning processes.
As a result of the Mid Term Review, after 2007 this component comprised:
   •   Capacity Building Fund (10% of village allocation) to build capacity of the VDOs
       to plan and facilitate their community members, including the capacity to manage
       livelihood funds (revolving funds);
   •   Infrastructure Fund (40% of village allocation) to develop priority village
       infrastructure; and
   •   Livelihood Fund (50% of the village allocation) to enhance livelihoods of
       vulnerable and poor households by providing skills training for the youth and
       grants/loans to target households for developing productive livelihoods.

Two major increases in resource allocation occurred for this component during the
implementation period, albeit with no further changes in the nature of component activities.
In December 2009, following the end of the civil war and the accelerated return of IDPs to
their communities, an additional US$12 million was provided under a 1st Additional
Financing to permit the expansion of the number of communities participating in the
project. An additional US$16 million was further allocated to this component under the
2nd/3rd Additional Financing in June 2011, primarily targeted at community level
infrastructure, including irrigation systems, roads and potable water supply systems
damaged by the floods of late 2010.


                                             7
Component 2: Essential rehabilitation and improvement to selected major irrigation
schemes ($57.62 million). The Second/Third Additional Financing in June 2011 increased
the resources available for this component by the amount of US$32 million in response to
the serious flooding that had affected many areas of Sri Lanka during late 2010. This
additional funding permitted the expansion of major irrigation rehabilitation and access
road repair in four additional districts, although no additional village level activities were
proposed.
Component 3: Community Livelihoods and Cluster Development Component ($4.88
million).
This component was revised in 2007 to move away from establishing FOs and improving
agricultural support services to instead promoting and supporting the increased output of
high quality village products (farm and non-farm) by supporting the formation of ‘cluster’
commercial enterprises linked to private and/or public organizations. Another key activity
within this component was support for 607 Family Economic Enhancement Packages
(FEEPs), supporting small enterprises operated by female-headed households. Clusters
were to be formed by members of one or more VDOs in order to establish and operate
some form of small business or agricultural operation and were provided with grant funds.
FEEPs were similar in nature, being offered grant funds to enable economic activities, but
were restricted to female headed households.
Component 4: Project Implementation Support and Oversight (US$14.63 million). As a
result of the additional financings, the expansion of the target districts, and the change of
implementation modality from district government based implementation to the direct
project execution modality through the Project Management Unit (PMU), the extent of this
component was changed significantly. These changes included adding two Provincial
PMUs2.

1.7 Other significant changes
Table 5 below summarizes major changes in project structure or functioning during the
implementation period.




2
    The North East Province was divided into two separate provinces in 2007, requiring one additional PPMU
    in Vavuniya. A second additional PPMU was also created in Batticaloa. Following the agreement for the
    additional financing for FDR, a further PMU was established for the four new Districts in 2011.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Soundness of background analysis: The background analysis was sound as, at the time
when the Bank proposed to fund a second phase of the NEIAP, it had received a detailed
Needs Assessment completed in 2003 for all 12 districts prior to appraisal. The Bank’s
global experience in developing such projects supporting rehabilitation, reconstruction and
development in post conflict environments was also utilized in formulating the second
phase of the project (and in the subsequent re-structuring). It was noted that the project was
prepared on the basis of the 2002 ceasefire agreement, which anticipated the LTTE
allowing civilian traffic through their territory, thus paving the way for economic
development.
Assessment of project design: At the time of project preparation, the original design was
assessed appropriate based on the lessons learned from NEIAP and incorporating political
reality of both then-government and LTTE. The original project design was heavy on
irrigation and village infrastructure due to deterioration of the basic social services and lack
of maintenance for several years. These issues underpinned the basis for a strong social
and economic recovery. The restructuring in 2007, incorporated the lessons learnt through
implementation of the CDLIP in the south of Sri Lanka and changes of KPIs. Several
alternatives were considered in arriving at the chosen re-design, which included simple and
clear principles, empowerment of local communities, and capacity building. The
restructurings that followed responded to challenges and emergency situations that
emerged during project implementation and the willingness of both the government and
the Bank to adapt the project to be an effective vehicle to address to the needs of war-torn
communities and the most vulnerable.
Adequacy of Government Commitment: The Government’s response to developing the war
affected area was based on its Development Framework. GOSL placed particular emphasis
on the achievement of equitable growth and the reduction of regional disparities in North,
East and adjoining areas. Demonstrating its commitment to accelerating livelihood
development and rural poverty reduction, the Government launched the Re-awakening
Project. Through this project, the Government proposed to bring about a comprehensive
and integrated development of villages in the war affected areas. This was the flagship
project that was supported by the Government from inception till completion.
Assessment of risks: The project preparation team correctly identified a varied set of risks
and laid out pertinent mitigation measures as well as credit conditions and covenants. The
team also recognized that the emergency situation in the provinces posed several likely
social and operational risks and had established a Risk Identification Worksheet early in
the appraisal process. It rated the overall residual risk as high. The risk associated with a
return to full conflict materialized in 2007, but the worsening situation was beyond the
capacity of the planned mitigation measures. As a result, the project could not proceed with


                                              10
any substantial work within the conflict areas for a period of two years. The Sri Lankan
Supreme Court’s decision to create the Northern and Eastern provinces from the prior
North-Eastern Province was an unforeseen risk and thus there were no mitigation measure
in place. The VDOs were registered initially with the project and finally with the Divisional
Secretariat for supervision and monitoring. At the time of the ICRR, all VDOs under the
project have a legal basis of existence. But, the continuity of the VDOs is questionable due
to the bureaucratic nature of the Divisional Secretariat.

2.2 Implementation
Over the ten years of project implementation, which started in 2004 and ended in 2014, the
project faced many challenges, including the escalation of the civil war and the surge of
IDPs, the institutional separation of a key target province into two, the massive return of
IDPs following the end of the conflict, and several natural disasters (droughts and floods).
Despite the uncertainties, recurrent challenges and emergency situations, the project
maintained implementation integrity and continued to support the most vulnerable and
those affected by the civil war and natural calamity throughout the implementation period.
Implementation can be divided into three major periods: (i) from effectiveness in 2004 to
the mid-term review in 2007; (ii) from then to the end of 2010; and (iii) the final four years
when the flood damage rehabilitation funding was provided until the end of December
2014.
The first period (of NEIAP 2) featured problems of effectiveness. The peace process got
stalled and armed conflict between GOSL forces and LTTE escalated with several project
districts impacted due to temporary displacement of communities from project villages.
Activities in about twenty percent of project villages were temporarily suspended due to
lack of households to implement collective activities in these villages. Much of the
community and irrigation infrastructure to be financed by the project was delayed due to
problems in mobilizing consultants, preparing village development plans, and procuring
construction materials. Another important factor contributing to the limited
implementation was high turnover of project staff including three Project Directors. Also,
communication and coordination between PMU and district staff was less than effective
due to the escalation of the war and regular closure of the PMU in Trincomalee.
Second period started with the Mid Term Review (MTR). At MTR, the achievement of
PDOs was rated as moderately satisfactory but implementation progress was rated as poor.
By the end of 2007, only nine percent of funds had been disbursed and weaknesses in
procurement, environmental safeguards and project management were flagged. It was
therefore necessary to re-structure the project, and a greater emphasis was placed on rural
livelihoods and ensuring interventions targeted the poorest and most vulnerable. The newly
created VDOs were tasked to manage a substantial part of the funds for Component 1 (and
to a lesser extent Component 2) with oversight from project district financial assistants
reporting to provincial PMUs. The third period essentially focused on flood repair works
while the VDO and CDD interventions continued in the previous areas. A third PMU was

                                             11
established to manage the four flood affected districts. A number of factors influenced the
various stages of implementation, notably:
•   End of Ceasefire and Resumption of the Conflict: The 2002 ceasefire agreement
    was broken in 2005 after just one year of project implementation and intensified by
    2007. Many people were once again displaced and the project could not function in a
    number of districts. With the end of the conflict in 2009 and the rapid demining of
    many areas, the project’s implementation was accelerated, with irrigation rehabilitation
    works and infrastructure activities in particular intensified.
•   Change of Implementation Arrangements: The 1987 Indo-Sri Lanka Accord had
    recognized the Northeast as “the historical habitat of the Tamil speaking people of Sri
    Lanka” and created the Northeast Province as one administrative unit with one elected
    council. NEIAP was formulated on this basis and implemented under the oversight of
    this Council. NEIAP 2 (currently recognized as the Re-awakening Project) was
    similarly formulated, but in October 2006 the Northeast Province was once again sub
    divided into Northern and Eastern Provinces. This necessitated the project establishing
    additional Provincial PMUs (and recruiting additional staff) and developing an
    implementation modality that gave more responsibility to the project management unit
    rather than the previous district government implementation approach.
•   Change of Ministries: Sri Lankan Supreme Court’s decision to divide the North-East
    province into two undermined the plan to move implementation responsibility from
    North-East Provincial Council (NEPC) to Interim Administrator Council (IAC). At the
    end of the conflict in 2009, the Ministry of Economic Development (MED) was created
    and took over the project from the Ministry of Nation Building and Estate
    Development. It took some time for the new Ministry to become familiar with Bank
    project operations and procedures, which lead to slow implementation for a period.
•   Erratic Rainfall: The northeast monsoon is characterized by flood – drought cycles
    that appear to have become more severe in recent years. Many of the project
    beneficiaries depend upon subsistence farming for food and income and such events
    can cause significant hardship to people already vulnerable in the post conflict
    situation. Rains in 2010, which were much heavier than normal, led to floods that
    continued through to 2011 and affected most parts of Sri Lanka. In 2013, the monsoon
    was delayed and brought very low precipitation (less than 40 percent of the mean);
    leading to a prolonged drought and crop losses in many districts, with tanks and hand
    dug wells running dry. In June 2014, Sri Lanka once again experienced heavy
    prolonged rains leading to floods, landslides and further crop losses. One consequence
    of these two years of erratic rainfall was the lower loan recovery rates and reduced
    funds available in VDO revolving funds noted by the ICRR mission.
•   Adoption of the VDO Approach: Based on the successful experience of the CDLIP
    in the south of Sri Lanka, the GOSL and the Bank agreed that the project approach


                                            12
    should change to VDO-based development in 2007. This streamlined the operations
    and implementation as villages now had only a single window (rather than multiple
    CBOs) in each village, improved project management at the village level and required
    democratically elected leaders and paid community resource persons (CRPs). Decision
    making for revolving funds and grants, and the prioritization of projects for critical
    community infrastructure both became more rapid, while the community committees
    and greater beneficiary involvement has contributed to the many successful community
    based projects under Component 1.
•   Increase in Project Staff: As shown in Table 1, the number of project staff increased
    over time and especially after the end of the conflict when a need for community
    mobilizers became apparent, with each mobilizer working with 4-5 VDOs and CRPs.
    The additional financings also led to an increase in project technical staff who worked
    on the infrastructure design and supervision of works, thus providing an improved
    speed of design work as well as much-needed oversight of the infrastructure developed.
•   Bank Responses: The termination of the civil war in 2009 and the floods of 2010 led
    to the Bank providing additional financing to the project. The first additional financing
    (2007) supported additional IDPs as they returned home at the end of the conflict and
    improved roads and other infrastructure. The Second/Third Additional Financing
    (2011) responded to the floods of 2010/2011 and expanded project activities to an
    additional four central Province districts. Roads were now given priority and the project
    was re-structured to reflect this. The budget was modified to reduce funding to
    irrigation works in favor of more roads and more drinking water supply projects.
The Bank’s responses to these events were quick and commendable, demonstrating the
Bank’s ability to respond to emergencies. However, it should be noted that the
documentation of the changes made to the project was not always complete, leading to a
reporting gap concerning the changes made.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The M&E system of the project followed the M&E framework as articulated in the Results
Framework of the PAD, and as amended from time to time. As a result of restructuring,
the nine KPIs replaced the original four KPIs to reflect actual project outcomes.
The database archive at the PMU level was maintained with consolidated numbers, but was
sometimes lacking in the detail necessary for analysis. During the course of
implementation, the project effectively moved from traditional reporting on the basis of
secondary data, to developing and implementing an M&E Plan and integrating validated
reported figures in the system, thus providing necessary credibility to the reported progress
of the project. This system for data validation and development of M&E Plan was
introduced as a result of the Bank’s Mission recommendations. In addition, during the
course of the project, the M&E system also managed to establish a clear separation of


                                             13
functions between the implementing team and those responsible for monitoring and
progress reporting, providing the required impartiality.
The tools developed and utilized for data collection and reporting corresponded to project
requirements. The richness of detail in data collection was possible because of this
elaborate set of data collection tools. The data analysis was predominantly desk-based and
mostly involved comparing last period of data reported with the new data reported. Tools
used for analysis comprised pivot tables and adequately satisfies the analytical
requirements of the reports; in case of any unexplained variance in data, it was then referred
back to the field for clarification or rectification as the case may be. This was also followed
up by a mandatory field-based data validation exercise carried out at district and provincial
level, to ensure compliance prior to the conclusion of any financial transaction.
The frequency of data collection was monthly, while reporting occurred on a quarterly
basis. The Management was found to have used the findings of M&E for decision-making
as evidenced through the minutes of the Deputy Project Directors’ Meetings held on a
monthly basis. Accordingly, this satisfies the requirement of timeliness of M&E reporting.
The data was maintained both manually and digitally. At the village level the databases of
micro-finance loans were meticulously kept by the CPRs. At the project office level, among
other interventions, data on infrastructure was also effectively maintained with all its sub-
variables, as required for effective desk monitoring. The data was stored in external hard
drive and was updated periodically.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Project implementation complied with the Bank’s safeguards and fiduciary requirements.
Regular and interim supervision missions together with frequent meetings between task
team members and the PPMUs were conducted to ensure adequate monitoring and
supervision.
(a)     Environmental safeguards.
Implementation of environmental safeguards at the close of the project is rated as
Satisfactory. The mission notes that the project Environmental Officer and regional team
maintained good practices relating to environmental standards. The team paid particular
attention to environmental safeguards for to any work on major structures such as tanks,
main canals and drainage works. As the work mainly focused on rehabilitation, no major
environmental impacts were expected. All sub-projects were completed as of December
2014 and all respective Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) have been well
implemented according to the final monitoring report submitted to the Bank.
Environmental Audits were conducted in three phases over the last 4-year period, showing
significant improvement in the implementation of environmental management practices in
the field, both during and after the construction phase, across all 16 districts.



                                              14
Apart from this, a number of initiatives were taken by the project to implement safeguards
above and beyond the requirements of the Environmental and Social Management
Framework (ESMF) in order to ensure that safeguards interventions are sustainable. An
environmental and pest management based capacity-building program was implemented
during the lifetime of the project, including training for both project staff and communities,
on subjects such as environmental protection, integrated pest management, water pollution
and management and organic farming. Compliance monitoring and reporting to the Bank
has been achieved in a timely and well-documented manner, with records of monitoring
visits, as well as photo documentation carried out according to the mechanisms set forth in
the ESMF.
(b)    Social safeguards
The overall progress related to social safeguards compliance and development was rated
as satisfactory. This is due to the visible interventions in community prioritized social and
economic infrastructure activities to restore livelihoods, enhance agricultural production
and incomes, and build capacity for sustainable social and economic reintegration. The
project has been focused on social and economic supports to the female-headed families,
poor, vulnerable groups especially disable persons and ex- combatants. It should be noted
that the term vulnerable was not used in the project to denote IDPs, despite their loss of
assets and livelihoods.
The existing social issues had been identified during the VDO preparation process that took
place with the participation of village members in conflict-affected districts and involved
a total of 1,039 villages.
The Social Safeguard Assessment document prepared by the project indicates that the
project had not acquired any land from the private sector. However, some additional land
needed for community investments (e.g. access roads) was donated for this purpose by
their landowners on a voluntarily basis. Project interventions were limited to rehabilitation
activities, thus there were no displacement or resettlement issues.
(c)    Financial Management
The project’s financial management performance is rated satisfactory. The project followed
the report based disbursement method. A special Dollar Account was established at the
central Bank of Sri Lanka and operated according to terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Bank and GOSL.
Quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports were submitted, as required, to the Bank within 45
days of the end of the quarter. There were no delays in obtaining World Bank funds.
The project accounts were audited by the Auditor General of Sri Lanka on an annual basis.
In addition, the Internal Audit Department of Northern and Eastern Provincial Councils
carried out quarterly audits of the project at the PMU, District Project offices and



                                             15
CBO/VDO levels. Audit replies were submitted to the Bank on time and no major issues
were reported.
A computerized integrated project management information system was developed and
implemented for the project comprising a networked system connecting provincial offices
to the PMU for all financial transactions.
(d)    Procurement Arrangement
Procurement of all works, goods and technical services under the project followed the
Procurement Guidelines “Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits”. Procurement
Plans were updated and cleared regularly. Procurement post and prior reviews were
conducted regularly. Annual workshops and training programs were carried out by the
Bank and the PMU. Overall project procurement performance and compliance to the
agreed procedures were satisfactory. Procurement performance was affected by not having
a qualified Specialist in-charge of procurement during the latter stages of the
project. Several lapses in the procurement process were revealed during the post review
carried out by the Bank in the recent past. Thus, project’s procurement performance at the
close of the project was rated as moderately satisfactory.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
This project is the penultimate livelihood intervention in the war affected areas, focusing
on agricultural activity, livelihood development and competiveness to promote rural
transformation. The Government is now concentrating on countrywide agricultural
modernization and rural transformation and is seeking the Bank’s support in this regard.
The presidential election in January 2015 resulted in a change of the government. The
MED, the coordinating ministry, was closed. The Ministry of Policy, Planning and
Economic Affairs became the responsible ministry for this project in April 2015. In
general, the project outcomes have been positively received by the new government. After
the termination of the project, in order to complete project activities, including payment
settlement and completing reporting, the government agreed to maintain more than 100
PMU staff. Though the project implementation ended on December 31, 2014 and the grace
period ended on April 30, 2015, PMU continued to function till June 01, 2015.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Overall Rating: Substantial
The project objectives remain highly relevant to Sri Lanka. The project covered only 7%
of the villages within the original 12 districts that had been affected by the civil conflict.
Although the majority of non-project target IDPs and villages in the region have received
some sort of assistance from the government and other donors, the war-affected areas


                                             16
comprise a substantial portion of the country and the number of former IDPs is high. Many
former IDPs in both project and non-project communities have yet to establish stable
livelihoods able to cope with external shocks such as natural disasters such as the 2010
floods and the subsequent drought and many former IDPs are facing hardship again.
Infrastructure development to mitigate floods and droughts such as tank rehabilitation,
strengthening embankments, development of waterways, and others are still high priorities
in the areas.
This PDO was relevant to Sri Lanka since creating opportunities for marginalized
communities to improve their livelihood standards, to access basic services, and to reduce
poverty is the Government policy. The project remained consistent with the Bank CPS
(2012 – 2016) with an objective of improving livelihoods among disadvantaged groups
and advancing support to develop rural livelihoods, boost agricultural production, and
reduce poverty.
The approach of developing VDOs in each project community, which was the key tool for
empowerment of beneficiaries as well as the main thrust to develop the bottom up approach
at the village level, remains valid. This approach places the power to prioritize development
activities in the hands of the beneficiaries, especially benefitting the most vulnerable and
women.
The combination of small-scale support such as LSAs with large-scale irrigation and tank
rehabilitation, as well as feeder-roads, proved a good mix. It addressed the needs of both
men - who are said to be primarily interested in improving the productivity of rice paddy
production - as well as women, who need small scale but immediate cash and outputs from
productive activities to supplement household incomes. However, the relevance of cluster-
level income generating activities, as well as the introduction of polynet houses for
agriculture, remain to be demonstrated due to the short period since these activities were
commenced and the ambiguous results observed for these categories of activities.
The implementation modality used by the PMU was also relevant to this type of emergency
situation, permitting a rapid, targeted and flexible approach. The Community Mobilizers
(CMs) recruited under this approach – more than 100 people in 2012, comprising 20% of
all project staff – played an important role in guiding and supporting VDOs and their
associated CRPs. However, the approach implies a heavy involvement of the PMU in the
implementation process. One area of uncertainty in the implementation process has been
the role of district government staff. There appears to be a trade-off between
implementation efficiency and the sustainability of project activities. This ICR considers
that effective participation of district level officials was key to attending to the immediate
needs of IDPs and flood victims as rapidly as possible. However, it does raise concerns as
to the capacity of district government to support the VDOs, the revolving funds and
infrastructure after the completion of the project.




                                             17
The project implementation modality and arrangements are still relevant for the given
design and PDO due to their adaptability and flexibility to address the needs and
requirements of disaster affected people as and when needs arise. As a result of the robust
nature of the project model, IDPs and flood affected communities were able to obtain quick
support in a relatively short time span. The present Resettlement Ministry and Provincial
Councils have approached the Bank for extension of the project support, underscoring its
relevance.
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Overall Rating: Substantial
The project’s development objective was combined in a single statement of objectives with
four main elements that can be summarized as: (a) restoring livelihoods; (b) enhancing
agricultural production; (c) increasing incomes; and (d) building their capacity for
sustainable social and economic reintegration. In addition, the ICR looked at flood damage
rehabilitation (FDR) separately to assess the PDO.
Restoring Livelihoods: High
The KPIs related to restoring livelihoods covers eight KPIs and are listed in Table 6 below.
Six of the eight relevant KPIs have met or exceeded their targets, with a minor shortfall in
two KPIs.

      the project

The project was able to restore livelihoods for many of IDPs and members of the vulnerable
population who were affected by the civil war. It was estimated that the project helped


                                            18
more than 300,000 IDPs and refugees including around 150,000 IDPs from the official
camps to re-establish their livelihoods (see details Annex 2).
The project received additional financing twice and the total budget was doubled from US$
64.7 million to US$ 124.7 million. The target was initially set at 85,000 households at
project preparation and was finally increased to 213,000 (KPI 1) after the restructurings.
The project performance exceeded the target, reaching 222,555 households. The detail of
the beneficiary distribution is shown in the figure below.

The project proactively worked with vulnerable people, principally ex-combatants, female-
headed households and disabled people. Out of 30,724 vulnerable people within the target
villages, 18,096 people or about 60 percent became VDO members (KPI 4 – target 80
percent), and the project provided financial support to 10,775 vulnerable people, which
represent about 60 percent of all vulnerable VDO members (KPI 5). It is reported that the
main reason not all vulnerable VDO members took loans was their fear that they would not
be able to repay the loan. Although the project provided grants to some disabled and
female-headed households, the size of budget was insufficient to cover all vulnerable
people under the grant scheme.
The project was able to link around 4,000 adults and youths including ex-combatants to a
new job including overseas jobs (KPI 2: see Annex 2 for details), not to mention to the 807
CRPs who are getting in-village steady incomes by managing the VDO revolving funds
and assisting the VDOs. In terms of proportion of village youth and ex-combatants assisted
(KPI 6: target: 50%), the project data shows that it assisted 19,248 or 60% of 32,976
young/ex-combatant VDO members.
The project contributed to improving the livelihood-base of beneficiaries by improving
infrastructure. A total of US$23.35 million was disbursed to complete 4,213 community-
based infrastructure works under Component 1. More than 2,500 km of rural roads were
rehabilitated against a target of 700km (KPI 7). The project improved 1,248 community

                                                    19
water points (KPI 8: target - 1,394 water points), benefitting a reported almost 60,000
households and facilitated piped water supply connections to 19,366 households in 82
communities (KPI 9: target - 10,000 households). Anecdotal evidence, from project
documents, the Impact Assessment report prepared by the Green Tech Consultants and the
ICR mission’s own field visits, suggest that the quality and the level of maintenance of
these infrastructure is generally high. It is considered that the infrastructure investments
have contributed substantially to the improvement of beneficiary livelihoods.
Enhancing Agricultural Production: Substantial
(a) Productive Infrastructure
Productive infrastructure can be divided broadly into irrigation rehabilitation, and flood
damage rehabilitation (FDR) following the floods of 2010-11.
The project contained five sub-components for irrigation development: (1) Rehabilitation
of Irrigation Schemes under Village Rehabilitation and Development Program; (2)
Rehabilitation of Major Irrigation Schemes; (3) Rehabilitation of Irrigation Schemes under
the 2000 Minor Tanks Program; (4) Lift Irrigation for High Lands; and (5) Rehabilitation
of Irrigation Schemes under Flood Damage Rehabilitation.
A total of 94,719 ha of irrigated land was rehabilitated. This represents a 35% of increase
from the original level of 60,000 ha (see Table 7 below), but falls short of the revised (2011
Third Additional Credit) target of 114,000ha (KPI 3). The original target was 24,000 ha
but as part of the additional financing and restructuring modifications, the target was
substantially increased. Following the restructuring, rehabilitation of one large scheme
(Iranmadhu in Kilinochchi District) was taken up by the Asian Development Bank and
funds budgeted for this scheme were then used for expanding the works at Giant’s Tank.
In addition, the project needed to increase spending on roads in order to permit returning
IDPs home to re-establish their livelihoods. Even with these factors present, 85% of the
targeted rehabilitations of irrigation schemes were delivered.

   An impact evaluation carried out by the University of Peradeniya3 shows that on average,
   almost 17 percent of the project beneficiaries responded that they had more access to the
   irrigation due to the project support. The evaluation indicates that 15 percent of respondents
   believed that the enhancement of acreage under irrigation could be directly attributed to
   the project interventions. These figures are not large, as the main project focus was
   rehabilitation rather than expansion of irrigation schemes. Importantly, the evaluation
   indicates that 20 percent of interviewed respondents experienced increases in yield, despite
   the fact that the national census data show a decrease due to an extreme weather during the
   same period, i.e. floods.
   As part of the beneficiary survey undertaken during the ICRR formulation, data was
   collected from farmers on 122 schemes (minor and major), including changes in yields and
   net incomes. These data are shown in Table 8 below. The difference between pre-
   investment and post-investment can be accounted for by the serious floods and then
   droughts that affected many of the project irrigation schemes in 2014, the year the survey
   was conducted. Yields declined considerably from expected levels (although were still
   higher than pre-investment levels); this decline led to significantly higher prices and,
   hence, greater incomes despite the unfavorable circumstances. In future years, where no
   flooding or drought occurs, yields should rise and prices decline, but significant
   agricultural production enhancement is expected to be observed.

   (b) Economic and Social Infrastructure
   A total of 2,683 km of rural roads (KPI 7) have been rehabilitated. The final impact
   evaluation reveals that most of the communities have chosen the construction of rural
   roads, culverts and bridges as their first priority. This includes tarred as well as concrete
   roads that have been constructed by using local labour and materials. These roads have
   solved connectivity issues to transport paddy, other field crop and dairy production to
   markets while providing easy access to schools, health centers, and temples. The villagers
   who used to travel longer distances due to water logging during rainy seasons are also

benefitted by the construction of culverts and bridges. There are also considerable savings
in the vehicle operating cost. About 73% of the community have benefitted from
rehabilitated rural roads.

A total of 816 community water supply projects (KPI 8 and 9) have been implemented in
the project area and all of them are managed by the communities themselves. The majority
of the households in the project area have been provided with safe drinking water thereby
improving health conditions and sanitation practices. The time saved by providing access
to improved water supply sources has enabled villagers to spend their time on other income
generating activities. For example, women, who would spend a disproportionate amount
of time in collecting water, now have time to engage in other activities. Immediately after
the end of the civil war, the project initiated a mechanism for clean drinking water wells in
Northern Province so as to facilitate clean drinking water in the province. Accordingly the
project planned to clean 525 wells and tube wells and achieved 100% of its target.

(c) Flood Damage Rehabilitation
The Flood Damage Rehabilitation (FDR) was introduced in 2012 following the disastrous
floods of 2010 as part of Village Rehabilitation & Development, and Essential
Rehabilitation & Improvement to Selected major Irrigation Schemes of the project. Since
this activity covers economic infrastructure development, it is discussed here. Activities
included: (i) restoration of livelihoods through short-term employment and supporting
farmers to be ready for next cultivation; (ii) recovery of agriculture through rehabilitation
of irrigation schemes; (iii) enhanced connectivity of affected communities by repairing
rural roads; and (iv)restoration of drinking water facilities by repairing drinking water
schemes. A summary of FDR activities is shown in Annex 2.
Except for the distribution of polynet greenhouses, the vast majority of FDR resources were
dedicated to infrastructure repair and rehabilitation. About 65 percent of the sub-projects
carried out under the FDR were related to roads and bridges. The improvement of roads
had a significant impact in terms of re-establishing links between rural communities and
district/village centres, permitting them to transport produces to market, as well as
providing access to schools, clinics and other public/private services. In terms of
beneficiaries, it is estimated that the rehabilitation of roads alone benefitted more than
400,000 people throughout the 16 districts, including the four FDR districts.

Increasing Incomes: Substantial
The VDO Revolving Fund was established as the main thrust of Livelihood Support
Activities (LSA). A total of US$ 11.2 was provided from the project under Credit 1 and
Credit 2 and loaned by recipient VDOs to 43,098 and 10,258 households respectively.
Repayments on loans made from these funds were retained by CBOs and VDOs and
formed the capital for revolving funds. As a result, 130,621 people were benefitted by the
end of the project. These loans were the main factor in improving CBO/VDO members’


                                             22
incomes. More than 60 percent of VDO members were women and, according to project
M&E unit data, 88 percent of women within target communities were covered from the
total number of loans issued, although no numbers appear to be available as to the
proportion of borrowers who were female.
The project data show that, although only 59 percent of vulnerable people joined the VDOs
within their communities (as against the KPI 4 target of 80 percent), 60 percent of those
who did join obtained livelihood financing, exceeding the 50 percent target (KPI 5).
A completion survey4 conducted by consultants after the termination of the project found
that, overall, the project beneficiaries have performed better in terms of income and saving
compared with non-project beneficiaries (see Table 9). Project beneficiaries are earning
approximately 30% higher incomes compared with the non-project group. The same
pattern is found in savings -- the accumulated savings by project beneficiaries is more than
100% higher on average than for non-beneficiaries.

This result is consistent with the above mentioned impact assessment - mean family income
increased by 30%, while 37% of respondents saved some money. The project data also
show that 97% of those who received the finances from the VDO-LSA funds answered that
they improved their income levels, and 88% of them said that they also improved their
social status.
Building capacity for sustainable social and economic reintegration: Modest
Repayment rates on LSA loans over the period 2011-2014 averaged approximately 87
percent, although these rates were significantly affected in 2012 and 2013 by the effects of
both flooding and drought (see the Figure 1 in Annex 3), particularly in the districts of
Vavuniya and Mullaitivu. While repayment rates below 95 percent would be generally
unacceptable for a microfinance organization, rendering it unsustainable in the long term.
The strong financial returns to the surveyed LSA investment and the ability of all VDOs to
revolve the funds over a period of years, reflects the sustainability of this model. The

    The team interviewed 1,508 project beneficiaries and 250 non-project beneficiaries.


                                                      23
overhead costs of maintaining these revolving funds are minimal, as the only overhead-
costs paid from revolving funds are the salaries of the CRPs. Moreover, it is important to
bear in mind that the creation of revolving funds was not one of the objectives of the
project. Rather, the LSA revolving funds were intended to facilitate and enable the creation
of new livelihoods and secondarily to empower target communities through the
management and control of their own financial resources, this has clearly been achieved.
The majority of VDOs have acquired the necessary organizational capacity to be viable
financial, administrative, and operational entities with 70 percent being graded category A
or B by the end of the implementation period (see Table 10). Details of the grading results
and grading methods are in Annex 2. However, 20 VDOs have reportedly stopped working.
Many VDOs are playing a pivotal role to implement projects assisted from other donors.
The financial and social capital developed, especially in the last two years, enables them
to enhance further the role of VDOs as a key village development institution. Furthermore,
some VDOs play a role in conflict management and resolution within the community.
Changes of VDO office holders has occurred in a number of VDOs and 61 percent of VDO
main committee members are women. However, the risk of elite capture of VDOs exists;
it was noted in some communities that individual members had received multiple loans
although this may simply reflect the willingness of some households to take on repeated
debt to finance productive activities.
Upon closure of the project, the role of men in VDOs might decrease, as women are
generally more active in the revolving funds, while men were proactively involved in
infrastructure development. As long as the revolving fund capital is available, LSAs will
most likely be sustained through revolving funds, but people who do not receive loans may
question the role of VDO as a village development entity.
3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Modest
Pre-Investment Economic and Financial Analysis
Using a 12 percent discount rate, the PAD estimated Net Present Values (NPVs) in the
region of SLR 5,750 per acre for minor irrigation scheme investments and SLR 14,500 for
major irrigation works. This translated into financial internal rates of return (FIRRs) of
approximately 23 percent and economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) of 27 percent for
minor tank investments. For the Giant’s Tank, FIRRs and EIRRs were estimated as in the
region of 20-23 percent and 26-30 percent respectively, depending on the phasing of
benefits. No quantitative estimates for returns to other primary benefit areas defined above
were given.
Post-Investment Economic and Financial Analysis
As part of the ICRR, NPVs and IRRs were estimated for irrigation infrastructure (small-
scale rehabilitation, minor expansion as well as repair of larger schemes under Component


                                            24
2. Returns were also calculated for LSA activities funded under VDO loans and clusters
(the latter directly funded by the project). No estimates were prepared for financial or
economic returns to road or water supply investments or for capacity building or training
as there was insufficient data to permit quantification of such returns. Finally, estimated
rates of return were prepared for the entire project.
When financial benefits were assessed for these activities against total project costs, an
FIRR of 14.6 percent and an NPV of SLR 2,354 million (USD 18 million) were
generated. While the FIRR may appear only marginally positive against the discount factor
of 12 percent typically applied for NPV calculations, it is important to consider that these
financial benefits relate to only a minority of the activities undertaken under the project,
excluding returns to drinking water supply, roads, community infrastructure and training
for which financial returns are difficult to quantify. Among the non-financial benefits that
should be mentioned, it is worth noting that based on the beneficiary survey, it can be
estimated that over 40,000 person years of employment were created annually by the
project, primarily from the LSA investments.
The economic analysis considered possible adjustments for labor costs, real effective
exchange rates and the import parity price of rice (the principal agricultural output of
project investments). However, as an over-valuation of labor costs is almost balanced by
the over-pricing of income from rice, and the real effective exchange rate is considered
close to the nominal rate (see Annex 3), the resulting total project EIRR is little changed
from that calculated on a financial basis (see Table 11).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
The project achieved the PDO. That the project achieved so much despite the challenges
of the war, flood and drought, while also increasing the size of the target population from
400,000 at project preparation to more than one million with the restructuring is seen as
commendable. All KPIs have achieved or exceeded their targets, with moderate
shortcomings in three indicators as shown in Table 6,. In addition, it also: (a) supported the
creation and capacity development of 805 CBOs/VDOs; (b) benefitted more than 200,000
people through the provision of livelihood opportunities; (c) assisted nearly 400,000
households through the construction and rehabilitation of village level infrastructure; (d)


                                               25
aided some 60,000 households through repair and rehabilitation of major and minor
irrigation schemes, and; (e) provided emergency relief to nearly half million households
suffering from flood damage. In total, more than 1.16 million households benefitted
significantly from project activities.
KPIs 3 and 8 were not achieved, since other donor funded projects concentrated on
irrigation and drinking water supply activities in the project area. KPI 4 was not achieved
since most of the vulnerable people concentrated in re-establishing their livelihoods rather
than spending time on community activities. In fact, all the beneficiaries were severely
affected by the war and could be considered as vulnerable, even though VDOs categorized
poorest of the poor as vulnerable.
The project contributed to halving “Poorest” and “Poor” population from around 46,000 to
21,000, while doubling the “Middle (from around 43,000 to 84,500)” and “Wealthy (from
around 9,000 to 18,000)”. There are many successful stories among loan borrowers. Its
focus on vulnerable people including youth and ex-combatants and disadvantaged as well
as women headed household. As a result, it played a role of social safety-network.
Even though there was a change in the PDO in terms of additional project area, the team
did not carry out a split evaluation, since the project was performing satisfactorily before
and after the change in the PDO.
Based on the Substantial rating for the Relevance of Objectives, Design and
Implementation; Substantial rating for the achievement of the Project Development
Objectives; and Modest rating for Efficiency, the overall rating of the project is
Satisfactory.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development Poverty Impact
The project was successful in increasing incomes among beneficiaries who benefited from
a range of project activities including: the VDO LSA fund (130,621 people); the FEEP
with 607 beneficiaries; and cluster level livelihood support activities, with 9,764
beneficiaries.
For agricultural, fisheries and small industry investments, earnings net of operating and
labor costs exceeded total investment costs by the end of the first year of operation in all
cases, and averaged 300, 434 and 348 percent of initial investment respectively. In a
number of cases, they achieved in excess of 500 percent returns in a single year. As VDO
loans generally are either seasonal or annual in nature, this result is not surprising.
For livestock and small business investments, returns were generally lower, but still
averaged net earnings of 193 and 169 percent of investment costs respectively in the first
year of operation. Interest free loans, given by some VDOs to the poorest wealth ranking
households in their communities, also generated strong net returns. The only LSA category

                                            26
in which financial performance was relatively disappointing was for the pilot polynet
greenhouse program. As a result of the project activities, more than 1,800 people got a job
including overseas jobs. In addition, all 805 VDOs have a CRP, paid from VDO resources,
to manage the revolving funds. Many VDO loans and grants, FEEP as well as the cluster
level, have generated employment, while non-agricultural youth employment created
across the 12 districts through training programs and related activities totals 3,949. In
addition, improved livelihoods and agriculture activities, supported through loans, have
directly benefitted 10,775 vulnerable people. In total 222,555 households benefitted from
LSA activities.
Gender Aspects
The project did not have a specific focus on gender, nor indicators to measure same.
However, according to the project report, more than 400,000 women received benefits from
the project. Women comprised not only 66 percent of all VDO members, but also the
majority of the members of most of the VDO committees, including the main committee
(61 percent) and sub-committees responsible for managing the loan funds (68 percent).
Only on the infrastructure sub-committees were women not in the majority. In addition, 75
percent of VDO members obtained the VDO loans and the majority of borrowers were
stated to be women, although no gender-specific data on borrowers is available. All FEEP
grants were provided to women-headed families. Women have diversified their household
economy and their confidence level has significantly improved.
Social Development
A total of US$ 33.35 million was disbursed to complete 4,213 infrastructure activities. All
infrastructure was developed on the basis of community priorities. After the restructuring
in 2007, the project started creating VDOs at every project village under Batch-II, while
maintaining the approach to work with CBOs in parallel to complete Batch-I activities. The
VDO development approach adopted a bottom-up approach while empowering villagers
in planning and decision-making. In addition, the project provided capacity building
training for more than 100,000 people covering sub-project management skills such as
leadership, bookkeeping, plan preparation, and procurement management, as well as
technical training such as poultry, livestock raising, agriculture, and small businesses.
VDOs have begun to address the challenging area of nutritional quality of diets and started
village level interventions to improve nutritional outcomes.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
The institutional strengthening was substantial, especially at the village level through
developing a VDO in each of 805 villages. The impacts could have been much more
profound if the project adopted this approach from Batch-I. With the restructuring in 2007,
VDOs started functioning as the key community based institutions. With the change, the
CDD approach became robust having a transparent structure with a group of VDO leaders
as well as a couple of community committees such as Procurement, Economic Promotion,

                                            27
and Infrastructure Committees. A CRP was also appointed by the VDO to support village-
based activities, especially to support LSAs and VDO LSA loans. The VDOs and CBOs
prepared a total of 1,039 Village Development Plans (VDPs), the procurements of goods
and services were managed by procurement committees, and that also oversaw
infrastructure construction. It is important to note that all infrastructure sub-projects at the
community level had to pass the environmental screening process, based on the
Environmental Safeguard Management Framework (ESMF). This was managed by the
VDOs with technical support from the project. In addition, the VDPs include an Operation
and Maintenance (O&M) plan. These VDO activities helped community leaders to manage
CDD activities and the community as a whole, which helped develop their capacities.
Although there is no quantitative data available to show the level of social development,
the completion of infrastructure development and maintaining VDO revolving funds
clearly show that the project was largely successful in empowering villagers, especially
leaders. The project adopted the direct execution modality by strengthening the capacity of
PMU, after the restructuring. This change was necessary given the emergency situation
after the war and the flood. This suggests, however, that the development of the
government capacity may no longer have been the higher priority after the war in such a
challenging environment.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
VDO LSA loans were given to individuals under a group guarantee mechanism which
worked to strengthen the bond among group members who in turn helped each other. In
addition, many of groups have started saving and the accumulative amount of saving has
reached almost SLR 150 million (US$ 1.1 million). As a result of easy access to finance
with low interest rates, villagers are now able to fulfill many of their financial needs
through VDO revolving loan funds, resulting in reduced activities of informal
moneylenders.
The project conducted environmental auditing to identify the standards in the
environmental management and then recognize the adherence to them during a project
intervention. Comparing before and after the restructuring, the overall environmental
performance score improved from 4.3 to 5.4. The series of environmental activities helped
the VDO leaders and villagers to understand the importance of ESMF and developing
mitigation measures. More importantly, the environmental screening with the aid of ESMF,
as well as the implementation of environmental audits, strengthened the VDOs’ capacity
to examine community-based infrastructure plans and re-prioritize items based on their
environmental impact. As a result, many VDO members proactively engaged in
environmental protection and many primary schools started to adopt environmental
education as a part of their after-school curriculum.




                                              28
The project has also been instrumental in bringing peoples’ representatives, government
officers and beneficiaries together in the planning process and implementing livelihood
activities at local level.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Substantial
Four risks to the PDO were identified in the PAD: the first one is associated to civil war;
the second one is about the implementation entity; the third one is on the CBOs/VDOs; and
the last one is about the potential encroachment of private lands by developing
infrastructure. In terms of risks to the PDO, the third risk on the benefits created by
developing sub-projects and livelihoods of CBOs/VDOs’ members remains substantial.
The other risks were largely mitigated by the measures set by the project design and
avoided during the project implementation, but the CBOs/VDOs’ institutional capacity
may not be sufficiently developed to keep sustaining the local institutions.
The most critical risk of the existing of CBOs/VDO depends upon the maintenance of the
revolving funds. The average repayment rates of 87 percent on the revolving funds is
considered high given that the majority of small loan recipients were in “very poor” or
“poor” categories. But the repayment rate would suggest that they sooner or later will
require additional replenishment, which makes the CBO/VDO revolving funds at risk
(normally, the sustainable rate of revolving fund is around 95 percent). The role of CRPs
is also critical in maintaining the revolving funds. However, the eventual reduction of the
primary capital suggests that some VDO revolving funds will face difficulties in
maintaining salary payments to the CRPs unless current repayment or interest rates are
increased.
The CBOs/VDOs, in most part, are functioning on a democratic basis, elections are held
periodically basis and, in many cases, change of leadership (VDO office bearers) has taken
place. However, the lack of oversight of the project and/or the government officers,
especially from the districts might lead to a situation where VDOs are influenced by local
elites and village politics. There is a risk of disintegrating VDOs as 20 VDOs have already
ceased operating.
In addition, the CBO/VDO assessment reveals (see Annex 2 for the details of assessment
and the classification categories) that only one third of remaining 785 CBO/VDOs were
classified as category “A”; the majorities are “B” and “C”, and about 5% of CBO/VDOs
were under “D”, which indicates risk of collapse. Many CBO/VDOs are registered as a
legal entity, but do not have an official governing authority at the village level; they are
semi-private entities. Although some CBO/VDOs appeared to play a role to settle local
disputes, they cannot be assumed as a parallel entity to the village governments and it is
premature to consider that all of CBO/VDOs will continue functioning in the longer-term
without external assistance.

                                            29
Sustainability of infrastructure sub-projects implemented by the Provincial Departments is
a question since they do not have adequate funds to carry out regular operation and
maintenance (O&M) activities. However, sustainability of village level infrastructure
depends largely on the O&M capacity of responsible VDOs and communities. Most of the
VDOs have O&M funds in their savings account but they need additional funding support
for technical services. Without regular supervision and monitoring by the relevant
institutions, long term sustainability of sub-projects could likely be jeopardized.



5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
Because of NEIAP’s success, for which the ICR completed in 2005 was rated satisfactory,
the design did not propose significant changes - the project was essentially structured as
the second phase of NEIAP. The project components were not complex and the PDO was
attainable. The approach to enhance community institutions by setting up revolving funds
that enabled war-affected poor and the weak to develop their own feasible enterprises was
assessed as satisfactory. In light of uncertainties of the civil war, the project design also
allowed some needed flexibility in implementation, particularly regarding institutional set-
ups. This was effective in adapting the project activities to support immediate crises and
emergencies. The escalating war and increase of IDPs and so many other factors affected
the project design and inevitably implementation, which subsequently led to restructure.
However, it was assessed that the restructuring were the result of responding to changing
circumstances and repeated emergencies, rather than the weakness of the initial project
design.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
Bank’s supervision was carried out regularly except during the period of heightened
conflict from 2006 to 2009. There were no major delays in the Bank’s inputs, including the
mid-term review, which was conducted in March 2007 despite the conflict. The supervision
missions before the MTR highlighted serious delays in project implementation and
disbursement due to the conflict. It is noted from the Implementation Status and Result
(ISR) reports and the MTR aide memoire that the Bank demonstrated its commitment to
deliver results despite the worsening situation. As the project context changed with the end
of the conflict and the severe, widespread flooding in 2010, the Bank was sufficiently
flexible to offer further support through two additional financings, thus gaining the trust of
the government and the people who were affected. The Bank also responded rapidly to the

                                             30
Sri Lankan Supreme Court’s decision to separate the North Eastern province into two, by
allowing the project to establish new coordination offices in each province. Some
shortcomings in Bank supervision and operation was observed found in keeping records
for the changes made in outcome indicators replaced by output indicators.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
It is important to recall that the project functioned for a number of years during a period of
intense civil conflict and uncertainty. The Bank was frequently recognized as an important
and trustworthy partner by both GOSL and LTTE during this time and the project was
successful in working in conflict areas - such as Giant’s Tank, which formed part of the
front line between the two sides - thanks to this reputation. This demonstrates that the Bank
played an important non-political role in maintaining vital infrastructure and supporting
populations who urgently needed assistance in re-establishing their livelihoods. After the
war and the 2010 floods, the Bank also quickly responded to the needs of people and
demonstrated its capacity to mobilize both human and financial resources based on GOSL
requests. The borrower felt that the Bank’s support was constant and did not experience
major delays in project implementation. The restructurings and two additional financings,
contributed to accelerating implementation and government capacities were buttressed by
proactive Bank implementation support.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The government showed a strong commitment to support people who urgently needed
assistance in conflict areas throughout preparation and implementation. The Special Task
Force that was appointed by the Government to monitor all its activities in the Northern
and Eastern Provinces facilitated smooth implementation of the project. Regular project
reviews were held at district level by MED. The government’s willingness to borrow
substantial additional amounts twice speaks to this high level of commitment. After the
war, the government shifted the responsible entity from the NEPC to the MED, which went
smoothly as the PMU was responsible in implementation. The 2015 election resulted in a
change of the government, which led the restructuring of ministries. As a result, the MED
was no longer responsible entity to implement the project and there was no responsible
ministry identified at the time of the ICR. As shown in maintaining the PMU staffing even
after the closure, however, the ownership of the project by the government continued to be
high and the GOSL remains committed to the project. The Government’s action to assist
the war affected people during project implementation and even thereafter is
commendable.

Rating: Satisfactory
The delay and the end of the civil conflict triggered the increase of PMU’s role in
implementation, while reducing the role of district government. It gradually started acting
as the project executing agency at both national and district levels, while the provincial and
district governments took the role of coordination and plan approval. It has to be noted,
however, that the direct execution by the PMU was much more favorable modality for such
an emergency situation, especially upon the end of the war to assist IDPs to return their
hometowns by fixing roads and putting basic infrastructure such as water-supply systems
as quickly as possible. With the support from the Bank, the PMU and its staff coordinated
well with the district governments and succeeded in prioritizing the use of the resources
through restructuring the fund allocation for irrigation scheme work that was an immediate
need for IDPs. Anecdotal evidences also show that the 2010 flood was a turning point in
causing attitude change of PMU staff and villagers. As many of PMU staff worked directly
with VDO members, in the aftermath of the flood, PMU staff contacted with them and
offered voluntary support, which made their relationships with villagers closer and helped
develop good relations. As a result, the project succeeded in overcoming early
implementation delays and gained trusts from people who lost family members and
livelihood. Financial management, procurement administration and safeguards have been
managed as per agreed guidelines.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The delays experienced during the initial implementation period could not readily be
avoided due to the impact of the worsening civil war. It was not an easy decision to develop
and implement a project which operated largely within territories held by the LTTE. The
implementers maintained non-political stance and gained trusts from both sides – the
GOSL and LTTE. The commitment of the government to assist the IDPs and vulnerable
regardless of people’s political preferences was highly appreciated by beneficiaries.
Although there is an issue of sustainability in VDOs, the GOSL and PMU staff succeeded
in implementing the demanding tasks and achieving the PDO.
6. Lessons Learned
This section considers lessons learned in two broad categories: (a) lessons applicable to
operations in a setting dominated by armed conflict and/or natural disasters, and; (b)
lessons applicable to projects using a CDD approach.




                                             32
(a) Conflict and Natural Disaster Response Operations

 •   Flexibility in operations management and project structure is critical where the
     exogenous setting is uncertain. It is believed that a key factor in project success was
     the ability of both the Bank and the project to respond rapidly and appropriately to
     new circumstances including the suspension, renewal and eventual termination of the
     civil conflict (all resulting in rapid changes in resettlement patterns), and the
     occurrence of severe floods and subsequently drought in the project area;
 •   Notwithstanding the above, the speedy response to changing circumstances and,
     in particular, the catastrophic flooding which affected Sri Lanka in 2010, caused
     some problems, and it may be worth considering these in any future exercise
     involving similar circumstances and needs. Two specific areas should be noted.
     Firstly, the many rapidly effected changes that occurred in the project over the 10-
     year implementation period resulted in a number of cases in a ‘weak’ paper trail.
     Sometimes, the prior indicators and target levels were of only limited relevance to
     the revised project structure. While both were revised with each approved change in
     the project, the process was not always complete. In some cases, targets were listed
     as ‘continued’ where no previous target had been set. Furthermore, although an
     extensive baseline study was conducted in 2008, it provided little information with
     respect to many of the key indicators used.
 •   While the incorporation of the USD 48 million emergency flood response as the 3rd
     Additional Financing to the project enabled a rapid response to a very serious
     situation, the inclusion of a major infrastructure element within what was
     essentially a community development project required considerable
     modifications to project activities. Four new districts were included, the flood
     response portion did not have a community focus (and no VDOs were created in these
     areas), and new administrative systems were required.
(b) Community Driven Development Operations
 •   Community-managed livelihood loan programs can be very effective in reducing
     poverty. The project reduced the proportion of families ranked as ‘poorest’ and
     ‘poor’ from 73 percent to 48 percent over a period of six years or less (some initial
     rankings date only from 2013), while the poorest category alone dropped from 23 to
     10 percent. The wealthiest category only increased from five to nine percent,
     indicating that most benefits went to the poorer households.
 •   The concept of using Community Resource Persons (CRPs) was proven to be
     both beneficial and sustainable. CRPs, generally recruited from young educated
     women who were members of the community, facilitated a number of functions in


                                            33
    each community - including record keeping, calling of meetings for participatory
    decision-making, and the review of applications to community loan funds – that have
    often failed to function effectively in other circumstances. The project paid the wages
    of the CRPs for only the first year of their employment; beyond this period their costs
    were met entirely by the community, largely through margins on community LSA
    loan activities; thus providing a high probability of sustainability as long as the
    community loans continue;
•   The lack of agreements and proper arrangements with respect to the
    implementation entity and responsibilities was a significant cause of initial
    uncertainty and delay in early implementation. Such a lack of clarity in these
    aspects is not frequent, and probably only arose due to the high level of uncertainty
    at the time of design. While a strong PMU, staffed by a multi-disciplinary team with
    an appropriate skill mix and good oversight mechanisms at field level, can provide a
    solution to implement project activities effectively under such circumstances, it
    inevitably also poses sustainability risks because of the lack of significant
    government involvement in implementation. It is important to be clear on the
    expected outcomes and consider possible implementation arrangements that take into
    account the risk of lack of involvement and sustainability at the government level.
•   It is important to carefully assess and field test new technologies (i.e. in this case,
    the polynet greenhouses) before their wide spread promotion, as well as provide
    adequate support after their introduction. In all, four designs of polynet houses were
    developed and distributed, as the early designs were not well suited to participant
    needs (e.g. too expensive and too prone to wind damage). This piloting was part of
    the project design, but even so, the number of polynet houses initially targeted for
    distribution was found to be too ambitious and was subsequently scaled back.
    Furthermore, although training was given to polynet recipients, further support
    (particularly related to marketing) was sparse.
•   It is necessary for a project of this type to have a carefully thought out exit strategy
    to ensure sustainability of community activities, such as the VDOs, beyond the
    project period. It is stressed that the VDOs display many positive aspects: (i) only 20
    of the 805 VDOs established by the project had ceased to function during the
    implementation period; (ii) all CRPs were all paid from community resources after
    the first year; (iii) community funds have already revolved to several times the value
    of the original allocation, and; (iv) there have been elections resulting in changes in
    VDO management in many communities. However, other features give rise to
    concern: (a) the failure of loan repayments to VDOs to fully compensate for losses
    and inflation will eventually reduce and eliminate their resources; (b) only
    approximately 30 percent of all VDOs were rated category ‘A’ at the end of the


                                           34
     project, and thus are considered capable of functioning fully without external support
     (although a further 40 percent were rated category ‘B’ and were considered to have
     developed good foundations, and (c) there remains the risk of internal or external
     influence on VDOs, which are not expected to be adequately supported following the
     completion of implementation. All of these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that
     many of the VDOs were only established in the last few years and therefore had
     limited time to consolidate their presence within their communities.

                                Annex 2: Outputs by Component
The project comprises four components, although the title, activities and targets of three of the
components changed over the course of implementation as a result of additional financings and
restructurings. The components were:

Component 1: Village Institutions, Infrastructure and Livelihoods Development
             (originally Village Rehabilitation and Development)

Component 2: Essential Rehabilitation and Improvements to Selected Major Irrigation
             Schemes (title unchanged during implementation)
Component 3: Community Livelihoods and Cluster Development (originally Farmer
             Organization Capacity Building and Empowerment and Strengthening of
             Agricultural Support Services)
Component 4: Project Implementation Support and Oversight (originally Capacity
             Building, Project Implementation Support and Project Oversight)
The following analysis focuses upon the outcomes of the finally constituted components.

Component 1: Village Institutions, Infrastructure and Livelihoods Development
This component was designed to support the rehabilitation and development of communities in
conflict-affected areas, primarily those who were affected by the prolonged civil conflict and to
which Internally Displaced People (IDPs) were returning after the cessation of the conflict.
Initially project activities were carried out with existing Community Based Organizations (CBOs)
such as Farmers Organizations, Rural Development Societies and Women’s Rural Development
Societies in the target villages. After the mid-term review (MTR), the focus was shifted to establish
a Village Development Organization (VDO) and the approach to work with CBOs was dropped.
With the Community Driven Development (CDD) approach, each village was given a budget
according to the size of the population -- resources of SLRs 6,000 per community member
(approximately US$50) and each village prepared a Village Development Plan (VDP) under Sub-
component 1, in which the community-based activities to be carried out under Sub-component 2
were specified. Before the MTR, district government led the process with CBO office bearers, but
after the MRT, the responsibility was given to VDOs to lead the process with support from the
project. The main objective of the component was to empower the poorest and the most vulnerable,
including IDPs and develop sustainable livelihoods. It is important to note that the third additional
financing on Flood Damaged Rehabilitation (FDR) did not include activities under this component
-- thus only 12 districts were involved in this component.

The principle guidelines for the allocation of budget as follows:
   •   Capacity Building Fund (10% of village allocation) to build capacity of VDOs to plan and
       facilitate their community members, including the capacity to manage livelihood funds
       (revolving loan funds);
   •   Infrastructure Fund (40% of village allocation) to develop priority village infrastructure,
       principally irrigation repair and rehabilitation, roads and potable water supplies;
   •   Livelihood Fund (50% of the village allocation) to enhance livelihoods of vulnerable and
       poor households by the provision of skill training to youth and loans to target households
       to invest in creating productive livelihoods.

Sub-component 1.1: Formation and strengthening of community institutions. This sub-
component covered the costs of village level community mobilization, planning and facilitation.
After the MTR, the project instead developed 805 pro-poor VDOs, drawing on the successful
experiences of the Community Development and Livelihood Improvement “Gemidiriya” Project
(CDLIP) in the south of Sri Lanka as well as other examples of CDD models in South Asia. The
project target villages were facilitated to understand the project’s CDD approach as well as their
responsibilities and benefits. Each project village established a VDO and elected a group of leaders
(chairperson, deputy chairperson, secretary, treasurer, and community resource person (CRP)).
The CRP was a paid position, with the project financing the first year’s salary. Subsequently, the
VDOs took over responsibility for the payment of their salaries using income generated from the
Livelihood Support Activities (LSAs).
The initial number of project target villages was set at 600. Under the first additional financing,
this number was increased to 735 villages, although no target number for villages was stated in
subsequent financings. In total, however, the project reached more than 1,048 communities (see
the table below).

Training was provided enhance project communities’ understanding of the project, acquiring skills
necessary to perform their roles under the project plans and empower community members to be
self-reliant. Areas covered included record keeping, procurement, leadership, preparation of
business plans and similar areas and was mainly targeted at VDO leaders and CRPs
The project carried out VDO grading exercises to evaluate the performance of the grading. The
majority of VDOs have acquired the necessary organizational capacity to be viable financial,
administrative, and operational entities with 70 percent being graded category A or B by the end
of the implementation period (see Table 2). However, out of 805, 20 VDOs have reportedly
stopped working. Many VDOs are playing a pivotal role to implement projects assisted from other
donors. The financial and social capital developed, especially in the last two years, enables them
to further enhance the role of VDOs as a key village development institution. Furthermore, some
VDOs play a role in conflict management and resolution within the community. . So far, 720 out
of 805 VDOs registered at the Rural Development Department under Provincial Council or Social
Service. Changes of VDO office holders have occurred in a number of VDOs and 61 percent of
VDO main committee members are women. However, the risk of elite capture of VDOs exists; it
was noted in some communities that individual members had received multiple loans although this

The project was able to link around 4,000 adults and youths including ex-combatants to a new job
including overseas jobs (local jobs: 3,669 and oversea jobs: 365), not to mention to the 807 CRPs
who are getting in-village steady incomes by managing the VDO revolving funds and assisting the
VDOs. In terms of proportion of village youth and ex-combatants assisted, the project data shows
that it assisted 19,248 or 60% of 32,976 young/ex-combatant VDO members (see table below). In
addition, the project worked with vulnerable people. As shown in Table 4, approximately 11,000
vulnerable people were assisted by the project. The Family Economic Enhance Program (FEEP)
played a pivotal role in providing a special assistance to women headed families by providing SLR
10,000. A total of 607 women were assisted through this program. It should be noted that IDPs
were not counted as vulnerable. The project assisted more than 300,000 IDPs (see Table 5).

Sub-component 1.2: Infrastructure Fund
As part of the participatory development plan for the village (VDP), village members in each
community prioritized those works which could be included within the budget for this sub-
component. Works frequently selected by participating communities included irrigation, roads and
potable water supply. Table 6 below summarises the overall achievements of community level
infrastructure.

In addition, the project rehabilitated 8,840 ha under the 2000 minor tank program. Minor irrigation
tanks belongs to custodian departments such as the provincial irrigation department and agrarian
service department. Rehabilitation programs for minor irrigation schemes were implemented by
the custodian departments with the help of farmers’ organizations. As a result of project work,
8,840 ha were rehabilitated.

Irrigation was also developed by providing beneficiaries with portable pumps; 2,974 pumps were
operational at the end of 2014 and were being used for an estimated 2,766ha of small-scale
irrigation in 11 districts. Thus, a total of 20,298 ha of irrigation was rehabilitated and expanded
under this sub-component.

construction for easy works mostly comprised gravel roads with some tar roads. Gravel roads were
well suited to labour intensive works and even the tar roads were often started as labour intensive
interventions with a machine placing the last tar layers as required. Concrete roads were sometimes
constructed in flood prone areas but were mostly confined to the FDR Program under Component
2. A total of 27kms of concrete roads, 1,048kms of gravel roads and 68.6kms of tar roads were
completed under the VDOs. It should be noted that the PDO indicator refers only to total works,
and does not provide a breakdown by component.
Water supply infrastructure works comprised capped hand dug wells and tube wells. Most piped
village water supply works were added at the time of the second re-structuring and mostly
constructed under the flood damage rehabilitation program.
By December 2014, 816 drinking water facilities (wells/tube wells/water supply schemes),
including 525 wells and tube-wells had been rehabilitated funded and were in operation. The hand-
dug wells were equipped with pulleys and buckets and the tube wells fitted with reliable and widely
available India MkIII hand pumps. Most wells were constructed/rehabilitated through VDO
activities but for the village water supply schemes the project awarded contracts due to the
complexity of the works.

Sub-component 1.3: Livelihood Fund

One half of the total resources allocated to participating project communities was assigned to be
utilized in financing investments made by community members to develop new and expanded
livelihoods (US$11.21 million). In most cases, loans were advanced on a seasonal or annual basis
at an interest rate of one percent per month. In some communities, interest-free loans were
provided to some of the poorest households. Once loans advanced from the original project
financing were repaid by recipients, they were re-issued to form a revolving fund. After the first
year of VDO functioning, responsibility for payment of CRP salaries became the responsibility of
the VDO and these costs (typically SLR 7,500 – 10,000 per month) were met from interest on the
loans.

For monitoring and evaluation purposes, the loans were grouped into a number of categories:
agriculture, livestock, fisheries, small business, small industry and interest-free loans. A total of
122,545 loans were made to VDO members over the course of implementation, approximately 40
percent of those loans derived from the original project allocation, the remainder from the
revolving fund (Table 10). The final column shows the annual average return to these investments,
calculated on the basis of a beneficiary survey conducts as part of the ICR (see Annex 5). It can
be seen that all categories generated sufficient returns to repay their original loans in less than one
year – some within a few months.

LSA loans provided by VDOs were extended only to members of small groups, which were formed
by sub-sets of VDO members. According to project M&E data, a total of 20,741 groups were
established, comprising 126,400 members, for an average of six members per group. One member
of each small group could receive a loan at a time and the other group members shared
responsibility for repayment. Small groups were also encouraged to set up their own group savings
program, which could be used as the members decided, but was generally utilized for emergency
short-term purposes, such as meeting medical or educational expenses. Small group savings are
held in local banks. By the conclusion of the implementation period, these savings had reached
more than US$ 1 million. It is worth noting that as shown in Figure 1 and Table 5 above,
Kilinochchi and Batticalloa districts - which were most affected by the conflicts - have a higher
rate of in-group savings than in other areas.

In terms of percentage of VDO memberships, the average participation remained around 55%,
which is relatively low. This is in part because the amount allocated to VDOs to fund LSA was
not sufficient to meet demand from all potential member households. All villages participating in
the project were subject to an initial wealth ranking exercise that categorized households into four
grades: (i) Poorest of poor; (ii) Poor; (iii) Average; and (iv) Rich. VDOs typically prioritized
“Poorest of poor” and “Poor” households when they provided small-scale loans -- this resulted in
non-participation and/or withdrawal of “Average” and “Rich” households in VDOs (see Table 11
and Appendix 1 and 2 for details of Wealth Ranking).

Nevertheless, the apparent impact of VDO activities on poverty among all community members
(not just VDO members) over the course of implementation was impressive, with the proportion
of the poorest households dropping by more than half, to 10 percent, even though some
communities did not receive their wealth ranking until 2013.
Technical training was also provided under this sub-component to improve vocational skills in
agriculture, livelihood development and entrepreneurships. These trainings were based on VDO
members’ demands and the district project management unit liaised with resources persons to carry
out such training. A total of 80,538 community members were registered as having taken part in
such technical training, considerably exceeding the target value of 50,000 set in 2011.
Cultivation of other field crops (OFC) was promoted by the project through linking farmers to
government agencies such as Department of Agriculture in order to both improve incomes and
enhance the food and nutrition security of beneficiaries. Some 19 percent of respondents claimed
that more of their lands had been brought into OFC cultivation.
The project also provided skill training. A total of 22,381 people received different kind of training.
Unfortunately, the training data are not organized according to subject, while VDO management
training is also included in the data. Therefore, the exact figures on skill training cannot be
extracted. However, the project did provide a wide range of training covering agriculture,
livestock, micro-business skills, accounting, and others.
As a result of these project activities, the beneficiaries have improved their incomes, savings,
livelihoods and increased assets (see Table 10, 11 and 12). Project beneficiaries are earning
approximately 30% higher incomes compared with the non-project group. The same pattern is
found in savings -- the saving amount by project beneficiaries is more than 100% higher on average
than for non-beneficiaries.

Although not funded directly from the VDOs – instead, grant funding was provided directly by the
project under the 3rd Additional Financing - the provision of polynet greenhouses was also included
in this sub-component. This activity faced a number of problems associated both with the design
of the structures (four different designs were piloted during implementation) and the training of
recipients in appropriate production techniques. The June 2014 restructuring set the target for
1,230, and this was achieved by the conclusion of the project. Nevertheless, the results from this
activity were disappointing. The average annual return to the polynet structures was only 48
percent (see Annex 3), much lower than for the comparable investments above, and in some cases
was actually negative, indicating that the owners were unable to even cover their operating costs
from the sale of output.

Component 2: Essential Rehabilitation and Improvements to Selected Major Irrigation
Schemes

Component 2 comprises three major areas of investment. The first two, contained in the original
2004 design, addressed the need to undertake repairs and rehabilitation to selected major irrigation
schemes damaged by the civil conflict and the absence of adequate maintenance during this period,
and the conduct of dam safety inspections. The second area of activity was added to the component
under the 3rd Additional Financing and comprised resources for the emergency repair of irrigation
structures damaged by the 2010 floods.

Although a number of indicators were defined for this component as part of the 3rd Additional
Financing, in only one case (dam safety) was a target established.

Rehabilitation of Selected Major Irrigation Schemes
Initially, five major schemes were included in the project for rehabilitation – the works proposed
were to counteract the effects of the war and the many years of no maintenance mainly and
included the rehabilitation of embankments of tanks and reservoirs, repairs to river offtakes
(anicuts), feeder canals, drainage channels, spillways and irrigation water reticulation systems.
Rehabilitation and expansion works would be designed and costed by GOSL Irrigation Department
staff. Works were then either contracted out or done in house and supervised by the same GOSL
staff but checked and overseen by project staff and technicians from the Dam Safety Review Panel.

As the project developed, one large scheme was taken up by the Asian Development Bank
(Iranmadhu in Killinochchi District) and funds budgeted for this scheme were then used for
expanding the works at Giant’s Tank. Five further projects were also added (Meiyankalkulam in
Batticaloa, Mugattankulam and Pavatkulam in Vavuniya, Piramanthanaru in Killinochchi and
Valukkaiaru in Jaffna) under the 3rd Additional Financing in order to address emergency repair
needs following the 2010 floods. Table 13 below illustrates the infrastructure works achieved:

Thus, a total of 54,368 ha of the major irrigation schemes were improved and expanded by
December 2014 under the initial major irrigation schemes element of the component.

(b) Flood Damage Rehabilitation
Table 14 below summarises the achievements of the project in the 16 districts affected by flooding
in 2010-2011 and subsequently requiring rehabilitation of damaged irrigation schemes. The works
were urgent so many were completed using contractors but some were also done through VDOs
(using contractors, direct labour or a combination of both). A total of 227 projects were completed.
The works were completed in the period 2012-2014 and at the conclusion of implementation water
supplies were assured for 20,053 ha.

Dam Safety Activities.
No major dam rehabilitations proposed under the project required increasing either the height of
the embankment crest or spillways or the volumes of reservoirs. As a result, no dam safeguards
activities were triggered. However, as a precautionary measure, it was agreed that the five larger
structures to be addressed under the project – Karavanhu Drainage Scheme in Ampara District,
Rugam Tank in Batticaloa District, Allai Irrigation Scheme in Trincomalee District, Pavatkulam
Irrigation Scheme in Vavuniya District and Giant’s Tank in Mannar District – should have safety
inspections carried out by consultants and the reports reviewed by the GOSL Dam Safety Review
Panel (DSRP).
The Giant’s Tank was inspected November 2005 prior to rehabilitation and the structures proposed
and rehabilitation works outlined were reported on and a number of design improvements
recommended. The DSRP also followed up with a visit in August 2010 when works (disrupted by
the conflict) were advanced. Further improvements to the design were advised and remedial works
to improve the quality of the concrete as well as the spillway, the anicut and the feeder canal were
advised.
The Karavanhu Drainage Scheme was inspected in February 2007 and comments (on design and
materials rather than safety) made by the DSRP incorporated in the design work and
implementation. Three further visits in June 2007, June 2008 and August 2010 were made as the

DSRP was concerned over flood discharges, the role the lagoon would play in this, and other
required improvements in the design and construction as it proceeded.
The Allai Irrigation Scheme was inspected October 2007 and the design proposals accepted noting
that the project engineers had compensated well for the lack of hydrological data but increasing
the safety aspects of the major infrastructure. A second visit in October 2008 to urgently inspect
some design issues led to further recommendations that were incorporated into the works, mainly
for the spillway and embankment.
The Rugam Tank was visited twice by the DSRP – the first time following a Bank review mission
that had recommended that the designs be checked - and improvements were thus recommended.
The second DSRP inspection was made in August 2010 when works were in progress and
recommendations to improve the spillway and embankment were made.
According to records provided to the ICRR team, the Pavatkulam Irrigation Scheme was not
inspected, but no explanation of this was obtained from the PMU or other source.
Following the inspections, no specific dam safety related safeguard measures were recommended
by the dam safety panel, thus no safeguards were triggered.
The Panel also trained the district irrigation engineers (responsible for the design work on the
schemes over 200 acres that the Government irrigation department would then manage) in dam
safety aspects.
As the project evolved with the 3rd Additional Financing, four additional major irrigation schemes
were added to the proposed works, they were not included in the dam safety work.

Component 3: Community Livelihoods and Cluster Development Community Livelihoods
and Cluster Development
Component three of the project focuses on establishing larger enterprises or ‘clusters’, jointly
owned and run by groups of beneficiaries, either from a single VDO or comprising members of
two or more neighbouring VDOs. Clusters are funded through grants, provided directly by the
project, and owners are required to contribute some portion of the required capital. Activities cover
a wide range of enterprises, including livestock (dairy), rice milling, trading, tailoring and
manufacturing, among others. No specific indicator target is given for the number of clusters to be
established, but a total of 54 were established (Table 8). Annual turnover for the clusters is reported
by the project M&E unit as SLR 2,649m, also easily exceeding the indicator target of SLR 700m.

The component was heavily modified under the 3rd Additional Financing of 2011. The only activity
which remained from the original design was the creation of business linkages with cluster
commercial enterprises. However, even here, the original target of 20 business linkages was
reduced to only four in 2011, and this target was easily surpassed with the creation of 10 such
linkages before the completion of implementation.
Two other indicators for this component relating to village enterprises, rather than clusters, were
fully met but not exceeded. These comprised the quantity and sales of village produce (an
increase of 80 percent) and the proportion of participating communities reporting stable or higher
prices for their output.
Component 4: Project Implementation Support and Oversight

This component comprised the Project Management Unit (PMU) and Provincial PMUs (PPMU)
and its activities. Among the tasks of the PMU and PPMUs was management of funds, supervision
of field activities (especially through the community mobilizers who provided direct support to
VDOs and their members), procurement, work planning and liaison with local government line
agencies.
Despite the numerous changes in project financing, structure and geographical scope, management
tasks generally were effectively carried out and indicator targets related to fund disbursement to
communities, the preparation and submission of financial management and other reports, and
collaboration with government agencies were all met.

A. Pre Investment Analysis
Pre Investment Economic and Financial Analysis
The initially titled Second North-East Irrigated Agriculture Project (NEIAP2) became effective on
12 October 2004 and comprised a loan amount of USD 64.7 million. In the PAD of 25 May 2004,
the economic and financial analysis identified the following primary benefits of the project:
   •   Increased agricultural production and incomes, largely arising from expanded and
       improved irrigated agriculture;
   •   Increased safety and reduced potential disruption of economic and social activities, arising
       from dam safety inspections and repairs to tank embankments;
   •   Improved profitability, productivity and sustainability of agricultural activities, due to
       training, technology adoption and improved market linkages;
   •   Improved mobility of people, goods and agricultural products, as well as accessibility to
       production areas and services for local populations, as a result of village road rehabilitation;
   •   Increased household level livelihood support and employment opportunities for target
       populations, as a result of small individual loans; and
   •   Human and institutional development and empowerment of communities from the
       formation and revitalization of farmer organizations, rural development societies, women’s
       rural development societies, as well as capacity building.
Using a 12 percent discount rate, the study estimated Net Present Values (NPVs) in the region of
SLR 5,750 per acre for minor irrigation scheme investments and SLR 14,500 for major irrigation
works. This translated into financial internal rates of return (FIRRs) of approximately 23 percent
and economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) of 27 percent for minor tank investments. For the
Giant’s Tank, FIRRs and EIRRs were estimated as in the region of 20-23 percent and 26-30 percent
respectively, depending on the phasing of benefits. No quantitative estimates for returns to other
primary benefit areas defined above were given.
The official name of the project was changed to the Community Livelihoods in Conflict Affected
Areas Project through an addendum to the development credit agreement dated 4 October 2007.
A First Additional Financing to the project, for the amount of USD 12, million became effective
on 22 February 2010 and provided additional resources to respond to the increasing rate of
resettlement of internally displaced persons following the termination of the civil conflict. No
significant changes were made in the nature of project activities, but interventions were expanded
into a further 135 communities and an estimated 100,000 displaced persons.
The Project Paper for the Second Additional Financing to the project, dated 4 May 2011, expanded
the initial analysis, and estimated FIRRs and EIRRs for irrigation works, livelihood activities and
community infrastructure investments (primarily roads, water supply and buildings). These ranged
                                                 57
Sri Lanka RaP ICRR                                          Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis


from 17 percent (community infrastructure) and 19 percent (livelihoods) to 25 percent (irrigation
works) in financial terms and 16-23 percent in economic terms. The returns to community
infrastructure were estimated based on time savings for water collection and calculations made
with respect to the Bank-funded Gemidiriya Project in 2009. Returns to livelihood activities drew
on models for selected small business and agricultural activities expected to be financed under the
project. Overall project returns were calculated at 20 percent (FIRR) and 18 percent (EIRR).The
Project Paper for the Third Additional Financing to the project, dated June 10 2011, used the same
projections as those given in the 2nd Additional Financing paper. No financial and economic
analysis of any sort was presented in the Restructuring Paper of 15 January 2012, which
represented the last formal modification to the project.

        B.      Post Investment Economic and Financial Analysis: Sub Components
Analytical Methods
Form of the analysis. The financial analysis is concerned with costs and returns expressed in
prices actually paid in commercial transactions and intends to show how benefits of higher
production translate into higher incomes for stakeholders. Normally an economic analysis would
estimate how the project has contributed to Sri Lanka’s economy, but as very little information is
available on the two key factors of relevance in this case – the shadow prices of labor and foreign
exchange - only limited discussion is provided here for economic returns.
The analysis of the Project is able to be more specific about the costs and benefits than was the
case at appraisal because sub-projects, investments and activities have been identified and
implemented throughout the project period. Regular recording and reporting of progress and the
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system have accumulated a very comprehensive set of data on
the activities, outcomes and impacts of the Project. The Project Management Unit (PMU) gathered
considerable information which was stored in an accessible data base and used to obtain mmuch
of the information about the scale and costs of activities and the number of beneficiaries. For some
areas (such as clusters and the characteristics of community-level loans), detailed data was
available from the M&E system on financial performance.
In addition, however, an extensive randomized but representative field survey was conducted in
late 2014 by ‘community resource persons’ (CRPs) in each target community who, following a
one year period of employment paid by RaP, have subsequently been funded entirely from
community resources; primarily from interest earned through the Livelihood Support loans which
were revolved within the communities. Using standard survey formats, a total of 715 CRPs
collected data on 1,857 sample investments distributed (according to the frequency of the
interventions) across a wide range of irrigation, roads, water supply, livelihoods and polynet
investments in the 12 districts where community-based interventions had occurred and therefore
CRPs were available. No survey was undertaken in the four additional districts included as a result
of the
Financial and economic analysis was not undertaken for roads and water supply investments,
although data was obtained on the number of beneficiaries as well as, in the case of water supplies,

                                                58
Sri Lanka RaP ICRR                                           Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis


for changes in production and labor saving as a result of the new service. For water supply
investments, an attempt was made in the survey to identify if there had been any change in the
health status of the beneficiaries, but the results were inconclusive. For irrigation and livelihood
activities, however, data was collected on investment amounts, operating costs (including family
and other unpaid labor) and gross returns (sales prices and quantities). No costs were attributed for
land, taxes or similar items.
Summaries of the survey results are provided in the Appendices to this Annex, and are referred to
in the relevant component and sub-component sections below. Total project expenditures for all
investment categories evaluated are provided in Appendix 1 to his Annex.

Component and Sub Component Analysis
Component 1: Village rehabilitation and development (US$53.14 million). This component
comprised: (a) reviving, forming and strengthening community-based organizations (CBOs); (b)
community-level subprojects for rehabilitation and improvements to essential village-level social
and economic infrastructure and facilities; (c) livelihood support activities for vulnerable groups
and people, and (d) special development activities targeting women, widows, land mine victims,
etc. The main beneficiaries were Internally Displaced People (IDPs) and other conflict-affected
households in about 600 selected focal villages in the 12 districts included in the project area.
Through additional financing, the number of villages was ultimately raised to 1,039.
This component aimed to contribute directly to creating an enabling environment in the selected
focal villages for quick socioeconomic recovery, through the restoration of productive village-
level assets, mobilization and strengthening of village-level community institutions, promotion of
production and employment, and the triggering of economic activities at the household and village
level. The project financed village subprojects, primarily civil works, and sub-grants, goods,
training and other services.
The PAD indicates that 1,000 sustainable CBOs - later modified to Village Development
Organizations (VDOs) - would be established and 24,000 ha of small-scale irrigation would be
rehabilitated.
The principal financial and economic benefits of the project derive from this component and the
results and returns to activities under this component analyzed below include:
   •   Small scale irrigation rehabilitation;
   •   Minor irrigation systems improvement and expansion;
   •   Rural access roads;
   •   Community water supply systems (including wells, tube wells and pumped systems), and;
   •   Livelihood support activities
It should be noted that all types of infrastructure have been analyzed in this Annex by category
(e.g. irrigation, roads, etc.). The following analyses therefore include investments formally
allocated under Components 2 (Major Irrigation Infrastructure) and 4 (Flood Damage
Rehabilitation) in order to more clearly identify the returns to each of these categories of
investments

Small Scale Irrigation Rehabilitation: A random, geographically stratified sample of 54 from a
total of 390 systems rehabilitated under this activity were surveyed in eight districts, representing
an investment of SLR 378 million of a total project investment in such systems of SLR 1,316
million (approximately USD 10.1 million at current rates of exchange).
The results are presented in summary format in Appendix 3 to Annex 5 (Beneficiary Survey
Results). In assessing operational costs, a value was assigned to unpaid labor, so the results are
returns after all labor costs have been included. Rates of return based upon the survey results vary
widely across different districts, but an average FIRR of 16 percent is calculated across the entire
sample. Although no predicted returns were calculated for small-scale irrigation rehabilitation, this
is considered low for rehabilitation investment where much of the infrastructure already exists. It
should be borne in mind, however, that many districts of Sri Lanka were subject to a severe drought
during the Yala season of 2104 when the survey was conducted, and thus water availability was
restricted in schemes within these areas. In Mannar District, for example, 10 of the 13 schemes
surveyed had no production at all during the Yala season, but still generated average returns of 26
percent.
In fact, as shown in Table 1 below, return calculations based upon M&E data, show much higher
rates of return for small-scale irrigation rehabilitation, reaching an NPV of SLR 1,906 million
(USD 14.6 million) and an FIRR of 73 percent. It is believed that this is the result of the project
M&E data taking years before the drought problems of 2013-14.
Expansion of Minor Schemes: Even lower rates of return were obtained from the survey in the
case of the minor schemes improvement and expansion activity. A sample of 64 from a total of
134 schemes were surveyed. Total project investment in this activity was SLR 645 million
(approximately USD 5 million) and the average FIRR was calculated at 13 percent. Again,
however, these results reflect the conditions in the field at the time of the survey and longer-term
data provided by the project M&E unit (Table 1) suggest much higher returns in earlier years –
averaging 65 percent. It should also be noted that returns to the minor schemes expansion program
are based only on incremental gains, as most were in operation at the time of investment, thus
accounting for the lower rate than obtained on small-scale rehabilitation.
Rural Access Roads: A sample of 442 road and related investments (culverts, bridges and
causeways) were surveyed from a total of 1,765 project investments in this category with an
extension of 2,683 km. Total project investment for this activity was almost USD 35 million, of
which 72 percent was accounted for by AF3 financing.
The surveyed sample accounted for 421 km of road (see Appendix 2) and field staff were asked to
determine the number of families and total population resident within 300m, and within 3 km of
the sample road. The larger distance accounted for 383,000 persons, or an average of just over 900
persons (239 families) living within a 3 km distance of each kilometer of road investment. Given
the investment costs of the road sections surveyed, it can be estimated that the total road investment
benefitted some 2.4 million persons or 641,000 families (this exceeds the project estimate of
641,000 households). No attempt was made to impute financial returns to these beneficiaries.

Water Supply: A total of 1,316 water supply investments were financed through the project at a
total cost of USD 2.7 million, benefitting an estimated 49,736 households. These investments
included well rehabilitation as well as the construction of wells, tube wells and the installation of
pumped supply systems. A sample of 238 of these investments were surveyed in 12 districts (see
Appendix 3).
Based upon survey data, the average cost per beneficiary was SLR 3,090 (USD 23.60). The
average time required for water collection prior to the investments was estimated by respondents
at 33 minutes, although this varied from an average of 55 minutes in Moneragala to only 7 minutes
in Trincomalee. After the investment, almost all respondents reported that water was now ‘close’.
This analysis has not attempted to quantify the financial value of this time saved.
Respondents were asked about increases in dry season water use, the number of livestock held and
the area of household land cultivated following the installation of the water supply. Water use
increased in all cases, ranging from 36 to 197 percent, but averaging 94 percent across the entire
sample. For livestock, increases were from 29 to 220 percent, with an average increase in numbers
of 81 percent. Changes in cultivated area produced the most diverse responses, ranging from 38 to
3,859 percent (in Jaffna). It is likely that many households did not cultivate household land in
Jaffna and similar districts prior to the availability of a water supply. It is worth noting that in
Jaffna, extensive use was made of municipal water supplies, providing relatively unconstrained
access to water after system installation.
Livelihood Support Activities: Including polynet greenhouses (which were funded directly by
the project on a grant basis to test and demonstrate the technology), a total of 123,612 investments
were made in LSA activities at a total disbursed amount of SLR 1.7 billion (USD 13 million).
Approximately 60 percent of these investments were made with funds which had revolved through
the VDO. The vast majority of these investments were made through VDO credit committee
managed loans at 12 percent interest per annum, using small groups of at least five embers each to
guarantee the member receiving the loan. These small groups in turn were encouraged to establish
their own savings programs which were then lent to members to meet emergency needs for such
items as medicines, education expenses and similar.
Appendix 4 to this Annex summarizes the financial returns to LSA and polynet investments as
determined by the field survey conducted as part of the ICR. For agricultural, fisheries and small
industry investments, earnings net of operating and labor costs5 exceeded total investment costs
by the end of the first year of operation in all cases, and averaged 300, 434 and 348 percent of
initial investment respectively. In a number of cases, they achieved in excess of 500 percent returns
in a single year. For livestock and small business investments, returns were generally lower, but
still averaged net earnings of 193 and 169 percent of investment costs respectively in one year of
operation. Interest free loans, given by some VDOs to the poorest wealth ranking households in
their communities, also generated strong net returns.

The only LSA category in which financial performance was relatively disappointing was for the
pilot polynet greenhouse program. A total of four different designs of polynet houses were offered
over the period from 2011 to 2014 following problems with the initial design which was high cost
and reportedly unstable in high winds. Net annual returns to the 96 surveyed polynet houses
averaged only 48 percent, and one surveyed district (Vavuniya) reported an average loss across
the 12 samples. As these structures were provided as grants, this signifies that in these cases the
owners were unable to even cover their operating expenses. It is relevant that growers were not
familiar with the intensive production techniques required for efficient polynet usage (although
training was provided to all recipients) and some owners stated that, as they had received their
polynets free of charge, they felt obliged to supply output at no cost to their neighbors, which may
have negatively affected their returns. Although some additional polynet houses are reported to
have been purchased by individuals using LSA loan funds, the number is small, suggesting that
the technology may not have been appropriate for conflict-affected communities.

Repayment rates on LSA loans over the period 2011-2014 averaged approximately 87 percent,
although, as shown in the graph below, these rates were significantly affected in 2012 and 2013
by the effects of both flooding and drought, particularly in the districts of Vavuniya and Mullaitivu.
While repayment rates below 95 percent would be generally unacceptable for a microfinance
organization, rendering it unsustainable in the long term, it is important to bear in mind that the
creation of such institutions was not one of the objectives of the project. Rather, the LSA funds
were intended to facilitate and enable the creation of new livelihoods and secondarily to empower
target communities through the management and control of their own financial resources. Given

the strong financial returns to the surveyed LSA investment and the ability of all VDOs to revolve
the funds over a period of years, this was clearly achieved.
Component 2: Essential rehabilitation and improvements to selected major irrigation schemes
(US$16.74 million). This component included essential dam safety repairs and improvements, and
urgent rehabilitation/improvements to major irrigation, drainage, and conveyance/feeder canals of
selected major irrigation/drainage schemes. This component aimed to benefit approximately
15,000 farming families who were dependent on these schemes for their livelihoods by: (a)
preventing potential risk of failure of the most dilapidated five major irrigation schemes (later
increased to nine); (b) improving serviceability, performance and improved water availability; and
(c) restoring and enhancing agricultural production. The component financed civil and
electromechanical works, goods and equipment, consultancy services and training activities.
As part of the field survey, sample survey data was collected for all categories of irrigation
investment, including major scheme rehabilitation, across two cultivation seasons from a group of
randomly selected beneficiaries. Data included: investment costs, areas cultivated before and after
rehabilitation; number of beneficiaries; production and labor costs; yields, and; prices. Survey-
based estimates of major schemes are given in Appendix 1, while net incomes for yields and net
income before and after investment are shown in Table 4 in the main text.
The scheme in Batticaloa had no functioning irrigated area prior to the rehabilitation and expanded
to 1,000 acres across the two seasons once work was completed. As a result, the calculated FIRR
is 93 percent, a very high level (see Appendix 1). Although there were 280 acres of existing
irrigated cultivation at the second scheme in Vavuniya, this expanded after investment to 600
acres; an increase of 114 percent. Combined with a much lower cost of rehabilitation works than
was the case in Batticaloa, this expansion resulted in an FIRR of 57 percent.
Overall returns to irrigation investments – including those covered under Component 1 above -
were calculated based on field survey data and project M&E data. The incremental area under
irrigation derives from the project database. It can be seen in Table 1 that returns to investment
based on project data are very high, totaling 114 percent across all irrigation investment. This is
largely due to the fact that most expenditures relate to rehabilitation of existing infrastructure, but
it should be noted that the use of this data yields much higher rates than the 2014 survey data
(when drought was a major problem).

Component 3: Community Livelihoods and Cluster Development Component ($4.35 million).
This component was revised in 2007 to move away from its initial focus on establishing farmer
organizations and towards improving agricultural support services to promote and support:
   •   At least four business linkages created for cluster commercial enterprises with private
       and/or public organizations.
   •   An increased volume of annual turnover of village/cluster organizations.
   •   Increased output of high quality village products (farm and non-farm) with at least 80%
       sold to domestic and international markets.
   •   Higher and/or stable prices for major village products for at least 80% of villages.
For the purposes of financial and economic analysis, the key element of this component was
support to ‘cluster’ organizations. Clusters could be formed from within the membership of a
single VDO, or from members of two or more neighboring VDOs. They received grant funds to
enable them to initiate small businesses or agricultural operations and the initial investment could
surpass SLR 6 million, although most investments did not exceed SLR 0.5 million. Appendix 6
summarizes the performance of 34 of the 50 clusters for which final performance data is available.
A further 19 Family Economic Enhancement Packages (FEEPS) were provided grant funds for
economic activities in a similar manner to the clusters, but only female-headed households could
be recipients.
The returns to investment in clusters varied widely, although many have been in operation for little
more than a single year, so caution is needed in interpreting the financial results. Only one cluster
registered negative financial returns, but a further 16 show FIRRs of less than 12 percent. Thus,
half of the clusters analyzed did not perform adequately. However, with an overall rate of return
for the entire group of 17 percent, average performance is adequate.
Component 4: Flood Damage Rehabilitation (USD 44.85 million)
Under this component, emergency funds were provided through an additional financing to finance
urgent repairs to irrigation, roads and water supply infrastructure. The majority of the funds, USD
29.6 million, was allocated to road repair, with small-scale irrigation infrastructure repair
accounting for USD 11.84 million.

            C.       Post Investment Economic and Financial Analysis: Whole Project

Financial Analysis
Financial analysis is intended to show how the costs and returns of those affected, as experienced
in their investments and commercial transactions, vary as a result of a project. The analysis was
undertaken only for those activities for which financial returns can be readily identified; irrigation
(small-scale rehabilitation, minor expansion and large), Livelihood Support Activities (LSAs) and
Clusters. When financial benefits were assessed for these activities against total project costs an
FIRR of 14.6 percent and an NPV of SLR 2,354 million (USD 18 million) were generated.
While the FIRR may appear only marginally positive against the discount factor of 12 percent
typically applied for NPV calculations, it is important to consider that these financial benefits relate
to only a minority of the activities undertaken under the project, excluding returns to drinking
water supply, roads, community infrastructure and training for which financial returns are difficult
to quantify. Although benefits from these latter activities are not quantified, it is clear from
interviews with project participants that they were essential pre-conditions for the income
generating activities analyzed.
An indication of total project impact can be drawn from the number of beneficiary households that
can be identified as a result of the project. As shown in Figure 1 below, an estimated 222,555
households benefitted from project-financed livelihood activities, while Table 2 presents estimates
of 1.16 million households that benefitted from non-income generating investments, according to
the project database6.

    It should be noted, however, that many beneficiaries are likely to be included in more than one category, so a
    significant degree of double counting is likely.

Another indicator of project impact can be drawn from the employment created as a result of
project investments. Using data from the survey undertaken as part of the ICR, it can be estimated
that the income generating activities financed through the project resulted in over 40,000 additional
person years of employment per annum, the vast majority arising from the 123,612 Livelihood

Support Activities funded through VDOs. All of the employment under these activities was new,
in contrast to the irrigation employment which was generally incremental to existing activities and
labor use, except where irrigation systems had ceased to function entirely prior to rehabilitation.
Other activities, such as road and water supply construction and rehabilitation, will also have
generated temporary employment, but are not counted in this table.

Economic Analysis
The objective of economic analysis is to assess the impact of the project activities on the economy
as a whole. To achieve this, market prices (as used in the financial analysis) are adjusted to reflect
the cost of the assets and value of the generated products to account for such factors as
overvaluation of the currency, the opportunity cost of labor, and import and other taxes. These
adjusted prices are often referred to as ‘shadow prices’ but no shadow prices are maintained by
World Bank for Sri Lanka.
However, rural labor prices are typically considerably higher than their opportunity cost, given
the limited alternative employment opportunities in these areas. Labor costs of income generating
activities (often unpaid and calculated in the financial analysis at market prices) average 43 percent
of total costs for LSA budgets, while the most recent estimates available from the Sri Lanka
Department of Agriculture for rice production put labor at approximately 50 percent of total costs.
Labor costs have therefore been adjusted downwards in the economic analysis by a conservative
factor of 20 percent for these portions of costs.
The real effective exchange rates (REER) provides an estimate of any over or under-valuation
of the currency in question. The World Bank, which monitors and publishes REERs, does not
provide data for Sri Lanka, but a recent analysis by a Colombo-based private sector firm7indicates
an REER of 103.3 in September 2014 and an average REER since 2012 close to 100. This suggests

that the Sri Lankan Rupee has been valued at close to parity over recent years, and no adjustment
in the costs of foreign exchange items is therefore needed.
The principal product generated as a result of investments made by the project is rice. Almost all
irrigated cultivation is comprised of rice, while survey data for SLA activities indicates that
approximately 45 percent of returns result from rice production. To establish the economic benefits
from this production, it is necessary to consider the import parity price of rice. As of 2014, GOSL
maintained both import duties (SLR 20/kg) and a Special Levy (SLR 5/kg) on rice imports, which
suggests a significant degree of protection for domestic output, which accounts for 95 percent of
total national consumption. With international rice prices reported at SLR 53.9/kg (Thai 5%
broken) in January 2015, and assuming transport costs at a minimum of 5 percent, delivered rice
to Sri Lanka would cost SLR 56.6/kg. Import duties further raise this cost to an import parity price
of SLR 81.6/kg. Reported retail prices for milled white rice in Sri Lanka average SLR 76/kg,
suggesting an overvaluing of rice prices on the domestic market of at least 7 percent, although
distribution costs from the port to retail would raise this to in the region of 10 percent. For the
economic analysis, therefore, net returns for all irrigation activities are reduced by 10 percent,
while those for SLA activities are reduced by 5 percent.
With lower labor costs completely balanced out by lower rice net earnings for irrigation schemes,
and partially offset in the case of SLA incomes, the EIRR for the project is only slightly different
from that obtained in the financial analysis, increasing by only one tenth of a percent (see Table
4).

Conclusions
While both the financial and economic rates of return calculated in the analysis do not exceed 15
percent, these returns are considered satisfactory given the following factors:
   •   The project was conducted largely during a period of severe civil conflict, involving
       massive dislocations of project populations and, in many cases, the loss of most or all assets
       previously held by the internally displaced persons;
   •   The financial and economic analyses were conducted only with respect to those
       investments yielding financially quantifiable benefits; these amounted to no more than 30
       percent of total investment costs;
   •   Substantial additional benefits were generated by the project with respect to employment;
       an estimated 41,000 person years of labor per annum resulted from the irrigation, cluster
       and SLA investments. Additional short term employment generated by infrastructure
       construction was not quantified;
                                                  68

   •   While it is difficult to provide a firm estimate of the total number of beneficiaries due to
       double counting (e.g. many SLA beneficiaries may also have benefitted from rural roads
       and water supply provision under the project), it is likely that more than 500,000
       households derived direct benefits from the project;
   •   The establishment and operation of Village Development Organizations (VDOs) in more
       than 800 communities, combined with the assessment of 70 percent of these VDOs being
       sustainable (categories A or B), indicates that considerable social capital was created in the
       course of implementation. With regard to sustainability of these achievements, it is worth
       noting that the salaries of the Community Resource Persons (CRPs) leading each VDO
       were paid by the project only for the first year; after that they were paid entirely from
       community resources (interest on SLA loans).

                            Annex 5: Beneficiary Survey Results


Introduction
As part of the investment completion and results report process, a random, stratified survey of
project beneficiaries was undertaken in the 12 districts in which village level operations had
occurred. The survey was administered by the 715 Community Resource Persons (CRPs)
employed in target communities in these districts. The survey, designed by the ICRR team,
occurred over the period of August and September 2014 and involved a total of 1,857 survey points
or an average of 2.6 interviews per CRP (see Appendix 1 to this Annex). The distribution of the
survey respondents was selected according to the number of investments made per category (roads,
irrigation schemes, livelihood support loans etc.) overall and per district.
The survey covered four broad categories of project intervention: irrigation, roads, water supply
and livelihood support. Within each broad category, a number of sub-categories were defined (see
Appendix 1) and the sample selection process reflected the frequency of each sub-category of
investment. The number of project supported clusters was small enough (54) that the M&E unit of
the project had tracked the results from all clusters and hence no results survey was required.
Given the difficulties in determining financial and economic benefits accruing to road and water
supply investments, the questionnaires for these categories focused more on the identification of
beneficiary numbers. In the case of water supply, the survey also attempted to determine changes
in the time required for water collection after the investment occurred, and any changes in the
pattern of activities within the affected households which occurred as a result (e.g. volume of water
used, area of household or small-scale crops grown, number of livestock kept, etc.), as well as
observed changes in household member health.
The survey forms were translated by the PMU from English into Singhalese and Tamil for
application in the field, and the results obtained were compiled by the M&E unit within the PMU
according to formats also supplied by the ICCR team.
Results of the Survey
Due to the volume of data generated by the nearly 2,000 respondents surveyed, only summary
tables are presented in the following sections. Complete survey results in electronic format are
available from the World Bank office in Colombo.

Irrigation
For irrigation a total of 122 samples were drawn from eight districts and the CRPs provided with
a translation of the survey form shown in Appendix 2. Three types of irrigation investment were
investigated – the rehabilitation of small-scale schemes, participation in a GOSL program for the
expansion of minor schemes entitled 2000 MIS and repair work on large-scale schemes following
the catastrophic floods on 2010. Respondents were asked about both production, revenues and
                                                 82

costs (including labor) for both Maha and Yala seasons, but in some districts the severe drought
that occurred in the 2013/2014 crop year meant that no cropping took place in the latter season.
Survey results are summarized in Appendix 3. Average annual returns to irrigation investment
ranged from 13 percent for those schemes under the 2000 MIS program to 16 percent for small-
scale rehabilitation and the repair of large-scale schemes. It should be noted that these returns
should be considered minimum levels, as the drought in the sample year resulted in several districts
being unable to provide water for irrigation in the subsidiary (Yala) season.

Roads
Two types of road investment were assessed; upgrading and repair of roads themselves, and the
construction and rehabilitation of bridges and culverts. In total, 442 samples were drawn of which
428 yielded usable data (see Appendix 4). A total of 303 of the structures were roads (mostly
gravel or concrete).
No attempt was made to determine the financial impact of road or culvert/bridge construction but
survey staff identified the number of households living with 300m and 3 km of the works. Just
over 100,000 households and nearly 400,000 persons lived within 3 km of the roads, averaging 59
households/km within 300m of the road and 234 households/km within 3km of the road.

Water Supply
A total of 285 water supply schemes were surveyed, involving interviews with nearly 2,500
families. Water supply systems installed under the project comprised dug wells, tube wells and
pumped village supply schemes, the most common being dug wells. In addition, some well
cleaning and repair was also undertaken.
Based upon the survey data, the average cost of water provision per beneficiary was SLR 3,090
(USD 23.60). Respondents estimated the average time required for water collection prior to the
investments at 33 minutes, although this varied from an average of 55 minutes in Moneragala to
only 7 minutes in Trincomalee. After the investment, almost all respondents reported that water
was now ‘close’. The survey did not attempt to quantify the financial value of this time saved.
Respondents were asked about increases in dry season water use, the number of livestock held and
the area of household land cultivated following the installation of the water supply. Water use
increased in all cases, ranging from 36 to 197 percent, but averaging 94 percent across the entire
sample. For livestock, increases were from 29 to 220 percent, with an average increase in numbers
of 81 percent. Changes in cultivated area produced the most diverse responses, ranging from 38 to
3,859 percent (in Jaffna). It is likely that many households did not cultivate household land in
Jaffna and similar districts prior to the availability of a water supply. It is worth noting that in
Jaffna, extensive use was made of municipal water supplies, providing relatively unconstrained
access to water after system installation.

Livelihood Support Activities
Including polynet greenhouses (which were funded directly by the project on a grant basis to test
and demonstrate the technology), a total of 123,612 investments were made in LSA activities at a
total disbursed amount of SLR 1.7 billion (USD 13 million). Approximately 60 percent of these
investments were made with funds that had revolved through the VDO.
The survey drew a sample of 1,007 investments and the survey data collection form required the
identification of the total investment made, production volumes and values and costs, including
unpaid labor (see Appendix 6).
Results of the survey are summarized in Appendix 7. For agricultural, fisheries and small industry
investments, earnings net of operating and labor costs exceeded total investment costs by the end
of the first year of operation in all cases, and averaged 300, 434 and 348 percent of initial
investment respectively. In a number of cases, they achieved in excess of 500 percent returns in a
single year. For livestock and small business investments, returns were generally lower, but still
averaged net earnings of 193 and 169 percent of investment costs respectively in one year of
operation. Interest free loans, given by some VDOs to the poorest wealth ranking households in
their communities, also generated strong net returns.
The only LSA category in which financial performance was relatively disappointing was for the
pilot polynet greenhouse program. A total of four different designs of polynet houses were offered
over the period from 2011 to 2014 following problems with the initial design which was high cost
and reportedly unstable in high winds. Net annual returns to the 96 surveyed polynet houses
averaged only 48 percent, and one surveyed district (Vavuniya) reported an average loss across
the 12 samples. As these structures were provided as grants, this signifies that in these cases the
owners were unable to cover even their operating expenses. It is relevant that growers were not
familiar with the intensive production techniques required for efficient polynet usage (although
training was provided to all recipients) and some owners stated that, as they had received their
polynets free of charge, they felt obliged to supply output at no cost to their neighbors, which may
have negatively affected their returns. Although some additional polynet houses are reported to
have been purchased by individuals using LSA loan funds, the number is small, suggesting that
the technology may not have been appropriate for conflict-affected communities.

          Independent Impact Assessment and Focus Group Discussion Report

Given the complex origins of the RaP Project, the resettlement aspects of the Project needs to
be assessed within the context of the preceding, and subsequent Projects that were implemented
in the North and East of the Country. This section provides a brief overview of the key Projects
implemented with regard to resettlement of conflict affected persons.

The North-East Irrigated Agriculture Project (NEIAP) which was initiated in 2000, was
designed to generate positive impacts to internally displaced people (IDPs) by facilitating:
Increased agriculture productivity and production, Increased service capacity at village level,
Employment generation for resettled families and Community infrastructure facilities for
conflict affected communities in the North-East and adjoining project areas; while providing
assistance to 55,000 beneficiary families for sustainable social and economic reintegration.
NEIAP II initiated in 2005, was the successor to NEIAP. The Project development objective
was mainly to help conflict affected communities in the North-East Province and adjoining
areas to re-establish production and basic community services. The project objectives were to
be realized by providing assistance to identified project beneficiaries, to jump start agricultural
and small-scale reconstruction activities, as well as build their capacity for sustainable social
and economic reintegration through the project. The NEIAP II Project was re-structured in
July 2007 and renamed “Community Livelihood in Conflict Affected Areas Project (Re-
Awakening Project –RaP), primarily for two reasons:
   1) The escalation of violence had made it difficult to implement large scale infrastructure
      projects in conflict affected areas.
   2) Community demand for immediate livelihood support had increased, which required a
      more flexible staffing arrangements with a greater emphasis on skill development and
      accountability at the community level for project management and facilitation.

The objective of the Project (RaP) was the same as NEAIP II, however the implementation
strategy was changed to facilitate the Community Driven Development Approach through
VDOs (instead of Community Based Organizations).
In December 2009, an Emergency Additional Financing was approved by the World
Bank’s Board to scale-up the components for village development and rehabilitation of
irrigation schemes, specifically focusing on the returning Internally Displaced Persons
(IDPs) who had been displaced in 2009 in the Northern Province. The entire project
maintained its activities in twelve districts in the Eastern and Northern Provinces and adjoining
areas and was designed to assist about 136,000 households in 1000 villages and to rehabilitate
seven major irrigation schemes benefiting over 35,000 farmers.
Following the request of GOSL, World Bank proposed a 3rd Additional Financing Credit
for Community Livelihood in Conflict Affected Areas Project (RaP) in June 2011,
including four additional districts affected by the floods in 2010-2011. The revised project
development objective was amended as “Help conflict- and/or flood-affected communities and
villages in North, East and the adjoining areas by restoring their livelihoods, enhancing
                                                86
Sri Lanka RaP ICRR                                 Annex 6: Independent Impact Assessment


agricultural production and incomes, and building their capacity for sustainable social and
economic reintegration”.
With the experience gained from carrying out the above discussed projects, immediately after
end of the Civil Conflict in May 2009, GOSL negotiated with IDA (November 2009) to
implement the Emergency Northern Recovery Project (ENReP), which came into effect in
February 2010 with the IDA credit funds. The ENReP supported internally displaced people
(IDP) in the Northern Province to restore socio economic activities that had been destroyed
over the last 30 years of civil conflict. The ENReP supported IDPs through three project
components that were mainly focused on resettling IDPs in their place of origin in the Northern
Province.
Long term Project Sustainability
Social Integration under RaP Project
   - The VDO structure provided the flexibility for beneficiaries to take decisions according
        to their own priorities. This framework enabled the village community to help needy
        people within their own community, and greatly helped facilitate social reintegration.

   -   The Project also identified vulnerable people and provided financial assistance to
       commence income generating activities. From the VDO and cluster surveys it was
       evident that persons with disabilities, disadvantaged youths (unemployed), women
       headed families, widows, internally displaced people, Ex-combatants, elders and
       economically active people had participated in the LSA activity of the Project. In all
       the categories, female participation rate in the VDO’s was higher than the males in all
       groups. (pg 76 of Impact Assessment Report)

   -   Furthermore the Project also provided interest free loans for vulnerable groups in the
       village. CRPs played a major role in the village. According to the survey findings, the
       highest membership in the VDO’s are reported among persons with disabilities (13%
       males and 19% females), women headed households (36%), Widows (1% male and
       39% females), internally displaced persons (26% males and 27% females), and ex-
       combatants (11% males and 12% females). On an average of over 80% of the categories
       of Widows (80%), ex-combatants (93%), economically active persons (92%), and other
       categories (96%) have obtained finances from the Village Development Organization.
       (Table 2 - Annex 1b)

   -   Women empowerment and gender mainstreaming has been a critical feature of the RaP
       project. Recognizing the critical role women play in managing household economies
       and generating family incomes as key, the Project was designed to target women
       beneficiaries. The project facilitated financial assistance to women in particular, so as
       to enable them to gain self-employment and earn independent incomes which
       subsequently helped them to contribute towards their households. This economic
       independence empowered many women, to take charge and initiatives with regards to
       their families and communities. According to the survey findings, 21% of the sample
       population is members of the VDO (7% are males and 14% are females). According to
       the VDOs, 74% of its membership has provided financing and loans for livelihood
       activities. 62% of these beneficiaries are males and 80% are females. These
       findings indicate that the participation and engagement of women in both community

       decision making roles (through VDOs) and as project beneficiaries is substantially
       higher than that of males.

Risks to Operation & Maintenance of Infrastructure Projects

   -   There have been some deficiencies in the quality of construction particularly during the
       first year works due to a lack of capacity and quality testing facilities in the conflict-
       affected area; especially in the Northern Province. A large majority of VDOs have
       successfully completed most of the civil works awarded to them. Most VDOs have
       established working relationships and social integration with the concerned government
       agencies.

   -   The O&M subcommittee has the responsibility to strengthen the VDO financially and
       establish a common fund for O&M. Without any external funding it will be difficult for
       VDOs to carryout O&M activities for the assets created by the Project.

   -   VDOs need further technical training to sustain project-created assets and infrastructure
       facilities. Furthermore, the project has not taken any action to develop Para
       Professionals (i.e. Village Level Technical Assistants) for long term sustainability of
       community infrastructures facilities (i.e. Village Roads, Water Projects etc.)

   -   It is the policy of the Government that FOs are responsible for routine O&M of the
       minor irrigation works, and the Department of Agrarian Services and Provincial
       Irrigation Department provide the technical guidance and financial support to FOs to
       undertake large scale repairs to irrigation tanks that are beyond FOs' technical and
       financial capacity. Moreover, it is the common practice that FO members clean the
       canals and canal embankments and attend to urgent small repairs using voluntary labor
       before the onset of each cultivation season, twice a year. This practice is likely to
       continue in the future. The following table shows the expressions of the VDOs with
       regard to O&M of the assets created by the Project. (Table 4 Annex 5)

   -   As far as the major irrigation schemes are concerned there is no identifiable risk
       involved as they are maintained by the respective custodian departments.

   -   Most of the assets rehabilitated under FDR (except village roads) have been handed
       over to respective departments and will be maintained by them. The community is
       supposed to maintain only the village roads. (FDR Rehab of rural infrastructure)

VDO Status after Project Completion - Financial

   -   Most of the VDOs have generated considerable savings through the execution of
       community contracts, and from interest accumulated from loans in the case of LSA,
       and have opened up separate bank accounts. They are aware and willing to take care of
       the tanks, roads, community water projects and community buildings. The savings-led
       funds inculcated necessary financial capacity to undertake routine O&M activities that
       require more than voluntary labor as a durable solution for the maintenance of
       community infrastructure facilities. However, these savings may be soon depleted in
                                              88

       those CBOs which do not have systems of membership and service fee collection
       systems. Refer section 2.3 of Annex 1B

   -   Loan recovery rate is about 95% and majority of beneficiaries obtained a second round
       of loan from revolving funds. The status of repayment of loans obtained from the VDOs
       is given below.
           o 25% fully repaid the loans
           o 56% continue to pay without any defaults
           o 14% have gone into arrears but continue to pay
           o 5% have gone into arrears, but attempt to settle the loan

       As a result of the strength of VDOs and discipline among the members, they are
       managing revolving funds without any constraints. However, some VDO members
       have not taken steps to re settle revolving fund loans due to a lack of responsibility and
       lack of screening process of the selection for LSA loan by VDOs. The main reason for
       this lapse is the lack of legal status for VDOs. This has an effect on the long term
       sustainability of the VDOs. The entire system works on the group guarantee and the
       social pressure from the group members is the existing mechanism to ensure repayment
       of loans. This system will also ensure strengthening of social integration. A small
       percentage of defaulters in the loan schemes is unavoidable. The sustainability of the
       VDO’s financial status will be in question when the percentage of defaulters are high.

   -   The VDOs adopted the group lending mechanism where no collateral was necessary.
       The pressure by the other members in the groups ensure the repayment of the loan on
       time. The project has given 53,356 loan from the project fund and it has been revolved
       into 130,621 loans for the beneficiaries. This figure is more than 200 percent indicating
       its operational efficiency. These loans have greatly benefited 91% of the beneficiaries.
       The loans have been invested in agriculture, animal husbandry, fisheries, business
       development, skill development and small industries to enhance the family income. The
       household survey indicated the following impacts of the utilization of finances/loans
       obtained from VDOs which is an indication of the effectiveness of the loans provided.
            o 96% said their level of income had increased
            o 90% said their family lifestyle had improved
            o 90% said their children’s education had improved
            o 91% said their economic status had improved
            o 90% said their social status had improved.

   -   Most of VDOs in the study sample are not in a position to self-sustain the project
       approach without having external support, and cannot independently handle the
       development activities when the services of the project are withdrawn. Capacity
       building and guidance are needed especially in the context of social and political
       pressure being developed in the field just after the termination of project. Further, most
       of the office bearers of VDO are new and they need Government assistance in terms of
       coordination, monitoring and regulation of their functions and operations to play their
       role as a village level institution.

   -   Linkages among project component is another success factor for project sustainability.
       The Irrigation component, livelihood component, cluster development activities are
       interrelated. The interrelationship among these components are a key element for the
       project sustainability. At the project design stage, project outcomes were designed
       based on a holistic consideration of all project components.


VDO Status after Project Completion – Organizational

   -   The maintenance plan for the assets created by the project has not yet been finalized.
       The sustainability of the VDOs depends on the continuous functioning of CRPs and
       their accountability to the existing Government administrative mechanism. Currently
       there is a proposed system of registering VDOs under the Social Service Act which has
       some form of legal cover under the Divisional Secretariat. But many of the members
       felt that they cannot function independently as they do now. According to the evaluation
       findings, there is a strong sentiment among the VDOs to continue as they are now but
       there is no objection to having a supervisory mechanism above them. They also
       indicated their preference of exploring the possibility of functioning under the
       cooperative system. There is another possibility of accommodating the VDO as a
       special rural development unit under the provincial council which must be explored
       further.

   -   The high level of beneficiary participation of RaP Project components indicates
       community interest in participating in the village level decision making process. From
       the beginning of the project, VDOs were formed and CRPs appointed for process
       continuation. From the planning stage to the completion stage, CRPs have been
       involved in village-level rehabilitation activities and livelihood development activities.
       In December 2014 when the project terminated its services, the respective VDOs had
       taken this responsibility to pay particular allowance. This is a good indicator for long
       term sustainability of the VDO model.

   -   It is suggested that a study must be conducted to evolve a better mechanism within the
       existing legal framework and institutional arrangements without losing the flexible and
       adaptive aspects that have been cultivated in the VDO’s by RaP.

   -   The VDO model introduced through the RaP project will be very effective in
       implementing any such projects in the future. As VDO members now have the capacity
       and capability to carry out similar development activities and functions established
       through the RaP Project. The VDO model has effectively set up the social infrastructure
       required to carry out future development work, provided they are given the technical
       and financial support to function over the long term.

Special Features of RAP Project

Women empowerment and Gender mainstreaming under Project

Women empowerment and gender mainstreaming has been a critical feature of the RaP project.
The Project initiated several activities targeting women as direct beneficiaries. Some of the key
mechanisms through which women were direct beneficiaries were through the:
   •   Family Economic Enhancement Program which provided assistance for war widows
   •   Livelihood support services under Component 1 which offered direct livelihood
       support assistance including project loans and entrepreneur development opportunities
   •   Capacity building program under component 1, which offered training and skill
       development.
   •   VDO and CRP model which offered employment opportunities as CRPs through the
       VDO model,
   •   Interest free loans for vulnerable groups – which offered loans to women headed
       households, disabled persons and widows


When evaluating the project achievements against results framework, it was anticipated that
there would be 360,000 women beneficiaries due to project intervention. At the end of the
project however, 418,835 women had benefited from the project. Therefore, the overall
progress in this aspect is 116%.
The impacts via these different mechanisms are briefly discussed below:
Impact of Family Economic Enhancement Program: The Family Economic Enhancement
Program (FEEP) was introduced in the first quarter of 2013. This program was designed to
help enhance the economic condition of many women-headed households – which had become
a prevalent socio-economic feature in post conflict areas.
The beneficiaries of this program were primarily young widows, and financial assistance to
them was provided through 100% grants, with the objective of enhancing economic conditions.
These grants were structured to provide Rs. 10,000 as fixed deposits and Rs. 40,000 to develop
livelihoods such as Poultry, Cattle Farming, small business etc. Of the remaining funds, Rs
4000 was given to purchase kitchen utensils and another Rs 6,000 was given to engage in
subsistent agriculture to support the long-term economic and environmental benefits to the
households and project village. Under this program, many women headed families showed
great interest in initiating market oriented economic activities to support their families.
Livelihood support services: 75% of VDO members had obtained the finance from LSA fund.
As a result 53% of village Households directly benefitted from LSA loans of which a majority
of them were women. The project facilitated financial assistance to women in particular, so as
to enable them to gain self-employment and earn independent incomes which subsequently
helped them to contribute towards their households. This economic independence empowered
many women to take charge, and provided initiatives with regards to their families and
communities. Women’s groups were further strengthened through small group livelihood
support programmes.
                                               91
Sri Lanka RaP ICRR                                    Annex 6: Independent Impact Assessment



Capacity building program: One of the key areas through which women have benefitted from
the RaP project is through the capacity building programs offered through Component 1 of the
Project. These programs not only developed skills and developed overall capacity but also
contributed in enhancing women’s leadership qualities; which has shown significant improved
over the last five years as a result of the project interventions. Therefor it can be concluded that
as a result of the project interventions, women have been taking a more active role in the family
decision making process. They have access and control of economic resources such as family
income, family saving, home ownership, ownership of land, and are involved in various
household financial decisions such as preparing household budgets, and actively managing
small businesses.

The VDO and CRP model: this model was a very successful model in directly engaging
women in the Project activities. According to the survey findings, 21% of the sample
population were VDO members of which most were women (annex 1a for details). Through
this model, 74% of VDO members received financing and loans for livelihood activities; of
those members who received financing through the VDOs, 80% were females. These findings
indicate that the participation and engagement of women in both community decision making
roles (through VDOs) and as project beneficiaries is substantially higher than that of males.
Interest free loans for vulnerable groups: These types of loans specifically targeted
vulnerable groups in the project areas, including persons with disabilities (13% males and 19%
females), widows (1% Male and 39% females), women headed households, internally
displaced persons (26% males and 27% females), and ex-combatants (11% males and 12%
females). In each of these categories the number of women beneficiaries were substantially
higher than that of men. (annex 1a). According to the survey findings it was revealed that on
average of over 80% of Widows, 93% of Ex-combatants, 92% economically active persons
have obtained finances from the Village Development Organizations.
Poly-Tunnel cum net houses for agriculture was provided under Component 1: Village
rehabilitation and Development, in order to support livelihood restoration in project areas. The
Initial target for the poly-net house program was to set up 3000 poly-net houses, but later this
target was revised to 1230.The Project planned to distribute 1230 poly tunnel net houses and
at the end of the period, the project was able to distribute 1229 poly tunnel net houses and
achieve almost 100% of the project target. However, there were some key shortcomings
identified, that hampered the overall progress and success of this project intervention. Some of
the key shortcomings identified are highlighted below:

   1. One of the main reasons for the high failure rate of the polynet houses was the selection
      criteria used to disperse polynet houses; where farmers without prior experience in this
      regard were chosen
   2. Some beneficiaries did not properly handle their poly tunnel net houses. Indicating that
      farmers lacked awareness on the proper maintenance of this technology. Farmers also
      lacked a basic understanding of the value of such poly net houses. As a result there were
      instances where these polynet houses were used for storing firewood and other
      incompatible activities.
                                                92
Sri Lanka RaP ICRR                                  Annex 6: Independent Impact Assessment


   3. Another significant shortcoming observed was that even though polynet houses were
      designed to house high value crops to minimize pest attacks, in some instances farmers
      had utilized these polynet houses to cultivate dry zone vegetables – which were
      incompatible with the newly created micro climates in the polynet houses. In those
      instances the polynet houses were failures which could have been avoided with greater
      awareness.
   4. Monitoring of the progress of polynet houses was also lacking throughout the Project.
      A proper monitoring scheme would have helped prevent the high failure rate reported.
   5. Although poly net houses were abundant in some areas, some farmers, particularly in
      the dry zones were not interested in cultivating under the poly net houses

Despite the shortcomings in this regard however, this element of the project was still successful
in generating positive project impacts, including; enhancing family economic condition by
enabling farmers to cultivate high value crops within small land plots, positively impacting
national food security, enabling farmers to adapt to new agricultural technologies and
generating significant increase in productivity.
Impact of Water Quality: Although not specifically measured or quantified through this
impact assessment, the various community water supply projects along with the larger scale
irrigation projects had a tremendous impact on the overall water quality in the Project areas.
This is of particular importance to areas in the North and East, where access to clean and safe
water remains a problematic issue. As detailed in the Report the project has enacted numerous
irrigation projects under component II, Component 1 (community infrastructure development)
as well as through the Addition financing for flood damage rehabilitation.
Accordingly, the VDOs have repaired/ cleaned many existing wells which had been neglected
for a long time. They have also constructed many new wells as well under the project. The
locations of the new wells have been selected as per the guidelines stipulated in the COM.
Water quality tests have been carried out and also environmental aspects have been considered.
Some of the community water supply projects implemented are extension to the existing water
supply projects. For some projects funds were released through the VDOs for easy
procurement. These water supply projects are maintained by the Pradheshia Sabbahs and water
quality tests are being carried out regularly.
Focused Group Discussions
Focused Group Discussions were one of the major qualitative data collection methods utilized
for the RaP Impact Assessment Study. Three types of FGDs were conducted:
       VDO members to capture the performance and current status of their functioning,
        District Project Staff to get their perspective on the project implementation experience,
       lessons learned and challenges; and
       Project Stakeholders including key agencies such as Divisional Secretariats, the CSOs
       and the Public.

Some of the themes covered with FGDs include the following: Compatibility of project design
to achieve project development objectives, Advocacy of project approach and implementing
responsibility, Project effectiveness to restore livelihoods, social and economic re-integration,
                                               93

Community / VDO contribution to project activities, way project addressed social inclusion,
Project impacts and sustainability, Compliance with standards and norms during the
implementation etc.
Key Findings
   a. Evidence from FGDS conducted with the following officials; (Mr. Punithakumar, AC
      Agrarian Services, Trincomalee, Eng. H.M Junaid , Director of Irrigation, Eng.
      S.Subramaniam, CE, Trincomale 19-01-2015, Eng. S. Hemakanth, Irrigation Engineer,
      Chenkalady, 20-01-2015, FGD with FO Members Metkulam Minor Tank, Vauniya,
      FGD with FO Members Muhathankulam, Vauniya), revealed that Infrastructure
      Development interventions, particularly rural roads, small irrigation rehabilitation,
      have benefited resettled people to restore the economic livelihood


   b. Evidence form FGDs with following VDOs; Thammannagama VDO, Puttlam- 13-01-
      2015, Mangalapura VDO, Puttlam 14-01-2015, Poththuwilluwa VDO, Puttlam- 14-
      01-2015, revealed that more than 90% of the VDOs have improved organizational
      capacities. Furthermore, they are generating self-sustaining funds, distributing LSA
      loans to vulnerable persons whilst women have been included into VDO activities. All
      of the VDOs complied with RaP Community Operation Manual (COM) under the
      infrastructure development sub component. These standards and norms were
      introduced by RaP and it has had a positive impact on the project and future activities.


   c. Evidence from FGDs with Project Staff (Polonnaruwa , 13-01-2015, FGD with Project
      Staff -Batticoloa 20-01-2015) revealed that Community Resource Persons ( CRPs) who
      have been deployed as catalysts and facilitators for local level project intervention and
      community mobilizations is one the best features of the RaP project and is a very
      successful model. The CRPs are now playing a key role in sustaining project impacts
      and continue guiding as para-professionals paid by local community after the project
      completion.


   d. Evidence from FGDs with the following VDOs; Neelapola VDO, Seruwila,
      Trincomale, 19-01-2015, FGD with beneficiaries of Kambi Aru Bridge, Eravour Pattu
      Batticoloa, 20-01-2015. FGD with KankeyanOdai and Mavilanthurai VDOs,
      Manmunai Pattu, Batticoloa 20-01-2015 revealed that project interventions had
      significantly improved production capacity, Community accessibility and Social
      integration due to improved infrastructure facilities.


   e. Evidence from FGDs with the following VDOs; (Medamaluwa VDO, Polonnaruwa 12-
      01-2015, Paranagoda VDO, Wellawaya, Monaragala- 24-01-2015, Kithulkote VDO,

       re-settled communities and their livelihoods, community empowerment, especially
       women headed households and their family income etc.


   f. Evidence from FGDs with PMC Member Giant Tank, Mannar 29-01-2015, FGD with
      FO Members Valukkaiyary Scheme, Kilinochchi, 30-01-2015, FGD with FO
      Members, Piramanthalaru scheme, Kilinochchi, 30-01-2015) Mr.A.W Wilson,
      President, Kudagalmitiyawa South FO 19-01-2015) revealed that project interventions
      had increased production and income., especially for paddy and other field crops with
      income increases for project beneficiaries increasing by two to three folds.


   g. Evidence from FGDs with Irrigation Department, Trincomale -19-01-2015, FGD with
      Irrigation Department – Batticoloa 20-01-2015, FGD with Provincial Irrigation
      Department Officers, 20-01-2015) revealed that the increase in the cultivable land
      extent, irrigation conveyance efficiency, and increased cropping intensity are other
      positive impacts which had directly generated net national economic impact to the
      country whilst achieving project development objectives.


   h. Overall, findings of all the FGDs indicate that the project has benefitted in both
      economic and social empowerment of resettled communities, especially, through the
      CRP model which was introduced by RaP and utilized for the first time in Sri Lanka.
      This is one of many sustainable approaches for other development projects. These
      findings of the FGDs were, fully compatible with the project design and with its
      objectives and therefore, RaP was able to achieve its development objectives.

      Summary of Borrower’s ICRR and Comments on Draft ICRR
Introduction:

1.       The primary goals of the Government of Sri Lanka’s (GOSL’s) poverty reduction
strategy are to secure peace and achieve significant transformation in the quality of the
people, especially in rural areas, through increased incomes, economic modernization and
invigoration of the rural economy. About 80% of Sri Lanka’s population and 90% of the
country’s poor live in rural areas including the NE. Sri Lanka is currently faced with the
immense challenge of establishing political, social and economic stability following almost
two decades of armed conflict since 1983. The livelihoods of the people of the eight
administrative districts of the North-East (NE),’ and to a lesser extent, of the four adjoining
districts have been severely affected, and the social and economic costs of the war in these
areas are tremendous.
2.      In the NE and the adjoining areas, the conflict has resulted in, inter alia, disruption
of local economies, damage to essential village-level infrastructure, breakdown of
government- and private-sector input and output markets and technical support services,
dilution of community organizations and institutional networks, shortage of employment
opportunities, and widespread vulnerability and social and economic insecurity. The major
challenge for the affected and returning population, therefore, is to recover from the social
and economic shocks and reintegrate into the socioeconomic mainstream. The conflict has
also weakened the government institutions and administrative mechanisms in the NE and
their ability and capacity to plan, implement and coordinate reconstruction and
development initiatives. In Districts of the NE province are Ampara, Batticoloa, Jaffna,
Kilinochchi, Mannar, Mulaitivu, Trincomalee and Vavuniya Neighboring districts are
Anuradhapura, Pollonnaruwa (North-Central Province), Moneragala (Uva Province) and
Puttlam (North-Western Province). To this end, providing access to shelter, food,
education, water, health and sanitation, finding secure and sustainable on-farm and off-
farm employment opportunities, and rebuilding village-level social networks and
governance structures are essential to build the confidence of the affected and returning
population. The livelihoods of many thousands of displaced people as well as of many
other people who remained behind have fallen apart. However, the emerging prospects for
peace have resulted in over 300,000 displaced persons returning to their pre-war locations.
The returning population as well as the non-displaced, but severely affected, groups needs
urgent support to reestablish their livelihoods and reintegrate with the social and economic
main stream.

3.      The Bank has used and extended funds, under the ongoing IDA Credits in irrigation
and education, to finance minor reconstruction activities in the war-affected areas. In 2000,
the Bank approved the ongoing North-East Irrigated Agriculture project (NEIAP, Cr 3301
CE), mobilizing US$27 million of IDA funding to help jump-start agricultural and small-
scale reconstruction activities of about 400 villages. The proposed NEIAP I1 is a repeater
operation to scale up and augment outputs and impacts of NEW.
4.      Starting in January 2003, a group of donors supporting Sri Lanka, including the
World Bank, in consultation with the GOSL, the LTTE and other stakeholders, carried out
a Needs Assessment for the eight districts of the NE and the four adjoining districts. The
World Bank’s global experience in supporting rehabilitation, reconstruction and
development in post-conflict environments and designing and supporting the
implementation of CDD and social-development programs; and the ability to bring in best
international practices and experience in ensuring transparency, accountability and equity
in targeting and delivering development assistance. The Bank’s participation ensured that
international experience with past and ongoing CDD programs and post-conflict operations
are incorporated into the project design and sound international quality standards of related
technical aspects, social and environmental safeguards, monitoring and evaluation are
applied.
5.      The Project in the emergency situation faced several reputational, social and
operational risks though mitigation measures had been incorporated in the project design.
It contributed and improved the living conditions of the returnees by restoring their
economic livelihoods, and reestablished access to basic social and economic services.
Given the urgency of the interventions needed, the reputational risk to the project high if
the project or bank did not engage with the Government to support quickly to the return of
the IDPs and restoration of their lives and livelihood. A Risk Identification Worksheet,
analyzing major risks, mitigation measures, and residual risks, had been prepared. The
project’s residual risk rating was high of the identified risks.
6.      Since the inception of the project in 2005, project operation mechanism was fueled
by the Community Driven Development (CDD) approach and given priorities to people’s
decision making and direct participation on all development initiatives throughout the sub
project processes. The Project implemented village development works in 1,039 identified
focal villages to support more than 263,000 families containing more than 1 million
direct/indirect beneficiaries and it was operated through more than 22,900 small groups.
The primary focuses of the project directed at, creating essential village infrastructure,
livelihood assistances through setting up small to medium village industries, building
capacity and empowering the people & institutions, creating the environment of self-
reliance, increasing village production and income while encouraging for smooth

reintegration with economic mainstreams. Basically the project programs have been
funded under the three credit lines from the Sponsored organization of World Bank, namely
Credit 1 – Original credit, Credit 2 -Additional Financing 1 and Credit 3 – Additional
Financing 2/3 (FDR).
Overall Outcome Rating: Satisfactory
7.     The Livelihood Support Activities helped to the active poor to emerge out of the
poverty trap through developing their sustainable income generation capacity. There is a
noticeable significant improvement in the quality of life and their standard of living through
the positive impact of economic and social factors such as improvement of self-
employment opportunities, income and saving level, fulfillment of basic needs, and self-
confidence level etc.
Village Rehabilitation and Development

8.      Impact from Livelihood Support Fund on Employment: The total number of
beneficiaries benefited under this scheme is 80,636, including youths, Women Headed
Families and differently able people. Before joining the scheme, the situation was that the
standard of living of the people was low. They depended on government subsidies and
especially they depended on Samurthi. Lack of collateral security, no land ownership, no
valuable property, indebtness, poor credit discipline, were the negative factors which kept
the poor away from formal Banking services. So they were unemployed. But after joining
the scheme the beneficiaries received loans and utilized these loans to start self-
employment activities. Especially this scheme helped women to be independent and to
protect their families from vulnerability. Through the self-employment they earn sufficient
income that could provide a safeguard against a crisis situation by building up household
assets such as a permanent house, motor vehicle, jewelry, television, radio etc. and such
assets can be sold if needed. They can also be used as security or proof of credit worthiness
when dealing with businessmen or lending agencies.

9.      Impact from Livelihood Support Fund on Youths Skill Development and
Employment: Skill training and assisting youth in finding employment is one of the
activities under livelihood support component a total of 1,698 youth have been successfully
linked to jobs in garment industry, construction and retail. Furthermore, 363 youth have
been assisted with heavy vehicle training and linked to jobs in the middle-east.

10.     Impact of Livelihood Support Activities on Income, Saving, Basic Needs
Fulfillment: Self-employment enhanced possibilities of beneficiaries to increase their
family incomes. Prior to the implementation of microfinance the beneficiaries couldn’t
have meals at three times per day. But now they could have three time meals with sufficient
calorie. The self-employment activities’ income provides the ability to access better health
                                             98

facilities. Earlier the people fully depended on government hospital. But now 70%
beneficiaries could go to private hospital for emergency situations.

11. Prior to Livelihood support activities’ implementation the educational standard of their
family was very poor. The school dropout was also high. But at present 71% of the
beneficiaries have an ability to provide better education to their children. Their children
now go to school regularly and participate in extracurricular activities. 21% of the
beneficiaries’ children go to private tuitions as well.

12. At the earlier period most of the beneficiaries lived in temporary sheds and damaged
houses. They also lacked pure water and they had to go far to collect water from public
wells and had no sealed toilets. The employments through microfinance provide an ability
to improve the standard of housing with water and sanitation facilities. 68% of the
beneficiaries have built permanent house with water, sanitation and electricity facilities.
The rest of the beneficiaries have built semi-permanent houses.

13. After Livelihood support activities implementation the beneficiaries’ ability to have
small savings has increased. Their banking habit also increased. Some beneficiaries have
the ability to reinvest their money to enhance their employment and also to invest in
modern technology within the business.

14.     Savings by Small Groups: A total of 23,005 small groups were formed. By their
regular weekly saving, total amount saved Rs.143.2 Mn. Small groups have close
relationship with each group and conduct regular weekly meetings for mutual support.

15.     Impact from provision of Market linkages support to the beneficiaries: Self-
employment run by poor people cannot be broadly successful because they have limited
opportunities to borrow money. Therefore they suffered due to lack of marketing facilities
and they needed marketing support to reach customers. Market Linkages were built up with
the marketing institutions by RAP project. The number of individual market linkages under
the Rap project is over 2,000. The income received by the beneficiaries from sale through
the market linkages is Rs………….. Mn. The market linkages setup will help to long term
sustainability of their self-employment businesses. Most the beneficiaries got collective
efficiency with the help of market linkages.

16.     Impact from bank linkages support to the beneficiaries: After the provision of
 st
1 and 2nd stages of loan provision to the 123,471 successful beneficiaries the RAP project
provided bank linkages support to them for further expansion of their self-employment
activity and sustainability of their business. The bank linkage program facilitated several
Commercial Banks linkages. So far, 27 VDOs & Beneficiary have received loans of around
Rs 220 Mn.

17.    Impact from Insurance Support to the beneficiaries: Provision of Insurance
support has helped beneficiaries to recover from losses. Apart from giving this assistance
to farmers, the project has helped in revolving fund loan recovery.

18.      Impact of Livelihood support activities on development of self-confidence and
women empowerment: Further there were main issues regarding the gender as well, such
as; cultural barriers, domestic violence, traumatized societies(women have lost self-
confidence due to conflict), young widows, burden on women headed families, limited
education facilities to village women, malnutrition among women & children, limited
employment opportunities to women, lack of leadership in political and community
activities, lack of independent decision making, lack of knowledge on women’s rights,
inadequate women leadership, men dominated decision making in traditional families and
inadequate gender participation in development process etc.

19.     Livelihood support activities has helped to change the circumstances and the
possibilities for development of social and political roles of women, greater participation
in leadership, communication, the ability to run domestic industry, ability to take decision
on time, knowledge of credit system, ability to handle problems and the ability to forecast
income and expenditure. So they have more self-confidence which is necessary to run the
self-employment successfully.

20.     Prior to the Livelihood support activities implementation the women did not go to
work and fully depended on men. Women empowerment is a process which gives power
to face challenge and to change the status of women. The unique feature of Livelihood
support activities scheme is that it focuses on women for development. More than 90% of
women participants have been empowered from this scheme. The women started self-
employment with the financial assistance in order to earn an independent income which
subsequently helps them to contribute towards their households. This economic
independence empowers the women with greater self-respect and self-confidence. Now
the women are taking grater part in family decision making process. They have access and
control of economic resources such as family income, family saving, ownership of house,
ownership of land, and possession of gold and jewelry and are involved in various
household financial decisions such as preparing household budget, making small and large
purchases, selling property etc. Further the women also participate in community
development activities which are undertaken in their villages.

21.     Loan Tracking System: The implementation of the Loan Tracking System is a
one of the Key factor for the effective monitoring and successful implementation of the
livelihood support activity. If the system implemented from the beginning stages of the
project, the successful percentage will be high.

Gender:

22. According to the Community Operational Manual (COM) of the Re-awakening
Project, more than 51% from the total beneficiaries involved in the project activities
should be represented by ladies of members of the respective Village Development
Organizations. According to the implementation procedure of the project, it has ready been
achieved in different ways as mentioned below:

23.    Women participation in general to implement the project activities under Village
Development Organizations: The total number of beneficiaries involved for the project is
98404. Out of them females are 63964(65% except Puttalam). That shows that, majority of
the beneficiaries are ladies.

24.    Participation of women to conduct Maha Saba meetings at the village level: For
most of the project activities, ladies are participated as mentioned above. In each and every
3 months period a Maha Saba meeting should be conducted in the VDO. For those, most
of the time ladies of those particular villages were attended. As an example, in
Abayapyapura VDO in Ampara, out 56 members participated 91% were women. This is
common in all other VDO also.

25.     Involvement of women in small group activities: The total numbers of small groups
formed by the project activities are. To continue the project activities at the village level,
most of the time beneficiaries will have to work together as small groups. For this, small
groups meetings and other activities, majority are women. For example, in Putlam, the total
number of VDOs is 52 and the total number of members in small groups are 6,272. Out of
these about 5,879 are women (94%).

26.    Micro financing and family income generation activities: Most of the beneficiaries
who took loans from the project and revolving funds are 126,514. Out of these, 96,057
(76%) are female according to the progress report of September 2014.

27.     Family Economy Enhancement Program: The FEEP program, which was
introduced in the first quarter of 2103, contributed to enhance the economy of women. The
beneficiaries of this program were all widows. Financial assistance was provided with the
objective of enhancing their economic conditions providing Rs.10,000 for a fixed deposit
and providing assistance for livelihoods (Poultry, Cattle Farming, Small Business etc.).
This program was implemented in 8 project implementing districts and the total number of
ladies involved is 226 individuals (100%). The total beneficiaries are 751, including their
family members.

28.     Skill development: Some VDO and Mini cluster projects were introduced by the
project for some villages to promote group level production activates. Some of those were
                                             101
Sri Lanka RaP ICRR                                                 Annex 7: Borrower’s ICRR


envelops making in Mannar, Palmyra products in Kilinochchi, and cashew nuts production
in Puttalam. For those special training programs were conducted to improve participants
skill on particular activities For these projects 100% ladies were participated..

29.     Capacity building activities: With the funds provided through the project, several
training programs were implemented to improve beneficiary livelihood activities as well
as VDO maintenance activities (both administrative and financial).

30.     Appointing Community Resource Persons (CRP) at village level: Total number of
VDOs established for the project activities is 805. For each of those, there is a Community
Resource Person appointed to implement the project activities. Most of the CRPs are
female. Out of 704 CRPs in VDOs.660 are covered by women; a participation rate of 94%.
These women were able to improve their capacities by: (i) Exposing them to external govt.
and non-govt. organizations with proper linkages; (ii) They were able to take the leadership
of the village with improved capabilities; (iii) They were acting as coordinator and the
resource person to the village as they could collect all the information of the village; and
(iv) Some of the better CRPS aware promoted as Community Mobilizers and worked for
the project.

31.     Community contribution to the implement and maintain village level infra
development activities: With rehabilitation of rural roads and drinking water facilities,
women were benefited by saving their time to collect water ,reaching town and other places
easily and specially attending hospitals when they need immediate transport.

32.    Conducting different types of welfare improving activities: Following different
welfare activities has been introduced by the project to improve the cohesiveness among
members of the villages. For those, most of the participants were females. Those were
Shramadhana, religious activities, Dhansal, Food offerings and adults appreciating
programs.

33.     Improving family nutritional level of families: There was several training programs
(Both theoretical and practical) were conducted in each village on family nutrition. For all
of those, ladies were participated (100%).

34.    Contribution towards food security of the families: Home gardening was the
major activity promoted through the reject to increase the food production in the home
garden. It reduces the cost of family as well as increase the food security.

35.      Contribution of ladies towards savings of the families: Through small group
activities and with linkages with banks, most of the ladies were able to save some money
in small groups and in banks which reduced their dependency on others.

Sri Lanka RaP ICRR                                                 Annex 7: Borrower’s ICRR


Improvement of the public and private linkages of the villages: As linking village people
without side sectors, members were linked with public companies and govt. and non govt.
banks.

36.     Contribution of the women towards technology transferring process within and
among villages: A decision has been taken by the Project Director to give a poly net house
(CSA) to each CRP to produce plants and vegetables necessary for their family
consumption. That was done with major objective of transferring CSA technology to
village level. About such-------number of CSA poly net houses was given to villages by
the project and most of them were able to transfer the technology and demonstrate the
benefits of those to others in surrounding areas. At the same time they were able to produce
chemical free vegetable for their consumption. It added a value for home gardening. So,
they were able to reduce the cost of vegetables in their families.

37.     In general, most of the women in villages were able to get together as small groups
and that improved their unity among the surrounding community. So, that brings the social
safeguard also to a certain level. As women are involved in income generation activities,
ladies contribution for the family also improved. Widows were able live in a better way. It
can be proposed that, women should be given priority and get their involvement in future
such rural development projects.

Major Irrigation and Infrastructure Development

On completion of the rehabilitation of major/minor irrigation schemes, the land extent has
been significantly improved in both the seasons Yala and Maha. The land extent in minor
irrigation schemes/lift irrigation increased by 31%. In minor tanks it got increased by 38%,
in rehabilitation of major irrigations schemes increased by 84%, in irrigation schemes
under Flood Damaged Rehabilitation increased by 21%. The overall increase in
productivity can be directly attributed to the increased conveyance efficiency and a
reduction in water delivery times, reduced water loss from necessary repairs, and a
consistent ground water level in the nearby wells. As a result, farmers are able to have
access to sufficient quantity of irrigated water at the correct time, which has enabled them
to cultivate more area, particularly in the yala season. This has also significantly reduced
the conflict among the farmers on sharing water.
Financial Management
The Financial Management arrangements in the project was established and
institutionalized as per the Financial Management (FM) manual. The project has
successfully developed rules and regulations for carrying out operations in financial
management and incorporated them in various manuals such as FM Manual and
Community Operational Manuals (COMs). The required authorities in financial
                                            103
Sri Lanka RaP ICRR                                                Annex 7: Borrower’s ICRR


management were decentralized into the DPMU levels. The levels of controls were
developed and approval limits at various levels were also clearly established. All annual
audits done on time, reports were submitted to the Donor and Government before the due
dates. No major incidents of misappropriations or misconduct in financial dealings at every
level of the project.
Social Development & Environmental Aspects
38.    The well-known Re-awakening Project (RaP), therefore, travelled with very
comprehensive safeguard guidance and procedure through its project period. The
Environmental Safeguard Management Framework (ESMF) had been prepared by PMU
and approved by the World Bank to guide and to ensure the implementation Social and
Environmental Safeguard activities during the project implantation. And also, the tools,
instruments and the process for the implementation and monitoring of environmental
safeguard activities were mentioned in the Community Operation Manual _ Volume 06
too. The project highly involved rehabilitation activities and cause negligible amount of
negative impacts in the project sites and have high positive Social and Environmental
impacts. The project strongly adhered the Bank Policies and Operational Procedure such
as OP 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement), OD 4.20 (Indigenous Peoples), OP 4.01
(Environmental Assessment),( OP 4.04 Natural Habitats), OP 4.09 (Pest Management),
OP 4.36 (Forestry) and OP 4.37 (Safety of Dams) to satisfy the requirements of Social and
Environmental needs.
Environmental Safeguards and Management:
39.     The overall progress of the Environmental Safeguards Compliance and
Development was rated as satisfactory by the World Bank Implementation Review and
Support Mission from 2012. The village level overall existing prominent Environmental
issues had been identified during the VDPs preparation process with the help of the
respective village peoples in war affected districts (12 Districts) and the total of 1039
VDPs are available. The small infrastructure sub-projects and livelihood developments
project activities were monitored by with the support of existing reporting formats and
Environmental Code of Practices (ECoPs). It was observed that the project staff had
periodical monitoring and prepared Environmental Assessment for each and every
subproject .The booklets of assessment sheets and EMPs prepared were maintained in
PMU and APD office. EIA & EMP for major irrigation works were done by consultants
firms the EIAs and EMPs prepared were approved by the World Bank. The monitoring of
implementation of EMPs was carried out Environmental Monitoring Committee (EMC)
which includes all relevant stakeholders with EO. Four EIA & EMP reports were prepared
for the major Irrigation tanks rehabilitated under the RaP namely Giant tank, Allai

Extension Scheme, Rugam and Karavahu Irrigation scheme. Also one IEE & EMP reports
for the Valukkai Aru rehabilitation works were maintained.
40.     Mapping of projects in the 1:50,000 scales had been prepared to plan and monitor
the project executions in a routine manner. The projects locations were also marked on a
1:250,000 Survey Department map and then displayed at environmental officers locations
at APD premises for easy monitoring.
Environmental Auditing:
41.      The project has prepared three Environmental Auditing Reports (2012, 2013 and
2014) to identify the standards in the environmental management and then recognize the
adherence to them during a project intervention. This used as internal management tool to
facilitate management control of operating practices and to assess compliance with
organizational policies. The audit reports prepared were evident that the performances of
implementation of environmental activities were satisfactory and improving positively.
Environmental interventions in Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) Poly net houses:
42.    Under the CSA ploy net house program following Environmental Best Practices
were adopted in 165 no of poly net houses. Maintaining compost production throughout
the year and also practically use it in their poly net house(s) and the home garden,
Production and usage of Herbal Pest Replant in their poly net house(s) and the home
garden, Introduce bio-fencing plants, Growing Companion plants, usage of Yellow sticky
Trap, Maintain wooden ash, burned oil etc. to control the pest attack and Use polythene
cover for fruits, vegetable to control pest attract and Practice mulching to control the weeds
and maintenance of moisture.
Special Environmental Programmes:
43.     (a) Icon Project: Avenue Tree Planting at Kankeyanodai Iran Village in Batticaloa
Districts. Around 200 Gaya trees were established and that help to improve micro climate
and the scenic beauty of the village; and (b) Removal of death trees from the sea: During
the flood large numbers of casuarina trees were taken into the sea and three beach scene
area were affected. Nearly 300 fishing families were benefitted and the beach scene areas
were cleaned under the cash for work program.
Positive Environmental Impact of the Project intervention:
44.     It is clearly evidence that the large number of beneficiaries and other communities
were trained and educated through the project on the Environmental aspects. So it will help
the societies to maintain, conserve their resources and their assets developed in sustainable
ways and can use the knowledge in future.

45.     Large numbers of Irrigation tanks were developed through the project and the
quantity of water captured was improved. So maintaining the water through the year helped
to improve the water table in the surrounding area. It was noticed that the availability of
water even during the dry season in the wells in surrounding places after improvements of
the tanks. It is also notice that large number of cattle, buffalos and other wildlife were
benefited in the dry zone by the development. The recent field visits showed that
sustainability of the more vegetation were other evidences to the improvements in the
ground water level. The farmers interviewed during the field visit showed that the
improvements tanks helped in many ways especially more extent of land used and
cultivation other field crops during dry periods.

Social Safeguards Measures - Utilization of Additional land for Infrastructure
Activities

46.     All infrastructure and livelihood supporting activities financed under Re-
Awakening Project are required to adopt Social safeguard measures in order to ensure that
these activities causes minimum adverse impacts on the society/peoples. The Bank's
Operational Policy 4.12: Involuntary Resettlement is triggered in situations involving
involuntary taking of land and involuntary restrictions of access to legally designated parks
and protected areas. The policy aims to avoid involuntary resettlement to the extent
feasible, or to minimize and mitigate its adverse social and economic impacts. It promotes
participation of displaced people in resettlement planning and implementation, and its key
economic objective is to assist displaced persons in their efforts to improve or at least
restore their incomes and standards of living after displacement. The policy prescribes
compensation and other resettlement measures to achieve its objectives and requires that
borrowers prepare adequate resettlement planning instruments prior to Bank appraisal of
proposed projects.
47.      During the implementation of the sub projects activities under the Reawakening
Project, around 7,588.72 perch of additional land were gained from different sectors. Large
extent of additional lands (5,119.93 perch or 67.47 %) were provided by the government
institutions but the private owners were supported to more projects (139 no.) than
government sector (121 no.). More extents of additional lands (4043.60 perch or 53.28%)
were taken for the construction of community buildings and second for the agricultural
road construction (1751.00 perch or 23.07%) and the third for the drinking water supply
activities (990.12 perch or 13.05%). The land donated by the private owns were undergone
by the proper land use procedures and provided to the village infra development activities.
Due to the project intervention no single displacement or resettlement activities were
reported. The rehabilitated subprojects under taken under the Reawakening Project have
been handed over to the respective agency for the future maintenance.

48.     To maintain a community Driven Development approach, the project worked with
the Rural Development Societies (RDS), Women Rural development Societies (WRDS)
and Farmer Organizations (FO) as the village level Implementation institutions in the batch
one of the project. These CBOs were strengthen, re-organized or newly formed in the
project villages for the successful implementation of the project. These CBOs were
registered with the government departments (North East provincial Agencies) and
monitored by the departmental officials where these CBOs needed final authorization from
those department officials for implement the decision they made in the village level. And
also, the escalation of violence made it difficult to implement large scale infrastructure
project in conflict affected area through these public sector agencies, the community
demand for immediate livelihood support too increased. Due to these reasons, the NEIAP
II project was re-structured in July 2007 as Re-Awakening project (RaP) where Village
Development Organization (VDO) was created in every focal village to implement the
Village Rehabilitation & Development component of the project.
49.      The strong project management unit was established with sector specialist and
staffs after the re-structuring of the project as the implementation methodology is changed.
The project was implemented through the NE provincial council departments but it was
brought to the Ministry of Economic development (ministry of Nation Building before)
directly, and the VDO also registered under the District Project Management Units of the
Project. The project implementation took a new dimension where the involvement of
Provincial and central government was limited to appraisal committee level and providing
technical service on the request of the VDO.
50.     The VDOs were formed and managed under the guidance of Community
Operational Manual (COM), which is a part of the project appraisal document and
registered under the project (District Project Management Unit) as a temporary measure to
implement the project. The structure of the VDO gave opportunity to all the group of people
in the village to become as member where other CBOs were not and developed as a major
CBO. Women, Men, Farmers, Youths, Disables, ex-combatant and others were able to join
the VDO to become a part of the project and the development process of their villages.
These Village Development Organization formed by the beneficiaries of focal village is
fully responsible for implantation of the project at village level based on the subproject
priority identified by them.
51.    The development field of the country experienced the new structure of the VDO
with the specific task/sector based subcommittees formed from the small groups emerged
through the social mobilization process, which made involve all the member of the VDO
on decision making and implementation and also increased the efficiency, transference and
ownership of the project activity over its beneficiaries. The VDO is the first CBO in the

                                            107

village with the village development fund with the decision making and implementation
authority guided with divisional and district level appraisal committee of service providers
or stake holders. Emerged small groups formed as the foundation for the VDO and the
development process where the members interacted to decide about their development and
village development. The savings of the small groups provided them a financial freedom
for their urgent requirement and also for development of their livelihood. Some small
groups took a step further to involve in collective businesses to earn income.
52.      The Community Resource Person (CRP) was appointed by the VDO to support the
activities of the VDO on documentation and mobilization and for the first time this CRP
methodology introduced to the country. The CRPs as the volunteer staff of the VDO, they
were trained and developed to support the VDOs on their tasks. They were trained on
Accounting, Documentation, Public Private Partnership (PPP), livelihood development
and Business plan preparation, Mobilization, Bank linkages, Livestock rearing and
management and agriculture and value addition to support the VDO and community
whenever necessary. They were the bridge between the project and the VDO and also they
took a major role in strengthening the VDO, SG and making PPP and Bank linkages.
53.     The small groups system helped improve the capacity of the community specially
soon after the resettlement, where people got together in small group and shared their
problems and planned to re-start their life. The infrastructure fund helped improve their
capacity on mobility (by renovating the roads) access to drinking water (wells/tube wells),
cultivation (irrigation tank were rehabilitated for better cultivation) and to get together and
discuss and address their issues and requirements (The community buildings. The savings
of small group and the livelihood fund of the VDO provided the capacity of people to start
their livelihood back with confident. The trainings given to the beneficiaries on
Agriculture, Organic farming, Livestock, Integrated pest management (IPM), business
development and value addition gave the capacity to start their own livelihood with updated
technology in the industry confidently. The improved savings habit through the SG and the
credit discipline developed though the livelihood loan of the project has increases the
capacity of project beneficiaries to access the commercial banks for additional loans.

54.      Skill development program to the youths increased the capacity of the youth to find
a skill job with good salary where most of the youths in the conflict affected area been
discontinued their formal education. The ex-combatants released from the rehabilitation
camp were able to re-start their livelihood with the assistance from the Livelihood fund
and the bank linkages as the VDO had capacity to do so.
55.    Though the project implementation and management arrangement changed from
the Provincial Council to the Central Government Ministry, the project management unit
and district project management units were strengthen with qualified full time employees

and sector specialist especially for Monitoring evaluation, Community development and
Business development. Staff capacity was developed through trainings and exposure visits
to support the VDOs on implementing the project activities and to liaise with other
stakeholders. The capacity of the VDO increased as the new CBO in its structure and
performance as major institution in the village with huge village development fund, with
the newly introduced CRP system. The CRPs were trained on all the aspects to assist VDO
to carry out all its tasks. The social audit committee introduced with the VDO structure
been effectively functioned to ensure the quality and transference of VDO performance.
The VDOs have been registered with the social service organization act to bring them under
the monitoring of the Divisional Secretaries considering the sustainability of the VDOs and
the village development funds.

Other Unintended Outcome and Impacts (positive or negative)

56.     Positive:      Though villages of Sri Lanka have various community driven
organizations for various social development work, community driven development
system of village especially on infrastructure & economic improvement is a new thinking
after so many decades. Due to this system, project could support villagers to fulfill their
needs rather than waiting for politicians, government officials or custodian
departments/institutions to decide by themselves to do what they need.
57.      Reconstruction or rehabilitation of major/minor irrigation schemes have given
following additional results such as Increase of ground water table; Mitigation of flood;
Enhance water evaporation there by more rain (enhance water cycle); Drinking water
facility for wild life & Fauna; Improve sanitation practices; and Inland fishery. Drinking
water facility will help for better health, better sanitation practices, time saving etc. Due to
rural road rehabilitation work hamlets, villages were connected together. Due to this
urbanization of rural area to a certain extent and more social development activities will
take place. Due to above said infrastructure development work, mal-nutrition will get
reduced while improving the health; education, intelligence and strong work force. In short
project expenditure is a worth full investment for all-round development of Sri Lanka and
increase the life span of citizens

58.     Negative:       Small grouping has been done artificially in some villages. Every
village or any society has their own small grouping based on relationship, cast, economical
work, cultural etc. Survival of artificially created small grouping may not sustain longer.
Social & interpersonal connection gets reduced of rural folk due to giving water facility to
individual house. Due to concreting of road surface and concreting of side drains reduce
the water absorption to the ground.

Borrower’s Ratings on the World Bank’s Performance
59.     The World Bank fielded regular support and review missions during the project
implementation period and it facilitated satisfactory completion of the project in a
transparent and trustworthy manner. The relationship of the Bank headquarters, the
Country office of the World Bank and the Project Management Unit (PMU) of the Ministry
of Economic Development is very important to implement the project agreements, and
concepts, and smooth implementation of programs and compliance of the conditions lay
down. Very candid and transparent manner with which the functions were carried out left
no room for breakdowns. The common challenges encountered were boldly and
professionally dealt with by all parties concerned. Bank teams were able to obtain good
access to the project sites and engage with the communities and stakeholders as well as
information needed to measure and observe the progress of the project. The manner and
efficiency in which the Task Team worked to prepare the additional financings to assist the
war and flood affected people were commendable. The intellectual treatment to respond to
project assessments by the able leadership of the task team leaders, fostering the intellectual
support from the Bank Board, Senior Vice Presidents, Sector Directors and Sector
Managers who took time to visit the project and discuss with the beneficiaries in their
villages and stakeholders to identify issues and observe results generated through project
interventions on the ground reflects the source of inspiration for collaboration.
LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION

60.    The experience gained from project implementation reveals that the following
actions have to be taken into consideration during the implementation of microfinance
scheme in order to increase the effectiveness of microfinance as a sustainable development
tool:

61.    Beneficiary selection: Reaching the relevant target group (economically active
poor) is important to achieve the project objectives. The selection criteria should be
transparent and followed strictly to select proper beneficiaries.

62.     Role of VDOs in microfinance implementation: VDOs take a key role in the
successful implementation of microfinance. For this, the capacity of the members of the
VDO and their job satisfaction is necessary because we release the fund to VDOs to
implement the revolving loan fund scheme. The project provided training to people to
create awareness about the scheme and also skill training to start self-employment. After
this training had been provided to strengthen the VDOs, the project handed over the
revolving loan fund to the VDOs. Thereafter, VDOs were responsible for the successful
implementation of the revolving loan fund. In addition, VDO members’ selection is being
done on the basis of nomination by friends in some cases. Such selections do not give
                                             110

adequate consideration to a person’s commitment to voluntary service. Therefore, proper
members should be selected. Some of the VDO members are inactive and therefore the
VDOs should be reformed on every two years.
63.      Sustainability of revolving loan fund activities: Livelihood Support Fund is a
subsidy given in helping the poor to cross the poverty line and become useful members of
the society. However, we cannot provide this subsidy indefinitely and has to withdraw from
the scheme at an appropriate time. At that time, the scheme should have gained the
capability of continuing its work on its own. If it could do so, it is sustainable. Otherwise
it is not. The improvements when added to microfinance scheme will ensure its
sustainability are: (a) The capacity of the poor should be developed for them to stand on
their own feet without depending on external assistance for further development; (b) The
subsidy element that is provided during the initial phase should be restricted and time-
lined. The participating poor should know in advance that it would be withdrawn on an
appointed date and thereafter, the poor will have to look after themselves; (c) The
possibility for moral hazard practices or adverse selection should be eliminated in all
aspects of Livelihood Support Fund. This requires non-subsidized credit, time-restricted
assistance and competition among the microfinance institutions; (d) Implementing
institutions should develop an effective self-regulatory mechanism which could be
supplemented by the introduction of good behavior practices, benchmarks, norms and
values for Livelihood Support Activities; (e) Government Staff Vs. Private staff
(Implementing institutions) good relationship is necessary for the sustainability of the
Livelihood Support Activities ; and (f) Proper institutional setup is necessary to carry out
the Livelihood Support Activities after exit the project.
