ACKGROUND 
 
1. 
On 27 May 2006, a massive earthquake (registering 6.3 on the Richter scale) struck the 
populous south-central coast of Java, killing 5,744 people and severely damaging infrastructure, 
housing, schools and clinics.  In districts across Yogyakarta and neighboring Central Java, 350,000 
houses were damaged beyond repair and 278,000 suffered lesser damage.  Beyond housing, 
damage and losses to businesses in the productive sector were considerable, impacting about 
116,000 livelihoods. 
 
2. 
The reconstruction efforts of the Government of Indonesia (GoI) have been impressively 
effective and as of June 2007, more than 80 percent of affected houses were repaired or replaced,
2
and good progress had been achieved in repairing the infrastructure.  Despite this success, however, 
according to a recent report for the Java Reconstruction Fund (JRF), the region has not yet 
recovered from the profound economic impact of disaster.
3
3. 
An April 2007 business survey conducted by the UNDP concluded that productive sectors 
in both provinces had made substantial progress in recovery, with 95 percent of the affected 
entrepreneurs having resumed activity and 47 percent having reached pre-earthquake capacities.
4
Effective community self-help strategies have been a major factor behind this recovery.  The report, 
however, indicated that about 53 percent of the affected enterprises were still struggling to recover 
from the earthquake damage and were not in a position to do so without external support. 
 
4. 
The main constraints for full recovery are:  
·
Access to finance for both fixed and working capital investments;
5
·
Loss of buyers/markets; and, 
·
Inadequate basic business skills including in financial administration, product development, 
and marketing. 
 
5. 
In light of the strong emphasis by the GoI and international donors on emergency and 
housing needs, livelihood recovery programs have so far received less attention and have been 
consistently under funded.  The United Nations (UN) Livelihood Cluster has implemented 
livelihood programs of about USD4.7 million, representing only 4 percent of total cluster 
contribution to earthquake recovery.
6
Furthermore, many international and local Non 
Governmental Organizations (NGOs) are closing down their programs.

Rehabilitating Livelihoods in Post-Earthquake Yogyakarta and Central Java Provinces: A Report Prepared for the 
Java Reconstruction Fund, May 2007.  The JRF, a multi donor fund of about USD80 million, was put in place 
following the Java Earthquake to assist the Indonesian authorities with their earthquake recovery efforts.  Of this 
amount, about USD60 million has been used for housing reconstruction.  The balance of about USD20 million is to be 
used for livelihood recovery.

Businesses have depleted their own resources.  Access to additional finance for further repairing of the fixed assets, 
tools, and working capital is proving to be a serious barrier.

The proposed project aims to assist the restoration of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises 
(MSME) by addressing the main barriers to their recovery through a comprehensive package of 
targeted assistance in coordination with and complementing the efforts of the GoI and the donor 
community.
8
The design of the project has taken into account lessons learned from implementing 
previous recovery activities undertaken in Central Java and DYI as well as Aceh.  These lessons 
include the importance of:  (i) community and government ownership and involvements at all 
stages of preparation and implementation; (ii) transparent targeting of beneficiaries; (iii) providing 
a
comprehensive package of technical as well as financial assistance to MFIs and MSMEs; (iv) an 
effective outreach program; and (v) robust monitoring arrangements to ensure targeted beneficiaries 
are reached and that funds are used for their intended purpose.

7. The 
GoI
’s National Action Plan for Reconstruction and Rehabilitation
9
is firmly based on 
principles of sustainable development.  The Plan clearly divides reconstruction and rehabilitation 
activities into housing recovery, infrastructure restoration and economic revitalization.  In line with 
the Plan, one year after the earthquake the main focus of activities was expected to shift to the 
revitalization of the regional economy and livelihood.  Specific intervention in sectors and 
variations in districts that have not received support until now or have recovered to a lesser degree 
have been identified by the national and local authorities.  The priorities include:  (a) recovery of 
industry and service sectors with a focus on small-scale industry, agriculture and tourism; (b) 
recovery of the financial service delivery to improve access to finance for Small and Medium 
Enterprises (SMEs); (c) recovery of market access for earthquake-affected SMEs; and, (d) 
sustainable natural resource management in anticipation of increased environmental exploitation.  
The proposed project is fully in line with the above priorities.  
 
8. 
The regional action plans for Central Java and DIY had a strong emphasis on housing and 
public infrastructure during 2006-2007, in terms of financial allocation.  The detailed allocation of 
GoI funds
10
 for various livelihood activities during 2007-2008 is still being discussed by the 
regional governments but it is anticipated that the majority of funding will be directed toward 
physical infrastructure restoration (such as traditional markets) and less toward specific MSE 
assistance.  GTZ is coordinating closely with the local and national authorities in order to fill the 
gaps and avoid duplication of efforts. 
 
9. 
GTZ piloted its recovery support for livelihood on a participatory approach addressing these 
crucial issues shortly after the 2006 earthquake, and can draw from lessons learned and best 
practice achieved in this context.  All activities are implemented in consultation with Indonesian 
government institutions at the local, provincial and national level.  All implementing and operating 
guidelines for reconstruction and rehabilitation projects and all activities are planned in 
coordination with local governments to specify geographic locations and sectors for assistance.

Particularly IOM which will be implementing a parallel JRF financed project.  See Project Document for IOM, dated 
September 10, 2008.

The overall objective of the project is to contribute to the GoI’s initiatives to assist micro, 
small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) affected by the earthquake to revitalize their businesses 
and to re-integrate affected low income communities into economic life.  The project focuses 
particularly on remote communities which have received little assistance so far. 
 
11. 
The project will aim to: 
 
·
Rehabilitate micro-enterprises to pre-earthquake levels through enhancing their access to 
working capital; 
·
Develop perspectives for sustainable income generating opportunities for viable MSMEs; 
·
Assist viable SMEs with defaulting loans and their creditors to achieve mutually beneficial 
work-out strategies for existing non-performing loans; 
·
Provide assistance for medium size enterprises to rebuild their premises and replace 
equipment and upgrade their overall competitiveness; 
·
Strengthen financial institutions in the earthquake affected areas as a basis for sustainable 
economic development.

12. 
Details on implementation and eligibility criteria for all components of the project are 
provided in Annex VI.  The project consists of four components.
 
(a) Component I.  Access to finance linked to technical assistance for MSEs
 
(US$4.58 
million).  Under this component the recipient will provide credits and technical 
assistance to eligible MSEs through the PNM (as the Apex) and a number of partner 
financial institutions, including microfinance institutions/cooperatives (MFIs) and 
BPRs.  Technical assistance will also be available to the partner financial institutions.  
All are officially registered and accredited with the GoI and in good standing with the 
regulator (e.g. Bank of Indonesia in case of BPRs).  It is expected that up to about 10 
MFIs and 40 BPRs would participate in the project.
11
 
The size of the credits would range from about US$20-500 equivalent for loans from 
non-bank MFIs and about US$500-2,500 for loans from BPRs.  Financial intermediaries 
will take the credit risk on all financing.  Cooperatives and NGOs will be responsible for 
the implementation of basic entrepreneurial skills trainings through field officers.  
11
 The number of participating BPR is estimated based on the total number of BPR operating in the affected region 
(Special District Yogyakarta and south eastern part of the Central Java province), and adjusted by an estimated number 
of BPR not qualified and not interested in the participation in the proposed schemes.  These estimates are also based on 
the experience gained when selecting BPRs participating in previous GTZ-supported activities. 
Page  9

Business Development Service Providers and individual experts will undertake skills 
training activities.  Vocational training institutes are also available to offer in-house or 
on-the-spot training. 
 
(b) Component II.  Default
ing loan “work-out” strategy for viable enterprises
 
(US$1.98 million).  Under this component the project will assist eligible SMEs whose 
loans with BPRs are in arrears to renegotiate/work-out the loans.  Additional 
funding/lending could also be provided to the SMEs under this component.  Selected 
BPRs (40 expected) and PNM will receive capacity building technical assistance.  
Technical assistance will also be provided to the SMEs for preparing business plans to 
show long-term viability and creditworthiness.  In cases where new financing is needed, 
project funds will be available to the BPRs for on-lending to the SMEs.  The size of the 
credits would range from US$500-3,000 equivalent, or US$10,000 equivalent, subject to 
the Bank’s prior agreement on a case by case basis.  Financial intermediaries will take 
the credit risk on all financing.
 
(c) Component III.  Restoring full capacity and creating opportunities for improving 
competitiveness of medium size enterprises
 (US$1.59 million).  Under this 
component the project will provide credit to eligible medium size enterprises for capital 
investments towards civil works or replacement of machinery.  This will be 
complemented, as necessary, with technical assistance for product improvement and 
regaining access to markets.  Loan sizes are expected to range from about US$20,000-
50,000 equivalent.  Financial intermediaries will take the credit risk on all financing.  
 
Note on On-lending under all Components of the Project 
Funds destined for final beneficiaries under components I through III will be channelled through 
PNM to participating MFIs and BPRs which will be selected based on predefined criteria.
12
 
PNM 
will assist GTZ in selection and monitoring of the financial intermediaries and will help provide 
technical assistance to these intermediaries for capacity building as described above and as necessary.  
In addition, GTZ will ensure financial expertise will be provided, as necessary, to ensure proper and 
transparent management of loan funds.   
GTZ will sign a Memorandum of Understanding
13
 (MOU) with PNM, on terms and conditions 
acceptable to the Bank, in order to transfer funds to PNM on a non-reimbursable basis to finance 
subprojects for the benefit of eligible MSMEs, and in accordance with the guidelines, procedures and 
criteria set forth in the Project Management Manual.  PNM will assist the GTZ in selection and 
monitoring of the financial intermediaries and will help provide technical assistance to these 
intermediaries in their lending activities as necessary.  PNM will onlend proceeds to selected MFIs at 
an interest rate of not more than 7 percent annually, with a repayment period of not more than 5 years, 
in coordination with the IOM to ensure consistency of approach between the two projects. 
The MFIs will repay the interest and principle of the funds received to PNM.  PNM will recycle the 
funds through MFIs to continue to assist enterprises in the region in line with the overall objectives of 
this Project.  To this end, the provincial authorities of Central Java and Yogyakarta are looking into 
ways to ensure PNM will be legally bound, following the closing of the project, to utilize these funds 
through financial intermediaries in the two provinces. 
12
 PNM has its own tested method of rating the MFIs and BPRs.  This will be supplemented by GTZ requirements, 
based on the recent successful Profi project.  PNM and GTZ were implementation partners. 
13
 The MOU between GTZ and PNM will be concluded in the format of a binding GTZ contract called Financing 
Agreement.  
Page  10

(d) Component VI.  Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation
 (US$2.60 
million).  Under this component the project will finance all costs associated with 
management, implementation, and supervision of the project incurred by the GTZ.  This 
amount includes GTZ
’s organization overhead of US$0.66 million (6.5 percent of the 
total estimated costs).

MPLEMENTATION
 
13. 
The Grant recipient and organization responsible for all implementation and management 
issues for the Project will be GTZ (the “Implementing Agency”).  The Implementing Agency will 
be responsible for day-to-day management, procurement, logistics, and all operational details of the 
Project in accordance with IBRD policies and procedures. GTZ will implement this project under a 
co-financing arrangement.  Thus the project will be treated as an additional component of and a 
contribution to the ongoing programme “Strengthening of Small Financial Institutions (ProFI)” 
commissioned by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development.  
 
14. 
GTZ has been working in Indonesia for more than 30 years and has considerable 
international and national experience in implementing similar projects.  In Indonesia, the GTZ team 
has been cooperating with the Bank of Indonesia in supporting micro and small enterprises through 
microfinance and microfinance institutions.  Most recently, GTZ has been successfully 
implementing a similar scheme as the proposed project in Yogyakarta.  The Yogyakarta office 
employs highly qualified local staff and has access to a pool of local and international short-term 
specialists.  The Bank has assessed the capacity of GTZ and its staffs to do procurement under the 
Project.  GTZ has a well-established policy and procedures in doing procurement.  While the staffs 
are not familiar with Bank’s procurement procedures, the Bank could not identify any principle 
differences between both procedures.  In addition, procurements under the Project are relatively 
simple, consisting of selection of individual consultants, consultant firm of small value, and goods 
of small value. Based on the assessment, the Bank anticipates that GTZ’s procurement staffs would 
be able to quickly adopt Bank’s procurement procedures for project’s implementation.  
 
15. 
The project will be managed by a full time international Recovery Advisor who, as the team 
leader, will be responsible for overall project implementation and coordination with partner 
agencies, participating financial institutions, and the local, regional, and national governments in 
Indonesia.  On the technical level and under the guidance of the team leader, there will be 
Technical Advisors working in the three Themes:  A senior technical advisor on livelihood, 
supported by three national regional livelihood advisors and a monitoring expert, will take up and 
coordinate the cooperation with NGOs and cooperatives in the provision of finance and technical 
advisory services for livelihood activities, mainly under Theme 1.  A senior technical advisor on 
startup/export promotion will particularly support micro, small and medium-sized enterprises 
(MSME), will cooperate with MSME-assisting institutions and business development service 
providers and will facilitate the promotion, marketing and sale of MSME products.  The advisor 
will be supported by three national experts: a marketing expert, an event organizer and a 
construction engineer.  A third senior technical advisor, an expert on microfinance, will above all 
be responsible for the coordination and cooperation with microfinance institutions and for the 
strengthening of these institutions.  He/she will work together with five national microfinance 
experts.  The international advisors mentioned above will interact and closely cooperate on matters 
Page  11
6
of common concern.  Whereas the field of work of the senior advisor on livelihoods will mainly 
encompass theme 1 (access to finance linked to technical assistance for micro-small enterprises), 
the other two advisors will deal with all three themes to be covered by the project.  The 
implementation of the project will furthermore be supported by the network of personnel from the 
partner agencies working within the local communities.  An operations manual providing details on 
project implementation procedures is being prepared by GTZ and will be finalized prior to Grant 
effectiveness. 
 
16. 
A midterm review of project will be carried out in conjunction with the Bank not later than 
twelve months from the date of effectiveness or promptly after an amount representing 50 percent 
of the Grant have been disbursed, in cooperation with the Central Java and Yogyakarta 
governments, to review the implementation progress.  Following the Midterm Review, GTZ will 
act promptly and diligently in order to take any corrective action deemed necessary to remedy any 
shortcoming noted in project implementation, or to adopt such other course of action as may be 
required in furtherance of the project objectives.  At the Project level, throughout project 
implementation, the Implementing Agency will conduct meetings and follow up with the 
beneficiaries to evaluate their satisfaction with the assistance provided. 
 
17. Inde
pendent audits of the Implementing Agency’s activities will be carried out in 
cooperation with relevant levels of government and in accordance with Section XII on Auditing. 
 
Implementing Partners (and Service Providers) 
18. 
GTZ will facilitate technical as well as financial assistance to individual businesses in order 
to restore productive capacities and improve the competitiveness of MSMEs as a basis for 
sustainable rehabilitation of livelihoods.  
 
19. 
The capacity of existing financial and technical service providers to offer tailor-made 
services accessible to MSMEs will be strengthened.  Involved financial institutions include 
cooperatives (including Syariah-based cooperatives), Rural Banks (BPR and BPRS) and 
commercial banks with MSME finance windows (eg Bank Bukopin).  Non-financial intermediaries 
include Business Development Services (BDS) providers, business associations and Bank 
Indonesia’s real sector advisors (KKMB).  For Component III GTZ might cooperate closely with 
the Swiss Foundation for Technical Cooperation.  Swisscontact is an international development 
foundation established and supported by the Swiss private sector, with over 30 years of experience 
in Indonesia in the area of medium size enterprise development. The project will exploit synergies 
based on initial planning. Based on expertise needed the project may employ Swisscontact’s 
specialists for “capacity building and training” measures, or contract local institutions that work 
closely together with Swisscontact. 
 
20. 
Potential partners including local NGOs, will compete for contracts under the JRF Project 
through calls for proposals for specific services.  It is expected that the NGOs will be contracted for 
training and provision of TA and MFIs for delivery of financial services.  The selection of the 
implementing partners will be transparent and the selection criteria will be discussed with the local 
and provincial governments.   
 
Page  12
7
21. 
The effectiveness of mechanisms for the provision of technical and financial assistance that 
are used within the ongoing GTZ earthquake recovery assistance program is widely recognized, 
and forms an integral part of the proposed approach. 
 
22. 
Selection of partner MFIs will be carried out by GTZ in close cooperation with PNM.  Only 
accredited MFIs will be permitted to participate in the project.  Throughout implementation of the 
Project the MFIs are required to maintain:  (i) a satisfactory financial position and track record; (ii) 
minimum requirements relating to standard operational procedures and external audits; (iii) 
compliance with robust financial reporting and monitoring requirements.
 
Coordination with the Government and Donors 
23. 
Community involvement and cooperation with government are core elements of a 
sustainable approach. GTZ, working jointly with local governments, NGOs and communities 
themselves, will identify those communities most in need.  Furthermore, the project will work 
together with local government to identify ‘champions/facilitators’ who will be involved in 
capacity building interventions and hence will be enabled to assist communities and MSMEs in the 
long run. 
 
24. 
In case of the proposed JRF funded projects, GTZ and IOM will closely coordinate their 
activities and exchange information during project implementation to gain synergies and to avoid 
overlap, particularly in the on-lending activities supported under their respective projects.
14
 
In 
addition, they will maintain coordination with the respective government stakeholders in regards to 
implementation progress, and reporting. 
 
25. 
On the field, the project will maintain contact with the regent level authorities in order to 
keep them up to date on the progress in implementation of activities and to seek assistance, as 
necessary, in resolving the impediments.  To date, TTN has been an important partner in facilitating 
these activities.  However, its mandate is due to expire on July 3, 2008.  This will clearly create a 
void which needs to be addressed.  The RoI authorities (Ministry of Coordination), TTN 
management, and government authorities in Central Java and Yogyakarata are fully aware of this 
issue and are committed to proposing and implementing an appropriate alternative coordination 
mechanism/venue since overall coordination of donor activities is the responsibility of the 
Indonesian authorities and in this case particularly of the provincial governments. 
 
26. 
In addition to this Project, the JRF has awarded funding to IOM for a parallel project.  
While the two projects generally have the same objectives, care has been taken in the design and 
implementation arrangements to minimize overlap.  This has been achieved by ensuring that on-
lending to MSEs under the two projects will be carried out in different locations.  Given that PNM 
will be the apex for both operations, including monitoring, this should not be difficult to ensure.  
Furthermore, while both project provided TA, their approach is different.  The IOM project directs 
most of the TA to MSEs.  Under this Project most TA is focused on building up the capacity of the 
MFIs.  Hence, the two projects are complementary in their impact on long-term capacity building.

 GTZ had IOM have maintained very close cooperation during the course of project preparation.

Projects will have the responsibility to provide visibility of the project and recognizing JRF; 
further socialize the JRF livelihoods project and involve communities in direct communication. 
 
Materials 
ƒ
Notice boards
–contain general information on the livelihood projects in the offices of the 
implementation agency, the MFIs appointed, and partner agencies.   The objective to use 
the notice boards is dual–show transparency of the project and give background 
information on the access to finance (who, what, where, when) as well as other assistance 
available under the livelihood project(s). 
 
ƒ
Stickers
–beneficiaries will receive a sticker with a JRF logo and tagline (i.e. “my business 
runs on trust”–
“usaha saya jalan karena kepercayaan”)
 to be placed at their business 
location to state that they are beneficiaries of the projects.   
 
Socialization

Forums
 
–
to further inform on the livelihoods programs, GTZ and IOM will each conduct 
regular forums for micro, small and medium

 businesses in each sub-district/localities via 
business associations ((KADIN, IWAPI) or the MFIs (BPR, cooperatives).  Where and 
when appropriate these forums will be conducted jointly

GTZ and IOM will manage separate (but similar) complaint handling mechanisms that 
would include SMS hotlines.  Since project locations and themes are different between the two 
15
 GTZ and IOM maintained close cooperation during the course of project preparation.  During implementation 
coordination will be maintained through regular meetings and exchange of reports/information.

 JRF usually develops the merchandise (vest, t-shirts, notepad) and collaterals (fact sheet, brochures, posters).  JRF 
would provide more in the general scope, not specific to the components.

agencies, they will administer the complaints separately and use different hotlines.  This will make 
the system more flexible and quick in responding to complaints coming from communities since 
complaints are channeled directly to the relevant agency. 
 
31. 
On all posters a JRF logo will be included next/near to the agency (GTZ or IOM) logo. The 
two agencies are exploring the possibility of linking this information to the Rekompak website 
(
http://www.rekompakjrf.org
).  The mechanism should also be promoted/posted in the notice 
boards.  
 
32. 
The tracking sheet would include the following: 
 
(a) Date 
(b) Personal information: 
ƒ
Name of person 
ƒ
Mode of contact (sms, email/web) 
ƒ

ARGETING OF 
B
ENEFICIARIES
 
34. 
The Project has three target groups:  (i) micro entrepreneurs who have been affected by the 
earthquake and have not recovered yet; (ii) SMEs and entrepreneurs with viable businesses who are 
unable to service their existing loans to BPRs due to the devastation caused by the earthquake; and 
(iii) MSE enterprises affected by the earthquake. 
 
35. 
Community involvement and cooperation with government, at all levels, are core elements 
of a sustainable approach. GTZ, working jointly with local governments, NGOs and communities 
themselves, will identify those communities most in need.  Furthermore, the project will work 
together with local government to identify “champions/facilitators” who will be involved in 
capacity building interventions and hence will be enabled to assist communities and MSMEs in the 
long run. 
 
Page  15
10
36. 
GTZ, working together with the implementing partners and the affected communities, will 
identify those most in need.  For the first target group, before doing so, however, GTZ will follow a 
process of targeting/selection as follows:  
 
·
Mapping of recovery status of locations/communities and sectors in coordination with 
IOM
18
;
·
verifying the mapping results on a village level together with implementing partners; 
·
in case of positive verification, a needs assessment for assistance by the implementing 
partners based on the request of beneficiaries. 
 
37. 
This process will be carried out according to standard operation procedures agreed upon by 
the implementing partners prior to the assessment.  An ongoing monitoring system will regularly 
check on this.  
 
38. 
Targeted beneficiaries of components II and III of the project are existing customers/clients 
of BPRs.  Hence, the selection with be done jointly by GTZ and the respective BPRs. 
 
39. 
The gender approach is a quality characteristic
 of GTZ’s work in developing countries. 
GTZ has adopted a company-wide gender strategy that takes equal distribution of opportunities 
between women and men into account.  External as well as internal evaluation proves that is has 
been worthwhile in terms of sustainable, result oriented cooperation to address the mainstreaming 
of gender aspects in a targeted and structured way. 
 
40. 
Gender mainstreaming within GTZ has three dimensions, equality within the company, 
implementation of the BMZ (German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development) 
gender equity concept and in the spheres of operation, where gender aspects are embedded in each 
task as it arises, in line with the principles of sustainable development.
19
 
41. 
Against this background a gender perspective has been embedded into the implementation, 
monitoring and evaluation processes of the ongoing GTZ Earthquake Recovery Assistance in DI 
Yogyakarta and Central Java.  Women participation and involvement into both livelihood recovery 
18
 
IOM assessment, eligibility/selection of MSEs for participating in the project will be based on an overall judgment 
and assessment balancing vulnerability with viability, taking into account the following: 
 
·
Focus on the 26 percent most affected of the 100,000 MSEs impacted by the earthquake, directly or indirectly, 
through loss of production facilities, equipment or supporting infrastructure and market and supply chain 
disruption; 
·
Sales or production capacity has dropped considerably below pre-earthquake level; 
·
MSE has not received similar assistance from other sources; 
·
MSE is a previously viable enterprise based on market study and track record; 
·
The project will target MSEs that have potential for generating more employment opportunities; 
·
Priority to businesses that support disadvantaged groups (women, single-headed household, income below 
USD2 a day, physical disability, etc.); 
·
Eligible MSEs are selected by the community based on a vulnerability assessment using the above criteria.

activities as well as training activities for earthquake safe construction has been ensured.  Micro 
credit schemes have been set up with women co-operatives and the majority of beneficiaries are 
female entrepreneurs (33-77 percent).  The ratio of female and male beneficiaries of the micro 
credits via BPRs is almost equal (45-55 percent).  Training courses for earthquake safe construction 
have been delivered to groups of women and men and training for communities always include 
female participants.   
 
42. 
An evaluation of the impact of GTZ’s livelihood activities on women and families for the 
earthquake recovery assistance was undertaken in May 2006.  The findings revealed that the 
project’s activities provided women with equal access to financial and technical assistance.  
Furthermore, it was stressed that the project’s capacity building activities for female entrepreneurs 
had helped them cope with their trauma after the disaster.  Based on the findings a list of 
recommendations was formulated and has been followed up.  For the proposed project GTZ will 
address these issues by integrating gender aspects into: 
 
·
Project design, 
·
Implementation of technical assistance–e.g. selection of supported MSMEs and product 
skills training, 
·
Capacity building for NGOs, Co-operatives and BPRs–e.g. the design of financial 
assistance and SOPs–and 
·
Monitoring and evaluation activities.

ECHANISMS
 
44. 
In order to facilitate disbursements under the project the Implementing Agency and PNM 
have agreed to utilize their own funds for financing of some activities under the project, and to seek 
bank re-imbursement upon submission of documentation verifying the actual expenditures.  To 
facilitate start up of the project, retroactive financing of up to USD 250,000 will be required to 
cover project expenditures incurred during the 2-month period beginning on June 1, 2008. 
 
45. 
Disbursement arrangement.
 The disbursement method would be “Advance and 
Reimbursement” and thus a Designated Account (DA) in Euro will be opened. This DA will be a 
segregated account and solely used to finance eligible expenditure under the project.  The ceiling of 
the advance to the DA is fixed at Euro 500,000. 
20
 While there was a delay in signing the Grant Agreement, it is expected that the JRF will be extended, which would 
allow additional time for project implementation.   
Page  17
12
 
46. 
Reporting of use and replenishment of DA will be made quarterly or when the DA has been 
used by 20 percent, based on (i) list of payment and records against prior-review contracts, (ii) 
statement of expenditures for other expenditures and (iii) reconciliation of DA, including bank 
statement of the DA.  Expenditures under category 5 (overhead) may be claimed in proportion to 
the total disbursement being made.   Eligible expenditures under category 1 (Credits) may be 
reimbursed from the DA when the sub-loan have been provided to the respective MSMEs. 
 
47. 
All documentation evidencing expenditures will be retained by GTZ and shall be made 
available to the auditors for audit and to the Bank and its representatives if requested.

ESPONSIBILITIES
 
Financial Management  
49. 
Financial management risks are rated as ‘moderate’ and these could arise from the 
following factors: (a) the project might be influenced by the weak overall fiduciary environment in 
Indonesia.  In such an environment, a set of fiduciary policies and procedures are needed to ensure 
that proceeds of the grant are used only for the purposes intended, with due regard to economy and 
efficiency; (b) the Jakarta office of GTZ  has adequate financial management staff under its 
administration and finance department.  However, risk may arise from field operation in 
Yogyakarta since staff has not yet appointed; (c) financial assistance to MSMEs will be channelled 
through PNM to partner financial intermediaries (e.g. cooperatives and Bank Perkreditan Rakyat  
“Rural Bank”) that are officially registered and accredited with the GoI and in good standing with 
the regulator. GTZ will request for reimbursement to the Bank based on disbursements by the MFIs 
to the MSMEs.  FM assessment for PNM has not yet been completed, subject to receipt of some 
documentation by PNM (Organization structure and CVs of key finance people). 
 
50. 
 PNM will become Trustee of the fund after completion of the project.  The fund will be 
treated as endowment funds and shall continue to be used to support MSMEs in Yogyakarta and 
Central Java areas.  Since the fund will be granted to PNM, therefore the micro credit fund under 
Page  18
13
this project will be included on its books of account and subject to checks and balances applicable 
to PNM funds. 
 
51. 
Some measures have been proposed to mitigate the risks arising from these factors.  Special 
purpose financial reports will be requested for this operation on a quarterly basis to facilitate 
monitoring.  MOU between GTZ and PNM, complete with detail arrangement of flow of funds, 
accounting treatment and fiduciary control, would be reviewed and agreed by the Bank before grant 
effectiveness.  This FM assessment will need to be revisited once the MOU is signed and the 
arrangements related to disbursement to the MSMEs will be evaluated.  An independent financial 
audit will be carried at the end of fiscal year, together with a review of internal controls over project 
implementation. 
 
52. 
Overall, the project financial management risk is assessed as 
“Moderate.”  This assessment 
has concluded that with the implementation of the action plan, the proposed financial management 
arrangements will satisfy the Bank’s minimum requirements under OP/BP10.02 and are adequate to 
provide, with reasonable assurance, accurate and timely information on the status of the grant 
required by the Bank.  More details of the financial management assessment are given in Annex III. 
 
53. 
A midterm review of project will be carried out no later than 12 months after the Effective 
Date or promptly after an amount representing 50 percent of the Grant have been disbursed under 
the grant, in cooperation with the Central Java and Yogyakarta governments, to review the 
implementation progress.
21
 
Procurement Assessment  
54. 
The Bank has carried out an assessment of GTZ’s procurement capacity for the Project as 
part of the project preparation.  The assessments reviewed the organizational structure for project 
implementation.  Based on the assessment, and taking into account the risk mitigation measures 
(detailed in Annex IV, Procurement), the overall project risk for procurement is rated as “Low.”
 
55. 
Procurement will consist of the purchase of goods and services.  GTZ will procure office 
equipment of small values through Bank’s Shopping procedure.  It has adequate internal 
procurement and purchasing systems and procedures in place to do Shopping.  Procurement for 
goods under Component III of the project (Access to Finance) will be the responsibility of the 
beneficiaries (MSEs) for which local shopping will be used.  The Project will finance one small 
contract for audit firm (less than USD50,000), and several individual consultants contracts for a 
total estimated amount of USD2.45 million.  Selection of consultants will follow procedures in 
Bank’s Consultant Guidelines.  To expedite the Project implementation, GTZ has carried out 
advance selection of some of the individual consultant contracts, and may award contract based on 
provisions for retroactive financing proposed under the Project.  Please refer to further detail of 
procurement under the Project in Annex IV, Procurement.

The exact date and the ToR will be agreed in consultation with GTZ.

Social aspects.  The social impact is expected to be positive, as the project will assist micro, 
small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) affected by the earthquake to revitalize their businesses 
and to re-integrate affected low income communities back into economic life.  The project focuses 
particularly on remote communities which have received little assistance so far.  There will be no 
land acquisition and resettlement expected within the project as the MSMEs affected are not new 
enterprises and hence will not require any new land. 
 
58. 
Environmental aspects.  Environmental impact is part of each project assessment and hence 
already integrated into ongoing GTZ’s existing livelihood recovery activities for DI Yogyakarta 
and Central Java.  Environmental issues that may emerge in the project are: (a) potential 
contamination of surface and or ground water quality from improper effluent disposal or leakage / 
spillage of wastewater and (b) poor solid waste management and housekeeping.    
 
59. 
Selection of supported MSMEs will be screened via a negative list approach and 
environmental screening and assessment will be conducted as a separate activity by experts and 
partners for those sectors supported in the project that potentially create harmful impacts on the 
environment (Further detailed in Annex V).  Training measures for affected micro entrepreneurs so 
far have included environmental aspects, including:  
 
ƒ
Cement roof tiles.  No use of clay from rice fields, no wood needed for burning tiles i.e. 
the roof tiles are produced with cement and hence are not burnt at all and are air dry; 
ƒ
Dyeing of yarn and batik cloth.  Waste water purification system to be set up (in 
cooperation with the Indonesian-German Environmental Programme–ProLH); natural 
dyes to be promoted (already partly in use); 
ƒ
Wood/furniture.  Consequences of illegal logging to be expatiated; environmentally 
friendly wood treatment and varnishes to be promoted and 
Page  20
15
ƒ
Food processing.  Environmentally friendly packaging to be promoted. 
 
60. 
Indonesia’s environmental review procedures are generally consistent with Bank 
requirements.  The potential scale of environmental impacts can be localized, and measures to 
mitigate impacts are manageable.  Annex 5 outlines the environmental screening procedures and 
guidelines to identify, review, “red-flag,” and correct problems. 
 
61. 
For this matter GTZ draws on the expertise of ProLH, which is jointly implemented by the 
Ministry of Environment and the regional environmental institutions (Bapedalda) of Central Java 
and DI Yogyakarta,
22
 which focuses on reducing environmental pollution and health risks of the 
population by improving the industrial environmental management in small and medium scale 
industries.  Within ProLH pilot projects have been established to demonstrate the instruments, 
policy and benefits associated with cleaner production.  Intermediary level organizations like the 
Indonesian Cleaner Production Centre and other networks are used to the effective capacity 
development of the government and private sectors in addressing industrial environmental 
management.  Within the proposed project GTZ will continue to address these issues by integrating 
environmental aspects into: 
 
·
Design of project concept and activities; 
·
Implementation of activities - such as selection of supported MSMEs, and training; 
·
Capacity building for NGOs, Co-operatives and BPRs–such as the design of financial 
assistance; and, 
·
Monitoring and evaluation activities. 
 
GTZ will submit to the Bank on a semi-annual basis reports on the status of compliance with the 
SEMF and SEMP.  
 
XII. A
UDITING
 
62. 
Unaudited interim special purposes project financial statement for expenditure under this 
grant would be prepared by the Jakarta office, based on summary of financial transaction received 
from the Yogyakarta office and transactions occurred in Jakarta office, and submitted to the Bank 
not later than 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter.  The financial report, which will be 
denominated in US dollar, will be subject to financial audit by reputable auditor acceptable to the 
Bank.  The first annual audit to be carried out under the project would cover a one-year period 
beginning from the date of effectiveness of the Grant, and that the second and final audit covering 
the next one-year period would be undertaken at the end of the project implementation period.  A 
copy of the project audited financial statements, along with the management letters issued by the 
auditors, if any, will be submitted to the Bank not later than three  months after the end of fiscal 
year.  The Provincial Governments would receive copies of audits and other reports, on which they 
may well choose to provide comments. 
 
63. 
The draft Terms of Reference (ToR) for the (external) Project audit will be provided to the 
Bank before contracting the auditors for Bank approval.  The audit report will include an opinion 
22

Remedies 
64. 
If ineligible expenditures are found to have been made from the DA, or if expenditures are 
made from the DA without adequate supporting documentation to validate the expenditures, the 
Recipient will be obliged to refund the same to the Bank in accordance with the Grant Agreements. 
 
65. 
The Bank will have the right to suspend disbursement of the funds if significant terms of the 
Grant agreements, including reporting requirements, are not complied with.  This will be reflected 
in the Grant agreement.

GTZ will provide the Bank with quarterly reports on the compiled data of credit users as 
provided by the MFIs.  GTZ will also provide the Bank quarterly reports on the physical and 
financial implementation progress not later than 45 days after the end of the period covered by such 
report. In addition, the Implementing Agency must submit a Completion Report after operational 
aspects of the Project have been completed summarizing the findings of the follow-up surveys of 
the beneficiaries, and details of the procurement, disbursement, and technical assistance stages of 
the project.  The Completion Report shall be furnished to the Bank not later than four months after

XV. S
USTAINABILITY
 
70. 
This is a human investment project, designed to deliver essential financial and technical 
assistance to affected communities and MSMEs.  Project implementation will be embedded within 
existing institutional structures to transfer key methodologies and competencies to these 
institutions.  Thus the project will provide learning opportunities to staff of partner institutions, 
facilitators from local communities and local governments responsible for supporting livelihood 
activities at the community level.   
 
Page  22
17
71. 
Intermediary organizations (Cooperatives, BPRs, Business Development Services and 
Business Associations
23
)
play key roles as provider of either technical or financial assistance or 
both.  By developing capacities the project enhances relevant competencies and improves 
methodological rigor (e.g. in loan appraisal).  
 
72. 
Achieving effective and sustainable function of the respective intermediaries in providing 
ongoing support for SMEs (both technical and financial) is an imp
ortant component of the project’s 
exit strategy.  The project will make full use of GTZ’s existing cooperative relationships with local 
government and financial institutions to maximize the effectiveness of the interventions.  The long–
standing cooperation and ongoing joint programs between GTZ, Bank Indonesia (BI–the central 
bank) and the GoI–in particular the National Planning Agency (BAPPENAS), the Regional/Local 
Planning Agency (BAPPEDA) and the Ministry of Industry (DEPERIN) will result in 
complementarities, such as the GTZ Programme on Regional Economic Development (RED) 
enhances a conducive business environment and works towards the improvement of the regulatory 
framework for MSMEs in Central Java; the GTZ Program on Promotion of Small Financial 
Institutions (ProFI) supports the development of a coherent policy and strategy and a conducive 
legal and regulatory framework for micro finance institutions in Indonesia. 
 
73. 
Institutional development is promoted by engaging government agencies where possible.  
Participation of the government in project implementation encourages accountability, builds 
capacity, and makes possible continued government assistance to target groups.  In addition, the 
local MFIs and PNM will benefit both financially and institutionally from participation the project.  
The funds repaid from the on-lending activities under Component III will continue to be used by 
PNM to provide support to the MSEs through qualified MFIs.  To this end, PNM will enter into an 
agreement with the governments of Central Java and Yogyakarta for utilization of these funds in 
the two provinces beyond the life of the project.

Project Outcome Indicators
26
 
Use of Project Outcome Information 
Contribute to the GoI’s initiatives to assist 
MSMEs affected by the earthquake to 
revitalize their businesses and to re-integrate 
affected low income communities back into 
economic life. 
1) 10,000 assisted MSMEs restore 
their income to pre-earthquake 
level 
2) 500 debtors/SMEs re-establish 
their creditworthiness and the 
participating BPRs improve their 
portfolio quality 
3)  45 assisted medium-sized 
enterprises increase employment 
 
Determine during the mid-term review if 
project assistance strategies/activities 
need adjustment.  
Baseline data collection see below 
Intermediate Outcomes 
Intermediate Outcome 
Indicators 
Use of Intermediate Outcome 
Monitoring 
Component I   
Enhanced MSEs access to  finance linked to 
technical assistance contributes to an 
increase in their income. 
 
1) MSEs increase their net 
business income 6 – 12 months 
after loan disbursement. 
 
1) Baseline: date of loan disbursement / 
date of participating in training activity 
2) Financial institutions report on use 
of funds by debtors based on individual 
loan implementation reports.  
3) BPR and cooperatives conduct debtor 
income analysis after loan repayment, but 
latest 12 months after loan disbursement, 
and report to Project. 
Component II 
Defaulting-loan “work-out” strategies 
reduce the number of NPLs, increase the 
capacity of/strengthen MFIs to provide 
loans, and enhance SMEs access to new 
finance.
 
1) 500 BPR debtors /SMEs 
without any loan service or with 
irregular loan service repay their 
loan and hence restore their 
creditworthiness (e.g. sales of 
assets, other sources of funds) or 
resume regular loan service and 
re-establish their credit 
worthiness. 
2) Strengthening MFI:  
The number of NPL caused by the 
earthquake drops. Participating 
focus BPR increase the actual 
loan portfolio quality. 
 
1) Baseline: BPRs report on their loan 
portfolio when applying for funds from 
PNM 
2) Quarterly BPR report on number of 
loan recovery proposals. 
3) Quarterly BPR report on number of 
renewed contracts. 
4) Loan portfolio quality scoring based 
on BI’s rating system (collectability) of 
focus BPR 
 
25
 Due to delay in signing the Grant Agreement, the performance indicators might not be fully achieved. However, it is 
expected that the JRF will be extended, which would allow additional time for project implementation.    
26
 The indicator base values and targets will be presented after Grant signature.   The number of indicators might be 
adjusted at time of the mid-term review subject to prior approval of the JRF Committee and the Bank management.

Enhanced MEs access to finance linked to 
technical assistance contributes to increased 
employment. 
45 assisted medium-sized 
enterprises increase employment 
(including employment in value 
chain),

hen granting loans:  
·
The overall number of 
female/male credit users is 
monitored by financial 
intermediaries.  
·
In case of credits for couples 
both wife and husband must 
sign loan application.  
30% of overall number of credit 
users is female
 
Financial institutions report on number of 
female/male applicants for credits and 
actual credit users.

Project targets and delivery 
schedule met 
 
Monitoring overall project progress and 
specific deliverables to determine 
efficiency of project coordination.  
Adjustment made to ensure project 
targets and milestones are met.  
Definitions 
.
·
Non-
performing loans (NPL) refer to those loans that were rated “sound” before May 27, 2006 (date of 
earthquake), but arrears since then classify them as NPL, despite a special BI regulation allowing BPR to record 
these loans as PL.

Summary 
 
1. 
This project objective is to assist micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) affected 
by the earthquake to revitalize their businesses and to re-integrate affected low income 
communities back into economic life.  The project focuses particularly on remote communities 
which have received little assistance so far. Total budget estimate is USD10.75 million
 
and will be 
implemented in 24 months.  This grant will be funded by several donors, under a multi-donor trust 
fund. 
 
2. 
The purpose of the project’s financial management assessment is to determine whether the 
grant recipient, GTZ (Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer Technische Zusammenarbeit) has acceptable 
financial management arrangements, including accounting system, reporting, auditing and internal 
controls. GTZ is a German federally owned international cooperation enterprise for sustainable 
development with headquarters in Eschborn, Germany.  Financial management system in 
headquarters has not been assessed for this Grant. 
 
3. 
Financial management risks are rated as ‘moderate’ and these could arise from the 
following factors: (a) the project might be influenced by the weak overall fiduciary environment in 
Indonesia.  In such an environment, a set of fiduciary policies and procedures are needed to ensure 
that proceeds of the grant are used only for the purposes intended, with due regard to economy and 
efficiency; (b) the Jakarta office of GTZ  has adequate financial management staff under its 
administration and finance department.  However, risk may arise from field operation in 
Yogyakarta since staff has not yet appointed; (c) financial assistance to MSMEs will be channelled 
through PNM to partner financial intermediaries (e.g. cooperatives and Bank Perkreditan Rakyat  
“Rural Bank”) that are officially registered and accredited with the GoI and in good standing with 
the regulator. GTZ will request for reimbursement to the Bank based on disbursements by the MFIs 
to the MSMEs.  FM assessment for PNM has not yet been completed, subject to receipt of some 
documentation by PNM (Organization structure and CVs of key finance people). 
 
4. 
PNM will become Trustee of the fund after completion of the project.  The fund will be 
treated as endowment funds and shall continue to be used to support MSMEs in Yogyakarta and 
Central Java areas. Since the fund will be granted to PNM, therefore the micro credit fund under 
this project will be included on its books of account and subject to checks and balances applicable 
to PNM funds. 
 
5. 
Some measures have been proposed to mitigate the risks arising from these factors.  Special 
purpose financial reports will be requested for this operation on a quarterly basis to facilitate 
monitoring.  MOU between GTZ and PNM, complete with detail arrangement of flow of funds, 
accounting treatment and fiduciary control, would be reviewed and agreed by the Bank before grant 
effectiveness.  This FM assessment will need to be revisited once the MOU is signed and the 
arrangements related to disbursement to the MSMEs will be evaluated.  An independent financial 
Page  32
27
audit will be carried at the end of fiscal year, together with a review of internal controls over project 
implementation. 
 
6. 
Overall, the project financial management risk is assessed as 
“Moderate.”  This assessment 
has concluded that with the implementation of the action plan, the proposed financial management 
arrangements will satisfy the Bank’s minimum requirements under OP/BP10.02 and are adequate to 
provide, with reasonable assurance, accurate and timely information on the status of the grant 
required by the Bank. More details of the financial management assessment are given below. 
 
Summary of Risks and Proposed Mitigation Arrangements 
 
7. 
The project’s overall risk assessment and summary of mitigation measures is as follows: 
 
Risks 
Assessment 
Summary Comments & Risk Mitigation Measures 
Conditionality 
Rating after 
Mitigation 
A. Inherent Risks
 
1. Country 
Level Risks 
Substantial 
This operation will not rely on Government financial 
management systems.  Fiduciary risks normally 
associated with use of Government FM systems will 
therefore not apply. But the wide prevalence of 
corruption in the country will impact the control 
environment to some degree. 
N
2. Entity 
Specific Risks
 
GTZ has extensive experience in Indonesia for more 
than 30 years, with operations in Central Java, 
Yogyakarta, East and West Nusa Tenggara and Aceh. 
 
a. Implementing 
Entity 
Organization 
Low 
GTZ is a federal enterprise and founded in 1975. The 
German Federal Ministry for Economic Operation and 
Development (BMZ) is its major client. Income is 
mostly from BMZ and total business volume in 2006 is 
EUR1, 005 million globally. 
N
b. Entity 
Governance & 
Audit 
Arrangements 
Moderate 
The audit of GTZ 2006 financial statement is 
conducted by PWC with Unqualified opinion. 
Governance arrangements from HQ are strong. 
N
Overall Entity 
Specific Risk 
Moderate 
Moderate 
B. Control Risks
 
1. Budgeting
 
Moderate 
Final version of budget for the project has been 
received. Changes were made due to extension of 
project period by three months, and contingency in 
case of devaluation of USD against EUR during 
implementation. In total revised budget was increased 
by 9 percent compared to original budget.  
 
Revised budget will be approved before GA signing.
 
Page  33
28
2. Internal 
Controls
 
Moderate 
FM procedures and policies are well documented. 
Transactions in Indonesia are subject to periodic 
internal audit performed by local staff with more than 
20 years of experience. Report submitted to relevant 
project, country office and HQ. There are different 
a
uthorization for payment validation, depends on value 
of transactions. For transactions above EUR 2,500, 
procurement arrangements and payments will be 
processed through Jakarta office. 
 
N
3. Accounting
 
Substantial 
Accounting staff capacity in Jakarta is adequate. Risks 
may arise from the field operation in Yogyakarta since 
staff not yet appointed.  Support will be given by 
Jakarta office and HQ.  
Key finance staff of PNM has not yet completely 
assessed, pending of some documentation not yet 
provided by PNM. 
Micro-credit received by PNM and transferred to MFIs 
would be recorded under PNM financial system, only if 
the fund granted to PNM. 
 
Transactions
 
for proposed Grant operation will be 
included in their entity accounting system and final 
booking will be done in Jakarta based on original 
transaction evidence received from Yogya office. This 
project will be included in GTZ Indonesia internal 
audit program. 
 
N
Page  34
29
4.  Flow of Fund
 
Substantial 
Payment to consultant will be centralized from Jakarta 
office. Risk may arise from financial assistance to 
MSMEs, since it will be channeled through PNM to 
financial intermediaries. Financial intermediaries are 
officially registered and accredited with the GoI and in 
g
ood standing with the regulator. 
PNM is a state owned enterprise, established for the 
specific purpose of development and empowering 
MSME in Indonesia. FM assessment has been done for 
PNM, but not yet completed, pending of some 
documentation not yet provided by PNM. GTZ will 
request for reimbursement to the Bank based on 
disbursement by MFIs to MSMEs. Previously, GTZ 
and PNM have working together for similar project 
(ProFi 
–
Promotion of Small Financial Institution). 
 
PNM will consider the micro credit fund as an off-
balance sheets item, unless the fund is granted to them. 
This FM assessment assumed that the money will be 
granted to PNM.  
 
Micro-credit fund received from this grant will  be 
included in the PNM financial management system. 
MOU between GTZ and PNM should clearly define 
flow of funds, accounting treatment and terms and 
conditions to be applied to ensure fiduciary control by 
PNM.   
 
MOU should be approved by the Bank before project 
effectiveness.

Moderate 
5. Audit 
Arrangements
 
Moderate 
For current projects in Indonesia, GTZ appointed PWC 
Philippines as their auditor. For this project, 
independent private audit firms will be hired, 
acceptable to the Bank, based on ToR acceptable to the 
Bank. The audit will be for financial transaction in 
Indonesia under this Grant.  
Audit of the Special Purpose Financial Statements 
will be submitted to the Bank not later than 6 months 
after the end of fiscal year.

Project Financial Management and Disbursement Arrangements 
8. 
Based on the project design features and the risk analysis summarized above, the following 
arrangements are proposed for financial management and disbursements.  These include measures 
to mitigate risks identified above. 
 
Institutional and Staffing Arrangements 
 
9. 
GTZ is the implementing agency for the technical cooperation between the Federal 
Republic of Germany and its partner countries (including Indonesia).  It has been in operation in 
Indonesia since its establishment in 1975.  In Indonesia, it is governed by Technical Co-operation 
agreements between the two governments signed on 9 April 1984.  GTZ-IS (International Services) 
Page  35
30
in Indonesia currently implements projects on behalf of the European Commission (EC), the Asian 
Development Bank (ADB) and the German Research Institution GeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam.  
GTZ office in Jakarta is a regional office, covering the area of Indonesia, East Timor, the 
Philippines, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands with 14 field staff. 
 
10. 
Finance and accounting staff for the project in Yogyakarta will do accounting, reporting and 
monitoring.  The staff has not yet selected, but GTZ had staff at location for a similar project 
(ProFI
–Promotion of Small Financial Institutions) which was closed in March 2008.  This staff 
may take up the job for this project.  Activities will be supervised by Jakarta office of GTZ.  
Administration and Finance department has responsibility on financial management. Two 
accountants and a cashier will be hired for the project, in addition to an accountant and an 
International Finance Manager located in Jakarta office.  Financial Controller from HQ will also 
monitor this project. This arrangement is considered adequate for the time being. 
 
Accounting and Reporting 
 
11. 
GTZ Jakarta uses WINPACCS accounting system to records transactions.  Data will be 
input electronically from cashbook/bankbook to WINPACCS.  Same source also used for SAP and 
AMS. SAP system is used for world wide consolidation reporting purposes in headquarters office, 
while AMS is used for project monitoring, where it can be tailored to accommodate clients’ 
reporting requirement. AMS report compares budget to actuals. 
 
12. 
Yogyakarta office will record transactions using electronic cashbook and bankbook.  The 
data then will be exported and sent electronically to Jakarta office.  The Jakarta office will be 
responsible for importing data into WINPACCS and doing the final bookings based on original 
vouchers received from Yogya office.  The project will use their existing accounting system. All 
project transactions will be included in its financial statement. 
 
Internal Controls 
 
13. 
GTZ has good internal control in place concerning the preparation and approval of 
transactions and segregation of duties.  FM procedures and policies are well documented.  For 
transactions above EUR 2,500, procurement arrangements and payments will be done through 
Jakarta office.  Transactions above EUR 12,500 have to be made through HQ. 
 
14. 
Projects in Indonesia are subject to periodic internal audit performed by local staff with 
experience more than 20 years in his field.  They regularly review the projects through desk 
supervision and at least twice a year conduct field visit to verify activities.  The internal audit report 
is submitted to HQ, country office and the relevant project for follow up. This project will be 
included in internal audit program. 
 
Flow of Funds (PNM FM Assessment) 
 
15. 
Risk may arise from financial assistance to MSMEs, since it will be channelled through 
PNM to financial intermediaries before it finally reaches the beneficiaries of the grant (MSMEs). 
 
Page  36
31
16. 
PNM is a State-owned enterprise, established for the specific purpose of development and 
empowering MSMEs in Indonesia.  PNM was established by the Government of Indonesia in June 
1999, based on IMF’s Letter of Intent dated 16 March 1999, Decree of the People’s Consultative 
Assembly (Tap XVI MPR/1998) and Government Regulation no. 38/1999.  The notary deed of 
establishment dated 1 June 1999 was validated by the Minister of Justice in Decree No. C-
11.609.HT.01.01.TH 99 dated 23 June 1999. 
 
17. 
Credit to financial intermediaries (MFIs–BPRs and cooperatives) is processed through PNM 
branch in Yogyakarta.  The branch has authority to approve credit up to Rp500 million. Above that 
limit, approval has to be given by Head Office (Jakarta).  Disbursement is made directly from Head 
Office to the bank account of financial intermediaries.  MFIs transfer credit repayments to Head 
Office bank account. PNM will open a new bank account in government’s owned bank (BNI or 
BRI) for this grant.  MFIs submit monthly financial reports to the Branch office for monitoring 
purposes.  Branch office prepares and submits periodic report to Credit Committee, including any 
repayment failures by MFIs. 
 
18. 
PNM uses Great Plain accounting system to record transactions and produce financial 
reports.  Bank reconciliations are conducted on monthly basis.  For micro-credit fund under this 
grant, records will be maintained only in Head Office, as all funds will be transferred and received 
through Head Office bank account.  Assessment of key financial staff has not yet been completed, 
as some documentation is to be provided by PNM. 
 
19. 
PNM has its own Internal Audit Unit consisting of 5 staff reporting to the President 
Director.  Annually, internal audit performed in Head Office and a sample of 5 to 6 branches 
selected from 13 branches.  In addition to Internal Audit Unit, PNM also has Supervision Unit with 
staff located in Head Office and Branch offices, responsible for continuous monitoring and 
relationship with the MFIs.  Each supervisor is given a mandate to supervise and monitor at least 20 
MFIs in one particular region. 
 
20. 
The audit of PNM 2006 financial statement was conducted by Tasnim Ali Widjanarko & 
Rekan with Unqualified opinion. 
 
21. 
PNM is working together currently with GTZ in similar project (ProFi–Promotion of Small 
Financial Institution). Ownership of the fund after ProFi project is completed is not decided–the 
fund will be granted to PNM or to the community. 
 
22. 
PNM will become Trustee of the micro credit fund after the project completed.  The fund 
will be treated as endowment funds and shall continue to be used to support MSMEs in Yogyakarta 
and Central Java areas. 
 
23. 
Since the micro credit fund will be granted to PNM, which will become the owner of the 
funds and therefore the micro-credit fund will be included in its books of account and subject to 
checks and balances applicable to PNM funds. 
 
Page  37
32
Audit Arrangements 
24. 
Special purposes project financial statement for expenditure under this grant would be 
prepared by the Jakarta office, based on summary of financial transaction received from the 
Yogyakarta office and transactions that take place in Jakarta office.  The financial report will be 
subject to a financial audit by qualified auditor acceptable to the Bank.  A copy of the audited 
financial statements for the project, along with the management letters issued by the auditors, if 
any, not later than three  months after the end of fiscal year.  The provincial governments would 
receive copies of audits and other reports, on which they may well choose to provide comments 
 
25. 
The Terms of Reference for the project audit will be agreed by the Bank with the Recipient 
before contracting an audit firm.  The audit report will include an opinion on the reliability of the 
project financial statements.  
 
Disbursement Arrangement  
 
26. 
The disbursement method would be “Advance and Reimbursement” and thus a Designated 
Account (DA) in Euro will be opened.  This DA will be a segregated account and solely used to 
finance eligible expenditure under the project.  The ceiling of the advance to the DA is fixed at 
Euro 500,000. 
 
27. 
Reporting of use and replenishment of DA will be made quarterly or when the DA has been 
used by 20 percent, based on:  (i) list of payment and records against prior-review contracts; (ii) 
statement of expenditures for other expenditures; and (iii) reconciliation of DA, including bank 
statement of the DA.  Expenditures under category 5 (overhead) may be claimed in proportion to 
the total disbursement being made. Eligible expenditures under category 1 (Credits) may be 
reimbursed from the DA when the sub-loan have been provided to the respective MSMEs. 
 
28. 
All documentation evidencing expenditures will be retained by GTZ and shall be made 
available to the auditors for audit and to the Bank and its representatives if requested. 
 
29.

ROCUREMENT
 
A. General 
 
1. The 
Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit
(GTZ) Jakarta Office will carry out 
procurement for the proposed project in accordance with the World Bank’s “Guidelines: 
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits” dated May 2004, and revised in October 2006; 
and “Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers” dated May 
2004, and revised in October 2006, and the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreements.  This 
section describes general description of various items under different expenditure category.  The 
Procurement Plan provides detail descriptions of contracts to be financed by the Grant, the different 
procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need for prequalification, estimated 
costs, prior review requirements, and time frame based on agreement between GTZ and the Bank 
project team.  GTZ will update the Procurement Plan at least annually or as required to reflect the 
actual project implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity. 
 
2. 
Procurement of Goods:
 
GTZ will procure low-valued office equipment consisting of IT 
equipment its peripherals.  Each contract value will be very small (less than USD100,000), and the 
total aggregate amount is less than USD250,000, hence GTZ will carry out procurement using 
Shopping procedures. 
 
3. 
Selection of Consultants:  
The Project will finance one small contract for audit firm 
(USD26,000) and contracts for individual technical advisors (USD2.4 millions) throughout the 
Project’s implementation (21 months).  There will be four contracts for individual experts with 
international experience, twelve individual consultants with local experience and twelve field 
workers from NGO.  In addition, there will be two short-term consultants with international 
experience who will work on a daily basis, and three individual consultants to assist management of 
the Project.  Selection of audit firm will follow provisions in paragraph 3.7 and 3.8 and other 
relevant paragraphs of the Bank’s Consultant Guidelines for Consultants’ Qualifications Selection 
(CQS) method.  Due to the size of the contract, GTZ may compare qualifications of local 
consultant firms or local branch of consultants with international reputation.  Selection of 
Individual consultants will follow provisions in Section V of the Bank’s Consultant Guidelines. 
Short list of consultants with local experience, and which costs less than USD400,000 equivalent 
per contract may consist entirely of national consultants in accordance with the provisions of 
paragraph 2.7 of the Consultant Guidelines.  To expedite the Project’s implementation, GTZ may 
carry out advance selection of several key individual consultants.  The Agreement will include 
provisions on retroactive financing in case the above contracts are awarded prior to Grant’s 
effectiveness.  Such advance selection shall be done according to provisions in the Guidelines, and 
will be subject to prior review as specified in the Procurement Plan. 
 
4. 
Operational Costs:
 
GTZ will hire administrative and support staffs, rent office and pay for 
running costs and transportation related to the Project’s activities under the operational costs 
budget.  Total estimated amount is about [USD800,000 to be updated during negotiations] 
Page  40
35
 
B. 
Assessment of the Agency’s Capacity to Implement Procurement  
 
5. 
The implementing agency (IA) is the GTZ Indonesia Office.  The Designated Procurement 
Specialist (DPS) from EAPCO has carried out assessments of GTZ’s procurement capacity for the 
Project as part of the project preparation.  The assessments reviewed the organizational structure for 
project implementation.  An assessment report is available in the project files. 
6. 
The main procurement related risks identified and the mitigation measures adopted are 
summarized below: 
 
·
To mitigate the risk associated with lack of knowledge of Bank’s Procurement procedures, 
the Bank has met with GTZ’s staffs and provided general overview of these procedures, 
especially the ones related to contracts under the Project.  This should be sufficient due to 
the simple nature of these procurements.  In addition, this assessment could not identify any 
principle differences between GTZ’s procurement procedures and the Bank’s. 
 
·
To mitigate the risk associated with limited advertisement of procurement opportunity, i.e. 
limited to GTZ’s website or local media and with local language, GTZ should ensure that 
for certain position and contract amount, such advertisement is also available in English and 
in other media or publicly accessible website.  GTZ will also ensure that selection of 
individual consultant on a sole-source basis, if any proposed, shall meet justifications in the 
Guidelines. 
 
7. 
Procurement under the Project is straightforward involving small-valued consulting firm 
contract, contracts for individual consultants, and small-valued goods procurement.  Based on the 
above, and taking into account the risk mitigation measures, the overall project risk for 
procurement is rated as “Low.” 
 
C. Procurement 
Plan 
 
8. 
A Procurement Plan has been developed and discussed between GTZ and the Bank Project 
Team based on a detailed costs table.  GTZ will send official draft Procurement Plan for Bank’s 
review prior to the negotiation.  Once finalized, the Procurement Plan will be available in the 
Project’s database and in the Bank’s external website.  GTZ will update the Procurement Plan in 
agreement with the Project Team annually or as required to reflect the actual project 
implementation needs. 
 
D. 
Frequency of Procurement Supervision 
 
9. 
Due to its value, most contracts will be subject to ex-post review.  The Bank will carry out 
prior review selection of individual consultants only on an exceptional case, which includes high-
valued individual consultant contracts and selection on a sole-source basis.  The World Bank Office 
Jakarta will carry out monitoring and supervision as part of the regular project supervision missions 
for at least once a year. 
Page  41
36
 
E. 
Details of the Procurement Arrangements 
 
1. Goods 
 
GTZ will follow Shopping procedures for the purchase of office equipment (IT equipment 
and its peripherals) with an estimated cost of USD100,000 for each contract, and an 
aggregate amount of less than USD250,000. 
 
2. Consulting Services
.
a)  There will be one consultant firm (audit firm) package of small-value selected by CQS 
method under the Project.  GTZ expects to hire a local branch or partner of an audit 
firm with good international reputation.   
b)  All selection of consultants on a sole-source basis, if any, will be subject to prior 
review by the Bank. 
c)  Short lists composed entirely of national consultants:  Not expected at the time of 
project appraisal.  However, if need arises during project implementation and justified, 
short lists of consultants for services estimated to cost less than USD400,000 
equivalent per contract may be composed entirely of national consultants in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.7 of the Consultant Guidelines.

Introduction 
 
1. 
The overall objective of the project is to contribute to the Government’s of Indonesia’s 
initiatives to assist micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) affected by the earthquake to 
revitalized their businesses and to re-integrate affected low income communities back into 
economic life.  The project focuses particularly on remote communities which have received little 
assistance so far. 
 
Objectives of the Safeguard Framework 
 
2. 
The social and environmental management framework provides general policies and 
guidelines to serve the following objectives: 
 
·
Protect human health; 
·
Prevent or compensate any loss of livelihood; 
·
Prevent environmental degradation as a result of either individual investments or their 
cumulative effects; 
·
Enhance positive environmental outcomes; 
·
Avoid or minimize adverse environmental, economic and social impacts. 
 
3. 
The project is considered to be equivalent to World Bank “Category FI,” recognizing that 
the project will finance a number of subprojects where most environmental impacts are likely to be 
localized, short term and reversible..  
 
Environmental Screening 
 
4. 
MSMEs will be checked against Government of Indonesia (GOI) screening criteria to 
ensure that no project would necessitate a full environmental assessment.  In an initial screening, 
the project type, scale, location, sensitivity, and the nature and magnitude of potential impacts, will 
be identified to classify the proposal in one of 4 categories: 
 
·
Any potential MSMEs which fall into the World Bank's Category A and thus require 
preparation of a full EIA (AMDAL) for which the Ministry of Environment has set criteria will 
be excluded from project funding.  AMDALs (environmental impact assessments) are required 
for large sub-projects in the following areas: marine/freshwater conservation areas, peat areas, 
water catchment areas surrounding lakes and reservoirs, areas surrounding springs, scientific 
areas, areas susceptible to natural hazards, coastal mangrove areas, coastal edges, forest 
protected areas, and cultural reserves.  No MSMEs are expected and will be allowed in national 
parks, forest parks, or nature tourism parks.   
·
Those which fall into the World Bank's Category B but under the current Indonesian EIA 
System would require the preparation of site-specific Environmental Management (UKL) and 
Monitoring Plans (UPL) are also subject to BAPEDALDA reviews and approvals, with copies 
Page  43
38
furnished to the Bank. It is expected that some small or medium industries may fall under this 
category in particular the medium industries. 
·
Those for which standard operating procedures (SOP) suffice, where generic good practice 
would protect the environment adequately.  The Minister of Environment through ProLH 
program has developed activities on eco efficiency in small and medium sized enterprises and  
disseminated eco efficiency tools (good housekeeping, chemical management, environmental 
oriented cost management, environmental management accounting).  It is expected that some 
MSMEs may fall under this category. 
·
Those that require no environmental study, where no disturbance of land or water or discharge 
of pollutants is involved.  It is expected that most of the MSMEs may fall under this category. 
 
5. 
Special screening will be applied on the following cases: 
 
·
Pesticide, ozone-depleting substances, tobacco or tobacco products:  No subprojects using or 
producing these materials will be financed. 
·
Asbestos.  No asbestos-containing materials will be financed.  Special mitigation measures to 
address any issues with existing asbestos in any proposed sub-project (e.g. renovation of school 
buildings that may have used asbestos) will be applied.  
·
Sub-projects that produce liquid or gaseous effluents or emissions.  No manufacturing or 
processing operations will be financed that would produce pollutant-bearing effluents or 
emissions unless: (a) the operations are small-scale; and (b) the cognizant Bapedalda reviews 
the design and certifies that it meets applicable water and air pollution control standards. 
·
Hazardous materials and wastes.  No MSME will be financed that uses, produces, stores or 
transports hazardous materials (toxic, corrosive or explosive) or generates "B3" (hazardous) 
wastes. 
·
Logging.  MSMEs involving logging operations or procurement of logging equipment will not 
be financed. 
·
MSMEs or activities with the potential for significant conversion or degradation of critical 
forest areas or related critical natural habitats (as defined in OP 4.36 on Forests)   
·
Mining or excavation of live coral. 
 
6. 
The implementing agency will be responsible for ensuring that the negative list approach is 
applied, and that revisions are made to the list, as necessary. 
 
Training 
 
7. 
The Ministry of Environment with the support of GTZ through the joint project ProLH 
(Indonesian-German Environmental Program) developed activities on eco efficiency in small and 
medium-sized enterprises.  In addition, this program initiated the establishment of the Indonesian 
Cleaner Production Center (ICPC) in 2004 in order to stimulate the development of the Cleaner 
Production (CP) and Eco Efficiency (EE) market.  The ICPC is stimulating, facilitating and 
catalyzing Eco Efficiency implementation by supporting service providers in Indonesia.  The ICPC 
is acting as a platform for Eco Efficiency, providing training, awareness-raising events, knowledge 
management, and demonstration projects targeting local service providers.  Currently it cooperates 
with three regional CP centers, namely P3BD (regional cleaner Production Development Center in 
Semarang Jawa Tengah), Forum Eko Efisiensi D.I. Yogjakarta (Ecoforum Yogyakarta), and CPCU 
Page  44
39
(Cleaner Production Clinic UnMul, East Kalimantan). 
 
8. 
Training measures are offered in the following fields: 
 
·
Good Housekeeping  
·
Chemical Management  
·
Occupational health and Safety  
·
Environmental Management (Accounting and Environmental performance 
Assessment/Indicators)  
·
Cleaner Production (CP) General & Communication  
·
CP Marketing strategy  
·
CP and Banking  
 
9. 
Quite a number of eco efficiency measures decrease costs (energy saving, e.g. more fuel 
efficient kilns for the ceramics industries) or increase profits in other ways.  GTZ will employ the 
services of ICPC and its service providers to train loan officers to identify and finance these win-
win constellations.  At the same time, when entrepreneurs replace their earthquake-damaged or -
destroyed assets, loan officers together with MSME should pay attention to that new investments 
will be more environment-friendly. 
 
Reporting 
 
10. 
The implementing agency will aggregate and review environmental reports and flag them in 
their bi-annual reports.  The project manual will include a matrix of likely environmental impacts 
and steps with which to address them.  An experienced environmental consultant will be hired to 
summarize progress, monitor and measure the impact of the project on the environment as part of 
the performance evaluation of the project.  The Implementing Agency will prepare bi-annual 
environmental summary reports to be submitted in English to the World Bank.  This report would 
include: 
 
·
A
summary of significant mitigation measures, if any, undertake during the previous six 
months; 
·
A
description of any significant problems or successes in environmental mitigation during the 
period; and  
·
Anticipated notable environmental or social events anticipated during the coming six months.

1. 
The project components and implementation arrangements are as follows: 
 
2. 
Component/Theme I.  Access to finance linked to technical assistance for MSEs  
(USD 
4.58 million
).
 
Under this component the recipient will provide credits and technical assistance to 
eligible MSEs through the PNM (as the Apex) and a number of partner financial institutions, such 
as cooperatives BPRs.  Technical assistance will also be available to the partner financial 
institutions.  All are officially registered and accredited with the GoI and in good standing with the 
regulator (e.g. Bank of Indonesia).  It is expected that up to about 10 cooperatives and 40 BPRs 
would participate in the project.
27
 
3. 
The size of the credits would range from about USD20-500 equivalent for loans from non-
bank MFIs and about USD500-2,500 for loans from BPR.  Financial intermediaries will take the 
credit risk on all financing.  Cooperatives and NGOs will be responsible for the implementation of 
basic entrepreneurial skills trainings through field officers.  Business Development Service 
Providers and individual experts will undertake skills training activities. Vocational training 
institutes are also available to offer in-house or on-the-spot training. 
 
GTZ’s Approach 
 
a)  Financial assistance 
4. 
Cooperatives and accredited community-based micro-finance institutions are responsible for 
implementing small, community-based credit/savings schemes.  Based on set criteria (e.g. 
redemption capacity, potential for development) the project will provide financial assistance for 
these micro credit schemes, with credits typically ranging from IDR 200,000 to 5 million (USD20-
500 equivalent).  Loan disbursements and impact on the beneficiary will be closely monitored 
throughout the duration of the intervention. 
 
5. 
MSMEs eligible for loans must comply fully with the rules and regulations of the assigned 
cooperative or NGO. The latter require exclusively to women.  Experience shows that a repayment 
rate of 98 percent can be achieved. 
 
6. 
BPRs/BPRS provide credits to MSMEs with particular potential for business growth, and to 
self-help groups.  For this purpose participating BPRs/BPRS who are assessed as sound and signal 
a
specific demand for loan fund resources through PNM are provided access to special refinancing 
lines.  Technical assistance and capacity development measures would be provided at the level of 
PNM
28
,
the apex banks, recipient BPRs and group leaders of borrowing self help groups (SHGs).  
27
 The number of participating BPR is estimated based on the total number of BPR operating in the affected region 
(Special District Yogyakarta and south eastern part of the Central Java province), and adjusted by an estimated number 
of BPR not qualified and not interested in the participation in the proposed schemes. These estimates are also based on 
the experience gained when selecting BPR participating in the GTZ-supported scheme. 
28
 
PNM (PT. Permodalan Nasional Madani (Persero)) is a parastatal financial institution engaged in providing capacity 
building assistance to Indonesian financial institutions, and also permitted to lend to them: PNM branched off from the 
central bank more than a decade ago, and now operates as a non-bank. 
Page  46
41
 
(b)  Technical assistance 
7. 
Based on GTZ’s experience with business recovery assistance, MSMEs very often not only 
lack access to capital, but also do not have appropriate enterprise and/or product skills to manage 
and build a sustainable business.  The project will enable the NGOs and cooperatives to 
complement the financial assistance with a number of technical assistance interventions: 
 
8. Entrepreneurship 
skills
 
training will be provided at several levels according to needs and 
abilities of the entrepreneurs and will address basic financial planning tools, quality control and 
marketing training.  It will help the producers to explore the business potential and effectively 
market their products.  
 
9. 
Whenever specific needs for skills improvement are identified, product skills training will 
be provided.  Such training will include training on product quality, use and handling of new raw 
materials, improvement of product finishing, introduction of more efficient/environmentally 
friendly manufacturing processes and assistance for the development of new product designs.  
 
10. 
Both re-establishing access to markets as well as exploring new markets is another focus of 
technical assistance for MSMEs.  Attending local trade fairs as well as direct marketing are 
effective in this regard.  
 
11. 
Efficiency will be achieved through analysis and development of value chains.  This 
includes measures to reduce production costs, provide good quality raw materials as well as the 
establishment of linkages among supported producers. 
 
12. 
Cooperatives and NGOs will be responsible for the implementation of basic entrepreneurial 
skills trainings through field officers.  Business Development Service Providers (BDS-P) and 
individual experts will undertake skills training activities.  Vocational training institutes are also 
available to offer in-house or on-the-spot training. 
 
13. 
Component/Theme II
–Defaulting loan “work-out” strategy for viable enterprises 
(
USD1.98 million).
 
Under this component the project will assist eligible SMEs whose loans with 
BPRs are in arrears to renegotiate/work-out the loans.  Selected BPRs (40 expected) and PNM will 
receive capacity building technical assistance.  Technical assistance will also be provided to the 
SMEs in preparation of business plans and prove long-term viability and credit-worthiness.  In 
cases where fresh financing is needed, project funds will be available to the BPRs for onlending to 
the SMEs.  The size of the credits would range from USD500-3,500 equivalent.  Financial 
intermediaries will take the credit risk on all financing. 
Page  47
42
GTZ’s Approach 
 
Stage One: Preparation  
 
ƒ
Identification of interested local BPR/BPRS in the affected regions, rapid due diligence 
assessment of BPR/BPRS to assess their suitability for participation in the financing 
mechanism 
ƒ
Installation of 
a
debtor’s helpdesk or debt counseling facility to facilitate borrowers’ 
access to information on existing options to renegotiate terms and conditions of 
repayment (this facility will preferably be established within the same BI unit which will 
be in charge of QUICK
29
).  The facility will have a temporary coverage of two 
provinces but as the QUICK, it has the potential for nationwide replication. 
 
Stage Two: Capacity Development 
 
ƒ
Loan officers of the participating financial institutions will receive trainings in the 
analysis of their client’s business plans and in the formulation of appropriate work-out 
strategies.  
ƒ
A
pool
of
business mentors will be trained to broker and mediate work-out strategies 
between the MFIs and the selected enterprises.  It is envisaged to enable the BI’s 
existing pool of Real Sector Advisors (KKMBs) to fulfill this function.  This is in line 
with BIs strategy of using KKMBs to promote MSME access to financial institutions.  
ƒ
The lack of liquidity faced by BPR/BPRS will be addressed using the cascading 
financing mechanism that has been developed and used in GTZ–ProFI’s pilot project to 
channel FA for repairs of earthquake affected houses and productive dwellings and to 
provide wholesale loans to traders for on-lending to earthquake-affected low income 
self-employed in the earthquake affected areas. 
ƒ
To ensure smooth functioning of the mechanism, TA will be provided to PNM. 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that lay out clearly defined criteria for the 
disbursal of loans will be developed.  Management Information System (MIS) support 
can be envisaged for the participating BPR/BPRS where required. 
 
29
 
QUICK
,
or 
Quick Impact Capacity Development & Knowledge Transfer Centre for Microfinance in Post 
Disaster Environments
 is a data management facility for domestic and international assistance agencies to help in 
making available past experience and lessons learned from each others´ post disaster activities. This knowledge 
management system will initially be established and managed by GTZ as part of the ProFI Program in the central bank. 
After establishment and consolidation, QUICK will be handed over to Bank Indonesia as one of the central bank´s web 
based knowledge management and information systems. 
 
Page  48
43
Stage Three: Developing mutually agreeable arrangements to restructure loans for viable 
enterprises 
 
ƒ
Together with BPR/BPRS loan officers, the business mentors will carry out feasibility 
assessments of the participating enterprises to assess their rehabilitation potential and to 
develop a possible work-out strategy. 
ƒ
The KKMBs will support the selected enterprises in presenting their business cases to 
the BPR/BPRS loan officers for an assessment of their business strategies.  The BPRs 
will elaborate work-out options, which will be documented and presented to the 
individual businesses.  
ƒ
The provision of fresh financing through the special refinancing line will be an optional 
part of the package following the specified SOPs.  In cases where an effective work-out 
strategy is not possible the banks will need to take appropriate decisions in line with the 
applicable BI regulations. 
 
Stage Four: Documentation
 
and dissemination of lessons learnt
 
ƒ
Documentation and dissemination of lessons learnt to the BPR/BPRS management and 
other stakeholders in workshops and via the QUICK information centre.  
ƒ
Best practices and examples of successful work-out strategies adapted to sector-specific 
issues faced by different industries will be made available to relevant parties via QUICK 
and BI’s online portal for SME development (SI-PUK
30
).  Additionally, this information 
may also be captured in a practical handbook.  
 
14. 
Component/Theme III.  Restoring full capacity and creating opportunities for 
improving competitiveness of medium size enterprises 
(USD1.59 million).  Under this 
component the project will provide credit to the eligible MEs for capital investments towards civil 
works or replacement of machinery.  This will be complemented, as necessary, with technical 
assistance for product improvement and regaining access to markets.  Loan sizes are expected to 
range from about USD20,000-USD50,000.   
 
30
 
Integrated Information System for Small scale Enterprise Development
(SI-PUK):  This data base supports micro 
and small enterprise development through the provision of the relevant information.  Types of information provided 
include loan data, potential commodities to be developed in district and sub district levels, potential export 
commodities, lending model for small enterprises, loan-obtaining procedure, and other information related to loan for 
small enterprises.  SI-PUK is a set of internet-based information systems, which have been designed by Bank Indonesia 
to support banks and financial institutions to provide loans for small enterprises.  It is an integrated and user-friendly 
system, which consists of the following sub systems:  
 
1. Information system of Baseline Economic Survey (SIB) 
2. Information system of export-oriented agro-industry (SIABE) 
3. Information system of Lending Model for small enterprises (SI-LMUK) 
4. Decision support system for investment (SPKUI) 
5. Information system of loan obtaining procedure (SI-PMK) 
 
Page  49
44
GTZ’s Approach: 
ƒ
Assistance focusing on medium sized enterprises with significant potential for business 
growth, and which have been affected by the earthquake.  The assistance will help them:  
i) reconstruct their premises; ii) replace damaged/lost machinery; and iii) regain 
markets.  This financial assistance will be complemented as necessary with technical 
assistance for product improvement, as well as appropriate support in regaining access 
to regional, national and international markets. 
 
ƒ
The second sub-component concentrates on capacity building for micro credit 
institutions to help them design soft loan products for medium size enterprises and to 
properly assess loan and investment opportunities for medium size enterprises.  
 
15. 
Component VI - Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation
 (USD2.60 
million).  Under this component the project will finance all costs associated with management, 
implementation, and supervision of the project incurred by the GTZ.  This amount includes GTZ
’s 
organizational overhead charge of USD.66 million (6.5 percent of the total estimated costs).

GENCIES
 
A. Partner 
Organization 
 
1. 
PT. Permodalan Nasional Madani (Persero) or PNM is a state-owned enterprise with BI and 
Ministry of Finance as shareholders.  It was established in 1999 through Presidential Decree No. 38 
for the specific purpose of development and empowering MSME in Indonesia.  PNM serves as a 
wholesaler and alternative financial institution, so it can be more nimble and flexible in developing 
Indonesia’s MSME.  It comprises the following main business units: 
 
·
Micro-Finance and Syariah Financial Institutions 
·
“Kredit Program” or Programmed Credits, taking over BI’s twelve direct lending schemes 
·
PNM Venture Capital  
·
PNM Investment Management, established to build up products that can channel funds to 
local development projects such as for instance the probable establishment of Aceh Fund  
 
2. 
As a strategy for the development of MSME, PNM pursues the strategy of MFI 
development (MFIs such as i) BPRs, which are “Rural Banks” (Bank Perkreditan Rakyat, BPR) or 
ii) formal or informal cooperatives) based on the following reasons: 
 
·
Local MSME cannot develop in a sustainable way without the existence of local MFI in 
which to channel local savings into local economic development 
·
With local MFI various local customs and traditions can be utilized to safeguard the 
creditworthiness of any credit extension 
·
In many cases in Indonesia, MFI are a local initiative, and as such, it involves a lot of local 
community participation in the attendant business activities 
 
3. 
GTZ already has channelled Euro 500.000 for earthquake recovery in 2006/7 and have 
selected PNM as the most suitable institution to administer funds, to be channelled through MFIs, 
including secondary banks or “Rural Banks” (BPR), to MSME.  In this context, 15 participating 
BPR were selected by GTZ, together with BI, PNM and the regional apex/coordinator BPR based 
on the following criteria: 
 
·
target group orientation by average loan size 
·
effect of the earthquake on the BPR; percentage of the loan portfolio affected 
·
solvency risk as seen from the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) 
·
financial performance: NPL, LDR, ROE, and ROA 
·
B. Implementing 
Agencies/Intermediaries 
“Rural Banks” (BPRs) 
4. 
The Law on Banks distinguishes between “Commercial Banks” (Bank Umum) and 
secondary “Rural Banks” (Bank Perkreditan Rakyat, BPR) with activities limited to Rupiah 
transactions, mainly mobilizing third party funds (savings, time deposits), providing loans, and 
depositing surplus funds with other banks.  
Page  52
47
 
5. 
BPR are regulated and supervised by Bank Indonesia (BI), the Central Bank.  Owners, 
represented by the board of commissioners and its chairperson, and directors (minimum two), have 
to pass a fit and proper test.  Directors have to pass compulsory banking-related examinations 
(Certif).  The chairperson of the board of commissioners and the directors are liable with their 
private property for the losses of the BPR.  
 
6. 
A compulsory deposits insurance covers individual deposits up to Rp100 million 
(USD10,000) provided the interest rate agreed upon does not exceed a cap stipulated from time to 
time by Lembaga Penjamin Simpanan (LPS), the Indonesia Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
 
7. 
Characteristically, BPR operate from a (head) office located in population centers, some 
institutions operate additionally a cash office, and less than 20% established a branch.  They 
employ about 15 - 50 persons.  Their assets amount to Rp5 billion
–Rp50 billion (USD500,000 to 
USD5 million).  They serve around 5,000 depositors and some 2,000 debtors.  Most BPR are 
owned by private parties, about 30% by regencies, and some 5% by members of a cooperative.  
Minimum equity for BPR depends on its domicile.  It is Rp1,000 million (USD100,000) for BPR in 
Java outside provincial capitals. 
 
8. 
BPR are especially vulnerable to local economic shocks, because, unlike large commercial 
banks with many branches, they cannot balance the losses in one place with profits of other non-
affected institutions in other places. 
 
9. 
As mentioned above GTZ already channeled funds of Euro 500.000 through PNM to 15 
BPRs. These BPR extend mostly monthly installment loans with grace periods not exceeding three 
months.  So far, from the EUR 500.000 grant, a total IDR5,552 million were disbursed to MSME 
since December 2006.  Until September 2007, debtors repaid IDR1,053 million (balance IDR4,499 
million).  All loans are rated “sound” based on BI standards.  
 
10. 
The Livelihood Recovery Project intends to continue the cooperation with these banks and 
to increase their funds if requested.  Until now, only nine of 57 BPR in Yogyakarta and six out of 
27 BPR operating in Klaten and its surroundings participate.  GTZ will review the requests of more 
BPR interested in providing loans to their earthquake-affected clients.  Ideally, by refinancing 
earthquake-hit MSME, these BPR would not only improve the livelihood of their clients but also 
improve the quality of their loan portfolio and simultaneously the rating of their bank. 
 
11. 
Backed by the satisfying performance of new loans to earthquake-affected MSME, the 
future selection criteria will emphasize cooperation with BPR with a high number of NPL, which 
were provoked by the earthquake, and the readiness to accept and implement technical assistance 
measures.  
Cooperatives
 
12. 
Both, single-purpose savings and credit cooperatives (SCC) and savings and credit units of 
multi-purpose cooperatives, provide small loans, typically less than IDR5 million (USD500), to 
their members, who are active as micro entrepreneurs.  Thanks to their proximity to their members, 
cooperatives can arrange for loans with small amounts, even below IDR500,000 (USD50).  GTZ in 
Page  53
48
consultation with Dinas Koperasi and PNM will select suitable cooperatives with a proven 
performance record (selection criteria apply
3
1
)
to offer them funds to be forwarded as loans to those 
members, whose businesses are located in the disaster area and suffered from reduced turnover. 
 
Foundations/NGO and SHG
 
13. 
Several large NGO are active in Yogyakarta and in Central Java already many years before 
the earthquake struck the area and derailed the livelihoods of so many people.  GTZ has a record of 
cooperation with them since the pilot project phase of PHBK with BI in the late 1980s.  The NGO 
were responsible for technical support to informal savings and credit groups before increasing the 
group fund through a bank loan or through own or donor funds.  Different models of channeling 
funds were developed, such as: (i) the NGO obtains a loan and forwards this loan to the group; or 
(ii) the group obtains a loan and NGO provide technical assistance only.  Recently, NGO mobilized 
savings and credit groups und their guidance to establish a formal cooperative, such as YP2SU 
initiating the multi-purpose cooperative GEMI. 
 
14. 
Dinas Koperasi officials know the larger NGO, which are involved and experienced in 
financial transactions with their target group.  Dinas Koperasi keeps performance records for those 
NGO, which received funds from government programs to finance and develop self-help groups. 
 
15. 
So far, GTZ cooperates with six NGO and cooperatives
32
 in Bantul and Klaten in the matter 
of earthquake recovery assistance.  So far 2,367 beneficiaries have been reached until August 2007.  
Experienced NGOs can mobilize more than 20 groups with over 100 members per month.  For the 
JRG project it is proposed that the group members, predominantly women, would be eligible for a 
first small loan (USD50-100) after three months practicing savings and credit activities in the 
group.  Repayment rates are kept high because members repaying on time will be awarded an 
attractive follow-up loan with a ceiling of USD100-200. 
 
16. 
It is envisaged, also on request of the local governments, to cooperate with NGO and SHG 
in particular locations, which are at a distance from BPR and other financial institutions, such as 
various less densely populated places in Kulon Progo and Gunung Kidul. 
31
 The State Ministry of Cooperatives and Small Medium Entrepreneurs (SMoCSME) developed criteria and selection 
processes for identifying qualified cooperatives for on-lending funds up to IDR100million (USD10,000).  Those 
cooperatives that successfully participated in these schemes are candidates for the participation in channeling 
“earthquake funds” to MSME in their vicinity.  Details are available with the regency-based Dinas Koperasi offices. 
32
 Koperasi Setara, Klaten; Koperasi Daya Annisa, Bantuk; Koperasi Gemi (under guidance of YP2SU foundation), 
Bantul; Bina Swadaya foundation, Klaten, a branch of a nationwide operating NGO and protagonist of group-based

Handicraft Producers, Bantul, supporting its members in marketing and other efforts, including mobilizing funds for the 
members’ businesses;

C. 
Cooperation
 
Cooperation with Bank Indonesia (BI) 
17. 
Cooperation with BI is crucial with regard to ensuring the engagement of BPR.  BI decides 
on the framework in which the BPR have to move.  Therefore, technical assistance to BPR should 
always be coordinated with BI.  Additionally, BI might even support training measures with its 
own budget and BI might propose BPR to cover part of the training costs from the BPR’s 
compulsory budget for staff training and upgrading (BPR have to set aside 5% of their annually 
salary payment for training measures.) 
 
18. 
GTZ’s relationship with BI dates back to before 1980, then with focus on small medium 
enterprises (Small Enterprise Development Project).  A joint project on lending to groups 
(Pengembangan Hubungan Bank dengan Kelompok, PHBK) started 1988, and, since 1999, was 
followed by the cooperation in the Promotion of Small Financial Institutions (ProFI).  During these 
years, GTZ gained ample experience in the field of micro finance in Indonesia.  GTZ established 
working relationships with national and local NGO in the field of microfinance (through PHBK), 
with non-bank financial institutions (such as Lembaga Perkreditan Desa, now more than 1,300 
village banks in Bali), with BPR and BPR associations (in particular support to Perbarindo Bali and 
East Java).  Furthermore, GTZ gained competence in the implementation of small, truly rural 
financial institutions in West Sumatra through the Regional Development Bank, Bank Nagari 
(Rural and Micro Banking Project, 1981-2000).  Former counterparts from West Sumatra assume 
also positions in Certif, the national institution for qualifying and certifying BPR directors. 
 
19. 
GTZ through its cooperation with BI in Jakarta in the joint project “Promotion of Small 
Financial Institutions (ProFI)” engages in BPR development, among others through support to: 
 
·
BPR association Perbarindo (on regional and national level) 
·
Certif, an institute responsible for qualifying BPR managers and BPR staffs  
·
various BPR apex models and BPR apex model development 
·
BPR development through consultation, e.g. for BI’s BPR Blueprint  
 
20. 
As a response to various difficulties experienced by small financial institutions, including 
BPR, in the aftermath of the 27 May 2006 earthquake, an earthquake recovery component was 
added to the ProFI project.  It is concerned with channeling revolving funds to 15 BPR in DIY and 
Central Java for financing MSM that were affected by the quake.  In particular with regard to 
questions referring to restructuring loans the JRF Project via GTZ should provide a forum or 
platform (or support the BPR association Perbarindo to do so) for communication with BI, in which 
related problems can be identified, discussed and resolved.  GTZ will play the role of a facilitator as 
BPR prefer not approaching BI if not urgently required. 
 
21. 
Under the umbrella of the ProFI cooperation, GTZ and BI also embarked on “QUICK,” an 
effort to collect data on the impact of natural disasters on small financial institutions and their 
vulnerability, which could be observed in Aceh after the tsunami.  These data might assist to better 
support ailing MFI, including weak BPR. 
Page  55

Cooperation with Other Projects 
(a) 
Regional Economic Development (RED), Klaten, Central Java  
22. 
It happened that the earthquake hit Klaten, a location where GTZ joint forces with 
Bappenas, the National Ministry for Planning in the RED project to support economic development 
through three components: 
 
·
support to individual small medium enterprises 
·
advise to local governments on the regulatory framework for enterprises 
·
inter-district cooperation and management  
 
23. 
Support to individual enterprises refers to, among others, the promotion of value chains, the 
quality and availability of business development service providers (BDS-P), access to finance, and 
access to market information.  In 2006, a fourth component, was added, the Earthquake Recovery 
Assistance.  This component supported economic recovery and integration of earthquake safe 
construction into teachings at vocational colleges. 
(b) 
Program Lingkungan Hidup (ProLH), Ministry of Environment, GTZ 
24. 
It is estimated that industrial pollution constitutes from 25% to 50% of the total pollution 
load in different rivers in Java, including an increasing amount of toxic and hazardous substance, 
which is also produced by thousands of MSME. 
 
25. 
The Ministry of Environment with the support of GTZ through the joint project ProLH 
(Indonesian-German environmental Program) developed activities on eco efficiency in small and 
medium-sized enterprises.  In addition, this program initiated the establishment of the Indonesian 
Cleaner Production Center (ICPC) in 2004 in order to stimulate the development of the Cleaner 
Production (CP) and Eco Efficiency (EE) market.  The ICPC is stimulating, facilitating and 
catalyzing Eco Efficiency implementation by supporting service providers in Indonesia.  The ICPC 
is acting as a platform for Eco Efficiency, providing training, awareness-raising events, knowledge 
management, and demonstration projects.  Training measures are offered in the following fields:  
 
·
Good Housekeeping  
·
Chemical Management  
·
Occupational health and Safety  
·
Environmental Management (Accounting and Environmental performance 
Assessment/Indicators)  
·
Cleaner Production (CP) General & Communication  
·
CP Marketing strategy  
·
CP and Banking  
 
26. 
Quite a number of eco efficiency measures decrease costs (energy saving, e.g. more fuel 
efficient kilns for the ceramics industries) or increase profits in other ways.  GTZ will employ the 
services of ICPC to train loan officers to identify and finance these win-win constellations.  At the 
same time, when entrepreneurs replace their earthquake-damaged or -destroyed assets, loan officers

together with MSME should pay attention to that new investments will be more environment-
friendly. 
(c) 
Good Local Governance (GLG), DIY and Central Java 
27. 
GTZ’s GLG initiative supports sub-national governments in their increased control over 
local resources and their responsibilities for the delivery of public services.  “Disaster Risk 
Management” is one of the topics.  This project addresses the needs of people in the earthquake 
areas through rebuilding infrastructure and repairing public facilities, including fixing irrigation 
schemes.  The efforts are a contribution for all villagers, because it is common that families in rural 
areas, although engaged mainly in other activities, will still work on and live from their rice fields.  
(d) 
Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) 
28. 
In late 2006, AusAID started assisting the earthquake-hit population with tarpaulins.  The 
distribution of these shelters stopped early 2007, when the rainy season was over.  AusAID selected 
NGOs to hand out grants, mostly for housing reconstruction, to the tune of Rp2 million per 
beneficiary without attaching particular conditions to it.  They were rather freely handed out to 
people in need in more than 600 villages.  However, besides community assistance and house 
construction, restoring livelihoods is only one of three sectors of AusAID’s support.  The USD2 
million fund was also depleted by the Mobile Community Assistance (MCA) for local governments 
to restore the infrastructure, such as rebuilding schools and primary health centers (Puskesmas).  It 
is expected that a fund of similar size will be available until August 2008 to execute a number of 
projects, which are still in the pipeline, among them also a scheme for restoring the livelihood of 
disabled persons and assistance to home-based cottage industries in the ceramics sector.  
 
29. 
Most of the assistance went to Bantul and Klaten regencies.  AusAID stated explicitly that 
their support focus in these two regencies because of efficiency considerations.  The number of 
victims, property losses, and assistance received were highest so far in these two places.  So is the 
number of people who have not yet received any assistance apart from the government’s housing 
allowance. 
 
30. 
Cooperation and bundling of efforts is envisaged, because grants to individual MSME 
increase the business assets of these beneficiaries and thus their creditworthiness.  For example, a 
working capital loan may well compliment provision of tools, which were handed out as a grant.  In 
a
similar way, improving the infrastructure in particular villages will also benefit the small business 
people in this place and improve their competitiveness, thus qualifying them for a loan.  
(e) 
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) 
31. 
In September 2006 UNDP started the disbursement of “mini grants” amounting to up to 
Rp250 million (USD25,000) to nine NGO.  These NGO responded successfully to an 
announcement in the newspaper (tender) in which UNDP looked for financial intermediaries.  The 
grant was forwarded to community groups of 20-30 members who received about Rp8 million 
(about Rp 300,000 or USD30 each) as a revolving fund carrying a 1-2% interest rate.  Although the 
measures were not always well coordinated, it happened that a UNDP-sponsored NGO supported 
micro entrepreneurs in a village, where these micro entrepreneurs received RED’s skills and 
marketing as well as entrepreneurship training.  It is assumed that UNDP activities will finish in 
Page  57
52
March 2008.  This is when successful self-help groups or individual micro entrepreneurs would 
apply for a much larger follow-up loan, which could be arranged through participating BPR. 
 
32. 
Presently, UNDP is engaged in working out strategies for the local governments on further 
follow-up measures to be included in the 2008 budget.  UNDP provided a set of about 25 maps, 
which indicate the degree to which villages were hit (e.g., number of destroyed houses, latrines, 
health facilities, etc.) and assistance from donors provided.  These maps are a valuable instrument 
for the planning of and decision on further relief measures. 
 
During a recent meeting with government agencies UNDP presented a strategy for activities in 
2008 for regency Klaten (Central Java) and Bantul (DIY), both places that were also the focus of 
other donors

The Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer Technische Zusammenarbeit
–GTZ–is an international 
cooperation enterprise for sustainable development, with worldwide operations.  In the framework 
of the German Development Cooperation, GTZ is currently implementing about 1,920 development 
projects and programs in over 130 countries.  
 
2. 
GTZ’s corporate objective is to improve people’s living conditions on a sustainable basis.  
By promoting complex reforms and change processes, we provide viable, forward-looking 
solutions for political, economic, ecological and social development in a globalized world.  
 
3. 
GTZ’s main client is the German Federal Government.  In addition, international clients 
include the European Commission, development banks, the UN and foreign governments, as well 
as private companies. 
 
4. 
GTZ has been active for many years in Central Java and Yogyakarta through two programs: 
the Regional Economic Development (RED) Programme, and the Promotion of Small Financial 
Institutions (ProFI) Programme.  After the earthquake in 2006 GTZ extended both programs to 
support the earthquake recovery endeavor.  
 
5. 
RED works together with local MSMEs to improve products and increase the range of 
products through training with business development services and experts from training 
institutions.  Moreover MSMEs are supported to find access to new markets. As part of the 
assistance, financial assistance is provided to selected NGOs to offer micro credit schemes to 
MSMEs for the economic recovery of their businesses.  The measures include the entire village 
community and provide advice throughout the project phase.  
 
6. 
ProFI aims at increasing the number and volume of microfinance services accessible to the 
self-employed and lower income segments of the population.  At the same time, financial 
institutions in the earthquake affected areas benefit from capacity development and the transfer of 
technical skills related to areas, such as special loan services for lower income groups and people 
without tangible collateral, low-cost housing finance, working capital and investment loans to 
micro entrepreneurs and insurance.  This type of support is normally slow to come forward after 
natural calamities.  The central bank, the Bank Indonesia and GTZ are implementing microfinance 
promotion measures in the provinces of DI Yogyakarta and Central Java to facilitate economic 
development and sustainable institution building. 
 
7. 
GTZ has been active in Indonesia since the early 1970’s, and over the last two years has 
implemented a wide range of collaborative projects in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, in the areas of 
rural finance and micro-finance, local and regional development, governance, and agricultural 
development.
