for Daerah Istimewa (DI) Yogyakarta and Central Java Project\n            is to contribute to the Government of Indonesia (GoI)\n            initiatives to assist micro, small and medium enterprises\n            (MSMEs) affected by the earthquake to revitalize their\n            businesses and to re-integrate affected low income\n            communities into economic life. There are four components to\n            the project, the first component being access to finance\n            linked to technical assistance for micro and small and\n            enterprises (MSEs). The second component is the defaulting\n            loan 'work-out' strategy for viable enterprises.\n            Under this component the project will assist eligible small\n            and medium enterprises (SMEs) whose loans with Bank\n            Perkreditan Rakyat (BPRs) are in arrears to renegotiate and\n            work-out the loans.  The third component is the restoring\n            full capacity and creating opportunities for improving\n            competitiveness of medium size enterprises. Under this\n            component the project will provide credit to eligible medium\n            size enterprises for capital investments towards civil works\n            or replacement of machinery. Finally, the fourth component\n            is the project management and monitoring and evaluation.\n            Under this component the project will finance all costs\n            associated with management, implementation, and supervision\n            of the project incurred by the German Agency for Technical\n            Assistance (GTZ).  This amount includes GTZ's\n            organization overhead of US$0.66 million (6.5 percent of the\n            total estimated costs)."}, "docdt": "2009-01-22T00:00:00Z"}
