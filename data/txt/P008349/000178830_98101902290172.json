to upgrade the incomes\n            and quality of life in the economically depressed Pitsilia\n            region, and includes the following investments: irrigation\n            and rehabilitation (1150 ha), soil conservation (2500 ha),\n            land consolidation (500 ha), and on-farm water distribution\n            (1000 ha). Other investments include village streets and\n            farm roads, schools, health facilities, domestic water\n            supply, extension facilities and farmer training, veterinary\n            facilities, agricultural research and special\n            project-related studies. Although not major risks,\n            realization of the expected benefits will depend on\n            management's ability to coordinate and control the\n            project, and the results of systematic tests of groundwater\n            availability to determine the levels of safe withdrawals for\n            irrigation before the implementation of water source\n            distribution systems."}, "docdt": "1977-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
