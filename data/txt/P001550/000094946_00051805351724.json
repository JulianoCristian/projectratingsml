and sustainability is likely. Lessons learned\n            sustain that, the strength of the Bank team was paramount\n            for selectivity, and prioritization of project issues,\n            attributed to the experience in financial management\n            activities, such as measures in investment operations, and,\n            furthermore, was highly supportive in the complex area of\n            procurement of information systems. However, the selection\n            of consultants, and technology procurement, was time\n            consuming, thus experience cautions on the inclusion of\n            small information technology components, in the absence of\n            adequate supervision. The continued move in re-shaping\n            project components as needed, proved judicious, ensuring\n            that activities would be accomplished, even under different\n            operations, if necessary. Nonetheless, it is suggested that\n            technical assistance lending may not be the appropriate\n            instrument for the introduction of major policy changes,\n            whereas structural adjustment lending - though not available\n            at the time of project inception - would be the appropriate\n            choice. Once again, close collaboration with partners, and\n            co-financiers is suggested as critical to the success of a project."}, "docdt": "2000-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
