productive sectors by improving\n            the functioning of the financial system.  It aims at\n            strengthening key financial institutions and markets in\n            Madagascar, thereby enhancing public trust in them and\n            enabling them to mobilize savings to meet the investment\n            financing needs of the private sector.  The project consists\n            of:  (a) restructuring the Central Bank, principally through\n            improvements in its research, open market, treasury,\n            internal audit and accounting operations, and through the\n            implementation of information technology and human resource\n            development plans; (b) strengthening the Financial\n            Supervisory Commission with technical assistance to create\n            an effective supervision structure, training for inspectors\n            and equipment for on- and off-site surveillance; (c)\n            improving the accounting and audit environment, through two\n            sets of activities:  (i) training and technical assistance\n            activities to accelerate the development of the accounting\n            profession; and (ii) specific technical assistance and\n            training to bankers, auditors and other professionals; and\n            (d) supporting the privatization of banks in the context of\n            an ongoing process of privatizing one of the two state\n            banks, and a government committment to a similar process for\n            the other state bank by supporting specialized consultant\n            services such as for valuation and placement of these banks\n            with private investors."}, "docdt": "1993-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
