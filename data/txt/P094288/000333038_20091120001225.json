 Development Policy Loan (RIDPL) Project for Lebanon were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, the risk\n            to development outcome was high, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the RIDPL was\n            prepared on the basis of the apparent consensus between the\n            parties regarding future sector reforms to reduce the\n            budgetary burden of the power sector. The Bank was fully\n            aware of the fragility of the consensus on sector reforms in\n            a context of internal political disagreement. However, the\n            continued political crisis made the implementation of the\n            reforms supported by the RIDPL no longer a priority because\n            urgent short term issues demanded the Government's full\n            attention. In addition, the fragile political situation has\n            exacerbated disagreements between parties on the final\n            objective of sector reform and inhibited developing final\n            plans for implementing reform actions. A lesson learned\n            through the implementation of the RIDPL is that the time\n            horizon of the reform program should match the time frame\n            available for Government action. In this case, the window of\n            opportunity turned out to be quite small, and it will have\n            been better to set more modest targets that could have been\n            achieved in a relatively short span of time. A Government\n            dealing with a crisis situation is generally neither willing\n            nor able to focus its energy on implementation of long-term\n            reforms not related to the ongoing crisis. Finally, urgent\n            investments needed for improving the reliability of\n            deteriorating basic services to the public, such as the\n            electricity supply in Lebanon, should not be tied to overly\n            ambitious reform programs. Certain minimum level of reforms\n            are required to support investments that are critical in the\n            energy sector, but these investments should not be subject\n            to conditionality to meet a complex reform program with high\n            political risks but rather to a more flexible reform program\n            that allows room for political consensus to be built."}, "docdt": "2009-10-23T00:00:00Z"}
