Development Policy Loan (RIDPL) is in support of the\n            implementation of the Paris III reform program presented by\n            the Government of Lebanon to the January 25, 2007\n            international donor conference and as reflected in the\n            Interim Strategy Note for Lebanon (Report No. 39779-LB). The\n            Paris III reform program comprises comprehensive measures to\n            improve fiscal sustainability, enhance growth, and deepen\n            the social reforms. The proposed RIDPL supports these\n            objectives with a particular emphasis on the energy sector\n            reform, which is a cornerstone of the Paris III reform\n            program. Benefits are expected to accrue to the Government\n            budget through reduced subsidy requirements to the\n            electricity utility, Electricite du Liban (EdL), thereby\n            freeing up scarce public resources for growth and poverty\n            reduction. Beneficiaries will also include industrial and\n            household consumers who will enjoy more reliable electricity\n            supply and reduced reliance on more expensive back-up generation."}, "docdt": "2007-07-09T00:00:00Z"}
