This report identifies the factors for the\n            project's success as: 1) strong country ownership; 2)\n            the professional and personal commitment of staff at both\n            the Bank and the Albanian Development Fund (ADF); and 3) the\n            commitment of the donor community at large to continue\n            supporting ADF activities in future operations. The\n            highlighted difficulties concern the infrasructure works,\n            local government and community capacity building, social\n            services delivery, governance, donor coordination, and\n            project management. For instance, rursl roads, water supply,\n            and sewerage sub-projects have created noticeable benefits,\n            but in many cases, sub-projects cannot serve the whole\n            community due to over-design or because this would result in\n            exceeding the permitted financial limits. Both issues could\n            be resolved by carrying out a cost-benefit analysis for each\n            sub-project and by formally requesting to exceed the\n            ceiling. Alternatively, the financial limits of the\n            sub-projects could be revised. Another possibility would be\n            to leave financial limits as they are, but sub-projects\n            could be smaller in scope. Although significant progress has\n            been made by the ADF in dealing with local governments,\n            there is still a disconnect between the ADF Charter and\n            reality on the ground. The institutional and Managerial\n            Review suggests revising ADF's Charter. A much stronger\n            poverty targeting, both geographically and by typology of\n            infrastructure, should be sought in the follow-on project.\n            The current criteria \"one commune, one project\"\n            could no longer be justified in light of the GPRS process\n            and a better poverty impact analysis of individual\n            sub-projects should be carried out. Regarding social\n            services delivery, the experience of ADF has been mixed and\n            generally there is room for improvement. The recent\n            \"Institutional and Managerial Review\" suggests\n            that ADF should probably drop the Social Services and\n            concentrate first on excellence in infrastructure projects.\n            ADF could even become an implementing agent or subcontractor\n            agent for the infrastructure component of other projects,\n            including social programs. In regard to governance, ADF\n            should be better protected from political presssures, and\n            there is a need to bring the Board closer to the local\n            level; room needs to be made for representatives of\n            communes/municipalities and the twelve Qarks, as well as for\n            local communities. conflicting procedures have caused\n            confusion among ADF staff, bidders, and beneficiaries;\n            efforts to strengthen donor coordination should ideally\n            include both procurement and contracting issues. With\n            respect to project management, issues that still need to be\n            tackled include updating the terms of reference and job\n            description of ADF staff, particularly the social\n            inspectors; devising a staff training program; and\n            formalizing the yearly staff evaluation process"}, "docdt": "2002-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
