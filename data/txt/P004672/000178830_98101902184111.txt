INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE KINGDOM OF THAILAND FOR A
SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
(KASETSART UNIVERSITY)
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Kingdom of Thailand for the equivalent of US$15.4 million to
help finance the expansion and partial relocation of Kasetsart (agricul-
tural) University. The loan would have a term of 30 years including 10
years of grace, with interest at 7¼% per annum.
PART I - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
2.        Since 1950, Thailand has received 23 loans amounting to $388.7
million net of cancellations. A summary of Bank loans and IFC investments
is at Annex I. The greater part of Bank assistance to Thailand has been
for transportation ($154 million), irrigation ($69 million), power ($91
million) and for a multi-purpose power and irrigation project ($66 mil-
lion). Other loans have been made for vocational education and industry.
3.        In general, Bank-financed projects have been carried out in ac-
cordance with expectations. As of March 31, 1972, the undisbursed balance
of Bank loans was $97.9 million, of which $61.4 million was accounted for
by the last two loans (655-TH and 790-TH) to the Electricity Generating
Authority of Thailand which has placed orders for equipment but is not
required to make substantial payments until it is shipped, and $12.5
million by Loan 702-TH (Third Port Project). Award of the main civil
works contract under Loan 702-TH was delayed until December 1971, and
construction work has only recently begun. As a result of unsatisfactory
bidding for tools and scientific equipment, the closing date of Loan 471-TH
(Vocational Education Project) has been postponed a second time to allow
for rebidding; the first postponement was necessary due to delays in ap-
pointing experts under bilateral assistance. The Closing Date of Loan
455-TH (Second Highway Project) has been postponed to allow the Highway
Department to settle claims and continue paying for the services of engi-
neering advisers pending the Bank's consideration of a proposed fifth high-
way project.
4.        Preparation and appraisal of the Kasetsart University development
project have taken a considerable time. From November 1968, when the Govern-
ment requested Bank assistance for this project, until December 1969, exten-
sive discussions were held with the University to resolve differences bet-
ween the Bank and the University on the rate of development at the University's
new rural campus at Kamphaengsaen. After agreement had been reached, project
preparation was completed in April 1970 and the project appraised in Sept-
ember and October 1970. However, negotiations and presentation of the pro-
posed loan were delayed due to the lack of authority for the Government to
borrow from the Bank. A decree providing this authority was promulgated in
January 1972 and negotiations were completed by March 10, 1972.

PART II - THE ECONOKY AND BANK GROUP STRATEGY
The Economy
5.        During the latter half of 1971, the Bank undertook an extensive
review of Thailand's economic situation and prospects. At the request of
the Thai Government, this review was made just before the start of Thai-
land's Third Five-Year Development Plan (1972-76) on October 1, 1971. Pre-
liminary findings were reported to the Executive Directors last October
during consideration of a loan to the Electricity Generating Authority of
Thailand. The final report entitled "Current Economic Position and Pros-
pects of Thailand" (EAP-28, dated January 11, 1972) was circulated to the
Executive Directors last January. It was also made available to the Con-
sultative Group for Thailand, which met on February 15 and 16, 1972.  Coii
data are in Annex II.
6.        Thailand has a favorable potential for economic growth. Its main
economic assets include abundant natural resources, capable entirepreneurs
and well-motivated workers.  Thai society is open to innovatio6 ' aMd moder-
nization. The political system has remained stable for more than a decade.
The group which took over government in 1958 still runs the dbVntry. After
three years of parliamentary government, it took absolute corifol again in
November, but has shown restraint in the exercise of its powers.  This group
is firmly committed to economic growth through reliance on the dynamic and
flexible private sector.
7.        During the 1960's, Thailand enjoyed rapid economic growth, balance
of payments surpluses and price stability. The main growth stimulants were
rapidly rising investment (from 14 percent of GDP in 1960 to 24 percent in
1969), increasing external demand for Thai products and since 1965 a high
level of US military expenditures in the country. GDP growth ave'raged 8
percent a year. While agriculture grew at 5.4 percent a year',; other sectors
expanded faster than GDP; for instance, value added in manufactuiring increased
11 percent annually.  These high rates of growth in production and investment
would not have been possible without a steep rise in imports, particularly of
equipment, fuels and raw materials; import growth averaged 14 percent a year
in constant prices. Export growth was much slower, especially'in the second
half of the 1960's, and the trade deficit widened considerably.  However, the
balance of payments remained in surplus until 1968 owing to the'growth of
receipts from US military activity, transfers and private capital inflows.
Thus, reserves accumulated to a peak of $938 million at the end 6f 1968.
8.        A period of adjustment to a decline in US military spending and
a reduction in the prices of rice and rubber began in 1969. A levelling-
off in private investment followed in 1970 and 1971. As a result, GDP
growth slowed down to about 6&percent a year, and some increase ini unem-
ployment appeared in urban areas. Imports increased little'in 1970 and
declined by about 2 percent in' 1971 under the influence of 6Iower invest-
ment and production growth,, and higher import taxes.  In spiA-6 6f a 15 per-
cent increase in merchandise exports in 1971, the balance of payments re-
mained in deficit during the past three years. Reserves were down to $777



-3-
million at the end of 1971, equivalent to about 7 months imports.
9.        The economic growth since 1970 has not been enough to prevent
some rise in unemployment or to sustain the considerable rate of growth
experienced during the Sixties in regions outside the central Bangkok area.
The difficult task for the Seventies will be the revival, in spite of adverse
balance of payments developments, of the trend achieved during the Sixties in
economic growth, employment and regional development. Restoration of a dynamic
balance of payments through acceleration of exports is probably the single
most important strategic requirement of Thailand's economic development for
the Seventies. This will require public policies and investment programs to
provide the private sector with the necessary means and incentives for expand-
ing agriculture and industry, especially for export. Special concern for
regional projects and institutions and particular emphasis on primary education
in rural areas will be needed in the interests of better distribution of income.
Projects preparation generally will require substantial improvement if Thailand
is to be able to secure the large inflows of external capital which will be
necessary pending the realization of rapid export expansion. Finally, given
these large foreign capital requirements and Thailand's already large external
debt burden, discussed in para. 13, the economic strategy of the Seventies
will have to include careful management of the external debt.
10.       Government proposals to meet these requirements are in Thailand's
Third Plan. Briefly, the Government's main objective is to achieve GDP growth
of 7 percent a year, while maintaining price stability. Agriculture would
grow by 5 percent a year and manufacturing by 8 percent a year. Further
reserve losses are expected if the growth target is achieved, and the Govern-
ment considers that the balance of payments will become the main constraint
on economic growth in two to three years' time. To help relieve this constraint,
it proposes to carry out priority programs to develop export capacity in agricul-
ture and manufacturing, as well as to encourage domestic production to substi-
tute for specific imports such as cotton, tobacco and dairy products. Invest-
ment growth would be slower than during the previous Plan period (1967-71),
while savings would remain at about 18 percent of GNP., thus keeping Thailand's
resource deficit at around 4.5 percent of GDP. Another important objective of
the Plan is to improve income distribution. This would be achieved through
special provisions for development in backward regions and emphasis on edu-
cation and health, particularly in rural areas.
11.       Although the Government aims at a more moderate expansion of the
economy than in the Sixties, the main quantitative targets it has set will
be difficult to achieve. It will take time to effect the far-reaching im-
provements in development policies and administration at all levels, which
the targets imply. Any delay in critical matters, such as agricultural and
industrial development policies or project preparation, would have an adverse
effect on investment and GDP growth.
12.       The Government can count, however, on a number of favorable factors
during implementation of its development strategy during the Third Plan.



Firstly, there is no lack of resources available in Thailand and the active
private sector can be expected to seize these opportunities when they arise,
as is shown by past experience. There are recognized opportunities for
further export diversification in agriculture, mining and manufacturing,
which will be exploited by the private sector if the Government adopts the
required incentive policies and programs. Secondly, the Government can rely
largely on the high propensity to save of the private sector to achieve the
saving objective of the. Plan. Nevertheless, the declining trend exhibited
by budgetary savings in the past five years will have to be reversed.   Thirdly,
the Government can count on increasing support from official sources of ex-
ternal assistance. The requirements of the Plan are estimated at about $900
million of commitments in official loans and grant aid in the order of $250,
million. The amount of capital aid required is a substantial increase over
previous levels, reflecting thie fact that while in the past Thailand was able
to finance a large share of i-ts investments from its own resources or from
private external sources, the situation has changed and Thailand will have to
obtain a larger share of its capital requirements in the form of official ex-
ternal aid. Statements made by participants at the Consultative Group meeting
last February indicated th1at the figure of $900 million in capital aid was by
no means out of reach, and that capital aid would be available to finance some
local costs and import programs besides the foreign exchange cost of public
sector projects. Finally Thailand can look towards a progressive decline in
the growth rate of its population. The family planning program started in 1968
has already achieved a considerable measure of success and has been made part
of the Third Plan. The Plan objective of reducing annual population growth
from 3.1 percent in 1970 to 2.5 percent in 1976 may take somewhat longer to
achieve; but it nevertheless seems within reach during the latter 1970's,
considering the receptiveness of the population to birth limitation.
13.       On the other hand, the Government will have to make provisions for
elements of uncertainty, which may affect adversely the implementation of the
Plan's strategy and ultimately GDP and investment growth. Perhaps the most
crucial one concerns exports. The Plan target for merchandise exports is a
growth rate of nearly 8 percent a year in 1972-76, but service receipts would
decline because of diminishing expenditures in the country by the US military.
Export earnings from goods and services taken together would grow at only about
4.5 percent a year. Whether this target can be achieved, however, depends to
a large extent on external factors, such as the world demand for Thai agricul-
tural commodities (particularly rice), over which Thailand has little control.
If shortfalls were experienced on this account, it would be difficult for
Thailand to increase other exports over and above planned levels to make up
for the loss. Another important element concerns the Government's economic
administration, which was by and large laisser faire in the past. With the
need to implement new development policies called for by the changing situation,
the Government will need to increase its economic interventions at all levels.
The need to promote crop production for export or import substitution in ag-
riculture, and encourage investment in export-oriented industries and mineral
development are important examples. In order to satisfy this need, the Govern-
ment will have to re-organize and streamline its operations. After last Novem-
ber's constitutional change, ministries have already been re-grouped, but much



-5-
more remains to be done. In particular, the higher level of capital aid
for the Third Plan will require large improvements in project preparation
and implementation, for which Thailand will need considerable technical
assistance.  Finally, private borrowings on short terms rose steeply in
the past, with suppliers' credits being the main factor behind the increase
in debt service payments from 10 percent of exports in 1965 to 18 percent
in 1971. External debt service is expected to become an increasingly heavy
burden on the economy, particularly towards the end of the Seventies, when
it might exceed 25 percent of exports.  The future creditworthiness of Thai-
land will depend not only on its ability to expand exports and to attract
official capital on good terms in the amounts mentioned earlier, but also
on its ability to hold in check the growth of private debt on unsuitable
terms. The Government intends to monitor carefully the use of private ex-
ternal credits, as part of an active external debt management policy designed
to keep debt service payments at a tolerable level. In these circumstances
Thailand remains creditworthy for additional borrowing on conventional terms,
but, as discussed in para. 16 below, this is also a case for some concessionary
assistance.
Bank Group Strategy
1h.          While the overall objectives of the Third Plan are well defined
and appear appropriate to help reverse the recent adverse trends in the eco-
nomy, many of the policy decisions to implement the Plan's objectives have
still to be worked out. Moreover, the Plan is weak in project content. Ag-
ainst an estimated requirement of new commitments of about $1,150 million,
projects proposed for external financing total some $630 million and a major
effort to increase the project content of the Plan will be required in the
next few years. The Government is aware of these difficulties and has request-
ed the Bank's assistance in meeting them. I am considering how the Bank can
most effectively respond to this request.
15.          An examination of Thailand's development program as a whole
indicates a resource gap which will be considerably larger than the foreign
exchange content of projects suitable for external financing. This is likely
despite Thailand's planned efforts to maintain a high saving rate of 18 per-
cent which is as much as can be reasonably expected. I accordingly consider
that some local cost financing will be justified for such priority purposes
as expansion of domestic and export agriculture, education and social improve-
ments including family planning, and regional projects to achieve a wider
distribution of development benefits. These are project areas in which the
larger part of expenditure is usually domestic.
16.          I have also reviewed the case for IDA lending in Thailand.  Given
the Government's awareness of the country's problems, its willingness to
tackle them and its reasonably prudent management of the economy in past



-6-
years, a per capita GNP of about $180 and the longer term debt service out-
look, I have concluded that it would now be appropriate to include some IDA
lending in our program and thereby soften the overall terms of our lending
in Thailand.  While the bulk of our lending in Thailand will continue to
be on Bank terms, I propose to begin some IDA lending in FY 1973, primarily
to finance projects in support of Thailand's efforts to tackle the problems"
of developing the more backward regions.
17.          For the immediate future and possibly for the next few years
until Thailand has been able to develop a wider variety of priority projects,
I expect the bulk of our lending will continue to be directed towards helping
Thailand meet its infrastructure needs. A loan of about $32 million for a,
fifth highway project has been delayed in part due to insufficient engineer-
ing data and will now be present,,ed next year. A project comprising the first
stage of the Telephone Organiza,tion of Thailand's five-year expansion program
is. now being appraised and a mission to appraise the Industrial Finance Corpo-
ration of Thailand (IFCT) for a second loan visited Thailand in April. Mis-
sions to appraise the five-year dieselization and modernization program of
the Royal State Railways and,an irrigation improvement project in: the Northern
Chao Phya Plain are under consideration.  A third education p.rgject is being
finalized for the Bank's consideration. I expect to be able to recommend
these projects for financing during the course of FY 1973. We are examining
and hope to be able to present a crop improvement project and an: urban infra-
structure improvement project in the Northeast region.
18.          IFC has made two equity investments in IFCT totalling $386,286
and a loan of $18 million and an equity investment of $4.1 million in the
Siam Gement Group of companies, of which it now holds $6.0 million.- IFC has
a fruit canning project under consideration and discussions have been held
with sponsors of a petrochemical project. Prospects for further. IFC invest-
ments in Thailand appear reasonably good.
PART III - THE SECTOR AND THE PROJECT
The Sector
19.          The educational system includes a 7-year elementary (4 years lower
and 3 years upper primary) and a 5-year secondary program. Compulsory education,
originally limited to the first 4 years, is being extended gradually through
the seventh grade. Of every 100 children entering first grade in 1970, only
36 could expect to continue primary education beyond grade 4; 25 would reach,
and 10 would complete, secondary education.  The majority of Thai children,
therefore, receive only the fou,r years lower primary education which is too
short a term to achieve lap:ting,literacy. Primary education-,suffers from
a severe shortage of teachers, Qlassrooms and teaching materi,als.  At the
secondary level, an attempt has been made during the past five,,years to cor-
rect the imbalance between academic and vocational secondary education by



-7-
introducing comprehensive schools designed to give secondary education
greater relevance to labor market needs.
20.       In 1970, the eight universities and the National Institute for
Development Administration had a total enrollment of 41,000.  Whereas over-
all enrollment growth has been slow (2.5 percent annually) over the past
five years, the faculties of engineering, science, medicine and agriculture
increased by 13.5 percent per year on average. There were eight other insti-
tutions of higher learning, including the College of Education under the Mini-
stry of Education, military and police academies, and the Asian Institute of
Technology, a regional establishment. Sixteen of the above 18 higher education
institutions are located in Bangkok but the College of Education has several
branches in other parts of the country. The three regional universities account
for less than 15 percent of total university enrollments; and more than one-
half of their students come from the Bangkok area. The Rama Kamhaeng Univer-
sity was established in 1971 as an 'open' university, i.e. without entrance
requirements. It is too early to evaluate this institution though the initial
enrollment of 40,000 (not included in the above figures) is indicative of the
pent-up demand for tertiary education.
21.       Education in Thailand made considerable progress over the past five
years. Enrollment/age-group ratios increased at all levels, particularly in
lower secondary education and teacher training. By 1969 enrollment/age-group
ratios had reached 83 percent in primary schools, 13 percent in secondary
schools and 2 percent in higher education. While annual education expendi-
tures increased at approximatel2y the same rate as total government expendi-
tures, their share of total expenditure in 1970 was low by comparison with
most other developing countries, being only 15.8 percent.
22.       The most serious obstacle to balanced educational development is
the fragmentation of policy, administrative, and financial responsibilities
in education among several government authorities. The Ministry of Interior
has prime responsibility for elementary education but the Ministry of Education
retains responsibility for the technical and pedagogical aspects of elementary
education. It also administers secondary and adult general education as well
as technical institutes and the College of Education at the post-secondary
level. Universities come under the Office of Prime Minister as does the
National Education Council which is responsible for national education plan-
ning. Other major problems in education are the inappropriateness of curricula
to Thailand's manpower requirements, the wide salary difference between govern-
ment and private employment for equally qualified personnel, and the lack of
incentives for qualified teachers to seek employment outside the Bangkok area.
A consequence of this has been wide discrepancies in the quality and availa-
bility of education between rural and urban areas. These problems are being
studied by the Government with a view to finding ways to improve planning and
financing of education and to rationalize the administrative structure. Solu-
tions to these problems, which are likely to entail far-reaching reorganization
within the sector, will take time to be formulated and implemented.



23.       The Third Plan's educational policy has a dual emphasis (i) to
expand enrollments to meet the educational needs of the rapidly increasing
school age population and (ii) to improve the quality of education in order
to produce qualified manpower needed by the developing economy. Public ex-
penditure on education, which amounted to 18.3 billion baht during the Second
Plan period, is expected almost to double to a total of 32.9 billion baht for
the Third Plan period. This should represent approximately 18 percent of total
government expenditure, making education the single largest item after defense.
An increase in enrollment rates is planned in the following areas: lower primary
(3.4 percent per year), upper primary (12.6 percent), university (7.7 percent).
Secondary and vocational education, which expanded at a rapid rate during the
Second Plan period, are expected to grow at somewhat lower rates during the
next five years.  This approach, lhowever, is not fully reflected -in the patt6flh
of allocation of funds within ithe sector and further adjustment-sare -expected
as the Plan progresses. Bank-group emphasis will be directed pr'imarily to the
quality aspects of education such as curriculum development and to priority
areas which would help improve the structural and regional balance within the
education system. In particular, we shall work towards assisting in improve-
ments in primary teacher training, rural secondary schools, ag-ricultural and
other vocational training and selected technical faculties in regional uni-
versities. The Asian Development Bank is considering a project to help im-
prove technical institutes and training centers.
The Project
24.       Thailand's long-range agricultural objectives are increased production
through the intensification of land use, crop diversification and more rural
employment. To achieve these objectives, the Government must build up and
staff a wide variety of rural institutions to support the farmers in their
difficult undertaking of modernizing agriculture. The basic institutions,
necessary for introducing modern agriculture on scientific lines are: extension
services, research centers and experimental stations, vocational schools and
universities. All these institutions exist in Thailand but they come under
separate and various Ministries which tend to work in isolation from one another.
Instead of an integrated effort toward rural development, one finds an individ-
ualistic and fragmented approach, still following traditional concepts. The
flow of information is slow and duplication of effort is frequent. At the same
time gaps exist, especially in fields where multi-disciplinary research or ex-
tension approaches are needed. Thailand's need is rather to coordinate and
improve existing institutions than to create new ones.
25.       Apart from elementary and comprehensive schools which offer certain
agricultural activities and courses, there are 28 secondary vocational agricul-
tural schools and one agricultural teacher training college with a total enroll-
ment of 7,770 in 1970. Three universities (Kasetsart, Khon Kaen and Chiengmai)
have agricultural and related faculties providing tuition in 1970 for 3,200
students. These institutions lack adequately trained staff. They take insuf-
ficient account of the need of the country for modern diversified farming
practices and management. The majority of students come from non-farming
families and do not have a practical background in agriculture. Improvements



-9-
to 10 of these agricultural schools and the agricultural teacher training
college were financed in part in 1966 by Loan 471-TH, the Bank's First
Education Project in Thailand. The project has generally progressed
satisfactorily although equipment procurement has been slow and school
farms have not been developed as rapidly as expected. Consideration of
a loan to help finance the improvement of other agricultural schools will
await the outcome of the study on agricultural education and training to
be financed under the proposed loan.
26.       Kasetsart University is expected to remain for many years Thailand's
leading agricultural university, producing 70 percent of the nation's graduates.
The University evolved from an agricultural college established in 1939 at Bang-
khen, then a rural area outside Bangkok. In the course of time, suburban Bang-
kok has grown and now surrounds the University site. Simultaneously, the Uni-
versity has added several faculties and now comprises faculties of agriculture,
forestry, fisheries, veterinary science, engineering, science and arts, education,
economics and business administration. The University operates five experimental
farms, four forestry stations and two fishery stations located in various parts
of Thailand, all mainly used for research. The University also offers infor-
mation programs for extension peisonnel and farmers.  The academic qualifications
of its teaching staff are relatively low, with only 30 percent holding a Master's
degree and as few as 8 percent having a Doctorate. The majority of its buildings
and facilities are sub-standard and overcrowded. The land available at Bangkhen
campus is inadequate for teaching and research.
27.       The project to be financed by the proposed loan would comprise: (i)
improvements to the University's existing campus at Bangkhen (extensions,
equipment, central library, health center); (ii) the construction and equip-
ping of a new rural campus at Kamphaengsaen, eighty kilometres from Bangkok;
(see map attached) (iii) the development of a comprehensive plan for the physical
development of both campuses; (iv) technical assistance for curriculum develop-
ment and university management; (v) four hundred man-years of university fellow-
ships; and (vi) two studies; one in veterinary education and one in agricultural
education, research and extension.  The project, which would be implemented over
six years, would increase enrollment capacity by 1,520 places.
28.       The new rural campus at Kamphaengsaen, the first phase of which
represents the greater part of the project, will provide a site for the production-
oriented research and teaching programs of the University, where students can ac-
quire practical on-farm experience. Facilities will be provided for the Faculty
of Agriculture and for agriculture related subjects in the Faculties of Veterinary
Science, Engineering, and Economic and Business Administration. The infrastructure
necessary for the new campus includes administrative and student facilities, a
central library, a demonstration farm and experiment station, health and univer-
sity centers, staff housing and a primary school for the new community. Compre-
hensive plans for the development of both campuses will be prepared as part of
the project.
29.       A total of 36 man-years of technical assistance would be provided
to the University for curriculum development, management and the implementa-
tion of the project. The four hundred man-years of fellowships are included
in the project as being the most expeditious means for raising the academic



- 10 -
quality of the University's teaching staff. Approximately one-quarter of
the fellowship years would be made available to the Faculty of Agriculture
with the balance apportioned to the Faculties of Engineering (31 man-years),
Veterinary Science (3), Education (33), Economic and Business Administration
(40), Science and Arts (96), Fisheries (22) and Forestry (37). It is expected
that about 150 members of the staff will benefit from this program.
30.       By providing facilities for 1,520 additional students, Kasetsart
University will help the country meet its projected requirements until 1985.
Only in veterinary science is an oversupply of graduates expected. In this
connection a study has been included in the project to examine whether the
continued support for the two faculties of veterinary science would be jus-
tified or whether one faculty, applying a curriculum fully adapted to the
country's needs, would suffice. (The second faculty is at Chulalongkorn
University in the city of Bangkok). The second study would examine all levels
of agricultural education and training, research and extension services, make
projections of manpower requirements and develop proposals for the reorganiza-
tion of agricultural education and training and the improvement of coordination
between all these activities.
31.       The University has established a Project Unit which would be respon-
sible for the implementation of all parts of the project except the two studies
mentioned in para. 30, which would be carried out by the Ministry of Agri-
culture. The Project Unit would be directed by the Rector of the University,
assisted by a deputy director, secretary, coordinator, architect and administra-
tive adviser.
32.       The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at about
US$28.3 million equivalent, including contingencies of about 17 percent.
The breakdown of costs is given in the Loan and Project Summary at Annex
III. The proposed loan of US$15.4 million equivalent would cover about 54
percent of total project cost. The Government will make available the bal-
ance of funds required for the project. Retroactive financing in an amount
not exceeding $50,000 is recommended to cover expenditures for professional
services (project architect, administrative adviser, campus planners) incurred
subsequent to March 1, 1972.
33.       All contracts other than for consultant and expert services would
be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding. Local firms
are likely to win most of the civil works contracts. It is expected that
nearly all instructional equipment would be procured abroad and nearly all
furniture locally. On this basis it is estimated that Us$o.9 million equiv-
alent of local expenditure would be financed under the proposed loan. A
margin of preference of 15 percent or the applicable customs duties, which-
ever is the lower, would be applied in the comparison of foreign and local
bids for the supply of furniture and equipment.  Disbursements would be made
against 36 percent of the total cost of civil works and professional services
(architects, engineers and campus planners), representing the average estimated
foreign exchange component; the foreign exchange costs of imported furniture
and equipment, the ex-factory costs of contracts for furniture and equipment



awarded to local manufacturers and 65 percent of the costs of imported
furniture and equipment procured locally, representing their estimated
foreign exchange cost; and the foreign exchange costs of the fellowship
program and technical assistance (curriculum development, university mana-
gement, project unit support and studies).
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
3h.       The draft Loaff Agreement between the Kingdom of Thailand and the
Bank, the Project Agreement between Kasetsart University and the Bank, the
report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the
Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft Resolution approving the pro-
posed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The
draft Loan and Project Agreements conform to the normal pattern for loans for
education projects.
35.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
36.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
