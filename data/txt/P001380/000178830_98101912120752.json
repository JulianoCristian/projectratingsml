curriculum development and the expansion\n            of facilities for teaching pre-vocational subjects in\n            secondary schools. In addition, it would increase the\n            nation's pool of skilled workers through strengthening\n            technical education. It provides for construction of a\n            National Curriculum Development Center and extensions to two\n            technical schools and eleven secondary schools, furniture\n            and equipment, essential staff housing, technical\n            assistance, and support for project administration. The\n            project would benefit secondary school graduates through\n            exposure to agricultural and pre-vocational courses; it\n            would also increase the availability and the quality of\n            technical education. Risks of the project are possible\n            delays in recruiting the necessary technical assistance, a\n            lack of appropriately trained local teachers, and inadequate\n            local resources for expendable materials for the teaching of\n            scientific and pre-vocational subjects."}, "docdt": "1977-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
