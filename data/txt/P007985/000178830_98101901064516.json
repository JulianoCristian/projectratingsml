"The proposed project would support: (a)\n            the progressive transfer of urban administration from\n            national to local government, and specifically, more\n            efficient metropolitan management in Lima, the capital of\n            Peru. In addition the project would support: (b)\n            improvements in high priority infrastructure and services in\n            the areas of urban transport, solid waste and whole-sale\n            marketing. Included subprojects would be: (i) traffic\n            management improvements throughout the city, paving of about\n            100 km of streets in low-income areas and road\n            rehabilitation and maintenance; and (ii) construction of a\n            new wholesale market. Other subprojects would include: (iii)\n            provision of vehicles, equipment and transfer station\n            capacity and development of two landfill sites to meet the\n            needs of the city's institution building solid waste\n            agency and the city districts; and (iv) institutional\n            strengthening through studies, technical assistance and\n            training of the agencies charged with each of the above\n            activities as well as improvements in city planning,\n            municipal finance and coordination of urban investments and\n            project administration."}, "docdt": "1984-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
