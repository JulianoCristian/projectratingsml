The lessons learned indicate that the theme of\n            promoting development by providing information proved to be\n            a good way of bringing people together in a region. It is\n            possible to successfully introduce innovative development\n            topics in a region by widely involving every active\n            stakeholder from the very beginning. Information as a key to\n            improve environmental management requires an important\n            adaptation of mindset. A regional approach has the advantage\n            to enable economies of scale in creating and sharing\n            information and knowledge. The financing of the implementing\n            agency should be part of an agreement with donors.\n            Management of projects should put more emphasis on linking\n            financial management and monitoring & evaluation.\n            Technical experts recruited or appointed in project\n            implementing agencies should ensure an adequate transfer of\n            knowledge towards local executives. In future, the project\n            should ensure better links with the private sector, as this\n            sector is a key recipient of the information disseminated\n            and produced by the project."}, "docdt": "2004-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
