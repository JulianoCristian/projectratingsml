"The proposed project would be the first\n            Bank supported effort to strengthen a municipal telephone\n            system in Colombia. It is aimed at expanding and improving\n            service in Medellin, the second largest city, and the\n            surrounding area and at strengthening the Empresas Publicas\n            de Medellin (EPM) so that it can expand services to other\n            urban and rural areas in the largest department in Colombia\n            (Antioquia). The project comprises the installation of (a)\n            about 108,400 local switching equipment lines and about\n            90,000 additional connections; (b) subscribers and cable\n            plant to enable a further 10,000 additional connections to\n            be made; (c) 3,300 public call office telephones which would\n            serve largely low income communities; and (d) buildings to\n            house project equipment. During project execution, EPM would\n            carry out studies aimed at improving the entity's\n            organizational and tariff structure. EPM is a competent\n            public utility and should be able to carry out the project\n            on time; it has already taken initial steps which\n            demonstrate that the risk of unusual delays are minimal."}, "docdt": "1980-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
