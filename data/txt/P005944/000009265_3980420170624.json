Two important factors affected the\n            development of this project: (I) neither the Bank nor the\n            Argentinean Ports Administration (AGP) had any previous\n            experience with one another, and in the project not only the\n            Ports Administration but a major ministry (the Ministry of\n            Works (MOSP)) and two other agencies (the National Grains\n            Board (JNG) and Ferrocarriles Argentinos (FA)) were\n            involved; and (2) general elections were to be held in mid\n            1989. In coming to conclusions about this project, three\n            questions arise: did it fulfill its objectives, could\n            difficulties have been foreseen, and should/could the\n            project have been cancelled earlier?"}, "docdt": "1995-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
