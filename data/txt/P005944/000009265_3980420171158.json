      involvement in the port subsector. It is intended to\n            facilitate grain exports at the Bahia Blanca Port. This is\n            however only for the short term until 1993. A proposed\n            follow up project would address the long term export needs.\n            The project comprises the following three parts. First,\n            civil works and equipment will be used for the\n            rehabilitation of existing infrastructure and the\n            replacement of a damaged grain elevator by a modern\n            installation. Second, civil works and equipment will be used\n            for a silo safety system at selected grain terminals.\n            Finally, technical assistance will be provided to strengthen\n            port management, administration and operational systems."}, "docdt": "1987-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
