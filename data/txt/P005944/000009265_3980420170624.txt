PROJECT COMPLETION NOTE

BAHIA BLANCA PORT PROJECT
(Loan 2805-AR)
1.    The Bahia Blanca Port Project, Loan 2805-AR for US$50 million equivalent, was ap-
proved in May 1987 and was cancelled in June 1992, with US$42.8 million undisbursed. Be-
cause the Loan was largely undisbursed and prematurely cancelled, this Note was prepared in lieu
of a full Implementation Completion Report. The Note is based on a desk review of project files
and related documents.'
Background
2.    By the late 1970s the Government of Argentina (GOA) had been pursuing an economic
policy of export-led growth for many years. Grain was one of the most important exports, and
the port of Bahia Blanca the most important grain exporting port. In 1978 GOA and the Bank
identified a project to expand and improve the capacity of the port, and to improve safety in this
and other public ports. By February 1980 project preparation had reached an advanced stage.
However, uncertainties about investment priorities and the onset of the South Atlantic conflict
delayed project processing. Instead, funding for engineering and other needed studies was
allocated from the Grain Storage Project, Loan 1521-AR.
3.    In 1984, GOA decided to revive the project and proposed to undertake it in two phases.
The first phase would rehabilitate existing facilities, and the second would expand capacity. A
project covering the first phase was appraised in December 1984, and the Yellow Cover (YC)
Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) was issued in March 1985. However, at about the same time a
serious accident put grain Elevator 5 at Bahia Blanca out of action, and while discussions went
on about whether to rebuild and who should do it, the project was postponed.
4.    In May 1987, for unknown reasons on the basis of a revised Yellow Cover SAR rather
than the usual Green Cover, the normal review process was cut short and the project was hurried
and approved. This was the Bank's first port project in Argentina.
Project Objectives
5.    The project was designed to achieve the following objectives: (a) facilitate grain exports
by rehabilitating the grain handling and shipping facilities at the port of Bahia Blanca; and (b) im-
prove the institutional capabilities of the Borrower's port subsector (which included technical
assistance to improve safety at maritime grain terminals, and to develop and implement a modern
cost accounting system for the grain ports).
Project Description
6.    The project had a cost of US$78 million equivalent, and included the following main
components (percentages of total baseline costs in parentheses): (i) emergency works (3%),

maritime works (8%), reconstruction of the grain elevator (58%), silo safety program (19%),
technical assistance (2%), associated railway yard works (3%) and engineering studies (7%).
Proiect Results
7.    Two important factors affected the development of this project: (I) neither the Bank nor
the Argentinean Ports Administration (AGP) had any previous experience with one another, and
in the project not only the Ports Administration but a major ministry (the Ministry of Works
(MOSP)) and two other agencies (the National Grains Board (JNG) and Ferrocarriles Argentinos
(FA)) were involved; and (2) general elections were to be held in mid-1989.
8.    The project was handicapped from the beginning. Although the Loan was approved in
May 1987, it did not become effective until September 1988. AGP and the other two agencies
involved had difficulty understanding Bank effectiveness requirements and the need to finalize
Subsidiary Loan Agreements necessary to, in turn, pass a Presidential Decree that would set the
project in motion. A mission in November 1988 concluded that notwithstanding the delays, some
of which had to do with repeated attempts at adapting procurement documents to Bank standards
and a lack of effort on the part of the Bank to train the Borrower in this area, prospects for
making up lost time were good. In fact, prequalification and other activities had been proceeding
in parallel albeit slowly because of the unfamiliarity of the Borrower with Bank procedures.
9.    In June 1989, as expected (para.7 (2)), the government changed and the priorities of the
new administration were quite different from those its predecessor had. Only a month after the
change, proposals were drafted to concession all grain handling activities to the private sector.
The government made it clear to the Bank that counterpart funding for the project would be
difficult to come by. A supervision mission in December 1989 noted that: (a) the project could
hardly advance further without counterpart funds, and (b) JNG was unlikely to continue to partici-
pate in the project. Still, project implementation continued, and bids for the reconstruction of
Elevator 5 and other major works were opened in December 1989. Concurrently the Bank
requested from the government a Plan of Action to bring the project back on schedule. But in
its response, in March 1990, the government made no commitment, as it was clear that the
Concessions Program was going to significantly affect AGP as well as JNG.
10.   In May 1990, Bank documents raised the possibility of cancelling the Loan. Instead,
MOSP was advised that unless other sources of financing were established by July 31, 1990,
MOSP would have to fund the project out of its own budget. The deadline passed without a
response. By December 1990 the evaluations of the bids for the reconstruction of Elevator 5
were received and concurred with, and there was agreement to use Loan funds to provide techni-
cal assistance to restructure AGP. Both the Bank and MOSP were hopeful that the project could
be rescued in some form. Yet, GOA had to request an amendment to the Loan Agreement as
it was obvious that the project could not be carried out in its original form. No request came
forth.
11.   In May 1991, the question of cancellation was raised again in Bank documents, but no
action was taken. There was no field supervision of the project in 1991, but technical correspon-
dence continued. Finally in January 1992, a letter from MOSP galvanized the Bank into action.
The GOA, faced with Loan repayments larger than disbursements, asked the Bank to reformulate
the project. The reformulation had to take into account that the reconstruction of Elevator 5 had
been passed to private hands, and that the magnitude of the investment proposed was unacceptable
to the concessionaire. The Bank rejected the proposal and a formal request of the GOA to cancel



the loan was received in April 1992. In June 1992, the US$42.8 million remaining in the Loan
account was cancelled, effective April 1992, when the request was received.
Lessons Learned
12.   In coming to conclusions about this project, three questions arise: did it fulfill its objec-
tives, could difficulties have been foreseen, and should/could the project have been cancelled
earlier?
13.   The US$7.2 million disbursed from the loan account were used to pay for: (i) retroactive
expenses on works not directly related to the main purpose of the project; (ii) for engineering
design work for the reconstruction of Elevator 5 which, in the end, the concessionaire found
overdesigned and did not use; and (iii) to fund the authorized deposit to the Special Account
(US$3.0 million). Clearly, no expenditures were made for the project's declared objectives (im-
proving grain handling facilities and the port sector's institutional capacity), and there is no
evidence that the two smaller components of the project (the silo safety program and the railway
yard component) were ever carried out.
14.   In retrospect, it appears that the Bank did not respond quickly, or effectively enough to
the policy changes the administration was introducing. First, though the SAR noted (para 2.11)
that private share of grain export handling at ports had risen from 15% in 1982 to 27% in 1985
and that projections to 1991 envisaged further private penetration to 30%, the strategic implica-
tion that full privatization of grain handling might occur seems to have been missed. Second,
though the SAR raised the issue of the likely negative impact on Bahia Blanca of nearby private
port development at Puerto Rosales, the implications seem to have been ignored. Third, though
the deteriorating finances forecast for AGP should have signalled that the government might be
tempted to privatize the agency, they did not. Finally, elections were due and there were no
guarantees that policies on which success of the project depended would continue.
15.   The new administration inaugurated in June 1989, took little time to signal its intention
to concession a wide range of activities, many in the transport sector. It was clear by November
1990 that JNG, AGP and FA would all be privatized and that the project components associated
with them had lost relevance. Yet the Bank lingered and tried to reform the project in a way
which, inevitably, would have fundamentally altered its character and rationale. Notwithstanding
these facts, there was no suggestion that the project should be reappraised and its merits reas-
sessed. Moreover, the critical deadline noted in para. 10 was allowed to pass without comment
and project implementation continued as if nothing were amiss. Indeed, it appears that the only
event that persuaded the Bank to signal the GOA that the loan should be cancelled was the immi-
nence of repayments in excess of the amount disbursed under the Loan. While the political
consequences of an earlier cancellation can only be guessed at, there is strong evidence that
grounds existed to cancel the Loan at least two years earlier.
