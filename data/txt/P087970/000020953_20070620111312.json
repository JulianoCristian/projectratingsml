  Rehabilitation Project (WDWCIRP), and summarizes the key\n            recommendations of the Environmental and Social Management\n            Plan (ESMP). The objective of the ESIA is to examine the\n            environmental, social, economic, physical, and biological\n            impacts in the areas which may be affected by the project,\n            and propose mitigation measures, monitoring plans, and\n            institutional and budgetary requirements to undertake these\n            as part of the environmental and social management plan\n            ESMP, both during the construction and operational phases of\n            the project. Some of the negative impacts and corresponding\n            mitigation measures are: decrease in available water with\n            extraction from Nile, mitigated by monitoring and\n            fulfillment of monthly water supply; change in hydrology of\n            Rosetta Branch of the Nile, mitigated by ex-ante assessment\n            of and the design and timing of specific mitigation measures\n            to guard against any potential erosion and sedimentation;\n            and change in water quality of the West Delta region,\n            mitigated by sewage treatment."}, "docdt": "2007-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
