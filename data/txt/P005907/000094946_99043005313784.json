The\n            project components include: 1) Water resources will help to\n            increase urgently needed potable water through exploratory\n            and production borehole drilling, rehabilitation of existing\n            wellfields, and the provision of bulk meters. 2) Water\n            supply and distribution will support leak detection,\n            rehabilitation of tertiary networks and house connections\n            characterized by high unaccounted for water, and network\n            improvements. 3) Sewerage will finance emergency sewer\n            network installations, including an urgently needed\n            extension of the sewer trunk main. 4) Technical assistance\n            and institution capacity building will support establishment\n            of an autonomous Sana'a Branch, incremental operating\n            expenditures, construction supervision, technical assistance\n            and studies to support sector reform, and computer\n            equipment. 5) Preparation of possible future Adaptable\n            Program Loans will prepare tender documents for concession,\n            management contract or \"affermage\", engineering\n            design for follow-on projects."}, "docdt": "1999-04-12T00:00:00Z"}
