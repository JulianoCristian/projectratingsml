Although no major\n            environmental issues are envisaged, since there is no land\n            acquisition to force involuntary resettlements; nor is there\n            any indigenous people or cultural heritage issues, there are\n            nonetheless, environmental aspects to consider, such as: 1)\n            cesspit removal and sewage disposal during construction; 2)\n            disposition of dried sewage sludge; and, 3) handling of\n            chemicals flushed into water lines. Mitigation measures call\n            for the prevention of public access to the site during\n            construction. Initially liquid wastes will be transported\n            to, and disposed into the existing wastewater treatment\n            plant pond at off-peak hours, and coliform levels will be\n            monitored. Regarding the dried sewage sludge, even though\n            dried sludge is already being sold for compost purposes, a\n            formal policy will be developed as part of the environmental\n            mitigation component of the project. The disposal of\n            hazardous chemicals will be, partly, the responsibility of\n            the contractor in training workers on handling such\n            chemicals, as well as providing safety gear. In addition, a\n            contingency plan, will specify counter-control measures and\n            spill prevention. Abatement of noise and air pollution,\n            public awareness and consultation processes are also included."}, "docdt": "1999-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
