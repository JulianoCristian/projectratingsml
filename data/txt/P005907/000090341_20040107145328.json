The lessons learned indicate that a limited\n            scope and a short implementation span are ideal to approach\n            transitional situations, such as that encountered in Yemen\n            at the onset of this project, in which the government had\n            been reluctant to focus on policy and reform aspects of the\n            sector as a whole in the past. When acute scarcity is the\n            main sector issue, it is best to avoid fragmentation of\n            instruments and to address issues of long-term\n            sustainability of water resource management together with\n            issues of urban supply of water and sanitation. Thinking\n            strategically throughout project implementation is critical\n            to secure better outcomes. In this case, the earlier\n            implementation of the strategic study included in the water\n            resources component could have provided valuable insights\n            for the preparation of the Urban Water Supply and Sanitation\n            Project (UWSSP) and the Sana'a Basin Water Resources\n            Management Project. When planning a private transaction in a\n            risky country, establishing at the onset an adequate\n            fall-back option might prove critical to the overall success\n            of the approach. Contracting out the establishment of house\n            connections to the private sector is, generally speaking, a\n            good idea and should be encouraged in most situations.\n            Supervision from the field is helpful when institutional\n            capacity is scarce. Having the task management in the field\n            during supervision was helpful in the early identification\n            of implementation issues, such as the design problems with\n            the wastewater treatment plant, and monitoring of the\n            implementation of the environment mitigation plan. It is\n            important to set realistic objectives, especially in areas -\n            such as cost recovery and reduction of losses - which are\n            known for requiring major managerial change before results\n            can improve. In order to better guide design and supervision\n            decisions, outcome indicators should be defined as closely\n            as possible to direct measures of impact on beneficiaries,\n            e.g., consistency of water supply and increase on the\n            overall population served, rather than mileage of network\n            rehabilitated. Outcome indicators and monitoring and\n            evaluation efforts are useless without a solid initial\n            baseline. Levels of UFW constitute a standard and quite\n            acceptable indicator in water operations. In this case,\n            however, the limited scope of the intervention, coupled with\n            the absence of a credible baseline, meant that the indicator\n            would remain marginally significant."}, "docdt": "2003-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
