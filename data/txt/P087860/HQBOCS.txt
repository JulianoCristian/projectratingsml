Amendment to Financing Agreement
Excellency:
We refer to the Financing Agreement, dated July 5, 2006, for the Urban Water Sector Project
("Project") between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan ("Recipient") and the International
Development Association ("Association"), as amended to date ("Financing Agreement").
We also refer to your letter dated February 22, 2014 requesting the Association to create a
single disbursement category, and to eliminate monetary thresholds without changing the percentages
allocated for disbursements against operating costs.
This letter supersedes my letter to you of March 3, 2014.
We are pleased to inform you that the Association concurs with the request, and accordingly
amends the Financing Agreement, as follows:
1.     Part 2, Schedule I is amended to read as follows:
"Part 2: Financial Support to AUWSSC
Strengthening of the newly created AUWSSC, through the provision of financial support,
including payment of: (i) operations and maintenance costs including salaries of non-
managerial staff; and (ii) salaries of managerial staff."
2.   The table in Section IV.A.2 of Schedule 2 is amended to read as set forth in the attachment to
this amendment letter.
All other provisions of the Financing Agreement, except as amended herein, remain unchanged.
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing by signing the form of confirmation set forth
below and returning one fully executed original of this amendment letter to us and retaining one
original for your records. This amendment letter shall become effective as of the date of
countersignature.
