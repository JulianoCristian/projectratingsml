satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            high, Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: the Bank is well placed to support\n            a reform agenda if it is willing to sustain support over the\n            long term. Implementation though government agencies, even\n            if weak, facilitate institutional development by putting\n            clients in the driver's seat and promotes learning by\n            doing. Fragile and conflict states present a unique context\n            that must be well understood and factored into project\n            design. Donor financing in the form of co-financing of Bank\n            operations, or independent financing of standalone projects\n            should take precedence over parallel financing of\n            interdependent project components. The objectives of an\n            International Development Association (IDA) supported\n            project should be achievable independently of donor\n            activities, where the government often has little or no\n            control on the content, sequencing, or quality of activities."}, "docdt": "2014-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
