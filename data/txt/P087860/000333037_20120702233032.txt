                          Restructuring Paper

1.     The closing date for the AFGHANISTAN URBAN WATER SUPPLY
PROJECT, IDA Grant No. H-2250, P087860 will be extended from June 30, 2012 until
June 30, 2014 to allow for the completion of on-going activities.

2.      The Grant for the Urban Water Sector Project was approved by IDA’s Board of
Directors on May 25, 2006 and the Grant Financing Agreement signed on July 5, 2006.
The original closing date was June 30, 2010. The closing date was extended twice, and
the current closing date is June 30, 2012.

3.      The Project provides support for the development of capacity of the Afghanistan
Urban Water Supply and Sewerage Corporation (AUWSSC) for operational management
and investment planning and implementation. Project performance is rated Satisfactory
for Development Objectives (DO) and Moderately Satisfactory for Implementation
Progress (IP). AUWSCC is doing a satisfactory job as a new water utility despite an
extremely difficult environment. Institutional development results have been significant
since its launch two years ago: (i) AUWSSC has assumed the country's urban water
supply and sewerage responsibility and expanded operations from 16 towns to 30 towns.
(ii) Water production and distribution have increased by 18.5%; water revenues by
15.7%; and improvements in billing and collection have resulted in an overall increase of
230% in other revenues; non revenue water has declined by 36.7%, and metered
connections have increased by 54.5%. (iii) The gap between revenues and expenditures
has decreased from 54.46 million AFs to 1.89 million AFs. (iv) The Government’s
recent approval of the increase in tariffs by over 200% will transform AUWSSC into a
financially viable institution.

4.     The Government has requested a three (3) year extension for the closing date of
the Grant as well as a category reallocation on account of financing operations and
maintenance cost, salaries and bonuses of management staff during the proposed
extended period, and also to disburse operations and maintenance cost at a higher
percentage from FY2012, as the operation and maintenance cost is increased due to
expansion of service coverage.

5.     Factors outside the control of the implementing agency have impacted Project
performance, led to slow disbursements, and delayed the submission of an audit report of
the AUWSSC’s accounts as required by the Project legal agreement. Financial
statements prepared by consultants engaged and managed by a bilateral donor partner
were unfortunately found to be unacceptable for audit, and AUWSSC has since then
taken proactive action to re-prepare financial statements after the setback of receiving
unreliable financial statements. Reimbursement of operating and maintenance costs has
been certified by independent auditors as required by the legal agreement. An exception
in accordance with BP10.02 – Financial Management to proceed with an extension of the
Closing Date of the Grant H2250-AF for the Afghanistan Urban Water Sector Project
(P087860) was granted on June 27, 2012.


                                           3
6.      The proposed extension is necessary to allow for: (i) the completion of tasks by
TA Consultants; (ii) compilation of AUWSSC’s financial statements and their audit so
that the Government can comply with the legal covenant regarding AUWSSC’s audits
and claim reimbursement of operating costs from the project as intended; (iii)
continuation of contracts for AUWSSC management that would otherwise end on June
30, 2012; and (iv) preparation of bidding documents for the next phase of investments.
Furthermore, extension of the project, with its critical TA components, is extremely
important for the Bank's engagement in the water sector in Afghanistan.

8.      In view of the fact that (i) the factors causing delays have been outside the control
of the Government and implementing agency; (ii) the Project’s Development Objectives
remain achievable, we recommend the RVP to approve a two year extension of the Grant
closing date from June 30, 2012 to June 30, 2014, as the Grant would be fully disbursed
in two (2) years with the reallocation of Grant proceeds (Annex 1).

9.     This will be the third extension of the project cumulative length of 4 years.
