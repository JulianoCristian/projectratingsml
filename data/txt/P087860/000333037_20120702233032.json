The Government\n            has requested a three (3) year extension for the closing\n            date of the grant as well as a category reallocation on\n            account of financing operations and maintenance cost,\n            salaries and bonuses of management staff during the proposed\n            extended period, and also to disburse operations and\n            maintenance cost at a higher percentage from FY2012, as the\n            operation and maintenance cost is increased due to expansion\n            of service coverage. The extension is necessary to allow\n            for: (i) the completion of tasks by Technical Assistance\n            (TA) consultants; (ii) compilation of AUWSSC's\n            financial statements and their audit so that the Government\n            can comply with the legal covenant regarding AUWSSC's\n            audits and claim reimbursement of operating costs from the\n            project as intended; (iii) continuation of contracts for\n            AUWSSC management that would otherwise end on June 30, 2012;\n            and (iv) preparation of bidding documents for the next phase\n            of investments. Furthermore, extension of the project, with\n            its critical TA components, is extremely important for the\n            Bank's engagement in the water sector in Afghanistan.\n            This will be the third extension of the project cumulative\n            length of four years."}, "docdt": "2012-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
