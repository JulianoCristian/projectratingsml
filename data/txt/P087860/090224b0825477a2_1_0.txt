                         investment planning and implementation, have been substantially achieved. Operational management has improved since the project was restructured; AUWSSC was declared an
                         independent entity on March 21, 2011; the utility has been fully corporatized; after a prolonged initial period when AUWSSC HQ Team consisted of just a couple of managers, a full
