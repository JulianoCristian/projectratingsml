                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project development objectives to develop the capacity of the Afghanistan Urban Water Supply and Sewerage Corporation for (i) operational management and (ii) investment
                         planning and implementation, have been achieved. Operational management has improved since the project was restructured; AUWSSC was declared an independent entity on
                         March 21, 2011; the utility has been fully corporatized; a full management team for AUWSSC Head Quarters is in place, as is leadership in all the six Strategic Business Units
                         (SBUs). With the the Government approved increase in the water tariffs of over 200% that took effect from 5/2/1391 (April 24, 2012), AUWSSC is on a more sustainable financial
                         trajectory. Revenues per connection have increased by 55% by the end of the second quarter of 2013, when compared to the end of 2011.
