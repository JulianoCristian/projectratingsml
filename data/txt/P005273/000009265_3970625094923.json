"The Second Urban Development Project is\n            part of the Government's long-term program to provide\n            shelter for poorer urban dwellers. It aims at improving the\n            living conditions of low-income people in the Amman region\n            by providing shelter at affordable prices without subsidy to\n            ensure the project's replicability; encouraging sound\n            growth patterns through stimulating urban development in\n            appropriate locations and at lower infrastructure cost than\n            under traditional practice; and strengthening institutional\n            capacities in Jordan to undertake low-income shelter and\n            urbanization projects. The project includes the following\n            major components: (a) upgrading two low-income squatter\n            settlements that house about 4,200 people; (b) servicing\n            land in four sites for about 3,400 plots with initial\n            occupancy by about 24,00 people; and (c) providing technical\n            assistance to the UDD for project design, project planning\n            and supervision, studies and advice on management and\n            financial issues."}, "docdt": "1985-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
