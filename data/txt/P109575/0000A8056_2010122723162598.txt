                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The proposed PDO is to restore levels of service in selected community infrastructure specifically: basic, primary and all-age schools, health clinics and critical
                         feeder roads- at a minimum to pre-hurricane levels and to increase the Government's ability to respond to natural hazards.
