Jamaica hurricane\n            Dean Emergency Recovery Loan is to restore levels of service\n            in selected community infrastructure. Specifically, basic,\n            primary and all-age schools, health clinics and critical\n            feeder roads, at a minimum to pre-hurricane levels, and to\n            increase the Government's ability to respond to natural\n            hazards. The proposed loan incorporates three project\n            components: 1) repair and reconstruction of basic\n            infrastructure; 2) capacity building for hazard risk\n            reduction; and 3) project management. Component one has four\n            subcomponents: basic school finance restoration of early\n            childhood schools infrastructure; restoration of primary and\n            all-age schools infrastructure; finance restoration of\n            Community Clinics including type I, II and III facilities;\n            and finance restoration of feeder roads. Component two has\n            two subcomponents which include finance training on disaster\n            preparedness and mitigation for local government and\n            relevant stakeholders and finance studies and activities to\n            strengthen the capacity to better respond to natural hazards\n            taking into account lessons learned from past events."}, "docdt": "2007-12-04T00:00:00Z"}
