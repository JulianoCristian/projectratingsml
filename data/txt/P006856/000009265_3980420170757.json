Roads\n            Sector Project in Colombia are as follows: overall outcome\n            of the project was rated marginally satisfactory. Some of\n            the lessons learned from the project are: 1) the experience\n            gained so far in implementing the Colombian institutional\n            reforms confirms that reform processes do not immediately\n            produce all the intended results. However, they open the\n            dialogue to continue the reform and allow permeation of\n            \"cultural\" change, assuming that commitment to the\n            reform is steadfastly sustained. It is not enough to pass\n            legislation it is also necessary to internalize strategies\n            and concepts and this entails time; 2) the transfer of roads\n            from the central government to the departments turned into\n            protracted negotiations over the control of the resources\n            associated with it, instead of focusing on building capacity\n            through some time-bound programs. The financial mechanisms\n            to support the transfer should be clearly defined in advance\n            to avoid this risk. The experience is demonstrating the need\n            to develop financing mechanisms based on user-charges\n            following the tariff concept established by the Transport L\n            aw--to avoid the current situation in which departments\n            heavily depend on inter-governmental transfers to finance\n            their programs; and 3) designing effective institutional\n            programs aimed at building local capacity poses probably one\n            of the greatest challenges for development projects. The\n            quality and sustainability of these programs become even\n            more critical when dealing with rural communities which are\n            institutionally weaker and more difficult to reach. The\n            effectiveness and the prospects for sustainability of these\n            programs can be increased by: (a) promoting the\n            dissemination of good practices adopted by municipios and\n            the use of strategic partnerships. The former carries strong\n            motivation thus becoming an effective way of speeding up the\n            development of local capacity."}, "docdt": "1996-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
