Sector\n            Project's main objective is to expand markets and\n            reduce poverty in rural areas. It is part of Fondo Nacional\n            de Caminos Vecinales (FNCV) 1990-1993 Investment and\n            Maintenance Program. The main components are: (a)\n            maintenance, including resurfacing works on roads; (b)\n            improvement of civil works along existing dry-weather roads,\n            including completion of bridges and drainage structures; (c)\n            construction of civil works for rural roads; (d) studies,\n            including the review of road-funding strategies and\n            engineering designs, and supervision of civil works; (e)\n            spare parts to rehabilitate and operate maintenance\n            equipment; and (f) training, technical assistance and other\n            services. The project will directly benefit the rural\n            population and production by improving access to social and\n            market services and lowering farmers' and\n            consumer's transport costs. Equally important, it will\n            facilitate the decentralization process in the roads sector."}, "docdt": "1989-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
