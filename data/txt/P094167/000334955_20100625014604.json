follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible, Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Lessons learned include:\n            linking service providers' contracts to actual\n            performance rates, as was the case under PSSP II where\n            training providers had to agree to pre-negotiated job\n            placement rates of participants, is an excellent example of\n            results-oriented project design, which should be\n            increasingly replicated. Establishing an institutional\n            platform for discussion with affected beneficiaries should\n            be considered particularly for those operations targeting\n            vulnerable groups. The Privatization Administration (PA)\n            established such a platform under PSSP II and in its own\n            view it had an important impact, by bringing workers into\n            the privatization process early on. For the PA, this was an\n            unprecedented approach. Project design needs to fully take\n            into account lessons from previous projects, particularly in\n            the case of repeater or follow-up projects. In the case of\n            PSSP II, several lessons from the previous operation were\n            incorporated. Others, such as the importance of making it\n            explicit and including in project design the option of\n            broadening the scope of the labor redeployment services\n            program to the overall unemployed population, was not\n            properly reflected at the design stage. Data collection and\n            tracking of beneficiaries over time is a crucial component\n            of good and sustainable project management. Without this\n            information, programs' effectiveness cannot be\n            determined, and monitoring efforts fall short of assessing\n            the impact of financed activities on the ultimate\n            beneficiaries. The amount and quality of data available to\n            assess the impact of PSSP II-supported activities was\n            limited, particularly with regards to workers' contact\n            information and adequate databases and tracking systems for\n            small business incubators' graduated firms and small\n            business assistance services' participants."}, "docdt": "2010-05-12T00:00:00Z"}
