A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

1. Country and sector issues

        Turkey is confronted by major issues in enhancing its competitiveness to benefit from
globalization and prepare for the progressive economic integration with the European Union
(EU). The state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have been a major drain on the budget, and drag on
the Turkish economy for years. To address these persistent financial imbalances, the SOE sector
i s being privatized, but this runs against public perceptions in Turkey on privatization, which i s
frequently negative. Addressing public perception and the real social costs o f workers made
redundant as a result o f privatization are important elements in ensuring an effective and
sustainable privatization program for Turkey. The Government and the Bank are in broad
agreement on the diagnosis and strategies for economic adjustment and structural reform
including the privatization or liquidation ofmost o fthe remaining SOEs.

        In addition to enhancing competitiveness, privatization of SOEs will make a sizeable
contribution to both fiscal management and the reconfiguration o f the public sector. On fiscal
management, loss-making enterprises will be closed or sold (the largest loss-making enterprise is
Turkish Railways, currently losing some US$700 million a year, but as this can not be easily
privatized it will be restructured under a separate proposedRailways RestructuringProject). The
sale proceeds o f privatized enterprises will be used in the management o f Turkey's net public
debt which currently amounts to 63.5% o f GNP. On the reconfiguration of the public sector,
removing the state's role in the management o f large and strategic enterprises such as Turkish
Airlines and Turk Telecom will enable the state to focus more on its core roles o f economic
management, service delivery and appropriate market regulation.

        Economic Status: Due to its erratic growth pattem inthe past, Turkey could not achieve
sustainable levels o f employment growth, and income inequality has remained consistently high.
Average annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth was 4 to 5 percent until the mid 1990's,
followed by a sharp decline o f about 6 percent in 1999. The economy recovered slightly in
2000, before plunginginto a deep crisis in 2001. The economy recovered strongly in 2002 and
GNP growth reached 8 percent in2002,6 percent in2003, and 9.9 percent in2004 with the GDP
per capita reaching US$ 4,197.      At the same time, inflation has been brought under control
reaching single digits (9.3 percent) in2004, the lowest inTurkey for thirty years.

        This impressive macroeconomic performance has been achieved through a combination
o f stabilization measures, with strong fiscal discipline at its core, allowing the maintenance of
large primary surpluses o f the public sector on the order o f 6.5 percent o f GNP an ongoing
structural reform agenda that was initiated by the previous Government, and followed by the
current one, and political stability since the November 2002 elections. As a result Turkey's
economy has become significantly more resilient to external shocks over the past two years.
Nonetheless, risks do exist, such as if there were to be a sharp change in the global economic
scene, a rise ininterest rates which might affect the Government's ability to roll over public debt,
or possible reform fatigue inTurkey.

        The December 2004 EU decision on the opening o f accession negotiations in October
2005 has been an important signal for the financial markets and has created a firm anchor for
Turkey's development in the years ahead. The process o f accession provides a strong incentive
to continue with political, macroeconomic and structural reforms. Turkey's own pre-accession
program sets out ambitious objectives including 5 percent growth and the reaching o f the
Maastricht gross debt criteria o f 60 percent o f GNP in 3 years, with privatization revenues
helping in this regard. The potential for significant foreign direct investment (including for
privatized SOEs) could also be unlocked by the prospect o f EUmembership, although this will
take time to buildup.

        This impressive macroeconomic performance has not been matched by formal sector
employment creation. Thus whilst the economic situation, enhanced by a positive signal for EU
accession negotiations provides a more favorable environment to privatize SOEs, the economy
has not responded yet with significant employment creation, thus workers made redundant as a
result of privatization need to be assisted to re-join the labor market.

        Income Inequality and Poverty: Turkey has high income inequality, close to the levels
for Russia or Peru. The poorest 20 percent command less than 5.3 percent o f total income,
whereas the wealthiest 20 percent have 50.1 percent o f total income. Differences in education
account for as much as 22 percent o f total income inequality between households, revealing the
existence o f entrenched inequities in access to education in Turkey. The average income o f
adults with higher education i s almost six times that o f illiterate adults. Workers in SOEs are
decidedly not amongst the poorest, but if not compensated for job loss or assisted in gaining
alternative employment, they certainly wouldjoin the ranks o f the poor.

        Privatization Program and Labor Redundancies: The Privatization Administration
(PA), is incharge o fthe Government's privatization portfolio, after a slow start, has made strong
progress in privatization and i s committed to a robust future program.        The Government's
program emphasizes the critical role o f structural reforms in increasing the competitiveness o f
the economy and thus furthering the objectives o f eventual EU accession. There is likely to be
increased international and domestic private sector interest inthe SOEs to be privatized giventhe
improved macroeconomic findamentals, possible EUaccession and that now it is largely profit-
makingstrategic enterprises which will beprivatized.

        The privatization program and labor redundancies supported by the ongoing Privatization
Social Support Project (PSSP) are shown in Table 1, whilst the future program to be supported
by Second Privatization Social Support Project (PSSP2) is shown inTable 2.

        The 21 SOEs which are expected to be privatized and thus financed under PSSP2 have
the following characteristics:

        A total o f about 29,000 employees are expected to be affected, representing about 27,200
        workers (Le., unionized employees), and some 1,800 civil servants, based on an
        assumption that almost all the enterprises will be sold. It i s possible that some will not be
        sold, and that they will have to be liquidated, which would raise the number o f employees
        whose redundancymaybe financedby the loan.

        Classifiedby industrialsector, the number o f employees affected i s as follows: Petroleum
        and petrochemical (5%), agri-business (40%), services including electricity distribution
        and the telephone company (3 l%),manufacturing and extractive (4%), and light
                                               heavy
        manufacturing(11%).

        Forty one percent o f the employees anticipated to be affected work for SOEs which will
        shed less than 25% o f their pre-privatization labor force. Most (44%) are employed by
        enterprises which are expected to declare between 26% and 50% o f their employees
        redundant.      The remainder, (15%) are currently working in enterprises where the
        redundancy rate is expected to be between51`YOand 100%.

2. Rationale for Bank involvement

        The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) recognizes the fact that sustaining Turkey's
economic recovery will hinge upon vigorous reform implementation as a pre-requisite for
eventual EU Accession. Structural reform priorities include restructuring and/or privatizing of
SOEs. Keypriorities for the medium term include inter-alia: (i)      continuingthe restructuring and
privatization of SOEs to enhance competitiveness and (ii)       implementing the reform process
inherent in the EU "Acquis Communuataire" including making the labor market more modern
and effective. The Bank has a deep dialogue and practical experience in helping the PA and
Turkey inthis area andhas the chance to respond to a strong request to continue to do so.

        The October 2, 2003 CAS for FY04-06 identified the themes for the IBRD program:
sound macroeconomics and governance, equitable human and social development, attractive
business climate and knowledge, and strong environmental management and disaster mitigation.
The PSSP2 contributes significantly to the first three objectives.

        There are economic, social, and political objectives for providing social support packages
to workers displaced by restructuring and privatization o f SOEs. From an economic standpoint,


                                                  3

the objectives are to reduce excess labor costs so enterprises can increase productivity and be
competitive, and to facilitate the rapid retum o f workers to productive employment, thereby
reducing the duration o f state-financed income support payments. From a social standpoint,the
objectives are to provide transitional income support while displaced workers are finding
alternate employment and, for those who have difficulty finding employment, providing
extended income support to prevent these workers and their families from slipping into poverty.
From a political standpoint, social support programs are intended to build public support for
restructuring by signaling to citizens, communities, and labor representatives that those
responsible for restructuring are attuned to the needs o f affected workers and that they are ready
and willing to assist those who need and want help.

        Social support programs combine elements that encourage excess labor to leave over-
staffed enterprises, while at the same time helping them to rejoin the labor market quickly.
These measures should include both temporary income support and labor redeployment
programs. To be effective, the measures must be carefully designed and targeted. Furthermore,
there must be continuing monitoring o f the social impact on displaced workers and their families
to ensure that the most vulnerable do not slip into poverty, the labor redeployment services are
reachingthe poorest workers, and additional assistance i s provided, as needed.

        Financing o f Job Loss Compensation (JLC) needs to be carefully justified in the light o f
the criteria for Bankfinancing o fseverance pay (JLC under the PSSP2) discussed below.

    0   Macro-economic and sector policy framework: Recent strong growth, coupled with a
        positive macroeconomic framework going forward as anchored in the IMF standby-
        facility for 2005-2007, for which the letter o f intent has been signed by the Government
        and IMF approval is anticipated in May 2005.               The favorable macroeconomic
        developments will be further buttressed by proposed development policy lending support
        from the Bank. Thus the macro-economic conditions are likely to remain favorable and
        present a positive environment for privatization andthe payment o f JLC to workers made
        redundant through the Government's Privatization Program supported under the PSSP2.


    0   Economic analysis: The experience o f the ongoing PSSP has been highly favorable in
        that productivity has increased in the privatized SOEs or sectors where the SOEs are
        operating. The major loss-making SOEs, with the exception o f Turkish Railways, have
        beenliquidated or restructuredpendingprivatization. The SOE sector currently makes a
        positive net revenue contribution, thanks largely due to Turk Telecom and Turkish
        Airlines. The key objective o f the Government's privatization agenda now is to enhance
        productivity in the remaining SOEs through selling them to the private sector and using
        the sales proceeds for debt management.              The reduced scope o f government
        responsibility will enable it to focus more intensively on its core functions o f stable
        macro-economic policy, good governance, appropriate market regulation and effective
        social services provision.


    0   Sustainability of reforms: The Government has established a solid track record on
        privatization and i s committed to completing the program over the next four years. There




                                                 4

       have been no issues raised regarding the reversal o f previous privatizations.           The
       privatization process thus i s both sustainable and effectively irreversible.


    0  Adverse Selection. One o f the benefits o f only reimbursingthe PA for JLC after the
       enterprise has been privatized or liquidated with a six month follow-up to determine that
       no workers have been re-engaged in the public sector is that it virtually eliminates
       adverse selection. Experience has shown that the most skilled workers are either retained
       inor re-hiredinto the privatized enterprises, thus becoming ineligible for JLC. In-depth
       enterprise assessments o f SOEs which have been privatized under the ongoing PSSP
       demonstrate no evidence whatsoever o fproblems o f adverse selection.


    0  Over-payment: The robust verification system employed under the ongoing PSSP
       ensures that there is no over-payment o f JLC.        Indeed this i s one o f the significant
       elements o f value-added o f Bank involvement in this process. The same robust system
       will be continued under the PSSP2 and the Bank closely verifies the eligibility o f all
       workers receivingJLC financed under the loan.


    0  MoralHazard: Most o f the SOEs beingprivatized have hadhiringfreezes ineffect for a
       significant period o f time, thus no workers are being attracted in by the prospect o f
       receiving JLC. For most workers, JLC represents financial support for a limitedperiod o f
       time to help them adjust to new labor market opportunities and thus does not act as a
       strong incentive to leave the labor market. Although workers in their 50s often opt for
       retirement, or early retirement, follow-up qualitative studies show that many re-enter the
       labor market (formally or informally) or set up small businesses.


    0  Legal aspects and political economy considerations: There is a solid legal foundation
       for privatization as discussed in Annex 1. The JLC and Labor Redeployment Services
       (LRS), as financed under the PSSP, have averted any political economy problems arising
       from redundancies under the privatization program. Labor unions are represented on the
       Tripartite Advisory Committee (TAC), and have come to see privatization as at least
       securing the long-term future o f some workers inmore productive enterprises.


    0  Social Impact: The raison d 'etre o f the PSSP2 is to offset the negative social impact o f
       redundancies arising from the privatization process both through JLC and LRS. The
       social monitoring o f redundancies under the PSSP has shown that a combination o f pre-
       lay-off counseling, the availability and careful targeting of LRS, and JLC have
       significantly reduced the negative social impact o f privatization. The evaluation studies
       show that workers concerns are highest in the pre-lay-off period where there i s major
       uncertainty. Workers, even those laid-off, are much happier after the privatization as
       either (i) obtain employment ina more secure enterprise -no longer subject to major
                they
       uncertainty or (ii) theyreceive JLC andaccessto LRS.

3. Higher level objectivesto which the projectcontributes

       EU Accession and Competitiveness: The primary focus o f the proposed PSSP2 is to
increase productivity o f former SOEs by facilitating shedding o f excess labor, and to cushion the



                                                  5

social impact o f labor displacement during privatization and economic reform. Enhancing the
competitiveness o f the Turkish economy i s a pre-requisite for possible eventual EU accession.
There is a need to ensure that there i s a social support program that is directly linked to, and will
support the implementation o f the privatizationprogram. Turkey's social support systemwill be
stressed by the layoffs o f personnel expected in SOEs under the portfolio at the PA, and to a
lesser degree inthe electricity and telecommunications sectors.

        The proposed project would buttress the privatization strategy through mitigating the
social costs of privatization, thereby also enhancing the social acceptability o f privatization. The
current government i s stable politically, and committed to privatization o f SOEs to enhance
economic competitiveness, reduce the fiscal burden o f SOEs, and concentrate the state on its
core public administration role. Current strong economic growth facilitates this process through
the creation o f alternative employment and providing a more attractive environment for the sale
o f SOEs. The December 17, 2004 decision to open negotiations with Turkey on EU Accession
in October 2005 should further enhance the attractiveness of to foreign investors of strategic
SOEs being privatized.

        Privatization Program: The proposed PSSP2 supports the implementation o f the
Government's privatization agenda. The Govemment is restoring the momentum o f Turkey's
privatization program. Accelerating privatization is a key supply-side element in the effort to
maintain strong growth.      A new privatization program, which includes major companies of
national importance, has been approved, and the Government indicates that this will be
implemented with great vigor over the period 2006-2009.            The Government has a robust
privatization program, to be supported under the PSSP2. The Privatization Administration (PA)
i s making progress inimplementing its program.

        Reducingthe Social Costs of EconomicReform: The continuing privatizationprogram
i s expected to have long term positive impacts on people's lives. However, some groups in the
society will face temporary difficulties as a result o f the economic reforms and the privatization
o f SOEs.

B. PROJECTDESCRIPTION

1. Lendinginstrument

        A Sector Investment Loan has been selected as the most appropriate means o fcontinuing
the support of the Bank to both the financing o f the JLC and ensuring continued high technical
quality and cost-effectiveness in the LRS. PSSP2 is thus a repeater project o f the successful
PSSP.    The loan proceeds will be on-lent by the Treasury to the PA under arrangements
acceptable to the Bank.

2. Projectdevelopmentobjectiveand key indicators

        The development objective o f the proposed PSSP2 is to support the Government's
privatization program through mitigating the negative social and economic impact o f the
privatization o f SOEs. The objective o f the privatization program i s to enhance the efficiency



                                                   6

and competitiveness o f the Turkish economy and thereby help inmeeting the market demands of
EUaccession.

       The PSSP2 will achieve this through three closely related components, namely: (i)    JLC to
assist workers made redundant as a result o f the privatization process; (ii)LRS to help affected
workers find alternative employment; and (iii)   Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (MME)
to ensure effective implementation and assess the social impact o fprivatization.

       Key performance indicators are:

       (a)     Job Loss Compensation(JLC): The productivity o f elements o f the industrial
       sector, comprising about 21 former SOEs, improves as a result o f labor shedding,
       workers displaced from SOEs. Workers receive severance payments, and poverty i s
       mitigated as indicatedthrough results o f social impact assessments.

       (b)     Labor RedeploymentServices (LRS): LRS are delivered to bothworkers made
       redundant directly from within the SOEs and to workers suffering unemployment from
       the secondary employment effects.        Job placement rates are equal to or better than
       similar programs inTurkey and the region.

       (c)     Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (MME): The Government:
       evaluates the impact o f the privatization program and labor redeployment services,
       identifies policy alternatives. Evaluation studies are undertaken and project objectives
       are achieved, disbursements are on schedule, and annual project audits are satisfactory.

3. Projectcomponents

       The PSSP2 has three components reflecting the key components o f the present PSSP
which is due to close on December 31,2005. The primary implementing agency i s the PA for all
components, althoughpartner agencies are also identified below.

       (a)     Job Loss Compensation:       The objective o f this component is to ameliorate the
       temporary negative social and economic impact on workers displaced during
       privatization o f SOEs. This component will finance severance and related payments, as
       regulated by law, to workers displaced byjob loss due to the privatization o f SOEs. It i s
       expected that a total o f 29,000 workers will receive these benefits at a total cost o f Euro
       420 million. The triggers for disbursement are as follows: (i)     full privatization, at the
       conclusion o f the sale agreement; (ii) privatization through stock sales, with at
                                                 partial
       least 51% o f the enterprise in the private sector, formal ordinance to that effect from the
       Privatization High Council; and (iii)  liquidation, formal ordinance to that effect from the
       Privatization High Council. Very limited local technical assistance (TA) will be used to
       assist in the implementation o f JLC. Highly successful rigorous tracking and payment
       verification systems are in place within the PA, and will be continued under the PSSP2.
       These are explained inmore detail inAnnexes 4 and 8.




                                                 7

        The ongoing PSSP, which was approved by the Bank's Board on December 21,
2000, included financing o f severance payments (JLC).        These JLC consist o f three
elements, namely Severance Payments, Special Job Loss Compensation, and Retirement
Social Assistance. Inthe case o f the first PSSP these JLC amounted to US$203 million
within the total loan amount o fUS$250 million. The PSSP2 will continue financing JLC
under exactly the same parameters as the ongoing PSSP. A key feature o f the proposed
operation i s that disbursement of the Bank Loan for JLC would be made only at the
point of sale or liquidation of the enterprise. Since January 2003, some 19,500 workers
have been laid off in 21 SOEs yet to be privatized, with the PA financing the severance
payments from its own resources. The privatization o f these enterprises i s expected to
take place during the life o f this operation and reimbursement o f expenditures for
severance payments will be made as privatization proceeds. This means that
disbursements for JLC classified as "retroactive"         will in fact become eligible
expenditures and reimbursed from the Loan proceeds during the entire implementation
period of the Project from July 1, 2005 to June 30, 2009, unlike in other instances o f
retroactive financing when the funds become available for disbursement at loan
effectiveness. However, the majority o f such "retroactive" payments should take place
during the first 18 months o f implementation o f the PSSP2. Thus a significant portion,
62 percent or Euro 210 million, o f the JLC (severance payments) will be paid
retroactively going back to January 1,2003, at the point o fprivatization or liquidation.

(b)     Labor Redeployment Services:       The objective of this component i s to provide
labor redeployment services to workers who have been displaced by the privatization o f
SOEs, including secondary layoffs, to assist them inrapidlyre-enteringthe labor market.
The component will finance a variety o f LRS, includingjob counseling and placement
services, retraining, and temporary community employment (managed by the Turkish
Employment Organization - ISKUR), and small business assistance services, and small
business incubators (managed by the Small and Medium Industry Development Agency
(KOSGEB). LRS will be delivered to about 11,000 workers displaced in21 SOEs being
privatized and those being affected by secondary unemployment through sub-contractors
to ISKUR and KOSGEB. Small amounts of TA (including consultants and training and
goods) will be provided to ISKUR and KOSGEB to assist in program implementation
and buildup their capacity.

 (c)    Management, Monitoring and Evaluation:          The objective o f this component is
to monitor the impact of LRS and manage the PSSP2 effectively as a whole.               The
component will finance: (i)  surveys to evaluate the effectiveness o f the LRS inmitigating
the social costs o f labor redundancies resulting from employment and privatization on
selected communities; and (ii)   undertake in-depth socio-economic analyses o f specific
communities where privatization has taken place.

        The component will also finance limited TA and minor goods to: (i)        coordinate
project execution, and manage the resources o f the project; (ii)procure all Bank-financed
goods and services for implementing agencies; (iii)     operate the financial management
system (FMS) according to the Bank's financial management requirements; (iv) act as
liaison between the implementing agencies and the World Bank; (v) ensure that annual



                                         8

 audits are completed in keeping with Bank standards, and (vi) manage the MME studies
 with the technical support of the Directorate General of Economic Research (EKA) in
  Treasury.

4. Lessonslearnedand reflectedin the projectdesign

        The PSSP2 will be the Bank's fifth engagement inthe social protection sector in Turkey
since the early 1990s. The previous Employment and Training Project (ETP) in 1993, PIAL in
1994 were investment and reform oriented projects designed to strengthen the delivery o f labor
services and strengthen institutional capacity and also set the stage for the Government to
downsize the SOE sector inthe longer-term. Whereas, the PSSP in2000 and the SRMP in2001
were designed to support the Government's effort to disengage from production activities and
thus foster the continuing development o f the private sector, reduce the socio-economic impact
o f privatization, and to mitigate the negative impact o f economic instability on poor households
respectively.

        The Bank's past experience inthe social protection sector inTurkey, is rather checkered,
with past macro-economic instability, uncertain political environment and limited absorptive
capacity being the main reasons behind less than optimal project implementation. However, the
presence o f a single party government with its large parliamentary majority may ease some of
the problems that have been encountered in the past and thus expedite privatization. In fact the
Government has announced bold and politically difficult measures to reduce public expenditures
and raise revenues, and to improve overall efficiency. To help achieve the underlyingobjectives
o f improved efficiency and sustained fiscal contraction, the Government is committed to
accelerating the pace o f privatization.     In this regard, the payments anticipated under the
proposed project combine the severance payment as well as job loss compensation.              It is
anticipated that severance payment will be paid on lump sum basis, whereas, job loss
compensation will be paid on a monthly basis. The duration o f JLC will vary according to the
employment history o fthe beneficiary.

        With regardto labor redeployment services, there havebeenmany experiences inTurkey,
both under the ETP, PIAL and PSSP. Experience in Turkey, and other countries indicates that
these services are normally utilized by a small percentage and are relatively low cost as
compared with income support payments.

    The main lessons leamt are:

    (i)     Programs should be carefully designed and targeted to maximize optimum utility.
            For instance, temporary community employment programs should be carried out by
            private sector or NGOs, as an altemative to public agencies. This approach will
            improvejob placement and employment; and

    (ii)    LRS should be sub-contracted on a competitive basis to local service providers,
            which will deliver services on performance contract basis. These contracts should
            include, pre-negotiated job placement rates, as appropriate with related financial
            incentives and payments should be made on agreed unit cost per trainee, and services
            should be made available for directly laid off workers, in addition to secondary lay
            offs. Monitoring will be carried out on displaced workers, so as to find out the socio-




                                                 10

            economic impact o f privatization. Such monitoring has already been conducted in
            Turkey.

5. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection

        Several alternative lendinginstrumentswere considered:

    (a) Supplemental Loan to the Ongoing PSSP: This was rejected as (i) required loan
                                                                                 the
        amount was much larger than the original PSSP and (ii)    there was a need to update the
       PSSP2 inline with revised Bank procedures and financing parameters.
    (b) Technical Assistance Loan: This was rejected as TA needs are relatively small
        compared to the large financial needs o fthe JLC and LRS.
    (c) Sector Wide Approach (SWAp): Inreality, the PSSP2 has many elements o f a SWAp,
       but presenting it formally as a SWAP would have caused delays in the very fast
       processing schedule; in addition, the country procurement system assessment and
       baseline indicators to apply country procurement procedures have not yet been initiated
        for Turkey.

        With regard to design and financing o f specific social support programs, it is recognized
that Government resources are stretched. Several options have been considered by the Bank for
social support, including: (a) targeting all social support resources to one activity (e.g.,
temporary income support or labor redeployment), although experience shows that a combined
approach is much better; (b) looking for alternative resources from other bilateral or multilateral
donors, but none has expressed interest in providing resources o f the nature proposed for the
PSSP2; and (c) targeting the use o f available resources to specifically identified groups to
maximize impact.      Faced with fiscal restraints and broad program choices, the proposed
operation will primarily finance two activities: (a) JLC payments to support privatization and
labor shedding, by providing temporary income support (severance payments), and (b) LRS to
provide labor services to assist displaced workers to returnrapidly to the labor market.

        With regard to the PSSP2JLCpayments, six alternatives were considered, o fwhich only
three (*) are supported by the proposedPSSP2.


    0   Unemployment Benefits:        These payments cannot be financed by Bank investment
        projects.   However, Turkey does have an emergency unemployment benefit which
        became effective in June 2000, and payments began for qualifying workers in March
        2002. The fund i s financed by a 4% insurance premium paid by the state, government
        and employee, and benefits are 50% o f the average o f the last four months salary and for
        a maximumo f ten months.


    0   Social Assistance: Social assistance payments act as a safety-net for those who do not
        qualify for, or who have exhausted, regular unemployment benefits. Social assistance
        payments are often means-tested, or are based on combined indicator targeting (proxy
        means-testing), are household based, and are linked to poverty lines. Turkey does not
        have an adequate social assistance system. However, instituting a poverty benefit is a




                                                11

      complex task.      This i s being supported under the Social Risk Mitigation Project,
      approved by the Board on September 13,2001.


   0  Individual Pension Accounts: These payments amount to a contribution defined pension
      or unemployment benefit system where each worker deposits a portion o f hidher salary
      inan interest bearing account, and inthe case o fjob loss or voluntary separation, he/she
      can withdraw fi-om the account.      Such systems, which are sometimes found in Latin
      America, support labor mobility, and make workers directly aware o f the consequences
      o f poor job performance, but may not compensate workers adequately when job loss i s
      beyond their control. Turkey does not have such a system and the PSSP2 does not
      support suchpayments.


   0  * Regular Severance: Turkey has had a system for some time whereby a worker gets
      one month o f severance pay for each year in service if he or she is displaced during
      privatization or retires. This becomes a liability o f the PA. The proposed PSSP2 will
      finance these payments to workers laid o f fby SOEprivatization.


   0  * Special JLC:      These payments are in addition to regular severance pay, and are
      designed to encourage workers to leave overstaffed SOEs. Payments range up to 8
      months, depending on conditions and length o f service, and payments should bepaid on a
      lump sum basis to encourage investment and not consumption.            Payments normally
      decline in size over time to increase initial impact. Turkey has used this instrument inthe
      past to support job loss compensation during privatization. It i s called the "Job Loss
      Compensation Payment", i s definedin the Privatization Law Number 4046, and provides
      up to eight months o fsalary payments based on years o f service. However, the payments
      were not made in a lump sum in the past, which discouraged investment and had the
      effect o f delaying worker re-entry to the workforce, since payments were stopped if a
      worker took employment. The proposedPSSP2 will finance these payments.


   0  * Early Retirement: This    instrument can have a negative effect on an already indebted
      social security system. Turkey i s inthe midst o f reforming the pension system to reduce
      options for early retirement and to increase the pension age. It should be noted that this
      option may also become more expensive than lump sum ifit is extended to many people,
      and as such should only be applied to workers very near retirement. An alternative is to
      provide "social assistancepayments" to workers who are near voluntary retirement age to
      encourage them to take retirement, as opposed to remaining in SOEs. Turkey has this
      program available for civil servants. The proposed PSSP2 will finance eligible workers
      and civil servants to help ensure that they leave the civil service when eligible and not
      just transfer to other SOEs or other government service.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1.    Institutionalandimplementationarrangements

      The signatory to the Loan Agreement will be the Undersecretariat o f the Treasury. The
primary implementing agency will be the PA under the Prime Minister's Office. Technical



                                                12

implementation of the JLC and LRS components of the project will be managed by a technical
Labor Adjustment Group (LAG) within the PA. EKA within Treasury will assist the P A in
undertaking the program of evaluations and assessments under the MME component.
Administrativeoperations will behandledby the existingPSSP Project Coordination Unit (PCU)
with Financial and Procurement/Reporting functions within the PA. The LAG and PCU
Departments will be headed by civil servants. The Financial Department Head at the PCU, who
will serve as Coordinator of the PCU, will be the primary point of liaison with the Bank. The
following summarizes implementation for each separate component.

         The legal structures o f the Privatization Administration (PA) and the privatization fund
have been re-established with the Law No. 4046 enacted on 27 November 1994. The PA's
duties, responsibilities, and rights, and the fund's resources and utilization fields o f such fund are
determinedinthe provisions o f the related law and PA is designated to manage the privatization
fund.

         According to the Article No.9 o f Law No. 4046, all proceeds obtained from the
privatization process and all dividends obtained from the organizations transferred to the
Administration as well as proceeds obtained from the sales o f securities and other negotiable
instrumentsand documentation, income obtained from the funding suppliedto the organizations
transferred to the Administration, and other resources andearnings allocatedby other legislation,
are credited to the Privatization fund.

         With the amendments made to Law No. 4046 with Law No. 4971, the decision authority
on PA's rights, receivables and liabilities is given to the Privatization HighCouncil (Article 3).

         According to Article 7 o f Law No. 4749, the Undersecreteriat o f Treasury may transfer
the foreign financing facilities obtained from foreign financing sources to public institutions and
organizations outside the context o f general and annexed budget and investment and
developmentbanks through an on-lendingarrangement. Incase of on-lending o f foreign debt, an
on-lending fee o f 0.5% is charged to the related institution. As PA is outside the context o f
general and annex budgetthe proceeds of the PSSP2 loan is provided to PA through a subsidiary
loan agreement. Law No: 4046 and Law No: 4971 do not have any provisions restricting the
borrowing authority o fPA.

         JLC: The PA will identify SOEs qualifying for Bank financing o f JLC based on
Investment Criteria agreed with the Bank (see Annex 6), and will notify the Bank concerning the
name o f the enterprise and the number o f qualifying workers prior to making an application to
the Bank for severance payments. The PA will verify that the SOEs involved meet the agreed
criteria, and that agreed procedures have been followed in calculating the payments (additions
and subtractions to the initially agreed list o f 21 SOEs are to be agreed with the Bank).

         LRS: This component will be coordinated by the LAG within the PA, in close
cooperation with ISKUR and KOSGEB. The LAG will be responsible for: (i)               developing and
maintaining the administrative framework for the LRS; (ii)       taking the lead role, in cooperation
with representatives from two lead agencies, unions, SOE management, and community leaders
to organize in-plant pre-layoff labor redeployment assessment and planning sessions for workers;



                                                   13

and (iii)providing ongoing monitoring of the delivery of labor redeployment services being
administered by the two lead agencies. Actual delivery o f LRS i s to be contracted to local
services providers in keeping with the Project Operational Manuel (POM) and LRS Field
Operational Manual (FOM) as agreed with the Bank.

        Service Providers will invoice the local ISKURor KOSGEB office for services provided
based on agreed contract. If Service Providers desire a mobilization payment they will provide
an Advance Letter of Guarantee. ISKUR and KOSGEB local offices forward invoices on a
monthly basis, or as needed, to the ISKUR and KOSGEB head office in Ankara. KOSGEB and
ISKUR head offices review and forward invoices to the PNLAG Coordinator. The PNLAG
Coordinator reviews and forwards invoices to the P N P C U for payment. The PA/PCU arranges
payments to KOSGEB and ISKURHead Office accounts from the Special Account. The PCU
will then prepare a Statement o f Expenditure and submit it to the World Bank for replenishment
o f the Special Account as needed (replenishment will be at 100% o f the total amount o f LRS
paidas defined inthe LoanAgreement).

        MME: The studies underthis component willbemanagedbythe EKAat Treasury. TA
to implement the studies will be procuredfrom independent firms and/or consultants by the EKA
at Treasury, with procurement support from the PCU.

2. Monitoring and evaluation of outcomes/results

        There will be three main inputs into the monitoring and evaluation of the PSSP2:

        0  Management Information System (MIS): The PA has an ongoing M I S to track the
           results and costs o f the JLC and LRS programs.        This was developed under the
           ongoing PSSP and will be continued and strengthened under the PSSP2.
        0  Evaluation Studies: Under the MME component, three targeted cost-effectiveness
           evaluations on specific activities supported under the LRS components. The intention
           is that these would provide timely inputs on impact and cost-effectiveness so as to
           improvethese programs over time. Inaddition there will be in-depthsocio-economic
           analyses o f areas deeply affected by redundancies resulting from the privatization
           program, which will also aim to suggest local economic development strategies.
        0  Bank Supervision and Mid-term Review: Regular Bank supervision missions will
           focus on monitoring and evaluation, particularly related to the results framework
           presented inAnnex 3. Inaddition, there will be a Mid-tenn Review o f the project to
           beheldbyJune 30,2007 whichwill undertake a full review o fthe PSSP2.

3. Sustainability

        The JLC and LRS components of the PSSP2 are not intended to be sustained over time,
as they are one-time severance payments and LRS are intended to facilitate privatization o f
SOEs.     However, experience gained during operation o f these programs can assist the
government to design and implement additional downstream SOE privatization and civil service
reform programs. The LRS program i s modeled after experience gained in the ongoing PSSP,
and similar programs inthe Eastern Europe, the EUandthe OECD, andwill provide institutional



                                                 14

experience which can be useful for strengthening similar programs for general unemployed after
the PSSP2 is completed. Participation o f the PA, KOSGEB and ISKURinthe evaluation studies
under the MME component is designed to enhance their long-term analytical and evaluation
capacity.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economic and financial analyses

        The privatization program i s expected to have a positive impact on people's lives, but
there will be some areas o f increased difficulty. One o f the main groups negatively affected by
the reforms will be workers laid-off from privatization o f SOEs. Successful privatization in
Turkey requires effective programs to ease the social costs o f large-scale layoffs. A review o f
twelve case studies o f enterprise divestiture in Europe, Latin America, and Asia indicated that
workers, as a whole, did not lose by divestiture, but that individual workers could be worse off,
especially when layoffs or reduced hiringwere involved, as they will be in Turkey. The current
retention o f excess labor lowers labor productivity, increases enterprise losses, impedes
enterprise restructuring, delays the potential reallocation o f labor to productive alternative
employment, and consumes state budget resources in the form o f direct or indirect subsidies.
The total cost o f these subsidies, includingongoing salary payments, can exceed by a significant
margin the one time cost o f JLS and LRS.

        JLC: The proposed PSSP2 is directly linkedwith the Government o f Turkey's overall
economic reform program which will structurally transform the Turkish economy by reducing
state involvement and advancing market reforms.          Many SOEs are characterized by low
productivity-low     output per worker. The PSSP2 will continue to help improve the productivity
of certain segments o f the Turkish industrial sector (in accordance with Bank Operational
Memorandum (OP 6.00) on Financing Severance Pay in Public Enterprises Reform Operations,
with memo updated February 7, 2005).          The following criteria must be met prior to the
investment o f severance being made: (a) that the payment o f severance results in a positive rate
o f return(within a four year period) for a specific SOE or sector. This i s to say, the reduction in
the number o f employees must result in a decrease in overall operating costs without a
corresponding loss in production; (b) that the investment is in accordance with Turkey's



                                                 16

industrial strategy; and (c) that the investment will lead to an overall increase in either
production, profits or exports.       To gain a complete understanding o f post-privatization
productivity gains, it is important to keep inmindthat many SOEs are losing significant amounts
o f money. These losses are a drain on the economy as shown inthe public sector deficits. The
result is higher inflation and higher interest rates, and in general, less private sector investment
than there would be otherwise (crowding out).        Less investment means a reduced growth in
productivity.

        LRS: The basic economic rationale is that moving workers, via labor redeployment
programs, from jobs where they are not productive and receive public subsidies to jobs where
they are productive and do not receive public subsidies reduces public budget outlays and
increases GDP. At the same time, GDP will increase to the extent that the jobs filled by
redeployed workers are new jobs or higher productivity jobs than participants held previously.
The sub-component finances specific services to: (a) improve labor mobility and address
frictional unemployment; (b) enhance and change human capital, via retraining, to address
structural unemployment and improve productivity; and (c) address the lack of demand for
labor, including support to individuals to help them start and maintain micro and small
businesses, and to communities to implement temporary community employment schemes. The
Project provides for monitoring o f the status o f program participants relative to their post-
program employment status, earnings, and receipt o f continued public income support payments.
Specialized counseling, re-qualification training, and improvedjob placement services have been
found to raise productivity by bringing about more efficient matching o fjob seekers and the skill
requirements o f existingjobs. It i s anticipated that the gross impact o f the services will equal or
exceed those found in the study: "Evaluating the Impact of Active Labor Programs: Results of
 Cross Country Studies in Europe and Central Asia" (World Bank Discussion Paper, June I999),
and that post-program employment will be a minimum o f 10% after receipt o f employment
services, an average o f 60% for participants inretraining programs, 20% for vocational training
for those who wants to start their own business, 10% o f employment in temporary community
employment programs, 10% o f those who make initial contact for assistance in starting small
businesses will actually start businesses, and 90% o f those entering business incubators will
continue to operate a small business at the end o f one year.

2. Financial

        The proposed loan o f Euro 360 million will cover 80% o f total project costs. The
majority o f the Government contribution i s contained in the 19% co-financing requiredfor JLC
compensation, the rest inpre lay-offjob counseling services provided by ISKUR. Financing for
the JLC makes up 93.8% o f total project costs, LRS 6.0%, and the MME the remaining 0.2%.
Additional co-financing is not anticipated.       The project is expected to be completed and
disbursedin four years. The PA has beenjudged to be a credit-worthy institution fully capable
of repaying the on-lent funds under the PSSP2 to the Undersecretariat o f the Treasury.

        Fiscal Impact: The PSSP2 will have a large positive net fiscal benefit by supporting
implementation o f the Government's privatization program which is a cornerstone of its
disinflation strategy. The program i s targeted to generate significant privatization revenues in
2005 and a cumulative total of at least US$S billion over the 2005-2007 period (including
telecommunications and energy).        The Government intends to earmark the majority o f the


                                                 17

privatization revenues generated to pay down the stock o f public debt, in particular short-term
debt (i.e., domestic government securities), which have highrates o f interest.

        The PA's privatization agenda is directly supported by the PSSP2. By helpingto ensure
that the PA can deliver its full program, the expected fiscal benefit o f the PSSP2 will greatly
surpass the level o f resources made available under the World Bank loan.

3. Technical

        The proposed PSSP2 builds on the ongoing PSSP inTurkey and successful experience in
similar operations in neighboring countries (Macedonia Privatization Social Support Project,
Romania Employment and Social Protection Project, Romania Social Sector Development
Project, Poland Hard Coal Restructuring) and the costs and lessons learned in the previously
mentioned Turkey PIAL and ETP projects. The two major components o f the project, JLC and
LRS, have multiple internal categories o f expenditure that allow a flexible response to demand
within the two funds, and if needed, adjustments can be made to change allocations between
funds based on demand. Cost estimates for the two major components, JLC and LRS, are based
on analysis o f displacement o f workers from individual SOEs, and actual costs o f these programs
in the ongoing PSSP. These estimates have been carefully reviewed and agreed between the
Government andthe Bank.

4. Fiduciary

        The task team in March 2005 conducted an assessment o f the adequacy o f the project
financial management system at the PCU in the PA. The current financial management
arrangements for the project are satisfactory to the Bank.

        There will be one special account for the project at the Central Bank o f Turkey and
disbursements will be based on traditional disbursement methods.

        All payments to the contractors (except for LRS), suppliers and consultants will be made
from the special account with the authorization o f the Vice President or the Project Coordinator
o f the PCU. Payment orders will be preparedby the Financial Management sub unit o f the PCU
upon receipt o f approval from the LAG within PA. LAG is a group formed o f designated
individuals from implementing entities and they are responsible for the management o f the
technical implementation o f JLC and LRS components. The LAG at PA will prepare reports for
the PCUbased on information submittedto LAGby implementingagencies on the categories o f
payments made under the JLC component o f the PSSP.

        Funds for JLC payments made will be transferred to PA's designated project bank
account after verification of severance pay calculations by P A and receipt o f no objection from
the Bank. The responsibility o f verifyingthe severance pay calculations lies with the committee
established by PA, which will provide a certification before the release o f funds from the World
Bank.

        A procurement assessment was carried out inApril 2005 and is summarized inAnnex 8.
Procurement risks were rated as low. The PSSP2 will benefit from havinga soundly functioning


                                                 18

PCU which is overseeing the implementation o f the ongoing PSSP. Fiduciaryrisks are rated as
low.

5. Social

         The general rationale and social objectives focus on mitigating the short term negative
impact o f privatization of SOEs. The first issue i s to ensure that eligible displaced workers get
the needed assistance, includingtemporary income support and labor services to help ensure that:
(a) they do not fall into poverty, and (b) they rapidly rejoin the labor force. Detailed procedures
have been defined and agreed with the Government to ensure that JLC and LRC are received by
eligible workers. There is already considerable internal experience in making these payments
and operating LRS. The second issue i s to identify sectors and communities negatively affected
by the privatization program, as well as individual workers and families who may be
experiencing special problems inre-enteringthe workforce and coping with economic and social
problems caused by SOE privatization and the economic reform program. Inorder to identify
these negative outcomes, a series o f focused assessments are currently underway under PSSP,
and will continue to be financedby the PSSP2.
         Primary beneficiaries directly involved in the PSSP2 are (a) workers displaced from
SOEs beingprivatized and their families; and (b) collateral worker displacement caused infirms
associated with SOEs where downsizing occurs, in particular in mono-enterprise communities,
andthe general economic reform program. The views o f these workers will be assessedthrough
both informal monitoring andmore formal evaluation underthe MMEcomponent.

6. Environment

         The ECA Environmental Unit has rated the project as "C".                            There are no significant
environmental issues in this Project. However, in the case o f the small business incubators, the
Bank, P A andKOSGEB have agreed that sound environmental and occupational health practices
shall be fully integratedinto the supportprograms for small businesses.

8. Policy Exceptions and Readiness

        As already discussed in Section B.3., the PSSP2 entails an exception to Bank policy in
having a high level o f retroactive financing (Euro 210 million), although this is not retroactive
financing in the normal sense. The PSSP2 i s a direct continuation and repeater project o f the
ongoing PSSP (US$250 million, of which the entire amount has been committed, and will be
disbursed by December 31, 2005, the closing date) and uses the same reimbursement
mechanisms used in the ongoing PSSP. No further funds are available under PSSP for further
JLC or severance, hence the need for PSSP2.

        The ongoing PSSP (Board date December 21, 2000; effectiveness date December 22,
2000) did include provision for retroactive financing in the amount o f US$24 million,
overwhelmingly for JLC to cover the period between July 1, 2000 and effectiveness and which
then became the benchmark starting date for the PSSP privatization program. The reason for the
much larger retroactive payment provisions under the PSSP2 i s that the privatization program,
begununder the ongoing PSSP, has been successful and has been expanded by the government
to add additional SOEs being prepared for privatization or liquidation under the same criteria
applied under the ongoing PSSP1. Under the program the reimbursement o f the JLC only
happens once the trigger (sale o f at least 51% ownership to the private sector or in the case o f
liquidation, liquidation ordinance by the Privatization HighBoard) i s reached. Once reached (as
was the case under the ongoing PSSP and would be the case under PSSP2) the reimbursement
covers the costs o f layoffs made prior to the trigger point to make the privatizing entity more
attractive for privatization. Inthe case o f the ongoing PSSP this related to layoffs runningback
to the beginningo f the program in2000, even ifthe privatization occurred in2000-2005. Inthe
case o f PSSP2, the reimbursement would be made only after the same trigger point had been
reached during the life o f PSSP2 relating to layoffs runningback to January 1, 2003. Thus over
the period January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2004, for those 21 state-owned enterprises to be
privatized or liquidated over the lifetime o f the PSSP2, some 19,619 workers have been laid-off
with total JLC paid by the PA o f US$348.3 million (at the appraisal exchange rate, and with the
proposed Bank disbursement at 81% this amounts to the Euro 210 million provided for in
retroactive financing under the loan). Among these layoffs, only those where the privatization
trigger point is reached under PSSP2 would be eligible for reimbursement, which could occur
from effectiveness until the PSSP2 closing date o f June 30, 2009. It should be emphasized that
this is not retroactive financing in the normal sense in that on effectiveness o f PSSP2, only a
small amount, ifany, will be disbursedon effectiveness o f the loan for layoffs occurring prior to
the effective date. Instead, as was the case o f the ongoing PSSP, the reimbursement only occurs
ifandwhenanentityreaches theprivatizationtriggerpoint duringthe life ofPSSP2.

        The PSSP2 will use exactly the same triggers for the actual reimbursements o f JLC as the
ongoing PSSP. Experience has shown these to be very effective as there (i)             is a robust
verification and checking system inplace, including tracking to ensure that such workers are not
overpaid or re-engaged in the public sector and (ii)    i s a strong incentive to consummate the
privatization or liquidation. There have been no problems o f any kind under the ongoing PSSP,
apart from a slow start in disbursements as the privatization process was affected by the




                                                  20

economic crisis in2001 followed by a period o f political uncertainty culminating inthe elections
inNovember 3,2002.

       Payment of severance under the JLC component i s consistent with the Bank's policies on
Bank Financing OP 6.00 and meets the eight-point test as discussed inSection A.2. Exactly the
same procedures and rigorous verification will be applied as inthe ongoing PSSP (see Annexes 4
and 8). Experience under the PSSP has been excellent as there is a strong tracking system in
place to ensure that only qualified, and truly redundant workers receive JLC.

       Project Readiness: Procedures for operation of the JLC and the LRS are already
functioning fully under the PSSP and are contained in the updated POM and FOM agreed with
the Bank.   Terms o f Reference for TA are already drafted.         Terms o f Reference for the
evaluation studies and assessments have been drafted and will be further developed as needed
during the course of project implementation. Project protocols, satisfactory to the Bank, have
been signed between the P A and ISKUR, KOSGEB and EKA. The FMS on the PCU is fully
functional.

                        TURKEY: Privatization Social Support Project 2

Job Loss Compensation (JLC) Issues:

        Job loss income support programs that support economic restructuring normally combine
the types o f programs that are available to the general unemployed, along with special programs
that are designed to encourage excess labor to leave enterprises undergoing privatization, and
provide temporary income support to these workers as they make the transition to alternate
employment. While each situation i s unique, there are a range o f program choices. The final
design depends on such factors as: general economic conditions, the general level o f
unemployment, the demographics o f the workforce, the conditions o f remuneration o f the
affected workers, the relationship between representatives o f labor, the state, and enterprise
management, and the role o f the enterprise inthe country and community. Isolatedcommunities,
where one employer dominates, are a particular problem. Income support programs can be quite
costly in the short-run (e.g., in excess o f an average o f Euro 10,000 per worker); however, costs
can be reduced significantly ifdisplaced workers are able to find alternative employment rapidly.
Additionally, making one-time severance payments to workers to encourage them to leave an
enterprise i s often less costly thancontinuing to employ them inloss-making enterprises.

        The alternatives for income support can include programs such as unemployment
benefits, social assistance, individual pension accounts, regular severance, special job loss
compensation, early retirement, and share distribution. The proposed PSSP2 will focus on
regular severance, special JLC and retirement social assistance.


    0   Regular Severance: The parameters for these payments are defined in Labor Law
        Number 4857 which kept in effect Article 14 o f the old labor law 1475. This article
        defines detailed eligibility for workers. The annual ceiling is adjusted, is currently about
        four times gross minimum wage, and on one month per year o f service. Workers with
        less than one year o f service are not eligible.


    0   Special JLC: The parameters for these payments are defined in the Privatization Law
        Number 4046, Articles 21 and 22. Payments to workers may be made for up to eight
        months depending on length o f service, and are based on net daily pay o fthe employee as
        calculated inArticles 77 and 78, inthe Social Security Law Number 506.


    0   Social Assistance (Civil Servants): The parameters for these payments are defined inthe
        Privatization Law Number 4046, Article 24. This Law provides a 30% retirement bonus,
        in addition to the payment normally made to retiring civil servants, to those who are
        within two months o f reaching the voluntary retirement age before or at the time o f
        privatization, in order to induce those employees who have sufficient years o f service to
        qualify for retirement, to actually do so. Employees are given two months from the date
        o f privatization to choose this option.      Regular retirement bonuses, in general, are
        calculated on a worker's monthly wage times the number o f years o f service.




                                                  22

Labor Redeployment Services (LRS) Issues:

        Labor redeployment programs are designed to help displaced workers quickly re-enter
the labor force, increase overall productivity, and decrease use o f state-financed income support
payments. These services support, and need to be coordinated with, income support payments.
These programs can have a significant positive impact ifappropriately targeted and well-run
(e.g., services are demand-driven and delivered by service providers which have performance
based contracts).    Experience in Turkey and other countries indicates that these services are
normally used by about one-third to one-half o f displaced workers and are relatively low cost
(e.g., averaging Euro 600-750 per worker) as compared with income support payments.

        A variety o f services are needed to address three conditions commonly experienced by
displaced workers who are trying to re-enter the labor market:


    0   Frictional Unemployment i s experienced by displaced workers who have marketable
        skills for which there i s demand, but need intensive job placement assistance. These
        services can have a substantial positive impact on re-employment and have a low unit
        cost (e.g., Euro 15-30 per worker in Turkey). These services can include assistance for
        remotejob search and relocation.


    0   Structural Unemployment is experienced by displacedworkers who lack skills, or whose
        skills are not indemand, andwho need some re-training to compete and re-enter the labor
        market.     Different types o f retraining, including on-job-training and/or institutional
        training, are needed inthese circumstances and can help redeployment at a moderate cost
        perworker (e.g., Euro 250-400 inTurkey).


     0  Lack of demandfor labor is a particular problem in areas o f highunemployment and in
        mono-enterprise communities which shed large amounts o f labor. Programs include
        small business consulting assistance, incubators, and micro-loans (although the latter may
        not be critical ifsubstantial severance payments are provided). These programs tend to
        be more expensive than other services (e.g., Euro 1,200-1,500 per job created), and
        attract a limitednumber o fparticipants from SOEs (ie., 5-6%), but can be quite effective.
        Temporary Community Employment Programs are also sometimes used. Although the
        social and infrastructure benefits of temporary community employment are recognized,
        these programs must be limited and carefully targeted to the vulnerable because o f the
        highunit costs (e.g., Euro 2,350) and considerable evidence that theyhave no impact, and
        often a negative impact, on post-program employment and wages.               Finally, local
        economic development planning grants, particularly inmono-enterprise communities, can
        have a positive long term impact on job creation and have already been implemented
        successfully inTurkey.

        Specific labor redeployment programs to be supported by the proposed PSSP2 have both
social and economic objectives, and are generally provided for in the Privatization Law 4046,
Article 21. This Article provides a menu o f demand-driven services intended to assist displaced
workers to re-enter the labor market. Services have included a range o f employment creation



                                                 23

programs such as small business assistance programs (excluding micro-credit because o f the
severance payments already provided for), programs which address structural unemployment
including various types of retraining, and programs which address frictional employment,
including specialized job placement services. Unit costs, based on current experience, average
about Euro 600-750, and participation o f displaced workers ranges from 33-45%.               Such
programs have already been implemented under the completed Bank-financed Privatization
Implementation Assistance and Social Safety Net Project (PIAL) and the ongoing PSSP. These
programs are continuing with financing from the PA. Evaluations conducted in Turkey and
neighboring countries indicate that the programs can have a significant positive impact on
employment and wages ifthey are well-targeted and designed.

Social Support Services During Privatization:

        There are potentially two quite different approaches to provision o f social support, and in
particular, severance type income support payments: (a) let the new investor deal with the issue,
or (b) have the Government assist prior to sale o f the SOE.


    0  Investor Driven Layoff:      This approach is one inwhich the new investor will restructure
        the enterprise and address related labor requirements. This assumes that the Government
        will sell the enterprises at a discounted price, if necessary, and let the new owners deal
        with the restructuring and related layoffs. This is the preferred option, as the new
        investor is in the best position to know the labor requirements o f the enterprise which i s
        being purchased.      With this option, there is no Government participation in the
        administration and financing       o f temporary income support and related labor
        redeployment programs. Initial analyses undertakenby the Bank, incooperation with the
        Government, provide an approximation o f the costs that a buyer may encounter in
        reworking the labor force and laying o f f excess employees in specific SOEs. With this
        information "in-hand", the Government has an idea o f how much the price o f the SOE
        would need to be discounted to compensate investors for costs o f excess labor; and the
        investor would have to bear the cost o f minimum regular severance payments defined in
        the Labor Law 4857. Currently, about one-quarter o f privatization actions are being
        organized as "block sales" which include excess labor and discount the sale by a related
        amount.


    0   Government Assisted Layoff:          The above approach may make some SOEs very
        unattractive to buyers, particularly if the enterprises have large numbers o f excess
        workers, and the financial and social costs of layoff are high. Buyers have other
        investment alternatives and may not want to get involved in laying o f f large numbers of
        workers in a heavily unionized environment immediately after purchasing an SOE. In
        addition, the basic severance option under the Labor Law 4857 may not be viewed by
        unions as sufficient reimbursement for layoffs, or be sufficient to encourage and
        compensate workers to leave SOEs at a time when alternate employment i s not easily
        available. The Privatization Law 4046 addresses this issue by providing a framework for
        additional support and labor redeployment services to SOE employees displaced by
        restructuring. Ifthese programs are made available before and at point o f sale, increased
        amounts o f labor may leave voluntarily, the SOEs will be more salable, social issues will



                                                 24

       be addressed by the Government to demonstrate its support to affected citizens, and the
       reaction o f organized labor to the privatization program may be less negative and strident.
       The Government may, in fact, be able to recapture rapidly the cost o f any social support
       programs provided prior to sale by gaining a higher cost from the sale.

      The choice used inthe PSSP2, with regardto job loss compensation and layoffs, will be a
blend o f the two approaches, investor-driven and government-assisted, depending on the SOE
involved. The proposed project will only finance government-assisted approaches. The Bank
and Government have agreed on criteria for the use o f loan funds as follows: the payment o f
severance at the point o f sale will result inproductivity increases due to savings on labor costs,
and these savings are envisaged to be greater than the cost o f severance payments.

Arrangementsfor resultsmonitoring

There will be three main inputs into the monitoring and evaluation o f the PSSP2:


   0    Management Information System (MIS):           The PA has an ongoing M I S to track the
        results and costs o f the JLC and LRS programs. This was developed under the ongoing
        PSSP and will be continued and strengthened under the PSSP2.
   0    EvaluationStudies: Under the MMEcomponent a series o f targeted cost-effectiveness
        evaluations on specific activities supported under the LRS components. The intention is
        that these would provide timely inputs on impact and cost-effectiveness so as to improve
        these programs over time. In addition there will be in-depth socio-economic analyses o f
        areas deeply affected by redundancies resulting from the privatization program, which
        will also aim to suggest local economic development strategies.
    0   Bank Supervision and mid-term review: Regular Bank supervision missions will
        focus on monitoring and evaluation, particularly related to the results framework
        presented in Annex 3. In addition, there will be a mid-term review o f the project to be
        held by June 30, 2007 which will undertake a full review o f the cost-effectiveness o f the
        PSSP2 and reach agreement upon any necessary modifications.

        Institutional issues: Monitoring and evaluation will complement project management
by providing timely information on project progress and cost-effectiveness evaluations o f the
JLC and LRS. This will enable expeditious adjustment o f operations to increase their impact and
effectiveness. A net impact evaluation o f the LRS under the ongoing PSSP i s due in July 2005
and will help improve LRS operations and targeting.

        Data collection: The existing PSSP MIS is based on data drawn from ISKUR and
KOSGEBandhas been found to be accurate. The PA maintains data on actual redundancies and
JLC paid.

        Capacity: Strong capacity now exists in the PA, ISKUR and KOSGEB for regular
monitoring having been built up by the ongoing PSSP. Evaluation capability i s more limited.
Indeed, it is for this reason, and in order to avoid conflicts o f interest, that EKA has been
designated to undertake the evaluation studies. However, the PA, KOSGEB and ISKUR will be
involved directly inthese evaluations with the intention o f buildingup their long-term evaluation
capability.

                         TURKEY: PrivatizationSocial SupportProject2

COMPONENT 1: JLC (Euro 420.1 million, o fwhich Bank =Euro 340.3 million)

OBJECTIVESAND ACTIVITIES

        The goal ofthis component is to improve the productivity o f certain elements o fTurkey's
industrial and services sector (previously SOEs) and to ameliorate the temporary negative social
and economic impact of job loss compensation on workers displaced during privatization of
SOEs.

Objective                                         Activities
1. Severance Payments: to provide severance       (i) Selection and verification of eligible SOEs based on
and related payments, as regulated by law, to     productivity criteria as previously agreed with the Bank.
workers displaced due to privatization o f state-
owned enterprises.                                (ii)Identification of eligible workers to receive severance,
                                                  specialjob loss compensation and retirement social assistance.

                                                  (iii)Calculation of payments and transfer of funds to SOEs,
                                                  ISKURand Emekli Sandigi.

                                                  (iv) Verification of payments to ensure that laid-off or retired
                                                  employees were eligible and received the correct amount.

JLC Investment Criteria: In order to fulfill the Investment Criteria, each of the following
points must be met:

        (a)      That thepayment of JLC results in a positive rate of return for a specific SOE
                 or a sector. A positive rate o f return must be demonstrated within a four year
                 period. This i s to say, the reduction in the number o f employees must result ina
                 decrease in overall operating costs without a corresponding loss in production
                 (e.g., if 50% o f workers are laid off, production must not decrease by an equal
                 amount). The output per person must increase. This criterion can be applied at
                 the firm or sector level where a sector is defined as a group of firms producing
                 similar output, such as the petro-chemical industry.

        (b)      That the investment is in accordance with Turkey's general economic
                 development strategy.         The Government o f Turkey i s pursuing an industrial
                 strategy and five year plan focusing on modernization, increased use o f
                 technology, and privatization.         One example o f this is with respect to the
                 Government's strategy to modernize the textile industry. The Ministry o f
                 Industry has primary responsibility for outlining the Government's industrial
                 strategy. The PA must remain current on what the Government strategies entail
                 and must ensure, prior to making severance payments to particular SOEs, that this
                 investmentis consistent with the Government strategy.




                                                      31

       (c)    That the investment will lead to an overall increase to either production, profits
              or exports at the enterprise or sector level. Point one above focuses on output
              per worker but in addition to this criterion, it is necessary that the enterprise
              provides a business plan that demonstrates that the investment in job loss
              compensation will lead to an increase inproduction, profits or exports. Inmany
              cases, the business plan proposed by the buyer and outlined inthe sale document
              will address all three points.     It was also noted that consultant reports are
              commissioned prior to each sale to help determine the sale price and the future o f
              the SOE.      These reports may also contain information to help verify this
              requirement.) Ifthe firm (or sector) can demonstrate a probable increase inany o f
              these three areas, it will point to a positive return on investment. If this i s not
              demonstrated, the payment o f job loss compensation cannot be financed by the
              PSSP2 2 loan.

Making JLC Payments: The PA will provide financing to: (i)SOEs which will make regular
severance payments; (ii) ISKURwhich will make specialjob loss compensation payments; and
(iii) EmekliSandigi(ES-RetirementFund)whichwillmakeretirement socialassistance
    the
payments according to procedures agreed with the Bank.

Replenishment Applications from the PA: The LAG at PA will prepare reports for the PCU
based on information submittedto LAGby the SOEs, ISKUR, and ES on the three categories o f
payments made under the JLC component o f the PSSP2.             Supporting documentation will
include, at a minimum, the certification by the PA that:

              the Government certifies that the paymentsmeet the investment criteria for use o f
              BankProject funds;

 PRINCIPLES AND CRITERIA -L R S

 1.      General Criteria

         Availability of LRS Services to Communities: LRS funds will finance active labor
 programs in all provinces where privatization has occurred since January 2003, and where
 privatizationwill occur duringPSSP2.

         Availability of L R S Services to Individuals: LRS services will be provided to
 individual citizens through local service providers selected by public advertisement. LRS funds
 will finance active labor programs for displaced previously and/or to be displaced by SOE
 privatization in all provinces where privatization has occurred since January 1, 2003, and where
 privatization will occur during PSSP2, as well as secondary unemployed in provinces where
 privatization o f enterprises and factories, which had and have absorbing place in the economy o f
 provinces, have occurred and will occur. Provinces where LRS will be delivered shall be
 determinedby the PA. Priority will be given to workers to be displaced or displacedpreviously
 by SOE privatization.

         Allocation of LRS Services:         The LRS i s demand-driven. However, the maximum
 amount o fthe LRS that can be used at the national level for Temporary CommunityEmployment
 Services i s 25%.

         Selection and Reimbursement to Service Providers: Public advertisement i s required
 to select service providers which propose programs, after public announcement o f the
 availability o f funds, and those that meet minimum evaluation criteria may be accepted for
 financing (detailed contracting procedures for procurement o f services are contained inAnnex I,
 Section 111, o f the POM. Reimbursement to service providers will be based on the contracted
 average unit cost per client (i.e. man-hour, man day, or manmonth) times the number o f units o f
 client services which are delivered.       Service providers are eligible for limited mobilization
 payments to a maximum o f 20%, 30% for incubators, but will thereafter bill for services
 provided on a monthly or as neededbasis.




                                                   34

        Duplication of Payments and Services: Individual clients can receive income support
payments from the LRS even if they are receiving other types o f state-financed income support
(e.g., unemployment benefits, job loss compensation payments). Individuals may not participate
inboth training and temporary community employment programs financed under the LRS, and
cannot participate inthese programs ifthey have participated insimilar programs financed by the
EUinthe last 24 months.

        Evaluation of Services:         The impact o f services is to be evaluated by all service
providers as a condition of their contracts. Service providers must report on the status o f clients
at the end o f each program and/or when a client terminates a program, and before final invoices
are paid (e.g., did clients get jobs after services, did they start businesses, what i s their wage
and/or income). Some service contracts (e.g., training, small business assistance, employment
counseling) will have built-in incentives to improve labor market impact (e.g., negotiated levels
of job placement and business start-up, with financial incentives to meet objectives, and
disincentives ifobjectives are not met).

        Labor Mobility: Mobility i s to be encouraged by providing information, by the sharing
of information on services being provided in different regions, by re-location grants that can be
provided through employment service contracts, and by allowing qualified individuals from one
region to participate inprograms beingprovided inother regions.

                              Annex 6: ImplementationArrangements
                       TURKEY: PrivatizationSocial SupportProject2

        As notedpreviously, the proposedPSSP2builds on directly relatedexperience inTurkey.
One of the key lessons learnedis that the overall management o f such projects is best handledby
an agency that i s very close to the issues at hand, can use the operation to directly further its
goals, i s flexible, and i s sufficiently broad in its charter to oversee the overall project. The P A
has acted as the coordinating implementingagency for the PSSP, and will continue in this role
for the proposed PSSP2. The PA has considerable current and past experience working with
Bank-financed projects, as well as dealing with the type o f operations financed by the proposed
PSSP2. ISKUR, KOSGEB and EKA have signed protocols with P A for the PSSP2. These
agencies have day-to-day responsibility for sub-contracting and managing labor redeployment
service providers: ISKUR for counseling, retraining, and temporary community employment
services; and KOSGEB for small business assistance and incubators. These agencies are very
familiar with these programs and are implementing them on an ongoing basis, both with
Government and Bank financing. Social impact activities would be contracted directly by PA
with independentthirdparty consultants underthe technical guidance ofEKA.

         Two small management groups have been established at PA for the PSSP, which will
continue to administer the PSSP2: one for "back office" project fiscal, procurement, reporting,
and liaison with the Bank (PCU), and the LAG which will handle technical monitoring and
administration of the JLC and LRS components. A Tripartite Advisory Committee (TAC) has
already been established to advise on overall policy related to project implementation.

        Executing Agencies: The PA i s the primary implementing agency for the project.
Technical implementation o f JLC and LRS will be managed by the LAG o f the PA. The LAG
will be comprised o ftechnical experts, and will closely coordinate the management o f LRS with
ISKUR and KOSGEB. Administrative operations o f the project will be handled by the PCU
with financial, procurement and communication units. The PCU will serve as the "business
centre" o f the project and as the liaison for communication between the Bank and the PA, and
between the P A and the other implementing agencies o f the project. The PCU as well as the
LAGwill be headedby individuals who have a civil servant status. The PCU, together with the
LAG, ISKUR,KOSGEB and EKAhave updatedthe POM, inagreement with the Bank. The PA
will use this POMas the chief instrument to manage andmonitor project implementation.

         The following understandings were reached with respect to arrangements for project
implementation, monitoring, and mid-term review.             The P A would be responsible for the
implementation o f the JLC component. The execution o f the LRS component will be carried out
by ISKURand KOSGEB. Whereas, the MME component will be implementedby two entities:
(a) the assessment and evaluation activities by EKA; and (b) project management by the PCU
located at the PA. During implementation close coordination will be arranged amongst the line
units.The Mid-termReview will be completed by June 30,2007.

         Project Management: The proposed PSSP2 will be managed by the PCU in the PA.
The PA has the administrative and managerial experience in running intemationally funded
projects. The current PCU established at the PA will have overall coordination responsibility for


                                                    42

the project and in this regard will work closely with the lead implementing agencies o f the
project. The P C U will be headed by an individual who has a civil servant status and will be
composed o f (i)   financial officer, (ii)reporting and communication officer, and a (iii)  team
assistant. Since procurement will be of a very limitednature, this either will be handled by one
of the above mentioned officers or by a short term consultant. The PCU will have translation
and interpretation services as necessary. The project will finance project management training to
assist with organization and hnctioning o f the PCU.

        The PCU will be responsible for monitoring implementation progress o f the project, and
thus preparing quarterly project management reports. In addition, the PCU will be responsible
for ensuring that financial statements, special account, and the SOEs are audited annually by
auditor(s) acceptable to the Bank, and in accordance with auditing standards acceptable to the
Bank.

        On-Lending Arrangements: The proceeds o f the loan will be on-lent to the P A by the
Undersecretariat of the Treasury under the same terms and conditions as the loan providedby the
Bank.

       Procurement issues: The JLC does not entail any procurement.            LRS involves the
competitive procurement o f services according to the procedures outlined in the POM. The
small amounts o f office furniture, materials and equipment will be procured through National
Shopping (NS) and International Shopping (IS). Consultants' services will be procuredthrough
a combination o f local QCBS, Consultants Qualifications (CQ) and Individual Consultant (IC)
procedures. Training will be procuredbased upon a comparison o f at least three quotes.

        Tripartite Advisory Committee: A Tripartite Advisory Committee (TAC) will be
established to oversee the policy aspect o f the proposed project and thus ensure its alignment
with the Government's privatization agenda. The TAC will comprise with representatives of the
Treasury, PA, State Planning Organization, ISKUR, KOSGEB, State Institute o f Statistics,
TOBB, TESK, Confederation o f Turkish Employer Association and Labor Unions. The TAC
will meet at least once a year, and will report to the PA.

Summary of Financia1Management Arrangements

         The task team conducted an assessment o f the adequacy o f the project financial
management system in March 2005 at the PCU in the PA. The current financial management
arrangements for the project are satisfactory to the Bank.

         A summary of the conclusions for the project financial management purposes are as
follows:

Country Issues

         A Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) for Turkey was carried out in
2001. The CFAA report identified major weaknesses in the Turkish financial accountability, in
both the public and the private sector. Since 2001 the financial management environment has
improved in Turkey. In December 2003, the Public Financial Management and Control Law
(PFMC) which establishes the legal framework for harmonizing and modernizing budgetary
practices across all government agencies is enacted in the Parliament. It reduces fragmentation
and provides for a more comprehensive presentation o f the budget. The law also allows for
future decentralization o f financial control to spending agencies.       Originally PFMC was to
become effective inJanuary 2005, but it i s now postponedto January 1,2006.

         The legal structures o f the Privatization Administration (PA) and the privatization fund
have been re-established with the Law No. 4046 enacted on 27 November 1994. The PA's
duties, responsibilities, and rights, and the fund's resources and utilization fields o f such fund are
determined inthe provisions o f the related law and PA i s designated to manage the privatization
fund.

         According to the Article No.9 o f Law No. 4046, all proceeds obtained from the
privatization process and all dividends obtained from the organizations transferred to the
Administration as well as proceeds obtained from the sales o f securities and other negotiable



                                                  45

 instruments and documentation, income obtained from the funding supplied to the organizations
 transferred to the Administration, and other resources and earnings allocated by other legislation,
 are credited to the privatization fund.

          With the amendments made to Law No. 4046 with Law No. 4971, the decision authority
 on PA's rights, receivables and liabilities i s given to the Privatization HighCouncil (Article 3).

          According to Article 7 o f Law No. 4749, the Undersecreteriat of Treasury may transfer
 the foreign financing facilities obtained from foreign financing sources to public institutions and
 organizations outside the context o f general and annexed budget and investment and
 developmentbanks through an on-lending arrangement. Incase o f on-lending o f foreign debt, an
 on-lending fee o f 0.5% is charged to the related institution. As PA is outside the context o f
 general and annex budgetthe proceeds o f the PSSP2 loan i s providedto PA through a subsidiary
 loan agreement. Law No: 4046 and Law No: 4971 do not have any provisions restricting the
 borrowing authority o f PA.

 Risk Mitigation Strategy

           Countryfinancial management risk: The CFAA has identified major weaknesses inthe
 Turkish financial accountability, in both the public, private and the banking sector. These risks
  together with the developments in the sector incurred after the preparation o f CFAA has been
  explained in detail in the "Country Issues" section. The project will be coordinated by the PCU
 that is established inPA and is currently coordinating the ongoing PSSP.




                                                    46

Financia1Management in Privatization Administration

        The privatization fund administered by PA uses the Uniform Chart o f Accounts as
specified in the Ministry o f Finance's Communique No.1 on accounting procedures, dated 26
December 1992. The P A i s not a tax entity and therefore is not subject to the Law No. 5024
requiringincome tax and corporate tax payers to make inflation accounting adjustments to their
financial statements thus the financial statements o f the fund are prepared on historical cost
basis.

        The financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003 are reviewed
by the Bank. The PA balance sheet as of December 31, 2003 shows 37.0% equity, 52.1% short
term liabilities and 10.9% long term liabilities. Furthermore, 86.6% of assets are long-term
assets, and 13.4% are current assets. The long-term assets are mainly share values of institutions
transferred to the PA for privatization.    A total o f 71.0% o f the long-term liabilities were
payables to Treasury and these payables were fully paid back to Treasury as o f December 2004
as per Higher Audit Board report. The operational income of PA is generated from the sale of
institutions inthe portfolio.

         The financial statements o f the fund and PA's activities are audited annually by the
Higher Audit Board. The Higher Audit Boardreport prepared for the year ended December 31,
2003 has been reviewed by the Bank and there were no issues specified by the auditors relating
to the financial management and controls.

Implementing Entity

         The project will be implementedby the PA, ISKUR, KOSGEB and EKA. There is a
PCU inthe PA led by a project coordinator who reports to the Vice President of PA. This PCU
currently works as the coordinating unit of the ongoing PSSP and they will continue to be the
PCU for PSSP2. The PCU will be responsible for overall project coordination, procurement,
financial management, contract management, monitoring, and evaluation and reporting.
Currently, the PCU includes, in addition to the Coordinator, a procurement department head, a
financial management specialist, a reporting and communications specialist and an
administrative assistant. The PCU intends to hire a short-term consultant to perform initial
procurement duties for PSSP 2.

         The risk associated with the implementing entity is assessed as negligible.

Funds Flow

         There will be one special account for the project at the Central Bank o f Turkey and
disbursementswill bebased ontraditional disbursement methods.

         All payments to the contractors (except for LRS), suppliers and consultants will be made
from the special account with the authorization o f the Vice President or the Project Coordinator
o f the PCU. Payment orders will be prepared by the Financial Management sub unit o f the PCU



                                                47

upon receipt o f approval from the LAG within PA. LAG i s a group formed up o f designated
individuals from implementing entities and they are responsible for the management o f the
technical implementation o f LRS component.           The LAG at PA is also responsible for
management o f JLC component of PSSP2. The LAG at PA will prepare reports for the PCU
based on information submittedto them by implementing agencies on the categories o fpayments
made under the JLC component o f the PSSP.

        The PA has established a committee for the verification o f severance pay calculations
prepared by the SOEs. This committee provides a certification before the release o f funds from
the World Bank to the PA. The committee also makes site visits to the SOEs to verify original
personnel records and latest payroll statements, on a sample basis, to ensure completeness and
correctness o f the severance pay calculation. The same committee will be responsible for the
verification o f severance payments under PSSP 2.

        Funds for severance payments made, which is the major project component, will be
transferred to PA's designated project bank account after verification o f severance pay
calculations by PA and receipt o f no objection from the Bank. The responsibility o f verifying
the severance pay calculations lies with the committee established by PA, which will provide a
certification before the release o f funds from the World Bank.

        The PCU will have the overall responsibility for the management of the special account
and will make the required payment from the special account as well as the required accounting
entries into the financial management system.

        Therisk associated with theflow of funds is considered as negligible.




        Based on the discussion held with the officials o f the PA, it is confirmed that the current
structure o f the ongoing PSSP will be retained for PSSP2, since the present PCU has been
providing support successfully to all components of the ongoing PSSP.            The present PCU
consists o f a project coordinator (a civil servant) and three consultants covering the positions o f
(i)Finance, (ii)  Communication, (iii) assistant. In addition to these, the PCU intends to
                                         Team
hire a short-term consultant to deal with initial procurement requirements o f the project as well
as interpretation and translation services as necessary.         Staff working in the Financial
Management Department o fthe PCU are very experienced and have satisfactory qualifications.

        Therisk associated with StafJingis considered as negligible.

Accounting Policies and Procedures

        The project accounting will be maintained separately within P C U and the project
accountingwill be on a cash basis.

        The PCU has been using accounting sofiware for PSSP. PMRs were generated by the
system and were received by the Bank on time. However, this system had some deficiencies



                                                  48

addressed by the auditors in their reports. Such deficiencies are (i) o f existence ofjoumals
                                                                      lack
for transactions entered into the system, (ii)
                                             impossibilityo f displayingthe openingjournal ofthe
year even when all closing entries are made properly. To respond to auditors' requests and for
other practicalities, the PCU has purchased a new Financial Management System (FMS) for
PSSP 11. The new FMS will be used for project accounting, monitoring and reporting. The
project financial management specialist has developed the chart o f accounts and prepared the
draft project financial managementmanual.

        Therisk associated with accountingpolicies andprocedures is considered as negligible.

Internal Controlsfor the Job Loss Compensation

        The main component o f the project i s the JLC (Euro 420.1 million) in which P A will
provide financing to: (i)SOEs which will make regular severance payments; (ii)      ISKURwhich
will make special JLC payments; and (iii) State Pension Administration (ES) which will
                                               the
make retirement social assistance payments according to procedures agreed with the Bank and
the Bank will reimburse 81 % o f such payments to P A following the below controls;

        The Labor Assistance Group (LAG) at PA will prepare reports for the PCU based on
information submittedto LAGby the SOEs, ISKUR, and ES on the three categories o fpayments
made under the JLC component o f the PSSP2. Supporting documentation will include, at a
minimum, the certification bythe PA that:

                the Government certifies that the payments meet the investment criteria for use o f
                Bank Project funds;

                the three categories o f separation payments have been made in accordance with
                the documents originally submitted by the enterprise, and that in each case an
                audit has been done by the LAG, except for very small enterprises, (less than 100
                workers) as agreed with the Bank;

                the calculations are consistent with entitlements as set out inthe Labor Law 4857
                for severance payments; Privatization Law 4046, Articles 21 and 22 for special
                job loss compensation, and Privatization Law 4046, Article 24 for retirement
                social assistance;

                any JLC payments found through the audits and verifications conducted by the
                LAG which have been financed by the PSSP2 made to terminated workers who
                have been re-employed by the privatized SOE, or who are employed as temporary
                workers by the government will be deducted from the reimbursement application
                made next following the date o f the audit, and

                the procedures established by the PA to ensure a transparent, arms length sale to
                one or more private sector purchasers have been adhered to with regard to the
                qualifying SOE, and procedures defined in the agreement o f sale are being
                implemented.



                                                 49

Internal Audit

        Currently there i s not an internal audit unit at PA. The PFMC law requires the
establishment o f internal audit unit at PA and the full implementation o f PFMC will start in
2006. Untilsuch structure is established no reliance will be placed on internal audit.

Reporting and Monitoring

        The PCU will maintain records and will ensure appropriate accounting for the funds
provided. Financial statements for the project will be prepared by the PCU. The FMR will be
prepared quarterly and will be submitted to the Bank no later than 30 days after the end o f the
quarterly period.

        The present PCU at PA had been submitting FMRs for PSSP in the agreed format, and
those reports were satisfactory to the Bank. The formats and contents o f those FMRs will be
retained for PSSP 11. The FMR for PSSP I1will also include financial reports, output monitoring
reports and procurement reports. The financial management manual o f the project includes a
section on the FMR.The FMS is capable o fproducing all these reports.

        Therisk associated with reporting and monitoring is assessed as negligible.

Information Systems

        The PCU has purchased a new Oracle based FMS that will be used for project
accounting, monitoring and reporting. The FMS is capable o f generating financial reports,
procurement reports andwill also be used for contract management.

        The risk associated with information systems is assessed as negligible.

Strengths and Weaknesses

        The significant strengths that provide the basis o f reliance on the project financial
management system are: (a) centralization o f all project financial management functions at the
PCU; and (b) experience o f the PCU with the ongoing PSSP.              There are no significant
weaknesses inthe project financial management system.

Supervision Plan

        During project implementation, the Bank will supervise the project's financial
management arrangements intwo main ways: (i) the project's quarterly FMR as well as
                                                   review
the bank and project's annual audited financial statements and auditor's management letter; and
(ii)duringthe Bank's supervisionmissions, review the project's financial management and
disbursement arrangements (including a review of a sample of Statements o f Expenditures and
movements on the Special Account) to ensure compliance with the Bank's minimum




                                                50

requirements. As required, a Bank-accredited Financial Management Specialist will assist inthe
supervision process.

External Audit:

        The audit o f the project financial statements will be carried by Treasury Controllers in
accordance with International Standards on Auditing and under TOR that will be cleared by the
Bank before negotiations.

        Treasury Controllers have submitted their latest audit report on the ongoing PSSP on
M a y 31,2004 for the year-end December 31,2003. The auditors gave an unqualified opinion for
PSSP project financial statements both for the year ended December 31 2003 and 2002. The
issues underlined in their management letter refer mainly to problems related to the software
used for accounting and reporting purposes. Those issues are expected to be eliminated with the
purchase o fthe new software for PSSP2.

         The risk associated with external audit is assessed as negligible.

                             Annex 8: ProcurementArrangements
                       TURKEY: PrivatizationSocial SupportProject2

A.       General

        Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with the World
Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated M a y 2004; and
"Guidelines: Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May
2004, and the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. The various items under different
expenditure categories are described in general below. For each contract to be financed by the
Loan, the different procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need for pre-
qualification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time frame are agreed between the
Borrower and the Bank in the Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan will be updated at least
annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in
institutional capacity.

B.       Procurementof Goods

         Goods procured under this project would include several small packages o f shopping
contracts comprising office equipment and supplies for the implementingagencies and the PCU
with a total amount of Euro 313,000.

C.       Selectionof Consultants

         The Borrower will select and hire consultant firms for socio-economic evaluations o f JLC
and LRS, Social Impact o f Economic Changes on Communities andManagement o f Consultants.

         The Borrower will also select and hire large number o f individual consultants to provide
technical assistance to PNLAG, ISKUR, and KOSGEB on different TA tasks.

         Consultant services also comprise the TA to support implementation of the project by
employingPCU staff.

D.       SpecialSelectionArrangements:

         Procurement for LRS with an aggregate amount o f Euro 14.00 million may be procured
 under contracts awarded inaccordance with the provisions o fparagraph 3.17 o fthe Procurement
 Guidelines, following criteria and procedures acceptable to the Bank as described in the POM
 and its Annex 1.

E.       Assessment of the agency's capacityto implementprocurement

         Procurement activities will be carried out by the existing PCU established in 2001 under
the PA within the context o f ongoing PSSP. The PCU is composed o f a PCU Director, FMS
Specialist, Reporting and Communication Specialist and a Team Assistant. The P C UDirector i s
a public officer and the other PCU staffs are all consultants. An assessment o f the capacity o f



                                                 53

the PCU to implement procurement actions for the project was carried out by the Procurement
Accredited Specialist in March 2005. The assessment reviewed the organizational structure for
implementingthe project and found out that the size andcapacity o fthe current PCUrunningthe
ongoing PSSP project i s adequately satisfactory to implement the PSSP2 project provided that a
procurement specialist i s recruited. Due to the replication o f the ongoing PSSP project, it is
recommended to implement the PSSP2 with the current PCU Director, FMS Specialist,
Reporting and Communication Specialist and a Team Assistant in order to keep the institutional
memory, experience and continuation o f the project. It i s recommended that the contracts o f the
current PCU staff employed under the ongoing PSSP project will be renewed with the terms and
conditions to be agreed for the PSSP2 project when expired in December 31, 2005 under the
ongoing PSSP project. If a public officer in the capacity o f a procurement specialist will be
assigned by the PA to the Project, in this case he/she would be sent for training organized
preferably by ILO at TuridItaly, for further development o f procurement o f consulting services
underthe Bank's procurementprocedures.

        The initial overall project risk for procurement i s rated low. The risk rating will be re-
evaluated after one year o f Loan effectiveness and adjustment will be made accordingly.

        Duringthe project launchworkshop the Bank will organize a training program for the PA
and PCU personnel who may be involved in the procurement activities to introduce the Bank's
Guidelines and standard biddingdocuments to be used inthe implementation o fthe project.

F.       ProcurementPlan

         The Borrower, at appraisal, developed a procurement plan for project implementation
which provides the basis for the procurement methods. This plan has been agreed between the
Borrower and the Project Team on April 4,2005 and i s attached to Appendix 8. There is no I C B
Works and Goods Contracts in the procurement plan. Among the other minor procurement
items, it consists o f Community DrivenDevelopment contacts amounting Euro 14.00 million and
one QCBS consulting services contract estimated to cost Euro 916,000 and several individual
consultant contracts amounting to Euro 2,342,000.         The procurement plan will be updated in
agreement with the Project Team bi-annually or as required to reflect the actual project
implementation needs and improvements ininstitutional capacity.

G.       Frequencyof ProcurementSupervision

         Contracts not subject to Bank's prior review will be post reviewed by Bank's supervision
missions and/or during regular post-reviews by the Procurement Accredited Staff on sampling
basis, i.e. one out o f every five contracts. The frequency o f procurement supervision should be
every six months inthe first year o fthe project and once ina year inthe following years.

                           Annex 9: Economic and FinancialAnalysis
                       TURKEY: Privatization Social Support Project 2

        The PSSP2 i s directly linked with the Government o f Turkey's overall economic reform
program which will structurally transfonn the Turkish economy by reducing state involvement
and advancing market reforms.          Many state-owned enterprises are characterized by low
productivity-low    output per worker. This key benefit o f the PSSP2 is to help improve the
productivity o f certain segments o f the Turkish industrial sector (in accordance with paragraph 3
o f the OM on Financing Severance Pay in Public Enterprises Reform Operations, updated
February 7, 2005, which states that "severance pay should be an integral part of the project
aimed to make an enterprise or sector more productive").                 Only those SOEs that can
demonstrate: (a) an expected positive rate o f retumon the investment o f severance within a four
year period (i.e., the reduction in the number o f employees must result in a decrease in overall
operating costs without a corresponding loss o f production; (b) that the investment is in
accordance with Turkey's industrial strategy; and (c) that the investment will lead to an overall
increase to either production, profits or exports at the enterprise or sector level.

        Moving workers via severance payments and from jobs where they are not productive
and receive public subsidies to jobs where they are productive and do not receive public
subsidies reduces public budget outlays and increases GDP. The overall efficiency o f the
economy will be enhanced helping Turkey to complete globally and also to meet the market
economy tests for EU accession. Public budget outlays will decline to the extent that redundant
workers who are to be redeployed to new jobs now receive indirect or direct government
subsidies. Evenifdisplaced workers are not successful infindingproductivejobs, public budget
outlays will decline if, as expected, the costs o f labor redeployment measures, including
temporary income support, are less than the cost o f the subsidiesto keep workers inunproductive
jobs. At the same time, GDP will increase to the extent that the jobs filled by redeployed
workers are new jobs or higher productivity jobs than they would otherwise have been.
Specialized counseling, re-qualification training, and improvedjob placement services have been
found to raise productivity by bringingabout more efficient matching o fjob seekers andthe skill
requirements o f existingjobs.

        Main Assumptions: JLC: production from privatized enterprises will be maintained at
levels that are equal, or are sufficiently high, to offset the costs o f severance payments to reduce
labor costs. LRS: investment in labor redeployment programs results in a net positive impact on
job placement.

        Cost-effectiveness indicators: JLC: The reduction in the number of employees, must
show an expected positive rate o f return on the investment o f severance within a four year
period, and must result in a decrease in overall operating costs without a corresponding loss o f
production.

        LRS: the job placement rate for workers participating in labor redeployment programs
will be equal to or betterthan those insimilar programs inTurkey andthe region.

                                 Annex 10: Safeguard Policy Issues
                       TURKEY: Privatization Social Support Project 2

       No safeguard policy issues are involved. However, in the case o f the small business
incubators under the LRS, environmental and occupational health and safety international best
practices will be included inthe support and training givento enterprises.


       The PSSP2 is in compliance with the Bank's policy on tobacco in OP 4.76, first the
PSSP2 provides no direct funding to the tobacco sector. Second, there is no reason to believe
that the privatization o f the state tobacco monopoly will lead indirectly to increased production,
although this can not entirely be ruled out.        Moreover, under the Agricultural Reform
Implementation Project, the Bank i s supporting crop diversification for tobacco farmers and
tobacco production has been declining. The support provided to workers made redundant in the
tobacco sector as a result o f privatization i s an inseparable part o f the overall privatization
program and the Bank's support to mitigate the social costs thereof. Moreover, such workers can
benefit from training and other labor redeployment services to help them find sustainable
employment outside o f the tobacco sector.
