through the financing of new\n            investments in private or newly privatized enterprises in\n            need of fresh capital for expansion or restructuring; (ii)\n            support the Government's objective of promoting\n            competition in the financial system by helping strengthen\n            the institutional capacity of participating commercial banks\n            (PCBs); and (iii) foster  development of a market of medium\n            and long-term financing of investment projects.  The\n            project's component will be a line of credit to PCBs to\n            be on-lent to private sector enterprises.  These sub-loans\n            may be used to finance capital investments and may include\n            up to a 20 percent component of associated working capital."}, "docdt": "1997-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
