Country and Sector Background:
Experiencing rapid economic changes, with a more open economy and a
dominant service sector (approximately 75t of employment), Argentina
requires more and better qualified workers. In this scenario,
adequate education of the workforce is even more crucial to achieve
higher employment rates and ensure the country's international
competitiveness and continued growth. The Province of Buenos Aires,
with more than 13 million habitants and producing about 35 W of the
national GDP is particularly affected by the new market
requirements. Based on a survey of private employers, a 1997 study
concluded that prerequisites asked from the applicants have been
substantially raised due to the new productive process and the
growing competition in the labor market. The completion of secondary
education is now a minimum requirement to enter formal employment.
The main sector issues in the Province of Buenos Aires are: (i) To
increase secondary level coverage, efficiency and equity; (ii) to
improve the quality and relevance of education; and (iii) to make
sector management more efficient.
Project Objectives:
The main objectives of the project are to:
(1) Increase the completion rate of secondary level students.
(2) Improve the learning process at the school level.
(3) Improve the skills of secondary graduates in order to facilitate
entrance in the labor market.



Project Description: The project will have two components:
(1) Expansion of access: includes (i) increasing secondary education
coverage and the transition rate between the third cycle of EGB
(from 7th to 9th grade) and the new polimodal level (from 10th to
12th grade); and (ii) improving the capacity of polimodal schools to
retain students by making the school more attractive to the youth.
This will entail building 2,000 classrooms for the 9th grade of the
new EGB3 (last cycle of basic education) and rehabilitating 227
targeted schools to accommodate the growing demand for polimodal and
receive new educational resources.
(2) Quality and Relevance Improvement: includes (i) assisting
schools in their transition to the new curriculum; (ii) improving
school management by supporting the development of school
institutional plans (PEI) with an emphasis on educational
objectives; (iii) providing in-service training and technical
assistance for teachers and school administrators; (iv) bringing
more resources to the school level by improving the efficiency of
the sector administration; (vi) restructuring technical schools
through the provision of educational resources and teacher in-
service training that are up-to-date with market needs; and (vii)
establishing school-based extracurricular programs for the youth.
This component will be targeted to 250 unprivileged and
educationally at-risk schools.
Project Financing: Bank financing is US$ 120.4 million loan and
counterpart financing is $ 51.0 million.
