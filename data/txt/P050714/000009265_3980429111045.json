Education Project\n            aims to: i) increase access to third cycle of  basic\n            education and polymodal secondary level; ii) improve the\n            learning process in the targeted polymodal schools; and iii)\n            improve the skills of polymodal graduates in order to\n            facilitate entrance in the labor market.  There are three\n            components in this project.  First, expansion of access\n            includes construction of classrooms for the 9th grade of the\n            new EGB3 (third cycle of basic education, from 7th to 9th\n            grade), rehabilitation of EGB (basic education) schools, and\n            construction of school bathrooms in the EGB schools.\n            Second, quality and relevance improvement will cover\n            institutional strengthening at the school level;\n            restructuring technical schools through the provision of\n            up-to-date educational resources and in-service teacher\n            training; and establishment of school-based extracurricular\n            programs for youth.  Third, project administration will\n            expand the Project Implementation Unit (UEP), which is\n            responsible for the compliance with Bank's financial\n            monitoring and auditing requirements."}, "docdt": "1998-03-12T00:00:00Z"}
