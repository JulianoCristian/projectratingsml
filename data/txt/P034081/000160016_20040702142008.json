      outcome is highly satisfactory; sustainability is highly\n            likely; institutional development impact is substantial;\n            Bank performance is satisfactory; and Borrower performance\n            is highly satisfactory. The Xiaolangdi project (stages I and\n            II) is the largest Bank-financed project in China to date.\n            On the international scale, it was a very challenging\n            project because of its huge size, predominantly large\n            underground caverns, high degree of technical difficulties,\n            and complex subsurface conditions. Principal lessons learned\n            from the Project include the following: a) High risk/high\n            reward projects can be effectively implemented with the\n            right skills on the Bank side, and high commitment by the\n            client to good organization and competent management,\n            combined with the judicious use of international technical\n            assistance and review. b) Implementing a project of the\n            magnitude and complexity of Xiaolangdi will be greatly\n            assisted if the implementation organization is in place\n            prior to the start of the project. It should be independent,\n            have full decision-making authority and be accountable and\n            responsibility for implementation performance. c) The\n            separation of the large and complex technical and civil\n            works construction activities from large resettlement\n            activities into two separate project operations worked very\n            well and contributed to the effective and successful\n            implementation of both. It allowed both the Bank and the\n            implementation agencies to concentrate their resources and\n            efforts on the two activities, as separate operations. This\n            provides valuable lessons for the Bank on how to manage\n            large-scale resettlement associated with a major\n            infrastructure investment. d) The establishment and\n            maintenance of effective forum for communications amongst\n            various parties (owner, engineer, designer, advisors and\n            contractors) should be actively pursued from the onset, to\n            avoid misunderstandings that could cause delays and /or\n            losses to the project. Communication difficulties were\n            perhaps the most difficult to resolve in construction of the\n            Xiaolangdi scheme. e) The use of the International Panel of\n            Experts substantially reduced the time for resolving\n            conflicts in understanding technical problems. (f)\n            Experience suggests that an International Panel of Experts\n            for environmental management was necessary to ensure\n            successful implementation of EMP, especially for large-scale\n            projects with significant environmental management risk. g)\n            The use of the Environment Supervising Engineer and\n            International Environmental Panel clearly demonstrated that\n            all environmental issues were observed early and corrective\n            actions were taken. h) The use of Disputes Review Board to\n            resolved claims issues proved to be extremely useful and\n            resulted in most claims being expeditiously resolved. i)\n            Training of staff on all aspects of implementation prior to\n            the start of the project - scheduling, construction\n            supervision, contract management, claims management and cost\n            control averted many of the problems and issues encountered\n            in the project, especially with the international\n            contractor; j) Training of staff prior to completion of the\n            project in financial management, business management and\n            tariff negotiations added significantly the sustainability\n            of the project."}, "docdt": "2004-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
