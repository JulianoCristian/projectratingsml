The project's overall plan and\n            its components remain essentially unchanged from that\n            described in the 1993 EA (report no. E30). The XLD project\n            is designed to protect downstream population settlements,\n            farms, and infrastructure from the hazards of disastrous\n            floods; and to achieve a major expansion in downstream\n            irrigation, providing sufficient electric power and water\n            supply to support urbanization/industrialization, to enhance\n            estuarine ecology, and to expand aquaculture. The\n            environmental protection components include the relics\n            protection program; the disease control and protection\n            program; dam stability against earthquake hazards; air,\n            water, and land quality impacts; and impacts on natural\n            vegetation and animals, on rare and commercial species, and\n            on villages around the sites. A detailed archeological\n            exploration, classification, and salvage program has been\n            undertaken to locate, recover, and protect important\n            underground and surface relics and cultural treasures in the\n            area to be inundated. After excavation, objects with value,\n            like earthware, stoneware, etc. will be repaired and stored\n            in museums. The rest, like tomb, ash pit, etc., will be\n            recorded in writing and photographed for further study.\n            According to the evaluation, the main components of objects\n            with historical values will be removed and relocated, if\n            possible, and those which cannot be removed, will be sampled\n            and recorded. A number of serious public health concerns,\n            especially communicable diseases, pose significant problems\n            if protective measures are not taken. The project could\n            significantly increase the hazards of malaria, encephalitis,\n            hemorrhagic fever, and enteric diseases. Measures for\n            control of mosquito vector diseases in the construction zone\n            include: medical screening of all workers; periodic spraying\n            of all buildings in construction work areas and camps; and\n            periodic monitoring of pertinent mosquito species larvae.\n            The hemorrhagic fever control program is based on\n            controlling mice and rat density; and includes medical\n            screening examinations and annual examinations for all\n            construction workers. The mitigation program for enteric and\n            other disease control in the construction zone involves\n            maintaining sanitary conditions in the construction work and\n            living areas, including safe water supply and adequate\n            liquid and solid waste management, and air pollution\n            controls. To address dam safety in the event of earthquakes,\n            a special seismoscopic network is needed to carry out\n            seismic monitoring, allow information feedback, and provide\n            proper earthquake prediction. The assessment determines that\n            either minimally negative or -actually- positive effects\n            will result from the Yellow River's lower flows and\n            less turbid water for the following: freshwater fishery,\n            water quality, land accretion, landslides, reservoir\n            seepage, development of the wetlands, and changes in\n            biodiversity. Reservoir formation will inundate sizable\n            deposits of mineral resources, but the only potentially\n            significant loss would be of coal; however, because the coal\n            lies beneath impermeable shale strata, some mining of it\n            will remain feasible after inundation. Among the number of\n            rare and protected species in the reservoir and in the\n            surrounding area, only waterfowl will be directly affected,\n            their populations possibly increasing. A properly planned\n            flood control system includes not only constructing and\n            operating physical flood control works, but also flood\n            forecasting and an emergency response system. Finally, a\n            detailed resettlement plan is elaborated."}, "docdt": "1997-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
