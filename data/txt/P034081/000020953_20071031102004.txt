About this Report
       The IndependentEvaluationGroup assesses the programs and activitiesof the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensurethe integrityof the Bank's self-evaluationprocess and to verify that the Bank's work is producingthe
expected results, and second,to help develop improveddirections, policies, and proceduresthroughthe
disseminationof lessonsdrawn from experience.As part of this work, IEGWBannually assesses about25 percent of
the Bank's lending operationsthroughfield work. In selectingoperationsfor assessment,preferenceis givento those
that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevantto upcomingstudies or country evaluations;those for
which ExecutiveDirectors or Bank managementhave requestedassessments; andthose that are likely to generate
importantlessons.
       To prepare a Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project files and other
documents, interview operational staff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government,
and other in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and
in local offices as appropriate.
       Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporates the comments as
relevant. The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to
the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to
the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEGWBRatingSystem
       IEGWB's use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWBevaluators all apply the same basic method to
arrive at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion
(additional information is available on the IEGWBwebsite: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
       Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's
objectives are consistent with the country's current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project's design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
       Risk to DevelopmentOutcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
       Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangementsfor regular operation of supported activities after loanlcredit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
       BorrowerPerformance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

PREFACE

        This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for four projects that
cost US$3.2 billion and included four loans and two credits to the People's Republic o f
China over the period 1994-2005.

        The Xiaolangdi MultipurposeProject was designedas atwo-phase operation. The
initial Xiaolangdi Multipurpose Project (Loan 3727), estimated to cost US$2,294.0
millionat completion o fthe secondphase, was approved inApril 1994 for a loan o f
US$460.0 million andwas closed on schedule inDecember2000 fully disbursed.The
Xiaolangdi Multipurpose Project I1(Loan 4200) was approved inJune 1997 for a loan o f
US$430.0 millionat which time total project costs haddecreasedto US$2,855.8 million.
The project was closed as scheduledinDecember 2003 when US$80.5 millionwas
cancelled. Total project cost at closing was US$2,688.8 million.

        The TarimBasinI1Project (Loan 4341 andCredit 3093), estimated to cost US$
272.6 millionwas approved inJune 1998 for a loan o fUS$90.0 million and a credit o f
US$65.6 million.US$2.67 million of the loanwas cancelled inSeptember 2001. It closed
inDecember 2005 one year later thenplanned, andwas fully disbursed.Total project cost
at completion was US$287.8 million.

        The LoessPlateauWatershed RehabilitationProject, estimatedto cost US$252.4
million, was approved inMay 1999 for a loanof US$lOO million and a credit ofUS$50
million. The project closed after a six month extension inJune 2005 and was fully
disbursed. Total project costs at completion were US$240.2 million.

        Thisreport is basedonthe variousMemoranda andRecommendationsofthe
President, a Staff Appraisal Report and Project Appraisal Documents, loan documents,
project files (both at the World Bank headquartersand inthe China Country Office),
ImplementationCompletionReports anddiscussions with Bank staff. An Independent
Evaluation Group (IEG) missionvisited China inOctober-November 2006 to discuss the
effectiveness of the Bank's assistance with the central government agencies, development
partners, representatives o fprojects' implementingagencies inthe provinces and
governorates, and stakeholders and farmers inthe field. The cooperation and assistance of
central government officials, managementand staff o fthe implementingagencies, other
stakeholders andproject beneficiaries i s gratefully acknowledged.

        ThisPPAR is part of a series of assessmentsofwater and environment projects in
China that were selected for detailed evaluation to inform IEG's Country Environmental
Case Studythat i s a key inputto IEG's global evaluation to determine the Effectiveness of

SUMMARY

        The four projects assessed inthis report provide a great range o f experience
central to the Bank's assistance for sustainable landand water planning and development
inChinaduringthe period 1994-2005. Eachofthe projects hadtwo phases; however, this
assessment includes bothphases o fthe Xiaolangdi Multipurpose Purpose Project, the
Second Loess Plateau Watershed Rehabilitation and the Tarim Basin I1Projects. The
Xiaolangdi Resettlement Project that resettled 184,000 people i s the subject o f a separate
IEGassessment.

         The four projects were designedto provide integrated management o f land and
water resources withintwo o f China's 9 major river basins. They addressedthe issues o f
water allocation and water use efficiency for agricultural andnon-agriculturaluses, flood,
sediment control and salinity management, andinstitutions for operations and
management o f infrastructure. The Loess Plateau I1project and the Xiaolangdi Projects
are both situated inthe Yellow River Basin and the benefits o fboth phases o f the Loess
Plateau Project directly accrue to the Xiaolangdi dam located downstream. The Tarim
Basin i s located inthe far northwest inXinjiang Autonomous province and i s the only
large river basin completely within a single province.

         The SecondLoess Plateau Project's objectives, to help achieve sustainable land
development by increasing agriculturalproductionand incomes and improving ecological
conditions inthe tributary watersheds o fthe Yellow River, were fully achieved with few
shortcomings. Relevance o fthe objectives was high.However, the designthat uses
afforestation as a secondary instrumentfor sediment control (after terraces) may not be
wholly appropriate giventhe increasing shortages o f water inthe Yellow RiverBasin.
Replicatingthe experience o f the first project, the second project terraced sloping land
and afforested heavily eroded slopes, installedcheck dams and successfully imposedbans
on grazing. Incompensation fanners were helpedto attain more productive and profitable
agriculture including forest products, orchards and forage for a substantially increased
number o flivestock enterprises. While fanners' incomes increased, the extentto which
this is the result ofthe project is difficult to discern due to problems withthe designand
implementationo fthe monitoring and evaluation system. However, more efficient and
sustainable use o f landand water resources reduced sediment inflows to the Yellow River
by an estimated 53 milliontons duringthe life o fthe project, andthis i s projectedto
continue at a slightly lower rate indefinitely.

         Overall economic rates o freturn (ERR) varied from 18 percent to 21percent,
close to the appraisal estimate o f 21 percent. The slightly highervalues include the
benefits from sediment reduction and carbon sequestration. Although the methodology
usedto calculate the ERR i s exemplary, this assessmentbelieves that productioncosts are
underestimated and benefits are overestimated due to the presence o f other donor and a
substantial number o f Chinese-financed local developments that fostered increased
productivity and incomes. Inaddition many rural roads benefitingthe project were
constructed by other agencies. This not only changed market opportunities but also
provided improved accessto off-farm employment, better education and health.

        The outcome o f the project i s rated as satisfactory. Bank performance i s rated as
satisfactory and Borrower performance i s rated as highly satisfactory. Risk to
development outcome i s rated as moderate. There are few local level funds to repair
extensive storm damage to terraces and farmers' incentives to maintainterraces at their
own expense may bejeopardized by the availability o f substantial subsidies for this
purpose inadjacent areas under centrally-funded programs.

        The Xiaolangdi Multipurpose Projects' objectives inboth phaseswere fully
achieved with cost savings. Floodprotectionwas providedto Henanand Shangdong
provinces downstream and included productive infrastructure, towns and 103 million
people mainly inthe rural areas o fthe North China Plain. Sediment accretion inthe 800
kmlower reach ofthe Yellow Riverhasbeenhaltedandthe riverbedhas beenlowered
through the planned release o f artificial floods from the reservoir. The Yellow Rivernow
flows continuously to the sea, unlikethe late 1990s when the downstream reacheswere
dry for upto seven months a year. Water supply to several large and mediumcities,
major industrial centers and downstream irrigation are effectively regulated by the dam.
Muchneededhydropower to meetthe peak power requirementsinthe Henan Gridwas
supplied, albeit slightly behindschedule-but generation now exceeds appraisal
estimates.

        Although water supply for irrigation has been improved, it i s below targeted
levels because o f overall water shortagesinducedby water tariffs that do nothing to
reduce consumption, and upstream water diversions inthe Yellow RiverBasin. In
addition the provincial government failed inthe second phase to increase power tariffs
according to covenants and full-cost pricing o f water released for downstream use has not
beenimplementedby the Yellow River Conservancy Commission.

         Overall efficiency o fthe project i s assessed as substantial. The ERR at completion
was 13 percent compared with 20 percent at appraisal. The primary reason for the
reduced ERR i s that the volume o f dry seasonflow and sediment inthe Yellow Riverhas
declined since appraisal inresponseto growing upstream withdrawal and increasing
frequency o f droughts. This, inturn, has lowered benefits from hydropower, agriculture
and sediment control. Evenso, the benefits from power and urbanwater supply are
probably underestimated becausewater and energy are underpriced and none o fthe
benefits fi-om the improvedecological conditions downstream and inthe delta are
included.

         The outcome ofthe first phaseproject that focused on construction i s rated as
highly satisfactory. The outcome o fthe secondphasethat focussed on facility
management i s highly satisfactory. Bank performance i s rated as highly satisfactory for
bothphases. Borrower performance i s highly satisfactory for the Phase Ithat focused on
construction management, financing and application o f safeguards. Phase I1performance
i s rated as satisfactory becauseo f slow progress on institutional reform and water pricing.
Because o f water allocation and pricing issues, Riskto development outcome i s ratedas
significant. This i s due to increasing water shortages inthe river basin, an administrative
water allocationprocessthat takes no account o fthe economic value o f water and i s
subject to political manipulation, and water pricing that substantially undervalues water
and distorts its utilization.

        The Tarim BasinI1Project successfully contributedto increasing incomes of
poor farmers through development o f irrigated agriculture and drainage infrastructure and
establishment o f institutionsto ensure sustainable use, development and management o f
water resources and landinthe Tarim Basin. The extent farmers' incomes were improved
bythe project is uncertaindue to attributionissues not captured bythe monitoringand
evaluation system. The downstream effects o f integrated land and water management and
the resultingwater savings may have assistedthe resumptionof flow inthe lower Tarim
River that hadbeendry for the last 30 years. The uncertainty is becausethe impact of
secular changes inclimate andrainfall inthe regionwere not considered by the
monitoring and evaluation system. Evenso, restored river flows rejuvenated the natural
riverine forests with substantial ecological benefits.While mechanisms were put inplace
to regulate water tariffs, lack o fpolitical will frustrated needed increases.

        The ERRfor the overallproject was 19percent at completion compared to 14
percent estimated at appraisal. This assessmentbelievesthe actual ex-post economic rates
o f returnusingthe same economic and financial models could be closer to the appraisal
estimate. This i s becausethe cost stream for the ex-post ERR only captured costs directly
attributable to the project and fully attributed all benefits to these inputsalone. Yet we
know that other international sources o f funding supported development inputswhich
directly or indirectly benefitedthe project, as did China's own regional investments.In
addition, there were manyregional, prefectural and country inputs that also benefitedthe
project -such as China's own comprehensive agricultural development program.

        Project outcome is ratedas satisfactory. Bankperformance was highly
satisfactory and Borrower performance i s rated as satisfactory. Riskto development
outcome i s rated moderate. Agriculture inthe basin i s heavily reliant on cotton and grains
and their price is subject to markedannual fluctuations due to global factors. Continued
provincial government subsidieskeepwater prices low. This could underminethe water
conservation efforts promoted by the project as well as the financial sustainability o f
water user groups set upto manage local operation and maintenance o fproject
infrastructure.

         These projects provide three main lessons:

         0  The Bankneedsto elevateits engagement in China's water resources
            policydiscussions above the provinciallevelto emphasizethe perverse
            incentivesthat are created by extensive agricultural water subsidies.
            Subsidies for irrigation and land managementjeopardize water conservation
            effort, longer term sustainability o f irrigation and land reclamationprojects
            andwater availability for towns, cities, industryandenvironmental
            management. Despite more thantwo decadeso fBank partnershipand several
            state-of-the art projects piloting new approachesthese tendto be enclave
            projects. While Chinese senior planners and politicians at the center
            acknowledge that pricing should play a role inensuringmore efficient and
            rational allocation and use o fwater this i s still as at an early stage o f
            applicationand far from politically acceptable inthe provinces. Without such

                                 xiv


a change inthe near future water shortages and environmental consequences
o fresource mismanagement will continue to grow to crisis proportions.

Monitoring and Evaluation requirescapacity building and reorientation
to measureoutcomes and impacts.There i s little virtue inimplementing
development models for reclaiming degraded lands or for river basin
management ifimpacts on welfare, incomes and the economy cannot be
accurately measured. While this i s less o f a problem for physical
achievements it i s a major problem for measurement of socio-economic
outcomes and impacts. Muchmore attention has to be givento understanding
the appropriate counterfactual and ensuringunbiased sampling. There i s also
an issue around selection o fthe most effective M&Emodel considering the
outcomes expected andthe cost o fthe projects. Appropriate training to redress
the problems found inM&E i s clearly indicated. Inaddition, more attention
shouldbe givento fully utilizing existingChinese resources. The Ministry o f
Finance has indicated that it has a national network of monitoring that include
socio-economic indicators and that consideration should be givento working
with themto triangulate evaluative findings.

Muchgreater care is required indealingwith issues of attribution when
estimating ex-post economic rates of return. Specifically this means clearer
definition o fthe project counterfactual and a systematic accounting o fthe
effects o f exogenous actors and investmenton project impact. Without such
attention to these exogenous factors there i s a danger that estimated ERRS
give a false impression o fproject impacts. This, inturn, may lead to incorrect
lessons on development effectiveness and the efficacy o fpolicy, institutional
andengineeringmeasuresutilizedto achieve development objectives.

1. BACKGROUNDAND STRATEGIC CONTEXT

1.1       After the establishment o fthe Peoples' Republic o f China in 1949 government put
flood control and the planned utilization o f its water and land at the top o f its agenda.
Together these would buildfood security and contribute to China's industrialization. Great
importance was attached to establishing river basinagencies for the Yangtze, Yellow and
the Huaihe rivers and inthe 1960sthree more were added-the Haihe, Pearl and Songliao
river basins. Subsequently groups o f smaller riverswere classified inthe Southwest,
Southeast and Inlandriver basins bringingthe total to nine.Early efforts focused primarily
on large-scale, multi-purpose infrastructure development programs aimed at flood
prevention, waterlogging control, irrigation, hydropower, navigation, and industrial and
urbanwater supplies.Thus for example inthe Yellow River basin 156 Sino-Soviet projects
were outlined by 1952andthe FirstPeople's Assembly approved in1955the first
comprehensive and capital intensive utilizationplan for the whole basin that focused on
power generation and flood control through the construction o f 46 large dams.' Similar
multi-purpose master plans were developed for the Huaihe (1956), Haihe 1957), Yangtze
(1958), andPearl (1959).

1.2       Although the capital intensive approach waned duringthe 1960s, subsequent water
development proceededunder reduced central government support usinglower cost,
locally-funded projects. The start o f de-collectivization and the HouseholdResponsibility
System inthe 1980sgreatly increased farmers' incentives and productivity but also ledto a
markedreductioninstate andlocal government funding for routine operation and
maintenance o f large irrigation infrastructure as demand for municipal and industrial
investmentgrew. Withthe increasing maintenance backlog many irrigationprojects
became unreliable, water use efficiency declined and national irrigation area contracted
evenwith newconstruction.* Despiteyield improvements, bythe mid-1980sgrain
production had stagnatedas the area sown decreasedby nearly20 percent. Subsequently
this was redressed by greaterinvestmentinthe agricultural sector and water mana ement,
and introduction o fthe Provincial Governor's Responsibility Systeminthe 1990s!              By
the mid-1990s agriculturalproductivity rose to meet government's targets.

1.3       Despite these set-backs, between 1949 and 1990the number o f large and medium
dams grew from 23 to over 3,000, over 200,000 kmo f flood embankments were
constructed and China's irrigation area expandedfrom18 millionto 48 millionha or about

20 percent o fthe world's total. As stated by H e Changhui, Assistant Director General o f
FA0 in2 0 0 5 ~"China has made thegreatest achievements in water resources development
                    ~
and conservation.Feeding 22percent of the world'spopulation with only dpercent of the
worlds water resourcesand 7percent of the worIdS arable land -as well as lifting 200
millionpeople in rural areas out ofpoverty in the short time span of 20years - is a
testimony to its success. Thecontribution of China to worldpoverty alleviation andfood
security is remarkable." These remarkable achievements, however, came at considerable
cost to the environment.

Environmentalimpactswere large

1.4      Ownership o fwater i s deemedto be the property o f all citizens and the state. Under
such a property regime water was exploited as an open-accessresource on a first-come,
first served basis. While more rationally plannedcentrally-funded projects led development
upto the 1970s, thereafter the provinces, municipalities andtown ships increasingly
utilized local water resources for their own benefitusingmainly their own resources, be it
free labor and/or local finance. A consequenceo f this was the declining quality o f
management and stewardship o fthe nation's water and landresources.

1.5      Between1949 and 1998 per capita water use increased 130percent andtotal water
use by 430 percent. Demandfor industrial and municipal water grew more than three times
faster than that for agriculture.6 The unevengeographical distribution o f water resources in
China compounded the problem; the six northernriver basins contain 44 percent o f China's
population, two-thirds o f its cultivated areabut only 13 percent o f its water resources. Thus
inthe northwater availability, increasingly reducedby droughts andupstreamdiversions
for agriculture and industry, i s a major constraint to economic development althoughthis
has not always beenthe case.79 Management o f floods andwater pollution are among the
major challenges inthe south-east.

1.6      Over-exploitationo fwater resources inthe Tarim Basin inthe arid northwest ledto

Tarim River ceasedto flow with considerable adverse impacts on ecology and regional
biodiversity.lo

1.7      The adverse effects of generations ofpoor uplandmanagement amplifiedby
population pressures have also seriously affected China's landresources. Nationally about
5 billiontons o f soil i s eroded each year from an area o f about 3.6 million km2 or about
one-third of China's territory. Over halfo f all erosion is attributedto poor water
management inuplandareas augmented by overgrazing and loss o f native vegetation."
Worst affected areas include the loess plateau and the redand black soil areas o f
northeastern and southern China. About half o f all soil erosioni s inthe Yangtze River
Basin, and a third inthe Yellow River Basin. The impacts are substantial. Flashier
monsoonal runoffincreased flood hazards and sediment inflow into major rivers. Reduced
soil water storage affects dry-season vegetation and agriculture.

1.8      Farmers' copingmeasures such as increasing rangeland livestock have only
exacerbatedthe problem. InGansu, for example, overgrazing o f grasslands and
desertification has reduced the Maqu Wetlands along the Yellow River from 70,000 to
20,000 ha.'* Since the 1960s, increased soil erosion has reduced reservoir storageby about
10% and reduced navigable waterways from 172,000 to 108,000 km. Andthe bedo fthe
Yellow and many other rivers are elevated above their floodplains because o f excessive
deposition o f sediments that greatly increasesthe risk o f flooding. There i s also a very high
correlationbetweenthe 217 counties with a highincidence o frural poverty and dwindling
soil productivity - 87 percent o fthese counties suffer from soil er~sion.'~Restoring
degraded landsand their vegetation also provides a cost-effective tool for carbon
sequestration o f a scale that could have significant global benefit^.'^ Thus tackling the
causes o f soil erosion not only reduces the risk o f floods andextends the life o f expensive
hydraulic infrastructure but also benefits China's poorest farmers.

1.9      The Yellow River is hugelyimportantto China. One innine (over 130million)
Chinese live within the Yellow River Basin, and most o fthese people depend, directly or
indirectly, onthe river for their livelihood. The river descends 4,450m over its lengtho f
5,500 km, draining an area o f 800,000 square kmandtraversing nineprovinces andor
autonomous regions en route to the Yellow Sea inthe Gulfo f Bohai. A large area o fthe
North China Plain outside the Basinalso depends on the Yellow River for water supply.

1.10    The Yellow Rivercontains the highest sedimentconcentration of any river inthe
world - at times and inplaces it can resemble a mudslide a mile or more inwidth. Violent
storms inthe middlereaches o fthe river can leadto sedimentconcentrations o f more than
400 kgper cubic meter.The middlereach includes the Loess Plateau which contributes 90
percent o fthe river's sedimentload.

1.11    The aggraded lower reach is already dangerously elevated, inplaces more than 10
meters above the surrounding plain. Silt accumulation causes the river bedto rise
inexorably and as a result flood embankments have to be raised at the rate o f one meter
every 10 years. There are 1400 km o f dykes along the banks of the lower reaches o f the
Yellow River. The lower reach contains most o fthe irrigated land inthe basin and i s the
most productive interms o f agricultural output. However the lower reach suffers from three
handicaps: inperiods o f shortage it i s last inline to receive water; it i s most prone to
flooding; andit must deal with most o fthe silt deposited inthe river from upstream
regions.

1.12    Since the start o frecorded history, floods along the Yellow Riverhave killed
millions, disruptedthe lives o ftens o f millions, and have caused incalculable property and
economic losses. Efforts to control it go back 4,000 years. Since the founding o fthe PRC,
extensive systems o f dams and dykeshave beenbuiltto preventfloods, and there has not
beena single serious breach inthe past 50 years. Butthese defences would have been
insufficient to contain really major floods, such as that o f 1843, which i s estimated to have
produced a peak flow o f 35,000 cubic meters a second at Xiaolangdi. Floods may strike
virtually anywhere inthe basin, both inlate summer as the result o f intense rainstorms, or
even inthe dead o fwinter as ice formations dam the northernreaches o fthe river inInner
Mongolia and lower reaches near delta. Flood and sediment control are closely linkedand
without sedimentcontrol, effective flood control may be impossible.

1.13     O fthe total historical average15annual runoff o f 58 billion cubic meters inthe
Yellow River basin, about 30 billion cubic meters are drawn off for various uses, including
transfers to cities outside the basin. There has been a water supply shortfall o f about 3
billion cubic meters inrecent years, compared to total demand, despite the additional
suppliesmade available as a resulto fthe constructionofthe Xiaolangdi reservoir. About 6
millionhectares are irrigated by the Yellow River and its tributaries,o fwhich 2 millionha
are inthe lower reaches which are the most productive due to the temperate climate that
allows year-round cultivation.l6

1.14    Earlierconcerns that Yellow Riverfloods would bethe dominant management
challenge inthe north also appear misplaced. A series o f seven large dams has effectively
providedprotectionagainst the 60-year flood. Evenso, excessive sedimentation has
seriously reduced flood storage capacity. The Soviet-designed Sanmenxia dam designed for
hydropower and flood control was effectively abandoned inthe late 1980s as most o f its
storage capacity hadbeenfilled by sediment-the new Xiaolandgi dam downstream has
now taken over these functions.

1.15     Droughts have recently been a greater problem than floods. While the seasonal
dryingo fthe lower reach o fthe Yellow Riverinthe period 1972-1990 occurred for an
average o f 50 days in21 o f 27 years, by 1997 the lower 704 kmbelow Kaifeng was dry for
over 226 days. Outflow to the Bohai Sea occurred for only 27 days. L o w flow, for
example, in 1995 reduced water availability to Dezhoucity by almost half forcing limited
production or suspension o f 139 industrial enterprises. Reduced availability o f surface
water and low levels o f irrigation efficiency inthe north increasedthe demand on
groundwater that has yieldedsubstantial economic benefits givenits greater reliability
more efficient use. Insome areas o fthe north China plain, however, this has ledto resource
miningas demand exceedednatural replenishment, especially inurbanareas. Inthe past 20
years groundwater levels have fallen typically by 10to 50 meters causing land subsidence,
saline water intrusionincoastal areas, and disrupteddrainage systems.l7

1.16     Although the issue o f flood management appears to be no longer a major problem
inthe north, thisis notthe caseinthe southandcentralparts ofChina. Excessiverainfall
over the Yangtze River basin in 1998 causedthe worst floods o fthe century killing 3,000,
making 14 millionhomeless and costing China $24 billion ineconomic losses. Although
1999 was not as wet, further extensive flooding occurred as stressed levee systems failed.
The subsequentofficial enquiry attributed the impact to the loss o fflood plain storage due
to development andsedimentinfilling, reduction o fupstream forest cover by half since the
1950s and a marked increase insoil erosion.18Indeed, some experts fear that short-sighted
economic exploitation o fthe land resources within the Yangtze River basin could cause it
to become another Yellow River as 41 percent o fthe Yangtze basin's area suffers from
sever soil erosion problem^.'^ Some o f the economic loss and human suffering was because
encroachment on the floodplain following removal o f flood levees by local govenunent. 2o
And 960,000 people at riskinfour provinces withinthe basinhave beenremoved from
flood diversion and retentionareas since 1998.

1.17     The pollution from increased agriculturalproduction, domestic andindustrialuse
also reducesthe availability o f good quality water. More than a third o f China's lakes are
highlypolluted. In2004 only a quarter o fChina's riverswere inthe highestwater quality
category; conversely a third were classified as highly polluted. Although industrial
discharges are large and highlypolluting, this has been effectively re ulated since 199S21
but severe problems remain, particularly for drinkingwater sources?' Pollution is worst in
the north and east especially incities due to lack o f urbanwaste water treatment.
Agriculture i s a close second to municipal areas as a source o fpollution, specifically the
difficult to treat non-point source pollution from fertilizer andpesticide runoff and
livestock waste.23

1.18    China's RehabilitationMeasuresPrecededBankInvolvement.Since the 1970s
the objective o f landmanagement has changed from a primarily productive focus to one in
which it i s recognized that they also provide environmental services -particularly for water
management and reductionof desertification. According to MWR by the endo f 2005
almost one millionha o f erosion mitigationhadbeenimplementedincluding 0.4 millionha
o fwatershed improvement and 0.6 millionha o f ecological re~toration.~~China
implementedtwo complementary approachesto reducingerosion: (a) reducingthe causes
o f erosion by halting the loss of uplandvegetation and forests and (b) restoring degraded
landscapes.

1.19    Starting in 1978, the government o f China launched massive forestry and
agroforestry programs to reverse deforestation and landdegradation, including the "Three
North" project, located inthe aridand semi-arid zone o fthe northwest, north central, and
northeast China. Thanks to these large investmentsintree plantation and shelterbelt
development and a natural forest logging banmanagedby the State Forestry
Administration, China has successfully turnedthe tide o f formerly rapid deforestation.
Evenso, regulationand enforcement remainproblematic becauseo fperverse local
incentives associatedwith the Provincial Governor's Responsibility System."

1.20    On a much smaller scale, integrated watershed management was specifically
targeted by the MWR since the early-1990s. Implementedthrough its Department o f Water
and Soil Conservation activities include participation o frural households inafforestation,
small dam construction and terracing o f landto reduce water erosion.

1.21    Inview ofproblem discussed above there were six broadissuesneedingurgent
attention where the Bank's global experience was relevant:

         1. Water resourcesplanning and allocationusingeconomic criteria and
             instruments;
        2. Flood, drought, irrigation and sedimentmanagement;

         5. Land and soil conservation, salinity control and watershed management; and
        6. Pollution control and management.

The Bank's China Strategy

1.22    Improving China's environmental and water management was an important
component o fthe Bank's Country Assistance Strategies (CASs) from 1995 to 2006.
Initially these CASs envisioned environmental improvements as a result o f the broader,
market-oriented reforms, more efficient infrastructure and improved institutions. It was
expected that these reforms would bringprice changes to reflect the true cost o fnatural
resourcesand encourage greater resource use efficiency. Later CASs aimed to improve the

environment by helpingto shift China from its dependence on industry, which has beenthe
main source o fpollution duringChina's growth over the last three decades, by encouraging
the growtho fservice sectors, enhancing marketefficiency andimproved institutionsfor
water management and utilization.

1.23    The 1995 CAS sought to assist China's sustainable growth challenge through
"easing long-standing constraints to growth by alleviating infrastructuralbottlenecks,
particularly inthe energy, transport, water, and communications sectors; andcurbing the
spreado f environmental problems amidst rapid urbanizationandthe flurry o f development
activities." Specifically, the Bank Group's objectives and assistancestrategy were to assist
China achieve macroeconomic stability while maintainingrapid and more efficient growth,
and sustainthis growthby shiftingresourcestoward priority areas, including environmental
protectionandpoverty reduction. Assistance for the rural sector focused on sustainable
landuse, including the development and management o f forest resources, improved land
use on degraded and marginal soils, development o f newwatershed management and
protectionmodels, and safer drinkingwater.

1.24     The 1997 CAS maintained the same objectives but shiftedthe emphasis.
Responding to increasing pressures onthe environment from the rapid industrial, urban
growth and increased agricultural intensification, the Bank continued with a strategy o f
financing investments for near-term environmental quality improvements. But it also aimed
to strengthenChina's institutions, namely the SEPA and its policies. New objectives for
rural investmentswere introducedsuch as integrated coastal zone management and
pollution reduction were added to the older ones, such as irrigation and water management,
forest conservation and biodiversity.

1.25     What distinguishedthe 2003 CAS from earlier ones was that more innovative

particularly becausethe lothFive-Year Plan(2001-05) gave special attentionto
instruments and a wider range o f them were neededto assist China meet its objectives,

environmental issues. Environmental deterioration and the declining productivity o f many
natural resources were associatedwith poverty and unsustainable productionpractices,
especially inthe environmentally fragile and poorer central and western provinces. While
the CAS'Sfirst pillarwas growth-oriented and sought to improvethe business environment
and helpto accelerate the transitionto a market economy, its second pillar addressed
concerns about regional imbalances and poverty. Poorer and disadvantaged people and
lagging regions were to be addressedthrough investmentlending inrural development,
infrastructure and social sectors. These included improvements to water, land and natural
resource management.

1.26     The maturing o fthe Bank Group's relationship with China is reflectedinthe 2006
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). Inadditionto continuing the Bank Group's assistance
on reducing poverty and mitigating rising inequality between coastal and inlandprovinces,
the CPS aims to deepen assistance for financial intermediationand improvements inpublic
andmarket institutionsto facilitate China's integrationinto the world economy. Onthe
environment, increasing the efficiency of energy generation and water use and reducing
pollution were seen as priority issues.

1.27    BankStrategyfor Landand Water was formalizedin the mid-1980s.The
Bank's first agriculture sectorreview drew attentionto the problems of China's degraded
land and the needfor complementary approaches to land and water management. Inthat
sense it laid the foundation for the Bank's investmentsinthe Loess Plateau andthe Tarim
Basin.

1.28    The Bank's 1985 China - Long-term Issues and Options evaluated key issues facing
China and made recommendations for the Bank's future engagement over the period 1985-
2000. The overriding concern was to achieve China's ultimate economic objective o f
catching up with developed countries while ensuringthat the benefits o fprosperity are
widely sharedwithinthe socialist system. While agriculture would continue to be largest
andmost important sector of China's economy inthe short to medium-term,the report
clearly saw the general direction o f development as a shift away from activities that are
constrained by fixed resources (land and water) and a shift into improving human capital
for modern agriculture including agro-industrial production.

1.29    Evenso, investmentinirrigation and drainage was suggestedto increase production
and offset the highloss o f cultivable landconverted to non-farm uses. Drainage
improvement was seen as a priority activity inthe NorthChina. Expansiono f irrigated area
was seen as less importantthan improvedwater management inexisting irrigation systems,
a highproportiono f which lackedadequate facilities for distributionto the farm level. Such
an approach recognizedthat competition for available water insome parts o f China
between agriculture, industry and human consumptionwill increase and make agricultural
expansion more difficult.

 1.30   Based onthe results o f Chinese pilot studies the Bank recommended that the
productivity o fupto 20 mha o f loess soils mightbe substantially improved if
economically justified after further study. Major elements inthe improvement o f such lands
include the conversion o fthe most erosion-prone croplands to grass and trees, control o f
grazing particularly by sheep and goats, and the plantingo fbetter adapted crop varieties.

 1.31 Inthe poorest provinces agricultural development was seen as possibly the only
way to increase incomes where degraded land reduced production capacity and made
livestock productionunprofitable. Thus the Bank's recommendations targeted both likely
interventions and regions- but with reservations. The typically resource-poor areas o f
extremepoverty inthe northwest and southwest were apriority but it cautioned that
investment may not bejustified on economic grounds alone. Development constraints to
address were lack o f irrigation, salinization, depletedpasture and harsh climate inthe
northwest, poor soil and inadequate drainage inthe southwest and weak transport
infrastructure inboth regions. Inthe worst-off areas, the Bank identified out-migration as
potentially one o fthe only feasible policy measures.

 1.32   The Bankintroducedintegratedriver basinplanning.The Xiaolangdi
multipurpose dam project was the logical outcome o fthe Bank's first major piece o f
analytical and advisory work aiming specifically at water and sediment management: the
 1993 Yellow River Basin Investment Planning Study. The study, using a simulation model
and non-linear optimization techniques, determinedplanning priorities for the basin,
identifiedwhich o fthe government's proposed investmentstotaling US$10.8 billionwere

                                                9


economic, and proposed an economically viable development program coveringthe period
to 2010.

1.33    Unlikethe earlier planningexercise carried out byYellow RiverConservancy
Commission(YRCC) in 1988,26it brought all available data together ina consistent
framework and put economic, rather then engineeringviability as the decision variable.
The multivariate simulation model developed by the study team was subsequently
mainstreamed by YRCC. The results it produced challenged YRCC's ambitious plans to
increase irrigation inthe basinby 40 percent. It found that only halfo fthe proposed area o f
1.7 millionha was viable giventhe water requiredfor sediment flushing and meetinga
doubling o fmunicipal and industrial demand. And even the smaller expansion o f irrigation
would bejeopardized ifthere were no improvements to agricultural water use efficiency on
the existing irrigatedarea o f 2.9 millionha. The study also revealed that China's basic
water, landand agricultural planningdate was or poor quality, piecemeal and sometimes
inconsistent.

1.34    The Bank undertook a major environmental sector reviewin2000, Clear Water,
Blue Skies,and produced a Country Water Resources Assistance Strategy (CWRAS) and an
Agendafor Water Sector Strategyfor North China in2002. Together their findings and
strategies affirmed the continued relevance o fthe development objectives o fthe three
assessedprojects and the Bank's water and land development portfolio o fprojects.

1.35     While Clear Water,Blue Skies (2001) focused primarilyon air andwater pollution
andtheir relationto economic growth, itproduced recommendations for action onwater
that support the objectives o fthe river basinmanagement aspects o fthe projects. Notably,
the report highlightedthe mutually reinforcing nature o f higher levies and economic
reforms incontrolling pollution. Specifically, inthe short-term it recommended
strengthening river basinmanagement by consolidating government agencies and
allocating responsibilities to fewer institutions; providing technical and financial assistance
to disseminating water-saving technologies for agriculture and industries; andto protect
water resources from overexploitation, introductiono f regulation and a water extraction
tax. Inthe medium-termit recommended price adjustment to encourage water
conservation.

 1.36    TheAgendafor WaterSector Strategyfor North China andthe CWMS are less
sanguine. They found that the traditional water management practices will not support
continued sustainable growth inthe 21Stcentury. They predictedthat acute water shortage
and pollution inNorth China will soon become unmanageable unless more significant,
comprehensive and sustained commitments are made to implement strategies and
initiatives to bringwater resources utilization back into a sustainable balance. While supply
augmentation i s probably necessary, this cannot be achieved without pricing, management
andregulatory reforms inall areas o fwater resources management.

BankAssistance for LandandWater Management

1.37     Inresponseto China's needs theBank started lendingin1981andsincethentotal
lendingacross all sectors has exceededUS$39billion.             27 About a quarter o f   this was for
rural development and 17percent -US$6.65 billion-was to assist improved management
o f landand water.

1.38     Lendingfor agricultural water management started in 1982and a series o f23
projects has enabled the Bankto assist most regions o f China. The majority o fthis
assistancewas for province-specific area development projects that initially focused on
extending and completing irrigation infrastructure inexistingprojects. And since the early
1990sinstitutional development became increasingly important. Similarly, lending for land
management started in 1983 through a series o ften projects, each covering several
provinces ina region, focusing on areas needingbetter land andwatershed management to
alleviate poverty, conserve water and reduce erosion and flooding.

1.39     The three projects that are the subject o fthis assessmentspannedthe period from
1994 to the end o f 2005 and embodied important newinitiatives and more comprehensive
and multi-sectoralapproachesto landand water management. All three projects deal with
different aspectso friver basinmanagement incentral and western China. The Loess
PlateauProject addresses the issue o f sustainable land and watershed management inthe
Yellow RiverBasin. The other two projects support introduction o f integrated river basin
management to the Yellow River and Tarim RiverBasins. Each o f three projects hadtwo
phases. Inaddition, the Xiaolangdi Project includedinvoluntary resettlement o f over
184,000 people that was assessed at the same time andthis i s reported separately.28

1.40     Rationalefor the Loess PlateauProjects.Initially, the Bank provided its support
to mitigate the poverty impacts resultingfrom land degradation inthe relatively poor red
soils areas insoutheast China through its two Red Soils projects. The first RedSoils Project
was largely successful indemonstrating the state-of-the-art technology for watershed
management on especially favorable sites. Emboldened by the success o fthis approach in
1994 the Bank embarked on a second-phaseRed Soils Project (a typical Red Soils
watershed included the steeper sloping, shallower soil areas o fthe upper area, where the
role o f forestry would be more important, as well as the gentler sloping, terraced landmore
typical o fthe first RedSoil Project areas.) At the same time the government expanded the
watershed management portfolio to tackle a more challenging area-the Loess Plateauthat
covers 640,000 square kilometers o fthe upper and middle parts o fthe Yellow River
Basin.29This follows the recommendation o fthe 1993 Yellow RiverBasinInvestment

approach that encompasseda broader range o f site conditions andproven environmental
protectionmethods.

1.41    Rationale for the Xiaolangdi Multipurpose Project. The Bank's Yellow River
Basin Investment Planning Study demonstrated that only some ofthe major infrastructure
projects envisaged by YRCC were economically viable. By carefully examining the
seasonally variablevalue o fwater for agriculture and sediment control the study
determinedthat construction o fthe Xiaolangdi multipurpose dam andexpansionof
sediment control efforts inthe upstreamloess plateau was requiredandthat bothwould be
economic. The study also demonstratedthat water was pricedfar belowits opportunity cost
-agriculturalwaterpriceswereonehundredthofthemar inalvalue.Withinthebasinthe
price elasticity o f water was estimated to be close to -1.0." Thus the study recommended
that raising water fees should be a major part of the government's strategy to conserve
water and maximize economic returns.

1.42     Rationale for the Tarim Basin Project. Situated inthe border ofnorthwest China,
the Tarim Basinforms the southernhalfofXinjiang UygurAutonomous Region. With an
area o f slightly over half a million square kmand a populationi s about 7 millionthis closed
basini s surrounded by mountains onthree sides. Traditionally, agriculture on the piedmont
margins o fthe basincentered on oasesfedbythese rivers or from Kere~esThe~total                     . ~
populationinthe project areain 1998 was 4.7 millionpeople o f whom 3.6 million lived in
rural areas. The agricultural labor force was 0.94 million andthey manageda cultivated
area o f about 0.56 million ha. By completion the total project population hadincreased by
50,000 people and the agricultural labor force by 4,000.32

1.43      Annual precipitationranges from 1000 mmover the mountains to less than 20 mm
inthe center ofthe basin. The TarimRiver- China's longest inlandriver(1300 km)                            -
drains the basin eastwards around the Taklamakan Desert into Taitema Lake. Numerous
smaller rivers runoff the mountains but most disappear into the desert. Prior to the start of
reservoirs and irrigation works (1957) the Tarim's waters reachedLopNor (now a salt-
encrusted lake bed). Historical annual flows average over 5 billion cubic
Subsequent upstreamdiversionscausedthe riverto becomedry over the 300 kmreach
upstreamofTaitema Lake since 1972.34This 300 kmreach-referredto as the "green
corridor" -supported a forest ofpoplar and Chinese tamarisk and related flora that formed



highlands and large river valleys, it is covered with a layer of loess 100to 200 meters deep. According to
historical records, most o f the plateau was covered with dense forests, lushgrasslands and fertile soil. But
predatory reclamation, indiscriminate felling o ftrees and overuse o f grasslands as well as destruction by
frequent wars stripped the area o f nearly all its forests. Each year, more than a billion tons o f mud and silt are
swept from the plateau into the Yellow River, the cradle o f the Chinese civilization.
30. Price elasticities to demand: domestic water -0.3 to 0.6; industry -.045 to -1.37; irrigation -.037 to -1.5.
31. The traditional irrigation supply in the Tarim basin i s the Kerez system. Gently sloping tunnels collect
ground water from the piedmont areas and provide oasis irrigation via shallow wells or small reservoirs.
These tunnels were excavatedover 2,000 years ago and the total lengthis about 5,000 km.

a barrier to the northward expansion o fthe desert.35Inaddition biodiversity was
significantly reduced. Over-irrigated areas upstream became salinized and this produced
poorer quality inflows to the river downstream. Together they reduced agricultural
productivity and adversely affected farmers' and pastoralists' livelihoods. These problems
andthe gradual loss ofthe green corridor also focused nationaland internationalattention
onthe consequences o f environmental mismanagement. Thus recreation o f the lower Tarim
Riverto sustainthe green corridor became a nationalpolicy issue. Its recreation also
became a key outcome indicator o fthe integrated effects o f efforts to upgrade irrigation
engineering, agriculturalpractices and institutions inthe context o friver basin
management.

objectives and components were closely matched to China's development needs, Table 1.

SECOND LOESS PLATEAU WATERSHED
REHABILITATIONPROJECT

2.2     Second Loess Plateau Watershed Rehabilitation Project. Early efforts to treat
the Loess Plateau includednationally-driventop-downcampaigns to terrace slopes, plant
trees and shrubs, and builddams inthe gullies to intercept sediment runoff. While broadly
successful inreducing erosion these interventions were not integrated with efforts to raise
agriculturalproductivity and farm incomes. The major issue was the poor linkage between
land conservation and income-generating activities. Subsequentlythe Government's
development strategy for the Loess Plateau changed inresponseto successful pilots in
small watersheds (para 1.40) where it was demonstrated that a comprehensive approach
involving beneficiaries could tackle both soil erosion and raise farm incomes. This
approachwas implementedwith considerable success on over 700,000 ha o f land inthe
Bank's first Loess PlateauWatershed DevelopmentProject (1993-2000) that covered three
 province^.^^ The secondproject extended the geographic scope inthe original              three
provinces (Shanxi, Shaanxi and Inner Mongolia) and replicated it ina fourth: Gansu
province.

OBJECTIVES

2.3       The two objectives o fthe projectwere to helpachieve sustainable development in
the Loess Plateau by (a) increasing agriculturalproduction and incomes and (b) improving
ecological conditions inthe tributary watersheds o fthe Yellow River.These were to be
achieved through the introductiono f more efficient and sustainable use o f land and water
resources, and the reduction o f erosion in, and sediment flows from, 12tributaries o fthe
Yellow River over an area o f 19,500 square kilometers. O fthe 39 counties inthe project,
19 are officially classified as among the poorest inChina, and it was expected that the
project would directly benefit 2 millionpeople. Inaddition it was expected to produce
substantial benefits downstream as a result o f reduced sedimentation, and globally through
carbon sequestration. There were three main components: crop-land improvement,
slopelandprotection and support services and training. Details o f objectives, components
and costs are summarized inTable 2.

DESIGN

2.4      Withinthe Loess Plateau about 1,100 small watersheds were targetedas the basic
planning unit for improvement. A typical watershed contained several villages and ranged
insize from 1,000 to 3,000 ha. Crop-landwith slopes lessthan 25 degrees coveringabout
88,900 ha around 3,464 villages was to be improved through terracing, sediment control
structures and provision o f irrigation. The wide and level terraces created from slopelands
and old degradedterraces would enable improved agriculture and easiermanagement.
Sediment control structures were designed to control flooding, create usable landand store
water for irrigation andvillage water supply. Irrigation works includedthe construction o f
about 30,000 small water cisterns to catch run-off (mainly from roads), small surface-water
diversion structures, and small-sized irrigation schemes to serve 4,100 ha mostly inInner
Mongolia. Most o fthe land leveling and terracing work was to be undertakenthough
individual contracts with local operators o f small bulldozing equipment, communities and,
occasionally, with individual farmers. Arbor trees and shrubs were providedby specialist
forestry teams under contract to communities; orchards and grasseswere plantedby
individual farmers.

2.5      Slopeland protectionwas intendedto reduce erosion and water loss and allow
farmers to increase their income through diversification o f their production systems. This
included 90,000 ha o f afforestation and 91,000 ha o f shrubs on land too steep for trees.
Pasture grasses to support livestock development would cover 56,00Oha, and horticulture -
mainly h i t and nut-bearing trees -would cover another 72,000 ha. Most o fthis work was
to be done through contracts with community groups similar to that for terracing.

                                                 15


2.6     Training was to finance human capacity development through research and
extension, training and study tours, survey and design work and monitoring and evaluation
activities. Inadditionthe project financed vehicles, office upgrades and equipment, and
project operation and management costs.

2.7      To increase ownership o f the project's conservation focus, the project demanded
various kinds o f obligations such as significant restrictions on fanners' production practices
inreturnfor localinvestment(e.g., stopping free grazing or cropping on slopes.) For other
activities where fanners provided free labor, the project provided trees and shrubs free o f
costs but requiredsignature o f "use and management" contracts to ensure sustainability.
Project investmentinorchard trees onterraces, irrigation, grass and livestock, was to be on
the understanding that beneficiaries repaidthe principalplusan interest rate ofbetween4
and 6 percent. Inmost cases the counties provided loans to farmers for this purpose. The
cost o f inputsthat providedpublic goods, such as dams androads, was to be repaidby the
counties.

2.8      Quality at entry i s rated as satisfactory. Giventhe physical coverage o fthe project
(para 2.10) the decision not to loadthe components with newinstitutions or reform existing
ones was pragmatic, as was excluding support for secondary activities such as improving
extension services, rural credit, agro-processing or marketing.There was no independent
reviewbythe Bank's Quality Assurance Group.

IMPLEMENTATION

2.9      The central Ministry of Water Resources (MWR) hadoverall responsibility for the
project that was implementedthrough the Yellow River Basin Commission based in
Zhenzhou, Henanprovince and its Upper and Middle Reach Bureaubased inXian, Shaanxi
province. Policy and coordinationat the central, provincial, prefectural and county levels
was through Project Leading Groups (PLGs). The central PLGwas headedby a vice
ministerofthe MWR, and includes representatives from the Ministryo fForestry, one vice
governor from each o fthe project's provinces, several directors o f YRCC, MWRs'
ForeignAffairs, Planning, Water and soil Conservation, Water Resources, and Finance
bureaus and representatives from the our provincial Project Management Offices. The
PLG's at the provincial level have the same structure andwere headed by the vice governor
incharge ofagriculture assistedbythe localrepresentatives o fthe central ministriesand
the Agricultural Bank o f China. Prefectural and county level PLGs had similar structure
and responsibility. A central Project Management Office (PMO) was locatedinthe YRCC
offices and with the regional governments looked after day-to-day management o f all
aspects o fthe project, including international procurement and training. Provincial and
county PMOSmanaged implementationat those levels and worked through the village
level committees.

2.10     The scale o f the project was extremely challenging with as much as 1,000 km
betweenproject watershedsthat includeddetailed terracing andplanting o ftrees, shrubs
and grasses over an area o f400,000 ha. The overall management structure hadunits in264
xiangs (township), 37 counties and 12prefectures inShaanxi, Shanxi, Gansuand Inner
Mongolia. Work was implementedin3,350 administrative villages.

2.11 The project became effective in September 1999but got off to a slow start because
it overlapped the last three years o fthe first Loess PlateauProject and several newnational
policy initiatives and programs for reclaiming degraded lands became operational (para
2.13). Together these increasing demands stretched local resources. Thus insufficient
counterpart fundingwas a major problem at all levels throughout implementation and
carried reputational risks for the project's environmental focus due to delayed payment o f
suppliers, contractors andfarmers. This shortage was accentuated by unfamiliarity with
Bank reimbursementprocedures at the township and county levels, overloaded
accountants, significant processing delays withinprovincial Finance Bureaus and
unwillingness (drivenby prefectural and county poverty considerations) to recover costs
from beneficiary farmers. Several PMOSdiverted or withheldBank funds disbursedfor
physical works to cover operating andmanagement costs, raising objections from auditors.
Despiteall these problems, physicalprogress was extremelywell managed and met most
output targets.

2.12     Disseminationo fthe project concept and obtaining local buy-inwas made more
onerous by exogenous factors. Severe droughts inlate 1999,2000 and 2001 made
establishment o ftrees and shrubs difficult and requiredmuch replanting leading to higher
         Over the same period, sharply lower global prices for agricultural commodities
reduced farmer's profits from planting grains on the newly constructed terraces lowering
interest inthe project - short-term gains from annual crops were an essential stop-gap
while farmers waited for the harvest from trees and orchards to mature. Inadditionthe
dissemination and adoption o f grazing bans on steeply sloping lands cut income from sheep
and goats. To compensate, targets for terrace construction were slightly reduced andmore
project funding was allocated to livestock at mid-ternreview. This, inturn, put a greater
emphasis on forage crops and creation o f grasslands, and ledto increased tree plantingin
gullies instead of less-profitable shrubs.

2.13     A numbero fnewnationalprojects andprograms influencedproject
implementation. While almost all reinforcedthe conservation objectives o fthe project,
their top-down approach and liberal use ofgrants underminedLoess 11's participatory and
self-reliance approach that did not include subsidies (para 2.7.) The major programs
includedthe `Returning Slopeland to Forest', the `ReturningSlopeland to Grassland', the
`Ecological Reconstruction' and the `Sandstorm Prevention' programs. While supporting
activities similar to those inLoess 11, most o fthese interventions focused primarily on
resource conservation with little concern for local livelihoods. Evenso, their similarityto
Loess I1activities created misunderstanding at the local level and confused project
beneficiaries. The new national programs also provided grant funds for activities that Loess
I1expected localbeneficiaries to pay for inkindor cash (tree and grass planting on slopes,
water cisterns, and small-scale irrigation). 38

2.14    Repayment obligations ofthe Bank-financed investment transferred to farmers were
handled by the counties who tried with varying success to balance cost-recovery
obligations between private beneficiaries and the public sector. This was strongly
influenced bythe political climate that increasingly aimed to lower the burden on farmers
by increasing grant-aided programs and eventually abolishing most fees, levies and
agricultural taxes. Often the counties were left with unforeseen obligations that further
exacerbated their cash-flow and slowed progress. For example, because key dams and
warping dams39generated significant downstream benefits, YRCC,provincial and county
officials argued that the cost should be borne by central government, not by them. In
consequence, at mid-term review, only 15 percent of physical targets for these dams had
been achieved. Subsequently, after failure to obtain a central government policy directive,
each structure was paid for according to local agreements. Inmost cases the counties ended
uppaying for those that were built.

2.15    Adequate and timely supply of highquality tree and shrub seedlings, a vital
component of the project, was hindered by continued public ownership of project-financed
nurseries that were seen as "cash-cows" by the Forestry Departments and county officials.
A s the mid-term review noted: "The less than satisfactory nursery outputs are causedby
inadequatesupervision of project nurseries and their outmoded managementandplanting
practices. Manyprocedures are conservativeand out of date...Theirplanting regimes are
haphazardand in most cases they are rarely integrated with the actual needs of the
treatment areas. Managers are often administrators with nofundamental understanding or
knowledge of technical issues and most of them have only received minimal training in
nursery management.Downstream trainingfor the out-reachfarmer nurseries is also
haphazard and, in many cases, non-existent.''And to make matters worse, the lack of
independent oversight created a conflict-of-interest for state nurseries thus ensuring that all
seedlings regardless of quality were transplanted. As a result, they were less able to survive
the drought years and about a thirdrequired replanting. This marginally improved towards
the end of the project when the entrepreneurial skills of the private sector were unleashed
bythe agricultural reforms of 2002 and some private nurseries were established. Farmers
andofficials interviewedby IEGfour years later confirmed that the supply ofhighquality
seedlings remains a problem for many o f the same reasons.40

2.16    Project closing was extended for 6 months to mitigate crop failure caused by
drought and the loss of a construction season incurredby an outbreak of SARS. Reduced
interest payments duringconstruction led to project cost savings of US$12.2 million. The

Monitoring and Evaluation

2.17     Design. Robust monitoring indicators were developed at appraisal and fully
implementedusing existingM&Esystems developed underthe first Loess PlateauProject.
Progress, input, output and outcome indicators were clearly specified as were targets and
milestones. Quality o f designi s rated as high.

2.18     At appraisal itwas statedthat "the project will be monitoredthrough a set of
indicators that take into account the four key elements o f a sustainable development
strategy: productivity, stability, resilience and equity. Specifically, project staff will
monitor impacts on crop yields, household production and incomes, grazing policies and
practices, long-term land use rights, and integrated watershed planning." The Project
Appraisal Document (PAD) gives a very clear statement o f desired project outcome and
outputs and how these performance indicators were to be measured. The primary
instrumentswould be surveys ofhousehold incomes, productionwithand without the
project and sedimentmonitoring inone watershed per county. The designo fthe detailed
relationship betweenproject components, their linkages, the economic benefits generated
and how these were to be monitored and quantifiedfor economic appraisal andevaluation
i s rated by this assessmentas best practice.41

2.19     Implementation. Outcome and impact monitoring forphysical accomplishments
benefitedfrom training and was satisfactory. But reporting o f incomes and economic
benefitsis not reliable for several reasons. First, the methodology usedto establish
"without project" control areas i s unclear (except inthat they were not random) as it was
subordinated to eachprovince and subsequentlydownto county level. Second, the methods
usedto select individualhouseholds were subjective andnot random, and dependedalmost
entirelyonthe understanding and knowledge o fthe local official monitors. Third, no
attempt was made to account for spillover effects from parallel projects on either project
samples or their controls. Fourth, there were no strict guidelines to assist baseline
household selection or ensure a standard process and conformity inreporting. Fifth, the
interpretation o f indicators showed wide variation as didhow the indicators should be
calculated. Random checks by the Bank's monitoring specialists in2000 revealed a whole
range o fproblems.42However, this was their final inputto the project and it i s not known if
theirconcerns were addressed.

include any poor families. Counties should delete these unrepresentative households from the sample and
instead make sure that households typical o f each grouping are chosen. For some counties, this may mean the
entire sample should be reevaluated and perhaps redrawn. Onthe Northern route, the mission checked the
accuracy o f the household monitoring data in almost all counties. Regrettably, major differences were often
apparent betweenthe monitoring data collected and the actual situation inthe households. Common errors
included: i)recording data at mid-year and therefore not capturing the entire year's results; ii)including land
invested under the project inthe baseline data; iii)omitting large pieces o f land; iv) inaccurately counting
household members. Inconsistent treatment o f some line items between counties was also quite common."

2.20    Utilization. Effective M&Esystems developed underthe project for management
o f inputsand outputs were fully internalizedandhave been widely adopted inother
national programs. The institutionaldevelopment impact inducedby good M&Epractices
for monitoring project progress and costs was substantial according to prefecture and local
government officials interviewedby IEG.Local documentation o fproject processes is
impressive.Transparent andeffective accountability allowed evaluation o fthe
effectiveness o fpublic sector institutions, project management and individuals, and
improved local implementationcapacity. Local ownership is highand political leaders at
various levels have taken personal responsibility for the project, exercising a tight system
o f control and self-evaluation. As far as IEGcould determine routine process-related M&E
at the county and prefectural level continues. It i s not certain, however, ifthe results are
used.

2.21    O fmore concern i s that the "impacts" o fthe project on incomes and economic
efficiency may be misleading because o fthe questionable methodology and
implementation. Giventhe widely geographic dispersion o fthe project sites a strong case
couldbe made for a more experimental approach with a much greater degree o f
management by M&E specialists.

2.22    Becauseo fthe questions raised by the implementationand utilization experience o f
M&E, its overall quality is ratedmodest. This rating gives greater weight to satisfactory
assessment o fthe achievement ofthe income improvement objective.

Safeguard Compliance

2.23    The project raised only one safeguard issue concerning small dams. While it was
not raised at appraisal it was reviewedduringthe Bank's regular supervision and found to
be o fno concern.

Relevance

2.24    Relevanceis rated as high. The project was relevantto the CAS objectives and for
the agriculture sector inChina. These called for assistanceto promote better utilization o f
marginal landthrough sustainable techniques, and to develop new income-generation
programs inpoorer provinces. Environment objectives o fthe CAS include promotion o f
soil and water conservation that are the major components o fthis project.

2.25    China's NinthFive-Year Plan(1995-2000) placedsustained and stable growth in
agriculture andthe rural economy at the top o f its agenda, and its ambitious goals include
major increasesingrainproductionand farmers incomes particularly inthe arid and semi-
arid zones that account for 30 percent o fthe total arable land. Following the drought and
flood events o fthe late 1 9 9 0 the
                                 ~ ~ central government initiated six large-scale forest
conservation programs to restore forest and vegetative cover inupstream watersheds o fthe
Yellow and Yangtze River basins. Two o fthese programs, the 1999 Sloping Land
Conversion Program (SLCP) - also knownas the Grain for GreenProgram-andthe 1999

EcologicalForest Compensation Program begantrial implementation inearly 2000 with an
overall budgeto fmore than US$40 billion.43

2.26     Inthe Loess Plateaugovernment strategy emphasizesthe comprehensive and
integrated planningo f small individual watersheds inclose consultation with the
beneficiaries because land conservation i s compatible with sustainable and productive
agriculture andthey are mutually reinforcing. This approach was piloted on over 700,000
ha o f land inthe highly successful first Loess Plateau Watershed RehabilitationProject that
overlapped this project and was completed in2002. The devastating floods on the River
Yangtze in2002 also heightenedthe Government's concernto address the causes o f the
flooding, deforestation and erosion causedby decades o f unsustainable land-use practices.
Consequently the project enabled the promotion o f integrated watershed development on a
large scale inChina.

2.27     Project design was and remains relevant becausepartnership betweenthe public
sector, local governmental institutions and farmers i s essential for sustainable development
o fwatersheds. The Bank's most recent global critique o f watershed management reaches
the same concl~sion.~~comprehensive approach adopted correctly promoted integrated
                           The
watershed management that includedforestry, soil and water conservation, agriculture, and
livestock sectors. Its reliance on the public sector for implementationwas relevant because
at the time o f designthe private sector was unwilling to provide financing for these types o f
investments,particularly inthe poorer areas targetedbythe project. At evaluation,
extensivepublic sector involvement make remains relevant becauseo fthe strong public
good element o fthe objectives and the few private rural and agricultural enterprises able to
participate onventures o fthis scale.

2.32    Some 80,832 ha o fterraces
(91 percent o fthe appraisal target)
were constructed andprovide the
basis for annual and perennial
crops produced on terraces,
including food grains, vegetables,
fodder crops (e.g., maize and
legumes) and fruit trees.
Conversion o f slopeland to leveled
fields increasedmoisture
retention, reduced soil erosion and
ledto higher crop yields (50-100                500 -
percent higherthan on the
previously sloped land) and more
diversifiedcropping. Along with
the terracing ofslopeland, some
24,000 water cisterns were              Source: Loess Platueau I1M&E database
constructed (79 percent o f the appraisal target) and are successfully mitigating adverse
effects o f frequentperiods o f drought. Most investmentsinirrigation were made inInner
Mongolia where the extremely low rainfall means that terracing alone would not
sufficiently raise yields to bring about a sustainable agricultural system.

2.33    Farmers established about 57,000 ha o f forage that not only reduced soil erosion o f
sloping lands but also provided fodder for pen-fedanimals thus reducing grazing pressure.
All project counties have now adopted and enforce grazing bans, andthe provincial
authorities have extendedthis practice to most other counties inthe four project provinces
-this now covers about 85,300 ha. After the widespread adoption ofgrazing bans, the
growing o f forage was successfully practiced on a large scale inmost project areas. Along
withthe grazing ban, the project successfully provided investmentinlivestock production
to help farmers to cope with the effects o fthe ban, support the transition into sustainable
production systems and make full use o f incremental fodder andcrop residues produced by
other activities to support over 38,000 head o f incremental stock. The introductiono f new
breeds o f sheep and goats suitable for pen-feeding, such as Cashmere and Boer goats and
Shandong small-tailed sheep, rapidly replaced local breedsand their improvedproductivity
made livestock production a major contributor to household incomes, particularly inthe
drier northerncounties.

2.34    About 63,000 ha o f "economic trees" and orchards were plantedunder the project
(87 percent o fthe appraisal target o f 72,000 ha). Continuously improving road network and
information access has enabled these plantations to generate attractive financial returns on
domestic and export market. Over 1,100 fruit stores were built (103 percent o fthe target)
andallow farmers to capture additional benefitsfrom selling off-season.

Ecological conditionsin the tributary watersheds of the YellowRiver improved

2.35    This project established 109,000 ha offorest trees (121 percent ofthe appraisal
target) incontour trenches or inpits on wastelands. Inareas less suitable for trees, some
71,000 ha (78 percent o fthe appraisal target) o f drought-tolerant shrubs have beenplanted.

Some 57,000 ha o f slopeland were closed and protected for the purpose o f natural regrowth
o fvegetation. An ecological survey o f one catchment where grazing was banned indicates
a modest increase inbiodiversity: from 107 to 112 varieties o fplants and from 36 to 38
families.47 The same evaluation report estimated that the total area o f newvegetation
produced by the project can absorb 1.48 milliontons o f carbon dioxide each year.

2.36    The 2,100 small sediment control structures built are estimated to divert or capture
about 25 milliontons o f sedimentper year, o fwhich some 45 percent i s retained by the
dams and the remainder i s retained by the terraces and the various vegetative measures. To
date project works retained an estimated total o f 53 milliontons o f sediment.

Efficiency

2.37    Project efficiency i s rated as substantial but with some shortcomings.

2.38    Overall ERRSvaried from 18 percent to 21 percent, close to the appraisal estimate
o f20.9 percent. The slightly highervalues include the benefits from sediment reduction
and carbon sequestration. Although the methodology usedto calculate the ERRis
exemplary,this assessmentbelieves that production costs are underestimated andbenefits
are overestimated due to the presence o f other donor and a substantial number o f Chinese-
financed local developments that fostered increasedproductivity and incomes. Inaddition
manyruralroads were constructed by other agencies andthis not only changed market
opportunities but also providedoff-farm employment access, andbetter education and
health.

OUTCOME

2.39    The outcome of the project is rated as satisfactory. Relevance was high, while
efficacy and efficiency are rated as substantial. Table 3 summarizes the results by
objectives discussedinpreviously.

2.40    IEG's field visits and interviews confirmedthat substantial economic development
had occurred at sites visited. However, it was also clear that there had beenmany inputs in
these areas that complemented those o f the project. Because o f the difficulties with the
implementationo fthe M&E system a robust counterfactual could not be determined.In
consequenceattribution o f observed benefits i s difficult and, at best, IEGcan only confirm
that the efficacy and efficiency o fthe project are substantial and this leads to a rating o f
outcome as satisfactory. Ifa robust counterfactual had been available and had been
monitored correctly, the ICR's highly satisfactory outcome rating may have been
confirmed.

RISKTODEVELOPMENT            OUTCOMES

2.41     Riskto developmentoutcome is ratedas moderate. The mainrisk factors are
institutional and environmental.

2.42     Institutionalriskarises from continued local government willingnessto enforce
the grazing banand assistwith future operation andmaintenance o fterraces should they be
damaged by extreme weather events. There i s a risk that farmers will not remainwilling to
forgo income for 4-10 years while their economic trees mature and bear fruit, or remain
willing to repay their share o fproject investmentand look after the reclaimed slopes that
have sub-marginal returns when opportunities for off-farm employment look increasingly
favorable. This risk i s enhancedbecause non-project land conservation activities inthe
Loess Plateau area are fully subsidized though centrally-funded programs.

2.43      The SLCP has stated environmental goals o freducingwater and soil erosion and
increasing China's forest cover and areaby retiringsteeply sloping and marginal lands
from agriculturalproduction. Farmersare compensated with grain and cash subsidies for
taking sloping land out o f agriculturalproduction, and providedwith seedlingand
management subsidies for planting and cultivating trees and grassland on converted land.
The program was designedto convert 14.67 millionhectares o f cropland (including a target
o f afforesting 4.4 millionha o f landwith gradients o fmore than25 degrees) in23
provinces to forest by 2010 and has an overall budget o fmore than US$40 billion. In
addition, it hada soft goal o f afforesting an equivalent area o f~asteland.~'

Yellow rivers. Inthe first four years 15 millionfarmers enteredthe program. It expanded to
2,000 counties in25 provinces and by 2004 had converted 7.2 millionha o f croplandand
afforested 4.9 millionha o fwasteland.

2.45    There is a modest risk also that government's current focus on conservation and
"grain-for-green" philosophy may beje~pardized.~~Earlier government policies towards
restoring degraded land were a responseto the growing stockpiles o f grain inthe late
1990s. However, now that water shortagesare reducing grain output inthe norththere i s a
riskthat food production concerns may override those for conservation andthusjeopardize
the "grain-for-green" philosophy. Ifso, central fundingcould dry up and farmers could
abandon marginal land that i s not cost-effective to nurture.

2.46    Environmental risk. Large expanses o ftrees and brushunder drought conditions
pose a highfire risk. As far as IEGcould determine this has not beena concern o f local
government even though the Bank has raised this withcentral government.

2.47     The increasing water shortages inthe lower Yellow Riverbasinposes a riskthat
there will be sustained objection from lower ripariansto increasing water retention and use
inthe LoessPlateauareaas aresultofgreatly increaseddeep-rooted vegetation andcheck
structures and small dams to retainrunoff. Current water retention due to the project i s
relatively small it i s estimated to be 130millioncubic meters a year) so this risk i s
probably small;      This implicit transfer o fproperty rights (to water) implicit inthe greening
o fthe Loess Plateau i s not acknowledged by the Chinese government or taken into account
inthe inter-provincial water allocationprocedures (paras 2.107-2.1 13.)

BANKPERFORMANCE

2.48    Overall Bank performance is rated as satisfactory. The project preparation
processwas short because it built on the knowledge, experience and lessons o fthe first
Loess Plateau Project andhadthe same task team leader. The institutional, safeguard and
fiduciary aspectswere well understood as was the needto have improved arrangements for
monitoring and evaluation. Inretrospect, the familiarity withthe Chinese institutions
involved inthe first project may have causedunderestimation o fthe difficulties
encountered innewcounties and prefectures. Feedback for the Borrower put a very high
emphasis on the Bank's comprehensive approach that successfully marriedconservation
practice with income-generating opportunities for farmers. Similarly, the consistent
application o frigorous procurement and fiduciary policies, while at first beingseen as
onerous, was later fully accepted and mainstreamed inthe more progressive provinces.

2.49    Bank supervision i s rated as satisfactory but with some shortcomings. Supervision
o f such a large and diverse project area was hugelychallenging and the Bank team used
innovative methods to maximize field presenceand coverage -but only supervised once a
year. Problems were jointly identified, and solutions were discussed and agreed between
the Bank andthe Borrower andquickly implemented.Continuity oftask management and

maintaining a core supervision team composed o f a broad mix o f international and local
professionals throughout the project's life greatly helpedto develop and maintaina healthy
and trustful cooperation betweenthe Bank and the Borrower. This continuity and trust
allowed true sharing o f supervision responsibility andproblem solving ina consistent and
persistent way. However, the single annual missionwas inadequate giventhe reported
problems with counterpart funding and audits at the local level, and the concerns raised
about the understanding and implementationo fthe M&Eprogram. There should have been
more specialized follow-up on M&E, as acknowledged inthe ICR. This has now been
addressedinpartnershipwiththe UnitedKingdom's Department for International
Development (DFID) to helpupgrade M&Eand impact assessmentthrough parallel
financing.

BORROWER      PERFORMANCE

2.50    OverallBorrower performance is rated as highly satisfactory.Borrower
ownership was high. Preparationwas highly satisfactory. The MWRiYellow River
Conservancy Commissionput inplace a strong national preparation team that was formed
o f experienced project staff and external experts on agriculture, water resources
management, forestry, and institutional and social development andthis enabled the project
to be completed within a year. The project preparation work, adopting a fully participatory
approach, covered major technical, institutional, economic and environmental aspects of
the project design, and the views o f all stakeholders at central, provincial and local level
were reflectedinthe process.

2.5 1   Implementationwas highly satisfactory. The CentralPLGwas effective at
coordinating the project and ensuringa standardized approach to planning and management
among the participating provinces. They were proactive insupporting new initiatives
learnedfrom project feedback and demonstrated strong leadership backed up by significant
policy and operational support. The extensive promotion and enforcement o f grazing bans
and long-term land-use contracts have significantly contributed to the achievement o f
project objectives. The only real problem was the difficulty o f getting a continuous flow o f
adequate counterpart funding, particularly from the lowest administrative levels who hadto
pay for the project. It i s remarkable testament to the good Chinese project management
skills that, giventhis problem, the work was completed on schedule and there were no
slippages.

SUMMARY OF ISSUES LOESS RAISEDBY THE           PLATEAU PROJECT

2.52    The project experience raises four issues:
        The importance of a soundly designedM&E systemis particularly important given
        the number o f other development initiatives andprojects that affect the project area;
        More attention should be givento buildingcapacity for M&E at all levels that
        moves beyondthe simple measurement o fphysical impacts and include socio-
        economic impacts, development o frealistic counterfactuals and methods to deal
        with the problem ofattribution o fcosts andbenefits.
    0   Resolving the differing policies applied to financing and management o fwatershed
        conservation. The government's own watershed conservation projects remainpublic
        goods oriented and farmer's contributions are fully subsidized. This suggests that

                                                     27


         the Bank's innovations (through several Bank-financedwatershed conservation
         projects) inwhich beneficiaries are expectedto contribute to private goods
         generated by watershed conservation project remain enclave activities andthat the
         policies the Bank is promoting have not beenmainstreamed inChina.

XIAOLANGDI MULTIPURPOSEPROJECTSI& I1

OBJECTIVES

2.53     Eachproject hadthe same objectives. There were five aimed at:

     0   providing flood protection for major infrastructure and 103 million people mainly in
         the rural areas o f the North China Plain;
     0   controlling sediment accretion inthe 800 km lower reach o fthe Yellow River for a
         period o f about 20 years;
     0   supplyingand stabilizing water to several large andmediumcities andmajor
         industrial centers;
     0   providingreliable irrigation for some 2 million ha; and
     0   generating much neededhydropower to meet the peak power requirementsinthe
         Henan Grid.

2.54     Although the above objectives remained unchanged betweenPhase Iand I1o fthe
project, urbanwater supply took on an increasing importance at the project progressed.
Booming economic growth has translated into ever rising demand for municipal and
industrial water supplies, and this trendi s likely to continue. The Xiaolangdi reservoir i s
keyto maintaining urbanwater suppliesinnorth China duringperiods o f drought, as
eloquently illustratedin2000-01. This key role was not anticipated at the time of project
designand appraisal.

2.55     Overall project costs andphasing are summarized inTable 4. Costs classified as
"other" were export credits from the American Import and Export Bank (US$55.8 million)
and from the Tokyo MitsubishiBank (US$18.2 milli~n.)~'               Total costs are related to

DESIGN

2.56     The physical works consisted o fthe construction o fa very large dam and power
plant onthe Yellow Riverinthe transition zone betweenthe middle and lower reaches,
about 8OOkm upstream from the delta. The dam was designedspecifically to create a
reservoir capable o f storing bothwater as well as 0.5 billioncubic meters o f sedimentthat
was expected to accumulate init over 20 years.        52 This would not interfere withwater
storage, for which there would be 5.1 billion cubic meters o f capacity available.

2.57     Manytechnical and engineering studieswere done inthe decade-long period
preceding construction, (including some by international experts). Geological
investigations o fthe site go back as far as 1958. The Bank also provided some assistance in
project preparation, via the use o fthe IDA Second TA Credit. This evaluation shares the
view o fthe Bank's Quality Assurance Group that the project's quality at entry was highly
satisfactory. The early completion o fthe project i s an eloquent testimony to the
thoroughness and highquality o f all the preparatory work undertakenprior to construction.

Hydropower Development Corporation's (the Corporation) both locally and abroad and
providedtechnical assistanceto the MWR as well. The focus o fthe second Bank loanwas
on transformingthe Corporation into an operating rather than construction management
entity, while also providing considerable institutional support to the Commission inwater
allocation and dispatch, reservoir operations and flood and sedimentforecasting and
management information systems. The current irrigation water dispatch system for the
lower reach was set upwith Bank assistance under the project

2.59    The emphasis on developing facility management and training for the staff o fthe
neworganization set upto buildand operate the dam was appropriate. Training for the
Yellow River Conservancy Commission (the Commission) was to enable them to
undertake institutional reforms such as inthe areas o fwater pricing and facilitate
coordinationand interactive management systems with the Corporationon the day-to-day
regulationo fwater resourcesinthe river basinand flood forecasting.

IMPLEMENTATION

2.60    By any international civil engineeringstandards, the Xiaolangdi project is amajor
accomplishment interms o f its scale and complexity. The technical challenges and
difficulties inimplementationwere numerous, but as these have beendescribed
satisfactorily inthe ICRs, they will not be repeated here. Nevertheless, the fact that the
physical works were completed slightly below cost and a year ahead o f schedule should be
noted, as these are exceptional occurrences inthe case o fhydroelectric projects, regardless
o f where they are built. The first power generation unit went into service inlate 1999.
Downstream sediment flushing from the river bedhas beencarried out successfully since
2001 and continuous water flows to the river mouth have beenmaintained since then.

Monitoring and Evaluation

2.61    Design. The designo fM&EinPhase Iwas appropriate even though it paid little
attention to outcome indicators. This was because the focus was on the engineering
construction that was managed by the Corporation whilst the downstream impacts were
routinely monitored by either the Commission or the statistical departments o f Shandong
andHenanprovinces. Thus PhaseIfocused onphysical process indicators andreporting o f
physical progress and financial expendituresduring construction. However, it did
incorporate extensive arrangements for dam safety monitoring and flood forecasting inline
with international best practice. Thiswas independentlyoverseen by anindependentDam
Safety Panelthat included leading Chinese and World experts.

2.62    The PhaseI1designo fM&Ewas a markedimprovement and clearly specified key
performance, outcome indicators and targets. These were:

                                               31


        Eliminate annualflood damages ofUS$91millionayear
        Increase farm incomesby about 15 percentinHenanand increase labor productivity inthe
        farms by 20 percent.Increase grainyields by 20 percentfrom 4 tonsha to 4.8 tonsha and
        increase productionby 0.515 milliontons ayear.
        Reduce industrial downtime due to lack ofwater to 2 days per year
        Between200 and 2025 riverbedceases to rise between2001 and2025 andYellow River
        flood dykes do not haveto be raised.
        Eliminate catastrophicflood damage andreduce flood damagewithin the dykes for a 2-year
        occurrence to a 7-year occurrence.
        Generate 2,400 GWh ofpeak power 2001-03 increasingthis to 4,700 -5,400 GWhfrom
        2004.

         Apart from the monitoringo fpower generation, all the other indicatorswere
expectedto be part o f routine monitoring carried out by the Commission andprovincial
agencies. This was true o fthe indicators related to water levels, sediment and river
morphology butno arrangements were establishedto determine ifthe routine monitoring
by other agencies was satisfactory or coveredthe expectedoutcomes and impacts.
Although the expected outcomes were the result o fthe river basinmodeling exercise (para
1.33), this was a deterministic mathematical model andrepresentedonly a simplifiedform
o f economic reality. No allowances were made for the many other factors - including
changesto economic policy or the political economy -that would affect impacts on
agriculturalincomes and productionor security and availability o f downstream water
supplies.For example, industrial downtime due to lack o fwater was also a function o f
many exogenous factors such as intra-basin or municipalwater allocation withinthe
provinces, the water conveyance system below the dam and increasing industrial water
demand. Inthat sense there was no credible real time counterfactual against which to
measureincremental economic impact.

2.64    While the improvements inflood conditions and sedimentation could be measured
downstream, this would be the result o fthe cumulative impact o fXiaolangdi and changes
upstream. As far as this evaluation can determine, no mechanism was designedto monitor
the differential impacts ofthe dam and its operation. Overall quality o fM&Edesigni s thus
rated as modest.

2.65    Implementation.Dataon water inflows and outflows from the reservoirwere
collected and this continues. This i s a sine qua non for decisions on reservoir management,
water allocations and dispatch. Indicators o fpower operations are also recorded
continuously. The Commission has an extensive network o fhydrological stations on the
Yellow River andhas accumulated data over many years on water flows. These data
provide the essential inputs for its analytical work. Datarelating specifically to Xiaolangdi
are therefore just one necessary element inthe Commission's requirements for carrying out
its mandate o fwater resource management inthe Yellow River Basin.

2.66    The Commissionmonitors changes inthe deptho f the main channel o fthe river in
the lower reachinorder to assess the effectiveness ofthe sedimentflushing operations.
However, this evaluation was unable to ascertain ifthe Commissionmonitors ecological
changes inthe river or delta resultingfrom the restoration o f uninterruptedyear-round
water flows.

                                                    32


2.67    Utilization. Monitoring data have beenfully internalized andhave beenusedto
operatethe dam effectively according to its operating rules and the requirementsfor
sediment flushing, flood control and power generation. The efficacy and efficiency o fdam
operations i s discussedbelow (para 2.76 et seq).

2.68    Taking account of design, implementation and utilization, the overall quality of
M&Eis rated as modest. The reasonisthat the claims for the project's outcomes and
impacts on agriculturalproductionare basedupon modeled projections, not the results o f
field-level M&E. This i s not to say it could not be done. Giventhe large capital investment
less than 0.1 percent o fproject costs would have allowed a carefully designed and
independentlymanagedimpact evaluation usingan experimental (randomized) design.53

Safeguard compliance

2.69    The project raised three safeguard issues: dam safety, involuntary resettlement and
cultural heritage. The dam lies inan earthquake-prone area and could be subject to an
earthquake o f magnitude 6.25 on the Richter Scale. Project design fully internalizedthis
risk inthe designofthe dam andits embankments. A network of seismometers hasbeen
operational since 1995. A Dam Safety Panel has independent oversight o fthe facility.
Satisfactory arrangements are inplace for dam inspections andemergency preparedness.
The project was less successful inimposing dam safety requirementson the Sanmenxia
dam that lies upstream (theflood wave from the collapse or overtopping o f this dam would
threaten the safety of Xiaolangdi.) At completionthis dam hadproblems with inadequate
liftingcapacity ofthe gantry cranes at the dam crest andthis would significantly reduce its
ability to control pool levels ina flood emergency. Additionally there i s some risk that the
dam would be unable to maintain pool levels above 335 m.

2.70    Resettlemento f 184,040 people was subject to a stand-alone resettlement project
that metthe requirementso fthe Bank's policies on involuntary resettlement (OP4.12.)
EG's recent evaluation o fthis rated it as satisfactory butwithreservations on the cessation
o f M&Eactivities on credit closure. Without continued M&E it i s impossible to monitor
the longer term impacts ofenforcedresettlementonthe welfare and incomes ofaffected
people and host communities. Lack o fknowledge precludes establishment o f measuresto
mitigate hardship and accelerate a return to normality.

2.71     Cultural heritage was an issue becausethe dam was built in"the cradle o f Chinese
civilization." Extensive archeological investigations, classificationand salvage programs
were implementedand completed satisfactorily.

Relevance

2.72     Relevance is rated as high. This i s basedon strategic relevance to China's needs,
to the Bank's strategy for China (para 1.21 et seq.,) and relevance o fthe project design.




53. Such an exercise was extremely rare within the Bank at the time o f appraisal and it is only applied to a
small proportion o f social sector projects today.

                                                 33


2.73     The choice o f a multipurpose dam was highly relevant as it allowed flexibility o f
choice betweenvarious operational modes using an increasingly scarce resource -water.
The choice o fhydropower was appropriate giventhe needfor alternative sources o f clean
energy.

2.74     Flood and sedimentcontrol are closely linkedand clearly deserve top priority due to
the risk o fdestruction o f assets and loss o flife andthe heavy cost that this would impose
on China. Meetingthe water requirements o f urbanpopulations i s rightly considered the
nexthighestpriority. Water requirementsfor irrigation andpower are not necessarily
exclusive, but water releases from the Xiaolangdi reservoir would differ intime and scale if
power generation was to be givenpriority over irrigation. The priority givento agriculture
i s entirelyjustified giventhe large number o frural beneficiaries from irrigation andthe fact
that substitutesfrom other sources can be found for electricity supply.

2.75     The adoption o f a two-phase approach primarily to reduce engineeringrisks and
enable lessons from the first phase to be incorporated into the second phase was highly
relevant.

Efficacy

Flood protectionwas provided
2.76     Preventing damage to life and property i s the priority objective o fthe Xiaolangdi
project. The Xiaolangdi dam andreservoir together now provide the populationliving
downstream with protection against all floods with a one inthousand year probability.
Prior to the project, the existing infrastructure o f dams and dykes only offered protection
against floods with a one insixty year probability. By means o f careful water flow
regulation, Xiaolangdi has also successfully preventedthe formation o f `ice dams' that
usedto cause flooding inwinter when downstream sections o fthe river froze.

2.77     The efficacy o fthe dam was tested in2003, the heaviest wet seasoninNorthern
China since 1981. The reservoir was able to contain the inflows and store 6.3 billion cubic
meters o f water and maximum downstream discharge was limitedto 2,800 cubic meters per
second. Without it, flows downstream at Huayankouwould have reached 6,000 cubic
meters per second with devastating consequences and danger to 18 millionpeople. The
Corporationcites a figure o f Y 11billion (US$ 1.3 million) as the avoided cost o f flood
damage that would otherwise have occurred. IEGcould not find out what this figure
includes or how it was calculated.

2.78     On the basis o f experience to date this objective was fully achieved andits efficacy
i s rated "high."

Sediment accretion of the Yellow Riverwas controlled

2.79     Insome respects,the operational phaseo fthe Xiaolangdi project hasprovedto be
more complex than the actual construction o fthe project. The project designand
hydrological studies were done inthe 1980s (ifnot earlier) and nearly twenty years later,
the actual hydrology inthe immediate post-completionperiodhasturnedout to bequite

                                                         34


differentto what was expected.54The effect o f a series o fthree dry years (2000-02)
immediately coinciding with the completion o fthe dam ledto different reservoir operating
rules havingto be devised and adopted. The low water inflows also meant that the annual
inflow o f sediment into the reservoir was far less than expected: 0.4 billiontons on average,
as against the predicted 1.3 billiontons. 55 Consequently the reservoir's capacity for flood
control inthe initial years was higherthanpredicted. This inturnallowed the lowest
reservoir level prior to the rainy seasonto be 5 m higherthanthe design, which inturn
meantthat more water was available for supply to urbanareas affected by drought.
Reservoir modeling will continue to be o f great importance becausethe past few years have
shownthat the rate o fdecline o f its live storage capacity has beenquite differentto the
initial planning parameters.

2.80      Itwas estimatedat appraisal that the reservoir would trap 7.5 billioncubic meters
over its first 10 years o f operation. This target has not beenreachedprimarily because o f
the reduced inflow o f sediment to the reservoir. The true measure o fthe efficacy o fthe
sediment management objective is that downstream flood embankments(dykes) have not
hadto be raised thus saving an estimated US$75 million a year.56

2.81      Sediment FlushingOperations.Managingthe highsedimentload o fthe Yellow
Riverpresents the Commissionwith complex andnearly unique challenges. The
experience o fthe very rapid silting up o fthe Sanmenxia reservoir inthe early 1960s
provides valuable lessons for the design o fXia~langdi.~'The needto trap some coarser
sediment while allowing finer silt to passthrough the reservoir was explicitly incorporated
inthe design, which envisaged aprogressive filling upofthe lower levels ofthe reservoir,
while always preservinga substantial amount o flive storage for flood control andwater
supply*

2.82      Eachyear since 2002 inJune/July, prior to the onset o fthe rainy season, the
Corporationhas carried out a controlled `flood' inorder to flush out sediment from the
reservoir as well as to transport out to sea sedimentpreviously deposited further
downstream. A discharge o f at least 2,600 cubic metedsecond (m3/sec) i s drawn from the
lower levels o fthe reservoir and the rip current created erodes deposited silt and transports
it downstream. Each 1,000 cubic meters released removes about 1.5 tons o f sediment and
this is continued for periods ofabout 7-10 days loweringthe lake levelby about 10meters


54. The long-term hydrological series (1919-74) that was the basis for the planning and design studies may
still prove to be valid since 2000-06 i s a relatively short period.
55. As against predicted inflows o f 25-28 billion m3, the actual inflows inthe three years 2000-02 were about
 13 -15 billion m3. Since the dam was closed total sediment inflows are estimated to be 2.6 billion tons, o f
which 0.5 billiontons have since been flushed out
56. Historically, between 300 and 400 million tons o f sediment have been deposited on the riverbed along the
lower reaches every year, resulting in a rise inthe riverbed o f 8-10 centimeters annually. Thus it was
necessaryevery decade to raise 696 km o fthe main dikes at least 1 meter, to strengthen 969 km o f levees, to
raise or strengthen 5,395 spurs invulnerable sites, and to reconstruct or complete 51 channel training works
and 439 spurs totaling 40.8 km.The total present value o f one o fthese decade-long comprehensive programs
was estimated, at appraisal to be at least Y 4 billion ($755 million). These costs were expected to increase
over time as the base o f the dike was widened and as the integrity o f dike foundations was threatened by
seepage and salinity as the riverbed rises.
57. Upstream o f Xiaolangdi inthe middle reach o fthe Yellow River. Despite redesign, modifications and
silt flushing, it now has a live storage capacity o f under 2 billion m3.

                                                       35


and thus creating more flood storage. Whenmixed with fresh water drawn from higher in
the reservoir the highenergy o fthe combineddischarge and its large velocity enable the
riverto transport a higher sediment loadthanit carries and itthus also scours the river bed
downstream.

2.83      The flushing operations have beenremarkably successful. The flow capacity o fthe
main channel o fthe river has beenraised froml,800 m3/secto about 4,000 m3/secas a
result o fthe deepening o f the channel by about 1 m on average. Total silt transported out to
seahas beenestimated at about 260 milliontons as a result o fthe flushing operations. The
Commission's objective i s to restore the river's flow capacity to that o fthe 1970s which
was about 5,000 m3/sec.Outside the rainy season, the average discharge rate downstream
o fXiaolangdi i s maintained at 800 m3/secwith a minimumo f 200 m3/secduring droughts.
Ifdryseasondischarge exceeds800m3/secthere isariskthat sedimentwillbecarried
downstream from Henanprovince to Shandong province but not be flushedto the sea. If
this didoccur itwould riskincreased floods inthose aggradingreaches.

2.84    Research i s beingundertakenby the Commissionto improve sedimentmanagement
intheXiaolangdi reservoir andto achieve the downstream flushingeffects withlower
water di~charges.~~      The sediment discharge ratio (the percent o fincoming sedimentflushed
out) from the reservoir at 18 percent i s already better than the designtarget o f 14percent
andattempts are beingmade to raise this further inorder to prolong the life o fthe reservoir.
Tests are beingundertaken with water releases carrying sediment loads one-third higher
than the highest sustained to date. The combination o fthe lower sediment inflows in2000-
02 and the successful flushing operations means that an additional five years have already
beengained before the reservoir's sedimentstorage capacity of 7.5 billionm3is entirely
filled.

2.85     On the basis o f the experience to date the sedimentmanagement objective has been
fully achieved andefficacy is rated as "high."

Water supply to downstream citiesand industrieswas delivered

2.86     Water shortages inthe lower reaches o fthe Yellow River prior to the construction
o fthe Xiaolangdi project were chronic. Inthe two decadesprior to the project, it was not
unusual for the riverto dry up completely for weeks at a stretch (para 1.15.) Yet despite
drought conditions in2000-02, the water stored inthe reservoir andcontrolled releases
throughout the year have meant that, since 2000, water flow inthe lower reaches o fthe
Yellow River all the way to the sea, and has never beeninterrupted.The ecological benefits
have beenconsiderable: freshwater wetland areas have reappeared, as have fish species that
have not beenpresent since the 1980s. The availability o f silt-free water downstream o f
Xiaolangdi i s also beneficial as it reduces the cost o furbanwater treatment and
sedimentation o f irrigation canals divertingriver water.

2.87     Supplyto major cities such as Tianjinwere maintainedduringone o fthe worst
droughts o fthe past century -a 1in200 year event -despitethe reduced water inflows to


 58. The reservoir had an initial live water storage capacity of 12.6 billion m3, which was expected to
gradually fall to 5.1 billion m3 over 20 years. This level is to be preserved indefinitely thereafter.

the Xiaolangdi reservoir. Indeed,the reservoir provedto bethe only dependable surface
water supply for downstream towns and cities. Meetingmunicipal and industrial demand
for water indry years was not givenmajor prominence at project appraisal, but i s likely to
play a bigger role interms o f water allocation issuesinthe coming years.

2.88    This achievement is partly the result o fexogenous factors andnot attributable
solely to the project. Itwas also the result offorce majeure by the lower riparianprovinces
at the highestpolitical level. Without this interventionXiaolangdi would have been unable
to supply the demand because o fthe water allocation system. This was the result o fthe
Yellow RiverWater RegulationManagement Regulation Stipulation (1998)that was a
responseto the 1997 drying up o fthe river. Underthis newmandate the Commission was
authorized to conduct unifiedwater resources regulation inthe basinandreassign quotas to
eachprovince or autonomous region. Where possible this i s achieved automatically by the
Commissionvia telemetric control from Zhenzhou for 77 important water abstraction sites
and key reservoirs. Quotas are proportionally increased or reduced based on the predicted
total natural runoffmodeledby Commission. As a result o fthese measures annual water
diversions from the Yellow River were maintainedbelow 30 billion cubic meters inthe
period 1998-2001.59

2.89    Controlling the water diversion from the Yellow River was, however, only a partial
solution because demand continued to exceed supply. Thus emergency closure o fupstream
irrigation off-takes was requiredin 1999 to provide essential minimumflow at Sunkou and
Lijinmeasuring stations downstream.60In2000 anemergency releaseofone billioncubic
meters ofwater stored for hydropower generation at Longyanxia dam was neededto
alleviate that year's water crisis inTianjin City on the east coast.61And in2002 a special
high-level delegation from Shandongprovince secured an additional 0.8 billion cubic
meters from the State Council without any compensation for upstream users inNingxia
province and Inner Mongolia autonomous region.62These adhoc adjustments took no
account o fthe opportunity costs o fwater so these emergency allocations are not generally
the most economically efficient solution. Clearly, effective and efficient institutions are at
least as important as engineeringinriver basinmanagement.

Irrigationwater was suppliedwith increasedreliability -but probably not for the
whole of the targeted area of2 million ha

2.90    To fully supply irrigable agricultural land inthe two provinces o fHenan and
Shandong requires the annual diversiono f about 23 billionm3from the river.Prior to
Xiaolangdi total water availability for all end uses was only 32 billionm3with the result
that water for irrigation was always below the biological optimum to maximize crop yields.

Evenafter construction o fthe projectthere is insufficientwater to fully irrigate the total
croplandinthe lower reaches, giventhe needto supply cities and industries.

2.91     Despite the construction o fthe Xiaolangdi project and the additional water made
available by it-4.7 billion m3annually on average over the six years 200-2006 -it i s
estimated that there i s still an annual average shortfall o f 3 billionm3o fwater just inthe
Yellow River basin.63All indications are that this cannot be covered and the shortfall may
even worsen despitemeasuresto increase supply anduse water more efficiently.

2.92     Thus this objective was partially achieved and its efficacy is ratedas "modest" at
best. Lack o f evidence causedby inadequate M&Ewas a major constraint injudging
achievement.

Hydropower generation exceeded expectations

2.93     Itis one o fthe ironies ofthis multi-purpose projectthat the electricity production
from it rates last inthe order o fpriorities, while beingthe sole source o f revenues to pay off
the construction debts and cover the runningcosts o fthe entire operations o f Corporation.
At the same time the hydroelectric plantplays a vital role inthe Henanprovincialpower
supply system.

2.94     Xiaolangdi (1SOOMW) i s the largest generation plant inHenanand accounts for
almost three-quarters o f all hydro inthe province. Although its capacity exceeds the next
largest (thermal) plantsby a third and it has greater operational flexibility, itnow accounts
for less than 6 percent o f the total provincial generation capacity. Xiaolangdi therefore
plays a valuable role inmeetingpeak electricity demand and in2005 its capacity
represented over a tentho f the total demand o f 17,600 MW on the Electric Power o fHenan
(EPH) system. Its size also makes it a key plant for EPHinfrequency regulationand
maintaining grid stability. The fast responsetime o fhydro generation units gives it an
important role inensuringuninterruptedsupply inthe event o f unplanned shutdowns by
thermal plants. Annual generation planstake into account the water supply needs o f urban
and agricultural users and arejointly agreed between EPH, the provincial government and
the Corporation. EPHisthe Corporation's only client.

2.95     The first 300 MW unitwent into service inlate 1999 andthe final one was
commissioned two years later. Although total electricity generation by Xiaolangdi inthe
first three years was substantially below expectations, largely due to drought-induced low
flow, it has exceeded 5,000 GWH inboth 2004 and 2005 and i s expected to continue at
about this level inthe next few years (Table 6). This exceeds the targeted energy
production o f4,773 GWhinthe period 2002-08. At the current average sales price o f




63. One billion m3could irrigate about 200,000 ha if it were all applied to a crop likewheat. However as
about 50% or more will be lost intransit from the river due to seepage from canals actual coverage is more
likelyto be 100,000 ha. Thus the total incremental supply from Xiaolangdi could potentially provide about
0.5 million ha o f surface water irrigation. Inaddition the water lost en route in seepage could be recovered
from groundwater by tubewells perhaps adding up to 0.2 million ha.

                                                      38


about Y 0.32/kWh, this production gives the Corporation gross annual revenues of about
Y1.6 billion(US$ 205 million).64

2.96     Since the project closed the Corporationhas had approvalto construct a small re-
regulating dam, Xixiayuan, 16km downstreamo fXiaolangdi. This will provide daily water
storage to iron out spikes indownstream water releases resultingfrom surges inpower
generation. It will thereby give the EPHdispatch center greater operational flexibility and
reduce the scope for conflicts betweenthe use o f water for power generation andnon-
poweruses. The associated 140MW powerplant will also contribute modestlyto
electricity productionto the tune o f 500 GWWyear. The sale price o f electricity has yet to
befixed. Onthe assumption that the tariffwillbe at least as muchas that as for Xiaolangdi,
the Corporationwill earn anadditional Y160millionannually (over US$20 million) from
this investment. This Y2.2 billionproject i s again beingfundedpredominantly by the
central government on a grant basis. The Corporationwill only be responsible for the debt
service on a commercial loan of Y500 million, which funds the balance o fthe cost.

2.97     Despitethe shortages of electricity inChina duringthe past two years, the
Corporation has not beenable to obtain a significant increase inits powertariff. The price
it is authorized to charge is the outcome ofaprocess involving the buyer (EPH) the Henan
provincial governmentpricing bureau, the NDRC65andits provincial arm, PDRC.
Although the NDRC approved a tariff o f 34.5 fedkwhwith effect from 1/1/2006, the
Corporationhasnotbeen permittedto levy this ratedue to provincialobjections to a
pricehike.

2.98     ElectricityPricing.Onthe other hand, since mid-2004, the Corporationhas been
allowed to charge differentprices for electricity according to the time o f day. Ithas a peak
tariff o f 1.33 times the base rate of 31.7 fen/kWh and an off-peak rate o f 0.55 times the
base tariff during the night hours o f 2300-0700.

2.99     The current level o ftariffs is substantially less thanwas expected by the Bank at the
time ofproject appraisal. Evenafter deductingVAT, the Bank's projections contained in
the PAD for the secondloanassume apowertariff almosttwice that actually levied. The
Bankalso expected atwo-parttariffto beintroduced, with separate capacity and energy
charges. This has not occurred.66Even so, the Corporationhas earned an annual return o f
about 8.6 percent on fixed assets andthis exceeds the Bank's stipulation o f a 5 percent after
2007.

2.100 At the time of the first appraisal, the Bank's analysis o f Xiaolangdi's power tariffs
was baseduponthe cost ofthermal equivalence: that o f a coal-fired plant operating only
four hoursper day to meet peak load. With the prevailingcapital costs and coal price o f



64. Including VAT, that is levied at 17%.
65. Being under the MWR, the Corporation is subject to NDRC's authority on power pricing.
66. The Loan Agreement stipulates in Section 4.07 "Immediately upon commissioning o fthe Xiaolangdi
Dam, charge and collect from all said users, water tariffs sufficient to recover: (i)the costs o f operation and
maintenance o f said dam in full as they are incurred; and (ii)
                                                              the capital costs o f said dam in full not later than
December31,2014."

1993, the resultingfigure for the value o fthe firm energy to be producedby Xiaolangdi
was estimated to be 52 fen/kWh. Although conceptually valid, this estimationwas never
acceptedby EPHor the provincial government as the basis for pricingthe power from
Xiaolangdi. The initial power sales agreement betweenthem [that the Bank requiredas a
condition o fproceeding withthe second loan] merely stated that the price would be set at a
level sufficient to enable the Corporationto fully recover all costs and earn a fair return on
the investedcapital.

Efficiency

2.101 Overall efficiency o fthe project i s assessed as substantial. The EIRR o f 13 percent
as presentedinthe ICR i s probably underestimated since it undervalues the economic
benefits from power and urbanwater supply and does not include any benefits at all from
the improvedecological conditions downstream and inthe delta.

OUTCOME

2.102 The outcome o fthis two-phase project i s rated as highly satisfactory for both
phases. For both projects relevance and efficacy are ratedas highand efficiency i s rated as
substantial. Table 7 summarizes the results by objective and outcome.

2.103 The Corporationi s the first instance inChina o f a financially autonomous water
resource entity, runon `semi-commercial' lines (para 2.115) that i s responsible for
covering its full operating costs and repaying loans contracted for construction. At the same
time, it is underthe control of Commissionregarding decisions relatingto flood control,
urbanwater supplyand reservoir management policies. Equally for power generation, it is
underthe operational control ofEPHfor real-time decisions on generation levels.

2.104 Despite the commercialnature o f its operations, the Corporationhas very little
autonomy since it has no control over the key parameters o f its operations - decisions on
water storage and releases as well as the price andquantity o fthe electricity it generates are
all made by other bodies. This i s understandable since the expertise on water resource
management andthe analytical skills for optimizing the use o fthe Xiaolangdi reservoir as
well as inpower operations andpricing are all located inother entities.

2.105 Duringthe decade prior to the completion o fthe Xiaolangdi project in2002, the
Bankwas heavily involved inassisting the Commission and inbuildingupits analytical
capabilities. Today it i s evidentthat the Commission's technocrats have the full capabilities
to analyze and manage the complex issues relating to the water resources o f the Yellow
River basin. With their access to the latest analyticaltools as well as the possibility to seek
advice from any international experts that they mightwishto consult, it i s clear that the
Bank's institutional development and knowledge management role has beensuccessfully
completed.

RISKTODEVELOPMENT             OUTCOME

2.106 Overall risk i s rated as significant primarily because o f unresolved water allocation
issues and under-priced water. Continued subsidies for capital investmentrisks
misallocationo f resources. While there are potentially highseismic risks, these have been
mitigated inproject design and operation. The sustainability o fthe Xiaolangdi project i s
assured from a technical and financial point o fview becausethe project infrastructure i s
being well maintained and the Corporationi s able to raise enough funds from its sales of
electricity to meet its full 0 & Mrequirements.However, from an economic perspective,
long-term sustainability i s less likely. Continuing water shortages, the modest progress in
addressing issues o f inter-sectoral and regional competition for water use and the political
reluctance to use water pricing as a tool for demand management all tendto undermine
economic sustainability.

2.107 Inter-regional equity and conflicts over water. As pointedout as long ago as 1992
bythe Investment PlanningStudy:

2.108 "...the remote, heavily erodedLoess Plateau and the arid upper reaches of the
Yellow River ...are the least eflcient water users. Delivery andfield losses are extremely
high and many areas must be served by energy-intensivepumping schemes. With
increasingfrequency, Yellow River water will be in short supply, and the water used in
these regions will have an ever higher opportunity cost downstream.Sooner rather than
later, Yellow River planners w ill have to squarelyface equity vs. eflciency issues. ''

2.109 The differences inthe needfor Yellow River water by seasonandby reach create
conflicts betweenupstream and downstream provinces, since their priorities over water use
do not coincide with a basin-wide water allocation formula based on maximizing economic
benefits. 67 The lower reachesare more productive interms o f the annual output o f grains
and their efficiency o fwater use, but farmers have to make do with what i s left after the
upperandmiddlereacheshave drawnofftheir `requirements'. Agricultural output couldbe
raised further ifmore irrigation water was provided to farmers inHenan and Shandong
provinces. The highereconomic value o fwater inthe lower reaches should also translate
into a higherwillingnessto pay for additional irrigation water.

2.110 At present, provinces along the Yellow River are entitledto withdraw annual quotas
o f surface and groundwater that have remained unchanged since a State Council ruling in
1987, despite major shifts inpopulation, urbanizationand industrialization that has taken
place inthe past 20 years. While the Regulation Stipulation o f 1998 allowed the
Commissiontopro rata the quotas to take account o f annual variations inwater
availability, redistribution o fthe quotas i s not allowed. Evenso, upstreamprovinces tendto
withdraw more than their full quotas every year, regardless o f annual rainfall, which puts a
disproportionate burdeno fthe shortfall due to poor hydrology on the downstream
provinces. Altering these provincial quotas and puttinginplace an enforcement mechanism
i s a political `hot potato' for central government that needs to be addressed. And as noted
earlier, downstream provinces are able to bypass official regulationmaking nonsense o fthe
quota allocation system (paras 2.88).

2.111 Taking the Yellow RiverBasinas a whole, there seems to be scope for a rational
reapportioning o fprovincial water offtake quotas insuch as way as to raise overall net
economic benefits. Ina capitalist market system it would be possible to arrive at this end
result by trading water rights. This i s currently not feasible inChina. But it i s possible to
envisage a government administered `trading' scheme to value water, reapportion
provincial quotas and financially compensate those upper and middlereach provinces that
surrender aportiono ftheir quotas to lower reachprovinces.

2.112 An integral element o f such a scheme would be the introductiono f higher irrigation
water charges and volumetric pricing inthe lower reaches inreturnfor guarantees o f
additionalwater supply inthe growing seasons. The upstreamprovinces would receive an
annual payment from the central government to invest inrehabilitatiodupgrading o f their


67. In 1997 water usewas 809m3/muinthe UpperReach, but only 304 m3/muinthe Lower Reach(WB rpt
# 22040, May 2002).

                                                     42


irrigation networks to cut water losses and cushion the impact o f reduced water availability.
   A panoply o f accompanying measureswould also berequiredto improve irrigation and
cultivationtechniques to raise the value added from irrigation water inthe upper and
middlereaches.Unlikelower reaches, water chargesto farmers could be left unchanged
untilirrigationsystemshadbeenupgraded. Fromthenon, highercharges would beneeded
to further encourage the economic use o f water inagriculture.

2.113 Without such direct interventionby the central government more efficient inter-
provincial water use allocations cannot emerge inthe Yellow River Basin. Presently,the
upstream provinces have no incentive to surrender any o ftheir actual water quotas. The
downstream provinces have to make do with what water remains inthe lower reacheso f
the river and evenifthere was a readiness ontheir partto pay for highervolumes, no inter-
provincial trading mechanisms exists to enable this to occur.

2.114 Underpricing ofwater reduces return on investmentand lowerswater use
efficiency. The Xiaolangdi.project has not lived upto the expectations o fthe Bank as
regards the commercialization o fwater supply. Contrary to expectations, the Corporation
does not charge for water or receive any portion o fthe water charges levied by
Commission. Furthermore, water tariffs, particularly for irrigation, remain far lower than
the economic cost o f supply, although at the time o f appraisal by the Bank o fthe first
phase, the Commissionwas supposedly already committed to full-cost recovery pricing.

2.115 Yet inthe Project Agreements with the Bank for both Loans, the Corporation
committed itselfto setting water rates sufficient to cover the full O&M costs right after
commissioning the dam and to achieve full capital cost recovery after 12 years from
commissioning. These undertakingsseemed feasible at that time, and were entirely
consistent with the 1988 Financial Directive o fthe Ministry o f Water Resources that
endorsedmarginal cost pricing for water and complete cost recovery pricing by 1997. But
a decade later it i s apparent that the target was overly ambitious and i s unlikely to be met
for quite some more years to come.

2.116 The Bank raised the bar evenhigher inits loan for Phase 11.The PAD (section 14)
indicated that the Corporation"would initiate chargesfor flood and sediment control
services, which would be appliedas a surcharge on the billsfor end users of Commission -
supplied water." However no formal undertaking to this effect was included inthe legal
documents. The lack o f action since thento introduce such charges i s unsurprising, given
that many view such services as public goods to be providedby the state.

2.117 Onthe other hand, the slow progress inraising user charges for irrigation water and
the lack o f any financial transfers to the Corporation for water from the Xiaolangdi
reservoir i s more difficult to defend. The newwater law o f 2002, inaddition to authorizing
full cost recovery, (including for flood and sedimentcontrol), also makes explicit provision
for a resource cost element inwater charges to reflect scarcity. Translating the law into



68. This would reassurethose provincessurrenderingthe water quotas that compensationwould be paid.
Initially the centralgovernmentwould probably needto allocate additionalbudgetaryresourcesto cover the
cost of the scheme, but it couldequally oblige the downstreamprovinces to transfer some o f the revenues
from higher water charges to cover these payments.

                                                  43


highertariffs is politically difficult. Although Corporation is an enterprise under MWR,
approval o fwater tariffs i s a provincial matter and apart from the political unpopularity it
would face ifit steeply raised water charges, the provincial government i s also
unenthusiastic about a measure that would transfer funds to a central government body.

2.118 In2004 MWR introduced the regulations relating to water tariff settingthat
emanated from the State Council decision designedto promote water conservation. InJuly
2006, water prices inthe lower reaches o fthe Yellow Riverwere raised, but they still do
not contain any elemento f cost recovery for the 0 & Mor capital cost o fthe Xiaolangdi
project. Current bulk water charges leviedby the Commission on supplies deliveredto the
provincial river affairs bureaux are s h o in     ~the Table 8. Subsequentlythese bureaux retail
the water to water user associations with anadded management surcharge.

about 1-2 percent o fthis figure.69A similar disparity was seen inthe Tarim Basin.

2.120 Continued subsidies for capital investmentgive the wrong signals on fiscal
responsibility.Despite Xiaolangdi's lower than anticipated electricity tariffs andthe
absence o f any revenues from water sales, the existing level o ftariffs have proved
sufficient since 2005 cover its O&M expenses, as well as pay the debt service on the loans
contracted for the project (including the IDA credit for the resettlement program). The
financial covenants inthe loan agreement with the Bank have beenmet, with the exception
o fthe rate o f return on the Corporation's total revalued fixed assets, which with hindsight
appearsto have beenoverly ambitious, giventhe difficulty o f imposing charges for flood
control and sediment reduction.

2.121 Prior to 2005 the central government was obliged to cover part o fthe debt service
on the IBRD loans as electricity sales were still rather low and central government only
exemptedthe Corporationfrom VAT in2006. Since 2005 the increase inelectricity sales
has allowed the total debt service relating to Xiaolangdi to decline steadily and in2007 this
i s about Y 640 million (US$78 million), a third less than two years previously. The
windfall from VAT exemption i s worth about Y 70 million (US$8.5 million) a year. As a
result, the Corporation will start to accumulate cash reserves that could be used inpart to
finance new investmentsand/or acceleraterepayment o f outstanding debts. Alternatively,
as a wholly state-owned entity, the government could require the Corporation to pay it an
annual dividendonthe equity initially investedinthe project. At present there i s no

government policy regarding the return on investmentsmade by it inmajor infrastructure
projects and these are treated as 100 percent capital grants. This seems an overly generous
approach inthe case o f revenue-earning enterprises like the Corporation.

2.122 The obligation o fthe Corporationto provide a post-resettlement fund for the
184,040 people displaced by the project was taken over by the MWR due to the inadequate
cash flows o fthe Corporation inthe first few years o f operation. Subsequently, central
government has instituteda national subsidy for resettlers -about Y 600 per capita per year
for 20 years -to assist themto enter the economic main stream. Now that the Corporation
i s financially healthy becauseo fthe large capital grant from central government there i s a
danger that Xiaolangdi could set a precedent that large public revenue-earning enterprises
are not financially responsible either directly or through taxation for the longer-term
negative social impacts they create.

BANKPERFORMANCE

2.123 Overall Bank Performance on Phase Iand Phase I1i s rated as highly satisfactory.
Quality at entry: project designand appraisal were very thorough and o f a highstandard.
Hence quality at entry i s rated as high. Quality o f supervision: the project benefitedfrom
frequent and regular supervision, and long continuity o f Bank staffworking on the project,
particularly through preparatiodappraisal and Phase I.     The postingto the Bank's Beijing
office o fthe project team leader during crucial years o f implementationwas also valuable
inprovidingcloser andeasiercontact withthe project. Supervision quality istherefore
rated as high.

2.124 Inaddition to direct project supervision, the Bank also providedthe government
with significant analyticaland advisory services inthe water sector. For example, the Bank
carried out a comprehensive andwide-ranging study o f water sector issues inNorth China
in2001-02. While itappearsto havebeeninfluentialinshiftingthe government's thinking
at the highest levels, translating it into action seems to be proceeding rather slowly, given
the urgency to addressproblems for which there are no quick fixes.

BORROWERPERFORMANCE

2.125 Borrower performance i s highly satisfactory for the Phase Ithat focused on
construction management, financing and application o f safeguards. Phase I1performance i s
ratedas satisfactory basedon the relative contributions o fthe project and governmental
entities involved inthe project -greater weight being givento slow progress on
institutionalreform andwater pricing.

2.126 The main implementingagency successfully implementeda large and complex
project with many engineeringand management challenges. Inaddition, the project was
completed under budgetand ahead o f schedule. Since completion the Corporation andthe
Commissionhave also demonstrated their capabilities to manage the Xiaolangdi project
facilities to highstandards. For these reasons implementingagency performance i s rated as
highly satisfactory.

2.127 Government Performance under the project i s rated as satisfactory, albeit with some
reservations. Despite the evident in-house expertise inthe Commission and the

dissemination by them o f advice and recommendations on addressing the tradeoffs inthe
use o fYellow River water and water pricing reform, it would seem that political will i s
lacking, particularly at the provincial level, to face upto the hardchoices. Similarly for
many o fthe same reasons electricity tariffs have beenmaintainedat a low level. In
addition, at the national level, it i s unclear yet whether there i s any appetite to face upto the
difficult issue o f intra-provincial water allocation quotas which have remainedfixed since
1988. The problems are well understood and the solutions are clear.

TARIM BASINI1PROJECT

OBJECTIVES

2.129 The Tarim Basin I1Project (Tarim 11) aimed to build on and expand the
achievements o fthe first Tarim IrrigationProject (Tarim I)      that was completed in 1997.
The Tarim Iproject markeda new direction inwater management for the Bank inChina in
that it targeted the majority indigenous peasant populations and the irrigation systems
which sustain the oasis inwhich they live. Its primary objective was to introduce some
advanced technologies to detect and correct for alkalization inarid zone irrigation, improve
soil and water management to preventdesert expansion, and control and mitigate hail
damage to economically vital fruit and vegetables crops. At completion in 1997 the
outcome o f Tarim Iwas ratedas Highly Satisfactory inthe Implementation Completion
Report (ICR). SubsequentlyIEGrated outcome as Satisfactory after a desk assessment in

2.130 Objectivesof Tarim 11. Its three objectives were to increase incomes o fpoor
farmers through irrigated agriculture development; establish systems to ensure sustainable
use, development and management o fwater resources and land inthe Tarim Basin; and

partially restore and preserve the natural riverine forests along the lower reaches o fthe
Tarim River.

2.13 1 Tarim I1effectively replicated the objectives o f Tarim Iinfive new sub-basins thus
extendingmodernwater andagriculturalmanagement techniques to the whole basin.71In
addition Tarim I1objectives put far greater emphasis on institutional development. This
included support to the Tarim Basin Water Resources Commission established in 1997,
prefecture water resources bureaus, self-financing irrigation and drainage districts (SIDDs)
and water user associations. InTarim Iless than one percent o fproject investmentwas
devoted to institutions for integrated river basin management; inTarim I1this increased to
14 percent.

2.132 The project's three objectives were to increase incomes o fpoor farmers through
irrigated agriculture development; establish systems to ensure sustainable use, development
and management o f water resources and land inthe Tarim Basin; and partially restore and
preserve the natural riverine forests along the lower reaches o fthe Tarim River.72These
objectives were to be achieved through 16 components covering physical works and
engineering,land development, voluntary resettlement, agricultural support services and
institutional development. Table 9 summarizes objectives, components and costs.

2.133 The first objective -to increase incomes o fpoor farmers through irrigated
agriculture development -would be the outcome o f success inmeetingthe other two
objectives derivedfrom the synergy generatedby the project components. For example,
increased fresh water inthe TarimRiver would not only regenerate riverineforests but also
forest products and grazing. The third objective -the restoration and preservation o fthe
natural riverine forests inthe lower reaches o fthe Tarim River-would be the result o f
reduced water use inthe basin. This would be the outcome o f more efficient agricultural
water use and better water resources management brought about by improved institutions,
planningandtechnology.

DESIGN

2.134 While the objective to increase farmers' incomes could be fairly easily achieved
through a traditional combination o f engineering upgrades to irrigation infrastructure, better
operation and improved agricultural support services and market access, the other two
objectives were far more challenging. Not only was the project to increase irrigated area by
about 75,000 ha it also hadto save sufficient water to rejuvenate the lower reachesofthe
Tarim River.

2.135 Ensuringsustainable use o f land and water resources was addressedthrough

underthe environmental protectionandmanagement component. Firstthe hydrologic
system-the dynamic relationships betweenannual river and groundwater inflows and
usage, agricultural practices, water storage, systemlosses and the relationship to
waterlogging, soil salinization andwater quality variations -was investigated and
understood. Second, this knowledge was incorporated into a fully calibrated mathematical
model that identifiedthe most critical system improvements neededto conserve water and
augment the lower reaches o fthe Tarim River.Third, the appraisal team recognized that
prefecture administrations neededan incentive to buy into water conservation, particularly
as most prefectures wanted an increase inthe area irrigated and more predictable irrigation
supplies. To this purpose a TarimBasin Water Resources ProtectionFundwas established
to promote investmentsinsub-basin water resources management that would be
implementedbyprefectures.

2.136 The major institutional component -improvement o fthe current water allocation
andlicensing system andcost recovery -was to ensure that water saved could be
reallocated elsewhere. At the apex level this involved buildingthe planning, management
and regulatory capacity o fthe Tarim BasinRiver Basin Commission (Commission) and the
Tarim Management Bureau (Bureau). High-level study tours for senior Commission staff
to river basininstitutions inAustralia and related technical assistance aimed at capacity-
buildingwere financed by AusAid.At prefecture and lower levels capacity-buildingwas
addressedthrough creation o f Water Supply Corporations and pilot water user association
(WAS),attention to management of service delivery and betterO&M.

2.137 Project designmade explicit the relationship betweenimproved service delivery,
water conservation and mechanisms for water fee settingand collectionthrough pilots in
eachprefecture. And these efforts were aided by extensive training and technical assistance
and support inwater resourcesmanagement, irrigation andwater conservancy, and
agronomy. Itwas expectedthat all these efforts would produce a Tarim BasinMaster Plan
and a workable TBRBC with the participation and acceptancethe prefectures by 2001

2.138 The project was not subject to a Quality Assurance Reviewby the Bank's Quality
Assurance Group.

IMPLEMENTATION

2.139 The project was coordinated by a multidisciplinary LeadingGroup under the
leadership of the Region's FirstVice Chairman and the Vice Chairman responsible for
agriculture and water resources. Similar groups were operational ineach of the 5

                                                  49



prefectures and 22 counties comprisingthe project. The MWR's Water Resources Bureau
was responsible for project design, implementation, procurement, river basinwater
management, and development o f self-financing irrigation and drainage districts. The
TarimManagement Bureauunderthe Commissionwas responsible for regionalwater
resourcesplanning and management and civil works on the Tarim River.The Regional
PlanningCommissionwas responsible for reviewingo fthe project work plans, project
monitoring and supervision, and coordination, mobilization and allocationo f counterpart
funding. The Regional Project Management Office (PMO) and PMOs ineach prefecture
were responsible for overseeing project designand implementation. Within the PMOs the
Finance Bureauwas responsible for overall project management and financial
management.

2.140 At the outset there were some serious problems and misunderstandingsbetween the
regional and prefecture PMOs about the objectives o fthe project, andpoor coordination
and cooperation. Misunderstanding stemmed from the common view that the project was to
reduce water use inthe upstream areas andtransfer the saving to downstream. Thus many
prefecture chiefs, particularly those inupstreamareas, felt that the basin-level management
gave insufficient weight to their opinions andthe interests. More focused outreach and
publicity efforts by the TMB started a year into the project and by 2001 a commonvision
o f water conservation gained credibility among basin stakeholders at all levels.

2.141 Inadequate staffing, poor coordinationand cooperation at senior levels plaguedthe
first halfo fproject and heldup attempts to apply unifiedmanagement and regulation to the
basin. The incomplete complement o f senior staff, allied with insufficient and uneven
fundingfor management activities, contributed to a lack goodcommunicationamong the
TMB, the RegionalWater Bureauandthe RegionalPMO on integrated water and land
resourcesmanagement. It was only inmid-2001 whenthe Regional Government's leaders
-andtheregionalFinanceBureau(thelocalarmoftheMinistryofFinance)-tooka
greater interest inthe project that a full-time Standing Vice-Director was appointed to
manage the project. This with other senior appointments, and transfer o fhighly motivated
staff to key positions, greatly accelerated progress andthe investmentcompletion rate
increased from 42 percent to 90 percent over the period 2002-03.

2.142 Despite managerial improvements counterpart fundingwas problematic, slowing
implementation untilmid-2002. Counterpart fund allocation, timingand amounts were not
well harmonized with the project's requirements,particularly at county and prefecture
levels. The multiplicity o f funding sources - seven regionalAoca1 and one central agency73-
exacerbatedthe issue and annual shortfalls. Central funding was not immune to shortfalls
either in2000, for example, there was no financial support from MWR for the Regional
       -
Water Bureau whose activities ground to a halt as a result. The Bank-proposed "Water
ResourcesProtection Fund"was inbreach o f central government rules and policies and this
hinderedfinancial support for Commission. Ingeneral the shortage o fcounterpart funding



73. For example, in 1999 counterpartfunds o f Y272 million(US$34 million)were due from: CountiesY118
million(43%); PrefecturesY42 million (15%); Comprehensive AgriculturalDevelopmentFundY34 million
(13%); RegionalCottonFundY30 million (1~`XO);Reliefkaborfund Y20 million (7%); Water Resources
BureauY12.3 million (4.5%); andRegionalFinanceY5.2 million (2%) and local farmers.

                                                 50



was a serious problem for progress onthe capacity-building and institutional aspectso fthe
project until2002 -irrigation and drainage engineeringwas less badly affected as it was
drivenby local demand. Accordingly farmers' labor contributionwas generally more than
planned. Local funding ceasedto be a problem after 2002 whenthe independentand
centrally-funded Y10.6 billion(US$l.3 billion) Tarim Basin Water Resources
RehabilitationProgram topped-up local contributions.

2.143 Procurement, despite beinggivendetailed by the Bank attention during appraisal,
exacerbatedthe counterpart fundingproblem causing delays inproject works, technical
assistance, Self-financing IrrigationDistricts (SIDD) pilots andresearch and
implementationo fManagement Information Systems (MIS).Major problems were
unfamiliarity with internationally accepted norms, insufficient staff and financial support at
provincial and county levels, poor coordinationinthe regional PMO, and failure to follow
Bank norms and procedures for procurement. While proactive supervision and additional
training provided corrective action inmany cases this was not always sufficient. An ex-post
field reviewo fcontracts in2004, for example, found that almost 60 percent o fcontracts
examined hadprocurement issues, the most common being inadequate attentionto
advertising bidpackages, inconsistent biddingdocuments andprequalification. Evenso,
none were sufficient to invalidate disbursement.

2.144 Giventhe various delays the project closing was extendedby one year after mid-
term review (MTR, June 2002) and some o fthe project components were adjusted.
Objectives remained unchanged. The main changes introducedat MTR following pressure
form the Bank were a 55 percent reductioninland reclamationto about 41,000 ha driven
andanincrease inlow-yield landimprovement by 22 percent or 23,200 ha. These changes
curtailed irrigation expansion and enabled water to be usedmore efficiently inline with
basin development objectives.

Monitoring and Evaluation

2.145 Design. The project gave great importance to Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
and the establishment o f baselines, but providedonly modest guidelinesfor reporting
inputs, outputs, outcomes and impacts. The PlanningDivisions o feach level ofPMO
managedthe M&Eprocess focusing on inputs/outputs and environmental indicators. Each
year there was independentM&Eo fkey socio-economic performance indicators. Halfthe
project counties (11) were covered by the Regional Agricultural Department's Rural
Economic Stations, the balance by Xinjiang's Agricultural University School o fEconomics
and Management. The impact o fthe project was captured by M&E o f 1,100 households
that includes about 6,000 people.74A survey selected 50 households from 3 townships and
3 villages stratified according to average income (high, medium, low) ineach o fthe 22
counties. Inaddition, sample selection included one non-project todvillage for each two
withinthe project area. While the selectedhouseholds are described as "random" this is not




74. The survey included 6,491 peoplein 1998 and by2003 this had declinedto 5,962. Thus the sample ratio
was slightly over 1:1,000.

                                                      51



the case. The Chinese designteam told IEGthat at the village level the households were
purposely selected by the local heads o f admini~tration.~~

2.146 Implementation. The baseline was satisfactorily established inNovember-
December 1998. Although annual longitudinal surveys hadbeenplannedthis was only
achieved for macroeconomic indicators gathered by state statistical agencies and the
household surveys contacted to independentnon-project agencies. Project agencies (with
some exceptions) only startedto take M&Eresponsibilities seriously with the 2002 change
inmanagement andlocalfunding(paras 2.141). Procurement o fessential MISequipment
was only completed in2001 and installation at prefecture level in2002. Thus
comprehensive monitoring data for all indicators are only available for 2003 and 2004 -
eventhenthe M&Ebudgetwas reduced by a thirdinthe last two years o fthe project.76

2.147 At the completion o fthe project funding for M&E ceased. While detailed
monitoring o f inputs and outputs i s continued routinely at all levels, the cessation o fthe
Tarim I1M&Eledto a lack o f focus on evaluating date collected and loss o fthe
independentassessmento f outcomes and impacts. This is a major failing as the project
benefit stream was still growing (e.g. orchards and the cumulative effects o fbetter water
management.) Given the modest cost o fthe exercise - US$37,000 a year for Xinjiang
University's survey o f 11 counties -andthe US$1.3 billionallocated to the follow-on
Tarim Basin Water ResourcesProgram -this demonstrates little official concern for
demonstrating, rather than asserting, impacts.

2.148 Utilization.Until2002 many o fthe requiredperformance management indicators
were inadequately monitored. This adversely affected planning for implementation o fwater
and environmental conservation measures and O&M, particularly at provincial level, and
was heavily criticized duringthe Bank's first six supervision missions. Subsequently,
attention to M&E improvedand this enabled improvements to project designand
implementationafter mid-termreview.

2.149 Monitored data were extensivelyreported by the project and provide a wealth o f
indicators and other information from which to infer project outcome and impact.77There
were a numbero f shortcomings. First, a comprehensive evaluation o fall the data was
hinderedby differing data protocols: Xinjaing Universitymaintaineda computerized data
base; the RuralEconomic Stations kept only manual records. Second, although there were
without project controls, the quality o fthese was eroded by the expansion o f the project
area and spillover effects. Thus by the end o fthe project instead o f one control for two
project samples, there was only one control for 4.7 project sample t~wn/villages.~*

Although IEGinterviews o f XinjianUniversity staff confirmed the existence o f basin-wide
none-project controls none o fthese data are presentedinthe official evaluation reports or
were made available to IEG.Thus project impact was determinedfrom a single difference
"before and after" approach including all the sample households. This may give a slight
downwardbias to estimated project impact as it includes an unspecifiednumbero f "non-
project" households. IEGwas also informed that there was no formal attempt to triangulate
household findings with other independent surveys.79

SafeguardCompliance

2.151 Five safeguard policies were invoked by this project.

2.152 Environmental assessment (OD 4.01) at appraisal categorized this project as "B."
However, becausethe project includedthe new large dam at Xinir ina seismically active
area and 75,350 ha o fnew irrigation on reclaimed land it should have been classified as a
category "A" project.'' The regionjustified its `B" categorization on the basis that: the dam
would provide water from ecological purposes; there was no involuntary resettlement; land
restoration would reverse negative environmental impacts from earlier poor water
management; that China's own environmental screening and mitigation plans were a
satisfactory substitutefor the Bank's policy; andthat this was normal practice for Bank
projects inChina. The debate about the correct environmental classificationo f agricultural
andwater projects inChina is not newas shownby the InspectionPanel findings onthe
Western China Project." IEG's reviewo f the Bank's water policy pointedout that the
dilemma o f safeguard policies i s that unless they are mainstreamed by borrowers, they
primarily serve to protect the Bank from risk and criticism.82As the mitigation o f
environmental impacts o f this dam was screenedby NEPA and Chinese experts, as well as
an independentdam safety panel (OP 4.07) approved by the Bank, and there have beenno
reported problems, IEGrates the Bank as satisfactory on application o f its environmental
safeguards-this i s reinforcedby the due diligence to verify impacts.83

2.153 IndigenousPeoples(OD 4.20). While the project also significantly affected
indigenous people who are the majority inthe area, they are greatest beneficiaries and fully
participated inall project activities. Within Aksu prefecture poverty and miniscule land
holdings (1.3 muor 0.9 ha per capita) lacking dependable water supplies induced almost
13,000 Uygur farmers to opt for voluntary relocation from the poorest areas o f Keping
county to the Laiqilang irrigation subproject. After screening to target viable immigrants,
10,000 farmers were each offered 4 muo f irrigatedreclaimed land. IEGwere informed that

2.154 Involuntary Resettlement(OP 4.30). No involuntary resettlement was foreseen at
appraisal. However, the PAD cautioned that it could occur as alignment o f canals and
drains was finalized as insurance theBank and the Regional Government agreed a
                         -
ResettlementPolicy Framework that fully complied with OD 4.30.

2.155 InJune 2000 the Bank's supervision team found about 30 percent o f sites inspected
involved land acquisitiono fwhich one include involuntary resettlement. The Laodahe
canal involved relocation inMarch2000 o f a primary school and 4 farmsteads, acquisition
o f 1,388 mu(92.5 ha) o f land, and related assets o f 273 farmers.84 The supervisionteam
found that compensation rates were generally lower and not incompliance withthe
resettlement policy framework.

2.156     A secondresettlement missionmetwiththose responsible inFebruary2001,
mitigationwas agreed andthe June 2001 supervision missionreported full compliance. The
average income o f all 273 project-affected people was improved substantially as a result o f
the project. IEGvisited 21Brigade, Ayikule TownofAksu, andmet withthose resettled
who confirmed they hadbeenfully compensated. The increased focus o fresettlement
predatedthe construction o fthe Xinir dam and ensured the region's attention to agreed
compensation policies.      85


2.157 Internationalwaterways (OP7.50). The headwaters o fthe tributaries ofthe Tarim
Riverrise inthe Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan. As there was no adverse effect onthe
quantity or quality o fwater flows to other riparians the Bank's regionalvice president
approved an exception inAugust, 1997.

2.158 Integrated Pest Management (OP 4.09). The value o f crop losses to pests inthe
project area averaged US$86 million a year and control was primarily through application
o f chemicals pesticides. ElsewhereinChina poor pest management on cotton had
significantly reduced yields o fthis nationally important crop. Thus IPMwas justified for
economic and environmental reasons. The project, supported by AusAidtechnical
assistance, successfully carried out training o ftrainers to buildthe capacity o fthe Regional
Plant Protection Department and prefectures. The initial proposalto train farmers directly
and empower them to make decisions about timing and application o f IPMproved to be
unworkable -too many farmers to train, official reluctance to delegate IPMdecisions to



84. The Bank's Resettlement Thematic Supervision Mission (June 8-15,2000) inspected 23 locations
within16 water projects in4 prefectures- Kizilsu, Kashgar, Bayingol and Aksu. Most involved less than one
ha and were on state land. The mission report noted: the RegionalAgricultural Division was aware of
possible land acquisition inthe field, but no reports.. ..The Yes o fNo involuntary resettlement is checked by
the RegionalPMO from the 5 prefecture PMOSthrough telephones.There is no efficient and accurate
reporting system to check whether there is any land expropriated or house demolished for construction o fthe

almost three-fold to Y 2,584 per year. People interviewedby IEGat 21 Brigade Village indicatedthat their
incomes had "risen a lot because o fthe project but this could not be verified.

Relevance

2.160 The objectives o fthe Tarim I1Project were clearly highly relevant to the Bank's
landand water strategies and CASs interms o fwater conservation and environmental goals
and poverty alleviation. The choice o f a river basinwhose institutions for management are
unifiedwithinone province provided simplifiedconditions that enabled piloting o fnew
approachesto management that were unfettered by inter-provincial differences inviews,

indicate that the impact of increasedirrigationon productionwas marginal. Iffact, the

a result o f ma'or price declines incotton and grains that accounted for 90 percent of sown

89. With one fourth o f global output, one fourth o f cotton stocks, and approximately 30% o fworld
consumption, China plays a major role incotton, affectingthe movements inprices. From 1994 to 1998
Chinese cotton farmers produced 102.9 million bales o f cotton while Chinese mills consumed 97.1 million
bales, adding to their domestic cotton stock. During that same period the Chinese government, through
various agenciesthat control cotton reserves, imported 12.5 millionbales o f cotton increasing their annual
carryover stocks from 10.8 million in 1994 to 26 million bales in 1998, and China held 52% o f the world's
cotton stocks. This extraordinary turn o f events createdsome o fthe strongest cotton prices seen in 30
years. Then, as the Asian financial crisis plunged virtually all internationallytraded commodity prices to 40-
year lows, the Chinese government beganto dump cotton from their stocks and pushedworld cotton prices
even lower. Source:National Cotton Council of America. February II,2005

 1999, recovering to $5,122 in2001 and again sliding to $591 in2002. Maize export prices fell from $158 ton
by almost 25 percent over the period 1998-2000 and remained fairly stable around $120/ton until2004 when
prices doubled. Wheat export prices increasedsteadily 1996-2000 to $$943/ton but dropped steeply reaching
a low o f $282/ton in2003- but rising to $476/ton in2004. Source:faostat.fao.org. 30 April 2007.

remained fairly constant for the mediumincome group according to the ICR (Table 11).
The reasons for this are unclear andthe M&Edata made available to IEGprovide no
answer. Despite these improvements there still appearsto be insufficient income for
schooling for some o fthe poorest - over a fifth o f surveyedhouseholds have childrenwho
have not attended school, and 80 percent o fthese households gave "lack o f money" as the
reason.92 Evenso, there i s no evidence that living expendituresare beingboosted by the
sale o f household assets. Quite to the contrary, asset accumulation has occurred.

2.167 First reduction instate taxes and itemshandedover to the state collective increased
farmer's incentives to become more productive. Overall taxation was cut by more than half
and it accounted for only 9 percent o fnet income in2003.93Household expenditureon
durable goods increasedinall areas (Figure 6.) although Hetianprefecture, the poorest,
showed only modest gains. Average household area was expandedby over 30 percent and
there was a shift towards more durable quality construction -almost a tentho f homes

six months before the project was approved, the Commissionwas guidedby the
"Regulations on the Management o fthe Water Resources o f the Tarim Basin'' approved by
the RegionalPeoples' Congress.The primarypurpose was to ensure that water resources
development and management would be under a systemo f unified administrationand
management, according to five principles:

  0   rational development, utilization, protection and management o fthe water resources
      o fthe Tarim Basin,
  0   exercise control over water disasters,
  0   filly derive the comprehensive social, economic and ecological/environmental
      benefits o fwater resources,
  0   ensure the sustainable development o f the national economy inthe basin, and
  0   improve the livelihood o fthe people and the environment" inthe basin.

2.171 The Commission i s composed o ftwo parts:the Board o f Commissioners (called a
"Standing Committee" inPRC comprising 14members that meet twice a year); and the
TarimBasinManagement Bureau. The Regulations combinedthe two entities into one
organizational framework, gave them enhancedresponsibilities and accountability, and
providedmechanisms to secure adequate funding. A small Executive Committee was
appointed by the Boardto act on its behalfbetweensessions.94Prior to the formation o fthe
Commissionthe Management Bureauoversaw all activities and attempted to reconcile the
differences among the prefectures inorder to promote regulations for water licensing and
use according the China Water Law. However, being confined to the mainstream o f the
Tarim River they lackedthe authority and status to bringthe prefectures together, and were
independento fthe Standing Committee. Similarly the Committee was unable to address
the inter-jurisdictional issues adequately partly due to their structure andpartly due to their
composition. Thus, at the beginningo fthe project the institutional framework for water
planning and management was weak and ineffective and integrated water resources
management was absent.

2.172 Most o fthese weaknesses were resolved by effective Bank supervision that helped
clarify the details andrationale o fthe reorganization and facilitated agreement among
stakeholders inthe first two years o fthe project. A five-year development plan for the
basinwas approved by the Standing Committee inAugust 1998. More importantly, in 1999
the Boardagreed to give greater representation to the prefectures. With a 14 memberboard,
the five prefectures felt they hadlittle chance to represent their interests duringthe two
annual meetingo fthe Standing Committee. And duringthe interim,the Executive
Committee (that hadno representation from the prefectures) could take action on matters
delegated to it by the Standing Committee, which may not be inthe interest o fthe
prefectures. A rule change was agreedthat would require concurrence o f at least three o f
the five prefectures concurrence inthe Standing Committee voting, andthat one or more
prefecture representatives would be members at large to the Executive Committee.

2.173 Despite these rearrangements o fthe Commission it still provedto be very difficult
to reach agreement on allocationandregulation o fwater use inthe basin- eventhough the
first quotas had beenintroduced in 1988 under the Regional Water Resources
De~artment.~~    The primaryreason givento IEGwas that the goal o fthe Commission was
to rejuvenate the flow o fthe lower Tarim River was at odds with increased use o fwater
that was neededto meet the goals o fthe 1Oth Five-Year Plan. Specifically key goals o f
prefectures (inter alia, to double farmers' incomes and the prefectural contribution to
regional GDP) would bejeopardized with reduced water availability. Although there was a
two-thirds majority initially insupport o fwater quotas in 1999this broke down and
eventually (2002) the Commissionworked with the regional government to impose quotas
to bringclosure to the debate.

2.174 These quotas are imposed on the prefectures and fines are leviedifthe quotas are
exceeded.96Traditionally most prefectures have taken more thentheir quota while at the
same time continuing to extend irrigation infra~tructure.~~Fortunately, an effective dispute
resolution system forms part o fthe Commission and this was satisfactorily resolved. Thus
while most prefectures agreeto reduced water quotas, the date for reaching targetvalues
have recently beendelayed from 5 to 15 years. Indications are that average usage inexcess
o f quotas i s about 20 percent and that most prefectures have agreed to reduce consumption
by about 10percent per year.98

2.175 Local institutionsfor water management significantly improved -but not as
planned.Prefecture Water Resource Bureaus effectively manage water allocation to next
level down, the counties, usingthe nationally-approved water withdrawal permit system.
At this level six Water Supply Corporations (WSCs) were supposedto receive the bulk
water supply and retail it via contracts to newly-created and self-managed Water User
Association that, inturn, allocates it to the farmers. Inpractice it was found that the WSCs
duplicated many o fthe functions o fthe exiting prefecture and county water bureaus and
only one inAksuprefecture (serving 19 W A S )was still active at project completion. Also
it was foundthat WSCs becameanextension ofthe township water bureaus andadopted a
paternalistic approachto management that precludedW A Staking full responsibility for
their ownaffairs.




95. The quotaswere developed by the RegionalWater ResourceBureau("top down") on the basis ofregional
water balances, actualand proposed infrastructureand cropping system, and other water demands.
Subsequentlythis was supplementedand adjustments madeon the basis of detailedwater balancesconducted
throughthe project at country level ("bottom up"). Both could be conducted independentlybut as the
knowledgebase is built there will be aconvergencetowards a commonly agreed quotavalue. Thus acounty
could aim to save water through engineeringand management improvementsand put part ofthis saving
towards reducingits use to meetthe Bureaus quotaand part towards servingnew irrigation or other water
demandssuch as industry.
96. In2003 Aksu Prefecturewas fined 10,000 RMB for exceeding its quotabecause subdivisions 1and 2
exceededtheir sub-quota. They, inturn, were fined 6,000 RMB.
97. In2001, for example, the Kizilsuprefectureargued that althoughits historical usage was 0.107 billion m3,
new irrigation constructionover 130,000 mu (8,700 ha) would pushtheir requirementto 0.196 billionm3.
The quotaproposedby the Bureauwas 0.135 billion m3.
98. This information from IEG interviewswith Bureauofficials inUrumqi partially contradictsthe mostly
"full compliance" notedbythe 11" SupervisionMission(para 11) in2003.

2.176 Upgraded or new irrigation and drainage infrastructure met all the project's physical
targets andthis providedtimely andreliable water supplies that increased agricultural
prod~ctivity.~~  This fully functioning system providedthe basis for the establishment o f
viable WUAs whose numbergreatly exceeded appraisal expectations: 15 against the 8
planned. Inaddition another 208 were establishedbefore project closure and by the time if
the IEGmissionthis hadreportedlyincreasedto over 1,500 including those outside the
project areabecause o fthe Regional government's "Delivering water to Households"
program that aimed to engage farmers ina more participatory approach.loo                  Onthe whole
IEGfound from a series of field interviewsthat most WUAs are effective inmanaging and
conserving water at the local level, but not without problems (Box).

2.177 Some WUAs are inname only -farmers do not actively participate intheir
management. The share o f "paper" WUAs i s not known. Inmany o fthe poorer areas that
IEGvisited, farmer's literacy is low (reportedly about 20 percent) andthe country officials
take the initiative to organize the WUA and then runit as an extension o fthe township,
water bureau or state enterprise. For example, at the tail end o fthe Dongfeng main canal in
Aksuprefecture the TienFeng Seed Company (a state enterprise) manages one o fthe
project's pilot WUAs that i s part o f a SIDD that includes 8 villages created on 11,000 mu
(733 ha) o f reclaimed saline soils. Comprising 3 villages the farmers inthe WUA neither
manage budgetnor water -everythingi s done by the state enterprise staff-but they do
undertake O&M withinthe command area. Water tariffs are calculated from the cultivated
area, not volumetrically. Despite beinga "paper" WUA water management followed the
conservation principles inthe project designand the state enterprise staff were assiduous in
collecting water fees and ensuring O&M was undertakenby beneficiary farmers. This
confirms the findings o fresearch inNingxiaand Henanprovinces that, when implemented,
water management reform leads to water savings and meets the primary goal o f water
sector officials.'0' This study also noted increases infarmer's incomes appeared to more
closely allied with manager's incentives thanwater reformper se -although reform may
lower farmer's overhead costs (Box 2) and reduce water bills.




99. 123,373 ha of land were improved and 41,462 ha o f land were reclaimed. This included 1,009 km o f
main canals; 1092 km o f main drains; 98 reservoirs and live storage; 29 water resource measuring stations;
2,340 kmo f lateral canals; 3,108 km o f field canals and 20,846 water control structures.

water measurementand accounting and application o f volumetric charging.

Irrigation and Drainage Districts are not self-financing

2.178 The concept of SIDDS has taken a firm root inthe basin and IEGfound compelling
evidence that accounting and billing procedures for water has been mainstreamed within
the project area. Billings actually collected were generally better than 90 percent. But none
ofthe SIDDs visited was fully self-financing. The primaryreasons are that water tariffs are
too l o w and do not cover costs, and that the prefectural authorities prefer to reduce taxes
and fees on poor farmers and subsidize water management activities. Inthe Qinbuluguqi
WUA ofAksu prefecture, officials indicatedthat the present water fee of0.0594 RMB/m3
wouldhave to increase by about 30 percent to cover the SIDD's costs. Table 12 shows how
water fees are collected and allocated inthis area.

Box 2: GrowingWUAs the experienceof Mousonma Irrigation District, Kashgar prefecture
                             -
          The project started a pilot self-financing irrigation and drainage district (SIDD) from an initial WUA
that included 5 villages served by a 14.3 km lateral, mostly unlined, canal covering 4,500 mu(300 ha). 150
local officials were trained inWUA management and improving water use efficiency and this was extended
to 200 farmers from 17 townships and 22 villages. Overseas study tours were paid for by the prefecture. Over
the period 1998-2000 about 13 km (81%) o f the branch canal feeding the lateral canal were lined and 63
water control structures installed (including 57 water measuring points and 4 water level controls). By 2003
the county included 21 W A Scovering 209 villages and 66,915 households over an area o f 589,570 mu
(39,304 ha). The water supplyto the WUAs is managed by the Water Bureau on the basis o f cropping
patterns, water demands and schedules compiled bythe individual W A S .The W A Smain functions are to:
          *** plan
              raise awareness o f water conservation techniques and apply them;
                   and manage distribution o f water with the command area and provide O&M;
              arbitrate disputes, audit supplies and collect water tariffs.
Main problems:
          *The portion o fthe water tariff retained by the WUAs covers only halfthe required O&M, in
consequence there have been canal breaches and wastage o f water;
          **  The project neglected to upgrade on-farm irrigation distribution facilities;
              Water tariffs are too low. The prefecture sets the base rate and this is implemented by the county
with upward adjustments for local circumstances. Eventhough the county has the final authority over the
actual rate, prefectural concerns to reduce the burden on poorer farmers normally means that the county has
no say inthe tariff actually charged to farmers;
          * About    a third o fthe tariff revenue raised from the W A Sis used by the county for flood fighting
and reliefworks; and
          *   The pilot WUA's 3 technical staff are free inthat they are paid for bythe water resources bureau
and the village committees from other income.
Advantages (as reportedby a Group Headwho farms 11mu and manages supplies for 41 households):
          ****Before the project it took 40 hours to distribute the water, it now takes 3 hours;
              Earlier every household had to send people to ensure their fair share; now we trust the WUA
              Earlier we had many quarrels over water, now almost none;
              Earlier we paid 50 RMB per household for water, now we pay 30 RMB mainly because rules are
obeyed, water losses are reduced and management is improved;
          *** We undertake O&M and the WUA members agree to pay extra for this - normally inkind;
              We have diversified cropping to vegetables and fruits ingreenhouses usinggrants from county
              Household income was 3,500 RMB, now it is 6,000 RMB.

2.180 A notable accomplishment was the introduction o fthe conjunctive use o f surface
and groundwater to minimize evaporative losses o fwater.Io3Among the many water
conservation measures successfully promotedby the project were use o f plastic tube and
greenhouse cultivation, mulching and hightechnology drip and spray irrigation.

2.18 1 An alternative explanation -or contributory one - i s that perhaps the supply of
precipitation to the basin inthe form o frain and snow has slightly increased. Conversely, if
precipitation was less this would augment the project's achievements. This was not


103. Lowering the groundwater table through improved drainage reduces the rise o f water to the surface
through capillary action and thus evaporative losses and salt accumulation at the surface. Flood flows from
the mountainous rim o fthe basin percolate into the piedmont slopes and were captured through the
installation o fwell fields and supplemented surface water supplies downstream. Reducing the area o f water
stored in shallow surface reservoirs duringthe hot dry summers by either not constructing them at low
elevations (e.g. at Louhuluke) or replacing them with high elevation supplies all greatly reduced non-
beneficial evaporation.

investigated duringthe project and as far as IEGcan determine was not even considered in
the results chainof cause andeffect. This is a notableomission that should be investigated
before it can befirmly concluded that man-made improvementsare solely responsiblefor
the improved environmentalsituation.

2.182 Whatever the cause, water savings have allowed six separatewater deliveries
totaling 1.7 billion m3to be made to the lower river "green corridor" since 2000. This has
allowed expansion o fthe area o fterminal lake systems at Taitema from zero to 200 km2.
The increased river flows andthe reinstatement o fthe lake systemhave resultedinthe
water table rising between 3.2 m and 12.6 m inthe lower river reach and a halving o fthe
mineral content o f groundwater from 4-5 g/1to 2-3 g/l.

2.183 The increased supply o f better quality water has rejuvenated trees, shrubs and
grasslands on both sides o fthe river providing food, shelter andwater for wildlife and
people. Twenty-fivespecies o f native birds, amphibians, reptiles, 11 species o f fish and
other wildlife, such as reddeer, have also returned. Tree ring analysis o fPopulus
Divesifoliu (called huyang inChinese) showed a dramatic increase ingrowth rates after
2000 andthe area under huyang inthe basin increasedover the period 1998-2003 from
 158,941 ha to 175,016 ha. This notable environmental achievement receivednational and
international press coverage.lo4

the overall project was recalculated inthe ICRat completion basedonbenefits generated
from landreclamation component and from diversification to higher-value crops. The
recalculated ERR i s 19percent compared to 14 percent estimated at appraisal. The Net
Present Value (NPV) achieved was Y675 million at completion compared to the appraisal
estimate o f Y411 million. The major difference between the economic analyses carried out
at appraisal and that done at completion i s that the appraisal under-estimated the scale o f
diversification into higher-value agriculturalproductionand also the assessment o f
increases inmajor crop productivity. These higher benefits were offset to a degree by lower
economic costs at ICR compared to appraisal because o f China's entry into the WTO.

2.185 Inspite o f a significant downturn incotton, wheat and other prices had a major
impact on the project inthe first and second years, with a corresponding reduction in
house-hold incomes, the Financial Rate o f Return(FRR) for the overall project at
completion was 16percent. The appraisal estimate o f 17percent was made based on
market prices prior to China enteringthe WTO and includedallowances for the distortions
inthemarketatthe time andhigherfinancial prices. A morerecent and independent
estimate o f the costs and benefits o f growing fruit inAksuprefecture gives very favorable
FRRsfor apples andpearsunderpresent agronomic practices. Itnotes, however, that
profits would be evenhigher iftrees were better prunedandmechanizationwere introduced

as labor accounts for almost a thirdo ftotal cost~."~   Thus it is likelyfuture benefitscould
bemuchhigherthan anticipated at completion.

2.186 This assessmentbelieves the actual ex-post economic rates o f return usingthe same
economic and financial models could be lower. This i s becausethe cost stream inthese
calculations only captures costs directly attributable to the project and fully attributed 4
benefitsto these inputs alone. Yet we know that other internationalsources o ffunding
supported development inputswhich directly or indirectly benefitedthe project, as did
China's own regional investments.Inaddition, there were manyregional, prefectural and
country inputs- such as China's own comprehensive agricultural development program.
Also much o fthe O&M expenditurei s giveninfree labor and not included. Balancing
these downside factors, none o f upside environmental or social benefits from the project i s
included either. Itmay well be that these factors cancel out ifcosts and benefits canbe
quantified.

OUTCOME

2.187 The outcome o fthe project i s ratedas satisfactory. Thejustifications for this rating
are summarized inTable 13 and elaborated below.

substantial Chinese development financing for water development withinthe basin, six
other external agencies provided developmental support. The ADB assisted development o f
local highways that facilitated development o f local markets and commerce. The UK's

development in 15 prefectures. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia were also supportive. For these
reasonsthe ICR rating o fhighly satisfactory was downgraded to satisfactory.

RISKTO DEVELOPMENT          OUTCOME

2.189 Overallrisk to development outcome is rated as moderate. The mainrisk factors
contributingto this rating are economic, technical, governmental, financial and exposure to
natural disasters. Local stakeholder, social, financial and environmentalrisks are low.

2.190 Economic and technical risks relate mainly to agriculture - cotton and grains in
particular - and are moderate to high.The volatility of internationaltrade incotton and
grains at the start o fthe project clearly demonstrated the major role these play sustaining in
farmer's incomes, and the risk factors are still moderate to high(footnote 84.)'06 This risk
i s compounded by technical ones causedby the widespread adoption o f genetically
engineered cotton knownas biotechnologyor Bt-cotton. The first risk i s continued
inadequate institutional support and extension guidance for Bt-cotton that causes over-
application, misuse or mishandling o fpesticides essential for the continuedhealth o fBt-
cotton andthat have potentially adversehealth and financial impacts on farmer^.''^ The
second i s the risk o f second
purchasing Bt-cotton seeds.     3Risksto
                                     pest infestation(stink bug) and the continued highcost o f
                                               grains are primarily changing government policy in
China and the effect of internationalprices on local producer^.'^^

2.191 Continuedgovernment subsidiesto SIDDs, ifsignificantly reduced or curtailed,
pose a low to moderate riskto the physical maintenance o f infrastructure constructed under
the project. And ifthe effectiveness o fthis infrastructure is put at risk, water conservation
may bejeopardized and with it the "green river." There i s also a risk that continued
subsidies for water costs may underminethe rational for water conservation, giventhe
prevalence o f low water tariffs throughout the basin, andthe uncertain or marginal
financial viability of WUAs.

2.192 The easternpart o fthe Tarim basinexperienced a major earthquake in2001that
damaged infrastructure and slowed project implementationinthat area. Giventhe
proximity to active plate boundaries the likelihood o fthis risk remains moderate but local
impacts could be large.

BANKPERFORMANCE

2.193 Overall Bankperformancewas highly satisfactory.Designand appraisal i s rated
as highly satisfactory. Innovative project designreflectedboth the Bank's Water
ResourcesManagement strategies andthose o fthe China' central government and the
region. The Bank's extensive global learning and experience was appliedto the project and
partnership with AusAidleveraged world renownedtechnical expertise to assist the nascent
river basin commissionto solve its complex water and environmentalproblems.

2.194 Supervision i s rated as highly satisfactory. Attention to fiduciary and safeguard
issues and physical progress was highly satisfactory. Missions were intense and reporting
was excellent. Aide memoirs clearly identifiedthe main implementation and development
issues and advice to the regional government and implementingagencies was clear, direct
andrelevant while being flexible andpragmatic.. Progress towards physicaldevelopment
objectives and emergingrisks were clearly tracked and ratings accurately reflected reality
inthe field.The supervision strategy employed anefficient combinationofthe TTL/Co-
TTL (based inWashington and Beijing, respectively) with clear roles and responsibilities
and the ability to interact with and be responsive to the daily needs o fthe client. The only
downside i s that insufficient attention was givento utilization o f the M&E, particularly the
omissiono fthe climatic variables neededto conclusively demonstrate project impacts on
the regionalwater balance.

BORROWER     PERFORMANCE

2.195 Overall Borrower performancewas satisfactory. The technical aspects o fproject
preparation were highly competent, responsive to the innovative ideas importedby the
Bank and the views o f local stakeholders inthe basin. As a result this technically complex
project was prepared, appraised and negotiated injust 17 months. Borrower preparation,
however, overlookedthe lack o f managerial capacity on procurement and M&Ebelow the
main national and regional agencies andthis later caused implementation delays. Evenso,
the regional government recognized the problem and was assertive ingettingthe project
back on track and ensuringgood leadership.

2.196 The performance o fthe implementationagency was mixed. Very poor initial
performance causedby an inadequate complement o fkey staff, ineffective leadership and
deficient counterpart financing was countered by outstanding performance inthe second
halfonce these problems were remedied.Subsequently there was effective coordination
across agency, technical, administrative and political boundaries. An earthquake impeded
progress over the period 200-2001. As a result, implementation o fthis technically complex
and geographically wide-spread project was completed with a one-year delay.

2.197 Finally, the provincial government's ambivalent approach to raisingwater charges
indicates they still do not see the link betweenprice signals on scarce resources (e.g. water)
and their stated conservation efforts. As this poses a substantial risk to the sustainability o f
irrigation improvements and the adequacy o f water to feed the "green corridor" this
assessmentrates overall Borrower performance as satisfactory.

SUMMARYOFKEYFINDINGSFROMTHE TARIMBASINPROJECT

2.198 There are six:
      Thisproject conclusively demonstratedthat higher crop yields andincomes are
     possible usingless water.
      Provincial officials are reluctant to raise irrigation water tariffs to levels approved
      by the central government and agreedwiththe Bank.
      The linkbetweenwater resource conservation and its economic pricing does not
      appear to have taken root inWestern China. Despite the ideas introducedby the
      Bankthe Chinese continue to rely onthe administration, notthe market, to allocate
      water.
      While manyWUAs and SIDDs were formed and the idea o f self-reliance and self-
      financing i s strongly emphasized by Chinese officials, inpractice many WUAs and
      SIDDsarejust extensions ("paper WAS")ofthe top-down state administration
      designedto meet imposedtargets.
   0  Operation and maintenance o f irrigation infrastructure will mostly rely on state
      subsidies becauseo f anunwillingnessto charge for water. Consequently SIDDs do
      not appear to be viable.
      As withthe other projects, greater care is neededto the design, implementationand
      applicationo f M&E. Local capacity-building i s needed. The results chain for
      achievement o fproject objectives needs to be carefully thought through. Ifthis had
      beendone it is unlikelythat the climatic element would have beenoverlooked.

3. OVERALLFINDINGSAND CHALLENGESLOOKING
    FORWARD

FINDINGS

3.1     Overview. The three projects provide a great range o fexperience covering more
than ten years o fwater planning and development inChina. The objectives o fthese
prominent projects were key to the sustainable development o f China's land and water
resources and have providedinsight into what works well andthe remainingchallenges.
The overall impression is that China is superlatively good at constructing highquality
infrastructure on time and generally within budgetbut i s less good at reforming its way o f
doing business or developing new institutions.

3.2     Strongin-countrypresencematters.The mutualtrust and shared responsibility in
the implementationand supervision ofthe projects was possible throughthe maintenance
o f a consistent Bank task teams throughout implementation. The fact that the projects were
task-managed from the field office facilitated Bank-Borrower cooperation andpartnership.

3.3     Key elements o f successrequire active Bankengagement over the long term and
consistent promotion o f sustainable landpolicy and management practices. However, when
projects are replicated indifferent areas care has to be taken that institutional assessment i s
not basedon unfounded prior assumptions or higher level agreements. It i s notable below
the central andprovincial level inChinathat locallevel institutionalcapacity and
knowledge o f current best practice and i s very uneven.

3.4     Chinabenefitedsubstantiallyfrom the Bank's insistenceon applicationof its
procurementand safeguard policiesand contractingprocedures. Staff ofthe central
government, its agencies and provincial governments were unanimous inthe view that this
greatly improvedChinese institutions, buildingsignificant human capital and making them
internationally more competitive. Inthe Tarim Basinand at Xiaolangdi projects, in
particular, improvedprocurement significantly lowered costs, as did introduction o f
standard dispute resolution systems.

3.5     China's resource mobilizationwas problematic.At the provincial levelresource
mobilization was problematic, widespread and created delays inorderly implementation.
While the principle o fdevolving financial responsibilityto the lowest levels o f government
are laudable they pose particularly difficult coordinationproblems for projects that cover
severaljurisdictions.

3.6      Adjustment to the market-economyis slow -particularlyfor large
infrastructure.Thereremains a willingnessto subsidize development evenwhenthis has
strong private goods characteristics. The Bank expected beneficiaries to pay economic
prices or at least the cost for the private goods generatedby public investmentinall four
projects andthis was part o fthe project design. Despite this, central and provincial
authorities were unwilling to raise water and power tariffs to agreed levels for major
infrastructure. Conversely much smaller development was frustrated by the lack o f resolve

                                                69


and/or ability to discriminate betweenpublic and private goods. Sometimes this created
bottlenecks - for example inthe Loess Plateau many small dams that had significant down
stream public benefits were cancelled because governorates only viewed the structure as
providing local private benefits (inthis case newlycreated warping land and water
storage.)

3.7     Integrated river basin planning has been piloted successfully but more needs to
be done. The TarimBasinproject was the first successful attempt inChina at
implementingintegrated river basindevelopment andmanagement. Itis notable for the
inclusiono f environmental improvement withinits primary objectives. And unlike other
riverbasin organizations inChina it is the first to promote andnurture strong links between
the riverbasinmanagement agency, localpolitical stakeholders at prefectural and county
level and farmer beneficiaries. As inseveral other Bank-supported projects inChina it has
emphasized creation o f financially self-sufficient water user associations. But as with those
projects, the government sends mixedsignals on cost-recovery and at the prefectural and
county levels welfare consideration continue to outweigh financial prudence.

3.8      Thereis a lack of political resolveto reducewater consumptionthrough new
institutions. The absence of strict enforcement o fthe water quota systemor realistic water
pricing i s a major issue that could, inthe mediumto long-term, jeopardize project
achievements. Undervaluedwater resources are may be misallocated. The larger issue o f
maximizingthe value-added from water development has not beenaddressed. The current
quota system by administrative allocation takes no account o fthe economic value o fwater
or its opportunity cost incurrent uses. New mechanisms needto be agreed to develop
criteria to allocate water efficiently.

3.9      Monitoring and Evaluation requires capacity building and reorientation to
measureoutcomes and impacts.M&Ewas problematic for all four projects evenwhenit
appearedto be carefully planned at appraisal. While all projects excelled inmeasuring
process and physical indicators, most had difficult i s establishing robust systems to
measure socio-economic impacts and interpret the findings. The major difficulty was that
most o fthe implementingagencieswere engineering-focused and delegated non-
engineeringM&Eto external agencies o fvarying capability and experience.

CHALLENGES       LOOKINGFORWARD

3.10     The overall conclusion from this project performance assessmentis that while the
Government o f China has promotedwater use efficiency through individual projects there
i s very little political will inthe provinces and below to make the hard institutional choices
thiswould involve. Respondingto these constraints the government has continued to
facilitate high level thinkingand policy debate on national water policy and modify the
governance framework from time-to-time.

3.11     To provide a firm base for comprehensive management o f China's land and water
resourcesthe government initiateda long series o f laws, rules and regulations startingin
the 1980s.Initially these laws were reactive and aimed at addressing specific problems in
water pollution, soil conservation, flood control, water management, environmental
protectionand land administration. Later laws and regulations have tendedto strengthen

                                                   70



the increasingly holistic approach to water management although the pathhas beendifficult
to navigate. The major difficulty has beenmodifying China's supply-drivenwater system,
a legacy o fthe earlier planned economy, and harnessing the more recent demand-driven
exploitation to create a law-based, economically efficient, and ecologically-sound water
management regime.' lo

Enabling environmentalmanagementthrough laws and regulations

3.12     Institutions to guide water planning, allocation, licensing, withdrawal permits,
compensation, and construction, and consultation procedures for water disputes, were
created by the 1988 Water Law. This Law provided the first comprehensive set o f
principles to manage water inChina and i s the fundamental "umbrella" law for water
management. Water use for domestic consumers was givenpriority as was balancing
utilization against potentially harmful externalities. Water and flood management were
unifiedunderthe MinistryofWater Resources and multipurpose water for use was
highlighted.l1

3.13     SubsequentlyMWR's responsibility for watershed and landmanagement was
formalized through the 1991 Water and Soil Conservation Law. This focused onprotection
o f soil and water loss as the first priority o f conservation work, giving emphasis to
aforestation and ecologicall-sound forest management, prohibition o f cultivation on steep
slopes, and restoration o fvegetative cover after completion o f infrastructure projects.
Specific policies to cope with soil and water loss inmountainous and hilly areas include
integrated regulationandmanagement, establishment o f a contract system for regulation
and management o f small catchments insoil eroded areas, and establishment o fmarket-
oriented mechanisms for soil and water conservation. Although this ledto the development
o f plansand local level regulations for fee collection to cover the cost o f erosion control
facilities, lack o f funds at the local level seriously constrained its implementation and
enforcement. The Bank's Loess Plateau and earlier RedSoils projects alleviated these
constraints locally.

3.14     Furtheremphasison ariver basin approach inthe preparation o fflood controlplans
and coordinationwith land-use plans developed by provinces and municipalities was
authorized through the 1997 Law o f Flood Control. Although local interests were supposed
to take a subordinate role inthe planning, the responsibility for flood fighting and relief
was placedwith them following policies and management rules developed incoordination
withthe river basin authority. Conflict resolutionwas to be throughnegotiation, with
higher-levelgovernment -the MWR having final authority. Overall environmental
safeguards were formalized through the 1989 Environmental ProtectionLaw that gave the
State Environment Protection Administration (SEPA) the authority to coordinate and
manage environmental protection. While SEPA hadthe overall responsibility for water

International. Volume 26, Number 3, Pages335-341, September2001.
111. The 1988 Water Law built on the 1984 Water Pollution Control Law (the first law for water and
pollution management in China) and covered the integrated use o f surface and groundwater, provision of
water for environmental management and water conservation.

                                               71


quality and pollution issues, the MWRretained the authority to supervise and manage
protectiono fwater resources, thus creating overlap o fjurisdiction insome areas.

3.15    Inpractice these lawsproveddifficult to apply for anumberofreasons. First,water
resources and pollutionmanagement are primarily the responsibility o fprovincial
authorities. Secondis that, while the central water and environmental agencies retained
technical control over river basins, there was no single administrative authority looking
after the spatial accountability from one province to the next within a single river basin-
the TarimBasinbeingthe single exception. Third, as already noted, some provinces
withdrewmorethentheir allocation. Onthe Yellow Riverthe periods o fno flow inthe
lower reaches reached crisis proportions inthe late 1990sand only then did government
react.

3.16    The drying-up attracted national and international attention that ledto anappeal
signed by 138 academicians o fChinaAcademy o f Science and ChinaAcademy o f
Engineeringto plead for "Acting Together and Saving the Yellow River. " This group
subsequentlyundertook its own investigationthat covered mucho fthe river basin. At the
same time the China Central Television and Economic NewsDaily co-organized a media
campaign named "LongMarch Exploration to the Cause of Yellow River Dry Up" that
heightenedpublic awareness.As a result, following approval ofthe State Council, the State
Development and Planning Committee and MWRjointly issued the Yellow River Water
RegulationManagement Regulation Stipulation inDecember o f 1998.'l2The beneficial
effects o fthis on operations at Xiaolangdi have been discussed earlier, as was the way
provincial politicians were able to bypass the regulation when it did not serve their
purposes.

Overlap and ConflictingResponsibilitiesfor Water FrustrateReformProgress

3.17    The single biggestproblem is that a large number o forganizations and authorities
have administrative, technical or defacto responsibility for parts or facets o f a unitary
resource - water. Inmany instances the ultimate authority i s unclear because o f overlapping
jurisdictions or lack o f clarity inthe enabling laws and regulations. Often key stakeholders
are not representedor informed. Evenwhenjurisdictional authority i s clear at the
provincial level and below, the ability to effectively manage i s fi-ustrated by inadequate
information or the unwillingnesso f local governments to cooperate on "common good"
issues becausethey may hinder local economic development.

3.18    Tencentral ministries and agencies have overlappingresponsibility for various
aspects o fwater resources and service management and administration. The MWR i s the
lead agency that delegates water resources management and planningto the nine River
Basin Commissions that, inprinciple, helpresolve conflicts betweenjurisdictions and
sectors and ensure that multipleuses are inaccord with establishedpriorities. They have
two important constraints. First, the Commission's authority applies only to inter-
provincial waters. Second-with the sole exception o fthe Tarim Basin-they are not

accountable to, nor have any representatives from, the provincial governments or lower
levels o f administration. Centrally-funded projects are supervisedby the MWR's Provincial
Water Bureaux implementand supervise below this level, their Water Affairs Bureaux
manage local level water resources strategy, including water quantity and quality, provide
integrated management for city and country water services and pollution management. The
arrangementsfor continuity o f water and landpolicy from the centre to the local level are
admirable but it has a serious flaw that creates local conflicts o f interest. The Bureaux
report and depend upon fundingfrom provincial governments whose jurisdictions are
unrelatedto hydrological boundaries. More critically, staff o fthese agencies are employees
o fthe provincial or country government, not the MWR.

3.19    Control o fthe water resource base and degradation o f it by pollution i s critical to
maintainutilizable supplies. Yet overlapping responsibility frequently fi-ustrates this
objective. Pollutionreductiontargets are based on a basinpollution planprepared by SEPA
who implementthem through their Provincial Environmental Protection Bureaux (EPBs) at
their various EnvironmentalMonitoring Stations. However, their responsibilitiesfor quality
issues and planningoverlap the mandate givento MWA's Water Affairs Bureaux
particularly for urban areas. As with water quantity, management o fwater pollution also
has conflicts o f interest -EPBs are subsidized with income from wastewater pollution
charges and fees -as local governments may put a higher priority on unrestricted industrial
and urban development following implementationo fthe regional and governor's
responsibility system. Thus local enforcement i s weak.

3.20    Overall coordination at the apex i s also weak. While the governing laws intended
close cooperation betweenMWR and SEPA both ministriestendto work separately and
submit separate andoften conflicting water management plans to the State Council. Inpart
this is becausetheir basic water planningcriteria, data and assessmentareas are neither
harmonized nor compatible.' l3 Central Committee did institute a national leading
                                 The
group for Water Resources and Soil Conservation in 1988 to improve inter-ministerial and
departmental coordination and similar leading groups at lower government levels.
However, this lost highlevel support inthe 1990s and disappeared inthe 1998 reform o f
government's organizations. The only residual i s the State Flood and Drought Control
ReliefHeadquarters. Currently, provinces feel squeezedbetweenMWRand SEPA and
would preferto align themselves with a unifiedbasin organization to ensure consistent and
equitable treatment and better integrationo f water quality and quantity management. l4  '
Government response to coordination and management issues is slow

3.21    Responding to these problems, the Water Law was revisedin2002 to provide a
more comprehensive planning and management framework for China's river basins. It
endorsedthe twin principles o ftotal quantity control and quota management; reinforcedthe
concepts o fpermits for water users and fees for supply, and reemphasized the importance
o f improvements inwater use efficiency. The legislation also set downthe principles o f

water pricing reform, including the concept o f reasonable return, equitable sharingo f costs
andthe principles of compensation andprice relatedto water quality. For the first time
water markets were included among economic instruments as was the principle that the
"polluters pays."

3.22    However, the revisedlaw makes no provision inthe RiverBasin Commissions for
the representatives o flocal stakeholders at the provincial and municipal levels andtakes no
account on inter-provincial riverbasin agreements with concerned governments.' l5No
attempt was made to mainstream the Bank-assisted experiments on broader participationin
the Tarim RiverBasinbecauseit was too earlyto do so. Indeed, inhindsightitappearsthat
the newresolve impartedbythe 2002 law may have beenthe reasonthat the government of
Xinjiang Province revitalized implementationo f institutionalreform which had been
problematic untilthen. But four years later the unclear relationship betweenriverbasin
commissions and local governments still hinders dispute resolution.' l6More importantly,
the revisedlaw didnot clarify or redefinethe roles o fthe national levelwater and
environmental organizations that had overlapping responsibility for managingthis
increasingly scarce resource.

3.23    The devastating floods onthe River Yangtze in2002 refocused the government on
the consequences o fpoor coordinationamong the multitudeo f organizations that hadmade
environmentally sound river basinmanagement elusive. Inresponse the government set up
a Task Force on Integrated RiverBasinManagement (IRBM)in2003 to help it redress
these problems.' l7The objectives o fthe IRBMTask Force were to (1) assess existing laws
andregulations andmakerecommendations to state legislationauthorities; (2) review
existingriver basin management practices, assessthe coordinationo f existingriver basin
management, andmake recommendations to the State Government and river basin
commissions at the national level, on the Yangtze RiverBasin inparticular; (3) promote
relevant economic tools such as water rights, water pricing, subsidies, compensation,
tradable permits, and greentaxation for integrated water resources management at the
national level and inthe Yangtze River; (4) promote stakeholder participationand
community involvement; (4) provide a platform for information sharing; and (5) establish
and promote communicationtools including workshops and publications.

level IBRMcommission involving the National DevelopmentReform Commission, MWR
and SEPA that would coordinate policy andplanning, establish standards andtargets and
resolve conflicts. 11* Practically it proposed that IRBMprinciples should be piloted intwo
priority tributaries o fthe Yangtze RiverBasinto rationalize existing laws to reduce
contradictions that hinder institutionalreform, and that subsequentlyMaster Plans for each
major river basinshould be undertaken. The Task Force reaffirmedthe importance of the
newdirection o fthe 2002 Water Law emphasizing mechanisms to enable open and free
access to development planningproposals, economic and incentive measuresthat include
social and economic costs, and including the value o f ecosystem services including
`environmental pricing. Importantly, it called for examinationo fwater pricing as a
perverse subsidy usingcase studies.

3.25     In2003 theNDRC andMWRjointly issuedregulations to increasewater prices for
industryandwater supplies and, to a lesser extent, those for agriculture. The "Outline o f
theNational Water Saving Plan" was endorsed by the Ministryof Constructionthat stated
that all new andreconstructed buildingwould be requiredto install water-saving devices by
2010 and that excessive consumers o fwater would be subject to higherwater tariffs."'              The
longer-term objective by 2010 i s to supply through water saving halfthe incremental
industrial demand and most o fthe incremental demand inirrigation. The water-saving plan
was officially released inFebruary 2O07.l2OHow far this plantook account o f the CCICED
recommendations i s unclear but it clearly resonateswith them and i s inharmony on many
issues.

China Moves toward a Water-Saving Society, Slowly

3.26     As indicated, Chinahas increasingly emphasized the imperativeto move towards
greater and more efficient water use. To this end the MWRstarted implementingwater
saving pilots over the period 2001 to 2010 to determine best practice. The first phase
focused on areas with serious water shortage and water pollution problems suitable for the
demonstrative purpose. The secondphase will establish water conservation demonstrative
areas inselectedprovinces and river basins. According to MWRbetween 1998 and 2004
US$2 billionwas allocated by central government for physicalmodernization and
rehabilitationo f large-scale irrigation systems and since then annual investmenthas risen to
about US$1.5 billion.121

3.27     Usingpricingto induce conservation has beenonly modestly effective. As this
assessmentshows this i s mainly due to lack o f enforcement at provincial level. Even
thoughthe MWR and Ministry of Finance issued guidelines in 1988 that requiredwater
institutionsto become financially autonomous by raising water fees over the next 5-10
years to recover all costs, they never approached full cost recovery.122 The Xiaolangdi
experience i s a prime example. Nationally average tariffs for water supply increased from

0.028 Yuan per cubic meter in2000 to 0.06 Yuan per cubic meter in2005. A major
constraint inthe agricultural sector i s that water charges are frequently included within
local landand agricultural taxes and there i s no direct connectionbetweenwater fees,
quality o f service andwater use. Thus there are few incentives for farmers to conserve
water.'23, 124 Among the more positive signsthat things are changing there are now over
20,000 water user associations that are co-managing irrigation water at the local level.
However, as this evaluation and other assessmentshave shown, the role and effectiveness
o f WUAs i s very uneven125

3.28      Evenso, the researchby Wang and others showed that the mere fact o f shifting
management from the collective to either a WUA systemor contracting didnot lead to
water savings unless managers were givenpositive incentives. Whenthere were incentives
water use per hectare was reduced by about 40 percent.'26 The incentives apparently also
improvedthe efficiency of the irrigation systems: there was no change inthe output o f
major crops, such as rice and maize, andrural incomes and poverty remained statistically
unchanged. Conversely, water reform ledto a decline inwheat production because it
dependedmainly on irrigation. Ona larger scale this would significantly challenge China's
foodgrain self-sufficiency policy -a constraint that could be relievedby importing
wheat.'27

An IncreasedFocus on Water Savings

3.29      Untilthe mid-1990sthe primaryobjective was to improvethe irrigationefficiency
o fmajor physical infrastructure usingwell-triedmethods including canal lining and better
water control and scheduling that now cover a third o f all irrigation. Water saved was
typically usedto extendthe area or intensity o f irrigation. Subsequently, muchmore
attention i s now paid to water saving technology. Nationally 10percent i s equi edwith
low pressure pipes and 6 percent with sprinkler, drip or other micro-irrigation.                Rf:

3.30      Improved agronomic and land management practices have also ledto water saving
on over 3.5 millionha of rice fields.129Aerobic rice, for example, i s now grown on 140,000

technologies andmechanization''.         Water use was about 60 percent less than that o f
traditional lowlandrice grown instandingwater, total water productivity 1.6 to 1.9 times
higher, andnet returns to water use 2 times higher.13'Use o fplastic tunnels, dry-tillage,
and greenhouses has grown five-fold since 1995 to over 2.5 million ha in2004.132,133

3.3 1   Therecently completed Bank-assisted Water Conservation Project innorth-eastern
China was highly successful indemonstrating that water consumptioncan be reduced while
farmer's income increased.134 It also showed that workable institutional arrangements can
be implementedto reduce the longterm depletiono fgroundwater resources. It successfully
and explicitly mainstreamed the concept o f increasing value-added per unit o f
evapotranspiration. This shiftedan earlier Bank focus away from promoting only crop
diversification to promoting improved cropping, agronomy andthe volumetric
measurement o f water use. Generally, higher incrementalincomes were achieved with the
more advanced irrigation applicationtechnologies.

3.32     The lessonsonhow to conserve water utilized for agricultural productionare being
scaled-up incentral government programs: the National Water Conservation Program
financed by the Ministry o fFinance's State Office for Comprehensive Agriculture
Development and the National Irrigated Agriculture Water Saving Program by the Ministry
o f Water Resources. Local government programs for water conservation have been also
initiatedfollowing the precedent set by the project. For example, the preparation o f
county-level groundwater management plans, piloted infour counties underthe project, has
beentaken upby a further 21 counties acrossNorthern China. Prosperous urbanareas (e.g.
Beijing and Qingdao) are also planning to invest both inwater saving, with aview to urban
water supply, and inthe "harmonious society" approach to balancingrural and urban
development and incomes.

3.33     The more liberal Chinese approach has allowed provinces andtownships to
experiment with innovative ways o fmanaging water particularly inthose provinces where
internal demand exceeds the quota. Successful innovations are endorsed by the MWR (Box
 1) butthey are not mainstreamed nationally innewpolicy initiatives.

rightshad avalue and set up official procedures for approval andthe determination o fthe
price of water rightstransfer.'36Precedingthe rights transfer inthe Yellow RiverBasin, the
first water trade took place inZhenjiangProvince inthe southern part o f the Yangtze River
delta.'37These trades also highlightthe fact that the highwater usage o fthese industrial
facilities- a result of outdated technologies -offers a second opportunity to reduce water
consumption once new standards are established and regulated. This i s true o f other sectors
too (Table 14).

Improvedlandmanagementhas been successful-but sustainable?

3.35       Since the 1970s the objective o f landmanagement has changed from a primarily
productive focus to one inwhich it i s recognized that they also provide environmental
services -particularly for water management and reduction o f desertification. According to
MWR, bythe end o f2005 almost one millionha o ferosion mitigation hadbeen
implementedincluding 0.4 millionha ofwatershed improvementand 0.6 millionha o f

ecological restoration. 138 But MWR i s now a small player because o f the large areas o f
steeply sloping land afforested under Sloping Land ConversionProgramthat i s designedto
convert 14.67 millionhectares o f cropland (including a target o f afforesting4.4 million ha
o f land with gradients o f more than 25 degrees) in23 provinces to forest by 2010 and has
an overall budget o fmore than US$40 billion. Inaddition, it had a soft goal o f afforesting
an equivalent area o fwasteland. By 2004 SLCP had converted 7.2 million ha o f cropland
and afforested 4.9 millionha o f~aste1and.l~'Ifsuccessful these programs are likely to
have a very positive impact on China's landscape, natural environment and water resources.

3.36     Independentreviewso fthe implementationexperience, however, have raised a
number ofissues affectingthe sustainability o fSLCP. There is also aneedto fine-tune the
environmental objectives to the differing regional climates -plantingtrees rather then grass
inLoess Plateauregionmay beefficient for carbon sequestrationbutmay not bethe best
option considering water resource shortages.140Coordination betweenthe State Forest
Administration and MWR on watershed management i s problematic. Although the subsidy
i s directly financed by the central government, not all village, township and county
governments are ina position to finance local costs (i.e. mediationbetweencentral
agencies and farmers, inspections) particularly as productionbenefits on converted land are
free o f all taxes -this could be an issue giventhat the overall survival rate o f trees i s about
75 percent, and perhaps on1 70 percent inthe Yellow RiverBasin. Fieldevidence
indicates it may be lower.147

3.37     There are also concerns that short-term subsidiesmay not cover lost income in
some areas while converted lands mature and yield returns. And about a third o f farmers
have indicated that shouldthe subsidies cease they will take back the land into
c~ltivation.'~~One way o f mitigating this risk would be to increase off-farm rural
employment as it would reduce the pressure on fragile land resources. Additionally, there
have beenreports that local governments are taking their costs from the subsidy, thus
reducing incentives for farmers to participate. Farmersare reportedly also showing an
increasing reluctance to "voluntarily" convert adjacent barrenlands (that are sometimes the
worst eroded) because o f the highlabor requirement.Evenso, independentfield surveys
found that highly sloping and low-quality landwas beingpredominantly targeted.
Conversely, there i s a concern that disbursementpressures have ledto the inclusion o f land
that should not be targeted, thus lowering program efficiency and increasing costs.

3.38   Finally, there i s negligible monitoring and evaluation to measure and link the
environmental benefits o fthe program to erosion control, sedimentation and water
resources. This i s perhaps a casualty o fthe absence o fthe MWR from the SLCP program

Progresson essential reforms is beingoutpaced by growingwater demand

3.39    As a result ofthe rapidpace o furbanizationinChina, urbanand industrial water
demandhas steadily grown at 5 percent since the 1980s and is projected to a~ce1erate.l~~
The driving force will be the more than doubling o furbanpopulations from 118 millionto
about 260 millionbetween2002 and 2020. Income growth inboth rural and urban areas
increasedper capita water consumption by more than a thirdover the period 1989-1997
and this i s likely to continue. Overall water demand inthe most water short areas o fNorth
China inthe area covered by the Yellow (Huang), Hai and Huai river basins -the 3-H
basins -will depend much uponthe growth o f GDP. As the recent GDP growth rates have
exceededthe "high" scenario o f 8.5 percent envisaged by the investmentplanning studies
and their 2002 updates (para 1.33), it i s projected that total water demandwill increase
from an average o f 150billion cubic meters a year (bcm/year) in2000 to about 173
bcm/year in2020. Invery dry years this could exceed 210bcm/year. Against these
demands the total water supplywill be 144bcm/year, o fwhich 73 percent will come from
surface water.

3.40    The huge shortfall insupply is very significant as it will affect economic activity
and the lives o f 324 millionpeople in 100major cities withintwelve Northern province^.'^^
Giventhat urban, industrial and domestic water supply are accorded ahigherpriority for
water inthe nationalpolicy the agricultural sector will contract unless it can use water far
more efficiently than at present.This will be difficult. Accordingly, it i s projectedthat
because as much as 6 bcm/year o f water could be shiftedout o f agriculture, the area o f
cropped land could contract by about 4.2 millionha. The overall impact o f water shortages
inall sectors isprojected by 2020 to have anannual economic cost ofbetweenY 44 billion
(US$5.4 billion) andY 70billion(US$ 8.5 billion.) These potentiallossescanbepartially
alleviated by increasing water use efficiency, reuse o f and importing water. Inaddition to
engineeringmeasures, water pricing would catalyze moves towards greater water use
efficiency and reuse.

3.41    China has clearly chosen supply augmentation via the inter-basin South-North
Water Transfer Scheme as the most obvious solution. Inpart this i s because it provides a
guaranteed supply and the engineeringrequired, though expensive, i s well known, feasible
and practical giventhe highquality o f China's organizational and engineeringskills
demonstrated inthe assessedprojects. Intests o fthe various policy options it was found

that an overall increase inwater use efficiency o f 10percent would reduce economic losses
in2020 byabout US$ 1billionayear. Includingreuse andthe fullimpact o fwater price
increase would leadto overall reductions o f about US$3.5 billion a year. The reduction o f
economic losses causedby the South- Northtransfer alone would be less, about US$3.1
billion a year. Obviously the water use option would not be cost free but it would be highly
disaggregated and easy to implementas the intra-provincial water rightstransfer
demonstrated. The only problem withthe institutional solutions i s the lack or resolve and
uncertainty about how quickly it could make a difference.

CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS

3.42    Duringthe Xiaolangdi andTarimBasinProjectsthe Bankwas able to work with
national-level organizations o f water policy issues giventhe cross-cutting nature o fthese
enterprises. For the first and only time the Bank was inthe privilegedposition o f assisting
MWR with the integrated planning ofthe Yellow RiverandTarimRiverBasins. This was
importantbecausethe incremental impact o fthe projects the Bank supported on water
resourcesmanagement could be modeledat the river basin scale andfully integrated with
China's large portfolio o fpotentialprojects. Inboth cases, this approach indicatedthat the
Bank- assistedprojects were better than project alternatives that were thus rejected. And in
both cases the Bank-assisted projects put a large emphasis on saving water ina river basin
context.

3.43    Reviewingthe post-1990 portfolio o fagriculturalwater projects supported bythe
BankinNorthandWest Chinathere hasbeena clear trendfrom buildingnewirrigation
that increasesbasin-wide water demand, to projects that seek to improve water use
efficiency and conservation efforts. However, there have beensome strategic mistakes that
should have beenavoided -the Guanghong IrrigationProject approved in 1999 effectively
doubled water use for irrigation inthe mid-reaches o fthe Yellow River near Xian. At the
same time the downstream Water Conservation Project approved in2001 was extremely
effective inreducing overall water consumption and i s a prime example o fwhat the Bank
should support.

There are three lessons:

        The Bankneedsto elevateitsengagement in China's water resources policy
        discussions above the provinciallevelto emphasizethe perverseincentivesthat
        are created by extensive agricultural water subsidies. Subsidiesfor irrigation
        and landmanagementjeopardize water conservation effort, longer term
        sustainability o f irrigation and landreclamationprojects and water availability for
        towns, cities, industryand environmental management. Despite more than two
        decades o fBank partnership and several state-of-the art projects piloting new
        approachesthese tendto be enclave projects. While Chinese senior planners and
        politicians at the center acknowledge that pricing should play a role inensuring
        more efficient and rational allocation anduse o f water this i s still as at an early
        stage o f applicationand far from politically acceptable inthe provinces. Without
        such a change inthe near future water shortages and environmental consequences
        o fresource mismanagement will continue to grow to crisis proportions;

0Monitoring and Evaluation requires capacity building and reorientation to
 measureoutcomes and impacts.There is little virtue inimplementing
  development models for reclaiming degraded lands or for river basin management if
  impacts on welfare, incomes andthe economy cannot be accurately measured.
  While this is less o f a problem for physical achievements it is a major problem for
  measurement o f socio-economic outcomes and impacts. Muchmore attention has to
  be givento understandingthe appropriate counterfactual and ensuringunbiased
  sampling. There i s also an issue around selection o fthe most effective M&Emodel
  considering the outcomes expected and the cost o f the projects. Appropriate training
  to redressthe problems found inM&Ei s clearly indicated. Inaddition, more
  attention should be givento fully utilizing existing Chinese resources. The Ministry
  o f Finance has indicatedthat it has a national network o f monitoring that include
  socio-economic indicators and that consideration should be givento working with
  themto triangulate evaluative findings; and

0 Muchgreater care is required in dealingwith issues of attribution when
  estimatingex-post economic rates of return. Specifically this means clearer
  definition o fthe project counterfactual and a systematic accounting o fthe effects o f
  exogenous actors and investmenton project impact. Without such attention to these
  exogenous factors there i s a danger that estimated ERRSgive a false impression o f
  project impacts. This, inturn, may leadto incorrect lessons on development
  effectiveness and the efficacy o fpolicy, institutionaland engineeringmeasures
  utilized to achieve development objectives.
