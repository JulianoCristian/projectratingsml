3)\n            minimize environmental degradation as a result of either\n            individual subprojects or their cumulative effects; and 4)\n            protect human health.  The project is anticipated to have\n            minor and localized environmental impacts coming mainly from\n            civil works activities related to the construction of\n            cyclone-resistant housing units and retrofitting of\n            partially damaged housing and buildings. The types of\n            environmental issues that may arise relate to land clearing\n            for site preparation, movement of workers, and materials to\n            and from project sites, and proper disposal of waste and\n            debris. The reconstruction of the housing units will take\n            place within the existing village boundaries and the units\n            are designed to be low-cost but cyclone resistant. They are\n            to be constructed mainly of legally imported timber and\n            materials, requiring only light civil works. Some\n            construction of the housing will occur in newly prepared\n            sites and will involve some clearance of bush and vegetation\n            for foundation preparation. Land has been identified and is\n            primarily a plantation land of mixed use."}, "docdt": "2012-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
