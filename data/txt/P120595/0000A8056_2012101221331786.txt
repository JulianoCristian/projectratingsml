                         Housing reconstruction, including water and sanitation facilities, is still behind schedule but has been making much better progress. The Ministry of Lands has received equipment
                         needed to help strengthen its disaster risk management capacity,and training of the Ministry's staff is progressing well, though some capacity building activities are still delayed.
