                         The Project Development Objective is to assist the Government of Tonga to implement its Niuatoputapu Priority Tsunami Recovery Program aimed at recovering the
                         living standards of the population living in the island affected by the tsunami of September 30, 2009, through the reconstruction of residential houses with auxiliary
                         infrastructure facilities in Niuatoputapu, and strengthening Tonga’s capacity to address future natural disasters.

                         Equipment, information, and training delivered by the project have improved Tonga’s capacity for risk identification, preparedness, and response. A policy framework for the
                         integration of risk information in land use planning has been developed and its use was piloted on Niuatoputapu. Signage identifying tsunami evacuation areas, escape routes and
                         safe areas has been installed on the island and the community disaster response arrangements have been tested through drills.

                         The Project Management Unit provided assistance in coordinating and facilitating the implementation of the Tsunami Recovery Program, including activities financed by the
                         Government of Tonga and other donors.
