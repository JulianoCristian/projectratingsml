moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            project implementation periods should allow for possible\n            delays. Even though land acquisition arrangements seemed\n            relatively straightforward at appraisal, unforeseen local\n            political issues that are common in a Pacific island context\n            stalled implementation of physical investments. Adequate\n            time should be allowed for land issues to be negotiated in\n            an appropriate way. Transport impediments (particularly\n            following a major natural disaster such as the 2009 Tsunami)\n            can delay travel of project staff to beneficiary communities\n            and can hold up implementation support missions. Capacity\n            building activities under component three were only loosely\n            linked to reconstruction and recovery activities under the\n            other components and were implemented by a different\n            ministry. Implementation delays resulted as (stretched)\n            project management staff concentrated their time and efforts\n            on facilitating physical investments that met urgent\n            recovery needs."}, "docdt": "2014-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
