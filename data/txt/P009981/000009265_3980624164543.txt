IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA
CEMENT INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
(Loan 3196-IN)
Preface
I.    This is the Implementation Completion Report for the Cement Industry Restructuring
Project in India, for which Loan 3196-IN in the amount of US$300 million equivalent was
approved on May 15,1990 and made effective on October 3, 1990.
2.    The loan was closed on June 30 1997, compared to the original closing date of June 30
1996. Final disbursement took place on December 1, 1997, at which time a balance of US$ 9.3
million was canceled besides earlier cancellations of US$6.82 million on June 1, 1994 and of
US$ 10 million on May 3, 1997 respectively. A distinctive feature of the loan was the
nomination of the financial intermedaries, IDBI and ICICI, two leading financial institutions in
India, to select and appraise the subprojects under criteria prescribed by the Bank. GOI onlent the
loan proceeds, except for US$2 million, to these institutions as rupee loans on commercial terms.
They, in turn, relent to participating cement companies the needed amounts in course of time, to
partly finance five large subprojects and three smaller subprojects on their usual commercial
terms.
3.    The ICR was prepared by a completion mission 1 that visited India in June-July 1997.
The aide-Memoire of the mission is reproduced as Appendix A. Materials in the project files and
the data and information on the subprojects that the beneficiaries furnished to the mission were
made use of in preparing the ICR. Special mention is also made of the statistical publications and
reviews that the Cement Manufacturers' Association of India made available to the mission
4.    The ICR was reviewed by Marilou Uy (Sector Manager), Private Sector Development
and Finance Group. The borrowers provided their own evaluation of the project's execution and
furnished other comments and these are included as Appendix B to the ICR.
1 Uruj Kirmani, Task Manager and P. Venugopal (Financial Consultant) comprised the mission.



CEMENT INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING PROJECT (Loan 3196-IN)
INDIA
Evaluation Summary
1.    Introduction. The Cement Industry in India had been under heavy control by the
Government of India (GOI) until 1982. These controls applied to capacities, prices, allocation of
sales quotas, nominations of buyers and many other elements. Under the circumstances, the
growth of the industry was severely constrained. The Bank had begun to work in the Indian
cement sector in 1980 with a sub-sector study (India-Cement Sector Report, No. 3141-IN). This
study contributed to the policy debate for partial decontrol of the industry in February 1982. The
Bank gave its support to the liberalization policies of GOI by providing two loans for the Cement
Industry Project (Lns. 2660/2661-IN) in March 1986. These loans became effective on
November 10, 1986 and closed on June 30, 1994. In March 1989, the Government removed the
price and distribution controls on cement completely. The Sustainability of liberalization and
further improvement of economic efficiency depended on the industry's ability to adjust, through
industrial restructuring, to the new and more competitive environment. This loan (Ln.3196-IN),
was provided to support GOI's policy decision of complete elimination of cement price and
distribution controls and assist the industry in adjusting to an increasing competitive
environment. This loan (In.3196-IN), was approved in May 1990 and became effective from
October 3, 1990. GOI onlent most of the proceeds of the loan (US$ 298 million out of total loan
US$ 300 million) to the financial intermediaries, i.e. the Industrial Development Bank of India
(IDBI) and the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India (ICICI) through a line of
credit, to provide sub-loans to cement companies in the private sector implementing the various
sub-projects for industrial modernization and restructuring. The remaining US$ 2 million were
managed directly by GOI to support Human Resources Development Component, TA and
Studies.
2.    Project Objectives.   All the objectives were well conceived and aimed at enabling the
industry itself of the opportunities available under a free market environment. The project was
designed to support the government's policy decision of complete elimination of cement price
and distribution controls already effected, and assist the industry in adjusting to an increasingly
competitive free market environment. It would enhance the industry's economic efficiency and
pave the way for sustained growth to meet increasing demand in the 1990s. Specifically, the
project was to:
* help to modernize and restructure a number of cement companies so that cost efficiencies
were achieved, capacities added, energy savings effected, environment improved by
reduction in emission of pollutants within limits, and alleviate cement supply deficiencies in
the northern and eastern regions in the country;
* introduce a bulk cement transportation scheme by financing a Bulk Cement Transport Pilot
Project to transport Bulk cement from Wadi (Andhra Pradesh) to Mumbai, which would
encourage use of bulk cement and ready mix concrete in construction industry;
* establish demand driven training system at Regional Training Centers (RTCs) and develop
training programs compatible with the modernization of the industry; and



* assist GOI in formulating their future strategy by providing six studies, focused on pollution
control, bulk cement marketing, coal washeries, use of lignite as fuel in the industry and
export of cement.
3.    Implementation Experience and Results. Achievement of objectives: The core
objective of fast and efficient growth through total deregulation of the cement industry has been
fully realized. Cement production from large cement plants which was 18 million tons in 1980
rose to 70 million tons in 1996-97. About 3 million tons were also exported in 1996-97. The
market determines the prices. Momentum has been generated for some of these companies and
others to expand capacities on their own.
4.    On the specific project components, the achievements were as follows:
(a)    Modernization and Restructuring: Five cement companies expanded their
capacities by adding new plants with state of the art technology, and served the deficient northern
and eastern regions of the country. They contributed 5.7 million tons out of the total increase of
8.5 million tons in annual consumption that had occurred in the six years ending 1996-97. Two
other cement plants also benefited under the loan in rehabilitating obsolescent machinery. All the
plants achieved energy efficiencies in conserving coal and electric power and the emission of
particulates were brought down even below the limits prescribed under India and Bank's
Environment control limits.
(b)    The Pilot Bulk Cement Transportation Component: The pilot plant was
successfully completed. The first dedicated train with Bulk Cement Wagons transported cement
from Wadi Plant to Mumbai terminal (a distance of about 300 miles) in October 1997.
(c)    Human Resource Development Component: Four Regional training Centers
(RTCs) were established and until June 30, 1997 over 3000 personnel were trained in these
RTCs. The training scheme was of great value to the industry and is being continued on a self-
financing basis.
(d)    Technical Assistance and Studies: Six studies were completed. with the
assistance of mostly local consultants. Recommendations pertained to the improvement of
productivity in mini-cement plants, washing coal to reduce ash content, using lignite in place of
coal in cement plants with access to lignite, exporting cement, introducing bulk cement transport
to Calcutta and Delhi and promoting use of bulk cement. The recommendations made in these
studies would greatly benefit GOI in formulating their future policies and the industry in applying
their results economically.
5.    Project Sustainability. India's per capita consumption of cement (of less than 100kg
per capita) is very low. The cement companies, especially those that are organized and managed
well, as the seven beneficiary companies, would have no difficulties in producing to full capacity
and marketing the product. The Bulk Cement transport pilot project will encourage use of bulk
cement and ready mix concrete, expand use of ready mix concrete in cement industry, and
improve the overall efficiency in transportation of cement. In view of the above, the project
sustainability is most likely.

6.    Project Costs, Financing and Timetable. Cost overruns were within 5% of detailed
appraisal estimates. The Bank financed through IDBI/ICICI about 40% of the total project costs
of US$ 698 million. The balance was met by domestic financing. A Danish Government grant
(DANIDA) of about US$ 6.5 million for the training scheme was utilized. It was supplemented
with the proceeds from the previous Cement Industry Project (Lns. 2660 and 2661) and this loan
(Ln.3 1 96-iN) for establishing four Regional Training Centers and impart focused training based
on well designed courses. In regard to project completion, all the major sub-projects were
completed in time. The implementation delays occurred in Bulk Cement Transport Pilot
Component. It was caused first, by delay in restructuring the Bulk Cement Corporation (BCC),
with the withdrawal of 3 out of 4 private sector stakeholders in BCC (para 7). These institutional
changes and downsizing of the project caused delay in the start of the construction which
commenced in October 1994. Later delays occurred partially due to force majeure (sev-ere
damage to wagons factory due to floods) and inefficient management of the supplies of bulk
cement wagons.
7.    Major Factors Affecting the Project. Major factors affecting the overall delay in
implementation of some project components are discussed as under:
(a)    TISCO sub-project encountered operational problems with the newly designed
rollers recommended by consultants for slag grinding. After making trial runs for several months
TISCO staff changed the design and manufactured new rollers locally. The purchase of the new
designed rollers in the first instance without a proven track record, proved to be expensive in the
long run.
(b)    Infrastructure deficiencies, such as unreliability of power supply, poor access
roads, shortages of rail wagons were vexatious, but the cement companies improvised various
solutions at high costs. For example, during project implementation, standby power plants were
installed at Maihar, Gujarat Ambuja and JK Corp. Ltd. sites to overcome power shortages.
(c)    Bulk Cement Transport Pilot Project: Implementation of this component was
delayed due to the following reasons: (i) Institutional: originally Bulk Cement Corporation
(BCC) was formed with 5 stakeholders. Four private sector companies and GOI, each had 20%
equity. The new institution suffered set back when 3 out of 4 private sector participants withdrew
from BCC necessitating its restructuring; (ii) Technical: The project was downsized and
redesigned to the revised program of sole private sector stakeholder ACC causing delay in project
implementation of this project; and (iii) Procurement: M/S CIMMCO, the supplier of Bulk
cement wagons, delayed delivery of Bulk Cement Wagons, resulting in delay in project
completion by one year.
8.    Although, all major sub-projects i.e. ACC Gagal, TISCO, Maihar, and LAXMI cement
were completed within the original closing date, BCC component necessitated extension of
closing date by one year.
9.    Bank and Borrower Performance. The Bank's performance, in first encouraging the
government to deregulate the industry, and then supporting the cement companies to adapt to a
free market economy was well conceived. In delegating to IDBI/ICICI - detailed appraisals, and
relending, the Bank provided transfer of technology and developed expertise within these
institutions for independent support to the industry in the future. The Bank involved IDBI/ICICI
in supervision missions, who focused at problem resolving on the spot as well as at the higher



- iv-
levels of the Government, where necessary. The Borrowers and the executing agencies, for their
part, different tiers of the ministries, the intermediary financial institutions and the cement
companies performed with a total commitment to results and success.
10.   Rating Project Outcome. The project is rated 'satisfactory'. The cement industry in
India has had a phenomenal growth with Bank support, and regional distribution has improved.
All project components were successfully implemented. This included the bulk cement
transportation component although delayed in completion.
11.   Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned. The planned
capacity, as enhanced by the companies in some cases after appraisal, would be reached in 2
years (84% already reached in 1996-97). The Bulk Cement Transport Pilot Project may need to
go through a 'Learning Curve'. Nevertheless, India will not lag behind developed countries in
adopting this mode of transportation. The cement sub-projects have attained or improved upon
the rated energy efficiencies and environmental standards. The momentum for growth of the
industry having been created and the industry having come of age in a competitive setting, the
Bank is unlikely to lend for a cement project again. But there is scope in an infrastructure
lending, for a segment targeted to the cement industry, such as for concrete highways.
12.   The lessons learnt were as follows:
l  A free market is a requisite for the rapid growth of an industry. In a developing country,
however, the government has to actively support the transition from a command economy to
a free economy.
*  To be competitive and efficient and to have staying power, the industry must possess and
continuously upgrade its technical and management skills and knowledge.
-  Any technology that is introduced in a developing country should have proven track record.
Initial price attractions of unproved technology could be ultimately detrimental.
- In planning projects, a holistic approach that should include what external agencies should
provide is necessary. Power, transportation, access roads and other items, in regard to their
availability and dependability have to be assessed and built in at the start.
*  In the present context of high interest rates on loans in India (far in excess of the inflation
rates), attention should be paid to the capital structure so that the debt to equity ratios are
carefully determnined at start of a project. The project costs could become high due to interest
during construction and delays in commissioning could have a deleterious effect on the
finances of a project.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA
CEMENT INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
(LOAN 3196-IN)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Background
1.    Over four to five decades until the beginning of 1982, the Cement Industry in India had been
under heavy control by the Government (GOI). The plant capacities and expansions were subject to
strict licensing, price controls were applied, quotas for sale through the government were enforced,
and measures for freight equalization over the country were adopted. The effect of these regulations
was, that growth of the industry was severely hampered. The Bank had begun to work in the Indian
Cement Sector in 1980 with a Sub-Sector Study. This study contributed to the policy debate for
partial decontrol of the industry in February 1982. To support the phased implementation of the
elimination of the cement pricing and distribution control, the Bank provided loans for the Cement
Industry Project (Lns. 2660/2661-fN) of US$ 200 million in November 1986. These loans became
effective on November 10, 1986 and closed on June 30, 1994.
2.    In March 1989, the Government removed all price and distribution controls on cement
completely, thereby eliminating all subsidies to the cement users in the public sector and all cross-
subsides to the cement users in the public sector, as well as all cross-subsidies relating to freight
equalization and differences in levy quotas among cement manufactures. The sustainability of
liberalization policies and further improvement of economic efficiency depended on the industry's
ability to adjust, through industrial restructuring, to the new and more competitive free market
environment. Restructuring would focus on some key elements, namely: (a) Regional production
capacity redistribution: Following the elimination of the freight equalization scheme, sharp regional
price differences developed between the cement-deficit north and east regions and cement-surplus
south and west regions. There was need for additional cement capacity in the northem and eastern
regions, which included some of the poorest areas of the country; (b) Modemization and Restructuring
of existing cement companies: The need for modemization came from strong competitive pressures
and the Govemment's commitment in enforcing pollution-control standards; (c) Introduction of bulk
cement transport systems; and (d) Establishing a manpower training system that was responsive to the
needs of substantial modemization and expansion in the cement industry.
3.    The Bank supported the Govemment in restructuring the sub-sector through this (Ln. 3196-
IN), which was approved in May 1990, and became effective on October 3, 1990. Out of US$ 300
million loan, US$ 298 million was provided to the industry through the development financial
intermediaries, the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) and the Industrial Credit and
Investment Corporation of India (ICICI) (50% each). Remaining US$ 2MM were managed by GOI in
financing Technical Assistance, Studies and Human Resources Development Component. The Bank
had initially identified a few sub-projects and had partially appraised them. Later IDBI and ICICI
selected and appraised other sub-projects. The Bank reviewed the appraisal by IDBI/ICICI and
environmental assessment report of each sub-project before agreeing to its financing through
IDBI/ICICI.

B. Statement /Evaluation of Objectives
4.    Succinctly stated, the project, in a resounding endorsement of the government's policy
decision of complete elimination of cement price and distribution controls already effected, would
assist the industry in adjusting to an increasingly competitive free market environment. The project
would enhance the industry's economic efficiency and pave the way for sustained growth to meet
increasing demand in the 1990s. Although not explicitly mentioned, the challenge was to demonstrate
that a market economy would produce wholesome results where a command economy had not
succeeded. The cement industry was the first one that GOI had chosen, to deregulate and the lessons
to be learnt were thus important. The Bank's support to the government in implementing the policv of
liberalization, and lending assistance to the cement companies to adjust to the free market conditions
in the short and the long term was appropriate.
5.    The assistance provided under various elements discussed below was comprehensive and well
chosen.
Part A: Industry Modernization and Restructuring: Modernization and restructuring with a
view to capacity expansion, reduction of cement deficit in some regions, cost efficiencies, improving
pollution control and promoting market competition;
Part B: Bulk Cement Transport Pilot Project Introduction of a pilot scheme for bulk
transportation of cement which would help establish a pilot bulk cement transport system including
loading facility at Wadi and unloading facility at Kalamboli (Mumbai). It will demonstrate the
potentials for productivity increases in large construction technology and encourage use of ready-mix
concrete (RMC), and provide efficient transportation of cement using Bulk Cement Wagons.
Part C: Human Resources Development Component: Support establishment of a demand-
driven training system and programs to develop skills, compatible with the significant transformation
of the cement industry, in 4 Regional Training Centers.
Part D: Technical Assistance and Studies: It included studies relating to policy and options in
six topics (i) Feasibility study for Coal Washeries; (ii) Use of lignite as fuel in cement industry; (iii)
Bulk cement transportation and the marketing of bulk cement; (iv) Study of Mini cement plants; (v)
Study of cement export opportunities; and (vi) Marketing of Bulk Cement.
C.    Achievement of Objectives
Core Objectives
6.    The core objective of fast and efficient growth of the cement industry has been fully realized.
Cement production from large cement plants which was 18 million tons in 1980 rose to 70 million
tons in 1996-97. About 3 million tons were also exported in 1996-97. Indian cement plants that have
been converted to the dry process and modernized with the state of the art technology. The market
determines the prices and these have been competitive, fair to the companies and considered
reasonable by the consumers. Momentum has also been generated for some of these companies, and
others to expand capacities on their own. The macroeconomic policy reforms in the cement industry
have set a model for deregulation of the other industries.
7.    Modernization and Restructuring. Five cement companies benefited under this project in that
they expanded their capacities by adding new plants with state-of-the-art technology, and served the
deficient northern and eastern regions of the country. Of the increase of 8.5 million tons in



-       -~~~3 -
consumption in the two regions as between 1990-91, the year of loan effectiveness and 1996-97, the
year of the original loan closing, these five plants contributed 5.7 million tons. Two other cement
plants also benefited under the loan in rehabilitating of obsolescent machinery. All the seven plants
achieved energy efficiencies of a high order in conserving coal and electric power, and made
significant reduction in cement production costs. Above all, particulate emissions was brought down
below the normal government approved limits through special designing of equipment and
accessories. This component absorbed 97% of the total project costs and 95% of the loan proceeds.
Full details of the individual sub-projects are given in Table 8a and the details are given in Appendix
C.
8.     Pilot Bulk Cement Transportation The Pilot Bulk Cement Transportation Component, in
relation to the modernization and restructuring component, was of a small magnitude, absorbing about
3% of the total project costs and 4% of the loan proceeds. The project has been commissioned fully in
October 1997. Bulk cement was transported from Wadi to Kalamboli (about 300 miles) terminal
using Bulk Cement Wagons. While implementation problems occurred, these have been resolved. No
risk is foreseen to proving that bulk transportation of cement in specially built rail wagons to a
metropolis like Mumbai, and use of cement in bulk would promote cost effectiveness, speed and
quality of construction and reduction in loss of cement. In fact central batching plants, that at present
have to receive cement in bags only, have started using bulk cement. Ready Mix Concrete (RMC)
plants are gaining popularity in India. To date 12 such plants have been established, including one
plant adjacent to the bulk cement terminal at Kalamboli (near Mumbai). BCC has, in fact sold over
2000 tons of Bulk Cement in its two months of operations. This is very encouraging as Bulk Cement
is becoming popular with the consumers much faster than anticipated. Additional details on the pilot
bulk transportation component are contained in Appendix D.
9.     Training system. Four Regional Training Centers (RTCs) were established for providing pre-
entry, entry and refresher courses, as well as special courses tailored to the needs of individual plants
from time to time. Financing to an extent of US$ 10 million was provided from this loan and the
earlier loans (Lns. 2660/2661-IN), including a grant (about US$ 6.5 million) from DANIDA of
Denmark 49 training packages (with 27 from overseas) were developed. By mid 1997, the RTCs
trained over 3000 personnel in 247 courses. The training scheme has proved of great value to the
industry and is being continued on a self-financing basis.
10.    Studies. The six studies were taken up and completed with the assistance of mostly local
consultants. Brief results of the studies are given as under:
(i) Mini cement plant study: The reasons for sickness were identified. Financial institutions
are being persuaded by the government to provide capital for reviving sick units, where justified.
(ii) Study on Coal washeries: Five central coal washeries (for reducing ash content of coal)
at identified locations of the coal belt are likely to be established. It will significantly improve
pollution control and energy efficiencies.
(iii) Study,for the use of Lignite as,fuel: Use of lignite in place of coal, in lignite abundant
areas, has been found feasible.
(iv) Study, for the Export of cement: Bottlenecks in export have been identified and are being
removed.
(v) Study, for the Bulk cement transportation in major cities of India: Locations for terminals
in Calcutta and Delhi, were identified. The Mumbai experience is being watched. The experience



-4 -
gained through Bulk Cement Transport Pilot at Mumbai will be helpful in designing of similar
facilities elsewhere.
(vi) Study for the development of market for bulk cement: The recomrnendations of this
study were publicized through the media including documentary films to promote use of bulk cement.
11.    The results achieved and recommendations made in these six studies would assist GOI in their
policy making for future growth of the cement sector, as well as benefit the lindustry at large for
application of the recommendations made therein.
Project Cost and Financial Objectives
12.    Project Costs: The sub-projects under all the components were estimated to cost US$ 669
million, after detailed appraisals, and involve ICB procedure purchases to a value of US$ 301 million.
The actual project costs are now placed at US$ 698 million of which US$ 292 million were utilized
for the ICB contracts. The closeness between the appraisal estimates and the actual costs and
financing are given in Tables 8a and 8b respectively.
13.    Financial / Economic Rate of Return: All large sub-projects were required to satisfy the
eligibility criteria (for sub-loans) of a minimum economic rate of return of 12% and a minimum
financial rate of return of 15%; all the participating companies should also have a debt/equity ratio
lower than 2.5/1. The composite ERR for the five large sub-projects, of the five cement companies
that expanded capacity, is now estimated at 21%; the composite FRR, at 16%. These are highly
satisfactory. Table 9 in Part II contains the estimates for the individual sub-projects. Fuller details are
included in Appendix C. The ERR for the pilot bulk cement transportation sub-project, although not a
major one, has also been estimated and the details are contained in Appendix D. It is estimated at
10.6% and is satisfactory.
14.    Social Objectives: The project had not explicitly addressed poverty alleviation and gender
concerns at the time it was prepared. Nevertheless, since cement plants are usually located at remote
areas, near sources of raw material like limestone, there is a boost to the local economy. The owners
of the cement plants have provided housing, health and educational facilities and given attention to
women's interests by establishing community centers for the development of skills, especially for
women living in the areas near the plant locations.
15.    Environment: The Project Agreement had laid down as a criterion that the sub-projects
should be designed and all equipment required thereunder be specified to meet the stricter of the
environmental protection standards applicable in India or acceptable to the Bank. Environmental
assessment was to be completed to Bank's satisfaction. Table 6 and Appendix C show that these
requirements have been satisfied. There is constant monitoring of the emissions and of ambient air
quality. The cement companies have also laid out extensive green belts and are otherwise sensitive to
environmental improvements.
D. Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project
16.   Implementation record: The overall record of implementation is satisfactory. All major
cement plants under the modernization and restructuring component were completed before the
original loan closing date of June 30, 1996. In fact, all the five major sub-projects for addition to
capacity/modernization went into commercial production in less than four years after IDBI/ICICI
approvals/loan effectiveness. Gujarat Ambuja and JK Corp took a few more months, but they
increased the planned capacity which involved some redesigning. The extension of the loan closing



-5 -
date by one year to June 30, 1997 was necessitated to accommodate a late start of the bulk cement
transportation sub-project and the delay in the delivery of the special wagons manufactured for bulk
cement. The major reason for the late start was institutional. 3 out of 4 cement companies who were
primary stakeholders pulled out from the new venture Bulk Cement Corporation (IBCC). They
became apprehensive of market inertia and resistance to switch from use of bagged cement to use of
bulk cement. One company (ACC), that is among the foremost in India in the cement industry, had no
such apprehension, and the government and IDBI/ICICI decided to cooperate with a minority share
holding in ajoint venture company (BCC) along with ACC as a major partner. The sub-project was
redesigned to a smaller scale. Later problems came up when delays occurred in the manufacture of
the special wagons in a factory in India due to both force-majeure (major floods at factory area
causing major damage), and conditions that apparently could have been controlled by the contractor.
But as stated in para. 8., rail transportation began in October 1997. The receiving terminal at Mumbai
had been completed months ago, and the bulk consuming market had been prepared to make use of
bulk cement. The spread of RMC batching plants (12 plants already working) indicate that bulk
cement will gain acceptance fast. The training component and the studies, it has been noted earlier
were completed with success within the original closing date.
17.   Factors Affecting Implementation: The following significant factors were noted during
implementation:
(a) ACC, one of the participating cement companies in modernization and restructuring, fully
prepaid the loans from IDBI/ICICI in May-August 1995, although it could have done so in quarterly
installments until 2001. It had derived the main advantages in the relent Bank part of the loans, first
buying foreign exchange for the imports and second, in the exemptions from import duties that the
government had extended to Bank financed projects - a substantial concession when import duties
were high.
(b) TISCO had technical problems with the rollers for slag grinding and had ultimately to
scrap the rollers recommended to it by consultants and design and manufacture rollers on its own
learning from the experience of the repeatedly failing rollers. To quote from their report - a key
lesson learnt was "The main technology for the project should be a proven one of its capacity in terms
of process and equipment." While this is true, there was not much experience around the world in the
use of High Pressure Grinding Rolls (HPGR) of the bandage type design. Their use was only recent
and the technology had not stabilized around the world. In particular, high duty performance of an
unprecedented scale in large volume grinding of slag was called for at the TISCO Plant. How far the
problems should have been anticipated by the technical consultants and the rollers design
differently/manufactured better, and valuable time saved in continuously finding solutions to the
difficulties and arose, and the modifications that had to be done are questions for careful study, but
beyond the ICR's purview. The consultants, as far as can be discerned, had acted and advised in good
faith.
(c) A common handicap that all the companies faced was power-availability and reliability.
In three sub-projects (Maihar Cement, Gujarat Ambuja and JK Corp.) standby power units were
installed. Other infrastructure deficiencies, such as lack of good access roads and wagons for transport
have been endemic. The cement companies had taken up these problems with the authorities and
gradually finding solutions. These deficiencies did not seriously affect project implementation, but
their removal in time would have enabled smoothness of operations.

E. Project Sustainability
18.   The consumption growth of cement is directlv related to GDP growth in the country. FY94,
FY95, and FY96 were years of buoyant economic growth and consumption of cement. There was a
slight cooling of the momentum in FY97, apparently temporary as revival signs have been noticed.
Consumption of cement per capita in the country, at less than 100 kg, is about 40% of the world
average. It would be realistic to expect all cement companies, not only to produce to full capacity, but
also to expand capacity. The beneficiary companies under Loan 3196-IN are leading companies with
long experience and reputation who would ride temporary troughs in the cement market as there may
be, and maintain a good long time record of performance and success. The bulk Cement
Transportation Component would be sustained with the support given by the major shareholder
(ACC), who has already set up a ready mix cement plant next to BCC's location at Kalamboli, as well
as by the good response received by BCC in the sale of Bulk Cement in Greater Mumbai area (over
10,000 tonnese bulk cement sold in 4 months). The training component has been successfully
completed, but the RTCs would continue to function, guided by a Coordination Council that the
government has set up in association with the cement companies. In sum, the project in all its
components is most likely to be sustained.
F. Bank Performance
19.   The most satisfying feature in this project was the coordination that the Bank achieved among
the different players, the Bank itself, the government in the Ministries of Finance (Department of
Economic Affairs) and Industry (Department of Industrial Policy and Coordination), IDBI/ICICI and
the participating cement companies. The Bank had a salutary effect on the evolution of the
liberalization of the cement industry, which became a harbinger for liberalization of other industries
that followed. The Bank had identified some major sub-projects, but it delegated to IDBI/ICICI
preparation and appraisal of the sub-projects (except the HRD and TA components that the
government retained for direct implementation). The Bank provided necessary guidance to all the
institutions. For supervisions, the Bank coopted the representatives of IDBI/ICICI in the missions.
Supervisions, at regular intervals with appropriate mix of skills, were aimed at identifying the critical
obstacles to the progress of the project, and finding solutions on the spot, involving the government,
top management of IDBI/ICICI and the cement companies as necessary. At every stage, the Bank
performed adequately and even organized, at the very top levels, discussions that may not have taken
place without Bank's good offices.
G. Borrower's Performance
20.   The borrower at the different tiers, first the government who signed the Loan Agreement,
second IDBI/ICICI who signed the Project Agreement and then, the Cement Companies who executed
subsidiary agreements with IDBI/ICICI, all performed with a high degree of commitment to the
objectives and purposes of the loan. The physical/economic targets and the prescribed environmental
standards were attained. Two major difficulties faced in an otherwise spotless performance were (a)
the technical problems that TISCO faced with the rollers in grinding and (b) the delay delivery of the
special wagons for transportation of bulk cement. The former is attributed to consultant having
recommended the bandage type design for rollers not suited to the duties in tenns of process and
equipment, procured and ultimately replace. The latter was partly force majeure, but partly avoidable
by the wagon manufacturer.

H. Assessment of Outcome
21.   Ratings of 'High Satisfactory' are assigned to three of the large sub-projects and 'satisfactory'
to the other two, as indicated in Appendix C. The Bulk Transportation component merits
'satisfactory' only, due to delays in wagon delivery. The government controlled components of HRD
and TA were completed in a 'High Satisfactory' manner. The Project, as a whole, is rated
"Satisfactory". It lent support to the sustenance of the liberalized industry. It further achieved
regional production capacity redistribution, adoption of modern technology in cement making,
upgrading of technical and managerial skills and introduction of a bulk cement transport system.
I. Future Operations
22.   The five cement companies that implemented the five large sub-projects under the industry
Restructuring and Modernization' component have planned to achieve practically full capacity
production in 1997-98, having attained over 80% of full capacity in 1996-97. The two smaller sub-
projects have no measurable output to watch. Of the other components, it is the bulk cement
transportation by rail between the cement factory at Wadi (Andhra Pradeh) and the receiving terminal
at Mumbai, the expansion of the activity from two rake movement to three and the development of
the market for bulk cement. The financial position of Bulk Cement Corporation (BCC) also requires
constant monitoring in terms of the outline given in Appendix D. As pointed out therein, a major
financial risk is that the debt service coverage times in the 4 or 5 years of operation is likely to be less
than 1.0 improving later gradually to the targeted 1.5 times. ACC, as promoter of BCC has assured in
a letter that it would provide BCC with additional funds, as necessary from time to time to ensure that
BCC maintains a debt service coverage of 1.5 times throughout the currency of the loans.
J. Key Lessons Learned
23.   This project has demonstrated the following:
(a) A free market is requisite for the rapid growth of an industry. In a developing country,
however, the government may play a supportive role in indicating opportunities, in extending
incentives, in providing the infrastructure facilities and in the readiness to meet with the industry
representatives to resolve problems beyond their control (paras. 4 and 7).
(b) To be competitive and efficient and to have staying power, the industry must possess and
continuously upgrade its technical and management skills and knowledge (paras. 5c and 10)
(c) Any technology that is introduced in a developing country should have been proved
elsewhere for process, magnitude and equipment. If an adequate track record has not been
established, great care should be exercised in selecting technology and equipment and sufficient
protections built in for modifications and changes (para. 1 7b).
(d) In planning projects, a holistic approach that should include what external agencies
should provide is necessary. Power, transportation, access roads and such other support, in regard to
their availability and dependability have to be assessed and build in abinitio (para. I 7c).
(e) In a context of high interest rates on loans (far in excess of the inflation rates), greater
attention should be paid to the capital structure so that the debt to equity ratios are carefully
determined at start of a project. The project costs could become high due to interest during
construction and delays in commissioning could have a deleterious effect on the finances of a project.

Appendix A
Disbursement:
6.    As of May 31, 1997, US$ 269 million had been disbursed, leaving an available balance of
US$ 24 million. IDBI/ICICI expect to use another US$ 10 million by October, 1997 (The details of
utilization are given in Annex 2). This would leave an uncommitted balance of about US$ 14
million which would be canceled on the closing date. The outstanding invoices against the
contracts performned by the closing date would be eligible for payment from the proceeds of the
Loan until October 31, 1997.
Status of Sub-Projects
7.    Some general comments are briefly made in the following paragraphs while a technical
review (and operation plan) is presented in Annex 3.
7.1    ACC - Gagal : The plant, commissioned in September 1994, operated satisfactorily in
1996-97 [1.09 million tons per year (tpy)] at 109% of design capacity. Efficiencies in coal and
power use as rated are being realized. Towards environmental protection, all emissions are below
prescribed limits. Several thousand additional trees have been planted to improve the green belt.
The mission commended ACC on these efforts.
7.2    Gujarat Ambuja - Himachal: The plant, commissioned in September 1995. It exceeded
target production from test runs and achieved average 90% of design capacity (1.5 million tpy)
production in 1996-97. It is expected to achieve 133% (2 million tons) in 1997-98 (Clinker is
ground at plant site at Darlaghat as well as at Ropar grinding facility). The management reported
that truck movement has been streamlined following action taken by the company to widen the
road. ICICI representatives visited the plant site in May 1997 and were impressed by the
improvements made in transportation of clinker to Ropar, since the mission's last visit in
September 1996. Efficiency in use of coal has been realized as rated, but the rated power efficiency
is expected to be attained in 1997-98. Environmental standards are fully complied with.
7.3    TISCO: TISCO has achieved an important project objective, namely utilizing blast
furnace slag generated in the process of steel manufacture. In 1996-97, TISCO produced at 74% of
the design capacity of 1.73 million tpy of cement. TISCO has reported that it has resolved all the
major technical problem faced by it during the last several months, since commissioning of the
Sonadih and Jojobera plants between October 1993 and March 1994. The rollers supplied with the
original imported equipment were replaced with their own designed and fabricated rollers. The
mission was pleased to note that TISCO has also resolved the rail transportation problems partly by
availing of the 'Own Your Wagons' scheme. As a result, production in 1997-98 is expected at full
design capacity. TISCO has fully complied with the environmental standards.
7.4    JK Corp. : (Laxmi Cement Unit II) - JK had commissioned this unit (capacity 0.9 million
tpy) in September 1995. JK took up the addition of a complementary unit (Unit 111) with its own
finances, so that the production from the two units could be raised to 2.0 million tpy by June 1997.
Unit III is now expected to be completed by September 1997. In Unit II, JK has achieved full
capacity production in test runs. However, average production in Unit II in 1996-97 was 70%. JK
has fully complied with the environmental standards, and achieved target efficiency parameters in
operations of various units commendably.

Appendix A
7.5    Century - Maihar 2: The plant was commissioned in March 1996 with a design
capacity of 1.0 million tpy, which was fully achieved in test runs. In 1996-97, 79% of design
capacity production was achieved and Century plans to reach full capacity in 1998-99, depending
on the market conditions. The mission commended Century on its environmental management on
achieving the target environmental standards, even exceeding these in some instances, and on the
development of a green belt of a high order around the plant. The operational ef-ficiencies in coal
and power consumption are as rated or better.
7.6    Bulk Cement Transport Pilot Project
The mission held discussions with the management of BCC and visited its site at Kalamboli. The
mission was pleased to note the good progress made at Kalamboli. The plant is ready to receive the
first rake of Bulk Cement wagons. Tasks which remain are painting, landscaping and cleaning up.
All equipment have been installed and tested satisfactorily.
The mission, along with the Chief Executive of BCC, also visited the plant of the wagon supplier
(CIMMCO) at Bharatpur, on June 23, 1997,. The CIMMCO chief assured BCC of the supply of
the wagons as scheduled. The mission was satisfied with the quality of the wagons built.
7.7    Birla Corp Ltd.
The company had undertaken modernization/replacement of existing and old equipment and
installation of equipment with a view to have better operational efficiency, lower cost, better
environment, energy conservation and consistent production.
Human Resources Development Component (HRDC)
8.     The mission reviewed the progress of this component with Mr. Manohar, Program
Coordinator, and the officials of MOI managing this component. The mission noted that all the 4
Regional Training Centers (RTCs) established are continuing to function satisfactorily. In all, 49
training packages were prepared by the consultants. These are being fully utilized. Until March 31
1997, the RTCs had conducted 247 courses and had trained 3016 personnel. The Project
Coordinator informed the mission that a workshop "Visioning for RTCs in year 2003" was
conducted in which senior executives of lead and core plants participated with interest. The
training centers would be sustained with such revised arrangements as necessary. A Coordination
Council comprising the MOI and Cement Plant representatives has been set up to ensure the
continued functioning of the RTCs.
Technical Assistance - Studies
9.     All the 6 studies under the loan have been completed satisfactorily. MOI indicated that the
recommendations made in the study were useful for making policy decisions on cement industry.
Preparation of Implementation Completion Report (ICR)
10.    All the sub-project entities have prepared their completion reports with guidance from the
mission. IDBI/ICICI would forward their report, in consultation with GOI by July 31, 1997. The
Bank would draft its ICR and forward it for GOI's review and acceptance, in due course.

Appendix A
Other Matters
11    Promotion of Bulk Cement and use of Ready Mix Concrete (RMC)
11.1   The President of the RMC association met the mission and informed it that the use of
RMC was gaining ground, although slowly. 12 RMC batching units have started functioning in
various parts of the country and major builders appreciate the advantages of RMC in contrast to
use of bagged cement. Use of bulk cement has to go hand in hand with the setting up of RMC
batching plants in order that efficiencies in the use of cement, the quality of the concrete and in
construction time are all realized. MOI is aware of the economic benefits to the country in
transporting cement in bulk and in the use of RMC in construction, building of concrete roads etc.
The mission has no doubts that MOI/GOI will provide necessary encouragement to the users, offer
incentives as feasible, and at least eliminate inhibiting factors such as redundant excise duties or
other levies, as are said to prevail.
Loan 2660-IN
11.2    The Implementation Completion Report (ICR) dated January 23, 1995 (Report No.
13920-IN) had brought out the continuing problems experienced by two (out of seven) sub-projects
-IDCOL and Kalyanpur- although the loan had closed on June 30, 1994, after two extensions of
one year each and the ICR was issued. The Mission, as indicated in the ICR and as advised by the
Operations Evaluation Department of the Bank in May 1997, while forwarding the draft
Performance Audit Report, took advantage of its current presence in India to review the progress
of these two sub-projects. The financial position of both the companies is of serious concern. The
mission held discussions, not only with the management of IDCOL and Kalyanpur (at Delhi and
Mumbai respectively), but also with the top management of IDBI and ICICI. Annex 4 presents
brief details on the current unsatisfactory status of the two companies.
12.    This is the last supervision mission for this project.

Appendix B
India Cement Industry Restructuring Project
(Loan 3196-IN)
Summary Of Borrower's Final Evaluation
Introduction
1.    The Indian Cement Industry saw a rapid growth during 1980s, but still outdated
technologies, viz. wet process technology were prevalent in many of the operating plants, having
high energy consumption and poor pollution control norms, thereby leading to inefficient use of
resources and deterioration of environment. Under the India Cement Industry Project Lines 2660
and 2661-IN. The World Bank, along with the institutions encouraged cement companies to adopt
latest technology.
2.    At the start of Seventh five year plan in 1985-86, the total installed capacity was 40.69
million tpa. However, there were regional imbalances in the country in terms of demand-supply
leading to high transportation of cement across the country, as also straining the existing
infrastructure of the country. To counter the same, under the Cement industry Restructuring Project
LN 3196 - IN, capacity addition in deficit areas was encouraged and a pilot plant was proposed to
demonstrate benefits of bulk cement transportation by tail in India, in line with the latest
transportation method existing in the developed economies.
3.    Involvement of the World Bank: Following the discussions with GOI, IDBI/ICICI and
cement industry representatives, the World Bank decided to support build-up of capacities in
deficit regions, particularly in northern and eastem regions and for setting up a pilot plant to
introduce bulk cement transportation in India.
4.    The project was approved by the Bank Board in May 1990 and the loan became effective
in October 1990. The project underwent a change following dropping out of one of the projects
viz.J.P. Assam and the scope of the Bulk Cement Pilot Project changed substantially. The initial
loan closing date of the line was June 30, 1996, but three extensions later, mainly because of delay
in implementation of bulk cement project, the loan closed on June 30, 1997.
II. Project Design
5.    The project consisted of three parts with Part A-Financing Industry. Modemization and
restructuring . Part B - Human Resource Development and Part C - Technical Assistance. While
Part A, was administered by IDBI/ICICI, Part B & C were administered by GOI, Under Part B
assistance was provided for establishment of Regional Training Centers and Consultants' services
for the purpose of assisting the cement industry to meet its demand for skilled manpower. Under
Part C, viz. Technical Assistance, studies relating to cement industry have been carried out.

III. Project Objectives
6.     The objectives of the project were to support the cement industry moderation and
restructuring in India. Five sub-projects viz. ACC-Gagal, TISCO, Century - Maihar, J.K. Corp.
And Gujarat Ambuja - Himachal, were supported for setting up green-field cement plants and
expansion of existing plants catering to the cement deficit regions. The Bulk Cement Corporation
(India) Ltd., was established for introducing bulk cement transportation in India, Birla Corp.
(Erstwhile Birla ). Another unit was financed for modernization of its mining and material
handling facilities. Also 4 Regional Training Centers (RTCs) were established under the line to
meet the demand of skilled manpower in the industry. Technical studies on coal washeries for
cement, export opportunity for cement plants in coastal area and utilization of lignite in cement
plants and technical studies for mini cement plants and on development of market for bulk cement
in India and bulk cement transport and distribution projects at Calcutta and Delhi were undertaken
under this line.
Part A: Industry Modernization and Restructuring
7.     Five sub-projects viz. ACC-Gagal, TISCO, Century - Maihar, J.K. Corp and Gujarat
Ambuja - Himachal, were supported for setting up green-field cement plants and expansion of
existing plants catering to the cement deficit regions. The Bulk Cement Corporation (India) Ltd.,
was established for introducing bulk cement transportation in India. Birla Corp (erstwhile Birla
Jute), another unit was financed for modernization of its mining and material handling facilities.
Part B: Human Resources Development
8.    Establishment and development of 4 Regional Training Centers (RTCs) to meet the
demand of skilled manpower in the industry.
Part C: Technical Assistance
9.     Undertaking studies and technical assistance programs relating to the project including
tecno-economic studies for coal washeries for cement, export opportunity for cement plants in
coastal area and utilization of lignite in cement plants and technical studies for mini cement plants
and on development of market for bulk cement in India and bulk cement transport and distribution
projects at Calcutta and Delhi.
IV. Project Implementation
10.   All the projects were completed with 5% of the appraised cost in US Dollar terms and have
performed satisfactorily. Only the Bulk Cement Pilot Project was delayed due to various reasons
necessitating extension of the closing date of the line by one year. The company would start
operations from 1997-98.
11.    The project costs as given below indicate even a saving in US Dollar for some of the sub-
projects primarily due to changes in the Rupee/Dollar partially { 1 US$ = Rupees 17 at Staff
Appraisal Report (SAR) stage and I US$ = Rupees 35.8 in 1997}. However, in Rupee terms, the
cost overrun occurred due to fluctuation in exchange rate, as well as increase in local costs.

Appendix B
12.   ACC-Gagal: The project was completed in September 1994 as against April 1993 (as per
the original appraisal) after a delay of 18 months. The delay was mainly due to rebidding of ICB
Packages. However, the project was completed within 30 months from date of placement of orders
which is considered satisfactory.
13.   The completed cost of the project was US$ 85.43 million (Rs. 2677 million) against the
SAR estimate of US$ 92.3 million (Rs. 2400 million). The main components of the overrun in
rupee loans were increase in cost of land and site and pre-operative expenses. However, due to
fluctuation in parity between Rupee and Dollar, the project has actually had a saving in dollar
terms, which the company surrendered.
14.   TISCO  The commercial production commenced in October 1993 at Sonadih and April
1994 at Jojobera as against April and October 1993 (as per original appraisal) i.e. after a delay of 5
months. However, the plant faced a major equipment, design problem in the slag-grinding circuit,
which the company could overcome after replacing the rollers.
15.   The actual project cost was US$ 156.46 million (Rs. 4230 million) as against the original
estimate of US$ 147 million (Rs. 2650 million), mainly due to increase in the cost of land and
building and plant and machinery.
16.   Century - Maihar: The plant commenced commercial production in March 1996 as against
October 1993 estimated earlier. The delay of about 30 months is mainly on account of delay in
getting environmental clearance from State/Central Government and delay in delivery of-
equipment.
17.   The actual project cost was US$ 151.67 million (Rs. 4821 million) as against US$ 118.09
million (Rs. 3650 million). The increase in rupee term is mainly due to increase in pre-operative
expenses and cost of land development.
18.   JK Corp (formerly Straw Products): The plant commenced commercial production in
March 1995 as against estimates of July 1994; the production in 1995-96 was not significant due to
teething troubles and the same could be stabilized only from second half of 1996.
19.   The actual project cost was US$ 110.71 million (Rs. 3394 million) as against US$ 120
million (Rs. 2250), mainly due to increase in cost of land and building and plant and machinery.
20.   Gujarat Ambuja: The plant commenced commercial production from September 1995 as
against July 1994, after a delay of 14 months, due to change in scope of the project. The project
was however completed within 30 months from placement of orders, which is considered
satisfactory. However, the targeted production of 1.5 mtpa was achieved from April 1996.
21.   The actual project cost was US$ 148.60 million as against US$ 146.75 million, mainly due
to change in scope of the project and increase in cost of plant and machinery. An additional amount
of US$ 10 million (over and above original loan of US$ 60 million, which was fully utilized) was
sanctioned to the company for procurement of DG sets; out of which the company was able utilize
US$ 9.02 million.

Appendix B
22.   Bulk Cement Corporation (India) Ltd (BCC): BCC was a pilot project to demonstrate the
advantages of bulk cement transport and subsequently promote usage of bulk cement in India. For
this purpose, ACC, the largest cement producer in India, agreed to participate in the project. BCC
proposed to procure 2 rakes of special wagons for transport of bulk cement from ACC - Wadi too
Kalamboli. The project was originally expected to be completed by June 1996 but the project has
been delayed by more than a year due to the delay in the delivery of wagons. The wagons were
delivered in June 1997. The company would start operations from 1997-98.
23.   Birla Corp Ltd (Formerly know as Birla Jute and Industries Ltd): The assistance was
provided to finance purchase of capital equipment like D.G sets, mining machinery, material
handling equipment, etc. by Birla Corp. Ltd. The company has installed the equipment and would
derive the benefits in the coming years.
24.   Technical Assistance and Training: GOI effectively utilized US$ 0.3 million under this
loan for undertaking tecno-economic studies for coal washeries for cement, export opportunity for
cement plants in coastal area and utilization of lignite in cement plants. GOI also undertook
technical studies for mini-cement plants and on development of market for bulk cement in India
and on development of market for bulk cement in India and bulk cement transport and distribution
projects at Calcutta and Delhi.
25.   Human Resources Development: The Regional Training Centers (RTCs) that were setup
under the Line 2660 in matured under the line. All 49 training packages procured are in use. The
trainers were initially trained and more than 3500 personnel have been trained at the RTCs. The
industry and GOI together are now working towards attaining Sustainability of these RTCs.
V. Achievement of Objectives
26.   The project was conceived to reduce the demand-supply imbalance in the northern and
eastern regions of the country. In 1990-91 North, India has installed capacity of 11.19 million
(MM) tons which by 1996-97 increased to 23.16 MM tons. Similarly East India, had an installed
capacity of 4.99 MM in 1990-91 which by 1996-97 increased to 7.5 MM tons. Thus the project has
succeeded in reducing the demand -supply imbalance in the country. All the completed projects
have achieved the technical and financial parameters set out at the time of the appraisal. The
project under implementation - Bulk Cement Corporation (India) Ltd., is also expected to achieve
its coatimated objects.
27.   ACC-Gagal: The company has been able to achieve capacity utilization of 112%. The
company has also achieved fuel efficiency of kilo of 762 kcal/kg (Rated - 800 kcal/kg) and power
to achieve guaranteed power consumption factor during the current year.
28.   TISCO: The company has been able to achieve 72% capacity during 1996-97 and expects
to reach rated capacity during 1997-98. Guaranteed fuel consumption was achieved and fuel
consumption is 720 kcal/kg. The company has achieved rated power consumption of 105 kwh/ton
at Sonadih while power consumption is 88 kwh/ton (Rated - 81 kwh/ton) at Jojobera.



- 24 -
Appendix B
29.   Century-Maihar: The company achieved a capacity utilization of 79% in 1996-97 and
expects it to gradually rise to full capacity over the next three years. The current fuel consumption
is 750 kcal/kg (Rated - 750 kcal/kg). Against the rated power consumption of 104 kwh/ton power
assumption of 108 kwh/ton has been achieved.
30.   J.K. Corp (Formerly Straw Products): The company has been able to achieve capacity
utilization of 76% during 1996-97 and expects to reach rated capacity during 1997-98. The
company has achieved rated fuel efficiency of 725 kcal/kg while power consumption is 103
kwh/ton (Rated 105 kwh/ton),
31.   Gujarat Ambuja: The company has achieved 94% capacity utilization of its revised
capacity of 2 million tons and expects to achieve 120% capacity utilization during 1997-98. The
company has achieved 718 kcal/kg of fuel consumption against rated 723 kcal/kg and 116 kwh/ton
of power consumption against rated 105 kwh/ton.
32.   Bulk Cement Corporation of India (BCC): BCC received wagons in June 1997 and the
operations would start in the year 1997-98. The capacity utilization would gradually buildup over
the years. While initially the consumption of bulk cement would be low about 50%. It is expected
to rise over 70% in 3 years after the benefits of use of bulk cement is demonstrated.
33.   All cement projects have met environmental standards as per the equipment design, which
are below the prescribed norms by State Governments. BCC has the necessary equipment for the
environmental control to achieve the required emission levels.
VI. Performance of Borrower
34.   The World Bank loan was intended to rectify the regional imbalances of demand-supply in
the country. The project helped in capacity build-up in the deficit regions, thereby reducing cross
country movement of cement to a great extent.
35.   IDBI and ICICI were associated with the project from the inception. Their role included
identifying sub-borrowers, appraising projects, obtaining loan sanctions, helping the beneficiaries
in observing ICB guidelines, disbursing funds and monitoring implementation of sub-projects.
IDBI and ICICI were actively associated from the conception stage of Bulk Cement Pilot Project
and have also provided requisite support in the form of equity.
36.   IDBI/ICICI have been co-ordinating with follow-up supervision visits undertaken by the
World Bank mission regularly and arrange meeting with the concerned officials in the Ministry of
Finance/Ministry of Industry, GOI, Railway Authorities, equipment suppliers. consultants and sub-
borrowers.

Appendix B
VII. Bank Performance
37.   After the success of the first line of credit for cement industry (2660-IN and 2661 -IN), a
considerable interest was generated to avail further finance from World Bank to rectify the
regional imbalances of demand-supply in he country. The Bank loan was negotiated at this time,
when foreign exchange for import of machinery was scarce and in a scenario of rapid devaluation
of rupee vis-A-vis foreign currencies. The Rupee-tied foreign currency loan for import of latest
state-of-the-art equipment was appreciated by the industry. The project helped in capacity build-up
in the deficit regions, thereby reducing cross country movement of cement to a great extent.
VIII. Key Lessons Learnt
38.   The loan was approved, at a stage when there was a scarcity of foreign exchange and the
country was witnessing regular depreciation of rupee vis-a-vis foreign currencies. GOI agreeing to
bear the foreign exchange risk came as a boon to the sub-borrowers as they availed Rupee-tied
assistance for import of machinery, which translated to repayment obligation in rupee,. Due to the
participation of international vendors in the bidding process the sub-borrowers received an
exposure of the state-of-the-art technologies prevailing in the world, which helped them to procure
equipment of latest technology, thereby obliterating the technology gap existing between the Indian
cement industry and that of the developed economies.
39.   During the first line of credit to cement industry, the industry and IDBI/ICICI had received
sufficient exposure in the ICB Procedures, which made compliance of procedural norms easier in
administering the second line of credit 3196-iN.
40.   The import duties and excise duties exempted under the line, (if ICB procedures were
followed). The benefit of the same was passed on to the sub-borrowers by the equipment suppliers,
thereby reducing the project cost to that extent.
41.   Because of participation of international vendors in the bidding process, the sub-borrowers
received an exposure of the state-of-the-art technologies prevailing in the world, which helped
them to procure equipment of latest technology. As a domino effect, subsequent projects utilized
the best technology, thereby obliterating the technology gap existing between the Indian cement
industry and that of the developed economies.
42.   As regards disbursements by World Bank, it is felt that these could have been made on the
basis of certification done by IDBI/ICICI instead of the procedure of scrutinizing the documents by
three different agencies -viz. IDBI/ICICI; GOI and the World Bank.
43.   It is felt that the requirement of environmental impact assessment could have been done
away with for existing units envisaging installation of pollution control equipment and/or
modernization of the plant not leading to an increase in the capacity. This would have facilitated
better utilization of the line in the last two years without diluting the main objectives of the line.
44.   While the line encouraged sub-borrowers to access latest technology from international
equipment suppliers, care should be taken to accept only proven technology. A developing country
can ill-afford to experiment or be experimented upon for new unproved technologies.



-26 -
Appendix B
45.   It would facilitate IDBI/ICICI to ensure better utilization of the line if extensions for the
validity of the line are communicated well in advance of the last date of drawl.
IX. Impact of the Project on the Industry
46.   The project was conceived to reduce the demand/supply imbalance in the northern and
eastern regions of the country. In 1990, North India had an installed capacity of 12.24 tones which
by the year 1997 increased to 23.16 MM tons. Similarly East India had an installed capacity of 5.3
MM tons in 1990 which by the year 1997 increased to 8.28 MM tons.
47.   The total installed capacity of the country during the period increased from 64.5 MM tons
to 96.25 MM tons. During the year 1996-97, the supply has grown by over 12% while the demand
has grown at 9%. This has resulted in a temporary surplus in certain sectors of the country.
However with the expected demand growth with infrastructure likely to pick up in the next two- -
years, the demand-supply is likely to get balanced.
48.   There has been a substantial increase in the installed capacity, however the infrastructure
support for transport of bagged cement has not been adequate. The high cost of transportation and
the infrastructure bottlenecks would result in movement of cement in bulk form picking up.
49.   The pilot bulk cement project will demonstrate the usage of bulk cement in the country by
the construction industry and would also encourage industry to put up Ready Mix Concrete plants.
The line would therefore not only have a positive long term impact on the cement industry but also
on the construction industry in India.

Cement Industry Restructuring Project (Loan 3196-IN)
Industry Modernization and Restructuring Component
1.    Introduction: The 'Industry Modernization and Restructuring', which included
installation of 5 new plants was one of four components of the Cement Industry Restructuring
Project but it comprised about 90% of the loan outlay. Due to the reason that IDBI/ICICI appraised
all the sub-projects under this component subsequent to loan approval by the Board (except for one
sub-project), a brief description of the sub-projects, and of their implementation and operation is
given in this annex. The Loan/Project agreements had laid down the criteria to be followed in
selecting the sub-projects. Bank's prior approval was required for larger sub-projects appraised
above $20 million. The SAR had identified five sub-projects the cost of which would exceed $20
million each. One of these projects in Assam area did not take off. Later JK Corp., Laxmi Plant
was included as a substitute project. All subprojects i.e. ACC-Gagal, Century Maihar, TISCO,
Gujarat Ambuja in HP/Punjab and JKCorp in Rajasthan, were appraised by IDBI/ICIC, and
reviewed and cleared by the Bank. IDBI/ICICI also approved two smaller projects, Birla Corp Ltd.
and JKCorp Ltd., for buying and installing certain equipment to improve operational efficiency and
the environment.

Small subprojects
Birla Corp Ltd.
ICICI approvals given in November '95 and March '96 for procurement of 'certain mining
equipment, diesel locomotive and electronic packing machines' and for 'certain process and
material handling equipment' for the Chittorgarh cement plant in Rajasthan (converted to dry
process under Loan 2660-IN. The objective was 'to improve the productivity'. The total amount of
the loans was the rupee equivalent of $1 I million from the proceeds of Loan 3196-IN. Being less
than $20 million, no measures for performance were stipulated. The company has utilized the
equivalent of $8.70 million; the shortfall was due to exchange fluctuations and some items not
procured with the tight time that was available before loan closing, even with extension to June 30
1997. A list of the individual machinery and equipment procured and its purpose compiled by the
company shows that the purchases were well made.
JK Corp Ltd.
As in the case of Birla Corp Ltd., IDBI gave approvals in November '95 and March '96 for JK
Corp Ltd., to avail itself of rupees equivalent to $11 million initially, later reduced to $8.07 million.
This would enable procurement of 'certain additional mining machinery' and equipment for 'raw
mill conversion', and result in operational improvements at the JK cement complex in Rajasthan.
The company could utilize the equivalent of $6.76 million only before loan closing, due to
constraints of time.

B. Rate of Return -Economic and Financial
The following pages contain tables on ERR and FRR of thle five major cement subprojects-
individually, beginning with the consolidated rate calculations. The notes below explain the
assumptions.
(a) Cement Prices: Cement prices, after deregulation, are market determined. Reckoning showed
that imported cement was likely to cost more than the Indian cement, in the different markets. Thus
the selling prices could be taken as the economic prices.
(b) Operating costs: The main tradable commodity used in operation is coal; coal prices, adjusted
for calorific value, ash content etc., compare favorably with import parity prices. For ERR cost
calculations, a significant item that was excluded was the excise duty of Rs.350/ton.
(c) Conversion factors: In the conditions of a floating exchange rate, full duty exemptions on Bank
projects, need for trained employees in modem cement factories etc., conversion factors are not
relevant. In not applying conversion factors, the error, if any, would only give a slightly lower
economic rate of return.

Cement Industry Restructuring Project
Pilot Bulk Cement Transportation Component
Error! Bookmark not defined.
1.     Introduction: This component, although a minor one, which at the time of appraisal was
estimated to cost $50 million (7% of total project cost) with Bank financing 50% of the amount,
was innovative. It would introduce modem bulk cement transport technology in India achieving:
Reduction in rail freight costs in the use of special wagons against conventional wagons
that carry cement in bags
Lower pollution levels when less of bagged cement is transported
Higher efficiency in cement handling and accordingly less of losses
Use of ready mixed concrete (RMC) in building housing, commercial and office
complexes and concrete roadways etc., with minimum wastage and assured quality.
2. Implementation: Danish consultants under a Danida grant submitted a Detailed Project Report
in August 1993. Six cement companies evinced interest initially in participating in a joint stock
company to be set up with GOI as a minority partner, for bulk transportation of cement to
Kalamboli, Mumbai where BCC would establish a receiving terminal with silos, bagging plant and
tanker trucks. The participating cement companies would erect bulk loading facilities at their
factories and realize cost savings through higher efficiencies in loading. BCC would, for a fee,
receive and distribute the cement in bulk as well as in bags to the consumers in Mumbai. Five of
the six companies eventually withdrew from participation. In the process, the project, in a scaled
down version at one-half of the initial scope with Bank contribution also at one-half, could
commence only in October 1994. While this delay could be attributed to the shying away by the
cement companies, except for one (ACC), from a new venture, the wagon manufacturing company
in India (selected under ICB procedures) principally contributed to further delays, some beyond
control (floods) and others which appeared to be avoidable. As a result, the loan closing date had
to be extended by one year from June 30, 1996 to June 30, 1997. The special wagons were ready to
be deployed in service. The Kalamboli terminal had meanwhile begun operations by receiving
conventional wagons transporting cement in bags from the ACC factory at Wadi.
3. Achievement of Objectives: The objectives outlined in para 1 are obviously achievable once
bulk movement begins. Independently, RMC central batching plants are becoming popular and 12
such plants are in operation in the country including one of ACC's at Kalamboli at a site adjacent
to BCC's. Cement silos for these plants are filled by cement in bags for the present.
4. Economic Justification for BCC Operation: The work plan of BCC and the costs and benefits
are outlined at pages 2 & 3. The economic rate of return is estimated at 10.6%, which is
satisfactory. BCC must, however, promote the demand for bulk cement assiduously in order that
the target of 0.5 million is achieved. BCC will be well advised to expand into other activities also
at Kalamboli, e.g., manufacture of products like prestressed components, precast building
elements, lightweight blocks and panels. A good part of the leased land at Kalamboli stands
unutilized. ACC has some plans in this regard and made a mention of its ACC-SCANFORM
scheme or A-Flat-A-Day, using the Kalamboli site as the supply base.

Appendix D
5. BCC's Financial Position: Due to delays in completion of the project and interest rates at 15-
16% payable to IDBI/ICICI, the project costs (excluding leased land) now placed at Rs. 644
million would exceed the 1994 estimates of Rs. 567 million by 11%. ACC is the majority
shareholder of BCC (67%) and the sole user of BCC's services. The revenues of BCC are from
two sources mainly, service charges that ACC pays and the rail freight rebates that ACC would get
from the Railways for bulk cement movement, but would pass on to BCC (the special wagons are
paid for by BCC). Presumably, BCC would in negotiations of service charges for dispatching and
distributing cement in Mumbai endeavor to capture all of the cost savings accruing to ACC so as to
have a satisfactory financial rate of return.
6. Project Sustainability: The major risk is financial. BCC's debt: equity ratio is 70:30. Interest
payments are substantial and loan repayments, after the moratorium, are due to begin in 2000. Debt
service coverage times in the first 4 or 5 years of operation are likely to be less than 1.0, improving
later as the targeted 0.5 million tons of cement are handled. ACC, as promoter of BCC, has assured
(March 1997) its creditors (ICICI/IDBI) that it would provide BCC with additional funds, as
necessary from time to time to ensure that BCC maintains a debt service cover of 1.5 times
throughout the currency of the loans. BCC should follow up and have a direct agreement with
ACC incorporating this assurance.
