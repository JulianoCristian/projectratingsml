Lessons\n            learned from the project are: 1) a free market is a\n            requisite for the rapid growth of an industry. In a\n            developing country, however, the government has to actively\n            support the transition from a command economy to a free\n            economy; 2) to be competitive and efficient and to have\n            staying power, the industry must possess and continuously\n            upgrade its technical and management skills and knowledge;\n            3) any technology that is introduced in a developing country\n            should have proven track record. Initial price attractions\n            of unproved technology could be ultimately detrimental; 4)\n            in planning projects, a holistic approach that should\n            include what external agencies should provide is necessary.\n            Power, transportation, access roads and other items, in\n            regard to their availability and dependability have to be\n            assessed and built in at the start; and 5) in the present\n            context of high interest rates on loans in India, attention\n            should be paid to the capital structure so that the debt to\n            equity ratios are carefully determined at start of a\n            project. The project costs could become high due to interest\n            during construction and delays in commissioning could have a\n            deleterious effect on the finances of a project."}, "docdt": "1998-04-07T00:00:00Z"}
