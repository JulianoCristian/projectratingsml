First, the project will finance investment projects\n            which are important for the modernization and restructuring\n            of the industry. Second, the project will help establish and\n            finance a pilot bulk cement transport system to transport\n            bulk cement to the greater Bombay area. Successful\n            implementation of this pilot scheme will pave the way to\n            introduce bulk cement transport systems in India. Third, the\n            project will help establish and finance demand-driven\n            training systems and programs to support human resource\n            development compatible with the significant technological\n            transformation of the industry. Fourth, the project will\n            assist DCCI in studying policy and strategic options for\n            mini cement sector, coal washing, use of lignite, pollution\n            control and environmental protection for the cement\n            industry, and further development of bulk cement transport\n            and applications."}, "docdt": "1990-04-10T00:00:00Z"}
