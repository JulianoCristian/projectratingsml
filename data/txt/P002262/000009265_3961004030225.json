was low and\n            its growth rate sustained from 1970 to the mid 1980s. GDP\n            has declined since then due to low coffee prices and poor\n            weather. The objective of this project is to promote swift\n            growth of the Rwandan private sector. The private sector is\n            considered a key element in a strategy for growth and\n            diversification. The project will promote efforts to ensure\n            that the private sector has access to investment financing\n            and managerial and technical support. It will also support\n            efforts to improve the legal and regulatory environment and\n            enhance the investment and export incentives. The three\n            components of the project which will aid in achieving these\n            goals include: line of credit; private sector support fund;\n            and institutional strengthening. The Rwandan government\n            believes that growth led by the private sector can provide\n            employment and make a significant contribution to export\n            earnings. The project is a complement to Rwanda's\n            macroeconomic adjustment program already in place."}, "docdt": "1993-08-18T00:00:00Z"}
