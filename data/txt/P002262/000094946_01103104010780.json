The project was implemented in a very\n            difficult period in Rwanda and made an important\n            contribution to helping the country in its transition from\n            war to peace. Given the private business investments\n            financed under the line of credit component, the\n            institutional improvements implemented at the central bank\n            and the institutional and legal reform process started,\n            sustainability of the project is likely. Both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances were rated satisfactory: The Bank\n            maintained the dialogue with the Borrower during the\n            difficult period after the war and helped significantly in\n            ensuring effectiveness of the project; and while there were\n            significant delays in all components of the project, the\n            Borrower carried out a large scope of activities in a\n            satisfactory way. These were some of the lessons learned:\n            Separate legal and regulatory reforms from technical\n            assistance. In the aftermath of a civil war, projects have\n            to be adjusted to the new circumstances and be focused on\n            priorities. A constituency for reform is crucial for\n            implementation. Capable implementing agencies are critical\n            for implementation. Instruments need to fit country\n            circumstances. Structural deficiencies in the financial\n            sector have to be addressed to guarantee long-term viability\n            of the sector."}, "docdt": "2001-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
