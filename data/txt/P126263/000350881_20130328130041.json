follows: overall outcome was highly\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, and the Bank and the borrower performance were\n            satisfactory. There were some important project lessons\n            learned. (1) Fast track emergency operations for migration\n            are feasible. (2) The Bank can be responsive to borrower\n            needs in emergencies, but this requires flexibility in the\n            application of Bank rules. (3) Simplicity of project design\n            facilitates implementation in emergency operations and\n            provides a greater opportunity for achieving project design.\n            (4) Planning for the unplanned is important because\n            emergencies are dynamic and identification of additional\n            needs may not be possible. (5) Emergency operations cannot\n            wait for rigorous analytic work to inform design; however,\n            to the degree possible, the Bank needs to take stock of the\n            situation. (6) Development of operational manuals prior to\n            the first disbursement of a cash transfer is good practice\n            and feasible in emergency situations. (7) Third-party\n            processes audits could be important accountability and\n            control mechanisms. (8) Emergencies provide opportunities to\n            build systems to reduce the impact of future shocks. (9)\n            Emergency operations should endeavor to include support for\n            capacity building and knowledge generation. (10) If designed\n            well, it is possible to achieve high returns without\n            incurring large administrative costs. (11) Conversion of\n            local currency into home country currency for migrants is a\n            good practice which should be included in future\n            repatriation operations."}, "docdt": "2013-03-25T00:00:00Z"}
