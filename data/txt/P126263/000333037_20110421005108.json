Bangladesh to: (i) repatriate its migrant workers, who have\n            fled the ongoing conflict in Libya ('the\n            emergency'), from refugee camps in neighboring\n            countries in a timely manner; and (ii) provide a one-time\n            cash grant as a transitional safety net measure to help them\n            meet immediate basic needs and commence the process of\n            livelihood restoration. The credit will contribute to\n            financing the costs associated with the repatriation and\n            commencement of restoration of livelihoods of Bangladeshi\n            migrant workers who have fled Libya due to the severe\n            deterioration of the security situation in the country.\n            Relief efforts in the camps in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt\n            are mostly provided by the United Nations High Commissioner\n            for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Federation of the\n            Red Cross/Red Crescent (IFRC), while the International\n            Organization for Migration (IOM) has been the lead agency in\n            organizing the repatriations in close coordination with\n            UNHCR on the ground. With the aid of the IOM, close to\n            30,000 Bangladeshis has been repatriated by April 13, 2011.\n            An estimated 35,000 to 45,000 migrant workers from\n            Bangladesh still remain in Libya, and as of April 13, around\n            1,000 were still in camps such as in Ra's Ajdir on the\n            Tunisian-Libyan border awaiting repatriation. There is a\n            continuing, but modest, daily inflow of new refugees.\n            However, given the ongoing military action in Libya, a\n            further surge of refugees could be expected."}, "docdt": "2011-04-19T00:00:00Z"}
