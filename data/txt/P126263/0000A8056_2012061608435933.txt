                         The Project Development Objective of the emergency Repatriation and Livelihood Restoration for Migrant Workers Project (MWP) is to support the People's Republic of
                         Bangladesh to: (i) repatriate its migrant workers, who have fled the ongoing conflict in Libya (#the emergency#), from refugee camps in neighboring countries in a timely
                         manner; and (ii) provide a one-time cash grant as a transitional safety net measure to help them meet immediate basic needs and commence the process of livelihood
                         restoration.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Repatriation and Livelihood Restoration for Migrant Workers is the first project on migration funded by the World Bank which used fast track emergency procedures to provide
                         UD$40 million to support the Government of Bangladesh to repatriate Bangladeshi migrant workers from Libya at the onset of the conflict in the country in February 2011, as well as
                         help them restore their livelihoods with the help of a one-time cash grant. Of the US$40 million, US$12.6 million has been used to retroactively finance the airfare of 10,000 returnees

                         Libya during the period since end-February 2011. The call center was initiated on July 9, 2011 and in-person verification began from July 23, 2011. With the resolution of the crisis in
                         Libya and no further workers returning, call center operations were terminated on May 10, 2012. As of May 20, 2012, out of the total registered returnees (36683), 36308 were
                         verified and received payment. Out of the remaining 345 persons, 200 had returned abroad while 145 could not be reached. This represents 98.9 percent coverage of the total
                         targeted beneficiaries. The project has fully achieved its development objectives and is closing on June 30, 2012.
