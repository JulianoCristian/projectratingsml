education and improve\n            educational planning and administration. Its aim is to\n            construct, furnish and equip: (a) a 260-capacity technical\n            institute which will produce annually about 160 skilled\n            workers, lower-level technicians, and office personnel\n            annually; (b) training facilities for nurses and paramedical\n            personnel; (c) a management development institute which will\n            train about 150 to 200 middle-level managers annually; (d)\n            30 practical teaching areas in secondary technical schools\n            for science, technology, and practical work; (e) three\n            regional education centers for school administration and\n            teacher retraining and upgrading. The project will establish\n            an educational planning unit within the Ministry of\n            Education and provide 19 man-years of technical assistance\n            and 50 man-years of fellowships. The proposed project\n            presents no unusual risks."}, "docdt": "1978-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
