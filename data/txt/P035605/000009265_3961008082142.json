Project aims to: 1) restore the state's capacity to\n            govern (including creating an environment of security and\n            enforceable contracts); 2) enable the administration to\n            function (provide essential public services and pay for\n            them); and 3) facilitate the operation of the private\n            sector. The latter includes pursuit of the ongoing program\n            of state enterprise divestiture and financial system reform,\n            as well as the initiation of the reform of the cotton\n            sector. Specific objectives include: 1) keeping the civil\n            service working while it is reformed to make it more\n            effective; 2) demobilizing a significant number of soldiers\n            who would settle in active, civilian economic life; 3)\n            restructuring expenditures; and 4) increasing the share\n            allocated to essential development services such as primary\n            education, health and public basic support to private sector activities."}, "docdt": "1996-01-22T00:00:00Z"}
