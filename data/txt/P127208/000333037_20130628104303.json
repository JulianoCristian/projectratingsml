Directors endorsed the operation's focus\n            on strengthening public financial management, public\n            procurement, and electricity sector performance. They\n            welcomed the operation's alignment with the\n            Government's recovery and economic programs and with\n            the World Bank Group interim strategy for FY13-14 and its\n            cross-cutting theme of strengthening governance. Directors\n            noted that the proposed grant builds on previous operations\n            and draws on the Energy Sector White Paper developed jointly\n            with Government and donors. Executive Directors underlined\n            the importance of the improvements in economic governance\n            supported by this grant in enhancing Haiti's capacity\n            to transition from reconstruction and recovery to\n            longer-term development, poverty reduction, and economic\n            growth. Directors noted Haiti's considerable energy\n            challenges and urged the expansion of services to\n            under-served populations. They also urged the Bank to use\n            its convening power to help the country secure much-needed\n            aid flows. Directors recognized the risks of Haiti's\n            weak governance and institutional capacity but expressed\n            satisfaction with the risk mitigation framework proposed and\n            expressed their strong support for substantial World Bank\n            Group involvement in continued support to Haiti's\n            reconstruction and development."}, "docdt": "2013-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
