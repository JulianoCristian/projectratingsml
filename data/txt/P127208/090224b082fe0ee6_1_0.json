unsatisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was high risk, the Bank\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included:  programmatic approach may have been more\n            appropriate in the context of Haiti to ensure greater\n            commitment and stronger implementation; stand-alone\n            operations fail to provide sufficient incentive to meet\n            program objectives. Program design for post-disaster\n            development policy loans should pay great attention to\n            capacity limitations. It would be desirable to perform a\n            stock-taking of available capacity to implement an\n            adjustment program and the nature of the major constraints,\n            to avoid poor implementation. At the same time, concern over\n            the continuing impact of the disaster on the government and\n            implementing agencies should limit the ambition of the\n            program. It is preferable to redesign the operation at\n            appraisal, if necessary, rather than present a high-risk,\n            complex operation to the Board. The importance of\n            cooperation between the units managing technical assistance\n            operations and those managing an adjustment operation is\n            critical for the success of future program. Perhaps some\n            stronger linkages between these functions may be considered\n            in countries where the risks facing adjustment operations\n            are particularly high. Evaluation and monitoring of the\n            program should be a shared responsibility. The design of the\n            evaluation and monitoring mechanism should be discussed and\n            agreed with the government before the appraisal. Supervising\n            the implementation should be a shared responsibility between\n            the Bank and the government; and important changes in the\n            government monitoring team (and vice versa) should be\n            discussed with the Bank."}, "docdt": "2015-06-04T00:07:03Z"}
