F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Development Policy Grant objective is to support the Government of Haiti’s program
of sustainable reconstruction and growth. In particular, the Grant aims at supporting institution
building, and the strengthening of economic governance through: (a) improvements to the
commercial viability of the electricity sector, (b) improved transparency, accountability and
efficiency of public resource use, and (c) continuation of the Government’s economic reform
program and the transfer of resources to the Haitian budget in the event of a financing gap.

                  Implementation Completion and Results Report for an
                 Economic Reconstruction and Growth Development Policy
                             Grant to the Republic Of Haiti

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.    At the time of appraisal, some progress had been made in coping with the devastating
earthquake of January 2010, which killed 230,000 and displaced over a million Haitians. The
election of Michel Joseph Martelly as President in May 2011 marked the first peaceful handover
of power from one democratically elected president to another from a different political party.
However, the political climate remains contentious, with strong tensions between the Executive
and Parliament, which de facto lapsed on January 12, 2013. While the appointment of a business-
friendly prime minister in May 2012 was received positively by the donor community and the
private sector, the clear break with some practices of management of public resources that many
had hoped for was not obvious..

2.    The security situation remains uncertain, due to growing frustration over the increase
in the price of basic foodstuffs, dissatisfaction with the slow pace of reconstruction, and
allegations of corruption. Moreover, two severe hurricanes in 2012 (Isaac and Sandy) had further
disrupted the economy and Government operations, greatly complicating the Government’s task
in managing the reform program while increasing the urgency of Bank support. Thus, the appraisal
mission faced a difficult environment.

3.    Haiti made some progress in establishing macroeconomic stability. After the devastating
earthquake of January 2010 and the subsequent severe recession, the economy recovered by 5.6
percent in FY11. GDP growth fell to 2.9 percent FY12 due to some slowdown in government
investment expenditures, and a hurricane and intense drought that impaired agricultural
production. Inflation declined to 6.5 percent in FY12 from 10.4 percent in the previous year. The
exchange rate, a managed float, remained stable over the two previous years. Despite sharp
fluctuations in trade flows, the current account deficit remained relatively stable (4.6 percent of
GDP in FY11 and 5.7 percent in FY12), and reserves were equivalent to over 6 months of imports.
The fiscal deficit (including grants) was 4.1 percent of GDP in FY11 and 4.8 percent in FY12.
Revenues increased through intensified efforts at tax collection (supported by technical assistance
from the IMF), while current expenditures has been relatively stable.

4.    Shifts in deficits is driven by large external inflows (very large grant inflows after the
earthquake, followed by increased inflows from the oil import financing arrangement with
Venezuela, referred to as PetroCaribe) that financed some capital expenditures and
government social programs. The Government has also been able to access internal financing
from the Central Bank and, by issuing T-bills. Haiti’s pre-earthquake debt levels were significant,
but a series of debt forgiveness arrangements – the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) relief
and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) – sharply reduced external debt obligations from
29 percent of GDP in FY08 to only 8.9 percent of GDP by FY11. Public debt accumulation then
resumed, however, pushing the external debt-to-GDP ratio to 13.3 percent of GDP in FY12, driven


                                                1
by PetroCaribe sources. The IMF has satisfactorily concluded the fifth review of its ECF program
in March 2013.

5.    The main challenges going forward is how to maximize the aid momentum and prepare
for reduced external assistance in the medium term. External financing of 21 percent of GDP
in FY11 and 15 percent in FY12 (from both grants and the oil import financing program) has been
responsible for the bulk of recent social and economic achievements. In preparing for the likely
decline in external assistance, the Government emphasized measures to (i) improve public resource
efficiency – including through public financial management, procurement and electricity sector
reforms; (ii) target grant funding to infrastructure and human capital investment that supports
growth; (iii) foster private sector development through regulatory reform and export promotion in
integrated economic zones; and (iv) mobilize additional resources through fiscal reforms and
public-private partnerships.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved):

6.    The policy areas covered by this program (including public finance management,
electricity sector reforms, and governance) were selected in coordination with other donors,
and represent a subset of policies delineated in the joint donor matrix. A joint-mission of
donors involved in budget support took place in February 2012 to coordinate the policy actions
underpinning the Government’s reform program and budget support operations. This mission
followed on a series of joint supervision missions and consultations among the members of the
Joint Budget Support Group (Groupe Conjoint d’Appui Budgétaire, GCAB), including in
particular the World Bank, IADB, EU, France, Spain, CIDA, USAID, and in collaboration with
the IMF.

7.    The operation’s development objective is to support the Government of Haiti’s
program of sustainable reconstruction and growth. Towards this end, the Grant supports
institution building and the strengthening of economic governance in sectors critical to
reconstruction and growth in the short and medium term: (a) improving the commercial viability
of the electricity sector; (b) improving transparency, accountability and efficiency of public
resource use, leading to increased spending effectiveness across ministries, and (c) supporting the
Government’s economic reform program and the Haitian budget through the transfer of resources.

8.   The operation is built on nine specific, prior actions designed to strengthen
transparency and financial sector management, including:

o establishment and staffing by the Ministry of Planning and External Cooperation of a
  Directorate of Public Investment;
o staffing of the Programming and Analysis Units (UEPs) in line ministries, and adoption of a
  UEP action plan to restructure and strengthen the UEPs;
o adoption of a strategy by the Ministry of Economy and Finance to establish the Single
  Treasury Account, and closure of 301 idle and dormant public accounts at the Central Bank
  and commercial banks;
o issuance and publication of implementing regulations for the 2009 Procurement Law,
  covering the code of ethics for officials involved in procurement activities and the standard
  documents for evaluating bids;

                                                2
o establishment and staffing of procurement units in all line ministries, and provision of
  training by the Commission Nationale des Marchés Publics (CNMP) to the staffs of these
  units;
o rescinding of 5 contracts awarded under the Emergency Law of April 19, 2010;
o initiation by EDH of the use of meter readings from functional remote meters newly installed
  at IPP entry points to verify IPP production levels and inform billing;
o initiation by EDH of on-site meter testing and verified meter readings for at least 200 priority
  customers, reissuance of bills, and implementation of arrears recovery plans, when
  applicable; and
o settling by the Central Government of all FY12 payment delays to EDH.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification:

9.   The objectives of the operation were not revised.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved):

The Grant is intended to support key actions to improve economic governance in public
financial management, public procurement, and electricity sector performance.

Public financial management

10. While Haiti has made progress in budget preparation and transparency, key areas of
public financial management remain weak. The operation focuses on two critical items for
improved transparency and accountability of public resources management: public expenditure
tracking and monitoring, and the establishment of a Single Treasury Account. A system to track
effectively where public funds are spent and what outcomes result is necessary to make
government functioning more transparent and accountable, which in turn could inform spending
priorities and planning for the future. Better expenditure tracking and monitoring is to be facilitated
by streamlining the accounts through which public funds are processed into a Single Treasury
Account, reducing opportunities for funds to be diverted and enabling more efficient cash
management.

11. The system for tracking public expenditures is fragmented and did not provide
comprehensive information. It captures only current expenditures and allocations to line
ministries for domestically-financed investment at the commitment stage. For capital spending,
once funds are transferred by the Ministry of Economy and Finance to the Ministry of Planning
and then onward to projects and/or line ministries, the transaction is accounted as budget
execution. Thus, there is no proper tracking of the status of expenditure processing or project
implementation.

12. The operation supports ongoing measures to improve the integrity of the budget and
the credibility of the public expenditure management system. The Ministry of Planning has
developed and started rolling out in 2009 an information system (SYSGEP) linking line ministries
with the Ministry of Planning, which allows for consolidating data on investment budget execution
and monitoring the related physical execution and outcomes. The Directorate of Public Investment,

                                                  3
under the Ministry of Planning, is in charge of operationalizing the system, relying on the
Programming and Analysis Units (Unités d’Etudes et de Programmation – UEPs) in line
ministries, which are tasked with entering into the system data on investment at various stages of
execution for further centralization and treatment at the level of the Ministry of Planning. By the
closing date of the Grant in June 2014, it is expected that the Directorate of Public Investment will
have published quarterly budget execution reports using SYSGEP, containing information on
public investment financed through the government budget – including the proceeds of
PetroCaribe – beyond the commitment stage, with information covering line ministries and by
project.

13. In a complementary effort to improve control over public resources, and more broadly
to improve the efficiency of their use, the Government also has started implementing the
measures needed to establish a Single Treasury Account. The Ministry of Economy and
Finance has completed an inventory of public accounts held by line ministries at the Central Bank
and commercial banks, identifying a total of 569 accounts. By the closing date of the operation,
the number of bank accounts is to be reduced to three per ministry, which would contribute to
more transparent and efficient public resource use for reconstruction and other priority spending
by avoiding unnecessary borrowing costs and enhancing the Treasury’s control over public
resources.

Procurement

14. The operation supports the establishment of a credible institutional framework for
procurement and upgrading of procurement management capacity. The progress achieved in
procurement before 2010 has stalled after the earthquake. In order to accelerate reconstruction
activities in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, the Government adopted an Emergency
Law that included specific dispositions allowing for limited competitive bidding for public
contracts. While the Government swiftly restored the procurement regulatory body, the CNMP,
policy reform implementation had been slow. As of early December 2011, 14 of the 17
implementing decrees have been adopted, but only four have been published, which delayed the
effectiveness of the Procurement Law. In addition, effective procurement and transparency is
dependent on line ministries submitting annual procurement plans to the CNMP, but procurement
units in most ministries are barely functional, and there is no code of ethics guiding officials
involved in procurement activities (as is the norm in other countries).

15. A specific issue of concern is the new Emergency Law enacted after Hurricane Sandy
in October 2012, which provides for the issuance of a large number of contracts using non-
competitive procurement procedures. The goal is to redress as quickly as possible the severe
damage caused by the storm, which according to Government sources amounts to an estimated
US$120 million.

16. By the closing date of this Grant, it is expected that two-thirds of public procurement
contracts above the prior-review threshold signed after March 31, 2013, and outside of
periods of Emergency Law, will be the result of competitive or limited bidding, using
standard bidding documents. This would represent a significant improvement compared to the
baseline indicator of less than one-third. Continuing technical assistance to the CNMP and the
ministerial procurement units is to be provided to strengthen the application and culture of good

                                                 4
procurement practices. The continuing TA are expected to contribute to address some of the
capacity issues highlighted in this ICR. The Bank is providing technical assistance through the
Infrastructure and Institutions Emergency Recovery Project (US$65 million approved after the
earthquake focused on restoring key economic and financial functions) and recent Additional
Financing (of US$35 million approved on September 2012) to enhance CNMP’s capacity. In mid-
2012, the program support the CNMP to organize a series of training workshops so that agents
working in existing procurement units and relevant officials could effectively use the various
documents underpinning the new legal framework. The Technical assistance under the
Infrastructure and Institutions Emergency Recovery Project has also supported the development
of the CNMP website, and will help develop an information system to enhance record keeping and
reporting of procurement practices. All procuring ministries are expected to submit their FY14
procurement plans to CNMP before October 31, 2013, as required by the Law.
Furthermore, ministerial procurement units are to submit quarterly reports to CNMP on all
procurement activity in their ministries in conformity with the Law, including activity undertaken
under the Emergency Law. This data can then be cross-referenced with public investment
execution information being tracked by the UEPs.

Electricity Sector

17. Finally, the operation supports electricity sector reforms to improve governance and
enhance EDH’s financial performance. Due to a poor management system, the performance of
the national, vertically integrated electricity utility Electricité d’Haïti (EDH) has deteriorated over
time. EDH has been characterized by weak customer services and lack of infrastructure
maintenance, which has affected its revenue performance as well as the quality of electricity
service and supply, including frequent service interruptions and large voltage fluctuations. The
sector’s institutional framework is obsolete, sector policies are out of date, planning and
monitoring of sector activities is inadequate, and vested interests have impeded reform efforts, in
particular by creating bottlenecks for installing meters at IPPs. The compound effect of the
earthquake on power generation, transmission, and distribution further aggravated EDH’s weak
performance. In 2011, bill collection rates were as low as 65 percent, while EDH’s losses stood at
65 percent of the electricity generated (of which commercial losses represented nearly 40 percent).
Only one-fourth of Haiti’s population has access to electricity, and in rural areas, access is around
5 percent.

18. EDH’s weak grid infrastructure, poor commercial performance, and inadequate
controls over sub-contracted electricity generation by independent power producers (IPPs)
have led to a financial drain on Government resources. Due to its inability to meet electricity
demand and in an attempt to expand electricity availability, EDH has subcontracted part of the
production of electricity to IPPs. 3 Unable to cover its operating expenses, including fuel costs and
power purchases, in part because of low bill collection rates, EDH has relied on fiscal transfers
from the Treasury averaging US$200 million annually in recent years (equivalent to 10 percent of
the national budget and 1-2 percent of GDP). 4 IPPs are expected to continue to play a major role
in power generation in Haiti. In particular, as the Government plans to expand electricity coverage

3
  IPPs provided 60 percent of total electricity generation in 2011.
4
  Electricity transfers are unbounded due to their dependence on international oil prices, electricity supply,
unsanctioned theft and bill non-payment, inter alia.

                                                      5
to support development of industry, trade and tourism zones, the demand for reliable electricity is
likely to increase.

19. Past governance reforms to preserve the integrity of public resource management in
the electricity sector have produced modest results. The control system to check the accuracy
of IPPs’ bills is weak, both at the level of EDH and the Government. Ill-equipped, EDH can not
systematically check the power and energy produced by IPPs, and there is no adequate institutional
set-up at the level of MEF and MTPTEC. The Government has made progress through transferring
accountability and responsibility for IPPs to the state power company, initiating a dialogue on the
level of state support needed and the modalities of their transfer to EDH (an essential component
of budget planning for all parties), and the publication of a monitoring table including key data,
despite some irregularity and interruptions. 5 Nevertheless, the risk of overpaying IPPs remains
high, given that EDH cannot accurately measure the amount of power and energy delivered by
IPPs. The Government also has initiated a range of corrective measures to address challenges
related to sector performance, institutional capacity and financial viability, with Bank support
under the Electricity Loss Reduction Project.

20. Nevertheless, these measures have not generated marked improvements in electricity
service delivery or EDH’s financial performance. With respect to the management of IPP bills,
the capacity for EDH to ensure billing accuracy is inadequate, and the incentives for EDH to ensure
billing accuracy and operational efficiency are weak, because EDH ultimately relies on the
sovereign guarantee in the power purchase agreements (PPAs) and passes on all costs to the central
government rather than directly compensating IPPs. IPP invoices submitted to EDH can not be
verified. Improving the management of public transfers and the accountability system in the sector
requires a gradual transfer of payment responsibility away from the Ministry of Finance directly
to EDH through a well-defined financial framework, accompanied by investment in equipment for
EDH to enhance control over power and energy distributed by IPPs; this is being supported through
the purchase and installation of remote meters, an action financed by the Bank’s Electricity Loss
Reduction Project. By the closing date of this Grant, it is expected that the payment of IPPs’ bills
would be based on production levels measured by remote meters and verified by EDH, which
should eliminate any unexplained discrepancies between IPP claims of energy generation and IPP
payments. It is also expected that billing of priority customers would be based on meter readings,
and that no new arrears by the Central Government to EDH for electricity consumption will
emerge.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

21. The Economic Reconstruction and Growth Development Policy Grant was a stand-
alone operation. It was approved on June 18, 2013, became effective on August 29, 2013, and
was closed on June 30, 2014. All 9 prior actions, listed above, were met by the time of Board
approval.

22. With regard to the Policy Grant indicators’ targets: a total of eight expected outcomes
in the areas of public financial management, procurement, and the electricity sector (see (a)
on PDO Indicators), were to be achieved by closure of the operation in June 2014. However
only two were met, two more were completed with some delay, and 5 were not met at the time of
the ICR mission (Table 1) in January 2015. Two key issues impeded achievement of several
targets. The first was the extremely difficult political and economic environment. Tensions
between the government and the legislative branch resulted in extended delays in approving a
budget, which greatly complicated efforts to strengthen administration. Moreover, the continued
impact of the 2010 earthquake and Hurricane Sandy in 2012 on the functioning of government
compounded longstanding weaknesses in public sector administration, including difficulties in
retaining technical staff. The second, however, was the clear resistance to reform objectives by
some responsible authorities, including a lack of commitment to the agreed investment
programming system and the likely obstruction of efforts to improve monitoring of electricity bills.

Public Financial Management

Indicator 1: The Directorate of Public Investment is to publish quarterly budgetary execution
reports using SYSGEP. These reports are to provide accurate information on domestically-
financed investment beyond the commitment state, broken down by line ministries and by project.

23. This objective was not achieved. The Government abandoned SYSGEP as a means of
tracking investment projects, and substituted a different system (SID-Haiti). The
Government apparently preferred this system because the SYSGEP system was cumbersome to
use, and SID-Haiti can be accessed through the Internet, while SYSGEP can only be accessed
through the Government’s systems. The last supervision mission for the operation (in May 2014)
concluded that SID-Haiti was not an optimal system for investment programming. Nevertheless,
the system could be used for this purpose, and the major constraint on investment programming
was seen as the failure to adequately staff the units responsible for investment in the line ministries.

24. Formally speaking, it might have been preferable to modify the target, in light of the
Government’s decision to proceed with a different system than originally envisioned.
However, the goal of providing a regular report on domestically-financed investment as a tool to
improve management of the public investment program would not have been met in any event.

25. The failure to meet the program goal of improving the transparency of public
investment goes beyond the adoption of another software program. The reporting system
was to rely on the establishment of Unités d’Etudes et de Programmation (UEPs) in each line
ministry. However, many of these units were not functioning or were not adequately staffed and

                                                   7
equipped (see Table A2-3 and A2-4). The ICR interviews of the 19 line ministries revealed that
only 5 have a level of satisfaction of more than 3 (5 is the highest score and 1 the lowest)
regarding the number of staff they need to achieve their objective. Only 4 out of 19 line
ministries have a satisfaction rating of more than 3 regarding the quality of their equipment
(computer, offices, and appropriate software). The case of the Ministry of Public Works, a key
ministry for public procurement, illustrates the problems involved: the UEP was still not
effectively functioning at the time of the ICR mission in January 2015. The counterpart in the
Ministry indicated to the ICR team that the budget request to fund the UEP was not fully funded.
the previous year.

26. Moreover, improving investment planning was complicated by the failure to approve
the Government’s budget during the past two years, and the apparent failure of the DIP to
mobilize line ministries to cooperate. The Directorate for Investment Planning is in the Ministry
of Planning, which reported to the Prime Minister during the execution of the program. it is
possible that the lack of their own Minister made it more difficult for the DIP to mobilize other
ministries to cooperate in the reform. One indication of the problems involved was that the UEP
in the Ministry of Planning, the Ministry responsible for carrying out this reform, cannot obtain
adequate information on investments in that Ministry.

Indicator 2: Each line ministry is to hold only three bank accounts (a current account for
operations, an investment account, and a revenue account), and these are to be at the Central
Bank, not at commercial banks.

27. This outcome was not fully achieved by June 2014 (when few ministries were in
compliance), but was completed by September 2014. There appears to have been
considerable initial resistance to this reform at the highest level of government and in some
line ministries. An accompanying requirement was that a public accountant from the
Treasury would have to sign off on each expenditure out of these accounts by each Ministry,
and this may have been viewed as interference in the responsibilities of the line ministries.
Because of the resistance from line ministries, the Prime Minister had to suspend the
implementation of this measure, and requested a reevaluation of its relevance. After the
reevaluation, his strong support of the measure facilitated the cooperation of line ministries.
Both of these measures had to be met for approval of Haiti’s IMF program.

Procurement

Indicator 3: Not less than two-thirds of the public procurement contracts above the prior-review
threshold and signed after March 31, 2013, and outside of periods of Emergency Law, are to be
the result of competitive or limited bidding, using standard bidding documents.

28. This objective was not achieved. The bidding process was to be monitored by a national
procurement committee, but it does not appear that this committee pursued this responsibility very
aggressively, due to lacking capacity, political will, and the power to enforce the Procurement
Law.




                                                8
Indicator 4: All procuring ministries are to submit procurement plans for FY14 to CNMP by
October 31, 2013, and ministerial procurement units are to submit quarterly reports to CNMP on
all procurement activity in their ministries.

29. This objective was not achieved. Only 11 of the 19 Ministries presented their
procurement plans to CNMP by end-October 2013 and only two ministries (Finance and
Education) submitted any quarterly plans. Although, no all line ministries submitted
procurement plans by End-October, 2013 there have been substantial progress on this measure, as
two additional line ministries submitted their procurement plans with delays. Moreover, the ICR
survey revealed that .4 out of the 6 line ministries that did not submit a plan have no procurement
activities. By contrast, the progress on the submission of quarterly reports by line ministries
remained very poor. Many of the ministerial procurement units that were to be responsible for
submitting quarterly reports do not appear to be functioning (see Table A2-4). One reason for the
lack of progress was the failure to pass a Government budget, due to the difficult political situation.

Indicator 5: The $11 million originally allocated to five terminated contracts is to be freed up for
reallocation to other investments.

30.   This objective was achieved.


Electricity Sector

Indicator 6: Payment of bills by independent power producers (IPPs) is to be based on production
levels measured by remote meters and verified by EDH.

31. This objective was not achieved. In the past, EDH purchased electricity from the 3 IPPs
based on the IPPs’ declaration of how much was provided. As a result, EDH may have been
paying for electricity it never received. As of June 2014, two (E-Power and Sogener à Varreux T-
69) of the six meters installed at IPPs (covering 51 percent of IPP production) were functioning.
As of the ICR mission in January 2015, two of the four had been repaired. A World Bank energy
team conducted an on-site assessment of all 3 IPPs in April 2015. All meters were installed and
functioning. However, they were still not functioning remotely, and no evidence of their use to
cross-check bills was provided by EDH. Hence, although substantial progress was made, this
objective was still not met 9 months after the closing of the program. The entire process has been
subject to extensive delays, as there does not appear to be sufficient ownership of this program in
EDH.

Indicator 7: EDH billing of priority customers is to be based on meter readings.

This objective was achieved. The objective was largely met at appraisal. EDH conducted inquiries and
regularized more than 200 customers’ accounts, resulting in a 9 percent increase in revenues.

Indicator 8: The central government is not to incur additional arrears for the consumption of
electricity in FY14.



                                                  9
32. This objective was not achieved by June 2014, when the debt of the central government
to EDH had increased to about $5.4 million. However, these arrears were cleared by January
2015. Note that the arrears of the regions to EDH exceed $50 million, but these arrears were not
considered in the program.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

33. The reform program faced major difficulties. Efforts to improve transparency threatened
the interests of entrenched groups in both the administration and EDH. Moreover, the program
was initiated during a period of political turmoil, and when the country was still in the process of
recovering from natural disasters that had severely disrupted government operations. The
difficulties the government faced from concerted opposition from the legislature, the destruction
of infrastructure from the catastrophic earthquake of January 2010 as well as Hurricane Sandy of
2012, and the longstanding weaknesses of public administration cannot be over emphasized.
Information on progress was often not available, and counterparts often did not engage fully. Many
of the areas are sensitive and required significant reform in an unfriendly environment, where
consensus is difficult to reach. Technical assistance was provided in all major program areas to
address administrative deficiencies, but could not overcome these serious impediments to
achieving the program objectives. The major problems involved ownership, the incentives
framework, and administrative weaknesses.

Ownership

34. While Government policy endorsed the goals of the operation, each step required the
focused attention of the highest levels of the administration, often the Prime Minister or the
Minister of Finance. Limits on these officials’ time, combined with political considerations,
constrained their ability to achieve multiple targets in an extremely volatile political context.

35. This problem was compounded by a lack of ownership by some of the agencies
responsible for carrying out the reform. For example, one goal was to strengthen management
of the public investment program through implementation of an effective planning tool, the
SYSGEP information system. However, the government agency that managed this program were
not really committed to using SYSGEP, and in the end adopted an alternative system that may not
provide the planning capability the government needs. Similarly, effective management requires
adequate reporting by line ministries of progress in their investment projects. However, several of
the line ministries did not ensure that these units were functioning, and even where the units were
operating, they were not always able to access the required information on investment (see Table
A2-3). Indeed, the responsible unit in the Ministry of Planning, which was responsible for overall
management of the investment reforms, could not obtain information about that Ministry’s
investment program.

36. The procurement targets to ensure that most government contracts were subject to
competitive bidding, were not aggressively pursued. Many of the line ministries did not ensure
that the units responsible for collecting this information were functioning properly, and some
delegated procurement to state agencies under their control but not subject to public sector
procurement requirements. Evidence from the ICR interviews that staffing and equipment were
viewed as inadequate to meet this objective were given above.

                                                10
37. There appears to be considerable resistance to following appropriate procurement
rules. In part this may be due to the desire to circumvent controls, but it also stems from a general
impatience in the administration with the delays that procurement rules entail. This culture of
ignoring procurement requirements was deepened when, following hurricane Sandy in October
2012 (which caused extensive damage), the government suspended procurement requirements
under an emergency law. As a result, many officials became accustomed to only minimal controls
on procurement processes, which proved to be a roadblock to efforts to achieve procurement
reform.

38. Finally, the important number of failed attempts by Bank and other donors to reform
the governance of EDH seems to indicate there is considerable resistance to change in that
sector. The improvement of transparency and governance of electricity sector has been part of all
Bank budget support in Haiti since 2005. As shown in Annex 8, electricity sector reform was
included in the series of the three Economic Governance Reform Operations (EGRO) (from 2005
to 2009), and was also one the objectives of the Emergency Development Policy Operation (2010-
2011). These efforts were complemented by substantial Bank’s sectoral intervention under two
Energy Sector operations financed by IDA aimed at making energy more accessible and more
affordable, including i) the Electricity Loss Reduction Project (PREPSEL, US$11 million) aims at
improving the financial viability of EDH (2006-2013), and ii) and the ongoing Rebuilding Energy
Infrastructure and Energy Access Project (US$90 million), approved in September 2012. It is
worth noticing that all the previous budget support interventions were designed to address the same
issues targeted in the current DPO. And Like the current DPO, all of them failed. The program to
base payments to the independent power producers metering never really functioned. According
to EDH management, a lack of human and technical resources hampered the efforts of EDH to
install meters to improve the accuracy of billing. Indeed, EDH even faces difficulties in
monitoring installed meters and managing the information flow, and is contracting with a private
company to perform this service.

Incentive framework

39. The stand-alone operation did not provide adequate support for officials committed to
the program to argue for meeting targets in order to receive disbursements. To some extent
disbursement of the full amount based on prior actions was justified, as the operation followed on
earlier operations that addressed preliminary issues, the anticipation of subsequent operations
provided some incentive for the Government to meet the targets, and key targets were supported
by Bank technical assistance. Moreover, prior actions were accomplished that represented
progress in improving transparency. Nevertheless, the more difficult targets were to be achieved
during the program, but did not trigger any further release of funds.

40. In some cases, the line ministries did not face strong incentives to meet program
objectives, as the implementing agencies lacked the authority necessary to compel
compliance. For example, while the National Procurement Committee was intensely interested
in improving procurement practices, the line ministries were not compelled to respond to requests
for information from the Committee. There is a formal rule that each ministry consult with the
Committee, and the Cour des Comptes - CSCCA (the Supreme Court of Auditors) will not give a
favorable legal opinion without the Committee’s prior sign off on a procurement. However, this
requirement does not appear to be enforced. The CSCCA acknowledged that many contracts were

                                                 11
awarded despite their objection. They point to many instances where procurement contracts have
been paid by Treasury with neither the Committee’s sign off nor the CSCCA’s favorable legal
opinion.

41. Nevertheless, the Government was capable of achieving some difficult program goals
when they were pushed by strong leadership. A lot could be done when high government
officials were actively involved. For example, limiting each ministry to three bank accounts at the
Central Bank was resisted by the line ministries, in particular because a complementary provision
was that accountants from the Treasury would then have to sign off on expenditures made through
the accounts. The accounts have effectively been reduced to three for each entity, and a public
accountant co-signs all checks to be paid by Haiti’s Central Bank. In this case, the counterpart at
the Treasury commented to the ICR mission that the leadership of the Prime Minister and the
Ministry of Finance was essential (see above).

42. Progress also could be made when officials other than cabinet members actively
supported the program. For example, the Ministers and Generals Directors of the Ministries of
Health and Education were strongly supportive of the goals of the operation, and these Ministries
were able to prepare investment plans and did submit procurement reports. It also helped that the
donors who funded some of the investments in these Ministries pushed for improved transparency.

Administrative weakness

43. Weakness in administration, in particular the lack of qualified managers below the
Ministerial level and inadequate technical support, hampered achievement of the program’s
goals. Low salaries in the public sector make it extremely difficult to retain qualified technical
staff. For example, more than 30 percent of the staff in the unit responsible for organizing
information on public sector investment, and more than two-thirds of the staff of the CNMP,
resigned during the course of the operation. The lack of adequate computer and software systems
constrained the organization of information on investment in the line ministries. Moreover, the
January 2010 earthquake’s destruction of records, as well as physical and human capacity,
exacerbated longstanding weaknesses in Haiti’s public sector institutions. These difficulties were
evident during design, and major aspects of the operation, including investment programming,
financial management and the electricity company, were supported by Bank technical assistance.

44. The Government did not devote enough attention to management. No senior official
from the Ministry of Finance was designated for coordinating implementation of the program.
Furthermore, the lack of follow up and leveraging compliance by line ministries during the budget
preparation (planning and allocations) process was a real missed opportunity.

45. Communication of program objectives within the Government was spotty, as line
ministries complained that they were unaware of important program requirements. In some
areas, the authorities responsible for key program objectives do not appear to have requested
aggressively the necessary information from the line ministries. When this was done, it was often
in the form of routine communications (that were frequently ignored), rather than presented as an
integrated program supported by the World Bank. The ICR interviews of the line ministries
indicate that 13 out of the 19 line ministries have been contacted by the relevant implementing
agency to cooperate on the execution of the reform (see Table A2-2). However, only 6 of them

                                                12
knew about the World Bank program. Thus, high-level officials of the Ministry of Public Works
and the Ministry of Commerce, who were in their jobs during the program period, stated (in
January 2015) that they were unaware of the Bank program. 6 Moreover, they approved of the
goals when they were explained, and they would have placed higher priority in responding to
requests had they understood the context. Both Ministries stated that they did collect much of the
information requested under the operation, for example on the investment program, but this
information was not delivered to the central Government agencies responsible for managing the
program. Indeed, following the meeting with Bank staff in January 2015, the Ministry of
Commerce sent a report on its investment program that would have met the requirements of the
operation, had they submitted it to the Government.

46. The Government also faced difficulties in coordinating its efforts in support of the
program. For example, the unit in the Ministry of Public Works responsible for collecting and
transmitting investment information was not functioning owing to lack of funds. According to
Public Works, they could not properly staff this unit because the Ministry of Finance refused the
request for funds to do so. The Ministry of Finance acknowledged that this could have happened,
but felt that Public Works could have obtained the funds had they pushed harder for them.
Similarly, the Ministry of Health, which strongly supported program objectives, did submit
required investment and procurement plans. However, the Ministry did not submit quarterly
reports on procurement, because (according to the Ministry), they never received a request for this
report from the National Procurement Committee.

47. At times, program requirements were not clearly explained to responsible staff. For
example, it does not appear that higher-level authorities explained to the staff managing the
implementation of the new investment programming system that using SYSGEP was a
performance target. Overall, the lack of clarity on the part of Government officials responsible for
the operation about World Bank involvement and the integrated nature of the procurement and
investment programming goals impaired performance.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E): Design

48. The Government designated the Ministry of Finance to coordinate and monitor
implementation under the program and to report progress toward the objectives. Moreover,
the following agencies were in charge of monitoring specific measures: the General Directorate of
Debt and Treasury (DGDT) within the Ministry of Finance (MEF) had the mandate to implement
the measure related to the Treasury Single Account (TSA); the Directorate of Public Investment
(DIP-MPCE) was in charge of the measure related to the issuance of budget execution reports
through SYSGEP; the National Procurement Agency (CNMP) had responsibility for the measures
intended to improve procurement performance (line ministries’ reports of procurement plans to
CNMP); and EDH monitored electricity sector performance indicators (use of meter readings in
its payment of IPP bills and its billing of priority customers). Although sectoral progress was

6
  However, the project team reported to the ICR mission that the Ministry of Public Works was fully aware of the
program because they were overseeing EDH at the time of the appraisal, and the Minister and Deputy minister attended
relevant meetings at which the program reporting were discussed.

                                                        13
monitored directly by the relevant entities involved, they also were supposed to benefit from
indirect monitoring by MEF, a supervision committee headed by MEF was created to facilitate
coordination, and MEF was in charge of reporting progress toward the objectives.

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E): Implementation

49. The implementation of the M&E was very poor, reflecting the lack of ownership, and
absence of clear incentives mechanism, and administrative weaknesses as discussed above.

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E): utilization

50. The ICR mission found no evidence of a robust utilization of the Monitoring and Evaluation
outcome by the government. The ICR team consultations revealed that high ranking official in the
Ministry of Economy and Finance had limited knowledge of key issues impeding the
implementation of the program, and were not very proactive pursuing the objectives of the
program. Most of the actions initiated by the government under the program seem to be in reaction
to a World Bank request or complaints.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

51. The Bank will continue its focus on transparency in its policy dialogue with the
Government of Haiti, and will press for achievement of the targets of this operation.

52. The Government has requested further budget support. The CMU is considering the
new request with interest. However, a new DPO would draw heavily on the lessons learned from
the current program to maintain incentives for performance. Furthermore, as discussed above (see
Section 1.4), Bank’ TA interventions on energy, procurement and governance are expected to
continue.

53. One idea now under discussion is to establish an inter-ministerial committee that would
meet regularly, where each ministry would report on progress in meeting the procurement
targets. This could result in more effective dissemination within the Government of the reform
program, as well as increase the pressure on Ministries that are not performing.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

Rating: Unsatisfactory
54. The operation did encourage some progress. In addition to administrative preparations,
some of the prior actions (completed prior to disbursement) represented substantive policy
improvements, including the closure of government’s idle or dormant bank accounts, publication
of regulations for the 2009 Procurement Law, rescinding of improperly-awarded contracts, and
some improvements in the use of metering by EDH, coupled with settlement of the Central
Government’s FY12 payment delays. Further, progress was made on some of the program targets
after closure of the operation, including the limitation of ministerial bank accounts to three at the
Central Bank, and the submission of procurement plans. Thus, the Bank’s policy dialogue with
the Government continues to encourage policy reform.


                                                 14
55. Nevertheless, administrative weaknesses, the turbulent political environment, and the
difficult nature of the reform program meant that at the time of closure (June 30, 2014), only
one of eight targets had been met. While some of the line ministries (e.g. Health and Education)
have made impressive progress in improving investment programming and procurement, many of
the units established to support these goals are still not functioning properly (note that establishing
these units was a prior action under the operation). At this point it is unclear whether additional
investment in staff capacity and tools (software and hardware) and efforts to maintain installed
capacity could have achieved the desired results without additional incentives/sanctions.
Similarly, attempts to use meters to verify power supply by IPPs and billing of priority customers
have been subject to considerable delay and technical difficulties, evasion and other governance
challenges, and the ultimate success of this program is in doubt.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation (to current country and global
priorities, and Bank assistance strategy):

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

56. The program objectives were relevant, and fully consistent with the Bank’s country
strategy and the overarching goal of poverty reduction. Haiti has long been one of the poorest
countries in the Western Hemisphere. Haiti’s GDP per capita contracted 30 percent between the
1960s and the end of the last decade (IMF, 2010), and the country suffered a devastating
earthquake in 2010 and two destructive hurricanes in 2012. Moreover, Haiti has a record of poor
governance. The country had an overall 2011 CPIA score of 2.9 out of 6.0 and according to the
Bank’s World Wide Governance Indicators, and ranks in the bottom quartile in all measures of
governance. 7 While political instability and poor governance makes Haiti a challenging
environment, supporting economic reform in Haiti can make an appreciable impact on poverty
reduction. The operation was designed to support key goals of the Bank’s country assistance
strategy, including the reconstruction of key infrastructure and promoting inclusive growth. The
operation also targeted important areas of financial management and governance, including cash
management by line ministries, procurement, investment programming, and power supply, where
improvements could make an appreciable contribution to growth.

57. Furthermore, the ICR consultations with stakeholders and interviews of line ministries
revealed an overwhelming adherence to all the objectives pursued by the program in all the
three areas targeted (Table A2-1): PFM, procurement, electrical sector financial performance.
17 out of the 19 lines ministries interviewed reported that they fully adhere to all of the 4 objectives
related to PFM and procurement. 15 of them consider the achievement of PFM as well as
procurement objectives as priority for their ministry and its achievement as potentially useful for
the mission of their ministry. Similarly, the counterpart at the EDH commented to the ICR team
that their institution does adhere fully to the objectives of the program and does consider their
achievement as a top priority.

58. However, these objectives were too ambitious, given the difficult environment, the poor
experience with some counterparts in earlier Bank operations, and the lack of inclusion of
some ministries and agencies whose support was critical for success. In particular, the objective

7
    See the World Bank’s website at: http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/.

                                                          15
that all agencies submit procurement plans by October 31, 2013 was perhaps unrealistic, given that
appraisal was in May 2013. It has been best practice for a number of years to limit the number of
PDO indicators to no more than five, and the operation had eight difficult ones.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives (including brief discussion of causal
linkages between policy actions supported by the operation and outcomes):

Rating: Unsatisfactory

59. The operation did make a contribution to improving transparency and government
administration. The clearance of the government’s arrears with EDH was a first step towards
establishing an arms-length relationship between the government and the electricity company,
which will be essential to ensure financial soundness going forward. The closure of inactive
government accounts at the Central Bank helped to improve financial management. Contracts that
were awarded inappropriately under the emergency law were rescinded. The submission of
procurement plans by line ministries also enhanced information flows to the MEF, contributing to
a more effective budget preparation process. And, although not achieved prior to closure of the
operation, the limitation of ministerial accounts at the Central Bank is a first, essential step towards
establishing a transparent financial management system for cash balances that avoids leakages and
unnecessary borrowing, and is subject to appropriate controls, including audits.

60. Other development goals supported by the operation were less successful. One
important target was to improve the Government’s ability to more effectively track and manage
the investment program, which ultimately would increase the public sector’s contribution to
development. However, many of the units established to monitor investment in the line ministries
are still not operational. Another goal was to ensure that procurement was undertaken through
competitive bidding, essential to limit corruption and increase value for money. However, at this
point the Government does not appear to be able to collect the information required to determine
whether ministries are in compliance. Finally, greater reliance on meters to measure remotely
energy provided by independent power producers was another key development objective. While
all the 6 meters required had been installed nine months after the closing of the program, the slow
progress in repairs and installation, and evasion efforts by some IPPs, calls into question the
development impact of this program.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating (combining relevance, achievement of PDOs):

61. The overall rating is moderately unsatisfactory. Some of the development objectives of
the operation were achieved, particularly in the areas of clearance of arrears, rescinding of
contracts awarded under emergency legislation, publication of procurement regulations,
installation of meters for more than 200 priority customers, and progress towards a Single Treasury
Account. However, the above-mentioned failures in the areas of increasing the use of competitive
bidding, investment programming, and the use of meters in the power sector indicate that most of
the targets of the operation were not achieved.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts (if any, where not previously covered
or to amplify discussion above):


                                                  16
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
NA

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term
capacity and institutional development):

62. The operation was designed to strengthen the institutional capacity of the government
in several respects. Limiting ministerial bank accounts to three at the Central Bank was a major
step towards improving cash management, and this goal was achieved, albeit three months after
closure of the operation. The established units in each line ministry devoted to reporting on
procurement and investment expenditures could have reduced opportunities for corruption,
lowered costs, and strengthened the ability of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Planning
to manage the government’s investment.

63. However, achievement of these goals was limited, as reporting has been piecemeal and
many of the planned investment units are not functioning. Given the continuing, severe
constraint on the quality of human capital in the government, it is not clear that even the progress
made so far is sustainable. The ICR consultations revealed that most of the line ministries and
procurement committees are understaffed, suffer from high turnover, lack adequate equipment and
do not benefit from appropriate collaboration from their own hierarchy or from other
administrations when needed (Table A2-3). The UEPs faced similar constraints (Table A2-4).

64. A first step was taken towards improving the transparency of EDH’s financial
transactions through the clearance of Government arrears. If no new arrears are incurred, and
similar progress is made in rationalizing EDH’s (larger) financial relationship with the
municipalities, this would represent an important step towards improving EDH’s financial
soundness, and thus its ability to provide more electricity to the Haitian people. However, delays
in installation and the malfunctioning and damage of meters calls into question EDH’s ability and
willingness to increase the accuracy of charges for energy provided to EDH by independent power
producers, as well as the accuracy of billing by EDH to priority customers. Therefore, it is not
clear that the steps achieved so far will lead to lasting improvement in management of the power
sector.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative):
NA

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops (optional
for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes):

65. The ICR team conducted extensive and systematic interviews with 19 lines ministries,
focusing on the program indicators related to public financial management and public
procurement. The questionnaire aimed to capture the line ministries’ perception of i) program
objectives, ii) supervision; iii) results achieved, iv) constraints to the program execution, and v)
the role of the World Bank. The key messages are the following (see tables in annex 2):




                                                17
   -   There is a very strong adhesion to the objectives pursued by the program, as between 80
       and 90 percent of respondents (depending on the objective) consider the program as a
       priority, and useful for the country and for their own work.
   -   The line ministries interviewed were not effectively informed about the program. With the
       exception of the ministries that were directly involved in the program (MEF, and MCEP),
       just two other line ministries reported having any knowledge of a World Bank program
       aiming to promote these objectives.
   -   Most of the line ministries did not have direct contact with the Bank team in charge of this
       program, but did have a very positive view of the Bank.
   -   The line ministries considered that the supervision was not properly conducted, and almost
       all of them consider that the MEF and not the World Bank had to play that role. However,
       all 19 ministries reported some activities in recent years aiming to contribute to the
       objectives defined by the program.
   -   Key constraints to the execution of the program objectives include limited staff, instability
       of key staffs, changing policy environment, inadequate technical qualifications
       (particularly for the UEPs), and lack of equipment including computers, software, and even
       office spaces.
   -   The support of the high ranking officials within the ministry is key. The line ministries that
       achieved important results reported a strong ownership of the measures by the Hierarchy
       of the Ministry.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: High risk

66. The risk that development outcomes will not be maintained is high, as the sustainability
of some of the reforms achieved under the program is uncertain. The technical difficulties
involved in the use of meters by EDH continue, stemming from both weak capacity and deliberate
obstruction. Under a separate operation, the Bank will continue to work with EDH to install meters
and to ensure that they are working, which should contribute to more accurate billing. However,
it should be recognized that success in this area has so far been limited.

67. Similarly, the establishment of units to monitor public investment has had uneven
results. Effective investment tracking is likely to continue in Ministries where this reform has
been aggressively implemented. However, there is little indication that the reform has had much
impact in most Ministries. Without stronger ownership and enforcement efforts at the central
ministries (i.e., MEF and Ministry of Planning/DIP) – and without adequate training and resources
– the transparency of budget expenditures and within-government information flows are unlikely
to improve significantly, hampering potential improvements in future budget planning. And with
respect to procurement reporting and approvals, the fact that CNMP is not empowered to enforce
compliance with procurement rules will inhibit progress in this area. By contrast, the limitation
on ministries’ bank accounts to three at the Central Bank will continue to be monitored under the
IMF program, and has strong support within the government. Thus, absent major political changes
there is every reason to believe that this reform will be sustained.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance (relating to design, implementation and
outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

68. Communications by Bank staff to the Government could have been more proactive.
For example, while Bank staff providing technical assistance objected to the decision by the unit
managing the public investment program not to use the SYSGEP system (a performance target
under the program), it does not appear that the issue was highlighted by the Bank to higher-level
Government officials. More generally, staff supervising the project worked primarily through the
Ministry of Finance, but the Ministry was not always effective in communicating program targets
or enforcing implementation by line ministries. Bank staff had to avoid interfering with the
Ministry’s responsibilities, but could have explored indirect ways to engage with line ministries,
such as through existing sectoral programs or through the technical assistance project intended to
support the PFM reforms.

69. Bank management of the operation was impaired by staff turnover, as three staff
members managed the operation from preparation to closure. The staff member who
conducted the appraisal left the Department shortly after disbursement, and reports no further
project-specific communication with the staff member who took over as task manager. The CMU
and the RVP repeatedly impressed upon the government the need to make greater progress on the
policy actions to strengthen transparency, economic management, and good governance in Haiti.
Many sources (from government and the Bank team) confirmed to the ICR team several efforts by
management to intervene with high ranking officials to push for progress on the program,
including during the CMU’s high-level meetings with the authorities, and during the Annual, and
Spring meetings. However, given the difficult political conditions and lack of government
capacity, perhaps Bank management and the CMU should have intervened more forcefully in
support of team supervision of the project.

70. Bank technical assistance was available to support the adjustment operation. Relevant
technical assistance operations included support for the Directorate of Public Investment and the
establishment of investment programming units, as well as a $90 million investment program with
EDH. However, coordination between staff managing the operation and staff providing technical
assistance could have been improved. Moreover, changes in staff managing the technical
assistance program for the Directorate of Public Investment resulted in some contradictory
messages to the Government. In earlier Bank reports, the team in charge of coordinating TA to the
Directorate of Public Investment seemed to support the government’s decision to change the public
investment planning software from SYSGEP to SID. However, in the March 2015 Bank mission,
the new sector team in charge of the TA on public investment programming stated that SID was
not appropriate for the objective pursued by the program and that the Bank had suspended the
promised support to the DIP to develop the new software.

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through lending phase):

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

                                               19
71. The program addressed key development objectives. Building on progress made under
previous Bank operations in Haiti, the program involved measures that had long been under
discussion with the Government, and was supported by technical assistance. Thus, in many
respects the quality at entry was strong.

72. However, as discussed above, the program was very ambitious, given the difficult
environment (see Section 3.1), while the stand-alone approach provided few incentives for
the government to comply after disbursement. The government lacked the strong capacity for
monitoring and evaluation that would have been necessary to meet these targets. Furthermore,
the project faced major risks owing to administrative weaknesses, political instability and the
difficult environment created by recent natural disasters. Since these were recognized at appraisal,
perhaps more consideration should have been given to disbursing in two tranches, to strengthen
the hand of government officials committed to the program. However, the decision to conduct a
stand-alone operation, rather than a programmatic, operation reflected Bank policies rather than
the preference of the team. The Bank did not want to consider two rounds of budget support, as
the environment was deemed too risky to commit additional resources that would have been
required for a programmatic approach.

73. Several performance indicators targeted in this program have limitations in assessing
progress towards the objectives of the program. For example, the program target for the
clearance of government arrears to EDH focused only on the central government debt, and ignored
the arrears with the regions that are tenfold that of the central government. Furthermore, the
program target on the reporting of public investment execution focused only on domestically-
financed investments, ignoring donor-financed projects. The most important projects in Haiti are
donor funded and their management and monitoring is insured by a special entity, supported by
the World Bank and the IADB, located at the Ministry of Finance. Some counterparts in DIP and
CNMP reported to the ICR their frustration with regard to what they consider to be a double
standard, because donor-funded projects were not being held to the same level of accountability
as domestically-financed projects.

(b) Quality of Supervision (including M&E arrangements):

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

74. Supervision was managed out of the Bank’s resident mission, although supervision
missions involving staff covering different sectors were undertaken in September 2013,
March 2014, and May 2014. Aide memoires were prepared in consultation with the authorities.
The mid-review mission initially scheduled for January took place in March.

75. The Bank team follow-up with the Ministries and other institutions in charge of specific
indicators is rated satisfactory. Government counterparts commented to the ICR mission that
the Bank team was very proactive, and that cooperation was good throughout the implementation
of the program. They credited the Bank team with aggressive supervision that helped achieve
progress in a very difficult political context characterized by political deadlock leading to delays
in budget adoption, and instability in leadership at the MEF (the minister changed three times
during implementation of the program).

                                                20
76. While it is unclear whether a different approach to supervision would have had an
appreciable impact on the achievement of program targets, Bank staff could have explored
ways of indirectly engaging with entities in charge of execution of the measures. That is, most
of the communications to the Government concerning the operation were made directly to the
Ministry of Finance, and other implementing institutions (DIP, CNMP, and EDH), with little
contact between staff supervising the operation and the line ministries responsible for meeting
many of the program targets. Given administrative weaknesses at the Ministry of Finance, it may
have been desirable to undertake more extensive contacts with other Government agencies.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

77. The rating of moderately unsatisfactory reflects the quality of supervision, considered
as proactive and aggressive by the client, and the program design, which relied on the Bank’s
longstanding involvement in public sector management in Haiti and knowledge of the major
impediments to improving transparency and efficiency. This has to be balanced against some
limitations in the communication with the government, defects in coordination between Bank
technical assistance and program objectives, andfailures (at program design ) to create appropriate
incentives for the government to comply.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance:

Rating: Unsatisfactory

78. Government performance also was mixed. Substantial progress was made in key areas
that gained the attention of high government officials, for example improving control over cash
management at line ministries and the clearance of arrears to the power company.

79. However, less success was achieved in areas that required concerted efforts at various
levels of government, for example strengthening procurement, investment programming and
the accuracy of power sector billing. In part this reflected the lack of adequately-trained staff
and resistance by staff that benefited from the lack of transparency. And it must be recognized that
the extremely difficult political environment, coupled with the impact of recent natural disasters
on government capacity, greatly increased the challenges the government faced. Nevertheless, the
program’s limited achievements also were due to the limited communication, coordination and
follow up by responsible officials of the program targets. This reflected a lack of ownership of,
and commitment to, some of the reform objectives, as witnessed by the change from SYSGEP to
SID by a key implementing institution.

80. The DIP’s decision to Schiff from SYSGEP to SID after the appraisal was an important
reason why the target on investment reporting was not met. The DIP action showed a clear
lack of ownership and commitment to this program objective, which also might have affected their
motivation to mobilize other ministries to improve reporting on the execution of the investment
program. Furthermore, the absence of a minister at the Planning Ministry during program
implementation reduced the ability of Ministry staffs (DIP) to achieve compliance with program
objectives from other ministries.

                                                21
81. Staffing instability in the CNMP hampered the quality of supervision, which has likely
contributed to the failure of other indicators they were charged with monitoring. The CNMP
made important progress in mobilizing line ministries to submit annual procurement plans. Despite
delays in approval of the Government budget, 11 out of 19 ministers submitted procurement plans.
Two additional line ministries submitted their procurement plans with delays. Moreover, the ICR
survey revealed that .4 out of the 6 line ministries that did not submit a plan have no procurement
activities. However, many line ministries interviewed suggest that the CNMP never informed them
on the existence of a program with the World Bank. Moreover, requests that subsequently were
shown to be related to objectives addressed under the Bank program were provided in the form of
routine communications, without attaching any particular priority to their achievement.


(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance:

NA

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance:

As discussed above.

6. Lessons Learned (both operation-specific and of wide general application)

82. A programmatic approach may have been more appropriate in the context of Haiti to
ensure greater commitment and stronger implementation, stand-alone operations fail to
provide sufficient incentive to meet program objectives. This operation was designed to support
government-wide administrative improvements in the context of weak administration, political
instability, and resistance to reform at some administrative levels. Although the program and
accompanying TA were intended to overcome this and create adequate incentives for
implementing reform, they proved inadequate. In this context, reliance on a stand-alone
operation, with no disbursement based on the fulfillment of program objectives other than prior
actions, limited the ability of committed officials to press for the achievement of program
objectives.

83. Program design for post-disaster development policy loans should pay great attention
to capacity limitations. It would be desirable to perform a stock-taking of available capacity to
implement an adjustment program and the nature of the major constraints, to avoid poor
implementation. At the same time, concern over the continuing impact of the disaster on the
government and implementing agencies should limit the ambition of the program. It is preferable
to redesign the operation at appraisal, if necessary, rather than present a high-risk, complex
operation to the Board.


84. Another issue concerns the degree of involvement of the Bank in government
operations. Supervision of the operation largely involved direct communications with the
Ministry of Finance. Unfortunately, the administration’s communication of program requirements
to the line ministries was seriously flawed. A more concerted effort by the Bank to encourage the
dissemination of information within the Government could have avoided some failures to meet

                                                22
objectives, although this might have represented an excessive intrusion into Government’s internal
affairs. Balancing these two concerns in the Haitian context will remain a major challenge.

85. The need for strong and better coordinated technical assistance is essential. The
importance of cooperation between the units managing technical assistance operations and those
managing an adjustment operation is critical for the success of future program. Perhaps some
stronger linkages between these functions may be considered in countries where the risks facing
adjustment operations are particularly high.

86. Evaluation and monitoring of the program should be a shared responsibility. The design of
the evaluation and monitoring mechanism should be discussed and agreed with the government
before the appraisal. Supervising the implementation should be a shared responsibility between
the Bank and the government; and important changes in the government monitoring team (and
vice versa) should be discussed with the Bank.

87. Understanding the drivers of political economy is critical to the success of any program of
reform. Persistent corruption and the power of entrenched interests represent a very difficult
environment for meaningful reforms, despite the presence of reform champions. Setting up
incentive mechanisms, including by helping civil society to be involved could increase the
likelihood of the success and open the way for future programmatic budget support operations.

88. Coordination with other donors is key. Even if the measures targeted by this program were
part of the joint donor matrix, they were not systematically coordinated with all donors. For
example, the decision of the Directorate of Public Investment to change the public investment
planning software from SYSGEP to SID relied on the recommendations from an assessment
conducted by the French Development Agency. One recommendation going forward is for donors
to better coordinate the choice of measures in their budget support programs (rather than the
current practice of having each donor choose unilaterally one measure to support), in order to
increase the incentive for the government to cooperate. For example, the progress made on the
objective of reducing the number of bank accounts of each line ministry at the central bank was
largely due to the fact that the IMF program included measures that were very complementary to
those pursued under this DPO.

(iii) Improving the governance and financial performance of the electricity sector.

   A. Progress made with achievement of the measures agreed upon in the context of the H08-
      0-HT grant

   1. With regard to strengthening the public investment monitoring system in order to
      enhance transparency and accountability by June 2014, the Public Investment Directorate
      was supposed to publish quarterly budget execution reports using the SYSGEP system. These
      reports were supposed to provide precise information on the public investments financed with
      domestic resources beyond the commitment phase and to cover every line ministry and
      project. (Target not achieved)

    Despite the failure to achieve this measure in the context of the program, the Government is
seeking at the same time to take several bold actions to sustainably improve the public investment
management system, with the ultimate goal of guaranteeing quality public services and satisfying the
many needs of citizens through the more effective and efficient use of scant public resources. By
gradually reestablishing a more appropriate and better applied organizational and regulatory
framework, more modern methods and procedures, as well as tools and human resources that are
more suited to managing the public investment programs and projects, the proposed action plan is
also seeking to restore the Haitian public administration’s main function of leading the national
development process which, in recent decades, had been relegated to external public and private
actors. To this end, a list of relevant activities has been identified with a view to enhancing the
performance of the public investment management system.

         The modernization of the public investment management system will entail strengthening
the main activities of the Ministry of Planning and External Cooperation (MPCE), the Ministry of
Economy and Finance (MEF), and the line ministries, either with national or international technical
assistance, training, tools, and equipment. It will also call for reforms that are as simple as the actual
enforcement of laws and regulations already in effect, which are intended to facilitate programming
as well as the execution, monitoring, and oversight of projects.

    In order to strengthen strategic and operational planning, an effort will be made to step up
work in the MPCE related to the preparation of 2015-2016 Public Investment Plan (PIP) and the
2017-2019 three-year Investment Plan (PTI). To prepare the 2015-2016 PIP, a number of immediate
measures are recommended in the plan that do not require any technical assistance or special training
but will signal to both internal and external stakeholders that long-term changes are being made to
                                                   32
the system, while restoring the minimum procedures required for the orderly establishment and
execution of the PIP. These measures relate, in particular, to the requirement that all projects listed
in the PIP have adequate documentation (project document and project identification and operation
form (FIOP), etc.), as provided for by the regulations in effect, as well as observance of the
preparation schedule by the units concerned both in the MPCE and the line ministries.

    The 2017-2019 PTI is intended to support the MPCE through technical assistance and training
to modernize and develop methods, procedures, and tools, with a view to better preparation of the
programs and projects.

     At the same time, large-scale activities will be started by the Programming and Analysis Units
(UEPs) in six main line ministries in order to promote better sectoral planning and more effective
participation by these ministries in the programming and execution of the 2015-2016 PIP and 2017-
2019 PTI, in line with enhancement activities that will be undertaken by the MPCE, and to ensure
that project evaluation capacities and methods become firmly established in all MPCE central
entities and UEPs.

     With regard to MEF project execution and monitoring, capacity-building activities will focus
on the speedy establishment of a project accounting system so as to ensure thorough monitoring of
the financial execution of projects and to minimize the major fiduciary risks currently faced, and on
the streamlining and simplification of expenditure and public procurement procedures (related
to the National Procurement Agency (CNMP), in order to facilitate the financial execution of
projects. At the same time, the plan provides for the restoration of the MPCE’s capacity for the
effective physical and financial monitoring of projects by strengthening the DSE and gradually
implementing the Development Information System (SID).

   2. Strengthening cash flow management systems in order to enhance accountability and
      efficiency by June 2014. The number of bank accounts for each line ministry has been
      reduced to three, with all these accounts being held with the Central Bank of Haiti (Banque
      de la République d’Haiti)—an operational current account, an investment account, and a
      revenue account. This outcome represents a key step in paving the way for establishment of
      the Treasury Single Account (CUT) (Target achieved).

    Establishment of the Treasury Single Account is a public finance reform measure undertaken by
the Haitian State in the early 2000s. An assessment of the system in late 2011 revealed a total of 872
current accounts, 607 of which were gourde-denominated and 265, dollar-denominated, held solely
by the ministries and autonomous entities, with the exception of the accounts with donor funds and
those held by public enterprises. A number of coordinated actions were undertaken to facilitate
implementation of the Treasury Single Account in the Treasury Directorate, with the aim of
streamlining the management of public funds and unifying the banking structure. Broken down into
three phases, the first entails:

   − Grouping accounts in threes by entity—an operating account, an investment account, and a
     revenue account for their own funds.
   − Closing all the accounts not retained by the Treasury Single Account, with the exception of
     the special accounts and accounts opened at the request of donors.
   − Periodic reconciliation of the revenue accounts with the Treasury Central Account (CCT).
   − Placement of all CUT accounts under the supervision of government accountants.

                                                  33
   − Awareness-raising among sectors of the need to keep accounting records for the different
     funds.
The actions taken have facilitated:

   − A significant reduction in the number of bank accounts (central government and autonomous
     entities)—from 872 in 2011 to 408 in 2015.
   − Closing of 305 accounts between January 2014 and February 2015
   − Transition to a maximum of three accounts for central government entities
   − Audit by Treasury Accountants of the accounts of government entities
   − Opening, in May 2013, of the Treasury Central Account and the revenue accounts of
     collection entities
   − Awareness-raising among the sectors regarding the different measures and the need to keep
     separate accounting records for the management of funds
   − Signing, in July 2013, of the draft agreement between the Central Bank of Haiti and the
     Treasury on the management of the Treasury Single Account and government cash flow, as
     well as the operating procedures for the Treasury Single Account
The Second Phase of the Treasury Single Account
Actions:

   −   Transition from current accounts to expenditure and revenue subaccounts
   −   Data sheet submitted to the Central Bank of Haiti, finalization pending
   −   Monthly tracking of the level of account activity
   −   Categorization of dollar-denominated accounts (central government, special accounts, public
       enterprises, and donors or non-monetary financial institutions) with a view to changing them
       to subaccounts
   −   Online access by the MEF in order to view the balances of all government accounts held with
       the Central Bank of Haiti
   −   GL accounting of investment expenditures
   −   Assessment of SYSDEP and SYSCOMPTE
   −   Operationalization of the SYSCOMPTE system under way in order to meet the needs of the
       management structure of public investment accounts with a view to its extension to all
       accounting items
   −   Institution of payment via banking channels (May 2015)

    This strategic framework can be analyzed from three angles, namely (i) the strengthening of the
basic functions related to public finance management, which seeks to bolster the essential functions
and ensure proper functioning of the public finance system, (ii) the legal and technical environment
needed to modernize public finance management so that it can provide the legal, regulatory, physical,
and technical framework capable of supporting future improvements, and lastly (iii) the
modernization of public finance management practices, which will facilitate the introduction of
performance-based budgeting, stepped-up internal and external auditing, and lastly, the
deconcentration and decentralization of public finance management, once the foundation for sound
and proper management of the resources has been laid and established.




                                                 34
     The process, which is being supervised by the senior authorities serving on a strategic steering
committee (CPS) chaired by the Minister of Economy and Finance and composed of all the relevant
institutions, will be piloted and monitored by the duly strengthened Reform Commission, as the three-
year action plan has been split into an annual operational plan that will break down actions and
activities into basic tasks to be performed with a view to achieving the desired results. The plan itself
is thus a three-year rolling plan, which means that it will be updated and extended each year. Periodic
reports will be produced and published, and an annual evaluation will be [text missing].

    3. The objective with respect to procurement was to establish a transparent institutional
       framework for public procurement and strengthen capacity to manage supplies and
       procurement. The expected outcomes for 2014 are as follows: (1) At least 66 percent of
       government contracts above the prior review threshold set by the CNMP and signed since
       April 1, 2013, with the exception of Emergency Laws, have been subject to open or limited
       competitive bidding, using standard bidding documents (target not achieved); (2)
       Procurement plans for FY 2013-2014 have been submitted by all procuring ministries by
       October 31, 2013; the ministerial procurement units are submitting quarterly reports to the
       CNMP on all procurement activities in their respective ministries (target not achieved); (3)
       The sum of US$11 million initially earmarked for the five terminated contracts has been
       released for allocation to other investments (target achieved).

    With a view to preparing a transparent institutional framework for public procurement and
building procurement management capacity, the CNMP should ensure that at least two-thirds of
government contracts above the prior review threshold are subject to competition. The desired
outcome was not fully achieved; however, if consideration is given to the number of contracts subject
to competition that have been unsuccessful and for which sole source bidding was requested, the
percentage of direct bid contracts is significantly lower.

     In terms of the preparation of the procurement plan by the ministries, the result is quite
remarkable, because the CNMP succeeded in getting thirteen of them to submit procurement plans
to it in the first year. Those that failed to submit this document have been placed on a list of ministries
that have few contracts with amounts requiring prior review by the CNMP. The requirement that the
public procurement ministerial units submit quarterly reports was only partially met. CNMP efforts
to collect this document have met with mixed results.

   4. The objective in the electricity sector was to improve its governance and financial
      performance, with a view to reducing public transfers from the MEF to the EDH in the years
      ahead. The expected outcomes by June 2014 are as follows: (1) Payments of bills from
      independent supplier-producers are based on production levels measured by remote meters
      and verified by the EDH (partially achieved, three meters were installed. Three others were
      installed but were malfunctioning owing to the intense heat; they are currently being repaired
      in Miami and will be functional within the next four months). (2) Billing of priority
      customers is based on meter readings (partially achieved). The EDH is expected to install 500
      meters for major customers. Only 230 meters have been installed to date. The EDH is putting
      a project worth nine million gourdes in place to install the other meters for major customers
      over the next three months. (3) No new arrears to the EDH for electricity use have been
      accumulated by the central government (target achieved).


   B. Lessons learned from implementation of this program

       − The implementation of this program has helped the country further accelerate the pace of
         reforms aimed at improving public finances.

       − The lack of communication on the reform program limited its ownership by the line
         ministries. Going forward, it would therefore be important to create a component to cover
         visibility and dialogue with the Government, donors, and civil society in order to raise
         awareness about the objectives of this type of program. It is equally important to
         underscore the importance of political dialogue in the implementation process, and make
         provisions to build the capacity of current staff to manage this dialogue and dialogue
         mechanisms (including sectoral) where necessary.

       − Active coordination between partners is critical for optimal and appropriate management
         of external resources.

       − The establishment of a highly strategic committee composed of the Minister of Planning
         and External Cooperation, the CNMP coordinator, the Chief Executive Officer of
         Electricité d’Haïti (EDH), and the prime minister, with a view to provision of the
         necessary instructions, could have contributed to achievement of the agreed reforms.

    The implementation of a multi-tranche budget support credit could generate efficiency and
effectiveness gains in the context of a budget support program for Haiti. Its implementation in a
joint framework could benefit from expertise of other donors on topics to be addressed and better
information on their activities and results, and greater ownership on the part of the Government.
