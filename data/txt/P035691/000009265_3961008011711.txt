MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF KENYA
FOR THE NAIROBI-MOMBASA ROAD REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Republic of Kenya for SDR 34.0 million, the
equivalent of US$50.0 million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to help
finance a Project for the Rehabilitation of the Nairobi-Mombasa Road. The European
Union has indicated interest in providing parallel financing for the reconstruction of the
remaining deteriorated section of the road.
Country Background
2.    Kenya is a low income country, with a GDP per capita estimated in 1994 at $260.
The economy is dominated by the agricultural sector, which accounts for about one-
quarter of GDP. However, Kenya possesses a relatively developed and diversified
industrial sector, which contributes roughly 15 percent to GDP. Kenya's population is
estimated at around 26 million and, in spite of recent declines in fertility, population
growth remains high, in the order of 3 percent a year. Unemployment and poverty remain
serious problems in Kenya, with more than 2 million people unemployed and an estimated
10 million people living in poverty. Addressing these problems is a major challenge, made
more difficult by the high rate of population growth. Because of this, reductions in
unemployment and poverty necessitate high rates of economic growth, in the order of 7-8
percent a year.
3.    The Kenyan economy has not been consistently able to generate the levels of
economic growth needed to reduce unemployment and poverty. After a period of strong
economic growth, averaging about 8 percent a year, in the decade immediately after
independence in 1963, economic growth decelerated as the external environment
worsened and structural weaknesses became more pronounced. During the 1980's,
economic growth averaged only about 4 percent a year. The main structural factors
constraining growth were the increasing burden of public enterprises (whose inefficiency
has been estimated to reduce potential GDP growth by 2 percentage points a year) and
lower producer incentives resulting from Government intervention in product markets,
particularly in the agricultural sector.
4.    In the early 1990s, Kenyan macroeconomic performance deteriorated sharply as
reflected in higher fiscal deficits (equal to 7.9 percent of GDP in FY91) and current
account deficits (equal to 8.1 percent of GDP in 1990). Key to this deterioration was a
breakdown in expenditure control as fiscal discipline weakened significantly in the runup
to the Parliamentary and Presidential elections in late 1992. The fiscal and balance of
payments deficits were fundamentally unsustainable, and led to a large monetary expansion



- 2 -
(and resulting inflation whichi peaked at over 100 percent on an annualized basis during
the second quarter of 1993) and an accumulation of arrears on external payments. On the
structural side, the Government reimposed a ban on maize movements, reversing one of
the key structural reforms in the agricultural area. These developments, together with
dissatisfaction with thie slow pace of political reform, led donors to suspend balance of
payments support and freeze new project lendinig.
5.    The Government eventullay reached ag,reement with the IMF and IDA in April
19931 on an action plan to redress the situation. As part of this plan, monetary policy was
tightened resulting '.n sharply higher- nominal interest rates and the exchange rate was
successively devalued. This paved the way for negotiation of a new Policy Framework
Paper and associated ESAF arrangemnent in the Fall of 1993, which have provided the
context for policy reforms pursued over tle last two years. Substantial progress has been
made un-der this program. Budget deficits have been sharply reduced (to a level of 2.5
percent of GDP, exclusive of grants, in FY95), quantitative restrictions on imports and
exports were eliminated (except for a few prodUcts controlled for health or environmental
reasons), exchange controls abolishied and the exchange rate floated, price controls
eliminated and reforrns of the public enterprises and civil service initiated. The economy
has responded positively to these developments, with real growth in 1994 of just under 4
percent after three years of effectivz stagnation. and growthi this year projected at around
5 percent. Inflation has fallen to less than 3 percent on an annualized basis and the current
accouLnt, boosted by higher coffee prices, hlas shiarply improved and resersve levels
increased.
6.    Progress was not uniform thioughi and there have been occasional policy reversals
which have ser-ved to raise doubts about the sustainability of the process. Public enterprise
reform, particularl] the restruicturing of the larger parastatals, proceeded very slowly and
last year the Government intervened extensively in the maize rnarket through periodic
impositionis of quantitative restrictions on imports and large scale maize purchases.
7     Of parLicuiar concern lias been the Government's commitment to improved
budgetary allocations and control. Much of the fiscal indiscipline in recent years is
attributed to large unbudgeted expenditur-es. Government's comnritmelnt to improved
expenditure control and adherence to budgetary priorities was brought into question by
the announcement that a turnkey contract had been signed for an international airport at
Eldoret whichi had not been originally budgeted. This, together with IDA's insistence that
the Government demonstrate its co7mmitrmient to adequate road maintenance funding, led
IDA to delay submission of'the proposed project.
8.    However-, over recent months the Government has undertaken a number of
positive actions. These include a decision to no loiiger guarantee a maize floor price and
to commercialize the maize marketing parastatal, and to scale back the airport investment.
In addition, the Government has re-allocated funding for road maintenance in accordance
with its agreement with IDA. The Government has also been in active discussion with the
Fund and iDA on a ne"w program of reforms which could be supported by a new ESAF



- 3 -
arrangement and a structural adjustment credit. On the basis of these developments and
the importance of the road rehabilitation, we propose proceeding with the project at this
time.
9.    Kenya is capable of generating the high rates of growth needed to reduce poverty
and unemployment but this will require pursuit of improved economic policies over an
extended period of time. The efforts taken over the last two years represent a significant
step forward, the fruits of which are already evident. However, the progress to date
remains fragile and reforms must be sustained and deepened if poverty is to be reduced.
Through its activities, IDA has sought to support the Government in achieving this
objective while recognizing that the success of this effort depends ultimately on the
Government's own sustained efforts. Accordingly, IDA lending to Kenya has fluctuated
significantly, responding to perceived Government commitment to a program of economic
reform. From an IDA commitment level of over $300 million in FY92, IDA lending fell
sharply to only $65 million per year in FY 94 and 95. Improving economic policies over
the last two years has enabled IDA to move forward on a number of new operations;
however, the extent and timing of IDA support will depend upon the Government's
demonstrated commitment to economic reforms. A Country Assistance Strategy for
Kenya is at an advanced stage of preparation and will be presented to the Board for
consideration early in 1996.
Sector Background
10.   Road transport dominates the transport sector in Kenya, accounting for over 70
percent of tonne-kms (excluding pipeline traffic) and over 90 percent of passenger-kms.
Since Independence, the Government has invested heavily in extending and upgrading the
road network; the network of paved roads has increased from less than 2,000 km at
Independence to over 8,600 km. The classified road network now totals 63,100 km and
there are also approximately 85,000 km of urban streets, unclassified roads and tracks. A
very high proportion of the total traffic flow (over 80 percent) is concentrated on the
trunk and primary roads (about 20 percent of the classified network).
11.   The coverage of Kenya's road network is generally adequate, but its condition is
deteriorating. A recent assessment identified road conditions as a significant constraint to
private sector development and less than a third of the paved network is now classified as
in good condition. The causes of the deterioration - inadequate road maintenance, vehicle
overloading and sometimes inadequate design/construction - are neither unique to Kenya
nor of recent origin. The road maintenance issue was recognized in the late 1970's but the
real level of road maintenance funding continued to decline, eventually financing less than
30 percent of maintenance needs. The road sector is now further from a position of
maintenance sustainability than at the start of the First Highway Sector Project in 1979.
12.   Action has been initiated to reverse this downward trend. The Government has
established a Road Maintenance Levy Fund which is financed by a levy on automotive
fuels and charges on transit vehicles. Agreement has been reached with the Government



- 4 -
on a schedule for increasing funding from at least 50 percent in FY96 to full maintenance
funding by FY2000. The Ministry of Public Works and Housing (MOPWH) has defined a
Strategic Plan for the Road Sector which allocates expenditure in priority from
maintenance, rehabilitation, upgrading to new construction based on economic returns to
the expenditure, defines a rural roads improvement and maintenance strategy which is
adapted to Kenya's resource endowment and financial situation and provides the policy
framework necessary to ensure the effective implementation of these priorities including
increased involvement of the private sector in road maintenance. IDA is now in the
process of preparing a Third Highway Sector Project to support the implementation of the
Strategy, with appraisal of the project expected in 1996. MOPWH has also initiated a
major review of the institutional framework within which the road network is managed.
Project Rationale
13.   A sustainable road sector, which provides for cost-effective road transport, is
essential for the social and economic development of Kenya. The basis for sustainability is
being built with increased road maintenance funding and more defined expenditure
priorities but substantial assistance is required to help overcome the legacy of past
under-maintenance and substantially increased traffic. Deterioration on sections of the
500 km Nairobi-Mombasa road, the crucial transport link to the sea, has become so severe
that serious constraints to transport operations have emerged. In view of the very urgent
need for major remedial action, agreement was reached with the Delegation of the
European Commission and GOK, in early 1993, on the need for the comprehensive
rehabilitation of the road prior to the completion of the full sector strategy, since
safeguarding operations along the Nairobi-Mombasa Road would receive the highest
priority in any realistic strategy for the road sector. The present road was constructed
during the 1960's and early 1970's to design standards based on Kenya Railways carrying
most long distance bulk freight. Since its construction, the road has carried much heavier
traffic than was anticipated; transit traffic shifted to road transport during the 1970's and
long distance domestic traffic moved to road during the 1980's and early 1990's. The road
has become the primary freight route in Kenya and annually carries well over 3.5 million
tonnes. The road also provides the landlocked regions of Eastern Africa (Uganda,
Rwanda, Burundi, eastern Zaire and southern Sudan) with access to the sea.
14.   The road has been resealed, some sections have been overlaid and one section,
Machakos Turn-off - Ulu, was reconstructed as part of the IDA assisted Second Highway
Sector Project. There has not, however, been a comprehensive program to provide the
geometric standards and pavement strength required for present traffic. The design life of
the road has been exceeded, much of the pavement has been eroded to 5.5 meters, and
major failures are occurring. MOPWH is maintaining the road through patching and
resealing but the engineering life and effectiveness of these interventions are very limited.
The option of providing a 5 cm overlay on the existing pavement was considered but
without major rehabilitation and strengthening, conditions will deteriorate further and will
impose a major constraint to development in Kenya and Eastern Africa. Successful
restructuring of Kenya Railways should increase capacity on the parallel rail route but



- 5 -
heavy freight traffic, estimated at over 2.5 million tonnes, will continue to use the road and
its improvement will remain essential.
15.   Increased road maintenance funding is critical but the funds must be allocated
efficiently and the maintenance work implemented in the most productive manner.
Improvements to the existing road management database and planning systems are needed
to complement the increased funding. Periodic road maintenance (resealing and
regravelling) is already almost entirely contracted to the private sector but routine
maintenance (pothole and shoulder repairs, culvert cleaning, grading etc.) is still
undertaken by MOPWH force account units. MOPWH recognizes that the private sector
could potentially provide cost effective routine, as well as periodic, road maintenance but
would like its practicality and effectiveness demonstrated in the Kenyan environment
before making fundamental policy changes.
Project Objectives and Outcomes
16.   The key objectives of the project are: (a) to rehabilitate, widen and strengthen
Kenya's primary transport link between Nairobi and the port of Mombasa; (b) to help
MOPWH determine the most cost-effective delivery option for routine road maintenance
through a pilot program of routine maintenance contracts, independently monitored and
assessed within a structured learning framework; and (c) to strengthen maintenance
financing, planning, execution, inspection and monitoring. The Government's strategy for
the road sector is outlined in the Government's Letter of Sector Policy, presented in
Annex 8 of the SAR.
17.   The main outcomes of the project, when completed, will include: (i) substantially
improved operating conditions on the Nairobi-Mombasa road, lower vehicle operating
costs and a reduction in the accident rate on the road; (ii) increased private sector
involvement in road maintenance activities; (iii) more efficient and rational allocation of
maintenance funding; (iv) improved control and more cost-effective utilization of
maintenance funds; and, (v) improved accountability and transparency in the use of
maintenance funds.
Project Description
18.   Nairobi-Mombasa Road Rehabilitation (US$111.6 million, including the
equivalent of US$10.0 million in local costs from GOK and an equivalent of US$58.8
million which is expected to be financed by the EU): The component will reconstruct or
widen/strengthen the most critical sections of the Nairobi-Mombasa road, a total of 285
km. IDA would assist GOK with the strengthening and widening (to 7 meters with 2-
meter shoulders) of the Mtito Andei - Bachuma Gate section (155 km). The detailed
design for this section was prepared by the Design Branch of MOPWH and subjected to
an independent design and risk review. No re-alignment of the road is proposed but some
short sections, totaling 3.5 kmn, will be raised by 0.5 - 1.0 meter. The EU is presently
funding the feasibility and detailed design for the reconstruction of the Sultan Hamud -



- 6 -
Mtito Andei section (135 km) of the road, and it is expected that project financing will
follow the completion of the feasibility study and design. In the unlikely event that such
financing is not forthcoming, the section would be included in the proposed Third
Highway Sector Project. GOK is already funding remedial works on a further 26 km of
the road. The remaining 190 km of the route is in fair condition and presently only
requires adequate, well-executed maintenance.
19.   Road Maintenance Strengthening (US$6.7 million, including the equivalent of
US$3.1 million from GOK): The component will finance routine maintenance contracts,
totaling 374 km, on five sections of the Northern Corridor, including one contract on the
Nairobi-Mombasa section. Three of the sections will be contracted to the private sector,
and two sections to resealing units of MOPWH. The pilot contracts will be closely
monitored within a framework of "structured learning" by an independent research
institution to assess the impact of private sector contracting on the quality, quantity, and
cost of work performed as well as to determine the most appropriate form of contracting
arrangement. The initial contracts will be awarded for two years. The results of the
structured learning will then be used to fine-tune the arrangements for a second phase of
two-year contracts. The development of the contracts and the recruitment of the
structured learning consultants have been initiated under PPF financing.
20.   Institutional Support (US$3.7 million): The component will provide assistance to
MOPWH to establish a Road Works Inspectorate within the Roads Department to
undertake performance auditing of the Department's activities. In addition, the component
will update the road inventory and condition database, revise and rationalize MOPWH's
maintenance management systems in the light of the Roads 2000 labor-based approach to
maintenance of the unpaved road network, and provide assistance for the preparation of
fiiture projects. The component envisages a twinning arrangement with an external road
agency as the primary vehicle for the provision of support for both the Road Works
Inspectorate and the implementation of the routine maintenance contracts. The
establishment of the Inspectorate is being assisted through PPF funding and its
establishment and appointment of key staff will be conditions of credit effectiveness.
Project Financing
21.   The total project cost is US$122.0 million, based on preliminary cost estimates for
the reconstruction of the Sultan Hamud - Mtito Andei section. Foreign costs total
US$96.5 million and local costs are US$25.5 million. The IDA credit of US$50.0 million
represents 41 percent of the estimated total project costs, net of taxes and duties. The
Government's contribution will be US$13.2 million as counterpart funding for the IDA
assisted components. The EU is expected to provide 100 percent of the costs for the
reconstruction of the Sultan Hamud - Mtito Andei section. A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown at Schedule A. The economic and financial analysis tables and
key performance indicators are shown in Schedule B. The procurement and disbursement
profiles are shown in Schedule C. A timetable of key project processing events and the
Status of Bank Group operations in Kenya are given in Schedules D and E, respectively.

More detailed information is provided in Staff Appraisal Report No. 13798-KE. A map is
also attached.
Project Implementation
22.   The project will be implemented by the Roads Department of the MOPWH. The
Roads Department has already implemented 12 Bank-financed projects and is thus familiar
with Bank procedures and requirements. The Credit is scheduled to be effective in the
third quarter of FY96 and will take six years to complete. The main component of the
IDA credit, the strengthening/widening of the Mtito Andei - Bachuma Gate section, will
be implemented by a large contractor supervised by engineering consultants. Kenya has
relatively well developed construction and engineering consultancy sectors and
locally-based companies were awarded many of the contracts let under the IDA assisted
Second Highway Sector Project. The Roads Department will be assisted in the
implementation of the routine maintenance contracting and Road Works Inspectorate
components by a Twinning road agency already experienced in such activities. The
Twinning agency will not only provide short-term expertise in Kenya but will also train
Road Department engineers in the agency's home country.
Lessons from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement
23.   The Bank has assisted Kenya in the Roads sector since the early 1960's. After the
completion of eight road projects, the First Highway Sector Project was approved in 1979
(Ln. 1684-KE). The Second Highway Sector Project (Ln. 2409/SF017-KE) was
approved in 1983 and was closed at the end of 1992. The Project Completion Report for
the First Sector Project stated that the project did not meet all its objectives as a result of
inadequate counterpart funds, lack of implementation capacity, and inappropriate project
selection criteria and technical standards. The Second Highway Sector Project
experienced many of the same difficulties. While the individual components were
successfully implemented (after the project was restructured), the condition of the overall
network declined as no significant progress was achieved toward securing sufficient
domestic funding for adequate maintenance of the road network.
24.   Demonstrated Government commitment to increasing the road maintenance
funding to adequate levels has been central to the preparation of this and other proposed
projects in the road sector. The establishment of the Road Maintenance Levy Fund and
the commitments of GOK in its Macro-economic and Structural Policy Framework 1995-
97 document, submitted to the Consultative Group Meeting in December 1994, for
increased maintenance funding indicate that progress has been achieved. Further support
for the sector will be conditional on the progress being sustained. The introduction of the
Roads Works Inspectorate and MOPWH's agreement to prepare annual reports on
maintenance and the operations of the Maintenance Levy Fund will help ensure that there
is a transparent and accountable framework for the increased maintenance funding.



-8-
Rationale for IDA Involvement
25.   IDA's participation in both this project and the proposed Third Highway Sector
Project is critical for the accomplishment of the difficult policy reform measures that are
needed to establish an efficient and sustainable program for the rehabilitation and
maintenance of Kenya's road network. The Project is consistent with the Country
Assistance Strategy discussed by the Executive Directors on April 5, 1994. The
rehabilitation of the Nairobi-Mombasa road, Kenya's primary link between the main
production centers and the port of Mombasa, is an essential condition for achieving the
Country Assistance Strategy objective of stimulating economic growth through the
development of an export-oriented private sector. The project will also promote the
Country Assistance Strategy through increasing the role of the private sector in road
maintenance and helping to ensure cost-effective maintenance of basic infrastructure which
is a critical function of Government. The problems of the road sector fall within the
mainstream of the Bank's dialogue with the Government: more productive use of
government resources, civil service reform, increased reliance on the private sector, and
greater accountability. It is also becoming increasingly apparent that, unless major
improvements are made, transport conditions will become an increasing constraint to
economic growth and development.
Agreed Actions
26.   The following have been agreed: (i) the reporting schedule for the maintenance
monitoring; (ii) the carrying out of a mid-term review by December 31, 1998; and (iii) a
detailed annual maintenance funding plan, consistent with the undertaking by the
Government to raise domestic funding for road maintenance to 50% of maintenance needs
in FY96 and to full funding by the year 2000. The Government has submitted to IDA a
satisfactory Letter of Sector Policy included in the Staff Appraisal Report which describes
overall road sector policies, strategies, investment priorities as well as the time frame for
taking key actions, and a satisfactory draft of the Strategic Plan.
27.   Credit effectiveness would be conditional on Cabinet approval of the Strategic
Plan for the Roads Sector, and the effective establishment and staffing of the Road Works
Inspectorate.
Environmental Assessment
28.   This project is classified as Category B, with only a minor impact on the
environment. The project will reconstruct/strengthen an existing paved road, and widen
the pavement to 7 meters, with 2-meter shoulders. The road surface may be raised in a
few, short sections but there will be no significant re-alignments and no resettlement will
be involved. There should be no adverse long term effects on the environment. Special
care will be taken during the execution of road works and maintenance to ensure that
environmental hazards, even of short duration, are not created. The IDA component of
the major civil works - the strengthening and widening of the Mtito Andei - Bachuma



- 9 -
Gate road section - has been given particular attention. The road forms part of a transport
corridor, including also the railway and oil pipeline, which separates the Tsavo West and
East National Parks. A full environmental mitigation plan has been prepared in
conjunction with the Kenya Wildlife Service to ensure that construction does not
adversely affect the National Parks. All quarries and borrow pits will be backfilled, no
blasting will be allowed in the Parks, no construction camp or machinery unit will be
located in the Parks, deviations will be watered to reduce dust, special erosion control
measures will be implemented in association with the improved drainage, and close liaison
will be maintained at all times with the Kenya Wildlife Service. Certain accident
blackspots have been identified along the section and special remedial measures are
planned.
Program Objective Categories
29.   The project will contribute to development of the private sector, which has
hitherto been constrained by the poor condition of the roads; it will also, during
implementation, provide increased opportunities for private sector contractors in road
rehabilitation and routine maintenance. In addition, public sector efficiency will be
enhanced through institutional support to MOPWH.
Participatory Approach
30.   The project was identified during preparation of the Strategic Plan and proposed
Third Highway Sector Project. The Strategic Plan has been produced by the Roads
Department with limited assistance from external and local consultants. The Mtito Andei -
Bachuma Gate section was designed by the Design Branch of the Roads Department and
reviewed by Kenyan consultants. The Roads Department prepared the pilot program for
routine maintenance contracting and the outline contracts. Similarly the Road Works
Inspectorate element of institutional support was fully prepared by the MOPWH.
Benefits
31.   The main benefits from the project will be the substantial reduction in present and
future vehicle operating costs along Kenya's main road route. While the project will
initially benefit vehicle owners, the Kenyan road transport industry is highly competitive
and consequently it is expected that the project will result in lower transport rates. The
economic internal rate of return for the widening/strengthening of the Mtito Andei -
Bachuma Gate section is estimated at 43.9 percent with a Net Present Value of US$138.2
million, using a 12 discount rate (see Schedule BI). Underlying these estimates are a
number of engineering and operational assumptions, especially regarding the growth in
traffic and deterioration in operating conditions, based on relatively moderate expectations
for the Kenyan economy and the HDM III road deterioration model. Operating conditions
on the road are already poor, however, and the project generates a First Year Rate of
Return of 20.6 percent, indicating the need for immediate intervention. It is also expected
that there will be some reduction in the severe accident rate, through widening the



- 10 -
carriageway and providing 2 meter shoulders, thus allowing vehicles to park off the
carriageway. In view of the uncertain magnitude of the reduction and the problems
inherent in valuing accident costs, these additional benefits were not quantified.
32.   A full engineering and economic feasibility has not yet been finalized on the
section, Sultan Hamud - Mtito Andei. In view of present operating conditions on this
section, especially during the rainy seasons, a very high economic rate of return is
expected. Preliminary analysis suggests that the economic benefits of reconstructing this
section will be at least as high as for the Mtito Andei - Bachuma Gate section, with a
FYRR of well over 20 percent.
33.   The benefits of the other project components are less easy to quantify but
experience, elsewhere, suggests that private sector contracting can reduce routine
maintenance costs by 20 percent but the precise level is country specific and needs to be
determined through the piloting proposed under the project. The institutional support
component should also generate substantial benefits for the sector, through the
development of improved maintenance planning, implementation and monitoring.
Project Sustainability
34.   The long-term sustainability of any road improvement is largely dependent on
continuing maintenance and, in the past, many road improvements have subsequently
deteriorated through inadequate maintenance. Even without the supporting actions
described below, there is relatively little likelihood that the Nairobi-Mombasa road
rehabilitation would not be sustained as the road is crucial to Kenya and the Government
has always concentrated the available maintenance funding on the core road network. It is
possible, however, that maintenance on the rest of the network would continue to be
inadequate. This project has to be viewed within a changed environment for the road
sector in which: (i) continued donor support is increasingly conditional on the provision of
adequate maintenance funding; (ii) the Government's Sector Strategy places highest
priority on the maintenance and rehabilitation of the existing network; (iii) the internal
constituency for adequate road maintenance, supported by the Road Maintenance
Initiative, is growing rapidly; and, (iv) the importance of the proposed Third Highway
Sector Project which will link assistance directly to the progress toward sustainability in
the sector. In view of the particular importance of this road and the more general changes
in the sector, the project is expected to be sustainable.
Risks
35.   The economic benefits of the strengthening/widening would be significantly
reduced by slower than expected growth in traffic and the diversion of heavy freight traffic
to rail. Even if, however, annual traffic growth was only one percent, and a million tonnes
of freight were to transfer back to Kenya Railways, the EIRR would still be 29.5 percent,
with a FYRR of 12.0 percent. In view of the existing level of traffic and present road
conditions, the robustness of the economic desirability of the proposed investment is not



- 11 -
surprising. The EIRR would be reduced to 12 percent only if simultaneously construction
costs doubled, benefits were halved and the project life was reduced to 10 years. The
rehabilitation works will be undertaken by major contractors and should raise no
implementation problems. It is implausible that construction costs could rise to levels
which would negate the economic feasibility of the project.
36.   Past experience in Kenya suggests that the main risks in the road sector are not
with respect to particular project investments but with the more general failure to provide
adequate funding for road maintenance. Future maintenance should not be an issue for
this high priority project and the Road Maintenance Levy Fund is designed to provide the
solution to the overall funding problem. Despite the Levy fund, there could still be risks
that (a) funds are used ineffectively; and (b) funds are diverted from maintenance to
investment in new roads. The Road Works Inspectorate is designed to reduce, as much as
possible, these risks through transparent performance monitoring and reporting.
Recommendation
37.   I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

Main Assumptions:
Discount rate: 12%
Traffic growth: 6% (GDP growth of 5 - 6%)
Project life: 15 years, no residual value, overlay in year 10
Constant real vehicle cost inputs, full road maintenance with and without project
No generated traffic
Switching Values of Critical Items:
If, simultaneously, construction costs increased by 100%,'o, benefits were reduced to 50%0, and the project
life was reduced to 10 years, the NPV would be reduced to zero
Nature of Benefits:
Vehicle operating cost savings
Passenger time savings
Road maintenance cost savings
Reduction in accident rate (not quantified)
Main Beneficiaries:
Road users - reduced vehicle operating and time costs
Consignees/consignors of freight - the Kenyan trucking sector is very competitive and reduced truck
operating costs will result in lower freight tariffs.
Government - reduced road maintenance costs
Although the detailed design and feasibility study has not been completed, preliminary analysis indicates that the
economic results for the Sultan Hamud - Mtito Andei section will be very similar.
2   Financial analysis of road projects is only undertaken for toll roads. The ratio between financial and economic
costs is very similar for both vehicle operating costs and construction costs, consequently the use of financial
costs would have only a marginal effect on the overall results.

KENYA - IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES
As of September 30, 1995, there were 18 ongoing projects in the Kenya portfolio representing total
commitments, exclusive of cancellations, of $625.4 million. Undisbursed amounts totaled $401.4 million. FY95
disbursements totaling $151.4 rmillion were only slightly below the $168.4 million and $166.8 million
disbursed in FY93 and FY94, respectively. However, the FY95 disbursement ratio (i.e., for investment
operations) of 16.3 percent showed an improvement over the respective FY93 and FY94 ratios of 14.2
percent and 15.4 percent. Disbursements for investment operations during the first quarter of FY96 were
$29.8 million (translating into a disbursement ratio of 6.6 percent).
As of September 30, 1995, four of the 18 ongoing credits were rated (in the course of the FY95 ARPP
exercise) as "problem" projects - all four were carryovers from the FY94 exercise. Since the FY95 ARPP exercise,
one of these projects has been upgraded to "satisfactory" in view of progress made in meeting outstanding policy-
related conditionalities; another project is being restructured; and for the renmaining two projects, action programs
for addressing outstanding issues (procurement in one instance; inadequate budgetary allocations and
noncompliance with financial covenants) have been agreed with the Government. The FY95 experience in
dealing with these problem projects and a number of developments as elaborated below, should result in an
improved FY96 portfolio with supervision inputs (i.e., in terms of supervision staffweeks) similar to the
FY95 average of slightly less than 16 staffweeks per project.
However, Government commitment and owvnership remains critical to timely and efficient project
implementation, including resolution of major implementation problems if and as they arise. To this extent,
IDA will continue its supervision dialogue and follow-up with the Government, especially through the
Resident Mission and the recently established Operations UJnit, on a number of generic implementation
issues and corresponding remedial actions agreed within the CPPR process initiated in August 1994 - the
first such exercise since the October 1990 Country Implementation Review. The major objective of this
exercise was to initiate an ongoing process by which the Borrower would play a greater role in overseeing
and monitoring the portfolio. The primary generic areas for which specific bottlenecks were identified and
dated corrective actions agreed, included (a) provision of adcquate budgetary allocations, (b) more timely
processing and monitoring of drawdowns and replenishments of the Special Accounts (which are centrally
maintained and managed by the Borrower), and (c) timely preparation and auditing of all accounts required
under IDA-financed projects, and subsequent submission of the respective audit reports to IDA. A mini-
CPPR meeting was held in March 1995 (another review was held in July) to follow up on progress since
last August, and further actions and timefra.nes agreed within which to resolve these outstanding issues.
Results have been encouraginig, although mixed. With one exception (noted above), the IDA
portfolio was adequately budgeted in FY95.  In addition, a number of projects have expenrenced
implementation delays resulting from counterpart funding not being released in a timely manner - adequate
and timely project budgetary provisions, including counterpart funds, will therefore continue to be a focus
of supervision attention during the coming year. While improvements in special accounts management and
utilization are being achieved, progress in timely submission of required/overdue audit reports has been
less-than-anticipated. The ongoing dialogue through the CPPR process initiated last year is expected to
facilitate resolution of these problems. Progress will continue to be reviewed periodically and additional
further corrective steps taken, as necessary. In the meantime, the Governrnent has been advised that
unsatisfactory progress in these areas as per agreed benchmarks will result in IDA taking appropriate
remedial actions and could result in delays in future project processing.
