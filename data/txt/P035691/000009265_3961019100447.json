           Project will support Kenya's efforts to rehabilitate\n            and strengthen its main road network. The most immediate\n            objective of the project is to safeguard the only feasible\n            road connection between the port of Mombasa and the main\n            areas of economic activity in Kenya. The condition of the\n            road already causes major operating problems and, if the\n            road continues to deteriorate, severe constraints to\n            Kenya's export-oriented growth strategy will develop.\n            The project will significantly reduce present and future\n            vehicle operating costs, journey times and improve traffic\n            safety. The project will also encourage private sector\n            involvement in the maintenance of infrastructure, strengthen\n            monitoring/control of road maintenance activities and\n            provide basic institutional support for road maintenance\n            planning. The project is designed to reconstruct and\n            strengthen Mombasa road in order to provide economic\n            operating conditions along Kenya's main road link to\n            the sea for a design life of 15 years. The project comprises\n            four main components: 1) reconstruction/strengthening of the\n            Nairobi-Mombasa road, which can be split into six separate\n            sections, each requiring a different level of intervention\n            to safeguard operating conditions; 2) pilot routine\n            maintenance contracts, which will be monitored by an\n            independent research institution within a \"structured\n            learning\" framework; 3) road works inspectorate, which\n            will be located within the Design Branch and will thus be\n            independent of both the paved and unpaved maintenance\n            branches; and 4) institutional support, which will be\n            provided through a twinning arrangement with an external\n            road agency."}, "docdt": "1995-11-08T00:00:00Z"}
