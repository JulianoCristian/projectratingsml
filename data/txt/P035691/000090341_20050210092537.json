The lessons\n            learned indicate that institutional and financial reform,\n            staff reduction and increased use of private contractors\n            were difficult to resolve yet they were key to mitigate\n            against future recurrence of financial problems that\n            contributed to the poor state of the road network. Bank\n            support was critical for success of the reform program. The\n            Bank's choice of the option of including institutional,\n            policy and road maintenance financing reform was a sound\n            one. The poor state of the key transport corridor solicited\n            strong Government's commitment to implement the\n            project. This provided an opportunity to jointly implement\n            some critical institutional/policy changes recognized as\n            important to address underlying fundamental recurring\n            problems of the sector. Packaging of contracts should take\n            into account implementation realities and to effectively\n            deliver a particular task. There is need to include a\n            dedicated financial management function within the project\n            technical team that will be responsible for funds flow,\n            accounting and reporting."}, "docdt": "2005-02-08T00:00:00Z"}
