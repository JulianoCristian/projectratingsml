The project\n            will avoid sensitive and high biodiversity sites, such as\n            National Parks. Avoidance of these areas concerns also the\n            anticipated population influx and human development that may\n            remain after project completion. Changes in water flow and\n            water quality are likely to occur when constructing a\n            hydropower project. It is necessary to measure the existing\n            flows in terms of velocity of the proposed affected stretch\n            of the river. Another consideration is the generation\n            capacity and needs which in turn affect river flows. Water\n            quality affects sedimentation and erosion, various forms of\n            pollution, and changing flora. Sediment loads may increase\n            during construction of hydropower projects, though may\n            decrease during operation due to a reduction flow in\n            reservoirs. Measuring sediment loads during the project may\n            be required. Pollution in the form of fuel, oil, lubricants,\n            and other chemicals need to be controlled and carefully\n            monitored. To mitigate impacts on vegetation, revegetation\n            programs and reforestation programs may be undertaken and\n            should be funded by the project developer after\n            construction. A baseline study of wildlife will be\n            undertaken if the project disturbs fauna."}, "docdt": "2002-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
