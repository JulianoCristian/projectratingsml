The upgrading also aims to\n            providing a reliable source of electricity in a sustainable\n            and environmentally acceptable manner. There is no\n            resettlement in the project area. No settlements or\n            buildings are located in the direct impact zone. However,\n            since some agricultural land will be inundated, relocation\n            of households depend on this land (owned by the hospital but\n            used by staff for gardens) may chose to move closer to their\n            new fields. Further clarification of this issue is necessary\n            but it is not expected that more than a few households may\n            choose to relocate. However, for distribution of power to\n            neighboring communities there is likelihood of temporary\n            displacement/land take to make way for powerlines. Part of\n            the skilled workforce will be imported as not all required\n            labor can be met in the project area. Dam construction\n            enlarging the canals and other activities will result in\n            some minor changes in topography and other landscape\n            characteristics. The generation of a reliable supply of\n            electricity in Kisiizi will have enormous positive benefits\n            for the region. However, it is necessary to ensure that\n            benefits also reach affected communities and they do not\n            lose out on any development opportunities."}, "docdt": "2006-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
