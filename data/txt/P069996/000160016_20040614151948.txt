33KV POWER LINE FOR ARUA-NEBBI
(Contract UEB232/472/01)
GUIDELINES FOR PAYMENT OF COMPENSATION
(Prepared by NEK Consults Ltd and Spencon Services Ltd)
SEPTEMBER 2003
1



1.0   Introduction
The process of compensating the PAPs will involve different players including the
Central Government, Local Government and the Contractor who will be responsible for
the actual payment. It will require maximum transparency and a high degree of
accountability for the large amount of funds to be paid out.
MEMD decided to make the contractor responsible for the payment of the PAPs because
he was conversant with the area and was in daily contact with the local government and
the PAPs in both Nebbi and Arua Districts.
1.0 Survey, Valuation assessments for compensation
The Uganda Electricity Transmission company Limited (UETCL) surveyed the route of
the line between July and August 2002. Then, later in 2003 the MEMD contracted
NEK Consults to document the impact of the power line on private property and give
recommendations on the compensation procedure, thus deliver an Abbreviated
Resettlement Action Plan. The Consultant used the rates from the Chief Government
Valuer's office, in the Ministry of Water, Lands and Environment to value the property of
the affected people. Also the World Bank guidelines on Involuntary Resettlement were
followed. Only property that was out side the road reserve was considered, since that
within the road reserve had been compensated for during the road construction. A list of
ownership was compiled and the respective value of the affected property computed.
(See Annex 2)
3.0   Verification and Compensation committee (VCC)
In order to ensure that payment is done appropriately, compensation committees will be
set up. The committees will comprise of a representative from MEMD, the District Land
Officer and the LC I Chairperson of the village. The committee sits at the local council
Village level to verify the affected persons listed during the time of the compensation.
The identification is done basing on LC I identification, Field assessment form entries
and any other relevant document that the person submits to the compensation committee.
4.0   Compensation committee's Roles
a)    Role of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development (Government)
The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development shall publicize the schedule of
the Compensation committee's meetings over Radio Uganda and other FM Radio
stations that cover the two districts, in the appropriate local languages and in
English. The Ministry shall also remind the LC III about the schedule of the
compensation meetings in writing.
The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development shall also be responsible for
the co-ordination of the whole exercise and will chair the compensation
committee meetings. It will be responsible for co-ordinating all activities at the
