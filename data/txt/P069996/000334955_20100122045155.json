Transformation (ERT) Project for Uganda were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: a clear lesson emerging from phase one of\n            the ERT is the need to undertake a careful assessment of the\n            potential for private sector investment in rural energy/\n            renewable energy, including identifying barriers, needed\n            incentives, and/or risk mitigation measures to enhance this\n            potential. Participation of the private sector in phase one\n            in renewable energy power generation for sale to the grid\n            was satisfactory but was poor in access projects via\n            main-grid extension, the project's largest investment\n            component. Project design needs to take into account\n            existing capacities of all ministries and public agencies\n            involved in implementation, including at the community\n            level; training and capacity building also need to be\n            provided to operate and maintain projects. Having a\n            field-based member in the Bank's supervision team,\n            speaking the local language with a detailed knowledge of the\n            country's rural areas, is effective and helpful in\n            project implementation, especially for dealing with issues\n            on a real-time basis. It is also helpful in ensuring that\n            the Bank team has a close relationship with the many\n            stakeholders in a project of this kind. The complex\n            procurement packages required seasoned Bank project\n            procurement staff to be in place during project preparation\n            rather than later in the project implementation period.\n            Currently, there is limited supply of long-term development\n            finance (on terms beyond five years), due to the mismatch\n            between the requirements of long-term lending, and the time\n            profile of commercial banks liabilities. This constraint\n            needs to be rectified. Uganda also needs to develop further\n            strategies to attract more foreign investment for rural energy."}, "docdt": "2009-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
