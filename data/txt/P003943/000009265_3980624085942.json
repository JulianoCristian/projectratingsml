Lessons\n            learned includes: 1) East Java Bali (EJB) made a signal\n            contribution in operational zing the decentralization\n            objectives of Government of Indonesia (GOI's) urban\n            policy statement. The Integrated Urban Infrastructure\n            Development Programming (IUIDP) approach was a major\n            departure from earlier sectoral approaches to addressing\n            urban infrastructure services. It recognized that urban\n            management is necessarily multi-sectoral and complex, and\n            attempted to get urban managers to prepare Medium-Term (five\n            years) Investment Program (PJMs) for urban infrastructure\n            sectors by allocating the available limited resources\n            optimally between sectors. In practice, while integrated\n            planning made a good start at the global level, at the\n            detail level planning remained sectoral; and 2) water supply\n            presents an interesting special case. Now that the\n            decentralization of investment programs from Cipta Karya to\n            the Local Government Water Enterprise (PDAMs) has largely\n            been achieved through EJB, it is time to focus on the major\n            reform agenda for the sector to improve service delivery -\n            institutional changes, financing options, private sector\n            participation outlined in the 1997 Bank paper and adopted by GOI."}, "docdt": "1998-03-25T00:00:00Z"}
