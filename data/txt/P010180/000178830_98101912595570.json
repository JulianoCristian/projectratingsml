existing forest\n            plantations and establishing new plantations on a limited\n            scale to meet projected industrial wood shortages; and (d)\n            strengthening research and trial programs to improve sector\n            productivity. The project would include the following major\n            components: (a) a forestry master plan, including a\n            five-year investment program; (b) forestry training; (c)\n            industrial wood plantations; and (d) technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1982-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
