CYCLONE REHABILITATION (ROADS) PROJECT
(IOAN 2490-SW})
pEUFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Cyclone Rehabilitation (Roads) Project in
Swaziland, for which Loan 2490-SW in the amount of US$8.60 million was approved on Febrary 5,
1985. The Loan was closed on December 31, 1990, two years behind schedule. It was fully disbursed
and the last disbursement was made on March 7, 1991.
The PCR was prepared by the Infasuture Operations Division, Southern Africa Department,
Africa Region (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and o) and the Borrower (Part II).
Preparadon of the PCR was stated during the Bank's finad supevision mission of the project in
March/April 1990, and is based, intmeraH  on the Report and Recommendation of the President of IBRD
to the Executive Directors; the Loan Agreement; supervision reporm; correspondence between the Bank
and the Borrower; and intenal Bank memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REpogT
SWAZILAND
CYCLONE REHABILITATION (ROADS) PROJECT
(LOAN 2490-SWI
Ob3ectives
On January 29, 1984, Cyclone Domoina struck Swaziland and the rainfall floods accompanying
the cyclone caused extensive damage to the road network. The pxoiect Oblectivwere: (1) to prevent
further deterioration of the road network; and (i1) to restore the cyclonedamaged roads to the pre-cyclone
service level. In the coatext of the extensive damage caused, these objectives were timely and appropriate
to avoid a breakdown in the economy. Ibe project was successful In meetng the main objective of
restoring the cyclone-damaged roads and bridges to their pre-cyclone condition.
Im            d       =m_. The planned targets of the prject were completed on schedule.
However, the Loan Closing Date was extended twice for a total of two years mainly to complete: (i) the
increased scope of district roads rehabilitation by 155 km (30% increase); and (il) rehabilitation of seven
minor bridges wbich were added as a separate componen in June 1987 and March 1989. The additional
works were financed from savings in cost per km under distict roads and funds reallocated from
techical assistance ad consultant services, becae these components were picked up by other donors.
The loan was closed on December 31, 1990. The Borrower was able to process proement of worms,
goods and services on schedule and complied with all covenan  including submission of audit reports.
The Bank's project supervision performance at both the field and headquarters level was good and has
contributed to the successful completion of the project. A good relationship was mainained throughout
the project implementation period (Sections 8 and 9).
Bulta. Achievements under civi works, which was the main component of the project, has
been higher than originally planned. Technical assistance and consultant services were put in place on
time and this contributed to the succesf completion of the project
Susminabilk. Ihe project could maintain th estimated benefit through its economic life
provided the roads are mainained to a acceptable level. However, road mantence has traditionally
not been given the deserved attention, and most of the wads exhibited maitene deficiencies a few
years after completion (pra 9.05).
I__ ga EdL. A force account can be used successfully to implement projects
if, as is the case under this project, it is pwperly designed to provide experienced project managers;
equipment avalability is maintainod to an acceptable level through the use of private garages and
workshops; and provision is made for spare parts (pata. 6.2). The continuous presence of highway
engineers for the supervision of the project which focussed on civil works contributed to the success of
the project. Road maitenance sffe from a shortage of experienced Swaziland highways engineers and
insufficient m=nagement systems. Thee issues were discussed with concerned Govenment officials, but
the problems remain unsolved.

Country:     Swaziland
Sector:      Ifrastrutr
Subsector:    Roads
2.    BMkggnn
2.01  Swaziand has a  aport iastuctu  consisting of about 2,800 km of roads, 289 km of
railways, and 20 km of cableways, one Inational airp.ot, and a number of airstrips. rhe road
network is he main traWort infrsructure awl carries most of import and farm-to-market taffic and
plays a vital role in the couty's economic deveopmeat, which is highly dependent on extetnal trade.
2.02  The economy is dualistic. Ihe modem sector consist of mining (coal and, until recendy,
asbestos), large scale plantatios, such as foresty, sugar cane, chrus and pineapple and the associated
industries, such as pulp, sawmilling, sugar and fruit processing. The traditional sector is largely catle
raisn and subsistence agriculure (maize, gondnt, sorghum). Both sectors of the economy are highly
depenient on a cost-effective transport iucure.
2.03  In view of the vit role of dte sport setor to e  eonomic and social deveopmet of the
country, the Goverment's trport sector policy is focued on improving transport services and
reducing transpt costs. Ihe road ubsector beig the main transport infatuctre, the Governmt's
princpal objectives are: upgra     existin road li1; expanding the road netork, especially distnct
roads, in arm  of high economic potent; and providi  an adequte levd of road manteace. The
Government's 1988/89 expenditu  for the tasport sector wu about seven pecen of the total budget
expenditure; of the tanport expenditures, about 80 percent wa for road improvement and maintance,
which is in line with the volume of services provided by thbe road infrastruture.
2.04  The Banks involvement in the road sbsecoMr srted in 1963 with a credit of US$2.8 million
(Credit 20-SW) to hep f.ance the construction of a 181 ki, two-lae, aU-weather highway. Including
the Cyclone Rehabilitation (Roads) Project, thie Bak has financed four road projects, and the main
objectives of the projects were focussed on impwoving the condition of the roads; providing technical
sane for instiutional support, training, procement of road      and workshop equipment;
and conultant services for eneering design and contrat suevison  Al four projects were
satisfactorily completed almost on schedule.
2.05  On January29, 1984 Swazilad   struckc by Cyclone Domoina, which caused extensive damage
throughout the country, mainly by severe floods from the intesv rainfall accompanying the cyclone.
The Bank, other fiancing agencies, donors, relief organiato  and Govemment from over fifteen



countries quickly responded to Swazuand's request 'r dsr assistance. The Cyclone Rehablitation
(Roads) Project, Loan 2490SW, was nitiated in response to tbe Government's request for aistance for
the restoration of the damaged roads and bridges.' 'ho proect was prepared and appraised on an
emergency basis and was approved on the basis of the Presidet's Report and Recommendation  the
Execudve Directors, dated January 10, 1985. No Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) was prepared for the
project.
3.    pSogg  Qtv          D s
3.01   .rqhc  bectves: Theprpject was initiated to restore the rods and bridges damaged by the
raifll floods accompanying the cyclone, and the objectives were to:
(I)    prevent further deterioration of the road network; and
(ii)   restore the road network to the pro-cyclone service level.
3.02   Pleit   D       : At appraisal the project comprised:
(i)   rehabilitation of about 700 km of main roads by contract, about 500 km of district roads
by force accoun, and recontruction of approaches to the Mhkoudvo, Lusutf, and
Mzimpofu River bridges by conrc;
(Ii)   provision of technical assistance to the Central Trnsport Administon (CrA)
consistng of three advisors; and 
OHii)  consultant services for (a) pavement testing, feasibility and detailod engeering studies
for rehabilitaion of the paven'nt strucure of Tshanani-Mlawula road, and (b)
construction supervision of the civil wors in (i) above to be constructed by contract.
4.    PigRDein   andOgiian
4.01          ao            The concual foundation for the project design was aimed at restoring
the road infrastructure to the pre.cyclone service level, and this was shared and understood by all relevant
paties.
4.02        Q. 7b scope and scalee of ho projec was dictated by the need to restore the
damaged roads and bridges to their pre-cyclone condition to avoid a breakdown in the economy. A
reduced scope and/or scale would have mea  ailowing some of the exstg roads to further deteriorate,
which rould have affectd the economy and required the recon on of defrd road linis at a much
higher cost at a later date.   
4.03   Preoaratlon and TEmin. In response to the Govenment's reques, a Bank mission visited
Swaziland in Februy 1984 Oess than one month after the disaster) to assess the damage to the wads and
bridges and to provide guiance in prepig a project for Bank fmcing. The Government, assisted
by consultnts and technical assistanco financed by bilateral aid agencies, notably the Overseas
Development Administion (ODA) of the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States Agency for
lIteratonal Development (USAID), in July 1984 complted a five-year roads and bridges rehabilitation
program for restoradon of the damaged roads and bridges. The Bank appraised the project in August
1984 immedy after the Goverment completed the prepartion of the five-year road rehabilitaton

program. Ibe program was well prepared nd timey and bad receved the endotsemeat of th lBank, the
African Devdopment Bank (AfDB), the ODA, USAID and other dowr agencies.
4.04  Roles an                                 A . Within six days of the occurrence of the
cyclone, the Glovenmen established a MinIstea Dsasm  Commlttee at the Mnistry of the Ilnteior and
Immigration to amems the damao and take immediate steps to avoid a breakdown in the economy. Four
other committes wero established to take required measures to rectif the damage caused in specific
sectors. The committee chaired by the Mistry of Worb and Commcatons (M9WC) was responsible
for coordinang the preparaton of a program for rehabilitation of the damaged roads and bridges. A
donors' committee was charged with the responsibility of collecti  and dbisemit   informadon on
affected areas and most urgent needs, and of coordnating the effort of providing food and shelter for
families rendered homeless by the disater. Tbrough such or onal arangements, the Govenmeot
managed to defn clearly the roles and responsibilities of instidons and agencies responsible for the
project and the damage cased by the cyclone as a whole.
5     aM-ea  em'entadon
- S.01     1. Although Loan 2490-SW was approved on Februtry 5, 198S, it became
offecive teo monts later on Dmber 10, 1985, principally due to delay on the part of the Govaement
in providing informaton on external public debt which was rquirted for the signing of the loan,
aravated by changes among Govement misries. The rebabiltation of district roads by force
accoum unis old have stat earolier, and vaiation i disbursements between planned and acta Crable
3 in Part IM) could have been reduced if such a dday had been avoided.
5.02   I_l_    nI SCs l. The Lo  Closing Date was extended twice and the project was
compled in December 1990, two years aftr the origial Closing Date. While the planned physical
targets at appraisal wero completed almost on schedule, the Project Completion Date was eended to
carry out the rehabilitation of an addItional 1SS km of disict roads and seven minor bridges which were
added as a separate component for financing under the project. Ihe additonal work was financed from
savigs under: (I) district roads rehabiliaton, US$0.26 million; (I) financing of three CrA advisors by
GIZ inte_A of the loan as originally planned, US$0.63 million; (ii) the uallocaed category of the loan,
USSI.86 million; (iv) main roads rehabilitation, US$0.08 million; and (v) consultant semvices for
pavement testing, feasibity and daed engiing sudia, USS0.IS millo which were fivanced by
other donors. Part of the svings was also used o  cover increased cost for consultas sorvices for the
supiion of contracts for the rehabilitatiodn of sevea minor bridges and for puhase of road
maenance equipm
5.03  Decisions and Actions Dug  Pmiect  lement.don- MThe major decisions made during project
Implemenation were Inc ing the scope of the distict roads to include a separate component for the
rehabilition of seven minor bridges, and obtbini  fnding from other donors for the finncing of the
tecical asstance to CTA and cosltat srvices for paveme  testg and enineering desigL These
decisions and acdons we  propriate, since they enable the Govement to restore more of the damaged
roads and brldes to their pre-cyclone condidon which was the main objective of the project.
5.04  Ds       _. The annual dIsbursements under Loan 2490-SW are given in Section 3 in Part
M. he variaons in             betweon apprais and actual were due to: (a) a ten-month lapse from
the loan approval date to  effcivenes; (b) lower cost per km for district roads rehabilitation while
accomplishment was on target; and (c) we of other donors' fiancing for part of the consultants and
tec;al assistac services originally planned to be financed by the LoanL
3



S.0S  EmmO  C&U. To etIMAd  ost of th pojct at appraisl was US$11.38. Tho fnl cost at
compledon was USS13.49 millon. 'he 18% cost incrae over the appraisal esimat was mainly due
to inuaes in the scope of civi works beyond targets agroed at appraisa. The addtiond cots were
finced by avins  in other categoris of the project and fwnlWg from other donors.
5.06 EnWJIRiab. Mhe risk mssoued at appraisal were: (a) implementation could be slower than
expected; (b) co  could be higher than forecast; and (c) there could be little or nor tsffic growth. None
of the three stipulated risk occurred; Instead, the cost for physical works was less than the forocast and
wors were complted almost on schedule, and as a result achievemes in meetin the project ok  ' lves
were higher than planned.
6.            Results
6.01    P    g    es. The project wa successfib in meetag the principal objecdve of restoring the
damaged roads and bridges and thereby avoiding a breakdown in the economy.
6.02     aId AImentnderIDistcRds. Tbe rehabilitadon or the district roads was carried
out by the four force account units of the Roads Branch of the Miistry of Works as planned at appraisal.
The four uni satd work on schedule and wore able to complete 1S5 km more than the planed 500
km at a cost per km of seven percent less than the appraisal esimate. The management of the unis was
supported by two highway engineers finnced by USAID. The USAID also financed the repair and
mainteance of the force account units equipment by local private garages and workshops and the
purch    of spare parts. These inputs enabled CTA to Inprovo the equipmet availability from 46
percet  at appras to 80 percent during project implemenion. Tbe good performance of the force
account units was due to the sound design and organization of the component.
6.03   lft&   Achievement under Main Road and B _dd. Tbe rehabilitation of the main roads,
seven minor bridges later added as a separate component, and reconstruction of approaches to three key
bridges were carried out by contract applying International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and Local
Competitive Bidding (LCB) procurement methods. A total of 14 conts wore awarded for the 700 km
main roads (300 km by ICB and 400 km by LCB); the worls were completed in June 1988 six months
a;e the esdmated completion date which is satisfactory achievement compared to many road projecu
in the region. The reconsuction of the threo bridges approach were started prior to loan effecdveness
and wa financed under USS0.43 mllion retoactve fincing provided in the Loau Agreement.
Rehabiliton of five minor bridges was included for fincing under the proje in June 1987 and
another two bridges in March 1989. Contracts for tb first five minor bridges were awarded in June
1988 and work was completed In twelve months. 7.',e ontracts for the two additional bridges were
awarded to the same conaor and work was completed at the end of 1990. Government's perfomance,
support by consltants, was good and significandy contributed to the successful and cost-effective
implemeaion of this component
6.04  Purcha  ouipminand j hicles. ITe prject provided US$0.18 million for purchase of
essential equipment for the force account units. A total of US$0.60 million was disurWsed under this
category; the Increased d ement was due to the purchas of five dump trucks and four graders for
road mainean  which were included for finncing under the project in 1989 at the Government's
request, and with Bank approval. AU of the equipment was purchsdtho ugh international shopping by
Iviting quottions from at least three supplieas.
6.05   mnaTechnicasisnce Wu. The Government was able to appoint the three
advisors to CTA In Septeer 1985 in compliance with the Octobr 1, 198S date specified in the Loan

AgreOment. The twO supeviing consultant ftm  wer engaged a planed, their perform     wa
satisfactory. The works wea completoe only si8 mont aer the planed peiod, except works on the
newly added seven minor bridges. Oveal, all consultant services and techi  assistance services
planed unde the project were ongagd on dme followiag the Bank's and other donors' procurement
guiddines. The pavement tesdng, fasibity studies, and detilod ngineeing for two paved roads were
complaetd on time..
6.06    Pm.  The project objectives were attained to a higher degree than what had been
originally planned under the project; rehabilitation of additional 1SS km of district roads and seven minor
bridges was included for financing under the project during project implemetation. This achievement
of higher physical targets has avoided further deterioration of the roads and bridges without which the
macro and sectoral growth would have been adversdy affected since the road network is the main
provider of transport in the country.
6.07   _imh          m      lQnaLRaiaDmU. The project was inidated in response to the
damage caused by Cydone Domoina, and it was focussed on civil works with litdo or no input in human
and insdtudonal development lastig beyond the project implementation period. Experienced Swazi
engineers are In short supply and Swaziland would have to contdnue using techical assistance and the
private sector to cope with its road works requiremen. The institudonal developmeat of the Roads
Branch, including the introduction of appropriate management system, is an area which deserves
immedite attention .
7.     Weo  Susainabilit
7.01   Economic Bendts. Since the project was an emergency project, there was no economic analysis
at appraisal. However, economic rates of retum on the regravelling of main roads were calculated for
the purpose of the Issues/Decision Meetng. Thoe conomic rate of return was calculated for a
representative sample of four main roads based on savings in the operating cost of vehicles. The
economic rate of retu  for the four roads are above 170%. The rat of returns are higher than estimated
at the Issues Pa  stage due to the fact that: (a) traffic volumes on these roads were considerably high
before the cyclone and grew rapidly from 1988 onwards (year of project compledon), and (b) actual
rehabilitation cost wero lower than estimated.
7.02   The project could maint  the ben     estimated at appraisal throughout its economic life
provided the roads are maiained to an acceptable level. However, road manintea  has not been given
the deserved attentdon and An  of the roads exhibit mce deficiencies. The inadequate level of
mdatance is attributable to the inabiliy of the Mistry of Works to udlize budgetary fAwds allocated
for _mannce.  'Me prmary source of ths deficiency in road mantenan    performance is the
organizational and stg inadequacies in the Roads Branch. he need for strengthening the isitutonal
apability of the agency responsible for roads is one criteal area which the Govment needs to address
as soon as practically posible. ITis problem was repeay discussed by the Bank supewrision mission
with the relev   GovMt officials.

8.01   pft mnce in the Ey  Stae. Tbe Bank made a positive contribution by quicldy responding
to the Goverment's request for assistance to resro the flood-damaged roads and bridges. Tbe project
was identified, prepared, apprised and approved in twelve months which, considering the emergency
nature of the project, was too long. However, immediately after the damage, the Goverament was able,
with the asitc  of USAID and ODA, to carry out emergency works to open the roads for dry season

traffic. The project was processe as a reconstcton after disaster (RAD) and the Bank's standard Staff
Appraisal Report (SAR) was not prepared, resulting In the reduction of the project preparation period.
Tho Banks agreement to provid retroactdve financing for the reconsucdon of approaches to three
bridges enabled the Govenment to open some of the roads to traffic within a short time thus reducing
the negadve effect on the country's economy.
8.02   UMisio. Eight supervision misions were made during the five years of project
implementation, averaging about 1.6 missions per year. The time spent in the field avraged seven days
per supervision mission, which is considered reasonable for the type and size of the project.
8.03   1        o. Most of the missions were made by highway engineers which was
appropriate since the main components of the project were civil works; this kind of activity required
engineering advice and decisions. Review and clearance of procurement documents for works, goods and
senricos were handled expeditiously. The continuous presence of highway enginees from appraisal
through project compledon contributed positively to the satisfactory prect implementation by providing
needed support in the roview of procurement documents, and in assesing and reviewing the
Government's reques fbr increasing the scope of rehabilitation of district roads and inclusion of a
separae component for the rehabilitation of seven minor bridges.
9.    Be== Perf a
9.01   Project repari  and Star-Un. The measures taken by the Government in establishing
committees of high-levd Government officials to address the cyclone damages contributed to the success
attained in both the emergency and longer term actions to rectify the damages. Ihe Goverment was able
to prepare a five-year roads and bridges rehabilitation program within five mondts of the cyclone disister.
The program was sound and completed on time and received the endorsement of the Bank, ODA, USAID
and other donors. The Governmet was able to appoint the three advisors to CTA in Seember 1985,
in compliance with the October 1, 1985 date specified In the Loan Agreement. Procurement documents
for works, goods and services were processed on schedule and thbis enable the start of civil works on
schedule.
9.02   ptaject Implemenion. 7The performance of the Road Branch's four force account unitS was
good. This was possible because of the sound design applied for the impltion of the component
which included provisions for OI technical assistance advisory services to CTA; (u) financing of
equipment repair by local private garaes and worshops; (iii) fiancig of spare parts; and (iv) technical
sistance of two civil engineers to manage the force account units. Througb the use of private garages
and workshops, CTA was able to increase its equipment availit   from 46% at appraisal to 80% at its
peak durig implemenaon.
9.03   De1ansQio ings p lamonentatn The Govrment's decision o increse the scope of district
roads rehabilitation and to add the sewen minor bidges rehabilitation as separate componens for financing
from the savings under the project were sound and by doing so almost all of the damaged roads and
bridges in the country were  stored to their pre-cydone conditions. The decision to finance consultant
services from other donors at favorable terms helped by releasing funds for civil works which were the
essntial main objective of the project.
9.04   Main LIO gf Exenc   The efficiency attained by having equipment maintenance and
repair caried out by private garages and workshops is a postive experience which should be possible
to sustain on a long-term basis. The effective pefomace of the force accoun units through appropriate
project management support is another important leson leared during the project implementation.

9.05  Ist       C.= The Roads Branch of MOW has a critical shortag, of qualified and
experienced Swazi engineas.  hbi und Is bound to condtue unless Goverment deveopments a policy
to train and be able to retain expedenced Swazi engineers through appropriate itives.
9.06  Road Min       . The level of road maieace was ased as being below the requirement,
mainly due to insufficient allocadons of resources (manpower and equipment) and inadequate planning
and mangement system. Ihe orgaizatonal set-up of the Roads Branch requires a carel review and
restructrng to provided needed autonomy in decision-making in both technical and administrive
operations of the agency.
10. 
Bank staff and officials of the Govmerment involved in the implementation of the projea enjoyed
an amiable and highly professional working relationship. There was good continuity in Bank staff
assignments throughout the Implemenaion period. The condnued prece of highway engineers in the
supervision of the project helpd in achieving the success of the project since its major component was
civil work. There was good coordinadon among the financial agencies involved.

CYCLONE REHABILITATION (ROADS) PROJECT
(LOAN 2490-SW)
PRT II:  PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER s    SPECTIVE
Gin
1.    Isi Paut U of the Projet Compledon Report (PCR) for the Cyclone Rehabilitaton (Roads)
Projec is prepared as requied in the Projec - Loan Agreemnt between the Governmnt of Swaziland
and the World Bank.
2.    The Governmt, in August 1991, recelved Parts I and m of the PCR prepared by the Bank.
The evaluation of project implementaton in Part I and the stadstical data in Part m cover the main
aspects of the project, and the Government finds the report accurate and comprehensive. We only wish
to add our own brief assessment and advise actions being taken to overcome the difficulties encountered
to improve performance in the futuro. The response of the Interational DonOr Agencies and World
community organizations was overwhelming and the Government and the people of Swaziland are gmeful
for the generous support without which the country's social and economic sectors would have been
sriously affected for an extended period.
3.    During the project implementation there were coLstraints and problems, in areas of Government
procurement procedures, availability of local funds and institutional capacity, but in spite of these the
project was successfully completed on schedule.
4.    The Bank's agrmen to Govenment's request to include the rehabilitation of the seven minor
bridges has paid significant dividends to support the economic development of the country.
S.    The Governmet is well aware of the need to overcome some of the constais which featured
during the project and has implemnt  measures to rectify the poor performance, particularly in
equipment, road mantenance and manpower development The rel need to keep the rehabilitated roads
well mnned is fully appreciated and the finding of a recent Mainteace Study ar to be implemented
with substni incres  in expnditare on contract works and traingt enges. CrA is beig
reorganized and equipped to opeate on a commercial basis. These deveopments are being funded by
ADD, ADF and GTZ.
6.    The sragy adopted in solving the road maitenance problem is to carry out a large portion of
road maitenance by contma Instead of by force account. The shortage of experienced Swazi Engineers
has been a concer for a long time and although effors have been made in the past to have Swazi
Engineers trained abroad, the turnover of ngiers leaving the public sector to join the private sector
both within and outside Swaziland has been high. Provision of Incenives over and above job security,
equal to or more than the private sector, since it affec  all public service staff of the t3overnment and
since such Incentives have to be related to productivity and accountability. The Government is makdng
eff   to miimiz the problem relatod tO budgetary constnts and inefficiency will reduce as the
strategy to cOntract Out most maintennce operations is put in place.



AsgMiUM of Mai Q       i39g
7.    The following is a brief assessment of tbe implementation of the main components of the project
and the performance of those involved in tho project implementation.
S.     Roa. As provided in Part I of the PCR, achievement in physical works has been more
than the apprabal targets. Even though the objective was to restore the roads to their pre-cyclone
condition, the rehabilitated roads are now of higher standards by including the following improvements:
(V)   upgrading of drainage stuctures to accommodate greater run-off water;
(ii)   check dams in erosion prone sections of side ditches and bridge embankments; thus reducing
environmental degradation;
(iii) raising the road grade in places to avoid flooding of the road surface; and
(v)   road signs and kilometre markers.
9.    performance of the Bank
Ihe Bank responded rapidly to Government's request for disaster assistance and this has been
fully appreciated by the Government. The damage done to roads and bridges by the rainfall flood
accompanying the cyclone Demoina consdtuted more than 70% of the overall damage cost. Without the
quick response from the Bank and timely implementation of the project, the country's economy could
have been negatively affected. The retroactive financing provision provided by the Bank allowed the
Government to open emergency access to disaster stricken areas even before the project was fully defined.
The Bank's agreement to Government's requests to include the rehabilitation of seven minor
bridges and to extend the loan dosing date contributed to a greater improvement in the condition of the
roads. Bank's response to procurement maters and disbursements has been timely and helpful. The
contribution of Bank's supevision missions has helped to solve engineerng and procurement matters and
Roads Branch Staff have benefited from the experience of the Bank staff.
10.   PSerQ_ac o               n echnical ss Anistan ice Sd.
10.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The two consultans engaged for the design of the rehabilitation work have completed work on
schedule and their services in the supervision of the contract works was of high quality. They were able
to improve on the design during the contract period capturing important aspects of work which needed
to be revised and updated. They have mantned good working relationships with the Roads Branch of
the Ministy of Works d Communications.
The technical assace to CrA financed by GIZ and two civil engineers financed by USAID
for the management of the force account units, performed exceptionally well. The CrA advisor's
equipment for the availability of about 80% compared with a previous figure of 40%. Ihe unit
supervised by USAID-finaced civil enginees managed to complete 130% of the target within the
planned period.

11.  _dmanegumm
Measures taken by the Government in establishing a disaster management committee significanty
helped in coping with the heavy emergency work involved. Extra effons were made by the Government
in mobilizing donor support and local funding needed for emerncy work. Even though, in general, the
public sector hu a shortfall of capacity to deal with emergencies, considerable offors were made to
ensure that the economy of the country was not severely affected by the cyclone damage.
As stated above, there are areas of constras and problems in policies and procedures in
processing procurement and for the release of budgetary funds. Special provisions to short-cut the normal
procedures should have been introduced to handle this emergency oporazion, but, was not possible
becase of the sudden nature of the disaster.
Governet is making a determined effort to improve policies and procedures to cope with the
road transport sector and in particular with he orgaization and isttutional capacity problems of the
Roads Branch of Ministry of Works and Construction. Account of measures taken to this effect is
highlighted in this assessment report

E_onomic Rate of Retur Aporaisal: Since the project was an emergency project, there was no
economic analysis at appraisal. However, conomic rates of return on the regravelling of main
roads were caklultd for the purpose of the Issues/Decision Meeting. The economic rate of
retun ranged between 18% and 146%.
Eeonomic Re evaluaiion: iEconomic rate of return was calculated for a representative sample of
four main roads based on savings in vehicle oporating costs. The economic rate of return for the
four roads are above 170%. The rate of returns are high than estimated at the Issues Paper
stage due to the fact that la) traffic volumes on these roads were considerably high before the
cyclone and grew rapidly from 1988 on (year of project completion) and Ib) actual rehabilitation
costs were lower than estimated.
