It\n            consists of a credit program designed to increase\n            agricultural productivity, exports and real farm income.\n            The project will directly benefit about 100,000 families\n            (550,000 beneficiaries) and will generate an additional\n            240,000 jobs.  It will assist the Government to improve\n            agricultural policies through the reduction of interest rate\n            subsidies.  Agricultural Trust Funds in the Bank of Mexico\n            (FIRA's) and the Trust Fund for Credit in Irrigated and\n            Rainfed Areas (FICART's) productive support programs to\n            farmers will be strengthened.
