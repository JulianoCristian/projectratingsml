MEXICO
NINTH AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
I. LOAN AND PROJECT SUHMAEY
Borrower:          Nacional Financiera, S.N.C. (NAFIN).
Guarantor:         United Mexican States.
Beneficiaries:    Agricultural Trust Funds in the Bank of Mexico (FIRA)
mainly for on-lending by commercial banks, and the Trust
Fund for Credit in Irrigated and Rainfed Areas (FICART),
for on-lending by BANRURAL, Mexico's largest agricultural
credit lender.
Aaount:            US$400 million equivalent.
Terms:             Fifteen years, including three years of grace, at the stan-
dard variable interest rate.
Relendinag Terms: THE BORROWER would transfer the proceeds of the loan to
FIRA and FICART under contractual arrangements satisfactory
to the Bank. Funds would be oa-lent by FIRA and FICART in
local currency to discount subloans on terms and conditions
specified in the Project Agreements and the General
Interest Rate Agreement (GIRA).
Project
Description:      The project supports the Government's medium-term
structural policy reform program and is linked to the
1986-87 external financing plan supported by the Bank and
other agencies. It consists of a credit program designed
to increase agricultural productivity, exports, and real
farm income. The project would directly benefit about
100,000 families (550,000 beneficiaries) and would generate
an additional 240,000 jobs. It would assist the Government
to improve agricultural policies through the reduction of
interest rate subsidies. FIRA and FICART's productive
support programs to farmers would be strengthened.
Finally, a rural financial subsector review would identify
problem areas and improve the agricultural credit system,
including further reductions in subsidies in credit and
crop insurance, improved efficiencies in the rural
financial system, and increased domeatic resource
mobilization.
Pro eat Risks:    The project presents no special risks in terms of the tech-
nical and financial soundness of the various investment
subprojects that would be financed. The risk of a reversal
of progress in reducing interest rate subsidies is small:
the Government is codmitted to the gradual elimination of
economic distortions and has a close dialogue with the Bank
on interest rates-including those charged to farmers-
within the context of the Government-Bank General Interest
Rate Agreement (GIRA). Govertment commitient to continue
rationalization of interest rates was demonstrated by its
upward adjustment in agricultural interest rates, relative
to the Average Cost of Funds (ACE), on May 1, 1987.

II.  THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
Agriculture in the Economy
2.01      Mexico's agricultural sector contributes about 92 to the gross domes-
tic product, employs about one-quarter of the country's active labor force, and
contributes about 6% to the country's exports. During the 1970s, the rate of
growth declined to average 3% per annum as terms of trade turned against agri-
culture. Also, agriculture's share of exports dropped dramatically and imports
sharply increased. Beginning in 1980, subsidies to agriculture were
substantially increased. As a result of increased resources for agriculture
and favorable weather, agricultural production increased in 1980 and 1981 at an
annual rate of about 6%. However, the policy of increasing subsidies on basic
products and inputs under the Government-sponsored Mexican Food Program (SAM)
proved to be too costly, and in 1982, when prices were allowed to lag behind
the high inflation rate of that ,ar, agricultural production fell by 1.0%.
Production increased by about 2.5% pea. primarily because of favorable weather
and a supportive exchange rate from 1983 to 1985. But in 1986 it declined by
4.2X due to a reduction in area planted, adverse weather and declining consumer
demand brought about by the general economic crisis.
Government Strategy
2,02      The evolution of agricultural policies can be separated into four
successive strategies over the past two decades: (a) 1965-1979, a period in
which agricultural growth slowed as output prices declined in real terus
because of an industrial-bias in policies including a strategy to subsidize
food for urban consumers; (b) a period, 1979-1982, in which support prices
were raised substantially in real terms and in some cases, to above equivalent
international prices and input subsidies were increased, especially on
fertilizer, credit and irrigation water, while the cheap food policy for urban
consumers was basically maintained through large food subsidies and price
controls; (c) 1982-1985, in which support prices were maintained at levels
close to world market prices, while some input subsidies were reduced in real
terms; and (d) the current phase initiated in early 1986, which began to put
in place more sustainable agricultural policies to respond to the severe
adjustment needs of the economy. Beginning in 1986, the Government reduced
input subsidies to agriculture, removed global consumer subsid;,s on food
products, reduced price controls on food and other products and started
targeting remaining food subsidies to vulnerable groups. In addition, it
prioritized its public investments for agriculture by eliminating uneconomic
and costly projects from its investment portfolio.
2.03      The current Government agricultural development strategy has been
formulated in a National Program for Integrated Rural Development (PRONADRI).
Through PRONADRI, the Government supports minimum farmgate prices in line with
production costs and world market prices. Also, it introduces a comprehensive
program to: (a) decentralize public agencies; (b) emphasize rainfed
agriculture; (c) increase water tariffs and quotas to permit more efficient
water use; (d) emphasize the training and organization of farmers; (e) improve
marketing through the reduction of excessive intermediaries; and (f) improve



- 4 -
coordination between production and agroindustries.
Bank Strategy
2.04      Since the early 1980s, the Bank has increased its involvement in and
dialogue on agriculture sector policy. A major pricing-subsidy policy review in
1981/82 led to an understanding between the Bank and the Government that
support prices would be kept in line with costs of production and world market
prices, and producer subsidies on purchased inputs would be reduced. For
fertilizers, direct producer subsidies have been reduced, and for irrigation
water, rates at which revenue from water charges cover expenditures on
operation and maintenance in irrigation districts have been increased from 26%
(1981/82) to 54% (1984/85). In addition, the Government and the Bank concluded
the General Interest Rate Agreement (GIRA) in August 1984, bringing
progressively interest rates, including those for agricultural credit, closer
to the cost of funds and providing for variable rates.
2 .05     In its continuing support to the Government's algricultural policy
reform, the Bank is carrying out an agricultural sector review in parallel with
the preparation of an agricultural sector loan. The review and loan are
focusing on the Government's agricultural policies and key sector iosues, such
as: (a) export promotion and trade reform; (b) subsidy control and targeting;
(c) pricing and marketing deregulation; (d) consumer subsidies and targeting;
and (e) public sector investment. An agricultural sector adjustment loan
proposed for FY88 would support, sustain and deepen on-going reforms through
further decreasing input subsidies, continuing the rationalization of pubUc
investment, reducing the role of parastatals (including in some cases their
sale or closure), and, in general, limiting the degree of Government
intervention in the sector.
Agricultural Credit
2.06      Total outstanding institutional credit to agriculture at end-1986 was
e timated at US$2.5 billion equivalent. Outstanding agricultural credit grew
consistently between 1977 to 1981 at an average annual rate of 10.5% in real
terms. This steady growth ended in 1981, reflecting Mexico's economic
difficulties, and institutional credit to agriculture fell b.y 14X in 1982.
While overall growth resumed in 1983 at about 23X p.a., it fall again in 1986
declining by 21% (Annex 2). Projections through 1991 however indicate a very
rapid increase in the demand for agricultural credit along with a general
recovery of the Mexican economy.
2.07      Because of the scope for improved cropping technologies and increased
irrigation, a large unsatisfied demand for credit remains. Production on only
56% of the area in the ten maitl crops were supported by credit in the
spring/summer 1986 season. Where the demand for credit is high, it is
estimated that less than 20% of all low-incoma producers receive inatitutional
credit in any one year.
2.08      Currently, agricultural producers are classified for credit purposes
in two groups: (a) low-income producers, earning net annual income from all
sources less than 1,000 times the relevant regional minimum daily wage; and



-5-
(b) other producers. Minimum daily wages are established for three economic
regions throughout the country and currently range between US$2.54 to US$3.05
equivalent. The definition of low-income producers embraces about 78X of all
farmers throughout the country, earning a maximum of about US$700 per
capita compared to the national per capita income of about US$2,200.
Agriculture credit is delivered through commercial banks, discounted thro'agh
FIRA (The Trust Fund for Agriculture in the Bank of Mexico) and BANRURAL, a
large public rural credit bank, which discounts in part through FICART (Trust
Fund for Credit in Irrigated and Rainfed areas).
2.09      FIRA.  The Bank of Mexico is the trustee for the three agricultural
trust funds, which are integrated for management and accounting purposes and
administered as FIRA: (a) the Trust Fund for Crop, L±vestock and Poultry Credit
(FONDO), which discounts participating commercial and public banks' short-term
subloans for crops, livestock and agroindustry; (b) the Special Agricultural
Trust Fund (FlFA), which discounts medium- and long-term subloans for crops,
livestock and agroindustry; and (c) the Technical Assistance and Loan Guarantee
Trust Fund (FEGA), which defrays to participating banks part of the cost of
subloan evaluation and technical assistance for low-income producers, and
guarantees part of the commercial banks' contribution to these subloans. FIlA
has ten regional offices, 38 state officea and 90 agency offices for providing
tee iical Assistance to the farmers, supervising sub-projects and assisting the
participating banks evaluate larger loans (Annex 3). FIRA and the Bank have
had a long and fruitful relationship, having satisfactorily completed eight
projects, with an ongoing Interim Project.
2.10      FIRA has consistently provided about 25X of all agricultural credit
in Mexico by wvy of discounts to the participating banks.  In 1986, FIRA
discounted about Mex$304.5 billion equivalent, 71% for short-term credit and
29% for medium- and long-term credit. Low-income producers received 46% of the
total. Bank funds utilized in 1983 and 1986 represented about 16% and 111,
respectively, of FIRA's total funding, compared to 151 in 1983 and less than
10% in earlier years.
2.11      ElRA's estimates show its lending prospects from mid-1987 to end-1991
at US$2.0 bill.ton equivalent. Of the proposed lending, about 301 would be for
mediumr and long-term credit, and about 701 for short-term credit.  In addition
to providing financial resources to the Mexican agricultural sector, FIRA
continues to provide technical assistance to producers through its training
programs, demonstration centers, and production technicians.
2.12      FIUA is an efficient financial institution with assets at
end-December 1986 amounting to about Mex$706 billion.  Throughout the years,
FIRA has earned a good reputation, and its management is experienced and of
high quality. Their technical assistance, supervision and loan evaluation
through their branch offices are effective and efficient. Its net operating
cost after recovery from demonstration centers and for productive support
through their branch offices has averaged about 21 of its average loan
portfolio with administrative costs averaging about 0.51 of its loan
portfolio. The banks through which FIRA's funds have been on-lent to
agriculture, have also developed a good capacity to appraise subprojects and to
recover cubloans.



- 6 -
2.13      Until 1981, FIRA consistently earned annual profits soafficient to
maintain its equity in real terms, However, in 1982 and 1983, when inflation
reached 99% and 80%, respectively, it was decapitalized at an average of about
30% per year because existing subloans were at fixed interest rates and lending
rates were below the levels of inflation.  As a result of increased profits
earned from higher and variable interest rates introduced under GIRA combined
with increased Government contributions, the position reversed in 1984 through
1986 when FIRA's equity Increased by an annual average of about 42%.
2.14      Commercial Banks prcvide the main channel for FIlRA's cn-lending to
agriculture.  Nationalized in 1982, the commercial banks continue to operate in
a manner similar to their previous role as private banks. As a result of the
extensive financial and technical support extended by FIRA, many commercial
banks have established agricultural credit departments with agricultural
technicians, who are graded and authorized to evaluate and approve subloaris at
varying levels. Officially commercial bank arrears, as a proportion of their
loan portfolio, have been oscillating around 4% since 1984; in June 1986, this
proportion was about 5%. Commercial banks' funds account for about 28% of
total agricultural credit; and about 92% of FIRA's total discounts in 1986
represented subloans made by commercial banks. About 34% of the amounts
discounted were to low-income producers.
2.15      FICART.  The other major source of discounting of agriculture credit
is FICART, a Government-owned fund which discounts mainly medium-and long-term
subloans to largely low-income producers exclusively through the National Rural
Credit Bank (BANRURAL) (Annex 4). In 1986, it discounted almost 65% of all
BANRURAL's medium- and long-term lending. Although FICART has not previously
been a direct and main beneficiary of a Bapk-financed project, it has
participated satisfactorily in executing credit components of four
Bank-financed projects. It has also executed five IDB-financed projects,
totalling US$484 million.
2.16      FICART has a strcng financial statement, with equity at end-1986
amounting to Mex$142 billion and no significant liabilities.  However, because
of subloans at negative interest rates, FICART owes its financial strength
largely to the continuous injection of Government contributions, including the
transfers of the proceeds of IDB and Bank loans as equity. FICA2T has
consistently earned gradually increasing net annual profits, and in 1986 earned
a net profit of about 20% of its average loan portfolio. In 1986 FICART
discounted in real terms Mex$55.0 billion about equal to its peak discounts in
1982. Between mid-1987 and end-1991, FICART is projected to lend US$900
million equivalent of which 66%would be for medium- and long-term credit.
2.17      FICART has shown a record of continuous improvement in its
efficiency. It ha& progressively reduced its net operating cost from 4.8% in
1981 to 2.3% ia 1986 of its average lar portfolio.  Furthermore, it has re-
duced its cost of administration from 3.8% to 1.9% over the same period. It
has no arrears, as its subloans are recuperated on due dates from BANRURAL.
The principal areas of institutional development that require further improve-
ment in FICART/BANRURAL operations are: (a) sub-loan evaluation procedures;
(b) further development of its information system including the arrears posi-



- 7 -
tion of subloans discounted; (c) evaluation procedures for measuring project
impact; and (d) delivery of technical assistanice. Procedures and systems
similar to those currently used by FIRA in its Operating Manual embodying
improvements in these areas were agreed to be adopted by FICART during
negotiations.
2.18      BANRURAL.  The largest agricultural development bank in Mexico is the
state-owned BANRURAL. It lends directly to producers, malnly low-income
producers, and has the most extentive network of bank offices in Mexico. At
end-1986, its lending stood at about US$1.0 billion equivalent, with medium-
and long-term lending accounting for about 22%, of which 48% is discounted by
FICART.
2.19      Although in the past there have been questions about BANRURAL's
efficiency, it has shown improvement.  Its overall arrears position of 9.5% in
1980 has been progressively reduced to 3.0% in 1986. The Government through
the Ministry of Finance, recently carried out an internal review of BANRURAL's
operations. As a result, better controls and procedures were introduced to
improve BANRURAL's operational efficiency. Additional studies, concentrating
on further improvement of its operations and finances, are to be carried out in
accordance with terms of reference and a schedule agreed with the Bank during
negotiations (para. 3.13).
Past Experience with Bank Lending
2.20      In the period 1976-1987, Bank involvement in the agriculture sector
of Mexico consisted of loans totalling US$2,841 million in 24 projects. Six
projects were concerned with agricultural credit (FIRA V to FIRA VIII and the
Interim ProJect) with Bank financing of US$1,130 million. In January 1986, a
completion report of FIRA VII was prepared that concluded that project
objectives were generally met, including increased credit to low- and
medium-income farmers and satisfactory returns to subprojects that generally
achieved the appraisal's financial and economic rates of return. Also, PIRA
strengthened its institutional development, decentralized operations, improved
subloan evaluation procedures, introduced an organization and procedures manual
to guide its own staff and that of the participating banks, expanded its
technical assistance program through demonstration centers, and intensified and
increased its training programs. The main drawbacks were: (a) the failure to
introduce an interest rate structure reflecting changing levels of inflation;
and (b) the failure to expand and improve its procedures for measuring the
impact of its lending so as to keep abreast of its expanded credit operations.
As a result of the experience of FIRA VII, the next agricultural credit
operation, FIRA VIII, was financed by the Bank only after a complete overhaul
of the Mexican interest rate policy, which resulted in GIRA. Also since
January 1986, FIRA has improved its sample and revised its methodology to
improve the monitoring and evaluation of its lending.
2.21      In general, implementation of current Bank-financed projects has been
slow, mainly because of the lack of counterpart funds and cumbersome financial
procedures. Because of the limited investment budget, the Government, in
consultation with the Bank, has closed down two Bank-financed projects, and
reduced the scope of other projects in order to increase the pace of



- 8 -
implementation of remaining projects. Some US$330 million in loan funds for
agriculture hes besn cancelled. In addition, financial control and
reimbursement procedures used by the Government have been unwieldly, causing
disbursesents to lag. Eowever, reforms in these procedures are being
implemented in 1987.
III. THE PROJECT 2/
Background and Rationale for Bank Involvement
3.01      The provision of credit is a key element of the Government's strategy
to increase agricultural output ana to raise living conditions in the
countryside, where most of Mexico's poor live. In recognition of this, support
to private farmers, ranchers and agroindustries has accounted for a major share
of Bank lending to Mexico. Past Bank-financed rural credit operations to FIRA
show that funds are utilized appropriately with significant production,
institutional, social and economic grains. The proposed project--the first in
which FICART/BANRURAL (Mexico's largest source of term lending for agriculture)
would participate directly-would extend the Bank's institutional development
assistance to FICART/BANRURAL. Without the proposed loan, FIRA and FICART
would have to curtail their lending programs. The proposed project, as
provlded in GIRA, would also lead to further reductions of interest rate
subsidies thus contributing vo the important policy objectives of phasing out
subsidies sad allocating financial resources more efficiently.
Project Objectives and Description
3.02      The proposed project supports the Government's medium-term structural
policy reforms program and is linked to the 1986-87 external financing plan
which are supported by the Bank ard other agencies. Release of
the third tranche of the commercial bank package to Mexico is linked to
effectiveness of the proposed loan. In accordance with this program and the
Government's objective of achieving agricultural growth while reducing the
fiscal deficit, the objectives of the proposed project would be to:
(a) increase agricultural productivity and thus agricultural
exports, real farm income, and rural employment;
(b)  assist the Government to improve agricultural sector policies
through a further reduction of the interest rate subsidy; and
(c)  assist the participating financial intermediaries to maintain
their financial integrity through: provisions for direct and
transparent transfers from the Government to cover remaining
interest rate subsidies; improved financial management; and
institutional development.
3.03      In order to achieve these objectives, the proposed project would:
(a) finance investment and incremental short-term credit to farmers
for crops, livestock, agroindustries and other activities
(e.g., aquaculture and horticulture);
2/ The proposed project was prepared by FIRA and FICART with assistance from Bank
misslons. Negotiations of the proposed loan were concluded in Washington D.C.,
in May 12, 1987. The Mexican team was headed by Mr. Arturo Galan de la Barreda
of NAFIN, and included representatives from the Secretariat of Finance, FIRA and
FICART.



- 9 -
(b) provide training, technical assistance and consultants'
services, as well an civil works for the construction of
demonstration centers, to support FIRA and FICART's productive
support programs;
(c) support a financial sub-sector review to identify further areas
to improve the rural financial system and increase resource
mobilization; and
(a) ensure that budgeting provisions are adequate to materially
maintain the capital structure of FIMA and FICART.
3.04      The proposed project would be impleme-ted in four years.  FIRA and
FICART would execute the project, which would cumprise: (a) about 27% of FIRA
and FICART's medium- and long-term loan portfolios; (b) 5% of their short-term
loan portfolios; and (c) support for FIRA and FICART's training and technical
assistance programs. Short-term subloans discounted to commercial banks would
be provided for the entire range of crop, livestock, and agroindustrial
activities. Agreed lending procedures --including interest rates, subproject
appraisal, supervision and preparation of investment programs, and monitoring
and evaluation-- would apply to FIRA and FICART's total lending programs.
Investment subloans to beneficiaries would be based on technically and
economically sound development plans. Both short-term and investment lending
woulA be for annual and perennial crops, livestock, agroindustries and other
agricultural activities. About 50% of the proposed loan proceeds would be
directed to low-income producers. The eetailed project description is in Annex
5 and illustrative investment plans in Annex 6.
3.05      Support to FIRA and FICART's training and technical assistance
activities would include:
(a) reinforcing the ongoing training activities including those
relating to monitoring and evaluation. Funds would be provided
for local and overseas graduate studies and state study tours by
FIRA's and FICART's staff;
(b) increasing the special technical assistance programs to low-
income producers which have proven to be the most effective
method for providing technical and managerial support to that
group. Under the project, funds would be provided So enable
FIRA and FICART to recruit and train additional technical advi-
sors. Consultancies would be engaged for about 70 staff-months,
of which expatriates would represent about 30 staff-months, for
technical assistance and training to new recruits under lhe
above programs, anl for the improvement of the monitoring and
evaluation system. Funds would be provided to finance motor
vehicles, equipment and study visits to established pilot
programs aimed at adopting new idesa and technologies; and
(c) supporting the e2tpansion of and promoting the demonstration
centers.

Project Costs and Financing
3.06      The proposed project is estimated to cost US$1,000 million, which
represents about 15% of FIRA and FICART's overall investment program through
1991. The foreign exchange cost, estimated to be 40% of project costs (Annex
1, Table 1) would be financ-A by the proposed Bank loan of US$400 million, of
which US$300 million would be allocated to FIRA and US$100 million to FICART.
Cf the remaining US$600 million, the beneficiaries would finance 24%, the
participating banks 24%, and FIRA and FICART 52%. The proposed loan would be
made at standard terms for Mexico to Nacional Financiera S.N.C. (NAFIN), and
guaranteed by the United Mexican States.
Procurement
3.07      FIRA and FICART would require subborrowers to obtain quotations from
several sources of supply, whenever practicable, for goods, civil works, and
imports of breeding livestock to be financed under subloans. Machinery and
equipment for agroindustries would be purchased by private producers or groups
of producers through commercial channels. Bulk purchasing under International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) would not be feasible, since the average agricultural
subloan would be small, about US$12,000, lending activities would be widely
distributed geographically, cover a variety of farm and ranch investment acti-
vities, and involve a large number of subborrowers. Approximately 50% of the
total value of subloans is expected to go to low-income producers and based on
past experience, the average size of low-income producers subloans would be
about US$11,000. A satisfactory selection of machinery, tractors and other
agricultural equipment and inputs is available to subborrowers through local
and international suppliers. Civil works and equipment for the productive
support component would be procured under local competitive bidding procedures,
acceptable to the Bank. Consultants for training and institution building,
estimated at 70 man-months, would be selected in accordance with Bank guide-
lines. During negotiations, the Government provided assurances that it would
cause FIRA and FICART to follow the procurement procedures described above
(para. 4.01 (a)).
Disbursements
3.08      The proposed loan is expected to be committed over three and one-half
years and disbursed over four years. The four-year disbursement period is based
on: (a) the Bank's experience under previous FIRA projects, which have consis-
tently disbursed more quickly than Bank averages for credit projects; and (b)
FICART's experience with IDB projects and the credit components of
Bank-financed projects, which have consistently been disbursed within the
estimated periods. However, ultimately the rate of disbursements will be
determined by the demand for agricultural credit. With the progress of
structural reform both in agriculture and in the economy, disbursements could
be even more rapid than anticipated. The Bank would reimburse FIRA and FICART
for 60% of the amount discounted by them to the participating banks and
BANRURAL (Annex 1, Table 1). Under the productive support component, the Bank
would disburse against: 100% of expenditures for consulting services and
foreign costs for training; 802 of local costs for training; and 100% of
foreign and 50X of local costs for civil works and equipment. A Special



- 11 -
Account of US$40 million would be established in NAFIN to facilitate Bank
disbursements. As in the case of earlier loans, disbursements would be against
statements of expenditures (SOEs) submitted by FIRA and FICART.
Project Execution
3.09      FIRA and FICART would be responsible for project execution.  Funds
would be channelled through participating banks, including BANRURAL.
Formulation, evaluation, approval, and supervision of investment development
plans would be carried out primarily by participating bank technicians approved
and supported by staff of FIRA and FICART. FIRA and FICART staff would review
a sufficient sample of appraisals on investment plans to ensure that the
appraisals are in compliance with their policies and operating manuals.
On-Lending Procedures and Interest Rates
3.10      The credit component would be on-lent to FIRA/FICART by the borrower,
NAFIN, over a period similar to that of the Bank's loan, in local currency at
interest rates that would vary with the ACF (an index of average cost of funds
to multipurpose banks). FIRA and FICART would finance up to 902 of the subloan
amount while the participating commercial banks and bANRURAL would provide the
remaining amount from their own resources. Low-income producers subloan
beLeficiaries would be required to finance a minimum of 10 and other producers
202 of the subproject costs. During negotiations, the Government provided
assurances that it would: (a) require participating banks to finance from their
own funds the agreed percentages of subloans; and (b) cause participating banks
and BANRURAL to lose eligibility for project participation if arrears of
subloans discounted by FIRA and FICART were in excess of 152 (para. 4.01 (b)).
A condition of effectiveness is that the Borrower would have entered into
contractual arrangements, satisfactory to the Bank, for transfer of the
proceeds of the loan to FIRA and FICART.
3.11      Interest rates to the ultimate beneficiary under this project would
be governed by GIRA. GIRA provides for the linking of interest rates to ACF, a
systematic accouating of subsidies, a gradual phasing-out of remaining
subsidies for most beneficiary categories, periodic adjustment of rates and a
reduction in the dispersion of interest rates. It also provides a framework
for financial sector work, and an agenda for a structured policy dialogue and
periodic consultations. The proposed project would support the continued
implementation of GIRA.  Interest rates for short-term and investment credit
are subject to periodic adjustments under GIRA and have reached ACF for
agricultural lending, except for those to low-income producers (Annex 7).
Also, the interest rates for all current lending are variable as agreed under
GIRA.
3.12      Both the nationalized and public banks adhere to the same on-lending
rate structure. The most recent interest rates (effective May 1, 1987) agreed
under GIRA for medium-and long-term lending are: (a) low-income producers: 752
of ACF (71.8X);3/ and (b) other producers; 101 of ACF (96.8%) 3/. Sbort-term
rates are two percentage points higher than medium and long-term loans. The
Government has confirmed that it would further reduce the subsidy currently
embodied in GIRA through a gradual adjuitment of interest rates to 901 of ACF
for low-income producers (an increase to 85% of ACF by January 1, 1988 and 902
of ACF by July 1, 1988).
3/ Based on April 1987 ACF - 95.8%.



- 12 -
3.13      Furthermore, in order to identify means of improving the efficiency
in agricultural financial systems, and increasing domestic resource
mobilization in Mexico, the Government would reviev the agricultural financial
sub-sector, including BANRURAL and the crop insurance schemes. This review
would include a study of the arrearages situation of commercial and public
development banks and ways of improving their portfolios' quality. It would
also examine alternatives for reducing or terminating subsidization of
agricultural financing, including better methods of targetting any such
remaining subsidies. During negotiations, the Government provided assurances
that: (a) the interest rates and conditions stipulated under GIRA would apply
to agricultural credit, (b) the Agricultural Financial Subsector Study would be
completed by January 31, 1988 and its recommendations, as discussed with the
Bank regarding, inter alia, improvements to the rural financial system and
resource mobilization, would begin to be Implemented by March 31, 1988 in a
time-frame acceptable to the Bank and; (c) it would ensure that adequate funds
would be budgeted annually to FIRA and FICART to prevent any material capital
erosion, in real terms, which they may have incurred on account of their
lending operations after January 1, 1986 (para. 4.01(c)).
3.14      Participating banks are allowed a discount margin between the
on-lending rate to the subborrower and that paid to FIRA and FICART of up to
10% of ACF or up to 9.6 percentage points. These margins were reviewed and
agreed during negotiations. The Government provided assurances that changes in
the margins allowed to participating banks would be agreed with the Bank.
(para. 4.01 (d)).
Subloan Appraisal and Supervision
3.15      Over the years, FIRA has develcped sound subloan appraisal and
supervision procedures while FICART is improving but needs additional
assistance, which would be provided under the project. Subloans would be
evaluated and approved by designated technicians from participating bank
subject to FIRA's/FICART's approval for subloans above prescribed limits.
Under the proposed project, FIRA and FICART would be required to obtain prior
approval from the Bank for project subloans in excess of US$800,000 equivalent
which also applies to individual subloans resulting from group activity. No
subloan would be made for on-farm investment if the amount of the proposed
subloan, together with the aggregate amount outstanding under previous
FIRA/FICART financed subloans to such a borrower, were to exceed the equivalent
of US$260,000 for each subloan beneficiary. FIRA's Operatiag Regulations and
Procedures Manual and FICART's Credit Operations Manual include the guidelines
for subloan evaluations, the determination of producer categories, the level of
authority for subloan approval, and the proper utilization of subloan
proceeds. During negotiations, the Government provided assurances that
FIRA/FICART would adhere to the above subloan appraisal and supervision
procedures (para. 4.01 (e)).



- 13 -
r-eirements
3.16      FIRA and FICART have both developed efficient systems of timely
reporting to the Bank.  Biannual progress reports summarizing project perfor-
mance, subloan disbursements by categories and FIRA and FICART discounts would
be submitted to the Bank no later than 90 days after the end of each semester.
During negotiations, the Government provided assurances that FIRA and FICART
would adhere to Bank reporting requirements and would submit a Project
Completion Report within six months of the Closing Date of the loan (para. 4.01
(e)).
Accounting and Auditing
3.17      The accounting systemiD of both FIRA and FICART are satisfactory; Flu
and FICART have consistently prepared timely audited annual financial
statements. Both FIRA's and FICART's accounts have been audited during recent
years by independent external auditors, and all audit reports on the financial
statements have been unqualified. FIRA and FICART would both maintain separate
project records satisfactory to the Bank.   An audit, satisfactory to the Bank,
would be made of the accounts, SOEs submitted to the Bank, and of the financial
statements of FIRA and FICART for each fiscal year. The audits would be
carried out in accordance with sound auditing principles consistently applied
by independent and qualified auditors. Certified copies of the annual
financial statements', together with the reports of the auditors, who would
also comment separately on the SOEs, would be submitted to the Bank no later
than six months after the close of each fiscal year. Adequate records would
also be maintained by the participating banks to identify all transactions
pertaining to FIRA's and FICART's discounted subloans. The Special Account in
NAFIN would be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank
and the auditors' report would be forwarded to the Bank no later than six
months after the end of each fiscal year. During negotiations, the Government
provided assurances that FIRA and FICART would adhere to the above accounting
and auditing arrangements (para. 4.01 (e)).
Project Benefits
3.18      It is estimated that the project would benefit about 100,000 fami-
lies, a total of about 550,000 beneficiaries, and would generate about 240,000
additional jobs. Secondary benefits would also accrue from processing and
agricultural service activities. According to model investment plans,
subprojects are expected to have financial and economic rates of return in the
range of 22% to over 50% (Annex 6, Table 1). The project would assist FIRA to
maintain itself as an efficient institution, strengthening those areas that
show weakness, such as monitoring and evaluation procedures. Moreoever, it
would be the first of a proposed string of Bank-financed projects involving, as
a direct participant, FICART/BANRURAL-Mexico's largest agricultural credit
lender. In this connection, it would assist FICART to become financially and
operationally more efficient and to positively influence BANRURAL.
Furthermore, the project through the financial subsector review and the
implementation of its recommendations would assist in reducing credit and crop
insurance subsidies, in improving the efficiency of the rural financial
systems, and in increasing domestic resource mobilization.



- 14 -
Project Risks
3.19      FIRA, with a long and successful association with the Bank, and
FICART, although having less experience and maturity, are efficient
institutions. Investment subprojects would be appraised and reviewed by these
institutions using procedures and methodology approved by the Bank so the
project presents no special risk in terms of technical and financiAl
soundness. Although the project supports continuing reductions in interest
rate subsidies, political pressures could reverse the progress achieved in
reducing the subsidies, especially with the present inflation rates. However,
the Government is committed to the removal or gradual elimination of
distortions and has a close dialogue with the Bank on interest rates
--including those charged to farmers--within the context of GIRA. Government's
commitment to reducing interest rate subsidies is underscored by its decision,
implemented on May 1, 1987, to increase the interest rate on-lending to small
farmers from 70 to 75 percent of the Average Cost of Funds (ACF).
IV* SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
4.01      During negotiations, the Government provided assurances that:
(a)   FIRA and FICART would follow procurement procedures as described in
para. 3.07;
(b) (i) participating banks/BANRURAL would finance from their own funds
the agreed percentage of subloans (para. 3.10); and (ii)
participation banks/BANRURAL would lose their eligibility for
project participation where arrears of subloans discounted by
FIRA/FICART were to be in excess of 15% (para. 3.10);
(c) interest rates and conditions stipulated under GDRA would apply to
agricultural credit; the completed agricultural financial subsector
review would be forwarded to the Bank by January 31, 1988, and its
recommendations as discussed with the Bank would begin to be
implemented by March 31, 1988 in a time-frame acceptable to the
Bank; and it would ensure that adequate funds would be budgeted
annually to FIRA and FICART to prevent any material capital erosion
in real terms, which they may have incurred on account of all their
lending operations after January 1, 1986 (para. 3.13);
(d)   changes in participating banks' margins would be agreed with the
Bank (para. 3.14); and
(e) FIRA/FICART would adhere to: (i) the subloan appraisal and
supervision procedures (para. 3.15); (ii) the Bank's reporting
requirements and would submit a Project Completion Report within six
months of the Closing Date of the loan (para. 3.16); and (iii) the
Bank's accounting and auditing requirements (para. 3.17).
4.02      A condition of effectiveness is that the Borrower would have entered
into contractual arrangements with the Government for on-lending to FIRA and
FICART (para. 3.10).



- 15 -
4.03      With the above assurances and conditions, the project would be
suitable for Bank loan of US$400 million.

MEXICO
NINTH AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
The Trust Funds for Agriculture in the Bank of Mexico (FIRA)
Bacground
1.        The Sank of Mexico is the trustee for the three agricultural trust
funds, which are integrated for management and accounting purposes and admi-
nistered as FIRA: (a) the Trust Fund for Crop, Livestock and Poultry Credit
(FONDO), which discounts participating comuercial and public banks short-term
subloans for crops, livestock and agroindustry; (b) the Special Agricultural
Trust Fund (FEFA), which discounts medium- and long-term subloans for crops,
livestock and agroindustry; and (c) the Technical Assistance and Loan Guaran-
tee Trust Fund (FEGA), which defrays to participating banks part of the cost
of subloan evaluation and technical assistance for low-income producers, and
guarantees part of the comercial banks' contribution to these subloans.
2.        FIRA and the Bank have enjoyed a long and good relationship, having
satisfactorily completed eight Agricultural Credit Projects on schedule, with
an ongoing Interim project (providing a total financing of US$1.4 billion).
With the FIRA VIII haviag disbursed over two years ahead of schedule, the
Interim Project was approved to provide the Government and the Bank suf-
ficient time to design a follow-up project. The interim loan is expected to
be fully disbursed by September 1987.
3.        In recent years, the Bank funds have played an increased role in
providing finance to FIRA; Bank funds utilize4 in 1986 and 1985 represented
about 11% and 162, respectively, compared to 15% in 1983 and less than 10% in
earlier years. The Bank's increasing role has been due mainly to: (a) as a
result of high inflation with fixed negative interest rates,. recuperation on
the existing loan portfolio was inadequate to maintain FIRA's level of
lending in real terms; and (b) while the Bank of Mexico provided the funds it
had committed at the beginning of each year for FIRA, it was unable to
contribute additional funds in line with FIRA's increased credit demands.
Financial Performance - Historical
4.        FIRA has continued to be a relatively sound financial institution.
Its consolidated financial statements at end-December 1986 showed assets
amounting to about Mex$ 706 billion (Annex 3, Table 2). FIRA's loan portfolio
at end 1986 amounted to Mex$ 597 billion representing about 832 of its total
*assets. During the five-year period 1977-1981, FIRA increased its lending to
agriculture at an annual average rate of over 202 in real terms. However,



- 21 -
ANNEX 3
Page 2 of 5
lending fell in 1982 and 1963. Lending In 1983 of about Mex$ 306 billion was
about 15% below the 1981 level in real terms. Due to fiscal constraints,
lending from 1985 to 1986 has declined again by about 24%, in real terms.
All subloan repayments are recuperated on due dates from participating banks
through the Bank of Mexico's current accounts; as a result, FIRA suffers no
arrears.  Arrears to participating comercial banks on a.bloans discounted by
FIRA are estimated to be about 4%. FIRA's 1986 lending comprised about 71%
for short-term credit and 29% for medium- and long-term credit. Low-income
producers received 46X and other producers 54X. Of the total lending, 46%
was for crop production, 29% for livestock, 12X for agroindustries and 12%
for other activities.
5.        FIRA has consistently earned annual profits in nominal terms.  In
1986, FIRA's average interest income on its average loan portfolio was 42%,
with a net financial income after interest paid of 23%. FIRA's operating
costs before recoveries, comprising technical assistance, demonstration cen-
ters and administration has consistently averaged less than 3% of average
loan portfolio with an increase to over 4% in 1986 due to an increased cost
of technical assistance and a reduction in the relative size of the loan
portfolio (Annex 3, Table 3).
6.        Until end-1981, FIRA's annual operating profits were sufficient to
avoid decapitalizatlon of its equity. However, the position changed In 1982
with the beginning of an era of high Inflation; Inflation was 98% in 1982,
progressively reducing to 60% in 1985 but increasing to 106% in 1986. This
occurred while existing subloans were at fixed interest rates and the
prevailing rates for current lending were not raised sufficiently to adjust
to the high inflation levels of the period. The decapitalization of the loan
portfolio was largely absorbed by the Government through: (a) Bank of Mexico
rediscounts of about 50% of FIRA's discounts at varying rates of interest,
allowing FIRA a fixed margin of three to three and one-half percentage
points; and (b) Government guarantees, which absorbed exchange losses on
almost all foreign indebtedness. However, even after deducting the Government
subsidy, FIRA still suffered decapitalization of its equity at an average of
about 30% per year during 1982 and 1983. Since 1984, because of the higher
interest rates required under GIRA (para. 2.04), the level of
decapitalization before Government contribution has begun to reduce. At the
same time, the Government has stepped up its contribution to equity by
assuming some of FIRA's external liabilities, converting them to equity
contributions. As a result, during 1985 and 1986, FIRA's equity increased by
64% and 39% in real terms, respectively.

Financial Performance - Projected
7.        FIRA has estimated its lending for the three and one-half years
(mid-1987 to 1991) at US$2.0 bill.ion, of which US$1 billion would be
short-term credit and US$1 billion medium- and long-term investment credit
(Annex 3, Table 4). Witlh this level of lending and to repay US$455 million
of external debt and interest falling due, FIRA would have a cash shortfall
of about US$1,138.5 million. The proposed Bank loan of US$300 million would
reduce this amount to US$838.5 million. It is expected that FIRA would
finance the balance of the shortfall by: (a) the Government rescheduling
some of the external debt falling due, obtaining a follow-up loan to the
existing IDB loan; and (b) obtaining increased Bank of Mexico and Government
rediscounting.
8.        While FIRA would continue to earn increased operating profits in
local currency, these profits would be insufficient to offset the
decapitalization of Its loan portfolio caused by those remaining subloans at
fixed and negative real interest rates. However, as those subloans are
repaid (within the next five to six years), FIRA would become self-
sustaining, earning sufficient profits to avoid decapitalization and further
Government support. In the meanwhile, Government contributions on a
progressively reduced basis would be needed.
Technical Support
9.        In addition to being one of the main providers of financial
resources to the Mexican agriculture, FIRA provides sig.tficant technical
assistance to commercial banks and to farmers, through its training programs
and demonstration centers. Throughout the years, FIRA has earned a good
reputation, and its management Is experienced and of high quality.
10.       FIRA operates a well-established system of 88 training and
demonstration farms, and 231 centers specializing in a wide range of
agricultural activities including: basic crops, milk, forage, fruits, beef,
small animals, irrigation and agroindustry. In 1986, a total of 1,247
courses and demonstrations were offered to about 27,811 participants, 11,451
of whom were reported to be low-income producers. Additionally, FIRA
complemepts the participating banks in providing direct technical assistance
to low-income producers. Its staff provides technical support to the
participating banks in preparing, evaluating and supervising the farm
development program of subloan beneficiaries.
11.       Recently, FIRA decentralized responsibility for the operation of
the demonstration centers to regional directors, and encouraged the greater
involvement of State Governments and SARK in the funding and program-planning



- 23 -
ANNEX 3
page 4 of 5
of these centers. For the future, FIRA would include successful experiences
gained from other programs such as the use of audiovisual aids and soil
conservation developed under other programs. More recently, FIRA has begun
to expand its "Asesores Tecnicos" program, which engages selected
technicians, including agronomists and bookkeepers on behalf of low-income
producers. The cost of this Drogram is shared with the producers, who assume
the full cost after four to five years. However, there is still a large
number of producers that requires and does not receive this type of support.
Organization and Management
12.       Two technical committees, one for FONDO and FEFA and the other for
FEGA, are the governing bodies of the funds. Each committee is composed of
ten members, and each is headed by a senior official of the Ministry of
Finance. FIRA is managed by a General Director who is also the Fiduciary
Delegate, two Sub-Director Generals, and assisted by six sub-directors who
are in charge of the following departments: programming; Organization of
Producers; Finance; Project Evaluations and Technical Assistance; Field
Office Systems; and Administration and Control. FIRA has, in addition to the
central office in Mexico City, ten regional offices, 38 state offices, and 90
agency offices; it also has a total staff of about 1,050, of whom 80% are
located in the field. On the recommendation of the Bank, FIRA decentralized
its decision-making--particularly with respect to budgeting, program planning
and execution--to regional and state levels. It also expanded the commercial
banks' facilities for providing technical assistance to their clients. Also,
the role of the FIRA regional technicians was changed, whereby there is:
(a) less emphasis on their direct involvement in providing technical
assistance to borrowers; and (b) more emphasis on their role of assisting
technicians from participating banks in identifying and organizing farmer
groups. Where necessary, FIRA's technicians provide training and technical
back-up to participating banks' technicians.
13.       To facilitate improved control and faster subloan processing
(subloans now processed within 15 days), FIRA introduced loan control centers
("Mesa de Apoyo"), located in each region for on-the-spot reviews of subloan
documentation submitted by participating banks for discount. Subloans
discounted, which are processed through the local Bank of Mexico branch, are
summarized and forwarded to its headquarters for overall review, processing
and control.
Planning and programming
14.       FIRA has made significant strides in streamlining, strengthening
and decentralizing its planning and programming efforts. The role of the
field offices has increased, giving the regional offices greater
responsibility in the formulation, implementation and control of its

investment program. FIRA has prepared a detailed framework, including
guidelines, for carrying out credit demand analysis by products and areas,
and for preparing lending programs by principal activities. Training has
been given to personnel at the field level, especially in the area of credit
analysis, using computer programs for analyzing and aggregating data for the
preparation of the annual investment program. Every July, FIRA prepares a
tentative investment program, based on previous experience, the Government's
policies and development targets, and availability of resources. In
September, this information is sent to the regional and state offices for
modification and adjustment an( -eturned to the central office for
finttization and approval by th- Technical Committee. Quarterly and annual
reports are prepared by the regional offices to evaluate the results on a
continuous basis, and the findings are reported to the central office and the
Technical Committee.
Monitoring and Evaluation
15.       The recent completion report of the FIRA VII showed FIRA's failure
to maintain a high level of efficiency in its monitoring and evaluation
procedures and to keep abreast of its expanded credit operations. However,
in January 1986, FIRA introduced a new and expanded sample for monitoring
subprojects, representative of its total lending program. While the basic
methodology would remain unchanged, the technique for gathering and computing
information would be simplified and the results would be more suitably
tailored to the users of the information.

NINTH AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
The Trust Fund for Credit in Irrigated and Rainfed Areas (FICART)
BacgMround
1.        The Trust Fund for Credit in Irrigated and Rainfed Areas (FICART)
is a Government-owned fund which discounts subloans exclusively through the
National Rural Credit Bank (BANRURAL) to the rural sector for farm
production, forestry and agroindustries. FICART was originally formed to
support irrigated farm production, mainly financed by the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB), and it was not until 1981 that it began to support
rainfed production. It was also in 1981 that it became involved in executing
the credit component of Bank-financed projects (PLANAT Loan 1945-ME, PIDER
Loans 1462-HE and 2043-HE, and FIDEC Loan 2262-HE). Both the IDB and the
Bank have found FICART's operations in project execution to be satisfactory.
2.        While FICART in a fiduciary of BANRUJRAL, it is responsible to a
Technical Committee,, comprising representatives from the Secretariats of
Finance, Agrarian Reform, Agriculture, Budgets, the Controller General, and
BANRURAL. This Committee dictates policies, credit programs, budgets,
personnel appointments, organization and management structure$, and
borrowings. To strengthen its independence from BANRURAL, the General Rural
Credit Law (Act 13) requires BANRURAL to conduct the operations between its
Finance Department and Trust Department only with the authority of the
Secretariat of Finance.
Lending
3.        FICART's lending program is strongly influenced by BANRURAL's needs
and the availability of resources. Its main role has always been the
provision of investment credit (medium- and long-term loans), with limited
provision of working capital introduced in 1982 to assist the increased
demand for short-term credit. FICART's lending declined from 1982 to 1983 by
16% in real terms. However, between 1982 and 1986 Its overall growth
remained static. FICART lends primarily to low-income producers, with 94%
f or investment credit in 1986. It primarily supports agriculture (56%) and
livestock (27%), and has more recently increased its support to other
activities such as agroindustries and fish farming. In 1986, its investment
lending supported about 1.7 million hectares of production, and its
short-term lending 770,000 hectares. During the next four years (mid-1987 to
mid-1991), FICART expects to lend US$900 million (Annex 4, Table 2), of which
US$600 million would be for investment credit. FICART suffers no arrears on
its outstanding loan portfolio as BANRURAL is required to automatically make
payments on subloans as they become due. However, .FICART has no information
on the outstanding balances of the subborrowers at the participating bank

Page 2 of 4
level, and as a result, is unable to exercise any control over their
repayments. FICART is planning to shortly introduce procedures to obtain
this information.
4.        While subloan evaluation procedures are of a reasonable level of
efficiency, they require strengthening, mainly in the area of agroindustries
and for larger operations. Subloan evaluations are carried out by about
1,000 specially approved BANRURAL technicians, who have the primary
responsibility for preparing the investment plans and their ultimate
implementation and supervision. FICART's technicians function as a quality
control with the right to refuse discount for those investments they consider
non-viable. Also, they have the right to cancel and recover the outstanding
balances of ongoing subloans where they observe, during their supervision
visits, that there is non-compliance with subloan conditions. In 1986, they
cancelled and recovered the outstanding balances of 483 subloans amounting to
Mex$1,152 million, for non-compliance.
Financial Performance - Historical
5.        On the surface, FICART appears to be a reasonably strong financial
institution, with an equity at end-1986 of Mex$ 142 billion, no indebtedness,
and an outstanding loan portfolio almost equal to its equity (Annex 4,
Table 3). Since its inception, FICART has consistently earned a net profit
in nominal terms, amounting to about 222 of its average loan portfolio in
1986. Its overhead expenses were reasonable, equal to less than 3% cf its
average loan portfolio in 1986 (Annex 4, Table 4). However, because of:
(a) the recent high inflation levels (98% in 1982 and going up to 105% in
1986); and (b) subloans at fixed negative interest rates, FICART's recent
profits were insufficient to avoid decapitalization. As a result, FICART
required strong injections of new equity contributions to maintain its loan
portfolio and equity in real terms.
6.        FICART has so far obtained all its financial resources through:
(a) external financing (31%), (IDB-27% and the credit component of Bank
loans-4%), for which the indebtedness was assumed by the Government;
tb) Government budgetary contributions (30%); and (c) profits earned (39%).
FICART's first important financing was received in 1976 through the IDB,
which has since financed five loans totalling US$484 million.
Financial Performance - Projected
7.        FICART's projected balance sheet indicates its projected financing
needs would be met from external financing through IBRD and IDB as well as
grants from the Government of Mexico. Shortfalls due to negative interest
rates on its portfolio after January 1986 would be met by the Government.

Paii 3 of 4
8.        Because of GIRA, which requires interest rates on now subloans to
be made variable and progressively adjusted with the majority to become
positive by beginning 1987, FICART's level of profits should increase.
Organization and Management
9.        FICART's internal organization and management is of * reasonable
standard, having improved significantly following Its reorganization begun in
1983. It is managed by a General Manager supported by departuent heads for
credit, finance and administration, external finance, and information. Also
it has an Internal Controller with a direct line of responsibility to the
Secretariat of Control. FICART's main management weakness relates to Its
lack of involvement In agricultural sector policy issues, including the
effect of fixed negative interest rates that causes the decapitalization of
the institution. FICART's total staff is about 550, of which about 552 are
field technicians.  Its head office is located in Mexico City, and it
operates 12 regional offices to coincide with BANRURAL's 12 reglonal banks,
plus 17 other sub-offices. About 60% of the staff are located in these
regional offices.
10.       FICART recently introduced (financed by the IDB loan) an integrated
data base system, which has already captured from manual records subloan
information from 1976 onwards. This information will form the basis for
improved planning and programming.  Also, personnel activities, skill
inventory, and accounting functions are being progressively added to the
system. Furthermore, PICART Is currently developing a system for measuring
the impact of Its lending. In the past, the evaluation of subloan impact was
limited to those subprojects utilizing special external technicians
(para. 12).
Training and Technical Assistance
11.       Although FICART's technical staff lack the experlence and budgetary
support of FIRA, its technical services are satisfactory and superior to
those available from other public services. It has a comprehensive staff
training program aimed at improving the efficiency of both FICART's services
and its technical staff. Most training courses are conducted at the regional
level and FICART draws freely upon specialists from SARH, FIRA and state
educational institutions to assist with instructions. Unfortunately, this
training is not as effective as It should be as, because of low salaries,
staff turnover is high.

12.       At the farm level, most of the technical assistance to FICART's
subborrowers is provided free by BANRURAL regional staff with support from
SARH. However, these staff are hard pressed to meet the demands of their
own, in addition to FICART's program. Also, there is now an awareness to
reduce these subsidized services, with the producers required to assume more
responsibility for financing their own technical services. As a result,
FICART is now promoting the use of external technicians contracted under a
special program, with the producers participating in both the hiring, cost,
and the monitoring of the quality of services provided. The full cost would
be assumed by the fifth year. Currently, because of limited resources, only
about 15% of FICART's lending is under this program. FICART plans to extend
this program under the proposed project.

NINTH AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Detailed Project Description
Crop Lending Program
1.        Investment lending for crops would cover the complete range of
production types from annual to perennial cropping under rainfed and
irrigated conditions. Crop investment subloans would include a diversity of
loan size, type of borrower and ecological condit.uns.  Investment items for
the crop leading program would include, inter alia, land improvement,
equipment and machinery purchases, civil works construction, including
supporting infrastructure for irrigation and storage, and establishment of
fruit orchards and industrial crop plantations.
Livestock Lending Program
2.        Investment lending for livestock would be for beef and dual-purpose
production, dairy production, and other livestock operations. As in the case
of crop investment subloans, there would be a diversity of loan size, type of
borrower and ecological conditions in livestock subloans. Investment items
would include purchase of breeding stock, renovation and/or establishment of
pastures, construction of buildings, fences and handling facilities and
provision of water supplies.
Other Agricultural Activities
3.        Investment lending for other agricultural activities would also
vary widely and would include the development of aquaculture, horticulture
and exotic crops destined for export.
Agroindustries Lending Program
4.        Investment lending to the agroinduotrial sector would go
particularly to small- and medium-scale producers. The portfolio of
agroindustrial investments--sawmills, fisheries, feedmills, grain elevators,
milk processing plants, and slaughterhouse facilities--would continue to vary
widely.
Short-term Lending Program
5.        Short-term subloans under the project would be provided for the
entire range of crop, livestock and agricultural activities.

Support Services
6.        Under the proposed project, support would be given to further
strengthen FIRA's and PICART's training and technical assistance activities.
This support would focus upon:
(a) reinforcing the ongoing training activities Including those
relating to monitoring and evaluation. Funds would be
provided for local and overseas graduate studies and state
study tours by FIRA's and FICART's staff;
(b) increasing the special technical assistance program to
low-income producers, programs which have already proven to be
the most effective method for providing technical and
managerial support to the low-income producers group. Under
the project, funds would be provided to enable FIRA and FICART
to recruit nd train additional technical advisors.
Consultancies would be engaged for about 70 man-onths, of
which expatriates would represent about 30 man-months, for
technical assistance and training to new recruits under the
above programs, and for the development of monitoring and
evaluation. Also, funds would be provided to finance motor
vehicles, equipment and study visits to established pilot
programs alsed at adopting new ideas and technologies used
elsewhere in Meoico; and
(c) providing resources to promote and adopt th3 experience of the
demonstration centers including the construction and equLpping
of new demonstration centers.

NINTH AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Illustrative Investment Plans
1.        The financial and economic results of the illustrative farm
investment plans, based on the FIRA/FICART current lending experience, are
shown at Table 1, with the detailed plans shown in Tables 2 to 6. Economic
values exclude taxes and reflect farm gate values of crops based on border
prices and shadow prices for labor (50%) and subsidized inputs.
Investment Plan No* 1: Rainfed Annual Crops Farm (160 ha)
2.        This model represents a typical farming system in the rainfed
areas of the temperate central states, with about 160 ha under cultivation
and about eight beneficiaries (mostly ejidatarios) per subloan. Existing
land use is based upon raiafed production of 120 ha of maize, 20 ha of
sorghum, 15 ha of beans and 5 ha of pasture. Under the project, the crop
mix would not change, but the 5 ha of pasture land would be cultivated and
Sown with beans. The productivity of all crops would be increased through
improved land preparation and cultivation practices, better control of
peat$ and diseases, the use of fertilizer, and some supplementary
irrigation from local streams and ponds. Yields are estimated to increase
from 1.9 to 2.5 t/ha for maize, 3.0 to 3.4 t/ha for sorghum and 0.9 to 1.1
t/ha for beans. Investment items include machinery and equipment (87%),
pumping equipment (6x), land improvement (41), structures and installations
(2x).  The net beiefits before development (including the value of labor)
estimated at US$10,000, are expected to increase to about US$20,000 at full
development, by year six (Table 2). The financial rate of return is
estimated at 291 and the economic rate of return at 23%.
Investment Plan No. 2: Irrigated Annual Crops (170 ha)
3.        This model represents a typical irrigation farm in the
arid/semi-arid north and northwestern states with 170 ha under cultivation
and about 17 beneficiaries per subloan. The existing land use, which is
based upon a cropping intensity of 1341 would remain unaltered with 26 ha
of cotton, 71 ha of wheat, 47 ha of sorghum, 36 ha of soybean, 24 ha of
safflower and 24 ha of beans. However, productivity would increase as a
result of improved land preparation and cultivation practices, better
control of pests and diseases and more effective use of fertilizer. Yields
for cotton would be increased from 2.4 to 2.9 t/ha, for wheat from 3.9 to
4.5 t/ha, for sorghum from 4.8 to 5.2 t/ha, for soybean from 2.0 to 2.3
tjha, for safflower from 1.4 to 1.9 t/ha and for beans from 1.5 to 1.7
t/ha. Incremental investment items include machinery and equipment (67%),
water pumping equipment (101) and land leveling (1%). The net benefits
before financing (including labor costs) of about US$29,600 would increase



- 43 -
ANNEX 6
Page 2 of 3
to about US$45,300 at full development at year seven (Table 3). The
financial rate of return is estimated at 47% and the economic rate of
return at 40x.
Investment Plan No. 3: Beef Cattle Ranching
4.        The beef cattle plan is based upon a typical 50 ha single owner
operation in the humid and semi-humid tropics of both the Gulf and Pacific
coastal states. A characteristic ranch is undercapitalized having beer
cleared and sown to African Star Grass or Guinea Grass for 10 years or
more, but with few other improvements. It has been grazed by local Criolla
or Criolla x Zebu cattle and used extensively with little inputs.
Production from such areas is low compared to that obtained in the same
environment under more intensive higher technology system. Under the
investment plan, 30 ha of run-down pastures would be rehabilitated; a
corral, 10 km fences and a shed constructed; and 10 breeding cows and one
bull purchased. The program would focus on improving herd quality through
a breeding plan; improving nutritional quality and pasture utilization
through better subdivision, use of fertilizer and control of grazing; and
improving health and sanitation practices. The total investment is
estimated at US$10,900 consisting of constructions and installations (56X),
breeding stock (401) and pasture renovation (4%).
5.        As a result of these investments, pasture quality is expected to
improve and the carrying capacity to increase from 1 AU/ha before
development up to 2 AU/ha at full herd development in year five. Mortality
would be decreased and fertility Increased while the live weight of mature
steers (3 years of age) would increase from 380 kg/head before development
to 430 kg/head after development. The before development net income of
US$1,350 would increase to US$3,500 at year five. The financial rate of
return including wages is 641 and the economic rate of return 109%.
Investment Plan No. 4: Dual Purpose Cattle Ranching (140 ha)
6.        This dual purpose plan is based upon a typical operation of 20
ejidatarios in the tropical and sub-tropical coastal states of Chiapas,
Tabasco, Veracruz, Campeche,  Yucatan, Quintana Roo, Jalisco, Colima and
Michoacan. The existing run-down pastures of Africa Star Grass or Guinea
Grass would be renovated or replanted, fertilizer would be used and more
intensive use of pastures made through better control of grazing. Also,
small amounts of locally available concentrates would be fed as supplements
during periods of reduced pasture production.   Under the plan, herd
management would be improved, stocking rate would be doubled and a cross
breeding program (Zebu x Brown Swiss) implemented to improve the milk
poduction potential of the herd.  In addition, health and sanitation



- 44 -                         ANNEX 6
Page 3 of 3
services would be intensified. The main investment items included are
breeding stock (67%), machinery and equipment (16%), pasture rehabilitation
(10%) and construction and installations (7%).
7.        As a result of these investments, carrying capacity would
increase from 1 AU to 2 AU/ha and the total number of cows in production
would increase from 40 to 89 head. Milk production would increase from 640
lt/lactation to 1,080 lt/lactation, the calving coefficient from 75% to
90%, and the weight gain of fattening steers from 0.347 kg/day to 0.365
kg/day. The before development net income (including the value of labor)
of US$3,500 would increase to US$21,500 at full development at about year
eight. The financial rate of return is 48% and the economic rate of return
54%.
Investment Plan No. 5: Irrigated Mango Plantation (50 ha)
8.        This model typifies many of the perennial fruit crop investments
which are being developed with credit from FIRA and FICART, mostly in the
semi-arid/arid irrigated areas of the northwest and rainfed areas on both
the Pacific and Gulf coasts where annual precipitation exceeds 1,000 mm.
In this model, 50 ha would be planted to mangoes, replacing the traditional
annual crops of maize and beans. Each subloan would comprise 10
beneficiaries, who would continue to grow maize and beans on another 50 ha
which would not be developed under the investment plan. Under irrigation,
the mangoes would come into bearing in year three with an initial yield of
about 800 kg/ha. At full development in year nine, the yield would
increase to 12.5 t/ha.   Investment items are planting material and
establishment costs (70%) and machinery and equipment (30%). The net
benefits before financing (including the value of labor) for maize and
beans from the 50 ha being developed under the investment plan is
US$10,100; this would increase to US$131,535 at full development. The
financial rate of return is 29% and the economic rate of return is 22%.

TERMS OF REFERENCE OF THE
AGRICULTURAL FINANCIAL SUBSECTOR STUDY
1.        In accordance with the objectives, terms and conditions of the
Ninth Agricultural Credit Project, it is agreed between the Government of
Mexico and the Bank that a study of agricultural sector financing will be
undertaken with the purpose of identifying problem areas, clarifying policy
issuc' and formulating specific recommendations for near-term actions.
2.        This study will be carried out by SHCP with assistance from Banco
de Mexico, SARH and BANRURAL.
3.        There will be four separate but related components of the agricul-
tural sector financing study, which components will be defined as follows:
A.        Descriptive Overview of Agricultural Sector Financing
- Identification of all governmental offices and parastatal
agencies (including credit institutions and crop insurance
schemes)l/ responsible for channeling financial resources to the
agricultural activities;
- Classification and quantification of the sources and uses of the
resources channeled by these institutions in support to the
agrarian sector during the period 1980-1986;
- Comparison of the role of self-financing of resources originating
from retained earnings versus financing derived from loans and
other sources;
- Determination of the financial subsidies granted to the
agricultural sector, through federal budget and other sources;
and
- Evaluation of the financial resources offered to the sector, in
particular, for the different types of agricultural credit.
1/ The review of crop insurance schemes would be a 'best efforts' review.

B.        Functional Analysis of the Agricultural Credit System
Amount of credit channeled by each institution to the different
credit subjects during the period 1980-1986;
- Analysis of the sources and cost of credit granted by credit
institutions for the same period, as well as interest charges and
the periods or terms of the credit granted to different classes
of borrowers;
- Identification and quantification of the subsidies contained in
the different types of agricultural credits channeled to the
different categories of borrowers and types of agricultural
activities; and
- Evaluation of the impact of such subsidies on the productivity of
the beneficiaries and the types of beneficiaries, on the
financial condition of the credit institutions and the structural
adjustment and the Government's marcroeconomic stabilization
programse
C.        Projection and In-Depth Review of FIRA and FICART's Credit Programs
- Detailed analysis of the procedures, programs, problems and
policies governing FIRA and FICART's operations in relation to
the Sociedades Nacionales de Credito (Commercial Banks and
BANRURAL) for 1980-1986;
- Analysis of their financial structures and financial conditions
for 1980-1986 including particularly:
- Quality of their loan portfolios;
- Cost and efficiency of their credit operation; and
- Adequacy of financial accounting and reporting systems;
- Evaluation of FIRA and FICART's operations during 1980-1986 with
relation to the objectives of the Federal Government and the Bank
in agreeing to undertake the Ninth Agricultural Credit Project on
matters including rationalization and curtailment of the credit
subsidies, reversal of institutional decapitalization and
maintenance of their financial integrity; and
- Formulation of detailed, time-phased forward projections of FIRA
and FICART/BANRURAL financial management targets for the
1987-1991 period, with particular reference to requirements for
the financial integrity of these institutions and the prospective
demand for agricultural credit.

D.        Performance Appraisal of Agricultural Sector Financial Institution
(Co=mercial Banks/EANRURAL)
- Establishment of criteria for appraising the functional
effectiveness and operational efficiency of agricultural sector
financial institutions;
- Utilization of these criteria for comparing the effectiveness end
efficiency of all other agricultural credit agencies with JIRA
and FICART;
- Determination of the consistency of operations currently
conducted by agricultural sector financial institutions witi
their statutory mandates on the one hand and with Government's
macroeconomic and sectoral policies on the other hand;
- Economic appraisal of the costs, benefits and incidences of
subsidies conferred on the agricultural sector through financial
institutions; and
- Examination of feasible alternatives for reducing or terminating
subsidization of agricultural sector financing including better
targetting of such remaining subsidies.
The results obtained from these four components of the study will be
integrated by SICP, with particular attention being paid to harmoiaation of
policy recommendations.
4,        The study of agricultural sector financing will be consistent with
the methodology, analyses, and recommendations to be contained in the
GIRA-related financial sector studies--with responsibility for such
coordination to be assumed by SHCP.
