                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is evolving well and is on track to reach the development objectives. The team is in place and well trained. The Municipal commitment to this project is very high. A
                         waste water treatment plant was concluded and works for a new one has just started. 26km of sewerage collectors in the urban center of the city is under way as well as activities to
                         reduce water losses. Works to improve the drainage system in the urban center will start soon.
