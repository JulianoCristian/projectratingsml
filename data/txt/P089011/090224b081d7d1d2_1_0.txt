                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation made progress since last ISR (Nov 2012), however in slower pace than it was expected. The Bank team expressed concern regarding the need for finalizing
                         the activities and works under implementation. Most planned activities and works have been concluded. However, sewerage collectors and macro drainage system in the city center,
                         micro drainage in three neighborhoods, Conquistinha waste water treatment plant and few consultancies are still under way. The conclusion of all activities is expected to December
                         2014 and will be counterpart financed. The Bank is not expecting to supervise these works. Capacity building and monitoring on environmental-related activities are being conducted
                         by the Municipality.
