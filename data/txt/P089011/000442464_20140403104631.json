Loan : Uberaba Agua Viva Project\n            for Brazil were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: in order to provide a timely response to\n            Borrowers' needs, projects contemplating large civil\n            works can be appraised on the basis of conceptual and\n            preliminary engineering designs, but the project's\n            costing, disbursement and implementation schedules need to\n            clearly reflect this. Project design needs to ensure the\n            coordination of civil works interventions so as to minimize\n            their impact on the community. The use of an external\n            management support firm can be positive in transferring\n            knowledge to the local team, but the knowledge transfer can\n            take time and a transition period is needed to ensure the\n            local team is fully operational. Results frameworks need to\n            be designed: (i) candidly to present what a project can\n            actually achieve during its timeframe; and (ii) taking into\n            account Borrowers' capacity for measuring results and\n            the availability of reliable baseline data. The design and\n            implementation of a strong and effective communication plan\n            is a key instrument to address citizen demands regarding\n            impacts from large infrastructure investments. Complex urban\n            development projects can be managed effectively by\n            medium-sized municipalities with a reasonable institutional\n            and operational capacity. An integrated urban water\n            management approach is effective, creates synergies among\n            financing and implementation institutions, and allows local\n            stakeholders to understand project objectives and results.\n            The relevance of the World Bank's assistance for\n            achieving impact and sustainability is high even when it is\n            not the main source of funding."}, "docdt": "2014-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
