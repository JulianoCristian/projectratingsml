The project has three components. 1) Improvement to\n            priority infrastructure and services in Conakry includes a)\n            solid waste management, which will increase the level of\n            garbage collection and limit the impact of waste production;\n            b) neighborhood upgrading, which will support rehabilitation\n            and maintenance operations on Conakry's secondary\n            roads; c) primary road network, which will improve traffic\n            at critical blockage points at Conakry. 2) Assistance to\n            secondary cities will support the decentralization process\n            by helping mayors to better plan for the need of their\n            communes. 3) Institutional strengthening will provide\n            support to operational units and improved financing of\n            priority services, such as solid waste management and\n            secondary road maintenance. It will also finance community\n            outreach programs related to waste management."}, "docdt": "1999-03-24T00:00:00Z"}
