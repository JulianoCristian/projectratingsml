Attached is the report entitled "Project Ccmpletion Report on Niger -
Power Engineering and Technical Assistance Project (Credit 1511-Nfl)" prepared
by the Africa Regional Office.. Neither the Borrower nor the B.nefic±ary
(NIGELEC) contributed their views, though invited to do so.
While the project incurred a delay of three years, its ovetall
outcome is rated as satisfactory and its sustainability as likely. It succeeded
in substantially strengthening the national power utility, NIGELEC, and making
it suitable for handling a follow-on project, The project produced a least cost
investment program for generation that postponed the implementation of the large
Kandaji hydro project, on which the country had concentrated excessive attention
in the past. At project completion, revenues and accounts receivable were not
yet satisfactory but these issues are addressed in the on-going project.,
The Project Completion Report is candid and its conclusions are
appropriate.   The project may be audited upon completion of the follow-on
project.

EDEBR ULMEEGM AN  MME  ASBTAN PROJIECI 
PREFiACE 
This is the PrvJect Completion Report (PCR) for the Power Engineering and
Technical Asstance Proect in Niger, for which Credit 1511-NIR in the amount of SDR 7.2
millon (US$ 7.5 million) was approved on July 19, 1984. The Credit was closed on
December 31, 1991, %=ree yeas behind schedule, when SDR 7.031.547 had been disbursed.
The last disbursement took place on May 6, 1992. The Credit, which represented the first
Bank operation in the Power sector in Nlger was extended to the Government of Niger for
on-lending to the "Societe Nigerienne d'Electricite' (NIGELEC), a predominantly State
owned organization incorported in 1964, which operates the Government-owned power
system assets in Nger on a concessonary basis.
The PCR was prepared by the Industry and Energy Oprations Division of the
Sahelian Department, Africa Regional Office (Prace, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and IE)
and is based, inter alia, on supevion reports, correspondence between the Bank, the
Borrower and the Executing Agency, staisdcal information and other data obtained from
Bank files, and discussions with Bank staff involved in project implementation and
supervision. The Bank sent the Borrower Parts I and III for comments on June 8, 1992 and
the request to prepae Part II on May 22, 1992. No reply has yet been received.



tOWR G ~~NT               C      A ASITNEP
objective
The main objectives of the project, which was the frt in the sector, were to
(i) determine the least-cost long-term program for power development and of power sector
ornizaon; (ii) provide assisnwc to "Societe Nigeriee d'lectricite" (NIGELEC) to
strengthen its intemal organization, maagement, finances, manpower planning and training;
(i1) fince distribution equipment for rilitaton; ad (iv) ppare the neat power project
Project execution was considerably affected by delays in credit efectiveness
due to IDA's rlenshntproblems, inital start-up difficulties due to unliarit of
NIGELEC with Bank procedures and frequent change in management staf, but above all
cumbersome Nigerien pt procedures and substantial lags in disbursement. As a
result project imp      required three years longer than orinly planned. However,
echnically, the project was well designed and implemented hwi only minr adjusments,
although the Borower's     ence with Bank procedures should have been  k  into
account.
The proect achieved most of its main objectives. As a result the project was
instrumental in preventng a huge and uneconomic investment in the hydro-elctic Kandadji
scheme. Furherme, there is a long-term least-cost power development plan, an Electricity
Code, new Statutes for NIGELEC,, a peromance contract between the Government and
NIGELEC, and one between NIGELEC and "Soe Nigerienne de Charbon'
(SONICHAR), a coal mine in the north of Niger, for the sale and supply of electricity by the
latter. NIGELEC employees (14) have received advanced tran  which means a
consderable increase in professional taff. Through rehailition of the distribution network
power supply has become more reiable. New investent needs of about $53 million were
identfied during the praraton of the next power project.
The project has reslted in the creation of a natonal utility with an increased,
and better trained staff of managers, professionals and technicians, improved system



- iUl-
efficiency and a performance contract between the Govament and NIGELEC. IDA through
its folow-up    gy Prect is contributing to the consolidation of the gains made under this
crdit as wll as to the improvment of overall sector efficiency.
The main findings are that:
(i)   the Government now has a long-term development program for its power
sector;
(ii)  the power sector's organization and planning capabilites have been
srenthened; and
(ii)  the financa situaion of NIGELEC has not suctrlly impved.
The main lessons from the project are:
(a)   the Bank could have reduced the delays durng the project preparation phase if
at that time it had insisted on more efficient Nigrien procuement procedures;
(b)   signing of a program-contract between the Government and NIGELEC is not a
suicient condition to guarantee either the management or the financial
autonomy of the utility. As a result -of non-payment of elctricity bills and the
Goverment's interference i NIGELEC management, the udlity's financial
and technical per nce detiorated. Even addressing these issues in a
PESAP context proved -to be ineffectve. Other policy and techncal measu
need to be developed to ensure the utility's financial and manageri autonomy
and effidency.
(c)  the Bank should pay carefdul attention to esdmating disbursement schedules to
match the realities of each Borrowe's adminishative and manerial
constints, in particar when the Borrower has little familiarity with Bank
procedures and large disbursements.
(d) the Bank should more forcefully enforce its Covenants if the Borrower
consistently does not comply with them, in particular by not taking action to
implement structul changes in order to avoid non-compliance recurrence.

2.01        By 1984, when the project was being prepared, te electric power sector in
Niger had prgrssed from a smaU begning in the 1960s to a reasonably well orgaized
suply system. Duing those 20 years, the economic development of the country was to a
lare eent driven by the exploitation of uranium ore deposits in the norther part of Niger,
whic cred an immediate requiment for electic energy in the mining enclave and,
because of the linkae effects of the mining boom in other sectors, raid growth of demand
in the populated rego  of the Niger Valley, (including the capital Niamey), and along the
southem  border with Nigerhi By 1982, the total electical enery requirement was 271
GWh, of which 51% was used in the Niger Valley, 35% in the uranum mining enclave, and
14% in the remaining sconday load centers; the number of low-voWge customers had
reached about 40,000; and up to 30% of the urban population had access to electricity
although, overall, such access was limited to lite more than 3% of the total population.
Households consumed the lion's share of the avalable electricity, .udlizing 36%, with-
industry, both large and small, consmg 32% and public adminisan some 25%.
2.02        Elctity supply in Niger was a state monopoly delegated to thre-
organizations: Sjo   igeine d'lectricite (MIGELEC), Societe Nigeienne de Charbon
(SONICHAR) and Autorite de Barrage de Kandadji (ABK). NIGELEC, which is 95% state
owned, operates state owned power and water systems assets in urban centers as concessions.
SONICHAR was formed to build and operate a coal mine and power plant in the north of the
country ae sells it net geneation t  IGELBC for tamission and distribution to the
uranium mines and to two local Ws. -ABK was an autonomous agency in charge of the
preparation and possible futur implemenion of a major multiputpoxe hydro-electric
developmet, the economic feasibility of whih has yet to be convincingly demonated. The



-2 -
conceson system is conducive to divided ownersip of power assets and oprting
eonsibilites and, consequently, contributed to faggmented power sector planing, as did
the ambiguous wole of ABK as a hydro-power pla  and national development agency. The
oxbination of power and watr supply to urban center withi NIGELEC has, in practice,
led to financial conuion and the support of wate suppy opeations by eletty revenues.
2.03        Them was no natona power system. in 1984, te Niger Valley was supplied
by a geneaig saon at Niamey consisting of two 12 MW gps tubines and four 3 MW
dil sets, and in the north a 32 MW coal fired plant supplied the min  and the two
secy  load centers. This iucture is grealy enhanced by a 132kV tnsmisson line
linkage with the power sem of Nigeria which supplies up to 30 MW of non-fim power.
The contact with Nigria holds good undl 1996 and the prce, which is renegodable every
five years, at t time mthe project was prepared, had stayed well below the cost of electricity
generated t.y the use of petroleum fuels. In recet years, more than 90% of the electical
needs of the Niger Valley have been suppled at gat savings to Niger from Nigeria, but as
line outages may last one or two weeks, ful standby capacity in Niger must be provided.
2.04        Plamed sector develWment in the 1980s focused on the Niger Valley, since
the  was surplus capacity m the northern region, and short term expansion plus aimed at
maintining sufficient standby thermal capacity to cover peak demand while tg  mxmum
advantage of the conta  with Nigeia's National Electric Power Authority (NEPA). A
12MW diesel set was planned for 1985 to be followed by a second, and possibly a third by
the end of the decade. Three indigenous hydro-eectric sources had been identified, although
only the Kandadji project had been studied to technical feasibility level, whose economic
justification herefre remained in doubt.
3.   ec QWects  D= =
3.01        (etWj. The concept of the project emerged from an early 1982
sector survey mission which identified technical assistance needs in three nmjor areas; long-
term power planning, instiudon building and strengtheing of NIGELEC's distribution
operations. The spfic objectives were; to accelera  decisons on the direction of fuure
power development in Niger by defining an optimal sequence of invesatments in electic
power generation and tansmission; to strengthen the orgnizaon, planning capabilities and
financial perfoce of the power sector; to improve system efficiency by rehabilitation and
selective reinforcement of the distibuton system; and to train NIGELEC's staff.
3.02             =. The Credit provided for:
(a)    Power Planning.
i)    a study of the power needs in the Niger VaUey to the year 2020 and of
selected secondary load centers to 1990;



-3-
ii)    onging fot the pepraon of bid documents for the first powe
project in the least-cost development sequence defined by the planing
sudy and accepted fbr implemenain by the Government and by IDA;
and
iii)  the ervices of a planning engineer to assist NIGELEC in the
supervision of the planning study.
(b)   Sector Institutions.
A study of the present and future organizaon of the sector, including a
review of the concession system and of the rolaionship between NIGELEC
and the Govenment.
(c)   NIGELEC.
A study of NIGELEC's longer term organization, management and
mapower requirements - to be coordin  with a program to define
NIGELEC's manpower needs over the near term, financed by Caisse Centrale

(d)   Training:
i)    Taining of those Nigelec technicians who are to fill supervisory
positions in onizaion and management skills, and
ii)   Provision of scholarships for taining future NIGELEC power engineers
at the Ecole Superieure Inticaine d'Electricite (ES).

4.01        The project was identified by a sector survey mison in March 1982, whose
report was discussed with the Goverment in November 1982. The initial project brief was
distributed on February 4, 1983. The project was appraised in March 1983, and negoions



-4-
took place in Washington in May 1984. A Poect Preparton  Facit  (PPF) advance of
US$1 million equivalent was granted in July 1983 to finance the institutional stdy, the inidtal
phase of the planning-Audy, and tWcia assistance to NIOXLEC in bid evaluation, contract
negotiatin, and subsequent admiistraton of the n study.
4.02        The desip and focus of the prcct was not changed in the course of project
implementaion, except for minor adjustments.
5.01        Credit ffecthIenq. and  ject St-up. The credit was negoated in May
1984 and appoved by the Board on July 17, 1984. However, the credit was not signed until
January 15, 1985, beas of non-avaiaility of IDA finds due to rplenishment problems.
Credit effectiveness, therefore, was, exended tll July 15, 1985, one year after Board
approval A delay in the sining of the credit agreement contributed to a late start of the
legal formaiies.
5.02            I _g.  Although the original closing date of the credit was
December 31, 1988 it was necessary to postone this date by three years, and the fin
disbursement date by another four months till April 30, 1992. At the time of the original
Closing Date the undisbursed balance was SDR 3.9 million or 54% of the credit, while a
total of 76% had been committed. The main reasons for the postponement were:
(a)  initial project implemenion difficulties, including delays in project
effecdveness due to non-availability of funds,
0b)   delays in project execution due to unmity with Bank procedres and
cages in personnel; and
(c)   cumberme-pr ement procedures.
5.03    .   a =t. World Bank guidelns were followed in all phases of the
project No significant problems, other than considerable delays incurred, were experienced
during project xcuon.
5.04        Lde t   The estimated prect cost to be financed by iDA was US$7.5
million equivalent, including the refincing of one advance under the PPF (US$1 miDlion
equivalent). The final cost is about US$7.7 million as shown in Table 3 of Part m.
Although the disbursement are higher tan the estimated project cost these are not due to cost
ovenrun but to changes in te raes of exchange. Training cost are included under consultnt
services under every component. The balance of SDR 168,452.96 or US$234,249
equivalent4 was canceled.



S.QS        l;bUrOeMentM. The credit was dow in being disbursed. The estimated and
actual disbursements of Credit 151 1-NIR are presented in Table 3 of Pan m. The slow pace
of disbursements were due to delays in credit effectiveness, slow initial project execution, but
above all by cumbersome Nigerien procurement and disbursement procdures.
6.   PftoC.Resulh.
6.01         Ei            . Most of the project's objectives have been achieved. The
Power Planning study concluded: (i) that there were no mini-hydro sites of interest in Niger;
(i) that the interconnecdon with  geria is the least  solution at least unt the mid-1990s;
(iii) that the Kandadji hydro-project is of no interst before 2015; and (iv) ftat the Ganbou
hydro-project is not required before 1995. The results of the institutional study led t the
dissolution of the ABK in June 1985. NIGELEC was constituted into a national autonmous
utility under the supervision of a Public Sector MmLstry, and not any longer under the
Ministry of Mines, Industry and Energy. Intl changes in NIGELEC organizaton and
management were also made, supported by technical asisance in customer mnagement.
Manpower development pLanning led to tageted taining of NIGELC staff at ESIE.
6.02        kaegit. The power planning study recommends two major projects: the
Ganbou hydro project, to be commissioned in 1995 and the Katsina-Maradi incoMnnection
with Nigeria in 1987. The credit included US$1.5 million for detailed engineering and
preparaion of bid documents for "a next power project", which was always understood to be
the hydro project. Because the study of Ganbou was not urgent in view of the drop in oil
prices and low load growth, it was agreed with the Govement to reseve this amount in the
new energy project, and to mobilize funds under this credit to study the Maradi-Katina
iconnection to bid document stage. This study would also review the feasibility of
immediate or future connecdon of Zinder.
6.03        The sector institutional study produced an electicity code, new statutes for
NIGELEC and a "contrat-programme" between the Govemment and NIGELEC, which
sexves as the legal basis for the opeation of the power sectr. The CCCE fimanced study of
NIGELEC's orgzon, magement and manpower planning recommended an expensive
implementation plan that did not respond to NIGELEC's priorities. At IDA's request
NIGELEC substantiy reduced costs and reoriented the progam, with heavy emphasis on
billing, collecting and accounting functions. Puat of the execution of this progam was co-
financed by IDA. In additon to financing the traiing program aimed at long-term
manpower development IDA also financed two experts who assisted NIGELEC in customer
management. A total of 14 students compled tir studies at ESIE with IDA scholrships.
6.04        In view of the new interconnection with Nigeria, the high connection charges
that discouraged commercial development of the power market, and the inadequate rate
structure of SONICHAR, a tariff review was carned out. NIGELEC also signed a contract
with SONICHAR by which NIGELEC leased to SONICHAR the 132 kV trnmission line
between Anou Araren and Akokan for five years.

6.05        During the period of project eecution tbere was a chage of Director-General
at three occasions, which negatively effected the _a t of the udlity. This negtive
development was compounded in 1988 when al NIGELEC drecto  were removed from
their poets and demoted, wile now pess were appointed in  er functions. Tis sitadion
has led to a loss of experenced staff, lack of discipline among staff, more peronnel and
higher labor costs.
-6.06       im.c of   .       nThe project has enabled the Government to constitute a
national power sctr entity, with a bett orgnizatin and management suctue. Also, it
helped train 14 NIGELEC professional saff. Finally, the project resulted in the
identfication of a follow-up investment program of US$53 million for the power sector.
7.     uinii
7.01        Due to the project, Niger has a better oganized and managed power udlity
with tained managers and technicians which will enaWe NIGELEC to increa  sector
efficiency. In theory, NIGELEC also has acquired a large measure of manageria and
ftnancial autonomy through the agreement on a program contact between the Goverment
and NIGELEC.
7.02        To suain the gins realized under this credit, IDA coniinues to suot the
least-cost development of a well-managed power sector through a Second Energy Project (Cr.
1880-NIR).. Currendyt, the Bank in collaboration with NGELEC is undng a thorugh
review of the power secto; in generl and of NIGELEC in parcula, with a view to bring
about insttional and manageral improvements.

8.01        Through the Power Engineering and Technical Assistnce Project, IDA has
made a positive contrbution to the long-term least-cost approach of power sector
development, and to a better development of ipstitional, manpower and investment
planning. R also provided the necewsay leadehip -to attract other fianciers to invest in the
power sector, who were reluctant to go it alone. Further, IDA contributed to the taining of
much needed manageial and technal staff, as well as to the iiion of the tariff.
8.02        With IDA help a good project has been prepared, which was able to achieve
most of its objectves. The Borrower's staff, NIGELEC managers and technicans, as wel
as the consultants were suprve of the project's objectives and instrumental in thir
reaniz,ion.
8.   BorrowedrD
8.01        Table 7, Part III, provides a summary of the Borrower's performance in
-complying wit covenants. The Govemment and NIGELBC, with suppo¢t of their

sector ectricity bill; plan to reduce recivables; sef-f4naning rtio; audits), after initial
compliace, were not compied with.

project.
