   Note: In the above updated TA procurement plan, since now is the mid implementation of the Non-MDI project, some TAs are suggested to
   be cancelled by SWG, which are non-MDI-LC-6, non-MDI-LC-7, and non-MDI-ST-1. During the project implementation, it is difficult for
   SWG to speed up the project implementation due to the lack of the public awareness, so the TA of non-MDI-LC-8, which is Awareness
   Creating Activities and Public Information is decided to be enhanced, and the budget is added to USD 90,000.
