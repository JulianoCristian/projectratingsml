                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The global environmental objectives of the project have been completed. All ODS covered by the ODS IV project has been phased out since the end of 2009. Nevertheless the
                         closing date of the project was extended to 20 June 2013 in order to accommodate implementation and completion of the pharmaceutical aerosol sector plan and demonstration
                         projects to phase out HCFCs (two recently added activities).

                         To date, the total disbursement reaches $421.8 million. There is an undisbursed balance of $2.42 million.

                         Residual demand of ODSs in the pharmaceutical aerosol industry is met by the stockpile built up before the end of 2009. All pharmaceutical enterprises have signed ODS phase-out
                         contracts with FECO. Non-ODS alternatives of about 70% of pharmaceutical applications have been identified and are being reviewed by the State Food and Drug Administration
                         (SFDA). Remaining stocks of CFCs are sufficient to meet the demand in this industry until SFDA's approvals are granted (expected in 2013). This residual demand does not pose
                         any risk to sustainability of the achievement of the global environmental objectives.

                         The HCFC demonstration projects are progressing as planned.
