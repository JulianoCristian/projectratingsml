                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The global environmental objectives of the project have been achieved. All ODS covered by the ODS IV project has been phased out since the end of 2009. There are activities
                         under the project which are still ongoing: (a) HCFC Phase-out in the PU Foam Demonstration Projects which is on track and will complete all activities prior to the closing date; (b)
                         Pharmaceutical Aerosol Sector Plan which has been delayed but a ban on the use of CFCs in pharmaceutical aerosols products is scheduled to be issued on January 1, 2013; and
                         (c) Halon Sector Plan under which a survey and registration of existing halon installation is planned.

                         Activities under the HCFC Phase-out Demonstration Projects have been completed for the solar water heater application; while for spray foam, the enterprise is awaiting verification
                         by an independent expert. On the hydrocarbon system house demonstration project, the three pilot enterprises are at varying stages in the conversion process and expect to
                         complete all activities prior to the Closing Date.

                         There has been some delay in the activities for the pharmaceutical aerosol sector plan. However, the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) is expected to issue a ban on the
                         use of CFCs in pharmaceutical aerosol products on January 1, 2013 and will enter into force on June 21, 2013. A time-bound action plan has been agreed to ensure that all
                         activities will be completed.

                         Under the Halon Sector Plan, it was agreed to limit the survey on halon installation to one rather than 15 provinces and the survey is expected to be completed in five months. An
                         EIA will need to be undertaken to ensure proper management under the hazardous waste regulation.
                         To date, the total disbursement reaches $421.8 million. There is an undisbursed balance of $901,023.
