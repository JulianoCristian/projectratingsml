                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is fully on target. World Bank-financed independent verification has confirmed that China met all its Ozone DepletingSubstance (ODS) phase-out targets under the
                         project by the end of 2009 as required. By January 1, 2010, when the total phase-out obligation under the Protocol for chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halons, and carbon tetrachloride
                         (CTC) came into force for "Article 5," i.e. developing countries, China figured as the most prominent contributor to the phase-out successes under financial mechanism of the Montreal
                         Protocol not only in terms of ODS, but in terms of emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs).
