"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Fourth Montreal Protocol\n            Ozone Depleting Substances Phaseout Project for China were\n            as follows: outcomes were highly satisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was low; Bank performance was highly\n            satisfactory and borrower performance was also highly\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: Ozone Depleting\n            Substance (ODS) production issues should be tackled in a\n            more upstream manner within the context of ODS phaseout\n            strategies. Addressing the phase-out of ODS at the sector\n            level is a more rational and cost effective manner by which\n            to curb large, non-uniform and dispersed consumption and\n            production of ODS. The use of a three pronged phase-out\n            approach that supports policy development, technical\n            assistance activities and the financing of ODS phase-out on\n            at enterprise level based on annual sector reduction targets\n            addresses the key aspects of sustainable management of\n            complex sectoral or national initiatives. The modular nature\n            of the umbrella modality stipulated within the\n            project's Grant Agreement (GA) was a key in supporting\n            the aforementioned point, though it was strongly reinforced\n            by the addition of a standardized sectoral phase-out\n            approach. Performance-based programming, where funds are\n            released annually based on pre-determined phase-out\n            schedules, targets, and specific performance indicators\n            having been met, provides an excellent implementation\n            structure with which to motivate and incentivize\n            stakeholders to find the most cost effective ways to convert\n            to non-ODS technologies or to phase-out ODS production.\n            Investment in the development and effective management of a\n            comprehensive Management Information System (MIS),\n            complemented by verification of both financial records\n            (conducted by the national audit body) and technical results\n            by World Bank experts, are key to gauging the accuracy of\n            results generated."}, "docdt": "2013-12-17T00:00:00Z"}
