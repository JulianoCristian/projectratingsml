Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators(as approved)
The project objective is to assist the Recipient in carrying out its Country Program so as to phase-out
ODS Consumption within it territory.
Revised Global Environment Objectives (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
Indicators and reasons/justifications
Clarification of "Consumption" was made at the time of the 2005 GA amendment (discussed in Section
1.6 of this ICR) to state the GEO as: The project objective is to assist the Recipient in carrying out its
Country Program so as to phase-out ODS Consumption (defined as production, export, and import of
ODS) within it territory.

﻿1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
The Montreal Protocol
The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (MP) is a multilateral environmental
agreement that was adopted in 1987 in response to growing global recognition that concerted international
action was required to protect the earth's ozone layer, a stratospheric level filter that shields the earth and
protects human and ecosystem health from the sun's dangerous ultraviolet radiation.
The Protocol established time-bound targets to reduce the production and consumption of various ODS
including: (i) chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) used in refrigeration, and aerosol, solvents, and foam
applications; (ii) halons used in fire protection; (iii) carbon tetrachloride (CTC) used as a cleaning agent
and as process agent; and (iv) methyl chloroform (trichloroethane, TCA) used as an industrial solvent.
The reduction and phase-out targets for the production and consumption of these ODS are shown in
Tables l.a. and 1.b., below.
China acceded to the Montreal Protocol on June 14, 1991 and has since acceded to, or accepted
(equivalent legal effect as ratification) the Protocol's four subsequent amendments. Accession to the
Protocol made China eligible to receive grant funding from the Protocol's financial mechanism, the
Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol (MLF), to support its ODS phase-out
targets.

The elimination of ODS production and consumption in developed countries in 1995 resulted in China
becoming the world's global leader in ODS production and consumption. By 1995, China's ODS
production had exceeded 100,000 metric tons and consumption was in the order of 92,000 metric tons.
Both production and consumption were principally concentrated in four substances: CFC-11, CFC-12,
CTC and halon 1211. Five major industrial sectors accounted for virtually all of China's ODS use: foams,
1


﻿refrigeration and air-conditioning, aerosols, fire protection and solvents. Although all had their own
distinct profiles, the sectors shared a number of important common characteristics that influenced ODS
China's strategy and phase-out policies, namely: rapid industrial growth; geographic dispersion of
enterprises; growing profitability of ODS production; non-competitiveness of ODS alternatives due to
safety concerns and/or limited commercial availability; inadequate policy/regulatory framework and
enforcement mechanisms; and, competition from multinational corporations.
In order to receive financial assistance from the MLF, in 1993 China prepared a Country Program (CP)
with the assistance of UNDP. This strategic framework document outlined policies and actions associated
with enabling China to maintain compliance with the MP phase-out targets. In so doing, the CP
established a Government commitment to a complete phase-out of controlled ODS by 2010, in
accordance with the Protocol's phase-out targets, provided that sufficient funds to support incremental
costs and the technologies required to achieve a sustainable transition to alternatives were made available.
Three ODS phase-out projects were approved for Bank implementation successively over the years 1993-
1995 within the context of the CP. The third, ODS III, introduced the umbrella grant agreement modality'
which had been created specifically for the Bank's Montreal Protocol investment activities. Under this
instrument, grant commitments were not received upfront but based rather on MLF sub-project approvals
on a case-by-case basis, over the life of the agreement, which allowed for the development of additional
MLF-funded sub-projects, as required, to assist the Government in meeting its MP phase-out targets. Yet,
this was a time-consuming and costly approach, taking into account the number of ODS-using producers
and companies in China. In addition, this approach did not allow for control of ODS production and
consumption at the national level.
Project Background
The aim of the ODS IV project was to assist China in meeting its obligations under the Montreal Protocol.
The Project was financed by the MLF of the MP and represented a new approach to ODS phase-out
within the Bank's MP operations. Until 1995, the standard approach to ODS phase-out had centered on
the identification of individual companies producing or using ODS, then financing their ODS phase-out
based on stand-alone sub-project activities within the context of a World Bank MP umbrella project
(OP/BP 10.21; see more on OP/BP 10.21 under Rationale for World Bank Support to China's ODS
Phase-out Objectives in Section 1.1. below). However, as overall ODS consumption at the national level
remained un-controlled2, and continued to involve numerous sectors and enterprises, the sub-project
modality did not allow for, nor ensure, a comprehensive approach through which to achieve the sustained
aggregate reductions of ODS necessary to achieve the Protocol's phase-out targets in a timely manner.
The ODS IV Project approach sought to address this hurdle.
The Project's implementation modality was innovative from both the perspective of MLF-funded
activities and World Bank MP operations. The main features of the ODS IV Project included:
*   Adoption of a sector level approach: The phase-out of ODS at the sector level provided the
Government with a more comprehensive management tool with which to curb ODS consumption and
production. Sector level phase-out was addressed through a combination of policies, technical
assistance activities and the financing of ODS phase-out on a sub-project level based on annual
sector reduction targets alone.
This modality was subsequently adopted in all World Bank MP Operations worldwide.
2
While on the one hand, the sub-project approach was capable of phasing-out a defined amount of ODS production consumption, its
limitation was that in tandem, other ODS-using companies could be increasing their ODS production and consumption given the lack of
a more structured sectoral and national approach to phase-out.
2


﻿*   Sectors were treated as discreet components under the Project: The modular nature of the
umbrella modality contained within the Project's Grant Agreement (GA) allowed for the inclusion of
additional sectors as each was approved by the MLF ExCom by treating them as discreet Project
components, each with its own approved budget and MLF reporting requirements. This allowed all
the parts of the Project to be implemented on a component basis, as well as part of the larger program
objective outlined in China's CP to phase-out ODS consumption within the country.
*   Performance-based disbursements directly to the Chinese ODS account: Specific verifiable
performance targets were developed for each Project component (i.e. each ODS Sector Plan). As per
the GA between China and the Bank, disbursements were issued in four tranches per year for each
component, based on confirmation that the performance targets outlined in the components' ExCom
Agreements had been met and verified.
*   Bidding for financing of ODS phase-out: Funding of sub-project activities was based on an annual
bidding approach for each component (sector). Eligible enterprises were invited to submit proposals
for ODS phase-out to be achieved, along with a cost breakdown. Enterprises offering the lowest cost
per kg of ODS were selected and offered ODS phase-out contracts. If the reduction offered by ODS-
using companies in a sector was insufficient to meet the phase-down target, the allowable amount of
ODS production and consumption for that sector was nevertheless, reduced in accordance with the
agreed target for the components for the year in order to ensure compliance with the ExCom
agreement and MP targets.
*   Disbursements at the sub-project level: The sub-project contracts that were signed under each
component (sector) were managed by the client. As opposed to reimbursing actual expenditures,
'ODS phase-out contracts' were initiated and disbursements were issued based on performance, the
achievement of verifiable milestones. Unspent funds that remained upon the successful completion of
Project components were retained by the Government and used to support the country's ongoing
ODS programming in line with CP objectives.
*   Verification of ODS consumption for each ODS sector within the aggregate at the national
level: The sector plan modality allowed for national ODS production and consumption levels, by
sector, to be established under each ODS component and to be verified by the Bank.
*   Establishment of a Project level Management Information System informed by MIS developed
for each Project component: The Project-level MIS was a comprehensive monitoring and reporting
tool that was informed by the MIS established under each Project component (sector). This allowed
FECO to accurately report data at the national level in line with China's reporting obligations to the
Ozone Secretariat under Article 7 of the Protocol3, as well as at the sectoral and aggregate levels to
MEP management, to the MLF Secretariat, as per each component's ExCom agreement, and for the
purposes of the Bank's independent verification and reporting requirements, as called for in the GA.
Rationale for World Bank Support to China's ODS Phase-out Objectives
Since 1991, the World Bank has been an implementing agency of the MLF in China, along with UNDP,
UNEP and UNIDO. The Bank's overall ODS Phase-out Program has formed part of a larger effort
underway within the Bank to help China reverse environmental degradation stemming from its rapid
industrialization process, and its reliance on antiquated polluting technologies and undervalued resources.
The Bank's focus on economic development, while ensuring environmental sustainability, placed it in a

Article 7 of the Montreal Protocol addresses the reporting of Data by Parties. It stipulates, writ large, that each Party shall provide to
the Ozone Secretariat, within three months of becoming a Party or not later than three months after the date when the provisions set out
in the Protocol with regard to the substances enter into force for a Party, statistical data on its production, imports and exports of each of
the Protocol's controlled substances, or the best possible estimates of such data where actual data are not available. Follow this link for

﻿good position to support ODS phase-out, where sustained and sustainable industrial expansion would
need to include environmental considerations.
Strong working relations between the Government of China and the Bank during the ODS I-III projects
led to very effective cooperation in the preparation of the ODS IV Project concept and elaboration of its
sector plans. Given the Bank's comparative advantage in supporting large-scale, complex projects, the
capacity of its ODS technical and policy team, and the opportunity to link environmental efforts more
closely with development objectives spelled out in the country's World Bank 1997 Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS), the Bank remained an important partner for ODS phase-out in China. Environmental
protection figured as one of the five major themes outlined in the CAS, and the ODS IV Project
responded directly to a number of the CAS' thematic objectives: 1) the strategy called for environmental
objectives to be pursued through the use of economic incentives and environmental taxes housed within
clear regulatory frameworks, 2) for industrial pollution to be controlled throughout production processes;
and 3) for Montreal Protocol projects to take an increasingly sectoral approach.
1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The project objective (as expressed in Schedule 1 of the original Grant Agreement) is to assist the
Recipient in carrying out its Country Program so as to phase-out ODS Consumption within it territory.
1.3 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
Clarification of "Consumption" was made at the time of the 2005 GA amendment (discussed in Section
1.6 of this ICR) to state the GEO as: The project objective is to assist the Recipient in carrying out its
Country Program so as to phase-out ODS Consumption (defined as production, export, and import of
ODS) within it territory.
. The Project's key indicators were not revised.
1.4 Main Beneficiaries
Division 3 within the Foreign Economic Cooperation Office (FECO) of the Ministry of Environmental
Protection (MEP) was assigned as the Project Management Office (PMO) for the Project. In addition,
domestic implementing agencies (DIA), as defined in the GA, were hired by FECO to assist the PMO in
the implementation of the Project.
The main beneficiaries targeted by the Project were ODS-using and producing enterprises who would
receive financing to cover the incremental costs of either cessation of production of ODS controlled by
the MP or conversion from the use of ODS in the manufacturing process to non-ODS technologies.
Locally, Chinese consumers were also seen to be beneficiaries as a result of the expected growth and
availability in the market of higher quality consumer products.
Government officials from FECO and, more broadly, the Ministry of Environmental Protection
(MEP/SEPA) which is responsible for overseeing implementation of activities to ensure that China meets
its obligations under the Protocol, as well as the seventeen (17) members of the National Leading Group
4


﻿for Ozone Layer Protection (NLG)4, composed of central Ministries and state commissions, were viewed
as beneficiaries. As the project evolved with the addition of additional sectors not initially foreseen at the
concept stage, partner beneficiaries such as the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) were also
introduced. At the provincial level, Environmental Protection Bureaus (EPBs) and Fire Fighting Bureaus
(FFBs), and a number of municipalities who became involved in the Project over time, were considered to
benefit from the Project's implementation.
The Project was also expected to provide direct global benefits by helping China eliminate consumption
and production of ODS which in turn, contributed to improving the health of the ozone layer and reduced
the negative health effects associated with its depletion including, skin cancers, immune system
deficiencies, eye cataracts in human beings and animals, as well as damage to agricultural crops and
marine organisms. A secondary direct global benefit of ODS phase-out is the reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions, due to the high global warming impact of ODS chemicals (see section 3.5.c).
1.5 Original Components
The Project, as originally approved, consisted of two parts. No breakdown of funds was indicated at the
outset against the original GA value of US $100 million, as it was understood that financing requirements
would be addressed by each of the sector plans individually. Institutional and financial arrangements
under the umbrella grant were designed to be applicable across sectors, to the extent possible, based on
the first sector plan approved in November 1997, the US $62 million Halon Sector Plan.
Part A: Reduction of ODS
This component sought to support the reduction of ODS consumption in ODS sectors through the
preparation and implementation of Annual Programs (APs).
Part B: Institutional Strengthening
The component was designed to provide technical assistance to help strengthen the management and
operational capability of MEP, the Agency (DIAs) and other departments and agencies of the Recipient in
accordance with APs through the provision of training and consultants/ services.
1.6 Revised Components
The Project objective was not substantially revised during Project implementation however, clarification
of the reference to 'consumption' was introduced into the Project objective at time of the 2005 GA
amendment (see Section 1.7 below) in order to clarify its coverage of the production aspect of the ODS
phase-out effort. In addition, two activities were added under Part A of Schedule 1 of the GA in order to
accommodate investment activities approved by the ExCom including, the development and production
of ODS substitutes and the establishment of a formal central management unit for China's national ODS
program as follows:
Part A Reduction of ODS
4
The NLG was established with the National Environmental Protection Agency (became SEPA, then MEP) as the Lead Agency
authorized to manage all ozone activities in China. Its membership included: NEPA, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
State Economic and Trade Commission, State Planning Commission, State Science and Technology Commission, State Custom Bureau,
Ministry of Public Security, Ministry of Chemical Industry, Ministry of Machinery Industry, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of
Electronics Industry, Ministry of Internal Trade, National Council on Light industry, China Tobacco Monopoly Bureau, China Aviation
Industry Company, and China Aerospace Industry Company.

﻿Reduction of ODS Consumption in ODS Sectors through:
*   Part A.2. - The development and production of substitutes for ODS' that were in conformity with
appropriate environmental standards.
*   Part A.3. - The establishment of a China Convention Compliance Center to implement and
manage obligations of the Recipient under the Montreal Protocol, including the purchase or
leasing of an office building (in whole or part) and financing of the incremental operating costs of
such Center.
During the life of the Project, a total of 10 sector plans, covering both ODS production and consumption,
were approved, eight of which were approved as multi-year, performance-based projects. The remaining
two projects (MAC and I&CR sectors, see Table 2), were approved as individual sector plan projects. For
these, total funding was provided by the ExCom up-front as opposed to on a multi-year basis. Relevant
production and consumption phase-out indicators were included in each multi-year, performance-based
sector plan approval, aligned with the targets contained in the ExCom Sector Plan Agreements, as well as
for the two sector plans approved as individual projects (Table 2).

Of note, this allowed the project to contribute financing towards the development of HFC- 134a production in China in an effort to
ensure the sustainable phase-out of CFC in the mobile air-conditioning (MAC) sector (see Annex 2, Section A.2.2.)

1.7 Other significant changes
Grant Agreement Amendments and Closing Date Extension: The original Grant Agreement (GA),
dated December 5, 1997, was approved with a funding ceiling of US $100 million as a performance- and
policy-based instrument. Over the life of the ODS IV umbrella project, the GA was amended three times,
by request of the Government:
1) November 20, 2001 - an amendment was introduced to increase the GA grant amount to US $350
million in order to accommodate imminent new sector plan approvals.
2) January 20, 2005 - a second amendment was introduced to further increase the GA grant amount by
US $90 million, to a total of US $440 million, to accommodate the financing of additional new sector
approvals, as well as new activities not originally anticipated.
3) June 29, 2011 - a level 2 restructuring was approved to allow a 24-month extension of the Project's
Closing Date, to June 20, 2013, in order to allow sufficient time to complete the final activity under
significant and would continue to grow and impact the ozone layer if no action was taken. The Decision also stipulates that the
incremental costs of a range of cost-effective measures, such as, process conversions, plant closures, emissions control technologies and
industrial rationalization, to reduce emissions of controlled substances from process-agent uses in Article 5 Parties to levels set under the
Protocol, were eligible for funding in accordance with the rules and guidelines of the MLF ExCom. For more information, see link:

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
The project sought to assist China carrying out its Country Program so as to phase-out ODS consumption.
The ODS IV Project was unique in that it did not have a dedicated project appraisal document (PAD)
prepared. Rather, the concept for the umbrella grant agreement was approved based on the design of the
first (halon) of ten sector strategies that would, over time, be approved by the ExCom and introduced
under the Project's umbrella financing modality. While this represented a first for the Bank's China ODS
operations, the design of the Project concept is nevertheless considered to have been sound. The Project's
aims and structure were a direct and appropriate response to China's interest in efficiently and cost-
effectively addressing its compliance requirements under the MP, while moving beyond a project-by-
project implementation modality. While the latter has its uses, this approach has limitations in large,
complex, fast-growing economies, such as China as it failed to encourage strategic phase-out and made
potential sector-level savings difficult to capture.
The Project's design was innovative and ambitious. It was also more complex than the previously funded
MLF projects that the Bank had implemented in China as it represented the country's largest and most
complicated ODS phase-out initiative, involving many government agencies from both the central and
provincial levels, as well as myriad enterprises from the production and manufacturing sectors.
The goal outlined in the Memorandum of Recommendation to the Director (MOD) was to craft the ODS
IV Project into the primary China-World Bank ODS vehicle leading to the January 1, 2010 phase-out
objective. In so doing, the Project sought to integrate and build upon key operational experiences and
lessons that had been learned by the client, stakeholders and the Bank during the implementation of the
earlier ODS I - III operations. At design stage, the need to move beyond the traditional project-by-project
financing scheme used under the MLF was recognized, along with the need to initiate a comprehensive
phase-out strategy that could tackle the scope of the effort required to maintain compliance. The tool
designed, the sector plan, provided greater flexibility in project design, its results could be more easily
monitored in the aggregate, thereby facilitating assessment of China's compliance status against its MP
targets, and it encouraged the uptake of a comprehensive capacity building effort through engagement and
training across entire sectors.
The consolidation of phase-out activities by sector was considered sustainable, given the totality of the
approach and the Government's commitment to its compliance obligations. The MOD nevertheless, did
identify possible risks associated with the Project's implementation. For one, the overall sector funding
level to be agreed 'in principle' by the ExCom for the first sector plan could fall short of negotiated
expectations. The possibility of substantially reduced funding would undermine China's ability to
implement its ODS phase-out efficiently, as well as erode the nature of MLF funding, whose conditions
include availability of grant funds to cover 'incremental costs' and accessibility of substitute technologies.
This risk was however, not particular to China, but threatened the entire global ODS program as thus,
went beyond the scope of the Project. Reliant on the global community's commitment to objectives of the
Protocol, this risk depended on the level of international funding being appropriate to generate intended
international benefits.
8


﻿At design, the Project team accurately captured the principal implementation-specific risk, which centered
on the possibility that China would not be able to phase-out according to the agreed sector timeframes, in
the first instance for the halon sector, as well as for future sectors approved. The use of the performance-
based sector approach, underpinned by the submission of independent verification reports and annual
plans to the ExCom, mitigated this risk as it ensured that each sector plan underwent stringent ongoing
monitoring and evaluation year to year. In the case that failure to achieve a phase-out target nevertheless
resulted, an ExCom penalty would deduct future funding based on a specific calculation formula.
In addition, at the design stage much attention was paid to ensuring that the institutional and financial
arrangements associated with the first sector plan approved were designed to be applicable across other
sectors in future, to the extent possible. This offered the Government more streamlined and flexible
management of funds within, and between, the various ODS sector plans. With respect to new sectors
being included, the structure of the ODS IV Project, with its rolling sector plan submissions, its emphasis
on Annual Plan (AP) submissions by sector plan, and its performance-based funding disbursement
scheme, effectively ensured an ongoing quality at entry process throughout the Project's duration. The
Project's technical assistance (TA) components supported this process by emphasizing capacity building
through implementation. Overall, the Project established a very efficient supervision model, supported a
highly structured, committed and effective management structure.
A Quality of Entry Assessment carried out by the Bank-internal Quality Assurance Group (QAG),
assisted by specialized reviewers (i.e. environment, financial and social experts, and circulated in
February 2000 lauded the Bank team's adoption of such an innovative approach to implementation,
noting in particular how its structural design allowed the specificities of phase-out work in each sector to
be negotiated between the Government, relevant authorities and producers/enterprises directly within
integrated, annual programs, thereby attributing responsibility for compliance across all relevant parties.
The assessment acknowledged the atypical nature of the Project vis a vis typical Bank operations, given
its long-term program - pre-determined by the MP - with annual approval of work program and grant
allocations, its lack of a project appraisal document (PAD), of internal Bank peer review, and approval at
VP level. Nevertheless, it was judged to be an excellent operation.
The Panel further noted that while there was no existing standard against which to judge the Project, they
believed the ODS IV Project should set the standard for ODS programming and rated it "highly
satisfactory," for the following reasons:
*   the high quality of technical and analytical work being carried out under the operation and the
"rolling design" concept, which allowed for each year's work plan to be constantly refined and
fine-tuned as a direct result of intense supervision, akin to an annual quality at entry exercise.
*   the innovative sectoral approach to implementation that had been developed and negotiated with
the Chinese authorities which set annual output reduction objectives, but left the modalities
developing agreements with individual producers under the management of the Government, as
part of its integrated ODS program. The Panel noted that the ExCom was initially skeptical of this
approach but had come to realize its more cost-effective nature, as the full long term costs was
known.
*   the fact that the Bank team added real value by recognizing that the ODS phase-out program was
not just a command and control process, but one in which policies and economic incentives were
critical to both enterprise compliance, conversion and future viability. By introducing tradable
CFC quotas, technical assistance for considering alternative production possibilities and other
measures, the Project gave individual enterprises the principal responsibility for their own
compliance and reconstruction strategy.
9


﻿* the energy, enthusiasm, commitment and continuity of the Bank Project team whose standards of
design and oversight had set the standards for ODS projects both within the Bank and amongst
the other Implementing Agencies of the MP.
Overall, given the unique aspects of this operation, the Panel acknowledged that it was not clear how the
Project could define "best practice" and be made applicable to other Bank operations, but nevertheless,
felt that QAG should take special note of its excellent performance. The assessment concluded that, "By
any measure, the effort is "Highly Satisfactory.""
2.2 Implementation
The China ODS IV Phase-out Project supervision schedule took its cue from the compliance targets
stipulated by the Protocol (see Annex 9, Summary of Control Measures), with final completion targeted
by June 30, 2011. In total, Project implementation took nearly sixteen years and consisted in the
successful completion of nine (9) discreet ODS phase-out sector plans (4 production, 5 consumption), an
accelerated phase-out plan (APP), and served as a vehicle through which to undertake demonstration and
preparatory work in the sector of new Annex C, Group 1 substances (HCFCs). Through implementation
of the nine sector plans and the APP, the Project was fully successful in meeting its objective of assisting
the Government in carrying out its Country Program so as to phase-out the use of ODS (Annex A and B
substances) within its territory (see Annex 10, Article 7 Reporting, 1997-2012). This was achieved
through (a) the introduction of innovative policy and financing mechanisms, (b) the uptake of sector-
appropriate technology measures, and (c) the institutional strengthening of responsible governmental
entities at the State, provincial and local levels, as well as relevant sector stakeholders.
Innovation in the application ofpolicy and financing mechanisms for ODS phase-out
The umbrella modality sector approach initiated under ODS IV is considered to have been an
appropriately flexible and efficient implementation model. Over the life of the Project, the Project was
amended twice and the total funding level of the umbrella Grant Agreement was revised to $440 million.
While the total funding level was $440 million, funds were released to China only when they were
approved by the ExCom. Since the ExCom only approved $424.4 million to all activities covered by the
Project, this amount was disbursed in full to China. The nationally executed, multi-year, performance-
based nature of the Project was equally important as it cemented an inclusive policy-driven approach
supported by financial incentive that was considered necessary to allow the country to gain long-term
control of its large and complex ODS market and ensure a sustainable phase-out. Given that activities
were implemented through a long period of time, ODS phase-out situations changed over time.
Adjustments to the plan were anticipated. Hence, the Project was designed to allow China with flexibility
to adjust its plans in order to better respond to changing environments. This is critical for ensuring timely
and sustainable phase-out, and effective use of the grant funds.
All sector plans were developed based on pre-determined phase-out schedules in accordance with, at a
minimum, Protocol control measures, and specific sector performance indicators. Compensation was
provided once annual phase-out targets had been met. A two-step reporting system, including a national
independent performance audit conducted by the National Audit Office of the People's Republic of China
(CNAO) and an independent verification conducted by the Bank, was instituted for all sector activities in
order to confirm that phase-out objectives, as planned and as reported completed, had been achieved. As a
means of incentivizing sector grant fund recipients to remain on track with sector plan objectives, written
into each sector plan agreement were penalty clauses that could be applied in the case of non-compliance,
based on a dollar/kg of phase-out not achieved basis.
10


﻿Tradable production quota systems were developed for the phase-out in the ODS production sectors for
halons, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), carbon tetrachloride (CTC), and methyl chloroform (trichloroethane,
or TCA). The quota systems were the main policy tools used to enforce production ceilings imposed
under each sector. Only established producers were entitled to such quotas which prevented the entry of
new producers into the various sector markets. The tradable nature of the systems facilitated the exchange
of quotas amongst the producers themselves, which provided flexibility at the enterprise level. In
addition, the Project supported the establishment of a bidding system in conjunction with the issuance of
production quotas. ODS producers were encouraged to sell their quotas, or portions of them, to MEP
(SEPA) in return for a negotiated amount of grant funds. The Government set the level of the bidding
prices by unit ODS reduction, and winning bids were selected based on offers that proposed to reduce the
ODS at the lowest cost. Also referred to as the quota buy-back system, this allowed the Government to
meet annual production phase-out targets in the most cost-effective manner possible. The halon sector
plan also introduced another innovative market instrument, the auction, which allowed a more efficient
delivery of grants to producers who were willing to accelerate their halon production closure.
In terms of disbursement, the structure of the ODS IV Project allowed for the grant financing to be
released to the client in a fluid and constant manner four times per year, based on the verified
achievements of each sector's previous year performance.
Building capacity through enhanced national execution
The Project strongly supported reinforcing the capacity of China's PMO. Although well established, and
having benefited from capacity-building from previous Projects under the Bank's China ODS portfolio,
as well as from other agencies, the novel implementation approach adopted for the ODS IV Project called
for further enhancement of the PMO's capacity. In order to attract staff, avoid high turnover, build
institutional memory and coordinate efforts across and between sector teams, MEP adopted an integrated
management approach which was crucial to holding the various pieces of the Project together and
building knowledge in a constructive and retainable manner. For every ODS sector addressed, MEP's
Ozone Unit established sector management teams that comprised ministry staff (from relevant ministries),
technical experts, and local implementing agencies. Training on project management, procurement
procedures, and safeguard policies was provided for each sector plan's PMO, as was guidance on linking
their financial record-keeping with the MIS on the national ODS program in order to eliminate manual
input of such data and to facilitate access to aggregate level statistics. Training was also provided to the
domestic implementing agencies (DIAs) engaged by MEP to support enterprise level implementation. At
approximately the Project's mid-point, MEP acknowledged that further devolution of ODS phase-out
management and supervision to the provincial and municipal levels would reinforce implementation of
the country's overall ODS strategy. Local EPBs and authorities, it was felt, could better ensure
enforcement of ODS regulations. The support provided to establish the China Convention Compliance
Center (CCCC) is a testament to the importance attributed to the MEP/FECO's role and the value of
consolidating effort in support of ongoing management of the ODS regime.
The Project also sought to enhance capacity at the level of enterprises by introducing a self-monitoring
program within the ODS producing sectors. Under this scheme, ODS producers designated monitoring
representatives from amongst their technical personnel to be stationed in the production plants of
competitors with the sole task of maintaining independent monthly ODS production records, the idea
being that cross-surveillance was a useful incentive to control the possibility of over-production by legally
registered ODS producers. Regular rotation amongst the different producers was enforced. This was
another innovative way of engaging stakeholders more broadly in support of China's ODS phase-out
strategy.
11


﻿2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
Management Information Systems (MIS). With the growth and expanded complexity that the ODS IV
structure brought to the World Bank-China ODS program, it was apparent that a MIS was a necessary
monitoring and management tool to track progress of all sector phase-out plans and annual programs. The
Project successfully created MIS, by sector, to track implementation as part of its broader monitoring and
reporting system. Sector-relevant information was introduced into the systems by FECO, the domestic
implementing agencies (DIAs) and other sector ministries involved in the Project. The PMOs for each
sector plan were tasked with management of the MIS and the overall responsibility of ensuring that the
phase-out associated with each sector plan was consistent with the ODS phase-out framework contained
in China's CP.
Performance-based Implementation Modality. The performance-based structure of the Project ensured
that, de facto, an annual quality at entry process would be undertaken for each sector plan during both the
preparation of the annual audits, the Bank's independent verification reporting, and the preparation of the
annual plans (Aps) associated with each sector plan. This ensured an ongoing, transparent M&E process.
Annual Audits/Verification Procedures. In line with the efforts made to ensure that overall operating
procedures across the Project's various sector plans were inter-changeable, standard annual performance
audit requirements were built into each sector-specific agreement as per the terms of the umbrella GA.
China commissioned independent performance audits for each sector plan and independent financial
audits of the ODS phase-out account, which were carried out by the National Audit Office of the People's
Republic of China (CNAO). In addition, the Bank commissioned independent technical assessments and
verification audits, in accordance with the terms of each sector agreement negotiated with the ExCom.
From a supervisory perspective, the Bank also regularly conducted informal verification visits to various
enterprises across all sectors involved in the Project on the margins of supervision missions.
Mid-Term Review (MTR). There was no official MTR conducted for the Project. An 'unofficial' MTR,
given that it was prepared well-beyond the Project's mid-term, is dated March 2007. While the Project's
M&E structure demonstrated good coverage of the individual sector plans under implementation, they did
not speak to the bigger picture and thus, the unofficial MTR provided a comprehensive overview of the
ODS IV Project.
Project completion reports (PCRs). The ExCom requires that every MLF-funded project complete and
submit a PCR to the Senior Monitoring and Evaluation Officer of the MLF. With the advent of multi-
year, performance-based projects, a specific PCR template for such projects was designed to collect
information regarding, inter alia, the fate of ODS-based equipment, the types of equipment procured,
payments from grants, ODS and substitutes consumed, actual production after conversion, cost
effectiveness and ODS equipment disposal certification. Submissions prepared for the halon, MAC, CFC
production, PU foam, I & CR, PA I and PA II, TCA and APP sectors were consulted during preparation
of this ICR.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Safeguards
The Project was approved prior to the adoption of the Bank's current, comprehensive Safeguards Policies.
With the adoption of a Bank-wide policy on Safeguards, the Project was referred to as a category "C",
given that it components offered positive environmental impacts at both global and local levels as a result
of the elimination of ODS, but no specific safeguard actions were applied to the components under ODS
IV. Nevertheless, Bank environmental specialists formed part of the core supervision team. These team
12


﻿members monitored the Project's social and environmental aspects. For example, they ensured that, in
line with MP guidelines, only mature, proven and commercially available technologies could be used in
the transition away from the controlled ODS and, as is the practice for all MLF-funded projects, that all
discarded ODS equipment were destroyed and the processes certified. They also ensured that sector
relevant health and safety issues were addressed during the design and preparation of each sector plan.
Indeed, under the PA Sector plans, EIAs were required under national regulation: Bank environmental
specialists supported the PMO by reviewing and providing guidance in the design of effective EIAs.
In addition, once the Bank has instituted its Safeguard Policies, on a regular basis, and in tandem with
Bank supervision missions, Bank environmental specialists provided safeguard guidance to the sector
plan PMOs and DIAs. Given that manufacturing or production closures were envisaged across all sectors,
the Bank team worked with Government counterparts to address possible workers' layoff issues through
worker compensation schemes, based on Chinese regulations, or through re-employment opportunities
within converted enterprises. A case of displacement of workers did arise under the halon production
sector plan, though based on the terms of the Project affected workers were compensated for two years
lost wages.
Fiduciary Compliance
Given the performance-based nature of the grant, the procurement of goods and services was not tracked
for disbursement purposes and no procurement requirements were levied at the level of enterprise
activities. All DIA implementation services, technical assistance activities, and consultant contracts, were
subject to Bank prior review. Selection of consultants proceeded in accordance with the Bank's
'Guidelines on Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers', dating from 1997,
and contracts were subject to Bank post-review.
With the addition of two new clauses under Schedule 1, Part A as part of the 2005 GA amendment (see
Section 1.6), the GA was also amended at that time to include Schedule 2A governing the "Procurement
of Goods, Works and Consultants' Services and Purchase, lease or Construction of Office Building. All
for the Implementation of Parts A.2 and A.3 of the Project."
Post procurement and expenditure reviews were carried out on a regular by the Bank's procurement and
financial management (FM) specialists. Issues raised by the expenditure and post procurement reviews
prepared were clarified and efficiently resolved. Based on training provided by the Bank procurement FM
specialists, the Project PMO and the DIAs were in a position to maintain clear and detailed sector
accounts, as well as progress reports. Annual financial audits were provided to the Bank. No issues were
identified and the Project is considered to have complied with the Bank's policies and guidelines.
As with safeguards, the Bank's procurement and FM specialists also conducted a series of half day
or day-long training sessions for the PMO and DIAs in order to familiarize them with Bank best
practices and ensure that all relevant procedures were followed. 2.5 Post-completion
Operation/Next Phase
No additional phase is required to tackle the ODS addressed by the ODS IV Project subsequent to its
implementation and completion. All enterprise level ODS-using equipment was verified to have been
dismantled and rendered unusable. All the ODS targeted by the Project, at both the production and
consumption levels, were phased out and replaced by the use of other substances. China was able to meet,
and surpass, all the phase-out targets mandated by the Montreal Protocol. Compliance was maintained
throughout the Project's implementation.
13


﻿Work initiated under ODS IV Project did however, lay the groundwork for the Government of China to a
initiate a sustainable transition in addressing the next generation of post-2010 ODS through the
phase-out of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). Preparation for work in this new sector began within
the context of the ODS IV project, with the foam sector demonstration projects and preparatory work
associated with the important HCFC production sector. The demonstration of HCFC alternatives in the
foam sector, for example, built confidence in the technical feasibility and sustainability of alternatives to
the use of HCFC 141-b, which led to the preparation of a full scale HCFC foam sector strategy within the
context of China's HCFC Phase-out Management Plan whose first stage has been approved (US $73
million) and is now under implementation. Experience gained through the ODS IV Project's CFC
production phase-out effort also compelled the Government, with the Bank's support, to launch an
upstream effort in tackling HCFC production early on in order to balance global HCFC consumption and
production phase-out. The first stage of the HCFC production sector phase-out (US $95 million) has now
launched implementation. Clearly, experiences and lessons gained during the more than fifteen years of
implementation of the ODS IV Project served to inform the strategy adopted by China for this next phase
of ozone protection.
3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: High relevance
The Project's objectives, and its results, are of direct relevance to a number of current country-level and
global environmental priorities. The Bank's current Country Partnership Strategy (CPSFY13-16), aligned
with China's 12th Five-Year Plan and informed by the China 2030 study that was prepared jointly by the
Bank and the Development Research Center of the State Council, has as an objective provision of support
for greener growth. The Project has direct bearing on two aspects associated with greener growth:
demonstrating pollution management and strengthening mechanisms for managing climate change (see
section 3.5.c.). More specifically, Outcome 1.6 of the CPS, 'Demonstrating Pollution Management
Measures', calls for the Bank to remain a strong partner with China in achieving the accelerated phase-out
of the HCFC family of chemicals, given China's recognized position as the world's largest producer,
consumer, and exporter of chemicals associated with ODS.
The Project's outcomes were also of high relevance, unintended at the time of design, with respect to
ozone-climate co-benefits, generating important greenhouse gas emission reductions as an indirect benefit
of CFC phase-out (see section 3.5.c).
3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
The GEO was fully achieved. The assistance provided by the Project to China in phasing out its ODS
consumption (production, export, and import) allowed the country to fulfill its MP obligations. This was
particularly important from a global perspective as well, as China represents one of the largest remaining
ODS producers and consumers at the time of the Project's launch. Through a combination of financial
assistance to enterprises, regulatory measures and technical assistance, the Project supported China's
development of a robust and comprehensive ODS phase-out program.
Reduction of ODS. The Project successfully assisted the Government of China in phasing out its
consumption of ODS in a timely and cost-effective manner, as mandated under the Montreal Protocol and
14


﻿in line with the objectives outlined in China's Country Program. Each of the ODS sector plans
implemented resulted in the conversion away from ODS to alternative substances, verified by well-
structured monitoring systems under each sector plan, and the dismantling of old ODS-using equipment
was verified and certified. Indeed, with the assistance of the Project, China succeeded in accelerating
phase-out of CFCs and halons earlier than the targets required by the Protocol. The full scope of the
reductions achieved as a result of the Project's implementation of China's production sector phase-out of
CFCs, halons, CTC and TCA had significant impact at the global level, particularly the production sector
closure of CFCs, which contributed directly to global compliance with the Protocol. Tables 3.a and 3.b
below highlight the impact of the Project's contribution to the sustainable, accelerated phase-out of
China's ODS consumption and production trends.

﻿Institutional strengthening. The institutional strengthening component effectively provided technical
assistance to strengthen the management and operational capabilities of SEPA (MEP), other relevant
government agencies and the Project's sectoral implementing agencies. Over the course of the Project's
implementation, SEPA built up a strong management team of 40 professionals to support sector plan
development and implementation. All staff received training on project management, procurement and
disbursement, as well as on the mechanisms of the Protocol (e.g., its policies, financing guidelines, MP
sector plan preparation, approval process, and verification and reporting requirements).
The institutional management structure of the Ozone Unit housed within SEPA successfully implemented
the ODS IV Project. Beginning with the halon production sector plan, SEPA formed sector management
teams for each ODS sector plan approved, bringing together representatives from other government
ministries, technical experts and local implementing agencies. This ensured that knowledgeable parties,
both policy-wise and technically-speaking, were involved from the outset in the design and
implementation of each sector plan. Furthermore, SEPA's drive to leverage the Project's innovative
management structure to support establishment of the China Convention Compliance Center (CCCC) as
the node for consolidated ODS policy and technical management in China, ensured that a comprehensive
and strategic approach would guide ODS management in China into the future. Indeed, the management
capacity developed during implementation of the ODS IV Project was recognized to be robust and
therefore, was applied more broadly by FECO to the implementation of other MLF-funded activities
executed under the guidance of UNDP and UNIDO. This allowed FECO to fully streamline its ODS
program, even to this day with the implementation of China's HCFC phase-out program.
Extensive, sector relevant legislation and regulatory controls were enacted by the Government in a timely
fashion. Over the Project's lifespan, more than 100 policies and regulations were issued at the national
and sectoral levels governing ODS production and consumption, import/export and product quality. Of
note were the quota licensing system and the ban on new construction, modification or expansion of
production lines. Importantly, China's Air Pollution Prevention and Control Law was amended in 2000 to
include the objectives of the Project's ODS phase-out activities. This law was further supported through
the development of a Regulation on ODS Management by the State Council.
A factor that was considered crucial to the sustainability of the phase-out process involved the
development of ODS technically and financially viable alternatives and substitutes. Extensive, productive
collaboration was initiated with national universities and technical institutes through investment in
research and development. These partnerships continue to this day. The applied R&D work conducted led
to the development of standards in the CFC, foam, halon, MAC, process agent and CTC sectors.
The Government's Ozone team developed a solid national management structure that includes tiered
allocation of responsibility at the provincial, municipal and enterprise levels. The Project strengthened
the role of ODS producers' within China's ODS compliance regime by instituting a process of self-
monitoring and reporting amongst producers in the various sectors as a bottom-up means of controlling
and enforcing production quotas issued annually. It also initiated a devolution of ODS phase-out
responsibility from the State level to the provincial and municipal levels. Initial efforts amongst twelve
provinces and cities were both well-received and contributed significantly to the sustained ODS phase-out
across China, leading the Government to encourage the transfer of these experiences more broadly.
3.3 Efficiency
The rating for efficiency is deemed to be highly satisfactory.
Consistent with the project approval regime exercised by the ExCom of the MLF, efficiency is assessed
based on the cost-effectiveness (CE) of phase-out achieved. CE is defined as the amount of MLF grant
17


﻿per unit weight of ODS phased-out in ODP kg. The average cost of ODP phase-out achieved across all
sectors of the Project was $1.93/kg ODP, while unit costs ranged from $1.00/kg to $12.37/kg, depending
on the sector. The unit costs achieved compare very favorably with those of the previous China ODS III
project. For example, the average cost across the entire Project was 39% the average cost of ODS III at
$5.01. Similarly, the unit phase-out cost of CFC phase-out in the foam sector in ODS IV was $4.46/kg
ODP, which compared favorably to China ODS III and India at $4.84/kg and 7.64/kg, respectively. The
average cost of ODP phase-out achieved across all sectors under ODS IV also compared favorably to
other ODS projects within the Bank's East Asia and the Pacific portfolio namely, Malaysia (US
$10.19/kg ODP), Indonesia (US $4.41/kg ODP) and the Philippines (US $4.28/kg ODP). Furthermore,
the cost effectiveness of the Project's various components compared to CE thresholds applied by the MLF
for the various sectors were similarly favourable, as outlined in Table 3 below:

* No thresholds were established for the CFC production sector. The cost of US$ 4.02/MT is
based on the average of approved funding for the total CFC production phase-out.
** For halon, TCA and CTC, the CE is converted into CE/ODS MT instead of per ODP ton.
As a result of the flexible nature of the Project's operating structure, adaptive management was used as
required to respond to - and adjust component activities to - changing circumstances (i.e. decision to
abandon the industrial restructuring approach initiated under the I&CR component). In addition, CE
thresholds of the various substances targeted under the Project fluctuated as the availability of alternatives
grew. Factors such as these resulted in the Project achieving savings for client. These savings (the balance
between the amount disbursed by the Bank of $424.4 million and actual disbursement by FECO to
enterprises and other eligible activities) were, and continue to be, reinvested into the Government's
ongoing ODS phase-out program, as defined within its CP, thereby reinforcing the sustainability of
phase-out contributed by the Project. Additional details are provided in Annex 3.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
The relevance of the Project's objectives, design, implementation and efficiency is rated Highly
Satisfactory. All the Project's GEO and Intermediate Outcome targets were met at the 100% level. The
project objective was fully achieved, with this high level of efficacy demonstrated by the following
18


﻿*  The Project helped ensure China's compliance with the Montreal Protocol's ODS compliance regime.
Through the implementation of nine sector plans China's production of halon, CFCs, CTC and TCA
was completely phased-out, in some sectors in an accelerated manner [with the exception of
stockpiles or exempted uses (see Annex 2)], as was its consumption of ODS in the MAC, PU foam,
process agent and I&CR sectors, as evidenced by the country's data reporting under Article 7 of the
Montreal Protocol;
*   Effective programmatic integration was achieved by building upon results, lessons learned and
innovations achieved during implementation of the previous ODS projects (ODS I, II & III);
*  National level management of China's ODS Program was effectively strengthened. Indeed, the
consolidation of the sector plans under one umbrella grant lay the foundation for the development of
the national phase-out management plan modality under the MLF, which was widely adopted by the
MLF and all other Implementing Agencies, and forms the basis upon which the MLF is now
supporting the phase-down of consumption and production of HCFCs in Article 5 Parties.
*   Cost-effective use was made of the MLF grant funds, as evidenced by the savings achieved which
were then reinvested into China's ongoing ODS management program; and
*  Acceleration of phase-out in the production sector, particularly with respect to CFCs, contributed
directly to allowing other Article 5 ODS-consuming countries to transition to alternatives, thereby
ensuring achievement of global compliance with the Protocol in 2010 by 197 Parties.
In sum, given the high relevance, high efficacy and high efficiency demonstrated, the Project outcome
rating is considered Highly Satisfactory.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The implementation of the ODS IV Project contributed to greener growth reform objectives outlined in
the CPS. Actions in support of ODS phase-out encouraged the adoption of modem alternatives to ODS
and less energy intensive processes, both of which support reversing unsustainable environmental trends,
both domestically and globally. As pointed out in the CPS, an important aspect associated with green
growth involves removing future threats to growth in the form of pollution constraints and increasing
efficiency. The ODS IV Project emphasized helping stakeholders identify and address environmental
considerations in their operations and primary supply chains. The results were both ozone and climate
positive (see section 3.5.c., below).
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
See Section 3.2.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
The phase-out of ODS achieved under the Project contributed significant additional indirect global
environmental benefits through the reduction of global warming potential (GWP). The C02 equivalent
(CO2e) impact of phase-out achieved through the production sector plans alone is calculated to be 443
million tons. In 2008, the ODS IV Project was awarded a Green Award from the World Bank's
Sustainable Development Network, in recognition of the C02 impact of the ODS IV Project's production
sector work.
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

﻿Not applicable.
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low
The risk to development outcomes is rated as low.
*   With the acceleration of production sector phase-out of CFCs, halons, CTC and TCA, the global
markets for these substances were eliminated.
*   Extensive, sector relevant legislation and regulatory controls were enacted by the Government in a
timely fashion.
*   Each of the ODS sector plans implemented resulted in the conversion away from ODS to alternative
substances, verified by well-structured monitoring systems under each sector plan, and the
dismantling of old ODS-using equipment was verified and certified.
*   The Government's Ozone team developed a solid national management structure that includes tiered
allocation of responsibility at the provincial, municipal and enterprise levels.
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
The Project's aims and structure were a direct and appropriate response to China's standing as the largest
ODS producer and consumer and to the changing nature of global ODS phase-out challenges. The Project
was clearly designed according to China's longer-term, sustainable compliance objectives under the
Protocol, as well as to respond to China's interest in efficiently and cost-effectively addressing its
compliance requirements under the MP. The design of each sector program was strongly influenced by
the Government's concern regarding China's compliance standing with the Protocol, while the umbrella
implementation modality provided the flexibility required to operationalize the management of sector-
level phase-out.
The adoption of a multi-year, performance-based sector implementation modality encouraged enhanced
national execution and capacity-building. As noted in the 2000 QAG review, the Project's structural
design allowed the specificities of phase-out work in each sector to be negotiated between the
Government, relevant authorities and producers/enterprises directly within integrated, annual programs,
thereby attributing responsibility for compliance across all relevant parties. From project identification
through appraisal, for each sector plan developed, the Bank maintained a strong team with relevant
experience on ODS technology, Montreal Protocol and MLF policy and guidelines, Bank operations and
financial management that consistently worked in close cooperation with all national stakeholders. The
step-wise nature of the development of sector plans under the Project ensured ongoing quality at entry by
the Bank team virtually throughout the duration of the Project.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
For the duration of the Project's implementation, the Bank team provided SEPA and all other Project
counterparts across all sectors with consistent, timely and the best available ODS policy and technical
20


﻿advice through regular supervision missions, as well as site-specific technical visits, as evidenced in the
aide memoires prepared. The Bank team also ensured that guidance on financial management,
procurement and environmental and social safeguard issues were effectively addressed under each sector
plan. Specific FM and procurement training was provided by Bank specialists for FECO, the PMO sector
staff and DIA staff in order to ensure that fiduciary and procurement requirements were clearly
understood and respected.
The complex nature and structure of the Project called for intensive supervision, which was made possible
given the adequate financing providing by the management fee approved by the ExCom for each sector
plan approved. Over the fifteen years of Project implementation, World Bank supervision missions were
undertaken on average three times a year, and were carried out in conjunction with supervision for the
ODS III project, which had begun earlier but was being implemented in parallel. This encouraged
integration of results and exchange of learning as missions would systematically review status, progress
and challenges being experienced in each sector. Site visits, which provided first-hand understanding of
on-ground implementation experiences and provided the opportunity to update partners and stakeholders
on MP policies and guidelines, were conducted as required and reported upon as an annex(es) to the
Project's Aide Memoires. The 'learning by doing' approach to supervision also allowed the Bank team to
work effectively with the PMO to address implementation hurdles as they were encountered. Delays, for
example, in the Process Agent and Pharmaceutical non-MDI components, driven by different factors,
were managed such that implementation did pick-up and most importantly, sector plan objectives and MP
compliance targets were met (see Annex 2, Sections A.2.6, A.2.9 and A.2.10). Project supervision was
further strengthened by the fact that, for the bulk of its duration, a core Bank team, including technical
specialists, was maintained. This helped build trust and facilitated the cementing of the relationship with
the client.
The Bank Team also assumed an important role as interlocutor on behalf of the Government and the
various sector stakeholders with the MLF ExCom. As per the operating guidelines of the Bank's Ozone
Trust Fund, once the umbrella grant was approved, the Bank team negotiated approval of all subsequent
sector plan projects directly with the ExCom. The team participated and oversaw the preparation of each
sector plan, providing advice with regard to the selection of conversion technologies, policy options and
incremental cost calculations. It then submitted and successfully negotiated each sector plan submission
with the ExCom, and negotiated fair sector plan agreements and disbursement tranche schedules. The
team also reviewed and provided guidance for the development of each AP under each sector plan, which
ensured regular and monitoring of performance and achievements. The Bank team also monitored
compliance with the Bank's fiduciary and safeguard policies, reviewed procurement and disbursement
procedures and audit reports. Mission aide memoires and ISRs were regularly completed, providing a
consistently satisfactory view of the implementation status of the Project's various sector plans.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
Given the quality of Bank performance at entry and during supervision, the overall performance rating for
the Bank is Highly Satisfactory. In line with OPCS ICR guidelines, this rating is considered applicable to
the overall Bank performance in the development and implementation of the ODS IV Project as no
shortcomings were discerned in the evaluation of the Bank's role in supporting the operation's
achievement of its objectives (phase-out and compliance with MP targets), in its efficiency (effectively
managing nearly a dozen important sectors in a performance-based manner within an umbrella structure
in a cost effective manner), or in its relevance (promoting achievement of China's CP and CPS objectives
with emphasis on supporting an innovative national execution modality).

﻿5.2 Borrower
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
Government performance, rated across the spectrum of the Project's full implementation is considered to
have been Highly Satisfactory. The Government was, and remains, a strong advocate for action in support
of the Montreal Protocol, as demonstrated by the fact that compliance with the ODS phase-out control
measures of the Protocol was maintained. Another indicator is that Project results served to inform
China's 12th Five Year Plan on Air Pollution Prevention and Control in Key Regions7 , as well as the
design of the country's current HCFC Phase-out Management Plan (HPMP) Foam Sector Phase-out Plan
and its HCFC Production Sector Phase-out Plan. Agencies involved, from the NLG to the provincial and
municipal levels through close interaction with MEP, all played a role, to varying degrees, in ensuring the
development and adoption of comprehensive policy frameworks and the transition to viable alternative
technologies, in advancing a diverse national capacity base to address the issue into the future, and in
promoting awareness about the importance of ODS management and protection of the ozone layer. The
Project benefited from sustained political will and commitment, which can be extremely challenging over
a period as long as the 16 years duration of the Project.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
The technical complexity of the Project was reflected in the complex management structure adopted to
oversee the various aspects of its implementation. The FECO Ozone team was composed of 40
professional and support staff that worked in concert on all the programming captured within ODS IV,
both approved and under preparation. This team was, from the outset, well acquainted with Bank
operations and procedures, given previous experience managing Bank-implemented Montreal Protocol
MLF-funded projects and new team members benefited from training. The PMO has shown strong
commitment and ownership of the project on behalf of the Government.
For the first decade of the Project's implementation, the Government was supported in the daily
supervision of enterprise-level activities by a series of domestic implementing agencies (DIAs) that were
selected through competitive bidding by MEP/FECO. These included the China Foam Association, the
China National Chemical Construction Corporation (CNCCC), the China Plastic Association and later,
the National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products (NICPBP). The DIA
were tasked with supervision of enterprise-level activities, reviewed disbursement requests from
beneficiaries and prepared disbursement requests to the PMO for authorization, reported to the PMO on
status of enterprise project implementation and, identified and alerted the PMO to any issues identified
during supervision at enterprise-level. These contracts were largely successful, though in 2007, ,given the
"Twelfth Five Year Plan on Air Pollution Prevention and Control in Key Regions". Section5.4.3: Elimination of Ozone-Depleting
Substances. " Refine the approval and supervision system for ODS's production, utilization, imports and exports. Fulfill the obligations
of the Montreal Protocol target requirement to eliminate HCFC and CFCs in medical aerosol and bromomethane, and restrict the growth
in production capacity of HCFC and methane chloride. Enhance the development and application of substitutes and substitute technology
in relevant sectors, and strengthen contractual capacity construction in national, local and sectorial levels." [Clean Air Alliance of China.
Link: "China Clean Air Policy Briefings No. 1". April 2013.
22


﻿specialized nature of the ODS program and the limited number of contractual parties that were considered
qualified to lend support, the Bank team recommended that the FECO/PMO take over the full
management of daily operations. This move coincided with the development of the CCCC and the
consolidation of ODS management activities.
The devolution of ODS phase-out management to provincial EPBs and municipal level representatives
was also a positive factor in the Project's implementation, as it lay the foundation for further future such
shared management in future, and the terms for a more truly national form of execution.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
The project was completed in a highly satisfactory manner as a result of the leadership demonstrated by
MEP, the constructive collaboration initiated with the State ministries of the NLG and other levels of
government, industry associations and enterprises. All partners contributed significant human capital (see
Annex 7).
6. Lessons Learned
ODS production issues should be tackled in a more upstream manner within the context of ODS phase-
out strategies. Experience gained in particular through the ODS IV Project's CFC production phase-out
effort compelled not only the Government, with the Bank's support, but also the MLF ExCom to invest in
an upstream effort to curb HCFC production early on in the accelerated phase-out timeline in order to
balance global efforts to phase-out HCFC consumption with elimination of production capacity.
Addressing the phase-out of ODS at the sector level is a more rational and cost-effective manner by
which to curb large, non-uniform and dispersed consumption and production of ODS. The use of a three-
pronged phase-out approach that supports policy development, technical assistance activities and the
financing of ODS phase-out on at enterprise level based on annual sector reduction targets addresses the
key aspects of sustainable management of complex sectoral or national initiatives. Such an approach
necessities strong, integrated management, where all parties involved clearly understand and respect their
roles and responsibilities, as witnessed by the results achieved by FECO. Furthermore, the use of the
sector plan approach allows for national ODS production and consumption levels, by sector, established
under each ODS component to be more easily verified by the Bank during supervision.
The modular nature of the umbrella modality stipulated within the Project's Grant Agreement (GA) was
key in supporting the aforementioned point, though it was strongly reinforced by the addition of a
standardized sectoral phase-out approach (noted in the point above). The flexibility provided by the
umbrella structure of the GA could be equitably applied across components given the fact that all sectors
targeted policy, TA and investment work. This allowed for flexibility of management, decision-making,
inclusion of additional sectors and allocation of funds within a stable component by component
framework.
Performance-based programming, where funds are released annually based on pre-determined phase-out
schedules, targets, and specific performance indicators having been met, provides an excellent
implementation structure with which to motivate and incentivize stakeholders to find the most cost-
effective ways to convert to non-ODS technologies or to phase-out ODS production. Housed within a
consolidated sectoral or national framework, such programming lends itself to effective planning and can
be very effective in generating higher-level, sustainable results.
23


﻿The Project's issuance of sub-project contracts under each component (sector) was managed by the client
wherein rather than the Bank reimbursing actual expenditures, 'ODS phase-out contracts' were initiated
and disbursements were issued based on performance (the achievement of verifiable milestones). This
allowed the Project to generate savings. Although the generation of savings is not considered to have had
a negative impact on either the Project's performance or the efficiency it demonstrated, given the global
objective behind MLF grant financing, it is better practice to use the Bank's Designated Account
mechanism as a means of disbursing funds. In this manner, savings accrued, as may be the case, can flow
back to the Bank from the client and in turn, be returned to the MLF for investment in other ODS
reduction projects.
Investment in the development and effective management of a comprehensive MIS, complemented by
verification of both financial records (conducted by the national audit body) and technical results by
World Bank experts, are key to gauging the accuracy of results generated. The MIS tool allowed FECO to
establish a tool with which to accurately report national, aggregate data, as required under Article 7 of the
Protocol, as well as at the sector-specific data. Such tools have continuity and are excellent value for
money. The experience of the MIS gained under ODS IV continues to contribute to China's ODS Phase-
out Program, as it is now being applied to the new ODS V Project initiated to address China's HCFC
consumption and production. On a related note, while the Project demonstrated the value of financial and
technical verification, the initial approach adopted, in which the audit and verification were conducted
separately, proved time-consuming and not particularly efficient in terms of building a fully
comprehensive overview of the sector's progress. As a result, the audit and verification systems were
harmonized in 2008 and, this lesson has been transferred through the harmonized audit/verification
approach instituted under the new ODS V Project.
7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
Since acceding to the Protocol in 1991, China has gradually developed comprehensive policies,
regulations and a management system for the protection of the ozone layer. It has constantly strengthened
compliance through capacity building in various sectors and levels of Government, and has developed an
effective management mechanism. By 2010, China has successfully phased out a total of more than
100,000 tons of ODS production and 110,000 tons of ODS consumption. Among the achieved phaseout,
the ODS IV project implemented by the World Bank contributed a majority portion to the success.
The implementing work done by the Bank has displayed its professional performance in terms of project
development and design, sector plan preparation, supervision and monitoring, technical assistance,
coordination and communication with international stakeholders, sound and transparent management, as
well as innovative measures in the carrying on projects. The Bank helped the Chinese government
improve the capacity of project management and increase the R&D ability of the industries, which not
only secured the China's compliance of the Montreal Protocol but also brought social and economic
benefits to the society.

﻿Annex 2       Outputs by Component
Introduction
The Project was consistent with the strategic priorities outlined by the Chinese Country Program for the
implementation of the Montreal Protocol and the financial mechanism of the MP, which provided funding
assistance, on the basis of incremental costs to Parties to the Protocol operating under Article 5 of the MP,
(i.e. definition).
It was realized on ODS III project that the phase-out of ODS consumption by financing the phase-out on a
company-by-company phase-out would be too time consuming and costly. It was also recognized that
supply of ODS (i.e. production) had to be aligned with the consumption in order to ensure sustainable
phase-out. In order to avoid unfair competition, it was also recognized that the phase-out had to be
addressed on an ODS sector level and not on a company level. Finally, the company-by company
conversion approach would also not ensure that China would be able to meet the ODS consumption and
production limits set by Montreal Protocol.
In order to overcome the problems and short-coming of the company-by-company ODS phase-out, the
China in cooperation with the Bank suggested an "ODS Sector phase-out approach".
The "sector approach" would be to financing ODS phase-out based on a programme to completely phase-
out all ODS consumption in a given sector (e.g., aerosol or halon) and the associated ODS production.
A sector approach would include an ODS phase-out schedule, supporting policies and other measures to
achieve phase-out. The total funding level to be covered by the Multilateral Fund for the entire sector
phase-out programme would be agreed up-front by the Executive Committee. These agreed costs should
represent efficiency, as compared to the company-by company (project-by-project) approach, in the use
of Multilateral Fund resources based on $/kg of ODP which would be phased out.
Funding tranches would be approved each year by the Executive Committee based on the agreed phase-
out schedule, satisfactory progress reports, and actual ODS phase-out. National level phase-out would be
independently verified. As long as the ODS phase-out schedule is met year-by-year, new funding tranches
would continue to be approved in amounts which had been agreed up-front by the Executive Committee.
The use of a sector approach to ODS phase-out was presented to the ExCom of the MLF and endorsed.
The sector plan approach eventually became the modality of the fund for the Chinese ODS program.
A2.1 Halon Sector
The Halon Sector Plan targeted China's production and consumption of halons used in portable fire
extinguishers and fixed installed fire extinguishing systems. The Halon Sector Plan agreement negotiated
with the MLF ExCom stipulated that production and consumption for ODS uses of halon 1211 would be
phased out by December 31, 2005 and for halon 1301 by December 31, 2009. Funding tranches would be
released annually based on independent verification by the Bank that the target for the performance target
for the previous year, as outlined in that year's AP, had been met. (in the Chinese agreement with
ExCom).
A total of twelve APs were prepared for the sector between 1998 and 2009. The Halon Sector Plan
successfully met the terms of its agreement by effectively supporting the Government in maintaining
27


﻿compliance with its obligations under the Protocol. By December 31, 2005 and 2009, production and
controlled consumption of halon 1211 and halon 1301 respectively, had been verified as phased out, as
indicated in Tables Table 2.2-1 below

The production lines at fourteen (14) producers of halon 1211 were closed down and dismantled, and
financial. Technical and financial support was provided to build capacity and smooth technology
transition for the production launch of alternatives including, ABC powder, foam and C02 cylinders. In
addition, one (1) producer of halon 1301 ceased production for ODS uses, though production continued
for non-ODS uses. This ongoing production of halon 1301 for non-ODS use arose in 2005 when a foreign
company launched production of a pesticide (Friponil) in China that uses 1301 as feedstock.The use of
halon 1301 as feedstock is not controlled under the Protocol and hence, the producer was entitled to
continue production of halon 1301 for feedstock uses only. Follow up, monitoring and verification
conducted confirmed that all halon 1301 produced was used as feedstock only.
Of the seventy-six (76) registered manufacturers of halon 1211 used for fire extinguisher products and the
twenty-two (22) registered manufacturers of halon fire extinguishing systems identified at the time of
design, sixty-one (61) and sixteen (16), respectively, received financial support for the conversion to the
using alternative fire extinguishing agents including, ABC powder, foam and CO2 cylinders. The
remainder were found to have either ceased their business or had converted to alternatives without
financial support from the project.
At least thirty-five (35) new fire safety standards were developed during implementation of the Project,
which facilitated the introduction of alternatives for both halon 1211 and halon 1301. Forty (40) training
courses, seminars and workshop were carried out, including training for the staff from the more than
1,000 service centers across China who perform service and maintenance of fire extinguishers, and over
twenty (20) technical assistance (TA) activities covering studies, national verification of contracts and the
development of national and provincial halon management programs were implemented.
The principal tool used in implementing the halon phase-out was a production quota system which was
developed and introduced through a decree issued by FECO. The quota system assigned a production
28


﻿quota to each producer based on their 1996 level of halon production. In order to avoid non-compliance
with the consumption level, the quota system was designed such that producers only received production
quotas equal to the allowed national consumption, though they could apply for additional halon
production quotas based on documented export of halons.
In order to meet the annual reduction targets outlined in the sector plan agreement, FECO bought back
production quotas so that the remaining aggregate annual quotas would remain within the allowed
production level. The buyback quota system was conducted through an annual tendering process wherein
holders of halon production quotas were invited to submit bids indicating a requested price per tons of
halons in exchange for the sale of their quota to FECO. The quota reduction could be for either the
following year, for a partial quota sale, or for a permanent sale of their entire production quota. Selection
of the latter resulted in dismantlement of the halon production facility in accordance with the
requirements stipulated by the Protocol and the Bank, and required necessitated verification by FECO and
the Bank. If producers were NOT willing to sell back sufficient quotas to meet their annual targets, FECO
was entitled to reduce production quotas on a prorated basis in order to meet annual targets. Producers in
turn, were compensated at a predetermined rate per ton for their respective production quota reduction.
During the first years of the quota system's use, a good number of companies were willing to participate
in the bidding however, as the sector plan project evolved, remaining producers were less willing to sell
back their production quota due to the fact that as the supply of halons was declining, the price for the
quotas offered by FECO could not compete with the profit that could be made by continuing production.
This compelled FECO in the ensuing years to first negotiate with producers then prorate the quota
reductions amount amongst them. Another unforeseen issue that arose was that with the closure of halon
1211 production and the availability of alternatives in the market, the demand for this ODS diminished
rapidly. Nevertheless, halon 1211 production continued in accordance with the quotas received which
generated a surplus of halons well beyond the annual demand for halon 1211 that remains stockpiled. In
turn, halon recycling programs established failed due to the restrictions imposed on use of halons and the
stockpiles that remained held by producers.
Consumption of halon 1211 and halon 1301 by fire extinguisher manufacturers was addressed in the same
manner as for producers. In order to ensure consistency with production reductions, fire extinguisher
manufacturers were invited to participate in annual bidding during which enterprises that offered the most
competitive conversion cost per kg of halons were offered ODS reduction contracts. Such ODS reduction
contracts covered either conversion, with the funding per kg calculation dependent on the substitutes
selected, or closure.
The phase-out of halons and introduction of substitutes was possible given that proven substitute
technologies were commercially available on a global scale, and the transfer of the technology was
therefore, not considered a barrier. In accordance with the MLF Policies and Guidelines, compensatory
funding was provided up front to halon producers to cover their expected loss of revenues and profits.
Development of halon substitutes was viewed as an integral Project activity. However, once Project
implementation began, it became clear that the timely development of substitutes was not keeping pace
with the phase-out schedule. FECO decided therefore, given the flexibility accorded to it under the terms
of the sectoral performance-based agreement modality, and with MLF and Bank approval, to establish a
"Special Initiatives" procedure to finance the production of substitute fire extinguishing agents including,
ABC powder and foam, as well as light-weight cylinders for CO2 fire extinguishers.

﻿A2.2 Mobile Air-conditioning (MAC) Sector
CFC-12 was the refrigerant used in mobile air conditioners (MAC) in new vehicles in developed
countries until around 1995 and in developing countries until 2000. A MAC system consists of
components such as compressors, evaporators, condensers, valves and hoses. The MAC components are
manufactured by companies based on specifications provided by vehicle manufacturers and delivered as
components to the vehicle manufacturers. The MAC components are installed at the assembly lines
during the production of vehicles. The MAC systems are charged with compressor oil and refrigerants at
the vehicle assembly lines. Most vehicles manufactured in China are equipped with pre-installed MAC
systems.
Given the rapid growth of vehicles produced in China, and the associated growth in CFC-12 consumption
in the MAC sector, as well as the expected life of vehicles and MAC systems in vehicles of at least 10
years, and an expected annual service demand of 0.25 kg to 0.4 kg per MAC system, an early phase-out
of the use of CFC in the manufacturing of new MAC systems was necessary, especially taking into
account the phase-out target of January 1, 2010 for CFC production.
Phase-out of CFC-12 in the MAC sector was initiated under the ODS III project in 1995 and continued
under the MAC Sector Plan approved under the ODS IV project. The MAC Sector Plan was approved by
the ExCom in November 1998 with funding of US$ 7.7 million (plus a 3% management fee). The Sector
Plan consisted of: policy support; investment in conversion of MAC component manufacturers to HFC-
134a and updating of the national testing laboratories; as well as TA activities, including the updating of
existing MAC standards and the development of new ones.
While only conversion of MAC component manufacturers was approved for financing under the sector
plan, a complete change over to HFC-134a MAC system in all new vehicles manufactured in China after
2005 was nevertheless required in order to meet consumption phase-out obligations. The conversion to
HFC-134a at vehicle manufacturers was therefore, used as a performance indicator for the sector plan. An
audit of all vehicle manufacturers (23 manufacturers) was carried out, which confirmed that China had
complied with the conditions as agreed with the ExCom.
The following were the main activities carried out under the sector plan:
a.  Completion of the conversion of the MAC sector from CFC-12 to HFC-134a systems by
January 1, 2002.
b. Mandatory standard inspection of new vehicles and not allowing any registration of new
vehicles with CFC based MAC systems after January 1, 2002.
c.  Financing the conversion of compressors, heat exchangers and other MAC components at 11
companies.
d. Upgrading of the national MAC testing system enabling it to test HFC-134a MAC components
and MAC systems.
e.  Developing standards for HFC-134a MAC components and systems and other TA activities.
f.  Supporting training of MAC component manufacturers, MAC service sector and other
stakeholders.
g. Audit confirming that all vehicle manufacturers had converted to HFC-134a for all new
vehicles produced.

﻿A2.3 CFC Production Sector
Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are used as propellants in aerosol cans, refrigerants in household
refrigerators, commercial refrigerating equipment, mobile air conditioners, blowing agents for the
production of polyurethane and polyethylene foams, and as solvents. Chinese production of CFCs began
in the late 1970s and increased in line with the rapid growth in their use in China grew resulting from
economic development and improved living standards.
The CFC Production Sector Plan was developed in 1997. At the time, production was housed in 52
production facilities located in 37 enterprises. Geographic distribution was broad. The CFCs produced
were CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113, CFC-114 and CFC-1158 and CFC-139. The Sector Plan targeted
reduction of CFC production in an annual, step-wise manner, with a complete production phase-out by
January 1, 2010. To support the effort, a three-pronged approach was instituted: (i) adoption of policies
and regulations; (ii) implementation of investment activities; and (iii) implementation of TA activities. As
with the halon sector plan, submission and ExCom approval of the APs and annual verification of
compliance with the performance targets were requisite factors governing the release of funds in annual
tranches.
The CFC Production Sector Plan was successful in phasing-out CFC production and supporting the
Government in maintaining compliance with its obligations under the Protocol. Indeed, China was able to
accelerate its CFC production sector phase-out by two and a half years. By July 1, 2007, controlled
production had ceased. Allowed and actual CFC production is shown in table 2.2.1 below.

A number of important policies were introduced to support the phase-out of the CFC production. For one,
a ban on the construction of new CFC production facilities or on the expansion of existing CFC
production facilities was instituted. The Government then also introduced a CFC production tradable
quota system, as was done under the halon sector plan, under which existing eligible CFC production

Defined by the Protocol as Group 1, Annex B, substances.

﻿facilities were assigned an initial quota equal to their 1997 production. The regulation adopted allowed
producers to engage in quota trading, which could be either permanent for the duration of the Sector
Plan's implementation, or through an annual quota. If the former was selected, the enterprise's entire
production quota was sold and its CFC production facility was dismantled.
The CFC production sector plan also introduced a buyback system of CFC producers' production quotas
to meet annual reduction targets. Through a bidding process, FECO would buy back quotas at the lowest
price possible until the annual reduction target had been met. If insufficient bids were made by the
producers, FECO proportionally reduced quotas to meet the annual target and compensated the CFC
producers based on the maximum price for the quota year. Restriction of CFC exports and imports, based
on licenses issued by the Export-Import Office, supported the system and, as of 2006, the CFC export
licensing system was further strengthened by allowing only CFC producers to export.
The annual buy back of production quotas from producers formed the core of the investment activities
initiated under the CFC production sector plan. Until 2004, demand from CFC producers to sell back their
production quotas and cease CFC production was strong. After that, only 6 producers remained and none
expressed an interest in participating in the program, as structured. As a result, CFC production quotas for
each of the 6 remaining CFC producers were reduced proportionally through the quota buy back policy in
order to allow China to achieve its annual CFC production reduction targets.
In addition to the quota reduction system, the sector agreement with the ExCom allowed China to use
funding for the production of substitutes, as was done under the halon sector plan. China elected to
support the construction of a HFC- 134a, a non-ODS fluorinated gas selected globally as the substitute for
CFC-12 in mobile air conditioning systems, production facility in order to ensure that sufficient effective
substitutes for CFC-12 were available.
A total of 43 TA activities were initiated in support of the CFC Production Sector Plan's implementation.
This included strengthening institutional capacity, establishing standards, assessing substitute
technologies, and conducting studies related to ODS consumption sectors affected by the CFC production
phase-out. A special study was also carried out to assess potential risks to China's industrial
competitiveness resulting from its MP program. Another important TA initiative involved the
establishment of a Management Information System (MIS), under which CFC producers were required to
report quarterly to FECO on their monthly production, use of feedstock, sales, stockpile, etc. The MIS
was also used to keep track of all contracts signed and the status of implementation of the sector plan's
investment and TA activities.
The additional support provided by the APP approval in 2004 (see section A.2.5., below) allowed China
to accelerate its CFC production phase-out commitment by two and half years, to July 1, 2007, at which
time five of the six remaining CFC production facilities were shut down and dismantled. The additional
ODP impact of this accelerated phase-out was 11,700 ODP Tons. The plan for early closure of CFC
production focused attention on the need for stockpiles of CFCs to meet future servicing sector demand in
the refrigeration and air-conditioning sector, as well as for pharmaceutical products. Prior to shutdown
therefore, FECO initiated contracts with four of the CFC producers to establish storage facilities and
produce a stockpile of 3,500 MT of CFCs for future use. In addition, one CFC- 11/12 production line at
the Juhua Fluoro-chemical Co., Ltd. 10, remained open post-January 1, 2008, for CFC production up to a
maximum of 550 ODP T under the 2008 and 2009 APs for the specific in the APP for the use of the CFCs
in the production of metered dose inhalers (MDIs) used by asthma or chronic pulmonary disorder patients.

﻿This limited production was verified annually and found to be consistent with the APP agreement (see
section A.2.8).
A2.4 The PU Foam Sector
CFC-1 1 was used as blowing agent in the polyurethane (PU) foam sector to produce foam used as
building insulation, insulation in domestic and commercial refrigeration appliances, pipe insulation,
integral skin foam etc. Surveys conducted during the design phase of the PU foam sector plan found that
the PU foam sector consisted of more than 2,000 companies, the bulk of whom used less than less than 10
MT/yr, of CFC- 11 with between only 200 to 300 companies using a greater amount. Earlier project-by-
project phase-out in the sector had underscored the point that such an approach was not efficient in terms
of consistent and cost-effective phase-out, particularly given the sector's characteristics.
The PU foam sector plan approved committed China to limit the annual consumption of CFC-1 1 in the
PU foam sector within the limits spelled out in the agreement for the CFC production sector plan. The
CFC production quota system and import/export quota system were the main tools used to control
consumption of CFC- 11 in PU foam sector.
The industrial restructuring or foam company consolidation scheme was adopted under which groups of
small foam producers eligible for financing were consolidated with larger (lead) enterprises. These, in
turn, received new, more energy efficient, less polluting ODS-free equipment that produced improved
foam quality which would help maintain market share. The foam productions in the participating
companies were shut down and workers received compensation and training in accordance with Chinese
Labor laws and provincial regulations. Through the promotion of mergers, plant closures and other forms
of industrial re-structuring, it was expected that only the most competitive enterprises would remain in
business, making the PU foam sector leaner and healthier. Through the industrial restructuring approach
14 group companies with 106 participating smaller foam companies were financed.
Implementation of the industrial restructuring plan however, experienced delays given that verification of
CFC consumption at participating companies turned out to be complicated and challenging enterprise. As
a result, the average implementation of group sub project took between 24 and 36 month [in some outlier
cases up to 60 months In addition, the stiff competition in the sector and financial constraints pushed
some of the lead enterprises to withdraw from the plan.
In response, SEPA, in consultation with the China Foam Association, and the Bank elected to discontinue
the use of the group sub-project approach in 2006. It was also decided that only CFC consumption by
foam enterprises had to be confirmed by invoices acceptable to CNAO. Finally, it was also decided to
fund enterprises on an individual basis. As it was impossible for FECO to reach smaller CFC consuming
enterprises effectively and in a timely manner, a provincial approach was used where local consultants
hired by the provinces identified and provided technical support for enterprises conversion to HCFC-14 1b.
This approach, supported by the APP, helped bring implementation back on track. It should be noted that
the initial delay experienced in conversion in the sector did not impact the overall national phase-out of
CFC- 11 as supply of CFCs was controlled by the CFC production quota system, which ensured
compliance with sector agreements and MP obligations. The delay did however, put pressure on the foam
companies to speed up their conversion to alternatives.
As in the other sectors, new policies banning establishment of new foam producers using CFCs were
developed and enacted by SEPA. New foam standards were enacted and existing standards updated.
Annual training activities and workshops were organized for foam company employees, provincial EPBs
and other stakeholders. Annual audits and verification of ongoing and completed sub-projects at the PU
foam company level were conducted.
33


﻿The sector plan's phase-out schedule was adjusted based on the acceleration of the phase-out of CFC
production addressed by the APP. Because of the APP, the implementation of the PU foam sector was
accelerated with an additional aggregate consumption reduction of more than 9,000 ODP Tons compared
to the original CFC- 11 consumption in the agreement for the PU foam sector. The use of CFCs in the
foam sector was banned on January 1, 2008.

A2.5 Industrial and Commercial Refrigeration (I&CR) Sector
The I&CR sector included more than 1,000 small and large companies that manufactured various types of
industrial and commercial refrigeration equipment and components for refrigeration systems.
When the original CP was developed in 1995 it was agreed between China and ExCom that China would
request funding only for conversion of the manufacturing of compressors for industrial and commercial
refrigeration equipment, as compressors are the key component of refrigeration systems. As per the
original CP, 24 compressor production lines in 21 companies were to be converted and 49 production
lines in 46 companies would be closed down. The phasing out of CFC in these companies began under
the ODS III project and was completed under the ODS IV Project.
The ODS IV I&CR sector plan was approved by the ExCom in March 2002 with funding of $5.25 million.
The sector plan, as approved, aimed to address conversion at each of the 5 remaining industrial and
commercial refrigeration companies, which included: 1) Zhejiang Chunlian Refrigeration Machinery Co.
Ltd; 2) Shanghai Minhang Refrigerator Factory; 3) Zhejiang Beifeng Refrigeration Machinery Co. Ltd; 4)
Zhejiang Yuhuan Refrigeration Machinery Co. Ltd; and 5) Dalian No. 2 Refrigerating Machinery Factory.
As part of the agreement with the ExCom, China was provided with the flexibility, where necessary, to
adjust its implementation approach, and to utilize the funds approved as necessary within the sector in
order to achieve sustainable and cost-effective phase-out of CFC.
34


﻿The first four enterprises were relatively small and located near each other in the eastern part of Zhejiang
Province. To simplify project implementation and increase efficiency, this Project component supported
the consolidation of these four enterprises into one technically and financially more robust enterprise, the
Zhejiang Chunhui (Group) Co. Ltd., as opposed to initiating conversion at each enterprise as has
originally been the design. As a result, the I&CR sector plan's focus was tighened to two enterprise
conversions as opposed to five: the group conversion projects implemented by Zhejiang Chunhui (Group)
Co. Ltd; and, the individual conversion project implemented by Dalian No. 2 Refrigeration Machinery
Factory. Upon completion of implementation, this Project component resulted in the permanent reduction
of consumption of 750 ODP tons of CFC.
The main activities carried out under the sector plan included:
a. Transfer of technology for the manufacturing of HCFC-22 compressors.
b. Consolidation and conversion of compressor manufacturing lines at 5 companies financed by
the Project.
c. Conversion to a significant technical upgrade resulting from the replacement of existing
production equipment with fully automatic digital machining centers and Computer Numeric
Control (CNC) machines for the various compressor components.
d. Existing dedicated measuring tools were replaced by automatic coordinate measuring
equipment to ensure that the components met the more stringent tolerance standards as
required for the alternatives refrigerants as compared to CFC.
e. New tools for the machining centers and lathes were provided as part of the conversion
package; existing testing equipment at the companies was upgraded to meet the higher
pressure requirements.
f. Upgrading of the national testing center for compressors and industrial and commercial
refrigeration equipment was completed.
g. Policies supporting CFC phase-out were introduced including, banning production of CFC
based compressors and the import of CFC based refrigeration equipment after January 1,
2005.
h. Technical assistance activities, including technology transfer, workshops and training were
completed.
i. Verification of completion of all conversion activities in the I&CR sector was undertaken.

A2.6 Process Agent and CTC Production Sector Plan I (PA I)
Carbon tetrachloride, (CTC, CCl4), is an ODS chemical with an ODP of 1.1. Its main uses were as
feedstock for the production of CFCs, as process agent for the production of various pharmaceuticals and
pesticides and as a solvent for e.g. metal cleaning. China originally had a number of smaller production
facilities dedicated to CTC production only. Starting beginning of 1997-200 CTC production change to
CM plants where CTC is co-produced on ChlorMethane (CM) production facilities together with
production of methyl chloride (CH3C1), methylene chloride (CH2Cl2) and chloroform (CHCl3). The
amount of CTC produced is in the order of 3~7% of the total CM production and could be adjusted based
on demands for the four chemicals. As the CTC is an unavoidable production, the phase-out of the CTC
35


﻿production can only be achieved if the CTC is either used as feedstock or destroyed through a technology
recognized by the Parties to the MP. (feedstock, -mean use as raw material for the production of other
chemicals).
Process application are defined as a process where the ODS chemical are used as a solvent during the
production of a final product, e.g. a pharmaceutical, pesticide etc. The process agent is not participating in
the chemical process and remains unchanged after its use as a process agent. Some of the process agent is
normally lost during the process due to leakage, discharged with waste water, evaporation losses and
some might be contained in the final product. The rest of the process agent is recovered and reused. The
consumption in the PA sector is defined as the annual amount of process agent used for topping up at a
PA facility.
While the amount of CTC lost can be minimized through improvements of the production facilities, the
preferred approach to the phase-out of ODS process agents normally mean conversion to the use of other
process agent chemicals. Use of other process agents will normally require replacement of the production
facilities or significant modification. Use of alternative process agents might also impact of the quality of
the product for which the process agent is used.
Process agent has been a complicated issue under the MP. As per decisions of the MP, only ODS
consumption associated with process agent applications listed by the MP are controlled by the MP and
ODS production and consumption must be phase-out in accordance with the MP requirements. When the
Parties to the MP adopted Decision X/14 with a list of 25 approved applications only 5 process agent
applications by 26 companies were found in China and the CTC and CFC-1 13 production and
consumption had to be phased out accordingly. The applications was Chlorinated Rubber (CR; 7
companies); Chlorinated paraffin (CP-70; 12 production lines at 10 companies); Chlorosulphonated
Polyolefin (CSM; (3 companies); Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE; 5 companies); Ketotifen (1 company).
The PA 1 Sector Plan was approved at the 38th ExCom meeting in 2002 with a total funding of USD 65
million. As per the agreement, a number of production lines using ODS as process agent would be closed
down and other converted to alternatives. Emission control was agreed for one company for the
production of CSM. In order to align CTC production with the consumption, CTC production was include
in PAI sector plan and limits on control of CTC for ODS uses were agreed. The PAl Sector Plan would
reduce production and consumption of CFC-113 by 17.2 ODP tons and CTC by 3,020 MT by December
2009, allowing a production and consumption of 200 MT of CTC for CSM production using emission
control. The agreed limits for CTC production and consumption for the PA 1 applications are shown in
table 1 below.
The following are a brief review of the implementation of the PA I sector plan:
-  CTC production was controlled within the limits given by the agreement. Dedicated CTC
production facilities were closed down and dismantled.
-  Of 19 producers of CTC, 10 dedicated production facilities were closed down and dismantled. At
the end of the Sector Plan, China had a total of 12 companies with CM production facilities.
-  One producer with a CM production facility developed a technology allowing converting CTC to
MCI and reuse it for production of e.g. chloroform. The technology is now used by all CM
producers in China.
-  Of the 26 companies with 28 production lines, 9 production lines were converted to alternative
technologies and 19 production lines were shut down.
-  For companies who closed production, labor was either assigned to other work within the
company or laid off and fully compensated in accordance with local regulations and received
training for other job.

﻿One of the main tools for the implementing of the CTC consumption phase-out was the development of a
CTC sales quota system. Under the CTC sales quota system, legal users of CTC have to apply for a quota
through from FECO through an on-line application and reporting system. Quotas are issued to eligible
users and based on previous year CTC quota adjusted to ensure that the overall consumption would be
within the allowed consumption for the year. CTC producers and dealers are only allowed to sell CTC to
users with a CTC quota. All procurements by quota holders and sales by CTC producers and dealers are
reported to FECO through the on-line system.
Aside from the CTC sales quota system, the main new policy introduced was requiring any new CM
production facilities to establish a CTC conversion system so that CTC could be use it as raw material for
the production of e.g. chloroform.
A total 35 Technical assistance activities were financed under the PA I Sector Plan. While Training and
workshops for the stakeholders were conducted on an annual basis.
Annual verification of CTC production and use of CTC by PA I companies were carried out on an annual
basis. In addition, financial audits of disbursement and confirmation that funding was used by companies
in accordance with the contracts were carried out. CFC- 113 production was verified through the CFC
sector Plan.

Implementation of the sector plan started in early 2003 in order to reduce the consumption of
CTC for the applications covered by the PA I sector plan from 5,049 ODP tons in 2002 to 220
ODP tons by 1 January 2010. To ensure full compliance with the target, the 2010 verification of
CTC consumption of the PA I sector plan was carried out in 2011. The verification of 2010 CTC
production and consumption conducted in 2011 confirmed the full compliance and the achievement of the
overall objective of the PA I sector plan. The final disbursement was made in 2012.
A2.7 Trichloroethane (TCA) Production Sector
1,1,1-Trichloroethane (TCA), also known as methyl chloroform, was used as a solvent and in many
consumer products. In China, it was used principally as a solvent. The TCA production sector plan was
approved as part of the ODS IV Project in 2004. At the time of the sector plan's approval, TCA
production had been stable for several years due to the low price of imported TCA, as well as to the drop
in consumption resulting from phase-out of TCA consumption that was being addressed by a solvent
sector plan under implementation with another implementing agency of the MLF.
There were four TCA manufacturers, all of whose TCA production lines were small capacity and ran on
batch operations. At the time of the sector plan's design, only 50% of the production capacity was active,
as two of the producers had ceased operations. The Sector plan involved a mix of actions: complete
dismantling of the two idle TCA production facilities, closure and dismantling of one producer, and
reduction of TCA production at the fourth facility. Facilities were remunerated for dismantling costs and,
in the two facilities where production continued, the sector plan covered production loss compensation.
The production sector plan was aligned with the country's agreement governing the consumption phase-
out of ODS solvents, which targeted 100% phase-out by January 1, 2010, five years earlier than mandated
under the Protocol.
In tandem with the consumption-focused solvents sector plan, implementation of the sector plan
supported the development of four licensing systems to control the production, trade, and consumption of
TCA in China. These included production quota, import quota, sales registration and consumption quota
licenses. Production quotas, whose regulation was formulated based on China's Air Pollution Prevention
and Control Law, were issued by SEPA based on the sector plan's phase-out targets and issued only for a
given year each January. Producer output could not exceed the quota and, in contrast with the halon and
CFC sectors, TCA production quotas could not be transferred. Excess production in a given year was
subject to a fine and deduction of that amount in excess against the next year's quota. A data registration,
reporting and monitoring system, including a MIS, tracked implementation of all activities: TCA
producers reported their production to relevant management agencies, namely local environmental
protection bureaus (EPBs) and industry association, who in turn conducted regular inspections, as well as
38


﻿surprise spot checks, of TCA producers. A ban on production and consumption of TCA was also issued,
which forbids, post- 2010, any production of TCA except for essential applications agreed by the Parties.
The TCA production sector plan was also successful in achieving its goals, accelerating the sustainable
phase-out of TCA production five years before the Protocol's mandated deadline, such that only
production for essential uses, as defined and approved by the Parties, continued. Table A.2.7, below,
shows allowed and actual verified production of TCA.

A2.8 Accelerated Production Phase-out (APP)
Funded by the USEPA under the MLF's bilateral funding mechanism window", the APP was initiated to
incentivize the acceleration of production sector phase-out further in order to help sustain the
achievements that had been realized with respect to the global phase-out of ODS. The APP effectively
served as a tool to move the production sector phase-out components of the Project beyond the sector
approach to a more coordinated, systemic, national-level phase-out. In so doing, it also supported the
establishment of the China Convention Compliance Center (CCCC) as the node for consolidated ODS
policy and technical management in China. The APP's impact was supranational, as the acceleration of
production phase-out, particularly with respect to CFCs, had a significant impact in leading to the 100%
compliance status that the Protocol was able to achieve in 2010.
The APP broadened the scope of the Project by expanding phase-out activities at the level of provinces
and municipalities, which apart from facilitating operational aspects of the Project, such as monitoring of
activities and public awareness and outreach at the local level, encouraged earlier phase-out of CFCs at
the national level. FECO initiated acceleration of CFCs and halon production phase-out at the municipal
level in collaboration with the city of Shenzhen, which proposed to go beyond even the APP schedule by
phasing out the substances one year earlier than specified. This compelled three provinces (Jilin,
Shandong and Hainan), two municipalities (Beijing and Tianjin), and eight cities (Wuhan, Xi'an,
Shenzhen, Suzhou, Taizhou, Nantong, Changzhou and Langfang) to also voluntarily accelerate CFC and
halon phase-out. These partners: promulgated bans on ODS production, trade, and consumption, with the
exception of servicing and essential uses; established and effectively implemented standardized
stakeholder monitoring and supervision systems; enforced regulations and punished incidences of illegal
11
Allowed donor countries to withhold up to 10% of their agreed contributions to the MLF with which to implement discreet bilateral
projects. Such projects remained subject to review by the MLF Secretariat and approval by the ExCom.
39


﻿ODS production, trade, and consumption activities; prohibited the use of ODS products/equipment and
products/equipment containing ODS in new construction projects; banned products containing ODS and
products produced with ODS in government procurement processes; established a system of registration
for existing in-use ODS equipment and their servicing needs through the licensing system for CFC
procurement and use of CFC recycled equipment; adopted policies favorable to ODS substitute
production enterprises within their jurisdiction; and, encouraged public involvement by establishing hot
lines for reporting of illegal activities.
Ultimately, the APP propelled the phase-out of production of CFCs to advance by two and a half years, to
July 1, 2007, with the exception of a 550 T production MDIs for medical uses. The accelerated reduction
of CFC production also affected the production of CTC for feedstock use for CFCs, and accelerated the
annual consumption reduction of CFC- 11 used as a blowing agent captured in the PU Foam Sector plan,
speeding phase-out in the foam sector by one year to complete phase-out on January 1, 2008. In the halon
sector, the APP reduced the production of halon 1301 by an additional 10,000 ODP T as compared to the
phase-out schedule agreed upon in the sector plan's ExCom agreement and limited the net amount of the
ODS allowable for export to 200 ODP T from January 2006 onwards.
A.2.9 Process Agent Sector Plan II (PA II)
The Sector Plan was added to the Project in 2006 with an objective to reduce CTC consumption in
additional process agent applications (in addition to those covered by PA I) from 6,945 ODP tons in 2006
to 994 ODP tons by 1 January 2010. In addition, China was also obliged by the agreement with the
Executive Committee that funding from this project should also be used to finance other applications that
may be classified by the Parties to the Montreal Protocol as process agents in the future. During the
implementation of this Sector Plan additional activities were reconfirmed by the Parties as new process
agent applications. Therefore, a longer implementation timeframe was required to address these
additional applications. The final disbursement from the Bank to China was made in 2012.
Decision XV/6 of the Parties added another 13 PA applications12 to the list of Process Agents for which
CTC production and consumption had to be phased out. The PA II Sector Plan was approved, in
principle, as a continuation of the PA I and CTC Production Sector Plan, with requirements for additional
reduction in production and consumption of CTC. As per the agreement between the Government and the
ExCom, production lines using ODS as PA would be closed down or converted to alternatives. Due to
lack of alternative technologies for applications using chlorinated polypropylene (CPP) and chlorinated
ethylene-vinyl acetate (CEVA), reduction in residual emission controls were agreed upon.
The PA II Sector Plan reduced production and consumption of CTC by 6,945 MT by December 31, 2009,
while allowing for ongoing production and consumption of 994.3 MT of CTC in the production CPP and
CEVA using emission controls. The agreed limits for CTC production and consumption for the PA II
applications are outlined in Table A.2.9. 1, below.
12 The new PA applications included Cyclodime (9 companies), Chlorinated Polypropene (CPP; 16 companies), Chlorinated
Ethylene-Vinyl Acetate (CEVA; 3 companies), MIC derivatives (6 companies), MPB (3 companies), Mefenacet (3 companies)
Imidacloprid (4 companies), Buprofenzin (3 companies), Oxadiazon (3 companies) and Chlordized N-Methylaniline (CNMA; 1
company).

Given that it was considered likely that more process agent applications would be added to the Protocol's
list with time, China also agreed that the funding received for the PA II component would be used for
such additional applications, and that the country would not apply for additional funding for such new
applications in future.
The information below provides an overview of the activities carried out and the results achieved by the
PA II component.
a)     Production of CTC was reduced by 6.945 MT through the use of CTC conversion technology that
had been developed.
b)     Forty-five (45) production lines at 40 companies using CTC as process agent were closed down
or converted to alternative technologies, including CPP and CEVA production lines, which
reduced CTC consumption by 6,945 MT.
c)     The allowed consumption of 994.3 MT of CTC beyond 2009 was ultimately not required as the
producers of CPP and CEVA were able to identify a viable alternative and elected to convert their
production lines as opposed to instituting the emission control option.
d)     New process applications added to the list of process agent applications by the Parties were
financed under the Sector Plan.
e)     Workers at production lines that elected to close down were either assigned to other work within
those enterprises or, if laid off, were compensated in accordance with local labour regulations.
f)     Over 20 TA projects, training activities and workshops were financed under this component, in
order to reinforce the long-term sustainability of the investments made.
g)     A study on the issue of residual CTC and how companies were handling the issue was carried out.
The outcome of the study led to widespread adoption of the instruction that residual CTC was to
be incinerated or used as feedstock.
h)     An automatic CTC production monitoring system was set up by installing flow meters at each
CTC producer. The system included automatic transfer of CTC production data and data on CTC
use as feedstock to FECO within the context of the Project's broader M&E strategy and reporting
requirements under Article 7 of the Protocol.

﻿A2.10 Pharmaceutical Non-MDI Aerosol Sector
CFC-1 1 and CFC12 were used as propellant in some medical aerosol products. With the phase-out of
CFCs, alternative propellants had to be identified and subsequently replaced CFCs. Due to specific and
stringent health requirements of medical products, especially those for internal use (e.g. Meter Dosed
Inhalers (MDIs), and other similar drugs), finding alternatives to pharmaceutical products was a major
challenge globally. Not only the performance requirements of the final products but also ensuring
compatibility between alternative propellants and the medicine were a major challenge. Moreover, due to
major public safety concerns, approval procedures of new non-CFC based pharmaceutical products are
complex and time consuming.
Production of medicinal aerosols in China included skin aerosols, cavity and mucosa absorbed medicinal
aerosols, and respiratory tract absorbed aerosols (MDIs). The use of ODS in the latter was exempted
provided such use was reviewed and approved by the Parties of the Montreal Protocol. However, the use
of CFCs in skin aerosols, cavity and mucosa absorbed medicinal aerosols, was referred to as non-MDIs,
were subject to phase-out by 2010. The non-MDI pharmaceutical aerosol sector plan was prepared in
2007 to assist local pharmaceutical non-MDI sector plan to phase out the use of CFCs on a timely manner
without compromising safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical non-MDI products.
The Sector Plan for the non-MDI pharmaceutical products was developed and approved by ExCom in
2007 with a funding of USD 6 million (plus 3% support cost). Activities carried out under the Sector
Plan included preparation of relevant domestic CFC phase-out policies, information dissemination on the
phase-out obligations and schedules as well as alternative technologies adopted in developed countries,
and technology transfer. When implementation of the Sector Plan was completed, a permanent and
sustainable reduction of CFC consumption of 485.1 MT/year was achieved. As the process of
identification of the new alternative technology to the government's approval of the new formulation
(without CFCs) was long and tedious, the Sector Plan included a strategy to preempt any disruption in the
supply of these products during the conversion process to non-CFC technology by allowing the use of
CFCs stockpiled before 2009 for manufacturing non-MDI pharmaceutical products beyond 2009. The
key performance indicator as per the agreement between the ExCom and China was the ban of CFC use in
non-MDI pharmaceutical aerosol products by July 2013. The ban was actually issued in July 2013
The State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) assumed responsibility for the management and
supervision of CFC phase-out activities carried out by individual enterprises. The National Institute for
the Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products (NICPBP) was selected as a Designated
Implementing Agency (DIA) for this sector plan.
The main activities under the Sector Plan were:
*   Identification of non-CFC alternative propellants, test and certify of alternatives for 25
pharmaceutical skin products and 24 non-MDI pharmaceutical products. After production
development and internal test were completed by the enterprise, a formal approval by the Chinese
State Food and Drug Administration was required.
*   Conversion and certification of aerosol filling lines at 26 companies.
*   Development of standards for alternative propellants for pharmaceutical products. Standards were
developed for Isobutane, HFC-227ea, HFC-134a. Chinese standards for the propellant were a
prerequisite for approval of any products with alternative propellants.
*   Training workshops for both SFDA officials in all provinces and municipalities in China.
Workshops for the pharmaceutical companies in China were also a key activity under the project.
These workshops not only inform stakeholders of the CFC phase-out schedule in the sector but
42


﻿also inform about the potential alternatives and the required approval process for new
pharmaceutical products.
* A CFC procurement system was set up to ensure that only eligible pharmaceutical companies
could buy CFCs from the existing stocks of CFCs.
Implementation of the Pharmaceutical non-aerosol sector plan was carried out beyond the original closing
date of June 2011. This delay was inevitable due to a few external factors. Due to health safety concerns,
it is commonly known in the pharmaceutical industry that an average of 5 - 10 years development
timeline is required before a new product can be released to the market due to the stringent safety
requirements of the Public Health Department. However, due to protracted negotiations at the Executive
Committee level of the Multilateral Fund on the funding eligibility of the pharmaceutical sector, this
Sector Plan was only approved in 2007, two years before complete phase-out of CFC consumption was
called for. China and the Bank Team designed an implementation approach ensuring China's compliance
with the Protocol and minimizing disruption of the supply of these pharmaceutical products. In
coordination with CFC production sector, sufficient stocks of CFCs were allocated for the pharmaceutical
non-MDI aerosol sector, which allowed companies to continue meeting the market demand for their
products beyond 2010 while they were developing new formulations and undergoing the Government's
approval processes.
A2.11 Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) PU Foam Sector Demonstration Projects
When the decision of the Parties to the MP to accelerate the phase-out HCFCs was made in 2007, China,
which is the largest producer and consumer of HCFCs, was faced with a significant challenge, especially
when the CFC phase-out activities in the ODSIV project were still ongoing. In order to develop
knowledge and capacity for the HCFC phase-out, China requested as a first step funding for three PU
foam demonstration projects in order to test three different alternative blowing agents: one for
hydrocarbon delivered in bulk to the foam companies; one for polyols pre-blended with hydrocarbon; and
another for testing the use of HFC-245fa as an alternative to HCFC-141b. These demonstration projects
were critical for China to gain technical experience required for development of a larger scale sector plan.
The three foam demonstration activities were approved by the ExCom in 2009 with a total funding of
US$ 2.197 million (plus 3% support cost). The objectives of these demonstration activities were to assess
efficacy and performance of the three alternative technologies as well as capital and production costs of
the respective alternative technologies.
Hydrocarbon delivered in bulk: The replacement of the blowing agent from HCFC-141b to hydrocarbon
at Jiangsu Huaiyin Huihuang Solar Co., Ltd for the production of insulation foam of water tanks
confirmed viability of the technology.  This demonstration activity included evaluation of the
performance of the foam produced with cyclopentane as a blowing agent. The demonstration project also
identified proper safety measures to be undertaken when handling a flammable blowing agent. The
demonstration project confirmed that using hydrocarbon as a blowing agent was technically and
financially feasible although capital investment of this new technology was higher than the existing
HCFC-141b technology. Higher costs were due mainly to the hydrocarbon storage facility and safety
equipment needed at the foam production lines. The actual cost of the conversion to hydrocarbon was
estimated to be around US$ 400,000 higher than a conversion to commercially available HFC alternatives.
Polyols pre-blended with hydrocarbon: The demonstration project involved 5 companies. A producer of
polyols (Guangdong Wanhua Rongwei Polyurethane Co., Ltd ), that would set up a facility for mixing
and supply polyol (one of the raw materials for making PU foam) pre-blended with hydrocarbon. Several
formulations of pre-blended polyols were developed by Guangdong Wanhua Rongwei Polyurethane in
order to meet the specification of the four downstream foam enterprises. The four downstream foam
companies converted their foam production equipment in order to test performance of their final products
made with different pre-blended polyols. The project was completed successfully and confirmed that
43


﻿production and supply of pre-blended polyols was feasible. In addition, the capital investment at the
downstream foam companies reduced by over US$ 300,000 as cyclopentane storage tanks and premixing
unit for cyclopentane and polyols were no longer required. However, the cost would still be around
US$ 100,000 higher than a conversion to HFC alternatives.
HFC-245fa used for spray foam: The demonstration project was carried out by Harbin Tianshuo Building
Materials Co., Ltd., which is a company specialized in building insulation and spray foam. The
conversion was successful and provided useful information on the cost of conversion to HFC-245fa
technology. It was also confirmed that the foam insulation property was better than foam blown with
HCFC-14 1b. While capital investment required for adopting HFC-245fa is lower than hydrocarbon based
technology, due to the high cost of HFC-245fa the production cost of insulation foam blown with HFC-
245fa was substantially higher than those blown with HCFC-141b or hydrocarbon. It was, therefore, not
feasible for any companies to adopt HFC-245fa technology. In addition, HFC-245fa is a chemical with
global warming potential higher than HCFC-141b, so it might not be feasible for this alternative to be a
long term solution for the phase-out of HCFC-141b.
The lessons learned from these demonstration projects were very important for identifying the range of
technologies that could be used as viable alternatives for the HCFC PU foam sector plan. Better
understanding of cost and product performance and safety requirements of these different alternatives was
a critical input to the formulation of supporting policies for the HCFC-141b phase-out in the PU foam
sector and for determining the cost of the phase-out.
A2.11 Preparation of HCFC-141b PU Foam Sector Plan
HCFC-141b has been the main substitute for the phase-out of CFC-1 1 in the PU foam sector. Due to its
residual ODP of 0.11, the Parties to the Montreal Protocol recommended that HCFC- 141 b be addressed
first in the overall HCFC Phase-out strategy. Accordingly, China requested the Bank to assist in the
development of a sector plan for HCFC phase-out in the PU foam sector.
A sector plan was developed by China with the support for the Bank and presented and approved by
ExCom in 2011. The sector plan will assist China in meeting its 2013 and 2015 HCFC consumption
reduction obligations under the MP and will result in a reduction of consumption of over 14,000 MT of
HCFC-141b. Based on the lessons from the demonstration projects and the ongoing ODSIV project, the
sector plan built on the ODSIV experiences and lessons learned.
The preparation of the sector plan was financed by ExCom. The main activities covered under the sector
plan preparation were:
*   Workshops and seminars to alert and inform the industry and other stakeholders about the
HCFC phase-out to be implemented over the coming years;
*   Identification of potential alternatives to HCFC-141b and their possible impact on the foam
quality, environmental impact, climate impact and cost;
*  A nation-wide survey was conducted to identify foam companies using HCFC-141b and system
houses providing raw materials to the foam companies. Detailed information was collected from
more than 200 foam companies of which over 50 of them were visited by the Chinese foam
team;
*   Development of a detailed HCFC-141b phase-out plan which delineates a detailed HCFC phase-
out schedule, technical assistance and training needs to support timely and sustainable HCFC
phase-out, supporting policies, detailed cost calculation of the sector plan, and recommendations
of practical and verifiable performance targets for the sector plan; and
44


﻿* Development of an environmental management framework and social impact framework for the
PU foam sector.
A2.12 Preparation of HCFC production sector
One of the lessons learned from the ODS IV project was the alignment of ODS consumption and
production phase-out. At present, China is the largest producer of HCFCs, producing over 80% of the
global production. HCFC production phase-out in China would not only be important to China but also
to the overall HCFC phase-out efforts worldwide. A HCFC production sector plan was developed to
provide a strategic direction for China to curb production of various HCFCs to within the limits stipulated
in the Montreal Protocol.
The Plan was submitted to the ExCom in December 2012 and was subsequently approved with a total
funding of US$ 385 million. To enable China to meet the first two production reduction targets in 2013
and 2015, US$ 95 million will be made available to China during the period 2013 to 2015.
Project preparation funds were provided by ExCom. The main activities included in the preparation of the
sector plan were:
*  Workshops and seminars informing the producers and other stakeholders about the HCFC phase-
out requirements and the HCFC phase-out plans under preparation;
*   Collecting information of all HCFC producers in China, including information on location, type
of HCFCs produced, and ownership structure of the companies, etc...;
*   On-site audit of the 2006 to 2009 production of HCFCs, production costs, sales amounts and
prices, downstream and in-house use of HCFCs, number workers employed and others;
*  Independent audit of 2010 production and cost data;
*  Development of a production sector specific EIA and social framework for the production sector;
*  Presentation of the draft HCFC production sector plan to the stakeholders and discussion of the
implications and implementation modality; and
*  Development of a quota system for HCFC production and identification of other potential
policies needed for the implementation.

﻿Annex 3       Economic and Financial Analysis
An economic analysis that captures the overall Project's impact on China's economy would need to
include, in addition to the production, foam, refrigeration and air-conditioning, aerosols, fire protection
and solvent sectors, other productive sectors, consumers, and the government. In the absence of direct
data on the impacts that ozone depletion and climate change have on the health of the Chinese population
and other socio-economic aspects of Chinese life, it is not possible to carry out a project-level quantitative
analysis of these aspects.
Nevertheless, global-level analyses conducted by UNEP ['The Montreal Protocol and the Green Economy'
(2012)] credits the MP with having created enabling conditions that stimulated a transition to a Green
Economy, resulting in improved human well-being and social equity, as well as reduced environmental
risks. Specifically, technological advances and design innovations promoted under the MP have reduced
costs, produced cleaner and more reliable products and created better working environments. The report
asserts that the transfer of knowledge and technology in support of ozone protection has helped many
developing countries better compete in international markets. From a social perspective, the transition to
non-ODS technologies, products and services has resulted, on balance, in a shift in jobs, supported by
higher levels of training, versus jobs lost. And, in terms of human health, the MP is estimated to have
generated significant benefits, namely reductions in cancers and cataracts, that have been valued at more
than 11 times the direct investment costs of phasing-out ODS. It is therefore, expected that the project
impacts will be positive and that the cumulative impacts of the reduced use of ozone layer depletion in
tandem with the increased use of chemicals with lower climate impact will be positive for both the
Chinese and global societies.
As this Project was designed to help China meet its mandatory international obligation to phase-out ODS,
no specific estimate was made of the Project's likely economic rate of return (ERR), net present value
(NPV) or financial rate of return (FRR). Rather, the project modality used a performance-based sector
funding scheme under which disbursement of funds was made against verifiable sustained reduction of
ODS phase-out targets in each sector.
The Project's underlying principle was to compensate firms for costs driven by an international agreement
that was "external" to their daily business operations. The Montreal Protocol requires enterprises to pay
for the estimated financial benefits of technology upgrading, as distinct from the external costs associated
with ODS phase-out. However, the project was never meant to generate a positive rate of return.
The average cost of ODP phase-out achieved across all sectors of the Project was $1.93/kg ODP. The unit
costs range from $1.00/kg in the process agent and CTC production sector (PA I), to $12.37 in the
pharmaceutical non-MDI aerosol sector. These unit costs compare very favorably with previous China
ODS III project. For example, the average cost across the entire project was 39% the average cost of ODS
III at $5.01. Similarly, the unit phase-out cost of CFC phase-out in the foam sector in ODS IV was
$4.46/kg ODP which compares favorably to China ODS III and India at $4.84/kg and 7.64/kg,
respectively. The average cost of ODP phase-out achieved across all sectors under ODS IV also compared
favorably to other ODS projects within the Bank's East Asia and the Pacific portfolio namely, Malaysia
(US $10.19/kg ODP), Indonesia (US $4.41/kg ODP) and the Philippines (US $4.28/kg ODP).
Furthermore, the cost effectiveness of the Project's various components compared to cost effectiveness
thresholds applied by the MLF for the various sectors were similarly favourable, as outlined in Table 3
below:

1. Description
1.1 Historical context
1.1.1  Political Context
China joined the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer in September 1989, and
ratified the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer and the London Amendment
in 1991. As a developing country with low per capita consumption of ODS, China is an Article 5
country classified by the Protocol and is eligible to receive grant funds from the MFEC for its ODS
phase-out activities.
In January 1993, the Chinese Government approved its Country Program for Phase-out of Ozone
Depleting Substances. This established the Government's commitment to a complete phase-out of
controlled ODS by 2010, provided sufficient funds to support eligible incremental costs were made
available by Multilateral Fund and the technologies needed for non-ODS substitutes were transferred.
China's overall phase-out strategy has been articulated in sector plans for each of the major ODS sectors
in 1995. The Country Program was updated further in 1997 which was approved in 1999.
1.1.2  Economic and Social Situation
China was, by far, the largest producer and user of ODS among developing countries, and
therefore in the world, following the phase-out of ODS in developed countries at the end of 1995.
In 1991, the ODS production in China was about 30,000 tons and consumption 48,000 tons. In
1996, the ODS production in China reached almost 85,500 tons, and ODS consumption nearly
91,300 tons. It was forecasted that in the scenario without the Montreal Protocol control, the
consumption of ODS would reach to 310,000 tons by 2010. Based on the controlled targets
regulated by the Montreal Protocol, China established its Country Program for ODS phase-out.
The incremental costs would involve US 1.43 billion dollars.
1.1.3  Major Issues
Besides the significant scale of ODS in both production and consumption sectors, all ODS sectors
have a number of important and common characteristics that influence the strategy and policies of ODS
phase-out and need to be solved:
*   Large Quantities. In 1996, the ODS production in China reached almost 85,500 tons, and ODS
consumption nearly 91,300 tons.
*   Rapid Growth. Over the past decade, China had experienced rapid growth of industries using
ODS, particularly aerosol, refrigeration and air conditioning, fire-fighting, electronics and foam.
*   Geographic Dispersion of Enterprises. The ODS sector encompassed some 10,000-15,000
enterprises that were scattered throughout the country, and was dominated by town and village
enterprises sponsored by local communities.
*   Profitability of ODS. Based on technology available to Chinese enterprises, ODS production
had been a profitable industry in the face of growing demand for consumer products using CFCs
53


﻿and halon.
*   Non-competitiveness of Alternatives. Some alternatives were controversial, such as high
flammability of hydrocarbons. Some alternatives were transitional substances, yet expensive to
acquire, such as HCFC-22 for the commercial refrigeration sector. Some alternatives resulted in
expensive capital and operating costs, such as HFC-134a and HFC-227. As of that time, these
substitutes were not yet well-established in China.
*   Weak Regulatory Framework. Development of appropriate policies has picked up in recent
years, but regulatory framework for ODS has yet to be strengthened.
*   Multinational Corporations. In spite of the enormous size of the Chinese market and its rapid
growth, only a very small number of joint ventures between Chinese enterprises and
multinational corporations had developed in ODS industries. Hence the ODS phaseout cannot
be prompted substantially by internal corporate policies of multinational firms, or by the fact
that developed countries had banned ODS imports.
2 Institutional Framework
The Institutional framework comprises four levels- (a) National leading Group for the Protection of
Ozone Layer with 18 ministries and commissions as members headed by Ministry of Environmental
Protection (National Environmental Protection Agency at that time); (2) Project Management Office
located in the MEP; (3) National Import and Export Office of ODS and other divisions; (4) Related
associations and enterprises.
2.1 Objectives
The objective of the ODS IV project would initiate a sectoral policy-based approach to
phase out ODS production and consumption in China to fulfill its Montreal Protocol obligations
in a timely and cost-effective manner. A phaseout program would be developed for each ODS
sector based on an overall sector strategy to include all actions required to meet a phase-out
objective within a given time frame.
2.2 Components and sub-components
The ODS IV project comprises following components as in Table 1. The first sector
approved was the halon sector, which was chosen due to halon's high ozone-depleting potential
(ODP). Rest ODS sectors were added when they had been prepared. Each sector proposal and
program was submitted to MLF for funding approval when they were ready. The basic
institutional, financial and monitoring framework and mechanisms being developed in the project
were designed for application to all sectors.

2.3 Organization and implementation across ministries and agencies involved in implementation
2.3.1  National
The highest decision making body concerning ozone issues is the National Leading Group (NLG) for the
Protection of the Ozone Layer, formed by a total of 18 ministries (17 later due to a cancellation of a
ministry) including Foreign Affairs and the General Administration of Customs (GAC), among others.
The Ministry of Environmental Protection is the leading authority of NLG. The MEP (former National
Environmental Protection Agency) is a member of the State Council which is formed by more than 20
member ministries. MEP is the national implementing agency with the overall responsibility for the
success of the project. NEPA established a PMO in 1993 to manage China's ODS operations, which
include ODS programs with all MLF international implementing agencies. The MEP also has 31
Environmental Protection Bureaus (EPBs), one for each province in the country and more than 3,000
local EPBs in each of the main municipalities.
The responsibility for implementation of Montreal Protocol related activities in the country is placed on
the Project Management Office for the Implementation of Multilateral Fund Projects (PMO), established
in 1993, which is part of the Foreign Economic Cooperation Office (FECO) within the Ministry of
Environmental Protection (MEP). It is supported by the Financial, Contract, Procurement and General
Services Divisions of FECO.
The National Management Office for ODS Import and Export (NMO) was established jointly by the
Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP), the Ministry of Commerce and the General Administration
of Customs (GAC). Its main functions are to manage the ODS Imports and Exports Licensing and Quota
System, to propose the policies and regulations concerning ODS trade and to train customs and other
government officers on ODS trade related issues.
Domestic Implementing Agents (DIA). MEP (NEPA) was assisted by experienced implementation
consultant firm(s), selected by MEP and endorsed by the Ministry of Finance (MOF), to supervise all
enterprise phaseout activities. For example, based on terms of reference and selection criteria agreed with
the Trustee, NEPA selected the China National Chemical Construction Corporation (CNCCC) as the DIA,
which conducted bidding for grant allocation, supervise implementation of enterprise-level activities in
the annual programs, among others.
The implementation process was also assisted by industry associations such as the National Plastic
Processing Industry Association (NPPI) for the foam industry, the Chinese Household Electric
Appliances Manufacturers Associations (CHEAA) for the domestic refrigeration manufacturing industry,
and the Association of Fluorine and Silicone Industry (CAFSI) for the HCFC production sector, who
were instrumental in the identification and contact with the enterprises. The PMO in turn, makes direct
contracts with the beneficiary companies and with the association that assists the implementation process.
55


﻿2.3.2  International
The World Bank was the implementing agency for the ODS IV project. The Bank helped China develop
ODS sector strategies and phase-out programs. The role of the international implementing agencies has
been of project designing, technical assistance, channeling of financial resources, monitoring and
verifying the progress, and other aspects needed during the implementation of the project.
2. Design, Implementation and Impact
2.1 Assessment of Design
The most distinguished characteristic of the ODS IV project is its sectoral policy-based approach with
greater flexibilities. Reviewing this approach, there are several elements worth emphasizing.
Firstly, the Country Programme formed a solid base for designing the sector approach to achieve the
objective. In January 1993, the Chinese Government approved its Country Program for Phase-out of
Ozone Depleting Substances. This established the Government's commitment to a complete phase-out of
controlled ODS by 2010, provided sufficient funds to support eligible incremental costs were made
available by MLF and the technologies needed for non-ODS substitutes were transferred.
Secondly, timely review was carried out by the Bank on the previous project-by-project approach, which
helped China catch the opportunity of efficiently expanding the ODS phase-out. Before the ODS IV, the
ODS projects were operated on an individual project basis. The Bank reviewed and analyzed the key
operational lessons learned from all Bank-supported ODS operations, which included: (a) Use of grants to
finance closure or conversion of ODS facilities does not encourage enterprises to seek the least-cost
solution; (b) Individual project financing understates the phase-out costs to the economy; (c) Financing
projects individually does not always achieve an overall ODS reduction, but sometimes results in a
production shift to other enterprises; and (d) Lack of transparency in subproject selection has resulted in
poor phase-out planning. Furthermore, lack of a comprehensive national phase-out strategy and strong
government commitment to phase-out at the sector level have often accentuated the above problems.
Thirdly, systematic parameters were designed in the project to achieve the total phase-out objective. It
helped to form a reliable operation system and allow sufficient flexibility regarding grant utilization and
management. The parameters include: (a) policy and incentive structure to drive ODS phase-out; (b)
adequate monitoring and enforcement mechanisms; (c) efficient delivery mechanisms for channeling
grant funds from MLF to China and to beneficiaries; (d) greater flexibility to China in grant utilization
and management; (e) lower total phase-out costs to China and to MLF; and (f) upfront funding agreement
in principle from MLF on total eligible incremental costs for specific ODS sectors.
Fourthly, the sector approach with flexibility made the overall design for all sectors feasible. At the time
of the project started, not all sectors were ready for funding application and operation. The proposed
project then innovatively established a frame with the basic institutional, financial and monitoring
framework and mechanisms being developed in the project designed for application to all sectors, while it
started with one sector- halon sector, due to halon's high ozone-depleting potential (ODP). Other ODS
sectors would be added when they have been prepared. Each sector proposal and program would be
submitted to MFEC for funding approval when they are prepared. The sector approach therefore avoided
to a great extent the shortcomings of the project-by-project approach.
2.2 Main results achieved for each development objective (Le., key performance indicators) and
component
56


﻿The ODS IV has achieved its objectives successfully with main results reflected in indicators including:
2.2.1  The targets of ODS phaseout in all sectors have been reached. There are more than 10 main
(sub)projects in the ODS IV project. The phaseout ODP tons of each project is as in Table 2. The
phaseout of ODS contributed greatly to the climate change mitigation simultaneously. The success of
ODS IV has made it possible that China realized its ODS phaseout target for phase I (by 2010) 2.5 years
ahead of schedule.

Plan
2.2.2  A series of Laws, regulations and policies were released which formed a solid back-up for the
implementation. The policies comprise: (1) general laws and regulations covering all ODS sectors,
including Air Pollution Prevention and Control Law of PRC (Articles related to the ozone layer
protection), Circular on the Ban on Newly Built Production Facilities that Produce and Use ODS, etc. (2)
Policies for specific sectors were released timely, which include policies for CFC, Halon, CTC, TCA and
Methyl Bromide Sector. (3) Circulars on import and export of ODS policies were issued which gradually
banned the ODS import such as CTC and CFC. Catalogues of controlled ODS in China's import & export
were regularly updated taking the form of circulars. (4) Consumption management policies were set up to
ban the controlled use of ODS across halon, MAC, ICR, aerosol, solvent, and tobacco sectors. (5) Policies
on substitute and substitute products; and (6) Policies for supervision and management.
2.2.3  Production lines were converted, or dismantled, which were monitored and verified on a regular
basis. A number of alternative R&D projects were implemented. Through investment projects, the project
has improved technological level and competitiveness.
2.2.4  Technical assistance projects implemented in terms of training to enterprises, local EPBs and
management staff and raising public awareness.
3. Critical analysis of actions taken by the world Bank government and technical assistance
3.1 Assessment of the World Bank performance during implementation
3.1.1  Key decisions that facilitated implementation
During the implementation of the ODS IV project, the World Bank worked actively in providing supports
and assistance to China, in terms of preparation of projects, application of funding, project monitoring and
supervision, establishment of policies and regulation, creation and innovation in implementation modality
57


﻿and coordination among phase-out activities among production, consumption and import & export as well.
In particular, the key decisions were made and relevant actions were undertaken jointly by the World
Bank and Foreign and Economic Cooperation Office (FECO)/Ministry of Environmental Protection
(MEP), so as to facilitating the project implementation:
ODS Alternative Research and Development: Development of ODS alternative and
substitutes was a crucial factor for phase-out activities in production and consumption sectors.
During the implementation of the sector plan for CFC phase-out in production and sector plan
for phase-out of Halon in China, The Bank gave its high attention and provided its valuable
assistances in accelerating the R&D of ODS alternatives and technologies in China. Since 1999,
a number of technical assistance activities were jointly developed by the Bank and FECO/MEP,
mainly including: Study on Strategy of ODS Development I and II, workshops and exhibitions
on alternatives and substitutes were organized. To ensure a stable and sufficient supply of high
performance and affordable and economical substitutes in China after CFCs and Halon phased
out, taking consideration of the flexibility offered by the MLF fund to the Chinese government
and after several rounds of discussion and consultation with the Secretariat and stakeholders in
industry, the Bank and FECO jointly decided to fund constructing of HFC-134a production line
(Phase I and II), ABC dry powder production line, the light C02 fire extinguisher cylinder
production line through special initiative programme since 2001. It not only met the phase-out
demand in production and consumption sector, but also greatly improved the research and
production capacities of the Chinese chemical industry.
APP sector plan: Along with the smooth implementation of Sector plan for phase-out of
CFC/CTC/Halon in production, after coordination and consultation with corresponding
consumption sectors, the Bank and the Chinese government jointly decided to accelerate the
phase-out of CFC, CTC and Halon 1301. At its 44th meeting in November 2004, the Executive
Committee of the Multilateral Fund approved the United States and China bilateral project for
accelerating the phase-out of CFC and halon production and consumption. With the assistance
and supervision of the World Bank, China has successfully implemented the APP. By 2007, an
extra of 12,000 ODP tons of CFCs, 18,000 ODP tons of CTC and 10,000 ODP tons of Halons
had been phased out, in addition to the original plan, achieving the convention compliance goal
two and a half years ahead of the set date.
Capacity Building on ODS management: As the ODS phase-out activities carried out
gradually, a number of policies for ban on production and consumption of CFCs, Halon, CTC
and TCA were issued. Regulation on the Management of ODS came into effect since June 1,
2010. Policy and regulation enforcement remains the key issue for China to ensure the
sustainable ODS phase-out. Local environmental protection bureaus and custom offices were
playing a more and more active and important role in the course. Under this circumstance, the
World Bank worked together with FECO/MEP and developed a capacity building project on
ODS management, in order to improve the local government's supervision on ODS phase-out
activities to ensure country compliance of MP. Through implementation of the project, the
compliance capacities from central to local governments have been improved greatly.
Simplification of the procurement procedure: According to the complexity and actual
management requirements, as well as the assessment on the procurement capabilities of
FECO/MEP and beneficiary enterprises, the World Bank simplified its procurement procedure
by increasing the cap of each procurement methods by category, which greatly expedited the
project implementation.
3.1.2  Key decisions that hindered implementation
In order to ensure the phase-out targets achieved, except the independent verification on
production and consumption as per the requirements of the Secretariat, all sub-projects under
58


﻿ODS IV were required to accept the performance audit and financial audit conducted by the
China National Audit Office. Therefore, there were at least two or three times of
verification/audit taken in each sub-project's lifetime. All these work required considerable inputs
by the World Bank, FECO/MEP, expert team and beneficiary enterprises, which means a lot of
timing, funding and human resources. If the verification/audit could be done at once, the
efficiency of the project implementation would be improved at an extent.
3.1.3  Assessment of the World Bank supervision
According to the agreements between Chinese government and the Executive Committee, The
Bank was responsible for the overall supervision of the implementation of the sector plans and
projects under the ODS IV. The World Bank formed a managerial team composed by personnel
with professional backgrounds in project management, specific technology, financial and
procurement management, safeguard and legislative, so as to provide its supervision in a high
quality and high efficiency manner. The World Bank's team monitored the projects
implementation by providing its comments and suggestions through emails, telephones, Video
Conference meetings. Meanwhile, the team conducted at least three project monitoring missions
to China each year, worked together with FECO/MEP's staffs, to review the project progress,
identify/solve the potential problems or problems had encountered, prepare the documents for the
submission to the Executive Committee, on-site visiting to beneficiary enterprise, etc. The
missions brought very effective communication and played a very important role in developing
new projects, monitoring project implementation, and exchanging ideas and views of relevant
stakeholders. In order to identify the problems, verify the results of the projects and ensure the
compliance of China, the World Bank adopted independent verification, performance audit and
financial audit, in which, the independent verification was regarded as the most effective
approach to verify the production, import and export data of each year, to ensure the compliance
of China.
3.1.4  Key experiences and lessons learned
As the leading agency of the production sector, the World Bank kept close monitoring and
coordination with the phase-out progress in consumption sectors, as well as other developing
countries for estimation of the ODS consumption demand at overseas market. It was very
necessary to take similar actions in future's ODS phase-out activities.
During the development and implementation of the sector plan and projects, there were a number
of problems and difficulties encountered, the World Bank's team worked acted as a good bridge
of the communication between China and international community, which are expected to be
maintained and further strengthened.
In order to monitor the project progress timely, a management information system operated in
FECO/MEP was established. This system played a very good function in collect, summarize and
analyze information and generate progress report as required by the World Bank. In order to meet
the new demands, it is suggested to develop and establish a similar management information
system, with external interfaces to enable beneficiary enterprise and local EPBs to get access to
the system, so as to achieve on-line quota application, management and supervision.
3.2 Assessment of Government's actions during implementation
3.2.1  Key decisions facilitating implementation
At the earlier stage of ODS phase-out, Chinese government decided to establish the compliance
management framework that the actions should be undertaken synchronously in four aspects: reduction in
production, conversion in consumption, development of alternative and substitute, and establishment of
policy and regulation. So far, this framework has become a crucial foundation for China's compliance of
Montreal Protocol. It's noting that China took the lead in creation and innovation of the implementation
mode. In 1997, the Sector Plan for Halon phase-out in China was the first sector plan approved by the
59


﻿MLF. In addition, it was the first sector plan composed by production and consumption components. The
new mode contains all enterprises related in the industry and commits entire phase-out in sector level, so
as to prevent the circumstances that the pollution took place while the phase-out activities carried out.
Under the new mode, the functions and roles of relevant administrative departments and industry
associations were utilized completely, the flexibility was entrusted to Chinese government by the MLF,
and the phase-out cost was reduced. All these benefits facilitated the implementation of ODS IV project.
In past two decades, China issued more than 100 national and sectorial policies and regulations, in terms
of production, consumption, product quality and import & export management, and formed a policies and
regulation framework, in which the core is the quota license system and bans on newly construction,
modification and expansion of production lines. The provisions regarding the ODS phaseout was added
into the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Law when it was modified in 2000. This modification is the
basis for the ODS regulatory system in China. Since 2004, Chinese government decided to develop a
Regulation on ODS Management, in order to enhance the management of ODS. And then, a series of
preparatory work and investigation conducted. After more than six years' efforts, the regulation was
reviewed and approved in principle at the Executive Meeting of the State Council chaired by Premier
Wen Jiabao on Mar. 24, 2010, and entered into force since June 1, 2010. The issuing of regulation further
strengthen the ODS management, and increase the punishment of illegal acts, so as to provide the law
guarantee for sustainable compliance of Montreal Protocol in China.
In order to provide the guidance for the development of ODS alternatives and substitutes, Chinese
government supported and funded the formulation of the Strategy of development of ODS alternatives
and substitutes in China. Under the guidance of the strategy, Chinese government funded a number of
ODS alternative production projects as mentioned in item 3.1.1, after consultation with the World Bank.
So far, the fact proves that the success of these projects. By these projects, the production capacities not
only supplied the new demand as required in the consumption sectors, but also became a catalyst in the
chemical industry, to promote the research and development of ODS alternatives for a long period. In
2006, MEP updated the recommendation catalogue on ODS alternative and substitutes of each sector and
application. After several year's efforts, the enterprises and science and academic institutes have already
had strong R&D and production capacities. Therefore, the ODS phase-out action in China haven't
hindered the development of chemical industry, oppositely, it greatly promoted the industry structure
adjustment and upgrading.
3.2.2  Key decisions (or lack of) hindering implementation
Through participation of Capacity Building Project on ODS management (phase I), Local governments
haven't fully understood the overall work regarding implementation of Montreal Protocol, and their
policy enforcement and monitoring capacity still need to be improved.
A multiplicity of public awareness and training progremme have been carried out, however, public's
participation still is still not enough.
The incentive policies are to be developed and implemented.
3.2.3  Counterpart funds timely availability
During the implementation of the ODS IV projects, all the shortage of the funding for each sub-project
was paid by the enterprise, to ensure the project completed timely.
3.2.4  Key experiences and lessons learned
During the implementation of ODS IV project, Chinese government gave its special attention to
strengthen the capacity building of national office unit and the local government, as well as the
coordination and cooperation across administrative ministries/departments, production and consumption,
associations and enterprises. The coordination mechanism formed played very important role in past and
60


﻿is expected to work continually, in particular, to find the alternatives and substitutes in conformity with
the development trends in future.
A scientific and compensative policies and regulation system and management framework prevented
several potential problems.
4 Conclusion
Since acceding to the Protocol in 1991, China has gradually developed comprehensive policies,
regulations and a management system for the protection of the ozone layer. It has constantly strengthened
compliance through capacity building in various sectors and levels of Government, and has developed an
effective management mechanism. By 2010, China has successfully phased out a total of more than
100,000 tons of ODS production and 110,000 tons of ODS consumption. Among the achieved phaseout,
the ODS IV project implemented by the World Bank contributed a majority portion to the success.
The implementing work done by the Bank has displayed its professional performance in terms of project
development and design, sector plan preparation, supervision and monitoring, technical assistance,
coordination and communication with international stakeholders, sound and transparent management, as
well as innovative measures in the carrying on projects. The Bank helped the Chinese government
improve the capacity of project management and increase the R&D ability of the industries, which not
only secured the China's compliance of the Montreal Protocol but also brought social and economic
benefits to the society.

﻿Annex 8       Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders
Comments from the USEPA regarding the Accelerated Phase-out Plan (APP)
(collected through interview; text cleared by the USEPA)
The US EPA was involved in the China ODS IV Project at its outset through the provision of dedicated
advice in the design of the policy and regulatory objectives outlined in the first sector strategy prepared,
the Halon Sector Strategy. The US EPA welcomed the move towards the comprehensive sector approach
presented in the ODS IV Project as a logical management tool for the Government of China's ODS
Program.
The US $10 million Accelerated Phase-out Plan (APP), which used the bilateral funding window option
under the Multilateral Fund of the Montreal Protocol and was approved in 2004, was conceived as an
overlay of incentive funding that would accelerate the speed of phase-out for three approved production
sector plans: CFCs, Halons and CTC. The design of the APP was based on the recognition that a price
signal for the ODS, especially CFCs, had not yet occurred. Accelerated production sector phase-out in
China would therefore, facilitate the transition away from these ODS throughout the world, especially in
Article 5 Country Parties to the Protocol, the bulk of whom were addressing strictly consumption phase-
out yet continued to face an ongoing supply of these substances in the global market.
The APP facilitated the establishment of a comprehensive, fully national production sector initiative by
linking the three production sector phase-out plans. This, in turn, established the framework for holistic
national phase-out strategies across the MLF portfolio through 2010, and laid the groundwork for the
manner in which the MLF, its implementing agencies and Article 5 and donor countries are now
addressing the phase-out of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). It also demonstrated the value of
addressing the production sector upfront so that a price signal that better supports the transition can result
earlier, as witnessed by the HCFC production phase-out plan approved by the ExCom in the first stage of
the global HCFC phase-down that the World Bank is now implementing with the Chinese Government.
