Project will support the three pillars of Guinea's\n            poverty reduction strategy, and, cover the following\n            reforms, designed to help improve public services,\n            strengthen governance, and as a result, improve the\n            environment for investment, and growth. The reforms aim to\n            achieve: 1) more accountable, and efficient use of public\n            resources, through improved public expenditure analysis, and\n            management; 2) more effective government, through\n            decentralization of decision-making, and service delivery;\n            and, 3) improved public sector management, and more\n            efficient resource use through divestiture. The successful\n            implementation of the project will reinforce the\n            Government's capacity to improve public service\n            delivery, complement, and enhance the impact of other Bank\n            interventions, and, contribute to restore credibility to\n            public finances. However, risks affecting the reform program\n            are the fragile security situation, significant shortfalls\n            in revenue mobilization, which would threaten macroeconomic\n            reforms, and, inadequate human, and institutional\n            capacities, among others. Nonetheless, these risks are\n            offset by the reestablishment of a credible macroeconomic\n            environment, supported by strong political leadership, an\n            Institutional Development Fund grant for governance, and\n            integrity reforms to strengthen capacity, and, reforms in\n            public sector management."}, "docdt": "2001-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
