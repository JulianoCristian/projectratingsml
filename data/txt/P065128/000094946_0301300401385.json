"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The project's outcome is rated\n            satisfactory. The reforms supported by the project are\n            likely to be sustainable. Given the rating of lending and\n            supervision work, the Bank's overall performance is\n            rated satisfactory. The Borrower's overall performance\n            is rated satisfactory. Three major lessons emerge from\n            project experience: 1) The implementation of Components 1\n            and 2 underline the importance of continued broad\n            consultation, good communication, and capacity building. The\n            PRSP/CAS consultation of the Guinean population as to their\n            priorities and the maintenance of a flow of information\n            about budget allocations and priorities created strong\n            expectations and pressures with regard to the\n            decentralization of budgets, spending authority,\n            procurement, and ultimately the improvement of public\n            service delivery. The Borrower suggests that the\n            beneficiaries may not have realized the full weight and\n            scope of their new responsibilities under the decentralized\n            budget and suggests that continuing efforts in training, in\n            public information, and in providing local authorities with\n            the means to carry out their responsibilities must be\n            addressed in future operations. 2) Reagarding Component 3,\n            the main lesson is that it is always difficult to advance\n            structural reforms through adjustment lending, given the\n            short time frame, the lack of investment leverage in the\n            sector(s) concerned, and the absence of technical assistance\n            to guide the process and provide analytical assistance. In\n            this case, parallel implementation of a technical assistance\n            and institutional development support project on the\n            provision of funds in the budget could have maintained the\n            dialogue, strengthened the Privatization Unit and the DNP,\n            and carried on key studies such as company valuation and\n            social impact. Other factors, which explain why the project\n            could not move the disengagement process forward are that\n            workers (often unionized) must be reassured that the state\n            intends to look out for their welfare through consultation\n            on measures related to re-employment, re-training, and\n            self-employment. This requires substantial groundwork. While\n            a communications firm was hired to develop a strategic plan\n            in this area, this was too late to yield any results in the\n            project's timeframe. 3) SAC IV demonstrates the\n            importance of reforming budget procedures, notably through\n            decentralization and the development of reliable mechanisms\n            for monitoring and controlling public expenditure. Strong\n            popular support for the reform program and the existence of\n            tested mechanisms for consultation and communication could\n            contribute to the success of a future PRSC."}, "docdt": "2002-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
