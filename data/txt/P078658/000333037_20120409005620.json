Democratic\n            Republic of were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: assistance to children associated\n            with armed forces (particularly girls) that have children\n            themselves need to be varied and adapted to take into\n            account that their circumstances are similar to those of\n            adults. Therefore for some children's reintegration\n            package are not appropriate and the program needs to be\n            flexible and pragmatic to maximize their social and economic\n            reintegration. EDRP experience showed enhanced success rates\n            for both social and economic reintegration that targeted\n            support to economic associations which comprised of\n            ex-combatants and members of the community. Setting a\n            subordinate Pre-Demobilization Orientation Program PDOP that\n            the Disarmament, Demobilization, Repatriation (DDR) program\n            will result in a shift in military spending toward social\n            and economic expenditures was too ambitious and did not\n            include instruments to achieve it. This was particularly so\n            in a country where there was continuing conflict and the\n            Government had a policy of army integration to absorb other\n            armed groups which therefore increased the size of the military."}, "docdt": "2012-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
