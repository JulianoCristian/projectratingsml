The specific\n            objectives of the program will be a) to demobilize up to an\n            estimated 150,000 ex-combatants and to help support their\n            return into civilian life b) to promote the reallocation of\n            Government expenditure from military to social and economic\n            sectors. The project is expected to have a significant\n            impact o n reducing poverty in the DRC by: establishing more\n            secure conditions in the rural areas that will encourage the\n            general population and internally displaced persons to\n            resume productive lives in the rural economy; freeing up\n            additional national resources for investment in social and\n            economic sectors; and investing in the human capital of\n            ex-combatants. The project consists of the following\n            activities: (i) Sensitization; (ii) Orientation/\n            demobilization; (iii) Transition; (iv) Reinsertion; (v)\n            Special groups; and (vi) Institutional development and\n            Program implementation support. The following demobilization\n            activities are envisaged: (i) the establishment of\n            orientation centers; (ii) verification of ex-combatant\n            status; (iii) provision of identity cards; (iv) collection\n            of socio-economic data; (v) pre-demobilization orientation\n            about civilian life and program benefits; and (vi) medical\n            screening (including HIV/AIDS counseling and voluntary\n            testing). Demobilization activities will be guided by the\n            Joint Operations Plan, which coordinates the military\n            restructuring with the demobilization process. As a part of\n            reinsertion assistance, all ex-combatants would receive a\n            Basic Needs Kit (BNK). The BNK would provide the following\n            assistance to facilitate the initial transition to civilian\n            life of ex-combatants: (i) transport and food allowance,\n            most probably in the form of a $30 cash grant; (ii) basic\n            household items kit. A transitional subsistence allowance\n            will be provided in cash in installments.  Reintegration\n            assistance will be provided to help ex-combatants\n            re-introduce themselves into their communities and establish\n            sustainable livelihoods. The following activities would form\n            the core of the assistance provided to ex-combatants during\n            this phase: provision of information, counseling and\n            referral services; vocational training, formal and informal\n            apprenticeship schemes, and educational opportunities."}, "docdt": "2004-05-03T00:00:00Z"}
