                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The objectives of the project are to: (i) demobilize an estimated 150,000 ex-combatants and support their transition to civilian life; and (ii) contribute to the
                         reallocation of Government expenditure from defense to social and economic sectors.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         After project restructuring in July 2010 an intensive period followed from August to October 2010. This comprised discussions with the Government counterpart and the implementing
                         agencies on the exact nature of the reintegration activities to be extended during the final period to closure. These discussions took longer than anticipated due to a debate over

                         individual vs collective entitlements; eventually consensus was achieved around the approach of supporting associations formed by both ex-combatants and civilians.

                         This was then followed by an intense period of contract and budget preparation by the implementing partners - already specified in the financing agreement and therefore there were
                         no delays with procurement. These were then processed in November/ December and a full work plan, budget and procurement plan was produced by the Project Unit in January
                         2011.

                         Activities resumed by the implementing partners in January/ February 2010 providing livelihood support to ex-combatants through the associations. Supervision missions were
                         undertaken throughout this period in particular with technical assistance in drawing up and implementing a monitoring and evaluation plan. Beneficiary tracer surveys will start at th
                         end of March.

                         The project is in very good shape for satisfactory closure in September 2011.
