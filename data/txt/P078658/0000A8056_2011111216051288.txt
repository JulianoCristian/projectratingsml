                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The objectives of the project are to: (i) demobilize an estimated 150,000 ex-combatants and support their transition to civilian life; and (ii) contribute to the
                         reallocation of Government expenditure from defense to social and economic sectors.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         After project restructuring in July 2010, a period of four months was required to re contract the existing partners and launch procurement of sub-project inputs. Implementation
                         resumed by the five implementing partners in December 2010 providing livelihood support to ex-combatants through collective associations. This last phase has focused on providing
                         technical and in-kind support to over 1,000 community and ex-combatant associations undertaking farm and non-farm activities. In this way, some 30,000 ex-combatants have been
                         receiving additional reintegration support with a view to sustaining the results of the project.

                         In turn, the extension period has been used for an increase in technical support and supervision missions with a focus on the implementation of a comprehensive Monitoring and
                         Evaluation Plan (one of the key weaknesses identified at the restructuring stage). Beneficiary tracer surveys were started at the end of March by the national statistical institute (INS)
                         and were concluded in July 2011. Those surveys have been used to underpin a series of qualitative and quantitative analysis of various aspects of the program including the
                         following: status of adults, status of children and women, status of children turned to adults during the program and the few handicapped. It has also fed into the final evaluation of the
                         project undertaken by the Government project implementation team.

                         The project has a 98% disbursement rate. The Government is seeking a longer than usual grace period for completion (six months) due to the complexity of the project and the
                         number of partners who will be audited.
