Since\n            2000, considerable progress has been made to restore peace\n            and security, but the situation remains very volatile in\n            North and South kivu. The 2006 democratic elections of the\n            President, Parliament, and provincial authorities now\n            present a unique window of opportunity for the World Bank to\n            support the DRC in consolidating and expanding peace and\n            development gains while attenuating the risk of renewed\n            conflict. In order to address the urgency of the maintaining\n            peace in the country's eastern regions, the Government\n            has asked the association to provide for the possibility of\n            retroactive financing that corresponds to its counterpart\n            requirement under the African Development Bank parallel\n            project. The proceeds of the additional financing will be\n            used to support the following activities which were included\n            as part of the original Project: (a) demobilization of\n            combatants; (b) reinsertion support to newly demobilized ex\n            combatants; (c) reintegration support for demobilized\n            ex-combatants; (d) release of children from armed forces;\n            and (e) specialized support for disabled ex-combatants."}, "docdt": "2008-03-27T00:00:00Z"}
