foreign\n            exchange; and to build the institutional framework and data\n            base for the national smallholder rubber program. In\n            particular, the project would (a) plant and maintain until\n            maturity about 38,500 ha of smallholder rubber, and maintain\n            a further 8,000 ha planted during 1975-79; (b) develop\n            nurseries to provide high-yielding clonal planting material;\n            (c) construct village and estate-type roads to facilitate\n            input distribution and rubber marketing; (d) strengthen the\n            implementing units through recruitment, training and\n            technical assistance; and (e) carry out studies, pilot\n            programs and start-up activities for future projects."}, "docdt": "1980-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
