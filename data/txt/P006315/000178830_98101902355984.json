    SINSC will include: (i) a real-time supervision system\n            (RTSS) to be located at a national supervision and\n            coordination center (CSC) in Brasilia (to be owned and\n            operated by ELETROBRAS/GCOI); (ii) data acquisition and\n            control systems (DACS) to be located at the systems\n            operations centers (COSs) of Brazil's nine major\n            electric power companies and the Itaipu hydroelectric plant;\n            and (iii) telecommunications links. The project consists of\n            the initial components of SINSC which are at an advanced\n            stage of preparation: the national Center (CSC) in Brasilia,\n            and the systems operations (COS) of CHESF, one of\n            ELETROBRAS' major subsidiaries. The project also\n            includes a sector-wide training program to be carried by\n            ELETROBRAS. SINSC is expected to result in overall\n            improvement in sector management, significant future\n            reductions in capital investments in generation and\n            transmission facilities, lower reserve requirements for such\n            facilities, lower requirements for fossil fuels for power\n            generation, improvements for fossil fuels for power\n            generation, improvements in reliability of electricity\n            supply, and less industrial output."}, "docdt": "1980-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
