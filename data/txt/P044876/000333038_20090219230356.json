development outcome\n            was moderate, Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: efforts to improve quality will not\n            succeed unless there are capable subject teachers. Teacher\n            provisioning especially in mathematics, English and science\n            has been a significant challenge in secondary schools.\n            Schools which have the requisite number of teachers, the\n            focus is now on improving teacher quality through changes in\n            classroom practices, supported by on-site support. The\n            Government's strategy to promote education for girls\n            through demand-side interventions has proven successful in\n            expanding access to education. This approach should be\n            extended to promote education for poor boys and girls.\n            Community involvement is essential for improving service\n            delivery in remote and disadvantaged areas and for ensuring\n            project sustainability. When communities have meaningful\n            responsibilities, control over resources, and are\n            accountable, they become actively engaged in project\n            activities, thereby bolstering community participation.\n            Establishing a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation\n            system is critical in ensuring that the approaches adopted\n            by the project under various components are properly\n            evaluated. This will help determine whether the project is\n            meeting its goals and objective, and also provide\n            information/data for real-time corrective action."}, "docdt": "2008-12-26T00:00:00Z"}
