previously irrigated on both banks\n            of the Lower Euphrates River in North Eastern Syria. Under\n            the project, 170 tubewells operated by electric pumps would\n            be installed to lower the saline water table by pumping from\n            a gravel aquifer under the riverine plain into open drains\n            leading to the Euphrates River. A total of 450 km of open\n            drains to handle pumped and surface water, 200 km of pumping\n            station access roads, 240 km of 22 kV power lines and\n            buildings for operation and maintenance and research and\n            extension operations, would be constructed. Consultants\n            would be appointed to assist the General Administration for\n            the Development of the Euphrates Basin, the agency\n            responsible for implementing the project. Consultants would\n            carry out detailed hydrogeological investigations on about\n            65,000 ha not already covered in the preparation phase,\n            supervise the construction and installation work under the\n            project and establishment of an operation and maintenance\n            service, supply engineering services for the design of\n            works, assist in a crop research and extension program."}, "docdt": "1979-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
