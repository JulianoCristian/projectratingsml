                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The original Project development objectives are: (a) improving energy efficiency in heating buildings in order to make heating more affordable and improving functional
                         and health environment of the users; and (b) reducing the local and global environmental impact of the use of dirty fuels for heating buildings) and monitoring indicators
                         have remained unchanged. The principal aim of the Additional Financing is to enable the Borrower to complete the original scope of the Project (energy efficiency
                         improvements in 3 social care buildings, 9 schools and 6 hospitals left out due to a cost overrun) and to scale up energy efficiency improvements to include: (a)
                         rehabilitation of the heat supply system of the Nis Clinical Center along with energy efficiency improvements in all 17 contiguous buildings on the campus; complete
                         retrofitted lighting in a number of schools and (b) energy efficiency improvements in a number of social care institutions, schools and hospitals across Serbia.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is performing satisfactorily. Through its implementation, 62 public buildings (23 hospitals, 14 schools, and one social care institution) were retrofitted and the heath supply
                         system at the Nis Clinical Center (NCC) has been rehabilitated. Overall, the project has been providing energy and cost saving benefits of about 40% on average in public buildings,
                         developing and testing buildings’ technical standards, and laying out the foundations for an energy service industry in a growing energy efficiency market.
