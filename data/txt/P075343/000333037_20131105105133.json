         negligible, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: technical monitoring should\n            be designed and implemented with adequate metering tools to\n            provide solid information that can inform the\n            decision-making process during implementation. The\n            project's energy efficiency investments into\n            essentially social public buildings had a catalytic effect\n            on local markets by demonstrating the exemplary role of the\n            government to the private sector and general public, while\n            at the same time stimulating nascent markets for EE goods\n            and services. During design and implementation supervision,\n            special attention should be given to ensuring that\n            implementation arrangements are fully integrated within the\n            government administration to build capacity. One of the key\n            issues is to ensure the sustainability of new dedicated\n            non-revenue earning and budget-dependent agencies (such as\n            energy efficiency agencies) by ensuring that their\n            organizational policies should not be too divergent from\n            other budget entities."}, "docdt": "2013-10-30T00:00:00Z"}
