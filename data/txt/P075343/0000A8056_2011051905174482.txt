                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the project is to improve energy efficiency in heating buildings in order to make heating more affordable as well as improve the
                         functional and health environment of the users. An important associated objective is to reduce the local and global environmental impact of the use of dirty
                         fuels for heating buildings in Serbia.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?
