                        SERBIA - ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECT P075343
                           CREDIT NO. 3870-1 YF, LOAN NO. 7466 YF


1. The Closing Date for the Serbia Energy Efficiency Project, Credit No. 3870-1 YF, and Loan No.
7466 YF, P075343 will be extended from October 31, 2011, until April 30, 2013. All expenditures have
been paid from IDA Credit 38700 and the Designated Account was fully documented on September 30,
2011, therefore, this credit will close as scheduled on October 31, 2011.

2.  DISBURSEMENT WAS LOW DUE TO ADDITIONAL TIME REQUIRED FOR COMPLEX
PROCUREMENT PACKAGES BUT PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION IMPROVED
SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS WITH THE AWARD OF TWO LARGE
CONTRACTS, NAMELY: (I) REHABILITATION OF THE NIS CLINICAL CENTER, AND (II)
REHABILITATION OF 20 PUBLIC BUILDINGS. PROGRESS WILL CONTINUE WITH
TENDERING UNDERWAY FOR TWO LARGE ADDITIONAL PACKAGES FOR
REHABILITATION OF PUBLIC BUILDINGS. THE PROJECT MONITORING INDICATORS
HAVE NOT CHANGED AND THE PROJECT OBJECTIVES ARE LIKELY TO BE ACHIEVED
WITH THE EXTENSION OF THE CLOSING DATE. THE NEW PROJECT TEAM IS SATISFIED
WITH THE ACTION PLAN OF THE BORROWER FOR SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE
PROJECT AND WILL CLOSELY MONITOR PROGRESS TO ENSURE THAT THE ESTABLISHED
TARGETS WILL BE MET BY THE END OF THE EXTENSION PERIOD.

3. THE REMAINING CRITICAL TASKS ARE: (I) COMPLETION OF REHABILITATION OF
HEAT SUPPLY SYSTEM AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS IN THE NIS CLINICAL
CENTER, FOR WHICH THE CONTRACT WAS AWARDED IN JUNE 2011, AND COMPLETION
OF WORKS IS EXPECTED BY APRIL 2012; AND (II) COMPLETION OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY
IMPROVEMENTS IN PUBLIC BUILDINGS IN BATCHES. THE CONTRACT FOR A FIRST
BATCH OF 20 SITES WAS AWARDED IN JUNE 2011, AND COMPLETION IS EXPECTED BY
DECEMBER 31, 2011. THE TARGET DATE FOR CONTRACT AWARD FOR A SECOND BATCH
OF 26 SITES IS OCTOBER 2011 AND COMPLETION IS EXPECTED BY JUNE 2012. THE
TARGET FOR CONTRACT AWARD FOR A THIRD BATCH OF 20 SITES IS JUNE 2012, AND
COMPLETION EXPECTED IN APRIL 2013.

4.    The requirements of OP/BP13.30 have been met, namely, (a) the project objectives continue to be
achievable; (b) the performance of the Borrower and other project implementing agencies is satisfactory;
and (c) the Borrower has prepared a specific Action Plan acceptable to the Bank to complete the project
within the proposed extended timeframe. There are no outstanding audits. No new safeguards policies
will be triggered and there are no changes proposed to the environmental assessment category B.
