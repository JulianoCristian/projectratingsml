                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The original Project development objectives are: (a) improving energy efficiency in heating buildings in order to make heating more affordable and improving functional
                         and health environment of the users; and (b) reducing the local and global environmental impact of the use of dirty fuels for heating buildings) and monitoring indicators
                         have remained unchanged. The principal aim of the Additional Financing is to enable the Borrower to complete the original scope of the Project (energy efficiency
                         improvements in 3 social care buildings, 9 schools and 6 hospitals left out due to a cost overrun) and to scale up energy efficiency improvements to include: (a)
                         rehabilitation of the heat supply system of the Nis Clinical Center along with energy efficiency improvements in all 17 contiguous buildings on the campus; complete
                         retrofitted lighting in a number of schools and (b) energy efficiency improvements in a number of social care institutions, schools and hospitals across Serbia.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The energy system conversion and modernization at the Clinical Center of Belgrade (switch from dirty fuels to gas) was completed. Savings arising from the energy system
                         rehabilitation has saved the budget of the Ministry of Health (over the heating season 2009/2010) around 75 million Serbian dinars (around US$ 1 million), while the earnings that
                         were made by delivering heat to third parties has profited the Clinical Center of Serbia around 53 million Serbia dinars (around US$ 600,000).

                         Furthermore, 37 public buildings (23 hospitals, 14 schools, and one social care institution) were retrofitted, and energy consumption was reduced by an average 40 percent.
                         In addition, rehabilitation of heath supply system in the Clinical Center of Nis is ongoing, and energy efficiency measure will be introduced into 10-12 new public building by the end of
                         project (April 30, 2013).
