1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$hO million to
Turkiye Sinai Kalkinma Bankasi A.S. or Industrial Development Bank of
Turkey (TSKB), to be guaranteed by the Republic of Turkey.
PART I. HISTORICAL
2.        The proposed loan would be the ninth Bark loan or IDA credit for
TSKB and the twentieth for Turkey.   The last lending to TSKB was a Bank
loan of $25 million, which was made in March 1969 and is fully committed;,
about $11 million had been disbursed up to October 31, 1970.   The project
was appraised in June/July 1970.   Negotiations on the proposed loan took
place in Washington from October 13 to October 20, 1970.    The representatives
of the Borrower were led by Mr. Bulent Yazici, Managing Director of TSIB,
and included Mr. Resid Egeli, General Manager, lIr. Orhan Eroguz, Assistant
General Manager, and Mr. Ibrahim Cngut, Chief Economist.   Mr. A. Tufan Gul,
Economic Counselor of the Turkish Dnbassy, and MLr. Teoman Koprululer,
Financial Counselor, represented the Guarantor.
3.        The following is a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits
to Turkey as at October 31, 1970:

4.        Execution of power and agriculture projects has been somewhat
slow. The Second Cukurova Power project (59-TU) was delayed by serious
problems with the construction of -the tunnel, but is now progressing
satisfactorily. Cost estimates for the Third Cukurova Power project
(623-TU) did not foresee the recent world-wide price increases and there
have been cost overruns. The Bank is considering a supplementary loan
to the Cukurova Elektrik Co. to finance part of these overruns and some
further additions to Cukurova's transmission system. The Keban hydro-
electric project financed by members of the Keban Syndicate has been
delayed two years because of difficulties with foundation of the dam.
The associated transmission line project, financed by the Bank (568-TU),
is progressing satisfactorily. Progress with on-farm development under
the Seyhan Irrigation Projects, which had been disappointing until 1967,
is now satisfactory. A large number of bids are about to be awarded and
the project is on schedule.
5.        Further projects in technical education, in agriculture (fresh
fruits and vegetables, livestock and forestry), and in industry (power
and fertilizer) are now under consideration.
6.        IFC carries in its portfolio investments in the Industrial
Development Bank of Turkey (TSKB), Sentetik Iplik Fabrikalari (SIFAS)
(textiles), Viking Kagit ve Seluloz (paper mill), Anadolu Glass Co.
(ACS) and NASAS Aluminium Co., and is prepared to finance industrial
projects in various stages of analysis or discussion, including nylon-
yarn, soda ash, zinc smelting, dairy products, tourism, tire cord and
fertilizers.

PIRT III. THE PRCJECT
8.        A report ex.titled "Appraisal of ?urkiye Sinai Kalkinma Bankasi
A.S." (DB-73a, dated INovember 6, 1970) is attached.
9.        Industry in Turkey has contrasting aspects;   on the one hand
it still makes a relatively low contribution to NDP (19 per cent),
employment (10 per cent) and exports (20 per cent), while on the other
hand it is growing rapidly (10 per cent per year) and has become
increasingly diversified. The output of manufacturing industry nearly
doubled over the six-year period 1963-69. While state enterprises still
play a dominant role, particularly in basic industries, there has been a
strong upsurge of private manufacturing industry. Turkish industry in
general has been inward-oriented with little regard for cost competitive-
ness. With investment decisions being made within a high protective wal'..
in an economy where market forces have had little free play, increases in
productive capacity have not always been on a competitive basis.
10..      During the 1960's a new class of industrial entrepreneurs
emerged, increasingly capable and outward-looking. Foreign investments
in manufacturing industries have increased in recent years due to a more
encouraging attitude of Government and have facilitated the introduction
of new techniques. There appears to be great scope for further growth
in both export-oriented industries using domestic raw materials (food
processing, forest products, cotton textiles, and boron products) and in
import replacement (steel, motor vehicles, heavy engineering and
fertilizers).
11.       The Industrial Development Bank of Turkey (TSKB) was the first
development finance company which the Bank helped establish 20 years ago,
and one of the first in which IFC participated as an investor. TSKB's
capital base has expanded from an initial share capital of TL 12.5 million
to a present net worth of TL 204 million; it has committed $150 million
in foreign exchange loans, TL 800 million in local currency loans and
TL 200 million in equity participations. Bank loans and IDA credits have
totalled $88 million. IFC's present investment in TSKB is about
$1.3 million (at cost) representing about 10 per cent of TSKB's share
capital.
12.       TSKB's major contribution has been to serve as a vehicle through-
which substantial funds could be channelled to Turkish industry on the
basis of a careful appraisal process. TSKB now has loans outstanding to
over 400 companies. The sound performance of its portfolio over a 20
year span bears witness to TSKB's ability to judge the financial prospects
of its clients. TSKB has also been fairly active in acquiring and then
selling equities to the public. More recently it has started issuing and
guaranteeing the bonds of its clients. Realizing the distortions in the
Turkish pricing mnechanism and the highly protected nature of Turkish



iL.dustry, TSKB has been subjecting the projects proposed to it to tests
measuring effective protection and international competitiveness in
order to avoid financing enterprises and projects which could not compete
in an open econoqy.
13.       The recent devaluation has increased in lira terms the debts
owed to TSKB by its clients in foreign exchange. Although it is too
early to determine with precision the full financial impact of the new
lira/dollar rate on TSKB's clients, an analysis of TSKB's portfolio
has indicated that while some re-scheduling might be necessary, it is
unlikely that the devaluation will cause its borrowers serious problems.
TSKB's own liquidity is such that it should be able to service its
external debt without difficulty.
14.       Prior to 1965, with the exception of a 1958 DLF loan of
$10 million, TSKB depended entirely on Bank/IDA financing for its foreign
exchange resources. However, in the last five years it has succeeded in
broadening its sources of foreign exchange, which now include the
European Investment Bank and the Kreditanstalt fUr Wiederaufbau. It has
not been practicable for TSKB to borrow in markets abroad because of
Turkey's overall economic situation and the high interest rates it would
have had to pay. As Turkey liberalizes its economy TSKB should be able
to join with foreign enterprises on a joint-venture basis. TSKB might well
be able to assist this movement. TSKB should also be able to borrow
abroad.
15.       TSKB's foreign exchange needs for 1971 and 1972 are conservatively
estimated at about $80 million. Of this amount, other foreign lenders
are likely to provide about $25 million. The proposed $h0 million Bank
loan would cover a substantial amount of the remaining gap but would not
remove pressure on TSKB to seek additional foreign exchange resources
elsewhere. The loan is expected to be fully disbursed by the end of
FY 1975. As far as lire funds are concerned, TSKB should be able to
raise enough to make loans and equity investments of about LT 120 million
per annum in 1971 and 1972. It also expects to continue mobilizing funds
for its clients by assisting them in issuing bonds.
16.       Prior to the devaluation TSKB was charging interest at 9 per
cent on foreign exchange loans, at 10.5 per cent on its own lire funds,
and at 8 per cent on lire resources provided by the Government and was
not allowed to charge more. Being limited to these rates TSKB could
not afford to raise funds by borrowing in the market. Following devalu-
ation the basic lending rate was increased to 10.5 per cent on loans to
"promoted" industries, which is a broad list, and to 11.5 per cent on all
other loans.  TSKB will increase its present lending rates to these legal
maxima. It is expected that about 70 per cent of TSKB's lending will
qualify for the 10.5 per cent rate, and the rest for the 11.5 per cent
rate. The actual cost to borrowers, including the 25 per cent tax



- 6 -
payable on interest charges, at the two rates would be 13.1 per cent
and 14.4 per cent respectively. The application of the new rates to
TSKB's lending will be a significant improvement on what it has been
able to charge in the past, although these rates are still below the
15-17 per cent which sub-borrowers would have to pay for 5-year
industrial bonds.
17.       In views of the need for Turkey to increase industrial exports,
TSKB will give special attention in future to the identification and
financing of projects with direct foreign exchange earnings.
Similarly, TSKB hopes to diversify its financing geographically. In
the past its activities have been over-concentrated in the Istanbul and
Marmara Sea areas.
18.       On the basis of its projected activities, TSKB's total assets
will increase from about LT 1,890 million at the end of 1970 to about
LT 2,300 million at the end of 1972, and further to LT 3,260 million at
the end of 1974. The ratio of total long term debt (including the
Government subordinated loan and guaranteed bonds) to equity is pro-
jected to fluctuate between 7.5:1 and 8.6:1 during the 1970-1975 period.
The debt/equity ratio, excluding subordinated debt and guarantees, will
rise from 3.3:1 to the maximum limit of 4:1 at the end of 1973. Further
capital increases may be required subsequently. TSKB's profits after
taxes are expected to grow from LT 38 million in 1970 to LT 50 million
in 1974 and would fluctuate between 18.7 per cent and 20.5 per cent
during the period. Dividends on its ordinary shares are forecast to
remain constant at 12 per cent. The overall debt service cover will be
1.9 times in 1970, 1.6 times in 1971 and 1.5 times in 1972 to 1974
inclusive.

PART V. THE ECONOIrY
20.       The last economic report on Turkey (EaA-4a dated February 13,
1969) described Turkey's economic performance under the First Five-Year
Plan 1963-67, and appraised the country's prospects during the Second
Five-Year Plan 1968-72. The limitations of existing policies and the
steps necessary for improvement were examined in that report. Another
comprehensive ecmnomic report is now in the final stages of preparation,
based upon the findings of an economic mission which visited Turkey in
April and May 1970, and an updating mission in September 1970. Meanwhile,
the following summarizes the Bank's conclusion on the Turkish economy.
A basic data sheet is attaclhed.
Background
21.       Turkey is undergoing an economic, political and social trans-
formation which is taking place at a quick pace. An increasingly
dynamic economy, a more differentiated social structure characterized by
greater mobility, and a more open political order based on concensus,
are emerging. Rapid economic growth and progress towards efficient
government are proceeding simultaneously.
22.       During the 1960's Turkey has enjoyed the longest period of
consistent and rapid growth in its history and this experience has given
confidence in the future to the Government and to ordinary citizens.
The First (1963-67) and Second (1968-72) Five-Year Plans and the con-
stituent annual programs have made for better balancing of savings and
investment, more rational allocation of resources, and generally more
consistent Government economic policies. Since 1963 the Government has
demonstrated its ability to achieve a rate of growth averaging over 6.5
per cent per year. However, the process of mobilizing and redeploying
resources has led to pressure on prices and on the balance of payments.
By 1970, rescurces had come under excessive strain and this was reflected
in rapidly rising prices, acute foreign exchange shortages, with severe
restrictions on imports, and persistent budget deficits.
23.       To seek a way out of this fundamental disequilibrium, to ensure
a more efficient allocation of resources and to help to strengthen the
balance of payments, the Government of Turkey devalued the Turkish lira
on August 9, 1970 and introduced a comprehensive stabilization program.
The new par value of the Turkish lira was established at TL 15 per US$1,
compared to TL 9 per US$1 previously. The stabilization program provides
for measures to complement devaluation, namely, elimination of the delays
in allocating foreign exchange, restoration of prompt Payments
introduction of a new import licensing procedure, reduction of the stamp
duty and the advance import guarantee deposits on imports. Steps have
been taken already to simplify the system of export tax rebates. The



Government has reiterated its intention to balance the budget for 1971;
it has already taken a number of measures to increase taxation and to
slow down the rate of growth of consumption.   The fiscal program has
been supplemented by action of the monetary authorities in making higher
interest rates effective and in curbing the growth of domestic credit.
Growth Prospects
24.       1968 was a year of rapid growth wiith GNP in real terms rising by
6.8 per cent compared with 6.7 per cent in 1967.   1969 was another good
year with GNP rising 6.6 per cent, and on the basis of recent economic
changes, Turkey can aim at a real growth rate of 7 per cent per annum and
still maintain a reasonable degree of internal price stability.   Mainly
responsible for maintaining the growth rate in 1968 and 1969 has been
expansion of industrial production and to some extent acceleration of
construction activity.   Despite a shortfall in the wheat crop in 1968 and
the disappointing outcome of the Wheat Program based on new strains in
1969, an underlying improvement in activity is taking place in agriculture,
which will result in the sector as a whole becoming less vulnerable to the
influence of climatic factors.   A continuing 7 per cent growth rate target
is realistic provided Turkey gets more for its investment than it has
hitherto, provided there is effective management of the budget and effective
control of demand, and provided these objectives are pursued in a flexible
manner.   Such a growth rate would still leave room for a significant amount
of liberalization, particularly if the expected benefits of past and ongoing
investments in import substitution industries are effectively realized.
This would represent an achievement without precedent in Turkish development,
but is nonetheless a reasonable and necessary objective.
Balance of Payments
25.       Turkey's foreign trade situation since 1968 has been overshadowed
by disappointing export performance, and increased i-mports and, during 1969
in particular, the expectation of a change in the exchange rate.    In 1969,
however, exports began to pick up somewhat while imports were held down by
exchange controls.   Since exports consist predominantly of unprocessed
agricultural commodities they are particularly sensitive to effects of
adverse weather conditions on agricultural production.    The heritage of an
earlier disinterest in exports, particularly industrial exports, and the
overriding importance given to imrport substitution is now emerging clearly
in terms of high costs, lack of competitiveness and marketing difficulties.
The Turkish authorities are now extremely conscious of the vulnerability of
the present range of exports and the priority that needs to be given to
export promotion in future.   There is also increasing export consciousness
in the business community.
26.       The many export incentives which have long existed have recently
been increased, and in particular the export rebate system which has a
substantial impact on both traditional and manufactured products.   The
Government expects that exports in 1970 will increase by about 10 per cent



- 9 -
over 1969, which if realised will mainly be due to a significant increase
in exports of certain processed and manufactured products, particularly
textiles and clothing.
27.       Imports in 1968 and 1969 increased by 11.5 per cent and 5 per cent,
respectively, but much of the increase reflected high deliveries of
investment goods under aid-financed agreements, with imports under the
liberalized list and global quotas increasing by much less.   Imports in
1970 are expected to increase at an even higher rate than in 1968.   The
current account deficit rose from $116 million in 1967 to $221 million in
1969, which reflects the continuing structural imbalance in the relative
growth of imports and exports and the difficulty of increasing earnings
from tourism.   Turkey has been fortunate in the high and growing invisible
earnings from its workers in Europe ($141 million in 1969 and about $200
million expected in 1970).
External Aid and External Debt
28.       In order to meet its development targets over the next few years,
Turkey is assumed to receive about the same amount of aid from Consortium
members as in the recent past, but with a growing amount of project aid
displacing program aid, and it is assumed that there would be a gradual
hardening of terms from under 4 per cent to an average of 5-6 per cent,
and that funds under the existing aid agreement with the USSR would be fully
disbursed by 1977.   These assumptions would involve an average capital
inflow of about $360 million per year, rising from $321 million in 1969 to
a peak of $370 million in 1974 and 1975 and levelling off thereafter at a
slightly lower figure.
29.       Debt service charges on this new debt would increase only slowly
at first but after 1973 the increase would be significant and total
additional charges in 1977 might reach around $116 million.   Total debt
service on existing debt and new debt would by then be $235 million.   This
would represent a high figure in absolute terms, but in relation to expected
export earnings (i.e. goods and non factor services) the debt service ratio
would remain virtually unchanged throughout the period 1971-1977 at
approximately 17 per cent, compared with 20 per cent in 1969 and about
23 per cent in 1970.   The latter ratio can be expected to drop, because
of the refinancing in 1970 and subsequent rescheduling of a large debt out-
standing to the EMA and partly to the prospect of a steady growth in export
earnings.   However, there are important additional short-term obligations
to the IMF not included in the proposed debt service plan and the concessionaa\
terms of borrowing assumed in the Bank's projections for the period 1970-75
may not be obtainable.

Conclusion
30.       It is possible for Turkey to become viable within a decade but
this depends on a high degree of commitment to development objectives by
the Government, as well as on a high degree of self restraint in the pursuit
of other national objectives.   The Turkish economy remains vulnerable.
Its reserves are inadequate and there is as yet no clear assurance that it
will attain the necessary rate of growth of exports and invisible earnings.
Successful implementation of the economic policy measures required to make
progress towards external viability is likely to depend on at least the
maintenance of the present level of external capital inflow over the next
several years, a large part of it being on concessionary terms.
31.       The results of the recent stabilization agreement and the
additional efforts required to increase Turkey's creditworthiness, will
be kept under continuing review.   The proposed loan seems to be especially
appropriate under Turkey's present economic circumstances, since it would
(a) contribute to meeting the foreign exchange requirements of investments
in the private sector, the encouragement of which is one of the aims of the
recent stabilization program, and (b) help to improve the balance of payments
through support of export oriented industries.   In the light of all the
above factors I consider that Turkey is creditworthy for the proposed loan.
PART VI. COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
32.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII.  RECOMENDATION
33.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
