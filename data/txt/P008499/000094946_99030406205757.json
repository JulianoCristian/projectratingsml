efficiency of roads and road transport\n            subsectors in Kazakhstan. There are five main components.\n            The first rehabilitates priority sections of national roads\n            by funding civil works to repair road sections; to\n            reconstruct, relocate, or replace bridges; and to build a\n            road bypass. The second component strengthens routine road\n            maintenance by building the maintenance capability of the\n            state road enterprise and road maintenance companies; and\n            finances maintenance equipment and spare parts. The third\n            component strengthens the roads department of a key road\n            maintenance and construction organization by establishing\n            procedures in planning, budgeting, and monitoring as well as\n            in supervising roadworks; training contractors in bid\n            preparation, contract administration, cost control,\n            management, and quality control; and strengthening the road\n            department's training capability. The fourth component\n            improves the enforcement of road transport policies and\n            regulations, improves systems to collect and process data,\n            and develops a more competitive market for inter-city and\n            rural passenger transport services. The fifth component\n            improves road safety."}, "docdt": "1999-01-05T00:00:00Z"}
