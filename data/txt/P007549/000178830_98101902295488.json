Total loan approvals over this period\n            are projected at US$212 million equivalent, of which about\n            90 percent for construction of 20,800 new hotel rooms.\n            FONATUR will also carry out (i) a study of the demand for\n            trained hotel personnel and sectoral training programs; and\n            (ii) a study to identify means of increasing employment\n            opportunities in tourism projects. Net foreign exchange\n            earnings generated by FONATUR's hotel financing program\n            will amount to some US$3 billion during the life of the\n            assisted subprojects.
