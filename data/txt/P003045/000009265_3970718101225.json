sedimentary\n            basins.  The project includes: (a) a technical assistance\n            component to strengthen DME's technical capability to\n            administer the hydrocarbon sector and to arrange for the\n            timely development of new fields; and (b) an exploration\n            promotion component aimed at establishing the basic\n            information necessary to promote new areas for exploration.\n            The project would support GOZ's efforts to strengthen\n            the administration of the hydrocarbon sector and to increase\n            production in the Coastal Basin which would help generate\n            additional export earnings and tax revenues.  The project\n            would also promote other prospective areas for exploration\n            by oil companies."}, "docdt": "1983-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
