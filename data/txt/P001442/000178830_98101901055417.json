lower Bong County as well\n            as to part of the adjacent Gibi Territory. The project would\n            include: (i) supply of agricultural inputs to improve\n            production of upland and swamp rice, cassava, other food\n            crops and coffee; (ii) expansion and improvement of\n            extension services and staff training. The project would\n            also involve (iii) agricultural research and development of\n            improved plant production material; (iv) strengthening of\n            cooperatives and the Agricultural and Cooperative\n            Development Bank (ACDB) to improve input supply, credit and\n            marketing services.
