sustainability, moderate institutional development and\n            satisfactory performances by both the Bank and the Borrower.\n            Technical difficulties, not anticipated during the\n            preparation, and associated with the implementation of the\n            pension reform and reconciliation of human resources\n            database required two extensions in the project closing\n            date.  Lessons were learned in the areas of choice of\n            instrument; project preparation; and project supervision.\n            Lessons included the following: A strong link exists between\n            the use of technical knowledge and expertise in the\n            preparation and program success. There are environments in\n            which our traditional lending instruments are inadequate.\n            Evaluating the internal institutional context and the\n            internal decision-making process is necessary to mitigate\n            the likelihood of failure.  Adjustment credits in\n            capacity-poor environments demand monitoring and evaluation\n            mechanisms even more thorough than those of traditional\n            adjustment operations. There is a clear correlation between\n            the capacity on the ground and the closeness of supervision\n            to be provided."}, "docdt": "2004-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
