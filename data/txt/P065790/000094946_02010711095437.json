{"cdata!": "The Fiscal Consolidation Credit Project\n            will support fiscal sustainability through structural, and\n            institutional reforms, to positively impact public finances.\n            Consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy, and\n            conditional on its successful implementation, the project\n            will lay the foundation for future support to the\n            country's economic growth, and reform agenda. Project\n            actions will improve budgetary management, particularly in\n            clearing domestic payment arrears, will contain the public\n            sector wage bill, implement a parametric reform to improve\n            the viability of the existing pay-as-you-go pension system,\n            and, strengthen the financial management of key public\n            enterprises that provide infrastructure services, thus\n            initiating a process of sector liberalization, and\n            privatization. Although risks include weak institutional\n            capacity, resistance by interest groups, and slippages in\n            the macroeconomic program, these will be mitigated by\n            focusing on few key reforms through the provision of\n            technical assistance, and, by implementing reforms in\n            collaboration with interested parties, including workers and\n            employers. As per the potential downturn in macroeconomic\n            stabilization, the project will complement the policy\n            actions supported by the International Monetary Fund, by\n            helping the authorities meet such targets."}, "docdt": "2001-11-20T00:00:00Z"}
