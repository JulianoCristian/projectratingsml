3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The main objectives of the project were: (a) to improve intercity roads and transports in the states
of Oyo and Osun and reduce transport costs through improving the condition of the state road
networks; (b) to improve organizational arrangements for better planning & management of the
state road system, including strengthening of the institutional capacity of the State Ministries of
Works and Transport (SMOWT); (c) to use contractors for road improvement and for a major
portion of road maintenance works; (d) to enhance resource mobilization and budgetary allocation
at the state level to ensure sustained maintenance of the road networks; and (e) to build technical
capacity at the state level to assess environmental impacts of road projects.
3.2 Revised Objective:
n.a.
3.3 Original Components:
Road Works ($96.1m): implementation of selected high priority road works in the States' five
year road investment program including rehabilitation and strengthening works, paving of selected
high volume unsurfaced roads and limited construction of new roads;
Vehicle and Equipment ($4.8m): purchase of vehicles and equipment to strengthen institutional
capacity to plan, design and supervise the project work;
Institutional Development ($12.4m); establishment of appropriate institutional arrangements
within the SMOWTs and support for planning, design, construction, maintenance and supervision
of roads, and for contract management.
Federal Component ($2.5m): technical assistance was to be provided to the Federal Ministry of
Works and Housing (FMWH) to prepare similar state road projects in other states, and for the
coordination of the on-going projects (this project and the First Multi-State Roads Project in
Kano and Jigawa States) and conducting environmental and other transport sector studies.
3.4 Revised Components:
Road Works: At the launching of the project it was found that the initial feasibility study for the
selection of road works was flawed (there were serious doubts about the reliability of the field
data collected) and not sufficiently prepared in collaboration with the State Authorities. It was
therefore decided to go ahead with the non controversial first year program for which detailed
design and bidding documents had been prepared. The balance of the investrnent was re-designed
with the technical assistance consultants in place and with a strong consultative process. The final
outcome is a network of rehabilitated roads of similar length as originally planned, however, is of
a more balanced nature in view of an integrated and economically useful road network.
Maintenance Component:  Originally it was planned that the States would be able to allocate
sufficient funding for the routine maintenance of the state road network. After a fivefold
devaluation of the Naira this was no longer possible. It was therefore decided to use part of the
counterpart funding available to the project (from at-source deduction and additional Petroleum
Trust Fund (PTF) funding) to execute a network wide routine maintenance program.
-2 -



Federal Component: Due to the deteriorating political and economic situatilon during project
implementation the set-up for the management of roads in Nigeria becamne unsuitable and
unsustainable. It became clear that the Bank would no longer support similar projects in the
future, without fundamental restructuring of road management and finance. Funds allocated
under this component were therefore utilized to support a private sector driven road management
reform initiative called Road Vision 2000 (RV2000) with the objective to fundamentally reform
road management and finance in Nigeria. In this framework, two studies were financed in support
of RV2000: (i) a Framework Study, outlining the features of the reform and producing a draft bill
for the introduction of a Roads Board and a Road Fund; and (ii) a Network Study assessing the
condition of the entire main road network in Nigeria (all roads with a traffic of more than 30
vehicles per day) and preparing a ten-year road maintenance and rehabilitation program. A further
component of RV2000, a concessioning pilot study on the Lagos to Ibadan Expressway, was
financed from the federal component of the First Multi-State Roads Project, which closed on June
30, 1998.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
In hindsight, one could judge that the project design was not very innovative regarding modem
approaches to road management and finance. However, it must be acknowledged that at the time
of project identification, the Nigerian economy and institutions were in a much better shape than
they are today, and that the political, economic and institutional decay that followed was not
foreseeable. The project took extensive lessons from the experiences made through our past
assistance in the road sector by adding a well designed institutional streng;thening component.
The feasibility study for the project was carried out by a well-known international consulting firm.
However, as mentioned in paragraph 3.4 above, the outcome of this study proved unsatisfactory.
Thanks to the capacity built up at the SMOWTs this initial weakness was overcome rapidly. In
view of the above, the performance of both the Borrower and the Bank in the
identification/preparation/appraisal of the project is judged as satisfactory.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The outcome of the project is judged as satisfactory. Improvements on the selected roads which
serve important agricultural production areas in the states, and which carry considerable traffic,
have achieved high economic rates of return. As a result of the competitive market in Nigeria and
adherence to Bank procurement procedures, construction costs were moderate and quality of
works satisfactory. The Highways Department of the Ministry of Works and Transport in each
state, has been considerably strengthened with the introduction of modern contract management,
maintenance and financial management systems. New procedures were developed for the
execution of routine and recurrent maintenance programs by contract (one man contracts and
contractors employed through the national competitive bidding procedures) and were successfully
implemented. Through the restructuring of the federal oversight component of the project a
national road management and finance reform  initiative was supported.  Meanwhile, the
Government has taken up on the proposals made in this reform and is planning to present a bill for
the creation of a National Road Board and Road Fund to the Parliament. Without adoption of this
reform, however, the long-term sustainability of the achievements of the project would not be
-3 -



assured.
4.2 Outputs by components:
Road Works
Under the project a total of 892 km of roads (as against the originally planned 994 km) were
constructed, rehabilitated or upgraded in 23 major contracts. This represents 26 percent of the
total state road network in Oyo and Osun States of 3493 km. One works contract concerned the
construction of an 8 kilometer 4-lane urban by pass road (Osogbo West By-pass). Unit per
kilometer costs were $625,000 equivalent (all unit cost without design and supervision). Three
contracts concerned the rehabilitation and partly widdening of 82 kilometers of exisiting paved
roads at a unit cost of $90,000 per kilometer equivalent. The balance of the contracts concerned
upgrading of exisiting earth or gravel roads to paved standard. A total of 802 kilometers were
upgraded at a unit per kilometer cost of $88,000 equivalent. The bulk of the roads were executed
to asphalt concrete (AC) standard (35 to 50 mm overlay) while 83 kilometers of lower volume
roads were built to double surface dressed (SD) standard. Roads with less than 500 vehicles per
day expected initial traffic were built to a width of 5.5 meters and 1.5 m shoulders. Roads with
higher traffic were built to the standard width of 7.3 meters and 2.5 meters shoulder. Quality of
the roads is satisfactory and costs are moderate to low, particularly when compared to costs in
neighboring countries. Average economic rate of return (ERR) of all the completed roads has
been calculated at 44 percent as against the initially estimated ERR of 43 percent.
All roads rehabilitation works were designed and supervised by qualified local consultants.
Thanks to the existence of a well developed engineering consulting industry in Nigeria, and
adherence to proper procurement procedures, most of the design and supervision services were of
satisfactory quality.
Road Maintenance
Amounts as specified in the project covenants were initially allocated in the annual budgets for
recurrent maintenance. However, these amounts were later (in 1994) not sufficiently adjusted to
inflation. In view of the general scarcity of resources at state level, it was agreed with
Government that the annual budget allocation for maintenance would be used for urgent repair
and maintenance of the urban roads, while project funding (the at-source deduction from the
federal account and later Petroleum (Special) Trust Fund (PTF) resources) would be used for
state road maintenance outside the city area. A five-year routine and recurrent maintenance
program was prepared by each SMOWT for the years 1996 to 2000, covering the entire state
road network. In Oyo and Osun States respectively, 104 and 95 maintenance contracts were
awarded during this period. The large majority of these contracts (of a duration between two
months and one year) have been implemented in time and the quality of works was generally
satisfactory. For long-term sustainability, a ten-year routine and periodic maintenance program for
the period 2000-2009 was prepared towards the end of the project. About Naira 488 million
Naira per annum is required for the maintenance of the state road network in Oyo State and 400
million Naira in Osun State. The state governments were advised to keep the at-source deduction
(Naira 10 million per month) dedicated to the maintenance of the state road network, which,
- 4 -



however, is still far short of requirement. In view of the scarcity of funds at state level, it is
doubtful that even this arrangement will hold, and without an overall reform oi road maintenance
management and finance in Nigeria, the achievements of the project are not sustlainable.
Institutional Development
In order to build institutional capacity within the SMOWTs and to assist the execution of the
project, each state signed a contract with an international consultant (STAC) to work in close
collaboration with the staff of the Highways Department and, in the process, lo transfer relevant
knowledge. In the course of their assignment these consultants provided 2:10 man-months of
technical assistance in each state. The staff of the Highways Department was intensively trained
on-the job, through STAC organized seminars and workshops, and in specialized local and
overseas training courses. A total of 466 man-months of training was provided of which 40%
abroad and 60%  in-country. The Highways Departments were effective in procuring and
managing the rehabilitation contracts, in planning and executing maintenance activities, quick
processing of interim payment certificates and in reporting and monitoring activities. However,
since the underlying weaknesses of the department as part of the government bureaucracy (such
as low salaries, lack of incentives, lack of funding for its activities, political interference) have not
been resolved, the survival of the enhanced capacity of the departments is doubifil.
Federal Component
The project was the second in a series of Multi-State Road Projects (MSRP) which were planned
to cover eventually all states of the country. The Federal Ministry of Works and Housing
(FMWH) was seen as the apex agency for these MSRPs. In order to support: the FMWH in its
coordination efforts, a Federal Technical Assistance Coordinator (FEDTAC) was employed under
the Federal Component of the project. When it became clear that after this project no further
similar projects would be financed by the Bank, this contract was terminated and the balance of
the funding under this component was utilized to support the Road Vision 2000 (RV2000)
Initiative (see chapter 3.4).
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
At appraisal an ERR of 53 percent for Oyo and 32 percent for Osun was calculated for all
investments. After project completion, an ERR of 36 percent was achieved for Oyo state and 53
percent for Osun state. Overall the actual ERR amounts to 44 percent as against the initially
assumed 43 percent (see Annex 3). These calculations assume that optimal mlaintenance will be
provided during the life span of the road (25 years). Assuming no or sub-oplimal maintenance,
the ERR would be substantially reduced, however, would remain above a threshold of 15 percent.
4.4 Financial rate ofreturn:
N/A
4.5 Institutional development impact:
As mentioned before, substantial capacity has been built up within the Departments of Highways
in the two States. However, the long term impact of the project could only be assured if the road
reform initiative would be successful in providing sustainable funding for maintenance, and, if,
through civil service reform and respective incentives, the trained staff in the State Highway
- 5 -



Departments can be kept.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Political Instability: The implementation period was marked by major political upheaval and
economic instability, which led to frequent change of government, undue interference into project
management and attempts to change the project framework. Despite of that unstable environment,
the project management units (the State Highway Departments in the two States) showed
remarkable resilience and good performance.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Availability of Petroleum Products: The failure of the government to restructure the petroleum
sector during most of the implementation period and its resistance to allow importation of
bitumen and fuel led to extended shortages of these products, causing serious delays in the
execution of the project. After the new democratically elected government took office, the
situation improved. However, the impact of the improvements were felt too late to avoid an
extension of the closing date of the project by six months (ten months for some selected
contracts).
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Despite the above, the staff of the Highway Departments and its Director remained, with some
interruptions, constant throughout the project which had a very positive impact on the execution
of the project. Furthermore, these staff were very able and committed professionals who
managed to successfully execute the project despite the political and economic disturbances faced
by the project.
5.4 Costs and financing:
At appraisal, total projects cost was estimated at $ 118.2 million, of which $ 58.6 million for Oyo,
$ 57.1 million for Osun, and $ 2.5 for the federal component. To the total, GON would contribute
$ 33.2 equivalent, and IDA $ 85 million. Actual expenditures were as follows: total expenditures
$ 116.3 million, of which Oyo $ 55.3 million, Osun $ 53.61 million, the federal component $ 2.23
million, and maintenance expenditure from government counterpart allocation $ 5.1 million
equivalent. The contribution of GON (through at-source deduction and Petrol (Special) Trust
Fund (PTF) allocation) was Naira 1858 million (or $ 31.7 million equivalent calculated at historic
exchange rates), while from the IDA credit an amount of $ 84.5 million was disbursed. With letter
of IDA dated November 15, 2000, the amount of SDR 62,186 was canceled from the credit,
being the undisbursed balance.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationalefor sustainability rating:
As mentioned earlier, short of a radical new approach to road management and financing, as
envisaged under the'Road Vision 2000 Initiative, the achievements of the project are unlikely to
be sustainable. Funding for maintenance is far short of requirement and the capacity built up at
the Departments of Highways will not be sustained unless fundamental improvements of civil
service conditions are achieved.
-6 -



Until recently, the new democratically elected government had not acted on the proposals made
under the Road Vision 2000 Initiative and was focusing on new construction atnd upgrading and
not on maintenance of existing roads. In December 2000, however, the Federal Minister of Works
and Housing presented the National Road Board Bill to the cabinet which plans to forward it to
the parliament for approbation in due course.  The bill has been prepared through a
private-sector-led participatory process. It was reviewed by a panel of international road fund
experts and found "top of the line", integrating world-wide experience made with road funds.
Care has to be taken that it will not be altered in any substantive way in the pclitical process. To
set up the National Road Board and its Secretariat and to get it operational, technical assistance
will be required.
Until the reform is implemented, the sustainability of the project is judged unlikely (UN).

7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
The Bank's preparation was done by an experienced team of professionals and with the help of
consultants. Lessons learnt from previous projects in the highway sector were integrated into the
project design. The political instability ensuing during the project implementation period could
not be foreseen. The Bank's lending performance is judged satisfactory.
7.2 Supervision:
The project was closely supervised in six monthly intervals and intermediate support was given by
a Bank staff in Nigeria. Experiences and knowledge from the Africa Road Maintenance Initiative
(RMI) was transfered to Nigeria and integrated in the Road Vision 2000 Initiative. It is
considered that the Bank supervision performance was satisfactory.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Overall Bank performance is judged satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Preparation of the project was done in close collaboration with the Bank and in great detail. The
borrower's preparation performance is judged satisfactory.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
Due to political turmoil, economic instability and frequent attempts to intervene into project
execution (mostly unsuccessful, due to a strong implementing agency, see paragraph 7.6), the
government performance is judged unsatisfactory.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
Despite of the above, and due to the presence of committed staff, the implementing agencies
performed remarkably well, and its performance is judged satisfactory.
- 7 -



7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Overall Borrower performance is judged satisfactory
8. Lessons Learned
The following main lessons can be drawn from the implementation of this project for possible
future operations in the road sector:
*     Nigeria is blessed with a strong private sector, including numerous experienced highly
capable road contractors and engineering consultants. Through the strict application of the Bank's
procurement procedures, particularly pre-qualification based on appropriate criteria and
short-listing, unqualified firms can be weeded out and quality and moderately priced works and
services can be achieved.
*     Through adequate incentives, including the provision of training, motivated project
management units can be created to execute projects. However, their long-term survival, within
the current civil service structure, is doubtful, without a successful civil service reform program.
*     The current set-up for the management and financing of roads in Nigeria is not viable.
Any future engagement of the Bank in the road sector in Nigeria should only be considered after
the successful implementation of the reforms proposed under the Road Vision 2000 Initiative,
which are: (i) the creation of an independant National Roads Board (NRB), with a majority of
private sector representatives on its Board; (ii) setting-up of a Road Fund managed by NRB; and
(iii) management of area road networks (including federal, state and local government roads,
within one state, or a group of states) through private sector road management companies.
