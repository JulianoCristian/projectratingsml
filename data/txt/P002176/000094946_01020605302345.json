Short of a radical new approach to road\n            management and financing, the achievements of the project\n            are unlikely to be sustainable. Overall World Bank and\n            Borrower performances are judged satisfactory. These lessons\n            may be drawn for implementing future road sector projects:\n            Through the strict application of the Bank's\n            procurement procedures, particularly pre-qualification based\n            on appropriate criteria and short-listing, unqualified firms\n            can be weeded out, and quality and moderately priced works\n            and services can be achieved. Through adequate incentives,\n            including the provision of training, motivated project\n            management units can be created to execute projects.\n            However, their long-term survival, within the current civil\n            service structure, is doubtful, without a successful civil\n            service reform program. The current set-up for the\n            management and financing of roads in Nigeria is not viable.\n            Any future engagement of the Bank in this country's\n            road sector should only be considered after successfully\n            implementing these reforms: creating an independent National\n            Roads Board with a majority of private sector\n            representatives on the board; setting up a Road Fund managed\n            by NRB; and managing area road networks through private\n            sector road management companies."}, "docdt": "2000-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
