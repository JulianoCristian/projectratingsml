Nevertheless,\n            the performance of the Bank was marginally satisfactory, for\n            although considerable flexibility was given during\n            implementation, supervision was negligent due to the lack of\n            appropriate procurement planning, and transparency in the\n            selection process. Similarly, the performance of the\n            Borrower gave mixed results, particularly, due to the\n            untimely release of counterpart funds, and, delays during\n            implementation because of late budgetary, and project\n            approvals. The lessons convey primarily, the importance of\n            beneficiary participation in both the design, and\n            implementation stages of projects, to enhance project\n            ownership, and increase loan repayment. This flexibility\n            allows the inclusion of beneficiaries' suggestions, -\n            as in this case - on appropriate usage, and location of\n            pumps, which proved successful for water availability.\n            Private sector involvement can greatly improve project\n            sustainability, as will, that from non-governmental\n            organizations, and local governments, if agreed early on,\n            ensuring greater commitment. It is further suggested, that\n            project design should consider downstream linkages, such as\n            storage, processing and marketing of agricultural products,\n            much more comprehensively, to attain the agricultural\n            development expected."}, "docdt": "2000-01-27T00:00:00Z"}
