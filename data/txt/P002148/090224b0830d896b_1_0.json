Increased focus\n            on generating community feedback in the Nigeria Fadama\n            project, funded by the World Bank, is helping to improve\n            rural livelihoods by deepening the quality and quantity of\n            communication between development practitioners,\n            governments, and community members. The farmers have\n            struggled in the face of grinding poverty and livelihoods\n            have been undercut by low agricultural yields. The project\n            has developed a vibrant network of inclusive community\n            networks. It has also launched a promising mobile phone and\n            SMS-based system that will allow beneficiaries to provide\n            feedback on a variety of indicators from the performance of\n            project staff to suggestions on how to improve the timing of\n            funds disbursement. It is currently operating in all the 36\n            states of Nigeria including the Federal Capital Territory.\n            The World Bank has also provided technical assistance,\n            drawing upon its experience with community driven\n            development approaches in other countries. Fadama project\n            has built strong networks of community associations and user\n            groups and piloting of an SMS network should be seen as a\n            starting point for a system of feedback mechanisms that can\n            provide both more quantitative and more qualitative\n            information on project implementation."}, "docdt": "2012-11-01T05:48:01Z"}
