"The project will construct about 50,000\n            shallow tubewells in Bauchi, Jigawa, Kano, Kebbi, Sokoto and\n            other eligible states over a period of four years.  The\n            maximum irrigation potential will be 100,000 ha, but in\n            practice it is unlikely that this potential will be fully\n            realized, and a conservative assumption of 50,000 ha of\n            irrigation cropping has been used for calculating the\n            project benefits.  In addition to providing for new\n            irrigation, the project will:  (a) privatize drilling; (b)\n            construct fadama and access roads and marketing\n            infrastructure; (c) simplify drilling technology for shallow\n            tubewells, conduct aquifer studies and upgrade irrigation\n            technologies; (d) organize fadama farmers for irrigation\n            management, cost recovery and better access to credit,\n            marketing and other services; and (e) complete a full\n            environmental assessment of future fadama development."}, "docdt": "1992-02-04T00:00:00Z"}
