The two main project components will: 1) establish,\n            retrofit, and equip the main Global Development Learning\n            Network (GDLN) center at the University of Indonesia's\n            Salemba campus, and three selected sub-centers at the\n            Universities of Hasanuddin, Riau, and Udayana. The main GDLN\n            center will include two technology-based classrooms\n            connected to GDLN Washington through multimedia facilities\n            for video, data, and voice exchange, including the supply of\n            computers, pedagogical tools, and internet access. The three\n            sub-centers will be retrofitted, and partially equipped to\n            include one multimedia classroom; and, 2) finance operation\n            costs on a decreasing basis, over the four-year\n            implementation, technical assistance, and training for\n            distance learning centers' staff, as well as periodic\n            evaluations of operations, and management, and the\n            establishment of financial accounts and, annual auditing.\n            Funds will be available for sponsoring, and developing the\n            content for local courses, and partnerships, in addition to\n            financing technology reviews, and upgrade."}, "docdt": "2002-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
