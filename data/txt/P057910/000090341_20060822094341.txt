3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:
The objective of the project was to prepare the Brazilian states technically to address pension reform and
help them to move through the initial phases of reform. It was also to assist the Federal and State
Governments to choose from among the best options and encourage them to implement sound reform.
There was a further, implicit objective -- to build a constituency for reform. The project is a Learning and
Innovation Loan (LIL), designed under the old format, which is to say it was intended to be flexible and to
help participants explore and develop solutions to specific problems, or build the capacity to develop them.


In 1999, when the PARSEP project began, the fiscal situation of most Brazilian states was precarious. As
of December 1997, state and local debt was 13 percent of GDP and 38 percent of all government debt.
Pension obligations constituted a large and growing component of state debt, consuming 30-50 percent of
revenues in some states.      The gravity of the situation was also indicated by the ratio of pension
expenditures to current salary bill in the public sector ­ which in the states of Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro,
and Rio Grande do Sul ranged from 50 to 120 percent.

While the need to address these problems at all levels of government was clear, there were several
complicating factors. First, during the 1990s, the number of pension programs for public workers had
proliferated at the state (and municipal) level, but without adequate financing or provisions to manage
contributions productively. Second, and as a result, many states managed their multiple systems on a cash
flow basis, using their income from contributions to make current pension payments, and whatever
remained for other current expenditures.        Third, none had in operation any mechanisms (actuarial
techniques or even an adequate cadastre of actual and potential beneficiaries) for estimating contingent
liabilities over the longer run. Fourth, those running the programs for the most part lacked any special
training in pension fund management; their duties were usually limited to collecting contributions and
calculating and paying benefits. Fifth, state pensions were constitutionally a state attribution and the
Federal Government thus had no obligations or rights regarding state pension reform.

Moreover, the Constitution of 1988 had increased the guarantees and lowered restrictions as regards
pension rights thereby augmenting the demands on the systems and reducing the room for making changes.
This created enormous resistance among potential beneficiaries to anything they interpreted as threatening
their acquired rights; Fernando Henrique Cardoso's unsuccessful efforts during his first term to introduce
basic reforms suggested just how potent this resistance could be.

The solution for what was and remains perhaps the most important macroeconomic issue facing the
Brazilian Federal and state governments was not sought only in this project. As the LIL was being
prepared, the government was making another attempt at reform (approved via Constitutional Amendment
in December, 1998) to a) introduce principles of actuarial and fiscal balance into private and public sector
workers' pension systems; b) eliminate certain special benefit rules and regimes, put a benefit ceiling on
RGPS (state managed pensions for private sector workers) indexed to inflation, set a minimum retirement
age for the RPPS (civil service pensions), and establish a minimum vesting period of 10 years to receive
higher RPPS benefits; and c) enable states and municipalities to create complementary pension funds.
Taking advantage of the Brazilian initiatives to address the larger problem, the WB prepared a package of
operations. In addition to PARSEP, these included a S/SECAL of $757.57 million (approved December,
1998); a second LIL for technical assistance in effecting the constitutional changes within the INSS (the
entity managing the RGPS); and a PHRD grant to prepare a second Social Security S/SECAL. Given this
package of assistance, additional support from the IDB, and the Government's own efforts, attributing

effects is complicated. Nonetheless, the PARSEP experience was instrumental in driving further advances.
The model and software it developed were used and further refined in PREV-MUN (signed in 2003) and
the IDB's PROPREV, and have spawned the follow-on project, PARSEP II. Furthermore, as discussed
below, PARSEP contributed in generating the conditions for further national-level reforms and also to the
drafting of additional legislation.

3.2 Revised Objective:
Project objectives were not revised over the period. However, some additional PDOs (and intermediate
objectives) were added and the targets for the initial PDOs were upgraded to higher levels. These
developments reflected the counterpart and the Bank's evolving understanding both of the challenges and
potential for change and for the most part involved setting more ambitious goals ­ e.g. the creation of a new
software, the establishment of permanent entities within the MPAS/MPS to oversee subnational programs,
and the revision of national, as opposed to state, laws.

3.3 Original Components:
The project was organized both in phases and components. As the project was prepared in an era when the
Bank was less insistent on a uniform design format, the original documentation is somewhat inconsistent on
the components, which appear in two versions in the PAD and still a third version in the loan agreement.
However, whether distributed among phases, parts, or components, the basic activities are the same. The
format used here is the first version appearing in the PAD. The only significant change over the life of the
project was the addition of some activities, all of which are consistent with the general objective and simply
reflect the Bank and borrower's improved understanding of the situation. It was expected that at least 15
of Brazil's 26 states (plus the Federal District) would complete Project Phases 1 and 2, and that Phase 3
would be completed on an exceptional basis. The phases and their components were as follows:

Phase I: Diagnostic. Actually more than a diagnostic, this phase aimed at providing the states with the
structural and technical tools to understand their current situations and begin the development of reform
proposals. It included the following components:

    a. Development of cleaned sample databases of active and retired employees at the state level so as to
    provide actuarial data for pension modeling

    b. Training of two officials per state in pension reform and pension modeling making use of the Bank's
    PROST software

    c. Diagnostic of current and future pension obligations and financial implications in each state using
    PROST or other simulation models

    d. Dissemination by states of results and debates in open forums

    e. Strengthening of state pension units with appropriate mandates, trained personnel, budget, hardware
    and software to manage pension reforms

    f. Development of technical unit (TU) within the federal pension ministry (MPAS, later MPS) with a
    legal mandate and appropriate resources (including trained staff) to assist the states and the Ministry of
    Finance in implementing the project and monitoring through shared data the evolution of state reforms.

Phase 2: Reform Proposals




                                                     - 3 -

     a. States develop reform proposals using PROST and other simulation models vetted by the TU

     b. Dissemination by states and debate of results in open forums.

Phase 3: Institutional Framework

     a. A few states design the legislative and institutional framework necessary to implement pension
     reform

     b. States disseminate and debate results in open forums

Phase 4: Government strengthening.                 ­ This phase was intended to support State and Federal reform
through studies in 3 crucial areas:

     a. Complementary legislation to implement the constitutional reforms
     b. Best practices for pension fund management
     c. Federal INSS pension related financial obligations to states and state obligations to INSS

A fourth WB independent study of critical pension issues was to be done during the first year of the project.
This study would use the experience of other countries and Brazil's own experience to identify relevant
lessons, and would also discuss what needed to be done for state reforms to be consistent with broader
reforms of the social security system.

3.4 Revised Components:
Because this was a LIL, and because of the various factors impeding its rapid start-up, the project design
did vary over the life of project.              Most notable among these variations were the substitution of
"recadastramentos"       [1] of the entire executive branch (as opposed to the initial 15 percent samples) in
seventeen states and the creation of a new pension management software as major activities. Additionally,
the development of a management unit within the MPAS (now MPS) took on much greater importance and
produced far more significant results than initially envisioned. This poses a challenge for the evaluators,
which has been addressed by using the initial project design, but noting where additions and changes in
emphasis were made. The bottom line, however, is that it was these changes that made the project so
successful. Had it followed its initial design to the letter, it would have produced far less and had far fewer
significant impacts.


3.5 Quality at Entry:
Quality at entry was rated Excellent and the Project was recognized as one of 10 QAE distinguished loans
for that period. In 2000 it also received a "Social Development Award" for Excellence in Project Quality
in 2000 and a CMU Performance Award was given to the Social Security team for "high quality analytic,
technical and financial support to the Brazilian program of social security reform at both the Federal and
State levels." PARSEP was showcased for its results in 2004 as "a catalyst for Brazilian Pension
Reform."

    There is no good English equivalent for the term "recadastre" (recadastramento in Portuguese) is used to denote the process
of vetting the lists of active and pensioned employees to eliminate redundancies, errors and fraud.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Despite the obstacles and challenges faced by the project, it far surpassed its initial objectives and its rating
is highly satisfactory. The objectives (and components), however, went through some further interpretation
and upgrading in the course of the 7 years, as did the indicators for their success. At the time the project
initiated, Brazil was only beginning its pension reforms and no one really understood the full mix of factors
contributing to any solution. The initial project plan underestimated the states' potential interest in the new
techniques and tools it introduced as well as the importance of and possibility for effecting further changes
in federal as opposed to state legislation in advancing reform. It also overestimated the appropriateness of
the software program (PROST) it proposed to use for the program. Finally, unknown and thus not
considered in the design stage, was the role of project activities in effecting immediate savings by detecting
fraud and overpayments in existing pension systems, as well as the importance this would have in
encouraging states to join the program. When one of the early samples uncovered sufficient errors and
fraud to allow several million dollars of annual savings, the MPS counterparts and the TTL recognized that
expanding the vetting to the entire executive branch cadastres would be important in building a
constituency in the states and building interest in the project.

The initial formal objective was in two parts: to prepare the states technically to address the issue of
pension reform and to help them through the early stages, and to help the State and Federal Governments
choose from among the best options and encourage them to implement sound reforms. As noted, there was
a third, implicit objective of constituency building. On the state side, the goal was to establish adequately
resourced pension units, train 2 officials in each state, and diagnose and disseminate information on the
current situation and on reform proposals. The units already existed, but the project has supported their
equipment and training and encouraged their more adequate staffing. In addition it has contributed to
national-level legislation (not envisioned in the initial plan) to create a unified administrator for all civil
service pension systems (all branches and units of state government). States did make additional changes
along the way, in some cases anticipating parts of the 2003 constitutional amendment (as regards
increasing contributions from employees and employing agencies) and adding provisions for investment of
contributions (thus ending the cash flow management style). However, given that so much of the system
was constitutionally mandated, the potential for individual state reforms proved to be more limited than
initially envisioned.

 Training was to be in PROST, a pension management software developed by the Bank. PROST was
 found to be inadequate to Brazilian needs. It did not drill down to the individual account level and
 moreover was a proprietary software developed by Bank staff, a situation which caused some friction
 when the Brazilians showed an interest in making their own changes to it. The project, thus sponsored the
 development of (and training in) a substitute system, SIPREV, which is now being adopted nationally.
 SIPREV's comprehensive electronic database (modeled in part on PROST) and actuarial modules were
 instrumental to PARSEP's advances. A payroll and benefits module is currently under development with
 the assistance of other loans. Two other unanticipated developments were the creation of CRP, a website
 managed by the MPS and posting state legislation and actuarial analysis and evaluating its adequacy, and
 of CONAPREV, a national association of pension officials which has assumed an important advisory and
 educational role.    The latter drew on a model already existing in other ministries which sponsor
 associations of state secretaries.

On the federal side, the major aim was to create a technical unit (TU) within the MPAS (later MPS) to
assist the states and the Ministry of Finance in implementing the project and monitoring through shared

data, the evolution of state pensions. Again the initial goal was far surpassed. The implementation team
(UEP) has "metamorphosed into a fully staffed ministerial department (Department of Public Social
Security Systems, DRPSP) with a (new) constitutional mandate to monitor and evaluate sub-national RPPS
systems". (World Bank, 2006, p. 34). The Secretaria de Prevedência Social, within which it sits, has also
evolved into a much stronger body, responsible for overseeing all RPPS programs. Over the course of the
project, and helped by inputs it and its Brazilian team have provided, the principle that the federal
government oversees all sub-national programs is now firmly established, in law and in the organizational
structure.

On both the state and federal side, the aim had been to study and develop recommendations for system
reform. The results have gone far beyond this to help produce a second constitutional reform (in 2003)
which made several across the board changes to the RPPS, as shown in box 1 below:


 Box 1: Main Components of the December 2003 Reform to the RPPS World Bank (2006), p. 23.

 1) Stricter Rules for Retirement in the Public Sector. The introduction of penalties ranging from 3.5
 to 5 percent of the wage base for each year of retirement prior to the normal retirement age of 60 for men
 and 55 for women; the abolition of proportional retirement provisions for those who did not have the
 right to retire from this program before the reform; the increase in the required years of service in the
 public sector from 10 to 20 years, and in the last position from 5 to 10 years.
 2) New Benefit Formula. The change of the pension base, from the last wage to the average of 80
 percent of the highest real wages after 1994;
 3) New Indexation Rule. The switch from wage to price indexation of benefits;
 4) Rules on Acquired Rights. Measures (1)-(3) do not apply to workers who had already acquired the
 right to retire, under the old rules. Measures (2)-(3) do not apply to workers who meet the new stricter
 conditions for retirement described in (1).
 5) Survivor Pensions. A reduction in survivor's pensions--from 100 percent of the original pension to 70
 percent above a threshold of 2,400 Reais per month;
 6) Imposition of Contributions/Tax on RPPS Pensioners. The introduction of a contribution rate of 11
 percent for pensioners, on the benefit portion above the threshold of 2,400 Reais per month;
 7) Imposition of Benefit Ceiling for RPPS combined with Creation of Complementary Pension
 Funds. The introduction of a benefit/contribution ceiling, equal to the respective ceiling in the RGPS,
 provided that the employer (the federal, state, or municipal Government) creates a complementary
 defined contribution pension fund;
 8) Overall Wage and Benefit Caps. Maximum wage and benefit levels were introduced, and defined by
 the salary of the respective leaders of the executive, judicial and legislative branches of the federal and
 subnational governments;
 9) Minimum Subnational Contribution. The introduction of a minimum contribution of 11 percent for
 all active state and municipal civil servants;
10) RGPS Ceiling. The RGPS (and thus RPPS) contribution/benefit ceiling was raised to 2,400 Reais per
month.


Other legal reforms of particular importance include setting the mandate of the federal MPS to oversee the
RPPS and enforce compliance with new RPPS legislation, including legal frameworks, actuarial analyses,
reporting, and most recently the clean up of pension data bases and the adoption of SIDARP (as the current
version of SIPREV is now called). While the results cannot be attributed entirely to PARSEP, and affect
more than the states' employees, the information amassed through the project was instrumental in
promoting the reform and its eventual passage. SPS staff working with PARSEP also helped draft
legislation leading to and building on these amendments. The consequences of the 2003 constitutional
amendment should have an important impact on state pension pay-outs, and pave the way for further

reforms of the systems.

4.2 Outputs by components:
Phase/Component 1

a)       States develop a sample data base of 15 percent of active and retired state employees sufficient
to extract actuarial data for pension modeling

Highly Satisfactory. This became one of the most successful and most critical elements of the project. It
was originally believed that 15 states would create cleaned partial samples as a basis for future modeling.
Instead 17 states have completed or contracted full recadastres and 24 in total undertook some kind of
exercise.   Because of legal limitations and their own resistance, the databases of other branches of
government could not be included in most cases (judiciary and legislature, in total not comprising a
significant percentage of all state employees, although because of their high pensions, representing
significant costs and possibly significant savings). However, the 2003 constitutional amendment through
its creation of a single administrator has changed that situation, and the addition of the other branches will
be covered under PARSEP II. Nonetheless, the recadastres produced an additional enormous benefit and
one contributing to the popularity of the program ­ the savings generated by identifying fraud,
overpayment, or other intentional or unintentional error. This was not a result anticipated in the project
documentation, although interviews with project staff suggest they saw this as a further consequence of the
sampling exercise.

The results above are only for nine states and for the most part only for the executive branch, but they still
total over US $100 million of potential annual savings. While fraud and overpayment are hardly the
greatest problem posed by the current pension system, the opportunity for making these immediate savings
has enhanced the program's popularity among other states and at the municipal level.          The recadastres
have allowed cross-checking with other databases to capture still more fraud, and their results now feed
into a central system managed by the SPS. They also pave the way for component C below, the actuarial
studies to determine future liabilities without change to the current system.

b)         Training of 2 officials per state in pension reform and modeling via "PROST"

Highly Satisfactory. Here again the project took an unexpected turn, with the substitution of a new,
project-funded pension system management software, SIPREV which is being expanded into a
multi-module system for managing the all pension programs. A decree is expected to be enacted which will
mandate SIPREV's (now called SIDARP) use in all subnational governments. Aside from the development
of SIPREV and its adoption in 20 states, there have been 19 training programs in its use, and 5 multi-state
workshops, the latter with a total of 590 participants. The project also supported multiple training
activities in the principles of pension system management and the publication of related texts. These
activities began as early as 1999, although they have picked up speed in the last few years.

c)         States produce a diagnostic of current and future pension obligations via PROST or other
simulation models

Highly Satisfactory. As a consequence of the 1998 constitutional amendment, actuarial analyses were
legally required at the time of project effectiveness. However, virtually no state had the capacity to do one
and there was no means of forcing compliance (because of the states' independence). The few that tried
produced very poor results. The focus on recadastramentos (as opposed to the sample surveys) doubtless
slowed the process, but, once it was begun, generated more faith in the results. The strategy was to help
the states conduct a first study, and then on that basis have them continue on their own later. So far studies
have been completed in 20 states with a few more pending. Most were done in 2004 and 2005. The
creation of a website managed by the MPS on which the results of the actuarial studies are posted provides
an additional impetus for continuing the practice, as do the MPS's new legal authority to oversee, vet and
provide technical assistance to the subnational programs and the provision for a cut-off in federal funding
for state noncompliance.

d)         States disseminate and debate results in open forums

Satisfactory. As documented in the reports from the PCU, the states have held numerous forums on
pension management both for system managers and affected workers. Through the project they have also
been provided published materials to back up the discussions. However, wider discussions of the actuarial
results have been delayed because of the slow start of this component.              Nonetheless, following the
completion of each study, the MPS auditors met with state officials to debate findings, leading in some

cases to the states' decision to increase taxes and contribution rates. The savings from the recadastres have
been publicized, creating other sources of support for the undertaking. If the purpose was the creation of
recognition of the need for change, it was fully met. However, given the expectation that the discussions
would draw more fully on the actuarial results, the rating is only satisfactory.

e)       "MPAS" develops a technical unit with a legal mandate and appropriate resources to assist
states and MF in implementing the project.

Highly Satisfactory.     This is another of the dramatic successes of the program, far surpassing the initial
expectations. Once the project coordination responsibility was removed from Finance Ministry, and in
some sense even before, those units in the MPS responsible for the oversight of pension projects were
transformed into the Secretaria de Prevedência Social (SPS) and the Department of Public Social Security
Systems (DRPSP) and given the legal mandate to oversee all RPPS (including those of subnational
entities). The SPS, considered by Bank specialists to be a unique institution in the region, received project
support for consultants, logistics, training, IT, publications, and related expenses.        Both the Project
Coordinating Unit (PCU), which reports to the MPS' Executive Secretary and manages all its
IFI-sponsored projects, and the Project Executing Unit (PEU) located in the SPS and responsible for the
technical execution of PARSEP, have also received support, and the latter in particular has been
responsible for such innovations as the development of SIPREV, the CRP system, and CONAPREV, as
well as input into the drafting of new legislation. With PARSEP support, the MPS also created the
National Council of State RPPS Directors (CONAPREV) which has assumed an increasingly important
consultative role representing state views on proposed reforms. In short, rather than limiting itself to the
development of a project-dedicated technical unit, PARSEP has contributed to the formation of a series of
permanent organizations within the MPS legally responsible for overseeing the entire RPPS and thus
destined to last beyond the project's life.

Phase/Component 2

States Develop Reform Proposals Using PROST and any Other Simulation Models Vetted by the TU

Satisfactory. As noted, the potential for reform at the state level was limited by the constitutional status of
the programs. State reform has instead gone in the direction of strengthening their pension management
units, creation of arrangements to invest contributions, and use of the recadastres and cross-checking with
other data bases to detect fraud. Still state participation in the project has increased openness to the further
constitutional and national level legal reforms which in the end will reshape their own programs. In the
end, this phase or component is really a part of the following item, which does get a higher grade.

Phase/Component 3

A few States on an Exceptional Basis, Design the Legislation and Institutional Framework Necessary to
Implement Pension Reforms

Highly Satisfactory. This can be considered a legitimately modified component. Once it became apparent
that state systems were limited as to the changes they could introduce on their own and that further legal
and constitutional modifications were instead required at the national level, project efforts shifted in this
direction. The results included a constitutional amendment, as outlined in Box 1 above, which changed
some of the basic rules governing pension systems in all states. The results have been far more important
than a state-by-state approach would ever have produced. However, work with the states in the preceding
activities clearly fed into the development of the final national-level changes.

Phase/Component 4

"Government Strengthening"

Satisfactory. Governance strengthening was highly satisfactory as indicated in the above ratings. However
this component anticipated something else ­ the execution and discussion of a series of studies as an
educational tool. The studies were done and numerous workshops and publications produced as a result.
However, their contribution to the overall progress of the project may have been less than the lessons
learned from the other activities. This is not a design or implementation fault. Had the counterparts
adopted the activities less enthusiastically, the studies might have played a larger role. As it turned out,
their impact was overtaken by events ­ and the events produced far more than had been anticipated.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
This was a remarkably cheap project with a remarkably large impact. However, many other actions were
occurring simultaneously so that attribution of all potential impacts is difficult. Like the financial returns
(see 4.4 below) these are not immediately calculable, because they will accrue from the project's
contributions to further reforms in Brazil's pension system. So far most attention has focused on on-going
fraud. The next step is a more serious consideration of the actuarial studies, their implications for
contingent debt, and the introduction of measures to curb the effects. This is intrinsically a longer term and
highly politicized process. However, changes introduced in the 2003 Constitutional Amendment are an
important first step as is earlier legislation that established the MPS's right to oversee and vet state pension
systems. Better information on actual and future pay-outs, assuming a continuation of the current system,
may not be sufficient to overcome the many vested interests, but they are an important tool in doing this.
As the new software (SIPREV) also allows drilling down to individual cases, a second and more potent
form of analysis might focus on the intrinsic inequalities of the current system ­ how much of the public
budget is paying the pension of what percentage of the population and how this is distributed among the
beneficiaries. None of this would have been possible without the changes introduced by PARSEP and thus
the project has contributed to advancing a still uncalculable improvement in public finances and the
opening of fiscal space.

4.4 Financial rate of return:
The project has offered immediate financial gains to the participating provinces. The most obvious and
least contestable results are the savings made available through purging of the pension cadastres and the
identification and elimination of fraudulent and erroneous payments. Early results from 9 states showed
potential savings (assuming agencies act on the findings) of US $100 million annually.                 Once all
recadastres are completed it is anticipated that the savings should be at least double, and once the other
branches of government are added (fewer pensions, but among the largest) savings should be even greater.
Moreover, the linkage of the state databases in the SPS will also allow identification of fraud and illegal
payments that extend across states ­ individuals collecting excessive amounts or excessive numbers of
pensions in several jurisdictions. Against an initial investment of $5 million, this is already an enormous
return.

4.5 Institutional development impact:
As detailed throughout the text, the project's institutional development goals have been more than fully met.
State pension units have had their internal capacity strengthened, their staff trained in pension management,
and their technical resources upgraded. The new units in the MPS are now fully charged with overseeing
development of all government pensions included in the RPPS and have the capacity to do this. The
creation of the CRP and CONAPREV support these institutional changes and their sustainability over time.



                                                       - 10 -

Moreover the institutional environment; as regards a broader understanding of the workings and challenges
of pension management has also been altered for the better. All of this was incorporated in the project's
initial goals, but the results have far surpassed those initially predicted.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:

Two factors were critical in affecting implementation. The first was the limited knowledge, on the part of
the Bank or the borrower, as to the situation of the pension systems at the state level. Had this project only
developed that information it might have been worth the money invested. It is possible, but not verifiable
from the project documentation, that the changes initially envisioned were more of a policy than
organizational nature.         However, over the early years it became apparent that basic organizational
strengthening, at both the federal and state level, would be a necessary prelude to policy change. The
strides made in the former area are enormous, but in some sense not predicted given the lack of clarity as to
the starting point. This is not the fault of either participant, and it is to their credit that they took up the

better defined challenge and pursued it as far as they did. If Brazil today is in a better position to evaluate
more basic policy changes, and has already enacted a second constitutional amendment to impose more
order on the system, then PARSEP (I), the rest of the donor package, and the Brazilian reformers can take
the collective credit.

The second factor has to do with various aspects of implementation arrangements and changes in the
responsible authorities. As first designed, PARSEP was to be managed out of the Ministry of Finance,
through a PCU already implementing the huge IDB PNAFE loans. It is not clear how this decision
emerged and whether it was promoted by the Bank, the government, or both. These arrangements prevailed
for the first years despite the fact that it was the MPAS/MPS that designed the loan and did the operational
work. The results were not positive; the MPS did all the procurement, but then encountered delays in
Finance, due in part to a greater interest in the IDB project. One year the PCU even budgeted incorrectly,
attributing PARSEP to IDB. It cost about 8 months to straighten that out and get the money flowing again.
Finally, in 2001 the MF handed the loan over to MPS, but the transfer took another 6-8 months. Once it
was affected, the project implementation speeded up considerably as shown in the reports on disbursements
and activities undertaken.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
There was a further problem posed by changes in ministerial and lower level leadership, both in Finance
and in the MPS. The team in Finance was constantly changing and their attention was inevitably directed
to the larger IDB project. The MPS went through at least four changes in Minister, five Executive
Secretaries, and 5 PCU heads during the life of project. Other key staff remained longer, but turnover at
other levels contributed to delays.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
These were only positive. Technical leaders who remained within the implementing agency despite the
frequent changes of other personnel began with a vision of what they wanted to achieve and were able to
push it forward successfully. To a certain extent, additional objectives not included in the initial project
documentation were identified by, these leaders. One example is the shift from cleansing of partial samples
to entire cadastres. An initial sample done in Parana (when the project was under preparation) indicated
the enormous savings possible through identifying and eliminating fraudulent and erroneous payments.
While it was believed this would be a strong selling point for attracting state participation as well as
involving states in full purges of their registries, it was recognized that it could simultaneously increase
resistance from those benefiting from the errors.

5.4 Costs and financing:
These did not affect implementation. The project achieved an enormous amount for the financing available
and despite the addition of new activities, was able to do this within the amounts allocated.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
The changes introduced by the project are now well entrenched by constitutional and legal provisions and
by new organizational structures and capabilities. Activities undertaken (e.g. the actuarial studies) have
also increased understanding of the risks posed by the existing pension system and thus the need for further
policy change. Some of those changes are already included in the 2003 Constitutional Amendment and
others are under study. It would be difficult to imagine any reason for reversals ­ the remaining question is
simply how fast additional changes, leveraged by the project and related undertakings, will proceed. The
improvements in pension management introduced under PARSEP are solid, and represent part of what the
TTL calls a "revolution" in Brazil's approach to its pension systems. This is arguably one of the most

sustainable operations the Bank has introduced.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Activities begun under PARSEP are to be continued under PARSEP II. They include both the extension of
the recadastramentos, software, and actuarial techniques to states (and branches of government) not
covered under the first operation, and the development and institutionalization of innovations like the
unified pension administrator. Once accomplished, these further additions should allow the system to
continue on its own, operating at a far higher level of efficiency. Further, more basic changes to the
pension systems may require support from DPLs or similar operations, but the organizational arrangements
promoted under PARSEP and continued under PARSEP II should require no further IFI support.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:
This is a difficult call, largely because it is never clear how to assess performance under unexpectedly
difficult conditions.

The selection of this area for a lending operation was prescient at least ­ the Bank was attuned to the
changing situation as regards pensions and quickly scaled up several operations to respond to it. Given the
lack of information on the state situation, the use of an old-form LIL was also ideal; it would have been
much less productive to select a more structured and rigid approach.                The initial implementation
arrangements agreed on by both parties were probably not optimal, although they may have appeared so at
project initiation. The shift to full MPS responsibility was timely, although the delays were unfortunate.
Likewise, the decision to extend the project was also very wise ­ at the point it was taken, it was evident
implementation was picking up and that ending the project in accord with its original timeline would have
lost an opportunity for much more impact. The Bank also showed good judgment in giving the three
pension LILs to the same TTL ­ at the very least this allowed for economies of scale in supervision, and it
also allowed for many internal synergies. Satisfactory

7.2 Supervision:
Supervision was excellent. The TTL had a good relationship with the counterpart, but also could get tough
when things slowed down. While the evaluators could not find a complete set of early BTORs and Project
Status reports in the files, they are willing to blame this on the shift from paper to electronic format. (Some
documents were apparently misfiled in IRIS as evidenced by the lengthy search for the loan agreement.)
Since 2001 the files are complete and provide a good history of developments. Moreover, the TTL's
enthusiasm about and knowledge of the project is probably one of the best proofs of the quality of
supervision. Highly Satisfactory.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:
This is given a satisfactory because of the delays and initial "errors" in implementation arrangements.
However, this was a hard call given the overall excellent returns despite the various obstacles, many of
which were outside the control of any of the immediate parties. The evaluators were tempted to give a
"highly satisfactory" for a project that produced far beyond what was anticipated in the face of not always
favorable circumstances. Perhaps the Bank needs to clarify its criteria to avoid the risk of encouraging less
daring and less innovative approaches.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Little detailed information was available on this point given the time that has passed since the project was



                                                      - 15 -

designed. However, on the basis of what was provided and the project's subsequent performance,
preparation is assessed as satisfactory. The project responded to a clear interest on the part of the
government in improving the management of state pensions systems, targeted the areas in which reform
was required, and identified, in consultation with the counterparts, a series of activities likely to accomplish
those ends. Although some of those activities underwent some subsequent modifications, the use of a LIL
allowed this to happen.

7.5 Government implementation performance:
Pension reform was a priority on the government's agenda when the project began and remained one over
its existence. This was particularly important as regards support for new legislation and constitutional
amendments which strengthened the powers of the MPS and thus enhanced project performance. The
initial problems under Finance's control are the only reason for lowering the rating; however, we would still
keep it at satisfactory.

7.6 Implementing Agency:
This is satisfactory, an average of the lower grade under Finance's direction and the higher one under the
MPS. Clearly a mistake was made in initially assigning the project to the PCU in Finance, which,
predictably, was more interested in the larger IDB loan. However, under MPS direction the project not
only flourished; it also took off with new, innovative activities. There have been, even recently, problems
with contracting, although only in terms of delays. The continued use of the UNDP as an intermediate
agency for administrative oversight may have added to the delays, and there have also been some conflicts
between Bank procurement rules and some of the innovations in electronic bidding introduced by Brazil.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Satisfactory with no further explanation needed.


8. Lessons Learned

PARSEP (I) is an excellent endorsement of the old LIL model, one which allowed the flexibility to learn by
doing. Its success in fact raises questions as to the new LIL format, actions based on a driving hypothesis,
because had it followed that model, it would not have achieved as much as it did. Thus the first lesson is
that in a situation where a problem has been identified but is not well understood, assistance to promote its
solution cannot follow a blueprint ­ it must leave the way open to utilize new knowledge and new
techniques developed during implementation. Here a useful comparison can be made with other LILs
facing many of the same circumstances (limited knowledge, changing circumstances, the initial
misassignment of responsibilities, and lengthy delays) which did not respond in this fashion. Whereas the
latter stuck with a program that was overtaken (and made less relevant) by events, the PARSEP project
was able to make course corrections which did not undermine the overall objectives even though they did
shift emphases and add new activities.

A second lesson, which follows from the first, is that fundamental policy change may have to build on
initial institutional strengthening. While not clearly stated in the PAD, it is the evaluators' suspicion that
the initial Bank support for this project anticipated more fundamental changes in the content of the pension
systems (less pay-as-you-go, a quicker shift to a reliance on complementary, private systems and so on).
However, for this to be possible, or to be usefully effected, a first need was to strengthen pension
management, especially as regards radically improving information systems and the capacity for doing
actuarial and other types of analysis. In effect, in pension reforms, and most probably in reforms of other
basic services, there are three dimensions involved: improvement of system management; improvement of
user services; and policy change. Arguably the first is essential to realize the other two, and whether or not



                                                     - 16 -

that was recognized at the inception of this project, it ended up being the major emphasis.

A third lesson is that reforms take time, but also that a reform which has languished apparently
unproductively for a few years may suddenly pick up speed. This poses a dilemma for those making
decisions on whether to extend or not ­ and there are certainly many cases of unproductive extensions
where the same lack of progress simply continued for a few more years. In the case of PARSEP, the
decision should have been easier as the project had already turned its metaphorical corner before the issue
came up. Thus, while TTLs will always be advocates, in this case there was more information on which to
base the decision.

As the first three lessons all hinge around information, the role of information as part of institutional
change deserves its own fourth lesson. From the beginning this project emphasized information, and the
emphasis only grew over the course of implementation.             While many Bank projects have an ICT
component, their focus is too often on providing equipment and software but not on its use to document
elements essential to performance or performance itself. Information management, by the states and by the
MPS, became the core of this project, and one result was the ability to advance other types of policy
reform. When problems are better understood, it becomes easier to design and forward proposals for their
resolution. Hence, when ICT is included in a project, the "I" requires emphasis and the project should be
designed to encourage its utilization at multiple levels of organizational operation.

A final lesson is that design shortcomings (whether as erroneously proposed solutions or failures to
anticipate new openings) should be given a chance for rectification in project implementation. This was the
advantage of the old-style LIL. To the extent anyone understands how it operates, it is not a feature of the
new LIL, nor in fact of many Bank "instruments." An initial developmental hypothesis is essential but if it
begins to look incorrect there should be incentives for corrective action. This, of course, requires proactive
supervision or at least frequent presence in the country and frequent in-depth exchanges with the
counterparts.

9. Partner Comments

(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
The following is a translation of the original comments provided in Portuguese. (See Annex 8)
PARSEP served 26 states and the Federal District, creating a natural network for the dissemination and
replication of results among these entities, and so accelerating the process of supporting and sensitizing
their technicians in reforming the state pension systems. The municipal systems benefited indirectly as a
majority of their managers participated, as guests of the state institutes, in the dissemination activities,
seminars and workshops sponsored by the program.

The principal thrust of the program, managed within the Secretariat of Social Security (Secretaria de
Prevedência Social, SPS), was the restructuring of the registries (cadasters) on active and retired public
servants kept by the states' pension regimes. The program's role was fundamental here. With accurate,
updated, and reliable data, PARSEP supported and financed the implementation of actuarial analyses of
state pension systems to the end of defining their short, medium and long term economic and financial
situations. On the basis of these studies, it became possible to formulate proposals for modifying the
norms for the participating entities, leading to a state level reform compatible with the guidelines of the
Federal Pension Reform.

To standardize and facilitate the creation and testing of the new databases in each local entity, following
their restructuring, the Ministry of Social Security (MPS) conceived, developed, provided free of charge,



                                                     - 17 -

and supported the installation of SIPREV ­ Integrated System of Pension Information ­ in both states and
municipalities. The following actions merit attention:

·        Installation of SIPREV in states and municipalities ­ Currently 20 states and 86 municipalities are
using SIPREV, incorporating the files of more than 1.5 million individuals.
·        SIPREV training in municipalities ­ 1,317 municipalities have benefited from the training,
including partnerships established with the National Confederation of Municipalities (CNM) and the Caixa
Ecônomica Federal.
·        Cross checking of SIPREV data with that of the Unified Data Base of Social Information (CNIS) ­
Three SIPREV data bases have been cross checked (Piaui, Goiás, and Joinville) with CNIS.                  The
comparison of data from other local entities is under way. The major difficulty is the definition of a routine
to allow the cross checking, a process now being realized jointly with the Social Security Technological and
Information Enterprise (DATAPREV).
·        Cross checking of SIPREV data with data of SISOBI ­ The pension data of 15 states and
municipalities has been compared with SISOBI (obituary registries). The results suggest an estimated
annual savings of R$ 466 million for all local systems.

It is worth noting that SIPREV makes possible the construction of a national database on all civil servants.
This is now legally mandated by Law 10,887 of June 18, 2004, regulating the application of Constitutional
Amendment No. 41 of December 19, 2003 and changing the relevant dispositions of Law 9,917 (November
27, 1998), Law 8,214 (July 24, 1991) and Law 9,532 (December 10, 1997).

Law 10,887 establishes in its article 3 that "in regard to the provisions of item XI of Article 37 of the
Federal Constitution, the Union, the States, the Federal District, and the Municipalities will implement an
integrated database on the remunerations, salaries, and pensions paid to active and retired civil servants and
members of the military and other recipients of state pensions, in the form dictated by the regulations."

In the face of this legal responsibility charged to all local entities vis-à-vis their own pension systems, the
installation of SIPREVV will be expanded, over a reasonable time and without causing problems, to the
nearly 2,200 existing pension regimes. A decree regulating Article 3 of the mentioned law is being drafted.

In the process of implementing SIPREV, the principal factors contributing to its success were the
following:

·        The well qualified and highly motivated team involved in the project
·        Partnerships with various local entities in implementing the project
·        The local entities' need for a pension management tool

The principal difficulties facing the process were the following:

·        The small size of the team vis-à-vis the task developing, implanting and maintaining the project
·        The lack of equipment with sufficient storage capacity to receive pension information from the
states and municipalities and cross check it with other data bases (CNIS, SISOBI, IBGE, etc.)
·        The lack of software for the execution and optimization of the relevant tasks (tools for
development, system documentation, for generating reports, etc)
·        The low technical capacity of the federal entities in informatics
·        The non-obligatory nature of adoption of the system
·        Lack of training and dissemination of the system among the federal entities.




                                                      - 18 -

The principal measures taken to overcome these problems were the following:

·        Development of a decree (now under way) to require the utilization of the tool (i.e. SIPREV) by the
local entities or at least, their provision of pension data to the central SIPREV data base in the MPS
·        SIPREV users received technical and operational support, by e-mail or phone, albeit in limited
form, to assist with the operational problems encountered.
·        Development of new system capabilities to make SIPREV more attractive to potential users
·        Initiation of negotiations with DATAPREV so that the enterprise could take over the housing,
development, and technical support for SIPREV, thus permitting the MPS technical team to focus on the
tasks of analysis and training and dissemination.

The principal modifications in the management of SIPREV: Currently, SIPREV is in its version
6.06.06 and in addition to being a tool for registering and management pension information, has new
functions, some of which have been finalized while others are still in their development stage. They are as
follows:

·        Module for Database Cleansing and Updating ("Recadastramento") ­ This module permits the
vetting of the lists of participants in the individual pension schemes. Its principal purpose is the periodic
and permanent updating of data on members of the public sector pension regimes (RPPS) so as to facilitate
the delivery of benefits, actuarial analyses, data management, and the generation of legal reports. (It
became available with version 6.06.01 as of December 5, 2004).
·        Calculation of Median Benefits ­ Developed with the objective of updating information on the
monthly salaries and the median contributions paid on them, as required by Law 10,887/2004. This
function has been utilized by various entities and is of great help in calculating the benefits to be paid to
public employees. (It became available with version 6.02.02 as of May 18, 2004.)
·        Export of Data for Actuarial Calculations ­ Following the consolidation of the individual,
functional, pension and financial information on public employees into a single database and their further
validation, these data are exported in the ACCESS format to allow actuarial analysis via other available
tools. ( This function was made available with version 6.06.03 as of July 27, 2004.)
·        Readjustment of Actuarial Model to the Requirements of Constitutional Amendment 41/2003 ­
The actuarial module allows the review and standardization of the registry data, budgetary planning of
personnel costs; simulation of financing alternatives, and the application of pension regulations. It includes
not only the innovations required by Constitutional Amendment 41, but also was completely restructured in
the interests of greater efficiency, better performance, and greater ease of utilization. Its contents were
specified by the CGAET and implemented by the CGIG, and were tested with the SIAPE data base (for the
Federal Government), in 6 states, and 2 municipalities. It became available with version 6.06.04 in
December 3, 2004.
·        Module for Simulation of Benefits ­ This allows the storage of historical data on employees and
their dependents covered in the pension regimes; verifies participants' eligibility in accordance with the
legislation in force; calculates and processes benefits to be paid; and processes the data to be included on
payment statements.         It also simulates pension payments in accord with rules established under
Constitutional Amendment 41. (This became available with version 6.06.05 on April 1, 2004.)
·        New Module for Importation of Data to SIPREV ("Bridge Module") ­ Because of the many
problems encountered in developing the prior module, a new application was developed to allow the initial
data input from existing registries via temporary equivalency tables, the validation of the data, their
correction, and their posterior transfer to the definitive SIPREV database. This improved Module for
importing data became available with version 6.06.04 on December 3, 2004.
·        New SIPREV Products ­ Among those implemented were a new listing of receipts and expenses,
a registry of careers, readjustments in the job inventory, readjustments in the job history, certificates of


                                                       - 19 -

time of contributions (CTC), reports on inputting errors, inventory of financial responsibility, and inventory
of legal authorizations. This became available in versions 6.06.01 through 6.06.04
·        Routines for Cross Checking of SIPREV and CNIS data ­ This allows the exchange of
information between the individual pension regime databases (registered in SIPREV) and those in the
Social Security data base (CNIS). This exercise is essential in calculating benefits due to public employees
(RPPS).
·        Routines for Cross Checking data from SIPREV with those from SISOBI (obituaries) ­ With
the objective of combating pension fraud, data from state and municipal registries is cross-checked with
those from SISOBI (managed by the INSS).

The MPS website also provides a discussion forum for SIPREV users, allowing them to exchange
information and suggestions on the system.

It bears mentioning that the actions taken to update pension registries and implement SIPREV, in the sense
of promoting the restructuring of the individual social pension schemes and putting them in conformity with
the new federal legislation, were more successful than had been hoped, largely because of the local entities'
need to produce these changes within the legal deadlines and the support PARSEP could provide.

In the face of the federal reforms beginning with the Constitutional Amendments 20/98 and 41/03, and
considering the required legal validation of the adequate adoption of the mandated measures (via the
Certificate of Pension Regularity, CRP), without which serious sanctions would be applied to the agencies
found in default, it is expected that through PARSEP, a great effort will continue in promoting the reforms
and adjustments needed to create financial-actuarial equilibrium in the state pension systems.

Despite certain procurement delays, linked to the rules of the IFIs, the technical assistance provided by the
SPS has been able to address the great weaknesses and needs of the states and municipalities in the area of
public employee pensions. In spite of the difficulties in the implementation of PARSEP, the MPS added
the knowledge, with the tools and technologies needed to operate in a participatory and transparent fashion
and with the support of the principal actors, required to reformulate the pension systems for federal, state
and municipal employees, thus achieving one of its principal objectives for attaining the government's goals

It is of fundamental importance that there is continuity in this work through the PARSEP II project, to
cover work not yet concluded in the various states, and especially as regards the other branches of
government and the strengthening of the RPPS and SPS in the following areas:

·        Diagnosis and proposal for a structural and management model for the individual pension regimes
to bring them into conformity with federal legal requirements
·        Diagnosis of disability payments to public servants.
·        Further support for training of RPPS technical staff, especially in actuarial analysis, investment of
funds, technology and information, accounting, and pension management.
·        Support to the Secretaria for Social Security Policy (SPPS) in strategic planning and the
construction of performance indicators for the RPPS.

Additional Annex 8. COMENTÁRIOS PARA O RELATÓRIO DO BIRD

O PARSEP atendeu 26 estados e o Distrito Federal, tendo criado uma rede natural de disseminação e
multiplicação de resultados aos entes, ensejando maior velocidade no processo de oferecimento de subsídios
e conscientização dos seus técnicos que contribuíram para que se efetivasse a reforma dos sistemas de
previdência estadual. Indiretamente os sistemas municipais foram beneficiados, pois a grande maioria dos
gestores participou, como convidados dos Institutos Estaduais, das ações de disseminação, nos Seminários
e Workshops realizados pelo programa.

A principal vertente do Programa, gerenciado no âmbito da Secretaria de Previdência Social ­ SPS, foi a
reestruturação do cadastro previdenciário dos servidores públicos vinculados aos regimes próprios de
previdência de estados, no qual o Programa mostrou-se como fundamental.

Com informações seguras, confiáveis e atualizadas, o Programa apoiou e custeou a realização de
diagnóstico atuarial dos sistemas de previdência estadual, com o intuito de definir a situação
econômico-financeira de curto, médio e longo prazos dos institutos de previdência.

A partir desse diagnóstico, foi possível estabelecer a formulação de proposta de alteração legislativa das
normas previdenciárias dos entes participantes, ensejando reforma previdenciária no nível estadual,
consoante os ditames da Reforma Previdenciária Federal.

Para homogeneizar e facilitar o processo de geração e povoamento da nova BASE DE DADOS integrada
de cada ente federado, após a realização do recadastramento, o Ministério da Previdência Social concebeu,
desenvolveu, disponibilizou gratuitamente e apoiou a implementação do Sistema Integrado de Informações
Previdenciárias ­ SIPREV, que atende tanto aos estados quanto aos municípios. Destacamos as principais
ações implementadas:

·        Implantação do SIPREV nos Estados e Municípios - Atualmente são 20 Estados e 86
municípios utilizando o SIPREV abrangendo mais de 1,5 milhões de registros.
·        Treinamento do SIPREV nos Municípios - 1.317 municípios treinados, incluindo as parcerias
estabelecidas com a Confederação Nacional de              Municípios - CNM e Caixa Econômica Federal.
·        Cruzamento dos dados do SIPREV com o CNIS - Foi realizado o cruzamento de 03 bases de
dados (Piauí, Goiás e Joinville) com o CNIS. O                   cruzamento com as bases de dados dos outros
entes federados está em fase de andamento, sendo que a maior dificuldade encontrada atualmente
para a consecução dessa atividade diz respeito à definição da rotina adequada para realizar este
cruzamento, que terá que ser definida juntamente                 com a Empresa de Tecnologia e Informações da
Previdência Social (DATAPREV).
·        Cruzamento dos dados do SIPREV com os dados do SISOBI - Foi efetuado o cruzamento de
15 bases de Estados e Municípios com o Sistema            de Óbitos, resultando numa economia estimada
para os entes federados de R$ 466 milhões/ano.

É importante ressaltar que o SIPREV possibilitará a construção de um Banco de Dados Nacional dos
Servidores Públicos. Há, sobre isto, um mandamento legal estabelecido pela Lei 10.887, de 18/06/2004,
que dispõe sobre a aplicação de disposições da Emenda Constitucional no. 41, de 19 de dezembro de 2003,
e altera dispositivos das Leis nos 9.717, de 27 de novembro de 1998, 8.213, de 24 de julho de 1991, 9.532,
de 10 de dezembro de 1997.

A Lei 10.887 estabelece em seu artigo 3º que: "para os fins do disposto no inciso XI do art. 37 da



                                                    - 32 -

Constituição Federal, a União, os Estados, o Distrito Federal e os Municípios instituirão sistema
integrado de dados relativos às remunerações, proventos e pensões pagos aos respectivos servidores e
militares, ativos e inativos, e pensionistas, na forma do regulamento."

Em face dessa responsabilidade legal imputada aos entes federados que mantêm regime próprio de
previdência social, a implantação do SIPREV será incrementada, em prazo suficiente e sem causar
prejuízos, pelos cerca de 2.200 regime próprio de previdência social existentes. Deverá ser editado um
decreto regulamentando o art. 3º. da mencionada Lei.

No processo de Implantação do Sistema Integrado de Informações Previdenciárias ­ SIPREV, os principais
fatores de sucesso para o alcance dos resultados alcançados:

·       Boa qualidade e motivação da equipe envolvida no projeto;

·       Parceria com alguns entes federados na implementação do projeto;

·       Necessidade e interesse dos entes em relação a uma ferramenta de gestão previdenciária.



As principais dificuldades para atingir os resultados, no processo de implementação do SIPREV foram:

·       Equipe muito pequena para desenvolvimento, implementação e manutenção do projeto;

·       Falta de equipamento com maior capacidade de armazenamento para recebimento das informações
previdenciárias dos entes federados e cruzamento com outras bases de dados correlatas (CNIS, SISOBI,
IBGE, etc.);

·       Falta de softwares específicos para execução e otimização dos trabalhos correlatos ao projeto
(ferramentas de desenvolvimento, de documentação de sistemas, de geração de relatórios, etc.)

·       Baixa capacitação técnica em informática nos entes federados;

·       Inexistência de obrigatoriedade legal para utilização da ferramenta;

·       Falta de treinamento e disseminação do Sistema nos entes federados.



As principais providências adotadas para eliminar os problemas no processo de implementação do
SIPREV foram:

·       Decreto em fase de elaboração que obriga a utilização da ferramenta pelos entes federados, ou pelo
menos, o envio dos dados previdenciários ao Módulo Central do SIPREV no MPS;

·       Os usuários do SIPREV recebem suporte técnico e operacional, por e-mail ou telefone, ainda que
de forma limitada em decorrência das dificuldades operacionais já apresentadas;

·       Desenvolvimento de novas funcionalidades no Sistema de forma a torná-lo mais atraente para
utilização pelos entes federados.




                                                    - 33 -

·        Início da fase de negociação com a DATAPREV para que esta possa assumir a hospedagem,
desenvolvimento e suporte técnico do SIPREV, de forma a permitir que a equipe técnica atualmente lotada
no MPS fique apenas com a parte de análise do negócio e possa dar prioridade aos treinamentos e
divulgação do sistema.

As principais modificações na gestão do SIPREV foram:

Atualmente, o SIPREV está na versão 6.06.06 e, além de uma ferramenta de Cadastro e de Gerenciamento
de Informações Previdenciárias, como inicialmente projetado, conta com novas funcionalidades, sendo que
algumas delas já finalizadas e outras em fase de implementação, conforme abaixo:

·        Módulo de Recadastramento ­ este módulo permite o recadastramento dos participantes dos
regimes próprios de previdência. Tem como principal objetivo a atualização periódica e permanente de
dados cadastrais e funcionais dos segurados dos RPPS, de forma a facilitar o processo de concessão de
benefícios, o cálculo atuarial, o acompanhamento gerencial das informações, a geração dos relatórios
legais, etc (disponibilizado na versão 6.06.01, em 12.05.2004).
·        Cálculo do Benefício Médio no SIPREV ­ desenvolvido com o objetivo de atualizar as
remunerações mensais e efetuar o cálculo da média dos salários de contribuição, conforme determina a Lei
nº 10.887/2004. Esta funcionalidade tem sido utilizada por diversos entes, pois é de grande auxílio no
cálculo da aposentadoria dos servidores (disponibilizado na versão 6.06.02, em 18.05.2004).
·        Exportação dos dados para o Cálculo Atuarial ­ após a consolidação das informações
cadastrais, funcionais, previdenciárias e financeiras dos segurados do RPPS em um único banco de dados,
esses dados são criticados, validados e posteriormente exportados no formato ACCESS para a realização
do cálculo atuarial, utilizando qualquer outra ferramenta (disponibilizado na versão 6.06.03, em
27.07.2004).
·        Novo Módulo de Transmissão de dados para o Módulo Central - totalmente refeito para
atender de forma mais eficiente às necessidades do usuário externo, ou seja, dos entes federados
(disponibilizado na versão 6.06.03, em 27.07.2004).
·        Adequação do Módulo Atuarial à EC 41/2003 ­ o módulo Atuarial realiza a crítica e
consistência de dados cadastrais e funcionais, planejamento orçamentário de gastos de pessoal; simulação
de formas de financiamento e aplicação da legislação previdenciária. Foram implementadas não só as
inovações introduzidas pela EC 41, como também realizada uma reestruturação completa deste módulo, de
forma a torná-lo mais eficiente, com melhor performance e de mais fácil utilização. Foi especificado pela
CGAET e implementado pela CGIG, tendo sido testado com a base SIAPE (Governo Federal), de 06
estados e 02 municípios (disponibilizado na versão 6.06.04, em 03.12.2004).
·        Módulo de Simulação de Concessão de Benefícios ­ propicia o armazenamento do histórico
cadastral e funcional dos servidores e seus dependentes; faz a verificação de elegibilidade dos participantes
de acordo com a legislação em vigor; cálculo e processamento de benefícios a serem concedidos; realiza a
conferência de valores a serem informados à folha de pagamento. Faz ainda a simulação dos benefícios de
aposentadoria com as normas vigentes a partir da EC 41. (disponibilizado na versão 6.06.05, em
01/04/2005).
·        Novo Módulo de Importação de Dados para o SIPREV (Módulo Ponta) ­ em função dos
muitos problemas apresentados no aplicativo anterior, foi feito um novo aplicativo que faz a carga inicial
dos dados para tabelas temporárias, valida os dados, permite sua correção e posterior importação para a
base definitiva do SIPREV. Melhoria de Performance do Módulo de Importação (disponibilizado na versão
6.06.04, em 03.12.2004).
·        Novas Páginas no SIPREV ­ Foram implementados: novo Demonstrativo de Receitas e Despesas
/ Cadastro de Carreiras / Ajuste no Cadastro de Cargos / Ajuste no Histórico Funcional / Certificado de



                                                    - 34 -

Tempo de Contribuição (CTC) / Relatório de Erros de Importação / Cadastro de Responsável Financeiro /
Cadastro de Procurações (disponibilizadas nas versões de 6.06.01 a 6.06.04).
·        Rotinas de Cruzamento dos Dados do SIPREV com o CNIS ­ Realiza o intercâmbio de
informações entre o Regime Próprio de Previdência Social, registrados no SIPREV, e o Regime Geral de
Previdência Social, registrados no CNIS. Estas informações são necessárias para o processo de concessão
de benefícios dos segurados dos RPPS.
·        Rotinas de Cruzamento dos Dados do SIPREV com os Dados do SISOBI - Com o objetivo de
combate à fraude previdenciária é realizado o cruzamento e checagem das informações estaduais e
municipais com o Sistema Nacional de Óbitos do INSS - SISOBI.

Foi disponibilizada, também, no sítio do Ministério da Previdência, uma lista de discussão (fórum) do
SIPREV, permitindo que os entes troquem informações e sugestões sobre o sistema.

Não obstante, as ações voltadas para a produção de novo cadastro previdenciário e implementação do
SIPREV, no sentido de promover a adequação e reestruturação dos regimes próprios de previdência social
à legislação federal vigente, obtiveram sucesso acima do esperado, principalmente em razão da necessidade
desses entes em promover, dentro dos prazos legais, as modificações impostas pela Lei, com o apoio do
PARSEP.

Em face das reformas previdenciárias federal promovidas a partir de 1998 - EC 20/98 e EC 41/03 - e
considerando os ditames legais estabelecidos pelo Certificado de Regularidade Previdenciária - CRP quanto
à adoção de medidas para adequação dos regimes próprios de previdência social, sem o que estão previstas
sanções graves aos entes, a expectativa é de que, após o Parsep, um grande esforço seja empreendido no
sentido de promover as reformas e adequações que trarão equilíbrio financeiro-atuarial aos sistemas
estaduais de previdência.

Em que pese à morosidade dos processos licitatórios vinculados às regras de organismos financeiros
internacionais, a assistência técnica prestada pela Secretaria de Previdência Social - SPS tem ido de
encontro à grande carência e necessidade de estados e municípios no campo da previdência no serviço
público.

Apesar das dificuldades, com a execução do PARSEP, o MPS agregou conhecimentos, com os
instrumentos e as tecnologias necessárias para atuar de forma participativa e transparente ­ com o apoio
dos principais atores ­ no processo de reformulação dos sistemas de previdência dos servidores públicos
federais, estaduais e municipais, cumprindo assim um dos seus objetivos para o atingimento de suas metas
de governo.

É de fundamental importância que haja a continuidade dos trabalhos, com financiamento do PARSEP II,
em ações que deixaram de ser executadas nos diversos Estados, especialmente as relativas a outros
poderes e se possa proporcionar o fortalecimento das estruturas dos RPPS e da SPS, em particular as
relativas a:
         - Diagnóstico e proposta da estrutura e modelo de gestão dos entes dos regimes próprios visando à
adequação aos normativos federais;
         - Diagnóstico dos benefícios por incapacidade dos servidores públicos;
         - Apoio para a capacitação dos técnicos dos RPPS, especialmente em atuária, investimentos,
Tecnologia da Informação, Contabilidade e gestao                 previdenciária;
         - Apoio à Secretaria de Políticas de Previdência Social na estruturação de um planejamento
estratégico e na construção de indicadores de                    desempenho voltados para os RPPS.
