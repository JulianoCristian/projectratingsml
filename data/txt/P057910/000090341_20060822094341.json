Lessons learned from the\n            project: PARSEP (I) is an excellent endorsement of the old\n            LIL model, one which allowed the flexibility to learn by\n            doing. Its success in fact raises questions as to the new\n            LIL format, actions based on a driving hypothesis, because\n            had it followed that model, it would not have achieved as\n            much as it did. Fundamental policy change may have to build\n            on initial institutional strengthening.
