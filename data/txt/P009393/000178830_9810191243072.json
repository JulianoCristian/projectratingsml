The proposed\n            credit would finance: construction, furniture and equipment\n            for the Secretariat of the National Council for Skill\n            Development and Training (NCSDT) and for five Technical\n            Training Centers (TTCs) at Barisal, Bogra, Comilla, Khulna\n            and Mymensingh. Furthermore, it would provide equipment for\n            two existing TTCs at Mirpur and Rajshahi; additional staff\n            salaries and training materials for NCSDT, for the five new\n            TTCs and for the introduction of short courses at four\n            existing TTC's (Mirpur, Rajshahi, Chittagong and\n            Bangla-German) on a declining basis. The project would also\n            include staff training for about 415 instructors for the\n            TTCs and about 1,500 training personnel for in-plant\n            training; and technical assistance and fellowships. The\n            project would increase the output of skilled and\n            semi-skilled workers from about 600 per annum at present to\n            over 10,000 by 1983."}, "docdt": "1979-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
