unsatisfactory: a strategic opportunity to achieve\n            significant institutional and commercial gains was wasted.\n            Water production and waste water treatment capacities were\n            not balanced by corresponding water distribution and waste\n            water collection capacities; the project has not changed\n            significantly the provision of water supply service to lower\n            income communities nor the ambient water quality of the\n            Nairobi river; and the project has failed completely to\n            improve the commercial and financial performance of\n            Nairobi's water and sewerage department (WSD) and has\n            not resolved issues of WSD autonomy and the incentive\n            framework. Lessons learned were that 1) the International\n            Development Association (IDA) should not finance projects\n            unless the borrower is committed to implementing policy and\n            institutional reforms that would guarantee their\n            sustainability; 2) IDA should insist on the creation of\n            water utility companies prior to financing major development\n            projects; 3) IDA should encourage borrowers to seek private\n            sector participation options; 4) IDA must carefully design\n            financial covenants, watch performance indicators agreed\n            upon during negotiations, and act decisively soon after\n            evidence of violation appears; and 5) water supply and\n            sanitation projects must be designed to achieve a balance\n            between production and distribution capacities, and waste\n            water treatment and collection capacities so that project\n            benefits reach the intended beneficiaries."}, "docdt": "1998-12-17T00:00:00Z"}
