{"cdata!": "The objectives of the project are to\n            reduce pollution of international and Chinese territorial\n            waters caused by ship's wastes through: a) improved\n            monitoring and analysis of the nature and magnitude of the\n            problem; b) improved policy, regulatory, and incentive\n            frameworks; and c) the provision of infrastructure to\n            receive and safely dispose of ship wastes.  The project\n            consists of two components: a national component and a ports\n            component.  The national component will: 1) establish\n            baseline data on international ship traffic, related waste\n            types and quantities through a pilot interport ship waste\n            monitoring system (SEATRACK); 2) prepare a comprehensive\n            accident (oil pollution) contingency plan for each port; 3)\n            initiate a Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) monitoring program\n            for the Yellow Sea; 4) undertake a study of the treatment of\n            chemically contaminated water; 5) upgrade environmental\n            monitoring capabilities at the ports, coastal waters and\n            international waters; and 6) provide consultant's\n            services and training.  The port's component will: i)\n            define, design, and provide land-based collection and\n            disposal facilities at the ports of Dalian, Tianjin,\n            Shanghai, Ningbo, Xiamen and Guangzhou; and ii) upgrade\n            environmental monitoring and enforcement capabilities of\n            each of the port authorities."}, "docdt": "1992-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
