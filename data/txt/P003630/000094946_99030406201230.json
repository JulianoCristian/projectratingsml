The key lessons learned\n            include: 1) Success of the project can be attributed to both\n            the Borrower's and the Bank's approach to the\n            project. The Bank utilized a multidisciplinary team of an\n            economic/financial analyst, a port engineer, and a marine\n            environmental specialist. This provided a consistency\n            throughout the project, from design and appraisal to\n            implementation. Further, 10 Chinese agencies and ministries\n            were involved in the project. 2) Port and coastal\n            environmental management is inherently complex due to\n            overlapping jurisdictions of different departments and\n            ministries, port authorities, and private interests. If\n            China did not already have a strong and existing regulatory\n            base upon which the project could be constructed, coupled\n            with good leadership from Ministry of Communications, the\n            project would have been much more difficult to implement and\n            would likely have required more time. 3) The success of a\n            ship waste project can be enhanced by a) adoption of an\n            environmental coastal zone and port management plan; b)\n            implementation of other pollution control activities; and c)\n            control and management of land-based sources of pollution."}, "docdt": "1997-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
