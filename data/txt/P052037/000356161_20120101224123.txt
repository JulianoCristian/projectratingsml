                        Extension of Closing Date
  VIETNAM — HO CHI MINH CITY ENVIRONMENTAL SANITATION (NHIEU
                  LOC-THI NGHE BASIN) PROJECT
                             P052037
                     CREDIT NUMBER 4708-VN

                                 Restructuring Paper

1. The closing date for Vietnam, HO CHI MINH CITY ENVIRONMENTAL
   SANITATION (NHIEU LOC-THI NGHE BASIN) PROJECT (P052037/P117877),
   Credit No. 4708 will be extended from December 31, 2011 until June 30, 2012.

2. The Project was originally approved in March 2001 with an IDA Credit of SDR127.5
   million (then equivalent to US$166 million). The Credit Closing date was for 2.5
   years to June 30, 2010 and again March 2010 when an Additional Credit of SDR58
   million (US$90 million equivalent) was approved to cover cost over runs resulting
   from inflation. A revised closing date for the new Financing Agreement (Amended
   and Restated Development Credit Agreement) which governs both the Original Credit
   (3475-VN) and the Additional Credit (4708-VN) was established as December 31,
   2011.

3. Excellent progress has been made on the Project implementation, and the Project is
   now about 95% complete. The 8 kilometer interceptor is fully completed as is the
   pumping station. Most of the over 70 kilometers of drains and sewers are completed
   and so is the canal landscaping. The impacts of the Project to date are impressive,
   with reduced flooding in the city center and improved water quality in the canal
   already being realized. The improved canal has also had a transformational impact on
   the cityscape by turning an open sewer into a valuable city waterfront asset. The six
   month extension of the Additional Credit will allow the Project to be fully completed
   and for the IDA funds to be fully utilized by the City. The Project Development
   Objective is expected to be met and the Project is currently rated as Satisfactory.

4. The proposed extension is necessary to complete on-going works nearing completion.
   All IDA funds are committed. The remaining work, which is expected to be
   completed by the end of April 2012, consists of: (i) soils stabilization around the
   canal interfaces with bridges; (ii) the fabrication and installation of the temporary
   sewer outfall in the Saigon River; and (iii) the remaining canal dredging work (about
   20% of the total).

5. This will be the 5th extension of the Project. The Project’s original closing date was
   December 31, 2007 was extended to December 31, 2009 through a two step process

                                           2
   (first extension of six months, then a second extension of 18 months based on good
   implementation progress). The closing date was later extended again to June 30,
   2010 (approved by the RVP) in order to process the Additional Financing request and
   then again to December 31, 2011 (approved by the Board) with the approval of the
   Additional Financing. These extensions were for Credit No. 3475-VN. This is the
   first extension request for the Additional Financing (Credit No. 4708-VN) and will
   result in a six month extension of the Additional Credit closing date.

6. The Financial Management Specialist has reviewed the extension request. There are
   no outstanding audit reports.
