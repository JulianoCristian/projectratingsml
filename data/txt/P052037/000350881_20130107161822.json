Vietnam were as follows: overall outcome was moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            and both the Bank and the Borrower performance were\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            need to understand the political economy around the\n            institutional decentralization process in Vietnam. Despite\n            intensive efforts to set up a realistic implementation\n            agenda, it was not possible to predict the time for approval\n            processes on the government side or the reasons behind the\n            additional reviews at different government levels.\n            Construction in dense urban environments: in cities like\n            HCMC urban utilities need to start thinking of mapping their\n            infrastructure using Geographic Information System (GIS)\n            tools.
