                         is on track to substantially meeting its project objectives, which will be confirmed during the preparation of the ICR: (i) the incidence of flooding in the NLTN catchment area has
                         already been realized with the dredging and improvement of the canal; (ii) the interceptor and construction and rehabilitation of primary and secondary sewers has increased the
                         wastewater collection in the catchment area; and (iii) the wastewater fees have been increased to VND450 per cubic meter (the target) as required and there is a road map to further
                         increase the fees through 2015. Water quality impacts on the NLTN canal resulting from the project's operation cannot be assessed at this point but a series of water quality
