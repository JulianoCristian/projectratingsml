                         2. Progress towards the development objectives is clear. Though no benefits will be fully realized until the Project is 100% complete and operational due to the nature of the
                         drainage system, once operational the project will benefit over 1.2 million people in the city center with reduced flooding, improved wastewater collection, reduced pollution in the
                         NLTN canal and a substantially improved water front asset in the city center. Institutional progress is also good, with tariff increases having been initiated to a point where they now
                         cover about 75% of O&M costs for drainage/sanitation and the city has approved a tariff increase road map for future financial cost recovery of O&M and short lived assets. The
                         drainage/wastewater sector has been restructured to create the Flood Control Center with Department Level status which also includes separation of assets from O&M, the latter of
                         which is now done under contract to specialized service providers.
