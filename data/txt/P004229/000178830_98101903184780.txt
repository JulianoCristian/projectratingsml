NUTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RBOONSTRUCTION AIC DEVELOPMENT
REPORT ANI REGOP1MENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE SARAH PORTS AUTHORITY FOR A
PORTS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$16.1 million to
the Sabah Ports Authority (SPA) to be guaranteed by Malaysia. The
proposed loan, which would be the first to the SPA and the first for a
transport project in Malaysia, would cover the foreign exchange cost of
the project. It would be for a term of 20 years, including four years
of grace, and would bear interest at 7¼ percent per annum.
2.        The proposed loan would be the Bank's sixteenth in Malaysia,
taking into account the proposed loan for the Second Telecommunications
Project which is presented in my report and recommendation of the same
date. A statement of earlier loans and IFG investments in Malaysia is
contained in that report, which also summarizes the latest economic report
on Malaysia dated May 17, 1971. (Sae also Annexes I and II).
PART I - PROJECT BACKGROUND
The Geographical Setting
3.        Geographically, Malaysia is divided into two distinctive parts
separated by the South China Sea - 'sTest Malaysia on the Malay Peninsula
and East Malaysia, comprising the States of Sabah and Sarawak in the
northern part of the island of Borneo (see Map 1). Although East Malaysia
is the larger part in area, it has only about 15 percent of the nation's
population; this is reflected in an average population density of about
20 inhabitants per square mile (8 inhabitants per km2) ip East Malaysia
compared with 180 per square mile (70 inhabitants per km ) in West Malaysia.
In terms of economic development, East Malaysia is generally less advanced
than West Malaysia.
4.        The State of Sabah has an area of about 30,000 sq.mi. (76,000 km )
and a population of about 650,000 largely in the coastal plain. It is
predominantly mountainous and covered with dense tropical forests. The
coastal plains are generally swampy and traversed by numerous rivers and
streams. This topography makes overland transport difficult and expensive,
and emphasizes the importance of ports and shipping in the transport system.
The mode of transport between centers of economic activity and from them
to places outside the state is mainly by sea for goods and by air for
passengers.
5.        Sabah's economy conforms to the classic pattern of developing
tropical countries, exporting primary agricultural products and importing
nearly all its consumer goods and capital equipment. In 1969 exports from
Sabah by value represented about 12 percent of the Malaysian total, with
timber being predominant.  Palm oil is expected to increase substantially
in importance as an export in the near future, while rubber production and
export are expected to more or less stagnate,

The Transport Sector
6.        Although the proposed loan would extend the Bank's financing
of development in 1Malaysia into a new sector, this is not the Bank's
first association with the transport system of the country, as it served
as the Executing Agency for a UNDP-financed general transport survey in
Malaysia made in 1967-68.12  In general the findings and recommendations
of the study are incorporated in the current Second Malaysia Plan for the
period 1971-75, and the proposed project was identified as a high-priority
item by this study.
7.        Allocation for transport under the First Malaysia Plan (1966-70)
was kept rather small, as it was felt by the Government that a comprehensive
assessment of priorities for investment in transport in the whole country
was needed before decisions on major new commitments could be taken. Further,
it was felt that a basic transport network already existed in West Malaysia
as a result of substantial investment during the preceding decade when the
transport sector received the largest share of public investment, and that
it was thus possible to give higher priority to other sectors for the time
being.
8.        Thus, while the allocation for transport under the First Malaysia
Plan was about M$500 million, the Second iYalaysia Plan now allocates nearly
M$1,200 million following the recommendations of the transport survey.
Noteworthy is the emphasis given to investment for transport in East Malaysiat
it is proposed that this area will get about one-third of the national total
for the sector. Out of the total allocation of Mvj$700 million for the State
of Sabah in the Second Malaysia Plan, roughly one-third will go to transport,
9.        The general strategy is to give priority in West Malaysia to
railwvays and highways, where also institutional improvements are to be
sought. In East Malaysia top priority are the improvement of ports and
airports (which together get over 40 percent of the investment) and the
establishment of a basic highwfay network. The proposed Bank lending
supports this strategy, beginning with this first loan for ports in Sabah.
In the next one or two fiscal years I expect to present to you further loans
for transport, in the first instance for the railways and for highway
construction in W-est Malaysia.
10.       Other agencies have also provided, or intend to provide, financial
assistance to Malaysia for transport projects or studies arising out of the
General Transport Survey.  The Asian Develop;nent Bank has made a loan for
port development in the State of Sarawak in East Malaysia and is considering
a loan for high-ways in West Malaysia. UK Special Aid has financed part of
the modernization program for the Malayan Railway and studies for several
transport projects including the Kota Kinabalu airport in Sabah and the
Federal Highway. Canadian financing is being sought for master plan
studies for other priority airports.

11.       Transport planning and coordination in Malaysia is the responsi-
bility of the Transport Planning Unit in the Ministry of Transport, and
for detailed highway planning there is a Highway Planning Unit in the
Public Wgorks Department of the Ministry of Works, Posts and Telecommuni-
cations. These units were set up in conjunction with the UNDP-financed
transport survey, and the UiDP -rant included provision for the services
of two transport planning experts for two years each and training abroad
for Malaysian officials for a total of four man-years. Both these
programs are now under way, and in addition other personnel are being
sent abroad for training under other programs including the EDI transport-
ation projects course. It is important, especially in view of the fact
that many of the investments proposed in the Second Malaysia Plan are only
provisionally identified, that these planning units be strengthened and
that the Government keep them staffed with adequately trained Malaysians.
12.       It is recognized that one of the major obstacles which the
Government must overcome if it is to implement its very large investment
program in the transport sector, is the present limited capacity for
preparing and implementing projects, particularly the very restricted
engineering capacity of the Federal Government's and State Governments'
Public lbrks Departments. Since the investment proposed in the Second
Malaysia Plan is three times that of the past five years, it is clear
that this particular constraint must be overcome if the ambitious targets
of the Plan are to be achieved.
PART II - THE PROJECT
13.       An appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of Sabah Ports Project -
Malaysia" (PTR-82a) is being circulated separately. A summary of the
project's main features is given in Annex III. The location of the major
ports concerned is shown on the attached maps.
14.       Kota Kinabalu and Sandakan are two of the largest ports in
Sabah, handling some 60 percent of its imports and 80 percent of its
exports. Existing facilities in both ports are insufficient to handle
even the present cargo offered. Furthermore the present wharves are in
poor structural condition because of marine borer attacks, and too weak
to support loads required by modern, efficient cargo-handling equipment;
they cannot be economically repaired. Port congestion is increasing.
15.       In 1963 and 1967 Messrs. Sir Bruce White, WTolfe-Barry and
Partners, Consulting Engineers (London), presented reports to the
Federal Government on the development of the ports of Kota Kinabalu
and Sandakan which pointed out the inadequacy of the existing facilities
and the measures required for improvement. In 1968 their findings were
confirmed in the general transport survey discussed earlier. Subsequently,
at the request of the Government, USAID commissioned King & Gavaris (USA)
consulting en-ineers, to prepare feasibility studies and preliminary designs
for the rehabilitation and expansion of these ports. Their report, issued
in September 1970, forms the basis of the proposed project.



16.       The project includes virtually new ports at both towns, comprising
construction at each of about 1,750 feet (350 m) of quay, a transit shed,
and administrative and workshop buildings. Also included are consultant's
services for detailed engineering and construction supervision, and further
soil investigation and hydrographic studies. Further the project provides
for cargo-handling equipment for Kota Kinabalu, Sandakan, Tawau and three
minor ports in Sabah, and for training of SPA's operational and management
personnel.
17.       The total cost of the project is estimated at about US$22.1
million equivalent. The proposed loan of US416.1 million represents some
73 percent of project cost and would cover the estimated foreign exchange
component. Of this amount, a maximum of US$300,000 equivalent would be
required for retroactive financing of detailed engineering and of soil
investigations and hydrographic studies as from September 1, 1970.   SPA
intends to finance the project's local costs, estimated at US$6.0 million
equivalent, from its internally generated resources (paragraph 23).
18.       Procurement of goods and services wvould be in accordance with
the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. In the comparison of bids a margin
of preference of 15 percent or the actual tariff duty, whichever is less,
would be applied in favor of goods manufactured or processed in Malaysia
to a substantial extent. Procurement in Malaysia is, however, likely to
be very small.
19.       Importation of project materials would not be subject to import
restrictions other than normal import duties.  Labor is scarce, and the
State Government has undertaken to allow, within its power, SPA and its
civil works contractors to hire and employ such labor as is not available
within the State and is needed for efficient project execution. It was
confirmed during negotiations that contractors w*ould be allowed to bring
in labor from abroad provided they had made reasonable efforts in the
first instance to find such labor within Malaysia.
20.       The balance of SPA's capital investment program during the
period of construction (1971-1974) is estimated at US$0.9 million equivalent
and would consist of the construction of a transit shed and dredging at
Tawau and of small additions and replacements, mainly of cargo-handling
equipment, at this and other ports. SPA's total investment program during
1971-74 thus amounts to US$23.0 equivalent. No major development is
currently envisaged before 1975. During negotiations SPA agreed to seek
Bank approval for yearly capital expenditures in the period 1971-74 exceed-
ing US$0.5 million equivalent.
21.       The proposed Borrower, SPA, is an agency responsible to the
Minister of Communications and Works in the State of Sabah but with
substantial autonomy; its budgets do not require Government approval,
and it can set its own rates. SPA is managed by a Board consisting of
a chairman, deputy chairman and eight members, two of whom must be public



service officers. Port users are adequately represented on the Board.
The Authority has been able to recruit an experienced port manager for the
position of General Manager. SPA was set up in late 1967 and is presently
operating the ports of Kota Kinabalu and Tawau. It will take over the
operations at the port of Sandakan by July 31, 1971, prior to disbursement
of the loan for the Sandakan part of the project. SPA will also assume
responsibility for the port of Labuan and four minor ports during 1971 and
1972. Provision, through the acquisition of land, is also being made for
future expansion in due course at both project ports.
22.       SPA has been well managed.   It has succeeded recently in filling
senior staff vacancies despite the difficulties caused largely by the
general shortage of experienced professionals throughout the public service.
During negotiations it confirmed its preparedness to use temporary expert
assistance to supplement its IMalaysian senior staff if this shoeuld bec',me
necessary.
23.       SPA's current financial situation is sound. The projections of
its cash flow (1971-77) indicate that, with the proposed loan and without
significant chanige in its tariffs, SPA could generate enough cash to
finance this program, after allowing for foreseeablo expenditures, including
imCra.ot duties aiLd income tax. On this basis, SPA's annual internal cash
generation would be more than enough to cover 1.?5 times its maximum debt
service foreseen during the next several years, as is required in the draft
Loan Agreement.
24.       The SPA would be required to earn a financial rate of return on
its overall net fixed assets in operation of 5 percent in 1975, 6 percent
in 1976 and 7 percent in 1977 and thereafter. The SPAl also intends to earn
these same rates of return separately at Kota Kinabalu and Sandakan. In
addition, it intends to review future staffing at the minor ports to
minimize the cost of supervisory staff, when they come under its authority,
and intends to ensure to the extent possible that these minor ports and Labuan
will break even financially on wharf operations. No difficulty is expected
in its achieving these objectives.
25.       Faster ship turn-around and lower cargo-handling costs will be
the main economic benefits of the project, and these will yield an internal
economic return of 18 percent for the port at Kota Kinabalu and 41 percent
for the one at Sandakan.
PART III - LEGAL INSTRWUMTS AND AUTHORITY
26.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the SPA, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between Malaysia and the Bank, a draft letter agreement
from the State of Sabah, the Report of the Committee provided for in
Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of
a Resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately. The draft Loan and Guarantee Agreements



- 6 -
contain provisions usual for this type of project, while the draft letter
agreement from the State of Sabah contains assurances from the State with
respect to matters within its jurisdiction.
27.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART IV - RECOHMEMIDATION
28.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
