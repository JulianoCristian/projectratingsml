The project includes: (i) Road and Bridge\n            Component: reconstruction or upgrading of five road sections\n            in the Northern Plain totalling about 54 km and of about 13\n            km in the Southwest; construction of new bridges to replace\n            the Hyppolite and Trois Rivieres bridges, and preinvestment\n            studies of high priority projects in the transport sector.\n            (ii) Coastal Shipping Ports Component: construction of\n            coastal shipping port facilities at Port-au-Prince, Jeremie\n            and Port-de-Paix. The project would also include 485\n            man/months of technical assistance for design work,\n            supervision of construction, management advisory services\n            and studies. The project would benefit about 900,000\n            persons, mostly low-income rural inhabitants."}, "docdt": "1978-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
