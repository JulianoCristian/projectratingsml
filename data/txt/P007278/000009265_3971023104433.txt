FIFTH TRANSPORT PROJECT (CREDIT 807-HA)
PROJECT CONPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
The following is a Project Completion Report on the Haiti Fifth Transport
Project, for which Credit 807-HA, in the amount of US$15.0 million, was
approved by the Executive Directors on May 18, 1978. The Credit is 99%
disbursed and the remaining funds are expected to be disbursed by the
estimated closing datz of June 30, 1983.
This Completion Report was prepared by the Bank's Latin America and the
Caribbean Regional Office and is based on information obtained from the files
of LAC Information Center, Minutes ef the Board Meeting, Appraisal and
Supervision Reports, information gathered by the Bank staff completion
missions that visited Haiti in September and October of 1982, and from a
final report prepared by the Autorite Portuaire National on the port element
of the project.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance audit
reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff.
The draft report was sent to the Borrower for comments; however, none
were received.

FIFTH TRANSPORT PROJECT (CREDIT 807-HA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
The Fifth Transport Project (Credit 807-HA) achieved its main
objectives of upgrading 54 km of roads in the Northern Plain Area,
replacing two bridges and improving three pilot coastal shipping ports
to test the capability of the Port-au-Prince Authority (APP) of
extending its role to the smaller ports.
The Project was implemented at a total cost In line with the appraisal
estimate (para 4.01) and with a time overrun of about a year, caused
mainly by the delays in (a) com.?leting the construction of the ports
(para 3.08) and (b) upgrgding the Limonade-Trou du Nord Road Section
(para 3.05).
The economic reevaluation confirms the probable viability of most of
the road and bridge works included in the project (para 5.04).   How-
ever, in the case of the three ports, a meaningful economic reevaluation
can take place only when the whole system of coastal shipping ports
being developed under Credit 1121-HA is in place and related support
services to the merchant fleet become effective (para 5.05).
The Project Completion Report identifies, as a lesson to be learned
from this project, the need for tight supervision of project imple-
mentation (para 8.02), since most of the road construction deficiencies
(para 3.04) could have been avoided by timely intervention of the
consultants in charge of the supervision (para 3.07).

FIFTH TRANSPORT PROJECT (CREDIT 807-HA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Haiti's island location, its rugged terrain, its dominant
coastline, the dispersion of its agricultural production and the importance
of its capital city, Port-au-Prince, are of particular significance to its
transport sector. In external trade, about 982 of Haiti's freight tonnage is
moved by sea, with the balance by air or over land to the Dominican
Republic. Up to the 1950s, a significant amount of Haiti's exports moved
directly through a number of small coastal ports. As international shipping
patterns changed, encouraging centralization, Port-au-Prince became the major
international shipping center, handling 90% of the country's general cargo
imports and exports. While important tonnages are also handled at
specialized private terminals elsewhere (e.g., bauxite, petroleum products,
cement and wheat), the concentration of general cargo trade at one port has a
major impact on internal transport demand. International passenger traffic
is now b7 air, and by tourist ships, which bring important numbers of one-day
visitors, mostly to Port-au-Prince and Cap-Haitien.
1.02      Internal transport moves primarily by land and is largely
concentrated on a few recently reconstructed primary roads which form the
backbone of the transport system. Coastal shipping accounts for 18% of
domestic freight tonnage and 10% of domestic passenger movements. Domestic
air travel is light, primarily serving tourists and a limited local market of
Government officials and business. Haiti's road network deteriorated
drastically during the 1960s because road maintenance was neglected;
as a result, provincial centers became isolated from one another and from the
capital. Since 1971, the Government has recognized the importance of
transport to the level of economic activity and has undertaken the
reconstruction of the basic road network.
1.03      Bank Group involvement in Haiti's transport sector began with a
Bank Highway Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project (Loan 141-HA, US$2.6
million, 1956) which involved about 1,000 km of roads. The second operation
(Credit 32-HA, US$350,000, 1962) was an Interim Highway Project to complete
works undertaken in the first project. The third and fourth operations
(Credit 478-HA, US$10 million, 1974 and Credit 556-HA, US$20 million, 1975)
included a UNDP-financed National Transport Study, reconstruction of the
Northern Road and rehabilitation of major bridges. The subject of this
completion report, the Fifth Transport Credit, has been followed by two
ongoing transport projects: the Port DevelE m:aJt Project (Credit 1121-HA,
US$11 million, 1981) for the construction of port facilities at Cap Haitien
and the construction and rehabilitation of terminal facilities in seven
coastal shipping ports; and the Sixth Highway Project (Credit 1220-HA,



US$14 million, 1982) for the rehabilitation and strengthening of 100 km of
the Northern Road, the rehabilitation of 57 bridges and various drainage
structures, and technical assistance for institution-building in the
subsector.
1.04      This completion report is based on information obtained from the
files of the LAC Information Center, Minutes of the Board Meeting, Appraisal
and Supervision reports for Credit 807-HA, consultant's reports, information
gathered by completion missions that visited Haiti in September and October
of 1982, and a final report prepared by the Authorite Portuaire National on
the port element of the project.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION, APPRAISAL AND NEGOTIATIONS
2.01      The elements of the road and bridge components of the Fifth
Transport Project (Map IBRD 13293R (PCR)) were selected from a priority list
established by Haiti's 1977 National Transport Study (NTS) 1/. This list
included: (a) the rehabilitation and upgrading of the road network serving
the northern plain east of Cap-Haitien (50 ku) as it supported ongoing
agricultural development projects; (b) improvement of the first 23 km of the
road to Port de Paix (from Carrefour Joffre, on the Northern Road, to Gros
Morne) to support the Trois Rivieres Valley development; and (c) improvement
of roads linking secondary ports with their immediate hinterland in the
framework of a program for the development of coastal shipping.
2.02      A French-Haitian joint venture of consultant firms was retained on
February 1977 under the Fourth Highway Project (Credit 556-HA) to carry out
feasibility studies for the Northern Plain roads (54 km), the Gros Horne road
(23 km) and the access roads to the ports of Jeremie and Port de Paix
(3.9 km). The study, completed in September 1977, provided the basis to
determine the length and scope of the economically justified improvements.
Upgrading of 54 km of roads in the Northern Plain area, together with the
replacement of the Trois Rivieres Bridge on the road to Gros Morne and
upgrading of the first section of the access road to Jeremie, was retained in
the project. In September 1977, the scope of the study was extended to
include economic assessment and engineering for the reconstruction of the
Hyppolite Bridge, which collapsed in August 1972 2/. The high incidence of
bridge failures and the critical importance of river crossings in maintaining
access to regions and rural communities prompted inclusion under the project
of a study for the preparation of a countrywide program for bridge
reconstruction and rehabilitation.
1/ The Study, financed by a UNDP grant (US$600,000), was carried out by US
consultants during the period 1975-1977, with the Bank acting as executing
agency.
2/ Completed in mid-1978, after appraisal.

2.03      The study also concluded that projected volumes of traffic in
coastal shipping would justify investment in port improvements and in
modernization of the fleet; to accommodate the expected traffic, it proposed
the improvement of port facilities at 19 coastal locations. As a result of
discussions of the study's findings and recommendations between the
Government and the Bank in February 1977, it was agreed to proceed with a
pilot project in coastal shipping port development to test APP 3I capability
of extending its role to the smaller ports. Port-au-Prince, Jeremie, and
Port-de-Paix were selected for initial terminal improvement since they were
considered to be of key importance to the future development of coastal
shipping.
2.04      To prepare the pilot ports compoment of the project, the Government
retained the same firm that prepared the feasibility studies for the Northern
Plain roads (para 2.02) for an engineering and economic study. A US firm was
contracted for an organization and financial study to provide recommendations
on (a) the institutional arrangements to be made by APP for implementation
and operation of ports included in the project and (b) the structure and
level of user charges for the port terminals. Financing for these studies
was provided under the Fourth Highway Project (Credit 556-HA). It was also
decided that the project would include management advisory services to APP to
provide assistance in the implementation of recommendations made in the
above-mentioned organization and financial study, as well as a Coastal
Shipping Development Study leading to the identification and preparation
of future port projects, the definition of the coastal shippng fleet
development best suited for conditions prevailing in Haiti, and a feasibility
study for an international port terminal at Cap-Haitien.
2.05      The project was appraised in October 1977.  Since the appraisal
mission's recommendations did not differ substantially from the approach
agreed within the Bank prior to appraisal, no Decision Meeting was held, and
a combined Issues Paper/Decision Memorandum was issued on December 16, 1977.
It highlighted the following:
(a) Transport Investment Policy: the Government had not fully
complied with the covenants of Credit 556-HA calling for the
formulation of a transport investment plan for the period
1977-1981, although a de facto plan existed as a result of
international and bilateral agencies following the
recommendations of the NTS concerning investment priorities.
It was agreed that, during negotiations, the Government should
undertake to prepare and adopt, after consultation with the
Association, a five-year transport investment program for the
period 1979-1983, and should update the program annually. This
was later translated into covenants in the Credit Agreement.
31 Autorite Portuaire Port-au-Prince, later converted to the Autorite
Portuaire Nationale (APN).

(b) Financial Plan for Coastal Shipping Ports: since most of the
population of the rural areas to be served by coastal shipping
under the pilot project were at the absolute poverty level, It
was felt important to charge users, as a starting point, only
enough to cover operation and maintenance costs. It was
therefore agreed that IDA accept rate structures based on such
minimum requirements, provided that (i) the Government would
give a one-time equity contribution for the construction of the
coastal shipping ports during 1978-1979 and (ii) port charges
would be revised annually to keep in line with inflation.  It
was decided that the obligations of APP should be defined in a
Project Agreement and that the Government of Haiti should have
a Supplementary Agreement with APP, providing for on-lending of
credit amounts at 0.75% interest for a period of 25 years,
including a six-year grace period.
2.06      Negotiations were conducted in Washington between the 5th and the
14th of April1 1978, and a credit of US$15 million equivalent was approved by
the Executive Directors on May 18, 1978.

III. PROJECT IHPLENENTATION
Roads and Bridges
3.01      Works for roads and bridges were divided into four lots as follows:
I. North Plain Roads 41
II. Trois Rivieres Bridge
III.Marche Leon Access Road
IV. Hyppolite Bridge
Bids were received oa November 15, 1978, and awards to the lowest bidders
were announced on December 15, 1978. Lots I, II and IV were awarded to a
French contractor, while Lot III was awarded to a local firm. The Government
elected not to use the 15Z preference for local firms. Contracts for civil
works were signed on January 19, 1979, and notice to proceed was given on
February 5, 1979.
3.02      At the time of appraisal, a paved road was foreseen on the entire
54 km comprising Lot I. However, because of past experience with high
contract costs in Haiti, bids included a provision for an alternative design
for gravel surface on the Lilonade-Trou du Nord road section (10 km), in case
the cost of paving the entire 54 km would exceed the amount of funds
available for the upgrading of Lot I. Contractors' bid prices were below
appraisal estimates, and, in July 1979, the Government requested, and IDA
agreed, to the paving of the 10-km road section. A contract's clause
however, allowed the contractor to renegotiate unit prices should the
variance of quantities zxceed 15%. Since there was an increase in quantities
on the work performed on Lots I, II, and IV, the work on the Limonade-Trou du
Hord section would exceed the 15% limit, and the contractor insisted that
unit prices be revised for the entire contract. TPTC 5/ did not agree to
4/ Lot I included originally the following road sections:
(a) Cap-Haitien-Carrefour La Mort (7.3 km)
(b) Carrefour La Mort-Limonade (7.0 km)
(c) Limonade-Trou du Nord (13.0 km)
(d) Carrefour La Morte-Barriere Battante (9.0 km)
(e) Barriere Battante-Grande Riviere du Nord (11.3 km)
(f) Barriere Battante-Milot (2.8 km)
(g) Plain du Nord-Northern Road (3.5 km)
5/ Ministry of Public Works, Transportation and Communications.



renegotiate the basic contract's unit prices for work already done and
decided to invite new bids for the construction of the Limonade-Trou du Nord
road section, which became Lot V.
3.03      Construction of Lots I, II and IV was completed and provisionally
accepted by the Government at various dates between March and August 1980,
averaging about one month behind schedule. The slight delays were mostly
related to heavy rains during March 1979 and the ensuing changes in drainage
design prompted by those rains 6J. Final acceptance of the lots was due one
year after their provisional acceptance. In April 1982, the Government gave
final acceptance for Lot IV but declined to accept Lots I and II until the
contractor had carried out the necessary repairs to pavement, shoulders and
other road appurtenances in compliance with his contractual obligations. The
contractor complied, and the Government will give final acceptance for both
lots on May 31, 1983.   The total cost of upgrading the 41 km of the Northern
Plain roads included in Lot I was US$6,303,285, or US$153,787 per km. The
total costs of replacing the Trois Rivieres Bridge (Lot II) and the Hyppolite
Bridge (Lot IV) were US$1,067,319 and US$1,410,092 respectively.
3.04      Lot III was completed and provisionally accepted by the Government
in July 1980, with almost two months delay due to the heavy rains of March
1979 (para 3.03) and to increased earthwork quantities because the road was
widened from 5.0 m to 6.0 o. The final cost of thls element of the project
was US$1,466,370 (US$114,560 per ki).
3.05      Construction of Lot V (Limonade-Trou du Nord) vas contracted by the
Government with a US-Haitian consortium on August 13, 1980. The contractor
was given authorization to proceed on August 21, 1980, with completlon of
works scheduled for March 1981. Works were provisionally accepted by the
Government in April 1982, a year later than expected, and final acceptance
will be given on May 27, 1983. Delays were due to the contractor's late
mobilization, requests by TPTC to modify some original drainage designs and
tardy approval of proposed work order changes by the supervision consultants,
difficulties with customs clearances, and problem with the delivery of
bitumen by oil companies. The final cost of this road sectlon was
US$2,080,000 (US$148,571 per am).
3.06      The final cost of the roads and brldges elements of the project was
US$12.40 million, or 72 below the appraisal estimate of US$13.34 million
(including physical and price contingencies). The savlang brought about by
the Improvement of the Northern Plain roads, at a cost of 142 below the
appraisal estimate of US$9,561,800, and the replacement of the Hyppollte
Bridge, at a final cost of 462 below the appraisal estimate of US$2,063,500.
6/ These included (i) raising of portlons of the road grade at some
locations and construction of additional culverts, and (11) the
construction of two bridges and a box culvert on the road connecting the
Trois Rivieres Bridge to the North Road, at points where traffic was
interrupted due to flooding.



were partly offset by the cost overruns experienced by the replacement of the
Trois Rivieres Bridge and the improvement of the Marche Leon access road. In
the case of the Trois Rivieres Bridge, the final cost was 7Z above the
appraisal estimate of US$1,000,200, while, for the Marche Leon access road,
the widening of the road bed (para 3.04) resulted in a final cost 105% above
the appraisal estimate of US$714,500.
3.07      Construction supervision was carried out by a joint venture of
French-Haitian consultants supported by TPTC's Construction Service and
National Laboratory staff. The consultants provided both off-site and
on-the-job training to the local engineers and technical support staff
assigned to the project. Overall performance of the supervision team was
below expectations. Had the foreign consultants spent more time on the
project site, many of the construction deficiencies (para 3.03) could have
been avoided by timely intervention. The final cost of supervision was
US$1.4 million, 16% more than estimated at appraisal. It represents 9% of
the total cost of the civil works. The cost of supervision, although
reasonable, was higher than estimated at appraisal, largely because the
consultants services had to be extended until the completion of Lot V
(para 3.05).
Coastal Ports
3.08      Contracts for the construction of the three pilot ports were
awarded to the lowest bidder, a firm from the Dominican Republic. Civil
works started in March 1979, three months behind schedule (mainly because of
slow legal procedures in contract awards) and were satisfactorily completed
between January 1981 and January 1982, an average of a year after appraisal
estimate of June 1980. The reasons for the delays in construction were:
(a) hurricane damages in the Dominican Republic and in Haiti which
affected the contractor's performance;
(b) serious delays in granting of permission to use dynamite in
quarries, which caused total stoppage of construction of the
Port of Jeremie for several weeks;
(c) problems between the contractor and his trucking subcontractor;
and
(d) supplementary construction at the Port of Jeremie.
3.09      The design of the original construction contract for the Port of
Jeremie assumed a maximum wave height of 1.5 m. Subsequent observations
estimated waves of 2.0 m, and, on that basis, the firm in charge of the
supervision recommended changes in the design of the slope protection. A
separate contract was negotiated with the firm already in charge of the ports
construction to carry out the supplementary works at an estimated cost of
about US$400,000. Works were completed in October 1981. Supplementary
financing was provided by Credit 1121-HA.



- 8 -
3.10      Total cost of construction (excluding engineering) of the three
coastal ports was US$3,997,228, or 19Z above the appraisal estimate of
US$3,349,000. The higher cost resulted principally from the supplementary
works carried out in the Port of Jeremie (para 3.09) and from additional
works required to repair Port de Paix after a slope failure.
Coastal Shipping Study
3.11      Concurrently with the initiation of terminal development at the
three pilot ports, a two-phase Coastal Shipping Development Study (CSDS) was
undertaken, as part of the project, to assist the Government in defining a
program for development of Haiti's coastal shipping system in the next
decade. A US firm was retained to carry out the study. During 1979, Phase I
of the CSDS, for which the Bank acted as UNDP's executing agency, reviewed
all existing coastal ports and fleet operations, prepared traffic projections
and developed and evaluated alternative systems solutions. This operation
resulted in recommendations to support the development of a regularly
scheduled service by modernized motor vessels among 11 coastal ports (the
three pilot ports, Cap-Haitien and seven others) and to supplement the
motorized service by improved feeder services of conventional sailboats to.
and from smaller communities. The total cost of this phase of the Study was
US$160,000.
3.12      Phase II of the CSDS, financed by IDA, was initiated in late 1979
and completed in September 1980 at a cost in line with the appraisal estimate
of US$500,000. It consisted of preliminary engineering designs, economic
analysis and financial forecasts for port terminal developments at the
following Ports : Gonaives, Anse a Galets, Baraderes, Corail, Anse
d'Hainault, Port-a-Piment and Les Cayes. This phase of the CSDS provided the
basis for appraisal of the coastal shipping ports component of Credit
1121-HA.
Cap-Haitien Port Study
3.13      The project also included financing for the preparation of a
long-range port development plan for Cap-Haitien and a feasibility study for
the first phase of the recommended construction. To undertake this work, APN
selected a French consulting firm, which, in 1979, surveyed existing
conditions, assessed alternative development schemes and recommended a
program of port Improvements, which was discussed with representatives of the
local commnity and APN officials. Upon general agreement regarding the
recommended ports development program, the consultants prepared preliminary
engineering designs, economic and financial analysis and a final report on
the next stage of port development, which constitutes the major part of the
project financed under Credit 1121-HA. The final cost of the study was
US$545,722, or 9Z below the appraisal estimate of US$600,000.



-9-
Management Advisory Services to APN
3.14      The same consultants who carried out the CSDS were retained to
provide Management Advisory Services to APN. The main objective of the
Services was to assict APN in adopting the variatm recommendations of the
'Organization and Financial Study" - March 1978 (financed under Credit
556-HA) for the management and operation of the coastal shipping ports and,
particularly, to design appropriate accounting, budgeting and management
procedures.
3.15      The consultants commenced their work in February 1979 and were
expected to complete their assignment in August 1980. Their services were
extended until February 1981, mainly because training of personnel in the
newly designed system was postponed so that it could immediately precede the
opening of the pilot ports. The two-month long training program, attended by
twelve APN employees, was completed in December-1980. To prepare the
trainees for the actual work on the coastal services, the activities were
practical-situation-oriented. Then, operation of the pilot ports and of the
Coastal Ports Department was simulated for a three month period, and the
trainees were exposed to different work phases. The program was successful:
in addition to the training aspect, it demonstrated that the new procedures
are soundly designed and that the various new manuals suitably assist staff
in the administration of the coastal services. The final cost of this
technical assistance was US$285,000 compared with the appraisal estimate of
US$290,000.
3.16      Different accounting systems are used in Port-au-Prince and in Cap-
Haitien.  Since the accounting system developed under the Management Advisory
Services for the coastal shipping pilot ports is expected to provide more
meaningful information for management control, the system is being extended
to other coastal shipping ports being constructed under the Port Development
Project (Credit 1121-HA) as they become operational under APN's jurisdiction.
Credit 1121-HA provides financing for a variety of technical assistance
services required by APN in the development of its program.
Bridge Rehabilitation Program
3.17      The project financed an engineering/economic study to review the
problem of bridges and structures in Haiti and to recommend a five-year
program for the rehabilitation and repairs of the existing bridges and the
construction of new bridges, box culverts and concrete fords. The study was
carried out by a German consulting firm which started work in June 1980 and
presented its draft report in January 1981. A total of some 350 different
drainage structures, of which 100 were bridges, were inspected and
evaluated. Only 19 bridges were found in good condition; 31 required minor
repairs and 35 intensive repairs; 15 bridges needed to be replaced. The
study, completed at a total cost of US$665,000, served to identify the
program being carried out under the Sixth Highway Project (Credit 1220-HA).
Pavement Rehabilitation and Strengthening Program
3.18      Preparation of a Pavement Rehabilitation and Strengthening Program
was carried out by a French-Haitian joint venture that was contracted on



- 10 -
December 15, 1980. The consultants prepared a detailed technical economic
study on some 553 km of paved roads, including the Northern Road (Port-au-
Prince to Cap-Haitien, 250 ki), the Southern Road (Port-au-Prince to Cayes,
180 km); the Jacmel Road (connecting the Southern Road to Jacmel, 43 km), the
Mirabalais Road (connecting Mirabalais to Port-au-Prince, 50 km) and the
Ganthier Road from (Croix de Bouquets to Fond Parisien, 29 km). The study
was completed on May 25, 1981 at a total cost of US$303,000 and served as the
basis for the ongoing Sixth Highway Project. Total cost for both the Bridge
Rehabilitation (para 3.16) and the Pavement Rehabilitation and Strengthening
Studies was US$968,000 or 94% above the appraisal estimate of US$500,000.
The higher-than-expected final cost was mainly due to the fact that final
engineering of the subprojects selected to be financed under Credit 1220-HA
was carried out as part of these studies; this had not been envisaged at the
time of appraisal.
IV. COST ESTIMATES AND DISBURSEMENTS
4.01      A summary comparison between appraisal estimates and final costs is
shown in Table 1. The final total cost of the project was US$20.8 million,
about 2% over the appraisal estimate of US$20.47 million, including
contingencies. The substantial cost overruns in the engineering and
supervision of the civil works as well as in the pre-investment studies for
roads and bridges, due to the expanded scope of work, were mostly offset by
the 10% below appraisal estimate of the final cost of the civil works on road
and bridges.
4.02      The allocation of credit funds was revised once, as shown in the
following tabulation, to distribute the unallocated funds among the different
credit categories.

4.03      As shown below, disbursement lagged behind appraisal estimates from
the start, mainly because of delays in constructing the ports. Disbursements
against civil works and consultants' services, originally set at 72% and 802
respectively, were changed to 60X at the time of loan funds reallocation to
permit the Bank participation until project completion. The Closing Date was
extended three times, from the original of December 31, 1981 to June 30,
1982, then to December 31, 1982, and finally to June 30, 1983.

V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
Roads and Bridges
5.01      The ex-post economic evaluation of the roads and bridges in the
project is based on the methodology used at the time of appraisal. It
comprises an analysis of quantifiable benefits, including savings in vehicle
operating costs, reduced travel distance, savings in road maintenance cost
and users' time savings (estimated separately). Benefits vere calculated on
the basis of the latest available vehicle operating costs for Haiti and base
year traffic counts carried out in December, 1982 by the Secretariat of
Public Works, Transport and Communications. Because of the Secretariat's
budgetary difficulties, recent traffic counts on the Marche Leon access road
and the Trois Riviere Bridge could not be obtained 8/.
5.02      An estimation of the probable economic merits of the Trois Riviere
Bridge was carried out using traffic counts taken on the Gonaives-Gros Morne
road during mid-1981 for the appraisal of the Sixth Highway Project.
However, no data were available for the reevaluation of the 12.8-km Marche
Leon access road. Because of its isolated location, the gathering of data on
agricultural production in the area of influence of the road represented a
task beyond the Ministry's present capabilities.
7/ As of April 22, 1983, about US$183,000 of credit funds were still
undisbursed.
8/ The adequacy of the Ministry's collection of traffic data is being
addressed under the Sixth Highway Project. At negotiations of Credit
1121-HA, the Government agreed to carry out traffic counts thrice annually
on selected points nationwide, and locally when requested.



- 12 -
5.03      Table 2 summarizes the principal indicators of the economic
evaluation. Average annual traffic growth during the period 1979-1982
--except for Carrefour La Mort-Limonade, Carrefour-La Morte-Barriere Battante
and the Hypolite Bridge- was less than expected at appraisal. Projected
traffic growth for the economic reevaluation, therefore, was estimated using
more conservative rates, except in the case of the Cap-Raitien-Carrefour La
Mort road section, where planned Improvements to the Port of Cap-Haitien will
most likely help the traffic growth expected at the time of appraisal to
materialize. The underlying assumption for the still substantial projected
traffic growth is that it is starting from a very low base, and, since Haiti
is experiencing an important shift from animal to motor vehicle transport
which is taking place even with the decline of ecomomic activity in the last
two years, projections based solely on the income elasticity of demand for
transport would be inappropriate.
5.04      As shown in Table 2, the reestimated IRRs confirm the probable
economic viability of the subprojects, except for the Plain du Nord-Northern
Road Section, for which a first year benefit of about 6% suggests that the
improvement of that road might have been premature. The results of the
economic reevaluation of the Carrefour-La Mort-Barriere Battante, Barriere
Battante-Grand Riviere du Nord, and Barriere Battante-Milot require some
qualifications. For these three road sections, only aggregated cost figures
were available; pro-rating costs on the basis of kilometers probably
underestimates the cost of the Barriere Battante-Milot road section and
overestimates the cost of the other two subprojects. The use of actual
economic costs for each road section would most likely reduce the IRR of
Barriere-Battante-Milot and increase that of Carrefour la Mort-Barriere
Battante and Barriere Battante-Grand Flviere du Nord.
Coastal Shipping Ports
5.05      The objectives of the coastal shipping ports component of the
project were stated as the modernization of three coastal ports and related
institutional measures as an initial step to develop more fully the potential
of coastal shipping" (para 5.01 of SAR). In view of APN's success in
expanding its role to the three pilot ports and, through the ongoing work
under Credit U121-RA, to eight additional ports, it appears that these
objectives have been met. The success or failure of the longer range
objective to develop a coastal shipping system for Haiti can be evaluated
only after the eleven ports financed under Credit 1121-HA have been completed
and related support services to the merchant fleet have become effective.
Therefore, a meaningful evaluation of the economic impact of coastal shipping
development in Haiti should take place not earlier than 1986.
5.06      For the purpose of this report, a quantified evaluation of the
coastal ports component of the project was carried out, based, as in the
project appraisal, on the folloing expected benefits:
(a) difference in cargo handling cost;
(b) improved protection to ships and cargo;
(c) improved passenger handling;
(d) reduced transit time for cargo (Jeremie); and
(e)  reduced road distance to city center (Port-au-Prince).



- 13 -
The analysis was performed only for the ports of Jeremie and Port-au-Prince
since the available data were insufficient for evaluating the Port-de-Paix
subproject. The economic reevaluation of the ports of Jeremie and
Port-au-Prince yielded estimated IRRs of 9% and 7% respectively, versus
appraisal estimates of 132 and 13.72. These estimates, however, should not
be regarded as firm since the data base from which they were derived is very
weak. Although coastal traffic in the last two years seem to have
experienced a downturn, recorded traffic substantially underestimates actual
traffic, possibly by as much as 50%. Furthermore, as discussed in paragraph
5.05, these ports should be evaluated as part of an integrated coastal
shipping program at a later date.
VI. PERFORMANCE OF THE BORROWER AND EXECUTING AGENCY
6.01      The performance of the Borrower in relation to the compliance of
the covenants included in the Credit and Project Agreements has been mixed.
As obligated by those Agreements, the Borrower:
(a) prepared, and is implementing, a program of work in connection
with transport planning (Section 4.02 of the Credit
Agreement);
(b)  adopted a revised program for investment in the transport
sector for the period 1981-1982 a,od developed a five-year plan
for 1981-1986 (Section 4.03 of the Credit Agreement);
(c) provided adequate maintenance of the North Road (financed
under Credits 478-HA and 556-HA) and implemented the annual
physical work program for road maintenance for 1977-1981. A
1982-1986 maintenance program was prepared by TPTC and
reviewed by the Association (Section 4. 4 (a) and (b) of the
Credit Agreement); and
(d) revalued the fixed assets of APN and furnished the latter's
annual budgets for the Association's comments (Section 4.03
and 4.05 of the Project Agreement).
6.02      What follows discusses those covenants, compliance with which is
still pending:
Section 3.02 (d) of the Credit Agreement: "The Borrower shall make available
to the APN promptly as needed the equivalent of US$1,100,000 in the form of
equity and the equivalent of US$120,000 as a grant for the carrying out of
the ports element of the project".

The Borrower, because of financial difficulties did not make the funds
available to APN as intended. This, together with APN's inability to collect
some client's debts on time and the Government's further appropriation of
some of the port revenues, has resulted in a serious cash deficiency that
increased APN's bank overdraft and the consequent increase in interest
payments.
Section 4.05 of the Credit Agreement: "The Borrower shall take all measures
necessary to ensure at all times the enforcement of regulations requiring
that the dimensions and axle loads of the vehicles using its roads not exceed
limits consistent with the structural and geometric design standards of such
roads..."
Compliance with this covenant is expected to be realized under the Sixth
Highway Project (Credit 1220-HA). The ongoing program has been hampered by
frequert breakdowns of weighbridge equipment. Replacement of old equipment
is being financed by the Association under Credit 1220-HA. A new law
defining levels of fines for overloaded vehicles was enacted in December
1982.
Section 4.06 (c) of the Credit Agreement..."ensure that the charges collected
by APN from the operation of the ports included in part C of the Project
remain adequate to achieve the working and operating ratios specified in
Section 4.06 of the Project Agreement..."
An analysis of coastal shipping tariffs is to be initiated as soon as some
experience has been gained in the operation of the three pilot ports; data on
these ports are being collected, but it is still too early to draw specific
conclusions about the impact of user charges on port usage. APN's records
reveal that the present income from the three pilot ports (plus the existing
terminal of Cite Simone) barely covers APN's operating cost, but questions
have been raised on the accuracy of tonnage and passenger records being kept.
Section 4.04 of the Project Agreement: "The APN shall promptly establish and
maintain cost accounting procedures satisfactory to the Association."
Under IDA Credit 1121-HA, consultancy assistance was provided to develop
uniform accounting systems for APN's entire operation. As part of the
consultants' work, cost accounting will be further developed to ensure that
cost center related information, budget comparison, etc., become a tool of
port management to analyze and direct port operations. The consultants, who
began work on November 16, 1981, have now installed the new system.
Section 4.08 of the Project Agreement: 'Ensure that the charges collected by
the APN remain adequate to earn an annual rate of return of at least 6%."
An average tariff increase of about 8%, based on a consultants' tariff study
completed in 1981, was put into effect in January 1982. However, the
covenant's objective of earning a 6% rate of return on average net assets was
not attained in 1982 because of the late application of the new tariffs and
the considerable shortfall in import traffic. The 1983 budget addresses this
problem both through cost-cutting measures and a possible further adjustment
in tariffs. However, tariff increases are encountering rising criticism from
vessels' operators.

6.03      APN, as Executing Agency for the coastal shipping port components
of Credit 807-HA and Credit 1121-HA, has established a new department for
this purpose and is expanding its staff to meet the needs of this function.
In its performance of all work related to the hiring of consultants and
construction contractors for this project, APN has been effective and
diligent, in accordance with the requirements of the Project Agreement.
VII. ROLE OF THE BANK
7.01      The Bank played an active role in the identification and
preparation of the project through its review of, and comments on, the
National Transport Study as well as through the financing of the necessary
economic and engineering studies under the Fourth Highway Project.  The scope
and size of the project were well within the capabilities of the executing
agencies, and completion times allowed for the various project elements were
reasonable.
7.02      Throughout project implementation, the Bank showed an understanding
of the economic and political difficulties inherent in the compliance with
major covenants relating to the ports' financial performance in the context
of a deepening economic recession. However, in the case of the Borrower's
failure to make the equity and grant funds available to APN as originally
envisaged, the Bank might have taken firmer action, especially since there
was a follow-on port development project.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
8.01      The Fifth Transport Project was successfully completed with a
one-year time overrun and at a cost only slightly above that expected at
appraisal. Although the es-post economic evaluation of most of the road
components of the project confirms its justification, the analysis of the
coastal shipping ports element is still preliminary and should be repeated at
at a later time. Furthermore, data collection should be substantially
improved if the results of such analysis are to be kept within a reasonable
margin of error. The technical assistance elements of the project were well
selected and resulted in two follow-on Bank-financed projects, as well as in
a substantial improvement in APN's budgetary reporting.
8.02      Probably the only lesson to be learned from thi8 project is the
need for more intensive supervision of project implementation. In the case
of the road component, several kilometers of road were treated with poor
quality bitumen. On-site supervision could have detected the problem from
the beginning, before it became widespread. However, at one time, no Bank
missions for the road component visited the project for one year. A closer
Bank supervision would have prompted closer supervision by the consultants in
charge of supervising the civil works.
