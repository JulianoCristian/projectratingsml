PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KENYA
COTTON PROCESSING AND MARKETING PROJECT
(CRED)IT 1237-KE)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Cotton Processing and Marketing
Project in Kenya for which Credit 1237-KE in the amount of SDR 18.7 million (US$22 million
equivalent) was approved by IDA in April 1982. The Credit Agreement was signed in March
1983, and became effective on May 31, 1983. The credit closing date was extended from June 30,
1987 to June 30, 1989, except for the technical assistance component which was extended to
June 30, 1991. The last disbursement was made on June 19, 1991 and the account was closed as
of that date. An undisbursed amount of SDR 0.4 million was canceled.
The PCR (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III) was prepared by staff of the
FAO/World Bank Cooperative Program (CP). The Borrower has not submitted Part II.
The report is based on findings of a PCR mission that visited Kenya in June 1991, the
Staff Appraisal Report, Credit and Project agreements, supervision reports, correspondence
between the Bank and the Borrower and internal Bank memoranda.

PROJECT COMIPLETION REPORT
KENYA
COTTON PROCESSING AND MARKETING PROJECT
(CREDIT 1237-KE)
EVALUATION SUNMMARY
Objectives
1.        The original objective of the project was to improve the post-harvest handling of
cotton by improving collection and marketing of seed cotton; rehabilitating and expanding cotton
ginning; and strengthening the technical and financial management of the institutions involved in
processing and marketing. These improvements were expected to induce increases in seed cotton
production and amelioration in the quality of lint. After three years of slow and unsuccessful
implementation, both GOK and IDA concluded that the project as originally designed could not
achieve its objective. At the mid-term review, it was agreed that an overhaul of the industry was
needed. The nature of the project changed from one of investment to adjustment, wit., the
objective of laying the policy and legal framework for a new and deregulated system.
Implementation Experience
2.        The project had a difficult start-up and suffered from  a three-year gap between
appraisal and credit effectiveness. This was due to the delays by GOK in meeting the conditions
for signing and credit effectiveness. The most important one was the Government guarantee to
a consortium of commercial banks to cover the Cotton Lint and Seed Marketing Board's
(CLSMB) working capital requirements. Implementation of the project was slow due to several
reasons. One was low budget provisions by GOK, as well as the tardiness in establishing specific
management roles by the implementing agencies. Anothier reason was the serious financial
position of the CLSMB even after the provision of Ksh 140 million as overdraft facility by the
consortium of banks under the Revolving Credit Agreement. This facility was all utilized within
the first year of the project and was used more like a loan to finance past debts to banks and
farmers, rather than to cover temporary working capital shortfalls. The consortium of banks
refused to renew the facility when it expired in May 1986. The Cooperative Bank of Kenya
(CBK) also refused to provide additional loans to the CLSMI3 and terminated its Subsidiary
Credit Agreement. The inability to borrow by the CLSMB hindered prompt payinenit to ftariners
and was a main disincentive to production. Cotton production, which had started to fall before
the project became effective, continuied to decline.
3.        Mid-Term  Review. At the mid-term review in November 1985, GOK and IDA
decided to reformulate the project. Agreement was reached with GOK that the cotton induistry
should be reorganized by r emoving the monopoly of the CLSMB and commencing the divestiture
of CLSMB's responsibilities to cooperatives and private investors. The reformulation included:
the reallocation of project funds to support CLSMB's financial restructuring; the undertaking of
a study to examine and implement the divestiture program and the promulgation of a new Cotton
Act. It was also decided hat the CLSMB obtain Ksh 270 million as equity capital from GOK.
The amendment diverted SDRs 13.3 million from the capital investment program to the import



- iv -
of agricultural inputs and equipment for the cotton subsector in order to ensure continued IDA
support during the transition period.
4.        Progress After the Mid-Term Review.  The cotton subsector policy paper was
drafted in the form of a Cabinet paper and became the basis for preparing the Cotton Act. In
mid-1988, GOK approved the Cotton Act which reduced the CLSMB to a non-trading regulatory
body, and provided for the elimination of its monopoly. Key studies to implement the new bill,
however, were delayed. The closing date for the technical assistance category of the project was
extended to carry out a cotton pricing and marketing study which included a divestiture plan for
the Cotton Board.
Results
5.        Overall, the project was not successful in achieving its original objectives. Although
it introduced a new system of cotton collection by establishing buying teams, these were
ineffectual for most part of the project period because of delayed payments.  The limited
improvement on ginneries also brought no qualitative change. On the positive side, the failure
of the project as originally designed highlighted the need to restructure the subsector. The project
met the revised objective of laying the groundwork for policy reforms. A new Cotton Act was
promulgated in 1988, and a study was carried out to design a new system for cotton marketing
and processing and to recommend an operational plan to divest the CLSMB of its current
functions, limiting its role to regulatory functions specified under the Cotton Act. However,
follow-on support needs to be provided to help GOK carry out the reforms.
Sustainability
6.        A restructuring of the subsector is necessary to its viability. The monopoly by the
Cotton Board in every aspect of cotton processing and marketing was clearly not sustainable. As
shown by the project, financial injections could only provide temporary and minimal relief. IDA
is now assisting GOK to prepare the Second Agriculture Sector Management Project, which
would include measures to promote private trade in cotton, divestiture of ginneries and
privatization of retail marketing, and reorient the activities of the Cotton Board. In addition,
agronomic research for cotton, which was seriously neglected, is important to increasing and
sustaining production.
Lessons Learned
7.        The lessons learned are summarized as follows:
(a)       A comprehensive analysis of the subsector and its long-term development
is necessary before major investments are made. In this case, the lack of
analytical work before project preparation resulted in a project design that
tackled symptoms and not the fundamental problems of the subsector.
(b)       In the absence of a competitive marketing and pricing structure,
incremental changes alone wou!d not bring improvements to the
subsector. A process of adjustment followed by supporting investments
is needed to make the industry viable in the long term.



- v -
(c)       Project design was overly complex. The financing and organization and
management arrangements were intricate and involved many agencies.
If one chain in the link is missing, the arrangement falls apart.
(d)       The production and supply of raw materials, in this case, cotton, should
not be treated lightly in a marketing and processing project.
(e)       When there is a long gap between appraisal and effectiveness, the
situation should be carefully analyzed before we decide to go ahead with
the project as originally designed.
(f)       Flexibility in project implementation salvaged the project. At the mid-
term review, the project was redesigned into an adjustment operation to
reform  the  subsector.   Follow  up  investments  to  support the
implementation of these reforms are envisaged in the Agriculture Sector
Adjustment 1I Project.  Such a project will only succeed, however,
provided the necessary sustained commitment is obtained from the key
parties concerned, and built into the project design.

Sub-sector                      :           Cotton
Background
1.        Cotton has been considered a minor crop in Kenya because of its limited contribution
to agricultural GDP. It accounted for less than I % throughout the 1970s. Therefore, little
resources were devoted to develop this crop until the mid-1970s. Yet, cotton has been important
for the development of marginal agricultural areas, being one of the few cash crops that small
farmers could grow in these areas. It also supplies the textile industry with raw material, thereby
substituting imports.
2.        As the growing textile industry increased the demand for cotton, the Government of
Kenya (GOK) sought to become self sufficient in cotton, and directed its efforts to boost
production by launching the Cotton Development Program (CDP) in 1975. This program
consisted of increasing producer prices, provision of seeds free of charge and provision of tractor
ploughing and pesticides on interest free credit. Under the stimulus of these measures, the annual
cotton production which had stagnated at about 15,000 tons since the sixties, doubled between
1975 and 1979.
3.        While implementing the CDP, the Government identified a number of constraints and
inefficiencies in ginning, storage, handling and marketing. Hence, as part of the CDP, GOK
prepared a project to address the processing and marketing problems of the cotton sub-sector.
The preparation report, which was finalized in February 1980, with the assistance of the World
Bank Regional Mission in Eastern Africa, was presented by GOK to the World Bank for
financing. The project was appraised by IDA in March/April 1980. Following three follow-up
missions, an appraisal report was completed in April 1982. The project, known as the Cotton
Processing and Marketing Project, was approved by the IDA Board in April in 1982. A Credit
Agreement was signed in March 1983 for the amount of SDR 18.7 million (US$ 22 million), and
became effective on May 31, 1983. (The long lapse between appraisal and effectiveness is
explained in para.10)

Project Objectives and Description
4.        The original objective of the project was to improve the post-harvest handling of
cotton by improving collection and marketing of seed cotton; rehabilitating and expanding cotton
ginning; and strengthening the technical and financial management of the institutions involved in
processing and marketing. These improvements were expected to induce increases in seed cotton
production and amelioration in the quality of lint. To attain this objective, the project was to
finance the following investment activities:
(a)    improving seed cokton buying systems by establishing 36 mobile cotton
buying units;
(b)    providing support for transport operations for seed cotton collection and
marketing, including the purchase of 45 trucks (7.5 tons), 4 trucks (15 tons)
with trailers and 17 two-way radios;
(c)    developing storage facilities for seed cotton and lint, comprising the repair
of 127 village stores (15,000 m2), construction of additional village stores
(3,500 m2) and warehouses for lint and spare part storage (6,850 m2);
(d)    rehabilitation of 5 ginneries, improvement of 4 and construction of one new
ginnery to replace an old ginnery;
(e)    providing technical assistance, audit, legal and management services and
training; and
(f)    supporting the management of the Cotton Lint and Seed Marketing Board
(CLSMB), including provision of adequate working capital, and
strengthening its staff and operations.
5.        After three years of slow and unsuccessful implementation, both GOK and IDA
concluded that the project as originally designed could not achieve its objective. At the mid-term
review, it was agreed that an overhaul of the industry was needed. The nature of the project
changed from one of investment to adjustment, with the objective of laying the policy and legal
framework for a new and deregulated system.
Project Design and Organization
6.        The project was not well-prepared. There was no comprehensive analysis of Kenya's
cotton subsector and its future development, and the entire project preparation time of 10.9
staffweeks was about a third of the norm. The project was prepared by GOK with the guidance
of the Bank's regional office in Nairobi. The inadequate analysis of the subsector led to a faulty
project design that tackled the symptoms and not the fundamental problems. Project designers
failed to question the existing structure of the cotton industry. At the time of appraisal, cotton
was the one of the most tightly controlled agricultural commodities in Kenya, a situation arising
from the marketing monopoly of CLSMB which was established under the Cotton Lint and Seed
Marketing Act of 1955. Seed cotton prices were also administered. The Bank did not question
the inherent inefficiencies in an uncompetitive system until halfway through the project, when the
weaknesses of the structure became apparent.



- 3 -
7.        The organization and management arrangements for the project, which were designed
around the status quo, were complex. The responsibility for implementing the improvement of
cotton buying, transport and ginning was assigned to the CLSMB and the cooperative societies;
while improvement and expansion of ginnery storage and warehouses, training, monitoring and
evaluation as well as CLSMB's institutional strengthening were assigned to the CLSMB. The
MOCD was responsible for strengthening the Ministry's services to cooperatives (which included
training) and the CBK for facilitating financial services. A Project Coordinating and Steering
Committee (PCSC), to consist of heads of the implementing agencies plus the Ministries of
Finance and Agriculture, was to ensure project coordination, approve annual work plans and
budgets and resolve major issues. In addition to its complexity, the project neglected assigning
specific responsibilities for carrying out the day-to-day work for each project activity, which
would make each agency accountable for the planning, initiation, budgeting, execution and
supervision of project works.  The failure to clearly identify the specific tasks by the
implementing institutions often led to the obfuscation of the tasks. In retrospect, assigning clear
responsibilities to each institution, ensuring that staffing was adequate for implementation, and
appointing a full time project coordinator would have expedited project implementation.
8.        The financing arrangement was also complex and involved many agencies, with high
risks of delay and failure. According to the Development Credit Agreement, GOK was to onlend
US$21.1 million to CBK, which in turn was to onlend to the cooperatives and the CLSMB. At
the same time, the CLSMB was to obtain a revolving line of credit from a consortium of
commercial banks. The project financing arrangements were governed by seven agreements (para
32). This setting often resulted in lengthy discussions and procedural difficulties between
agencies. When a part of this arrangement was delayed, the entire project was affected. The
lack of working capital for the CLSMB resulted in late payments to farmers for their seed cotton,
thus frustrating and discouraging producers.
9.        Another design flaw was that the project had assumed a continuous expansion of
cotton production as a result of the project's improved processing and marketing efforts, although
no production component was being supported. Project formulation focused on investment in
processing and marketing, leaving the production factors to other Government programs.
However, this assumption was not correct and production had already started to decline during
project preparation and appraisal (Annex 1). Once production of cotton declined, the very project
objectives of rehabilitating and expanding cotton processing facilities as well as improving the
distribution and marketing were compromised.
Project Implementation
10.       General. The project had a difficult start-up and suffered from a three-year gap
between appraisal and credit effectiveness. This was due to the delays by GOK in meeting the
conditions for signing and credit effectiveness. The most important one was the Government
guarantee to a consortium of commercial banks to cover CLSMB's working capital requirements.
Further processing of the project was expedited only after the Bank indicated that it would initiate
actions to withdraw IDA's financing, if the conditions were not met by January 31, 1983. In the
meantime, cotton production continued to fall.
11.      Implementation of the project was slow due to several reasons. One was low budget
provisions by GOK, as well as the tardiness in establishing specific management roles by the
implementing agencies. The role of who should procure equipment for cooperative ginneries was



-4 -
resolved only in 1984, while the envisaged monitoring and evaluation system was introduced only
at the end of 1985, impeding the collection of data on the project and its performance.
12.       Another reason was the serious financial position of the CLSMB even after the
provision of Ksh 140 million as overdraft facility by the consortium of banks under the Revolving
Credit Agreement. This facility was all utilized within the first year of the project and was used
more like a loan to finance past debts to banks and farmers, rather than to cover temporary
working capital shortfalls. The consortium of banks, therefore, refused to renew the facility when
it expired in May 1986. In addition, the CLSMB had no funds to reimburse the banks,
prompting the CBK to be cautious and to demand adequate security for its loans, which the
CLSMB did not have. Therefore, after June 1985 (Annex 6), the CBK also refused to provide
additional loans to the CLSMB and terminated its Subsidiary Credit Agreement. The inability
to borrow by the CLSMB hindered prompt payment to farmers and was a main disincentive to
production.
13.       By the third year of the project little progress had been made compared to what was
envisaged at appraisal. Noteworthy achievements were the establishment of 36 mobile cotton
buying teams; works on the expansion of one ginnery; establishment of CLSMB's regional
offices; and recruitment of essential staff and consultants. Disbursement of credit in 1985 was
very low, amounting to only 3% of what had been estimated at appraisal. The initial successful
operation of the cotton buying teams, which took place under the stimulus of the funds provided
by the consortium of banks, was shortlived due to CLSMB's financial crisis.
14.       Mid-Term  Review.  Because of the slow progress and the reduction of cotton
production in the country, GOK and IDA decided to undertake a joint in-depth mid-term review.
The review was carried out in November 1985 and led to a project reformulation. Agreement
was reached with GOK that the cotton industry should be reorganized by removing the monopoly
of the CLSMB in the purchasing and marketing of cotton and commencing the divestiture of the
CLSMB's responsibilities in the areas of processing, transport, storage, insurance, input supply
and credit to cooperatives and private investors. The reformulation included: the reallocation of
project funds to support CLSMB's financial restructuring; the undertaking of a study to examine
and implement the divestiture program and a cotton subsector policy paper, and the promulgation
of a new Cotton Act. It was also decided that the CLSMB obtain Ksh 270 million as equity
capital from GOK. The IDA Board approved an Agreement Providing for Amendment and
Restatement of the credit.  The amendment diverted SDRs 13.3 million from  the capital
investment program to the import of agricultural inputs and equipment for the cotton subsector.
The intention was to ensure continued IDA support during the transition period.
15.       Progress After the Mid-Term  Review. In spite of the reformulation, however,
cotton production continued to decline. Apart from the lack of a long term policy, which
discouraged private investment, the main reasons for the decline were lack of adequate technical
support in production and continued delays in payment to farmers. Although such delays were
reduced after the CLSMB received a capital injection, there were still problems particularly in
locations where cooperatives were the collecting agents for the CLSMB. The Board's financial
position also worsened with time because of the low level of cotton production which affected
negatively its operations (Annexes 3 to 5).  In addition, its bad loans increased due to its
continued involvement in distribution of agricultural inputs, which were provided to farmers on
credit. Contrary to the mid-term review recommendations, the funds provided to the CLSMB
did not form equity capital and instead were used to clear debts.



-5 -
16.       Because of the decline in production (Annex 1), the ginnery expansion program was
reduced: only one out of the planned five cooperative ginneries was rehabilitated and some
improvements were made to the four CLSMB ginneries. The planned establishment of a new
ginnery was also abandoned.  Likewise, the renovation of some 130 field stores and the
construction of new stores/warehouses were deleted. Apart from the establishment of the cotton
buying teams mentioned earlier, the other important achievement was the introduction of well-
defined cotton buying seasons, which reduced the excessive delays in collecting cotton.
17.       The cotton subsector policy paper was drafted in the form of a Cabinet paper and
became the basis for preparing the Cotton Act. In mid-1988, GOK approved the Cotton Act
which reduced the CLSMB to a non-trading regulatory body, provided for the elimination of its
monopoly in purchasing seed cotton and for the divestiture of its ginnery activities to cooperatives
and/or private investors. Key studies to help implement the new bill, however, were delayed.
The closing date for the technical assistance category of the project was extended to carry out a
cotton pricing and marketing study which included a divestiture plan for the Cotton Board.
18.       Actual project costs were estimated to be US$25.6 million, 77 percent of appraisal
estimates. Of the IDA credit of US$22 million, $21.6 million, or 84 percent were disbursed,
mostly for agricultural inputs and equipment for the cotton subsector. The project closing date
was extended twice from June 30, 1987 to June 30, 1989 for all categories except technical
assistance, which was extended to June 30, 1991.
Project Results and Impact
19.       Overall, the project was not successful in achieving its original objectives. Although
it introduced a new system of cotton collection by establishing buying teams, these were
ineffectual for most part of the project period because of delayed payments.  The limited
improvement on ginneries also brought no qualitative change. Hence, these activities could not
induce the anticipated increases in the production and quality of cotton. Production of seed cotton
dropped from about 29,200 tons per year in 1979/80, when the project was prepared, to about
16,600 tons at completion (Annex 1). The quality of lint has also not improved. To the
contrary, some users believed that the quality of domestic lint had deteriorated and become
unreliable.
20.       The reasons for the decline in production were numerous and include: low and
declining (in real terms) producer prices (Annex 7); delay in payment to producers; lack of
improved agronomic packages; and local tax and other deductions from crop receipts when
farmers were paid by cooperatives. The project had intended to make an impact by tackling the
post harvest handling of cotton, and had underestimated the problems related to production.
Cotton as a crop was grown in Western Kenya by small farmers under rainfed conditions. Unlike
today, where farmers can grow several crops, it was the only cash crop grown in the marginal
areas about two decades back. The existing varieties were introduced from abroad over three
decades ago. No efforts were made to produce improved and suitable varieties. The seed, which
was of mixed variety, was freely distributed by CLSMB to farmers and was never delinted,
selected, tested or certified. It was simply dispatched from ginnery stores to farmers for sowing,
and the remainder sold to oil extraction plants.

21.       The project did not make any positive impact financially to the participating agencies
or economically to the country. Because of low seed cotton production as well as the slight
increase of operational capacity by the project, the ginneries were operating at an average of
about 30% of their capacity. The financial return to the CLSMB and the cooperatives was
therefore negative. Because of this, it is difficult to see how the cooperatives will be able to re-
pay their debts. Both the CLSMB and Luanda Cooperative Society were not able to pay their
debts to the CBK (Annex 6). Likewise, the economic return of the project was negative, as the
expected increase in quantity and improvement in quality of cotton did not materialize.
22.       On the positive side, the failure of the project as originally designed highlighted the
need to restructure the subsector. The project met the revised objective of laying the groundwork
for policy reforms. A new Cotton Act was promulgated in 1988, and a study was carried out
to design a new system for cotton marketing and processing and to recommend an operational
plan to divest the CLSMB of its current functions, limiting its role to regulatory functions
specified under the Cotton Act. However, follow-on support needs to be provided to help GOK
carry out the reforms.
Project Sustainability
23.       A restructuring of the subsector is necessary to its viability. The monopoly by the
Cotton Board in every aspect of cotton processing and marketing was clearly not sustainable. As
shown by the project, financial injections could only provide temporary and minimal relief.
Although the Cotton Act was approved in 1988, little progress has been made to implement it
because of the delays in completing the studies. IDA is now assisting GOK to prepare the Second
Agriculture Sector Management Project, which would include measures to promote private trade
in cotton, divestiture of ginneries and privatization of retail marketing, and reorient the activities
of the Cotton Board.  Such a project will only succeed, however, provided the necessary
sustained commitment is obtained from the key parties concerned, and built into the project
design.
24.       In addition, agronomic research for cotton, which was seriously neglected, is
important to increasing and sustaining production. The project tried to provide some assistance
to cotton research by financing limited consultancies, which were not enough to tackle the serious
problems of cotton.  What is needed is practically oriented research in agronomy and
entomology, as well as provision of quality seed, for the development of cotton. Currently, there
are limited technical packages both for rainfed and irrigated cotton, and the present extension
service is ineffective because of this. In the traditional cotton growing areas in Western Kenya,
there is increasing competition from food crops as the result of technical improvement in growing
these crops. Cotton is now being displaced by these crops, and is increasingly being inter-
cropped with maize or beans regardless of the effect on yields.
Bank Performance
25.       Given the neglected state of the cotton sub-sector and the growing nature of the textile
industry, the Bank was right in supporting the development of cotton in Kenya. However, the
Bank's involvement in identification and preparation of the project was superficial, resulting in
a project design that did not address the fundamental issues of the subsector.



-7 -
26.       The Bank was too complacent with the project, considering that it waited about three
years between project appraisal and credit effectiveness; it resisted reviewing the project during
this period when production of seed cotton was falling, and was willing to go ahead with the
project even when its performance was disappointing. However, at the mid-term review, the
Bank took an active stance in redesigning the project and restructuring the subsector.
27.       In general, the supervision missions were unduly optimistic about the future of the
project even after continuous poor performance. Ratings in the first three years showed that the
project was only suffering from moderate problems. After the mid-term review, supervision of
the project was complemented by the Bank's policy dialogue under the Agricultural Sector
Adjustment Operations I (Cr. 1717-KE) which included the deregulation of cotton processing and
marketing as one of its reform actions.
Borrower Performance
28.       The Borrower took a long time to implement the financing arrangement. To complete
an arrangement with commercial banks for a revolving line of credit, GOK was required to give
a guarantee on behalf of CLSMB. Parliamentary approval for this guarantee was not obtained
until mid-1982, more than two years after appraisal. Other Government actions requiring high-
level approvals also took much longer than expected. The promulgation of the Cotton Act, for
instance, occurred two years later than stipulated in the amendment to the credit agreement.
Implementation of the new Act was supposed to start three months after its finalization, but to
this day, little has been done.
29.       The Government had a major say in directing project implementation under the
PCSC. However, the ministries involved were not too concerned, perhaps due to the fact that
the activities were not carried out directly under their departments. The PCSC met for the first
time only about six months after credit effectiveness, following a number of reminders by the
Bank. Although the number of meetings by the PCSC was adequate, being more than the twice
a year envisaged under the Development Credit Agreement, the ministries were often inclined
to send junior representatives to the PCSC meetings. Thus many decisions by PCSC could not
be pursued at higher level in the ministries concerned. The PCSC, for instance was not in a
position to solve disagreements on financing among CBK, CLSMB and the consortium of banks.
Also, due to budgetary constraints, GOK allocated as little as 10 percent of the required project
budget in the initial years, making it impossible to implement the project.
Project Relationship
30.       Relationship between GOK and the Bank were good throughout. The only time when
the relationship became tense was when GOK delayed excessively in meeting the commitments
it undertook to further process the project after appraisal. But this situation was soon overcome
after GOK complied with its commitments.
Consulting Services
31.       Originally, the project provided for about 250 man-months of long-term consultants,
but this was revised downwards to 192 man-months as follows: technical advisor (72 man-
months), financial advisor (36 man-months), cotton research specialist (30 man-months) and
financial analyst (54 man-months). With the exception of the latter, who was attached to the



-8-
CBK, the other three were attached to the CLSMB. Overall the performance of the consultants
was adequate, operating more like managers in line positions rather than advisors and/or trainers.
Project Documentation and Data
32.       A striking feature of the project is the multiplicity of agreements signed between the
Bank and the Borrower; between the Bank and implementing agencies and between the
implementing agencies. The following agreements have governed project execution:
(a)    Development Credit Agreement, between GOK and IDA.
(b)    Project Agreement, between IDA and the CLSMB.
(c)    Letter of Agreement, between CBK and IDA.
(d)    Revolving Credit Agreement, between CLSMB and a consortium of banks.
(e)    Subsidiary Loan Agreement, between GOK and CBK.
(f)    Subsidiary Financing Agreement, between CBK and CLSMB.
(g)    Loan Agreement between, CBK and the cooperatives.
33.       Project documentation and systematic collection and filing of data by the
implementation agencies has been poor.  Considerable difficulties were therefore faced in
preparing this PCR. The Monitoring and Evaluation Unit has not succeeded in collecting,
consolidating and keeping project information and data, including project expenditures. The
Monitoring and Evaluation Unit is presently non operational after the project has been completed.
Lessons Learned
34.       The lessons learned are summarized as follows:
(a)    A comprehensive analysis of the subsector and its long-term development is
necessary before major investments are made. In this case, the lack of
analytical work before project preparation resulted in a project design that
tackled symptoms and not the fundamental problems of the subsector.
(b)    In the absence of a competitive marketing and pricing structure, incremental
changes alone would not bring improvements to the subsector. A process of
adjustment followed by supporting investments is needed to make the
industry viable in the long-term.
(c)    Project design was overly complex. The financing and organization and
management arrangements were intricate and involved many agencies. If one
chain in the link is missing, the arrangement falls apart.
(d)    The production and supply of raw materials, in this case, cotton, should not
be treated lightly in a marketing and processing project. The appraisal
mission had too much faith in other Government programs to take care of
that end but when the expected results did not materialize, the project was
jeopardized.



- 9 -
(e)    When there is a long gap between appraisal and effectiveness, the situation
should be carefully analyzed before we decide to go ahead with the project
as originally designed.
(f)    Flexibility in project implementation salvaged the project. At the mid-term
review, the project was redesigned into an adjustment operation to reform the
subsector. Follow up investments to support the implementation of these
reforms are envisaged in the Agriculture Sector Adjustment II Project. Such
a project will only succeed, however, provided the necessary sustained
commitment is obtained from the key parties concerned, and built into the
project design.
