        to support the Government's effort to increase the\n            operational efficiency of its railways and to assist the\n            railways in their financial recovery.  The project consists\n            of several components. They include (i) a comprehensive\n            program for improving the maintenance and management of the\n            locomotive fleet; (ii) overhaul of about 740 km of main line\n            track, and provision of track overhaul equipment.  They\n            further involve (iii) modernization of about 700 km of main\n            line signalling; (iv) construction of about 65 km of track;\n            and (v) technical assistance and training.  The project is\n            also designed to assist in institutional development through\n            an agreed Action Plan covering organizational, planning,\n            marketing and financial objectives as well as measures for\n            improving technical and operational performance."}, "docdt": "1986-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
