6. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design

Colombia's Ozone Depleting Substances Phaseout Project assisted the country in phasing
out Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) and in complying with Colombia's Montreal
Protocol Commitments. The project financed the incremental costs of conversion to non-
ODS technology for a group of priority cost-effective sub-projects in five industrial
sectors (polystyrene foam, commercial/domestic refrigeration, solvents, mobile air
conditioning and domestic refrigeration) contributing to reduce ODS consumption in
Colombia.

The sub-sections below describe the country context at appraisal and the objectives,
components, and main outcomes of this operation.

6.1 Context at Appraisal

The Montreal Protocol (MP) on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer was adopted in
1987 as an international treaty to eliminate the production and consumption of ozone-
depleting chemicals including chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halons, carbon tetrachloride
(CTC), methyl chloroform (TCA), and methyl bromide (MeBr). Scientific theory and
evidence suggest that these compounds, once emitted to the atmosphere, could
significantly deplete the stratospheric ozone layer that shields the planet from damaging
UV-B radiation. Under this treaty, developed countries must phase out ODS by the year
2000 (2005 for TCA and MeBr). Developing countries, also known as Article 5 countries
in the context of the Protocol, benefit from a 10-year grace period. Table 1 below shows
the phase out schedule for Article 5 countries.

Colombia signed the Vienna Convention in 1990 and the Montreal Protocol (MP) in 1992
(Law 29). Under the MP, the Government of Colombia (GOC) committed to (a) freezing
1999 CFC consumption at average 95-97 consumption levels; (b) reducing CFC
consumption by 50 percent by 2005; (c) reducing CFC consumption by an additional 35
percent by 2007; and (d) phasing out CFC consumption by 2010. The country's
remaining commitments under the MP are summarized in Table 1 below.

Brief historical overview of the implementation of the Montreal Protocol Program in
Colombia.
In 1994, the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund (Excom) approved the
Country Program (CP) prepared by the GOC. The baseline year for the CP was 1992,
during which ODS consumption reached 2,224 tonnes. The CP described the trends of
ODS consumption, identified the major consuming sectors in the country, and it outlined
the country's strategy for their phaseout.

By the end of 1998 and prior to the start of the Bank's MP project, the GOC had
completed implementation of 17 projects financed by the Multilateral Fund for the
implementation of the Montreal Protocol (MPMF). A total of US$9.5 million had been
granted for the phaseout of 980 tonnes of ODS.           Sixteen of these projects were
implemented by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the final project
was a bilateral cooperation effort with the government of the United States.

By 1999, Colombia's first commitment under the Montreal Protocol came into force, and
as required, the country froze its allowable amount of imports of Annex A Group 1
substances to the average level consumed during 1995 and 1997, or 2,208 tonnes.
However, by 1999, the actual consumption of CFCs in the country only reached 986



                                               4

tonnes. The drastic decrease in consumption from 1992 to 1999 was attributed to various
factors, including but not limited to: i) consistent government action in line with the
strategies of the CP and with financing from the MPMF; and ii) a strong economic
recession that greatly affected industrial output during 1998-1999. ODS consumption
increased again in the early 2000 as the country's economy recovered, but remained well
within the 1995-1997 baseline, in compliance with the MP. (Actual consumption figures
from 1986 to 2005 are included in Table 8).

By the end of 2001, the modality for implementation of MP projects, at the global level,
changed from a project-by- project approach to a sectoral or even a national phaseout
mode. This shift in operations resulted from the realization that an individual project
approach would be inadequate to phase out the remaining global ODS consumption,
which at the time was largely attributed to the servicing sector (mobile air conditioning,
commercial and domestic refrigeration). The Excom encouraged countries to adopt this
new modality of implementation, and to integrate any remaining individual conversion
projects were integrated into sectoral strategies.

In response to the recommendations from the Excom, in 2002, the GOC undertook the
review of its CP. This was subsequently followed by the preparation of its National ODS
Phaseout Plan (NPP). The NPP identified all remaining ODS consumption that would be
eligible for MPMF financing, and it outlined a schedule for its phaseout, in line with the
targets of the MP. The NPP was approved by the Excom in 2003, and it addressed
roughly 1,100 tonnes of remaining, eligible ODS consumption in the country.           UNDP
was the implementing agency selected by the GOC to prepare and carry out
implementation of the NPP. Therefore, funding for the phaseout of the remaining 1,100
tonnes, roughly US$4.5 million, was assigned to UNDP.


ODS Phase out Institutional Structure and Project Background
At the time Colombia's Ozone Depleting Substances Phase out Project was prepared
(1998), Colombia's Ministry of the Environment (currently Ministerio de Ambiente,
Vivienda y Desarrollo Territorial, MAVDT) was in charge of coordinating activities to
promote phase out of ODS as mandated in the Montreal Protocol.

Financial support to create the country's Ozone Technical Unit (UTO) was approved by
the ExCom in March 1994 as an Institutional Strengthening project to be implemented
through UNDP (UNDP COL/94/G61). The UTO was created within the MAVDT, and
was made responsible for implementing and monitoring the country's ODS phase out
program. The Institutional Strengthening project was initially approved for three years. A
renewal for additional two years of UTO's operations was approved in March 1998 and
later, another project was structured to support the unit's operation until the year 2010.

Through the UTO, the MAVDT was given broad policy, regulatory and monitoring
mandates. In addition, the MAVDT was also responsible for sub-project identification,
preparation and implementation supervision roles for the Bank's ODS phase out
operations in Colombia. The MAVDT was responsible for coordinating with other



                                              5

ministries and institutions involved in ODS phase out, including being counterpart to the
Montreal Protocol Implementing Agencies. These agencies are the World Bank, UNDP,
and the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP), as well as other bilateral
cooperation agencies.

World Bank MP projects consist of industrial and technological conversions that enable
the elimination or reduction of ozone depleting substances in private and public entities.
MPMF finances the incremental costs associated to those conversions, which are defined
in terms of both capital and/or operating costs. Depending on the particular sectors,
MPMF finances incremental costs under pre-agreed cost-effectiveness thresholds.
Potential enterprise beneficiaries develop their projects together with government
agencies and with MP implementing agencies, and these proposals are then submitted to
the MPMF's Executive Committee for approval.

In Colombia, the Bank project was structured as an umbrella operation, where individual
Montreal Protocol projects approved by MPMF would become subprojects. This way,
there was only one Grant Agreement between the Government of Colombia (GOC),
represented by ACCI and MAVDT, and the Bank. For specific activities, the umbrella
Grant Agreement was complemented by sub-grant agreements between the government
executing agency and the beneficiary enterprises.

The OTF Grant Agreement in Colombia was signed for US$8.652 million. This
corresponded to an indicative ceiling, which was determined on the basis of the country's
ODS consumption trends outlined in the 1994 CP and on the expected impact of the
Bank's potential projects. The ceiling was determined by assuming: i) an average cost-
effectiveness level of US$14.7 per kg of ODS eliminated, which was estimated based on
the ODS consuming industries in the country identified in the CP and on their individual
cost-effectiveness thresholds; and ii) the combined impact of Bank's projects would be
roughly 30% of the country's consumption in 1997, or 590 tonnes.             The ceiling
represented the maximum expected value of the projects proposals that could be
presented by the World Bank to the Excom on behalf of the GOC.

The two assumptions upon which the project ceiling was estimated were based on the
country's consumption trends, on its strategy for future ODS phaseout as approved by the
Excom, and on the historical involvement of the Bank in Colombia as one of the four
implementing agencies of the MP.          This methodology allowed flexibility in the
implementation of an uncertain number of projects in undetermined sectors and therefore
with a significant range of cost-effectiveness (as shown in Table 8). A similar procedure
for establishing overall program ceilings was used by the Bank in the development of all
of its MP operations, as well as by the other implementing agencies when estimating the
potential size of their portfolio.

The actual level of funds approved by the MPMF and disbursed by the Bank project was
considerably lower than the estimated ceiling for reasons that will be outlined in this
report and that include: i) the development of new implementation modalities for MP
projects that eliminated the presence of multiple agencies in the same country and limited



                                             6

the sectors available for Bank participation; ii) a phaseout schedule more effective than
that originally planned and outlined in the CP; iii) changes in MP policies regarding
industrial sectors eligible for financing; iv) changing market conditions; and v) the
development of new more cost-effective technologies that reduced the overall costs of
conversion projects. It is important to note however, that although only 30% of the
project's indicative ceiling was disbursed, this represents roughly 83% of the funds
actually approved by the Excom for Bank implementation (see Table 5).

The Agencia Colombiana de Cooperacion International (ACCI)1 was the Financial
Intermediary and procurement agent, while the Ministry of Environment (MAVDT) was
the executing agency (in charge of identifying subprojects, assigning priorities, and
monitoring overall implementation and compliance with the MP). ACCI was assigned
the following responsibilities: i) administering MP grants for subprojects endorsed by
UTO; ii) disbursing grants to subproject beneficiaries; iii) maintaining project and
subproject accounts and arranging audits; iv) supervising project implementation with
UTO; and v) evaluating the financial viability of enterprises based on eligibility criteria
agreed with the Bank.

1Through Decreto No. 2467 of 19 June 2005, ACCI was merged with Red de Solidaridad Social, resulting
in the Agencia Presidencial para la Acción Social y la Cooperación Internacional (Accion Social). During
the final year of project implementation Accion Social continued to perform the tasks previously done by
ACCI, and in particular, assisted the Bank through the final stages of project closure. For the purpose of
this ICR and in the interest of clarity, the agency will be consistently referred to as ACCI throughout this
document.

Colombia has never produced ODS and therefore all consumption has historically been
imported.

Of the roughly 2,160 ODP tonnes consumed in 1995, approximately 1,580 (or 73%
percent of the total) were consumed by the refrigeration and air conditioning sub-sector.
By 1999, when the project was launched, refrigeration, rigid foams and MAC were the
predominant remaining consumers by sectors of application.


6.2 Original Global Environmental Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as
Approved)

The objectives of the Colombia's Ozone Depleting Substances Phaseout Project, as
originally approved, were to: (a) protect the stratospheric ozone layer by providing
financial incentives for industrial conversion from ODS to non-ODS technologies in
Colombia; and (b) to promote measures which reduce/eliminate emissions of ODS in
Colombia.



2Consumption, as defined by Article 1 of the Montreal Protocol, means production plus imports minus
exports of controlled substances.


                                                    8

The original project indicators used by the Bank to monitor performance were: (a)
number of subprojects adopting alternative technologies (b) metric tonnes of ODS phased
out during project implementation, (c) enterprise compliance with equipment disposal
agreements and, (d) effectiveness of UTO in identifying, facilitating the preparation of
and monitoring implementation of ExCom approved projects. Information on these
indicators is included in the Project Completion Reports prepared by the Bank and the
GOC and submitted to the MPMF Secretariat after each subproject is completed.


6.3 Revised GEO and Key Indicators (as Approved by Original Approving
Authority) and Reasons/Justification

The original objectives of the project were not revised, but the project closing date was
extended for 2 years (from July 2004 to June 2006) at the request of the GOC, to allow
completion of on-going activities.


6.4 Main Beneficiaries, Original and Revised

The main beneficiaries of this grant were Colombian enterprises converting to the new
alternative technologies to eliminate or reduce ODS emissions. Although the project did
not specifically focus on any particular sector, it established a broad target of
beneficiaries that included those industries that used ODS in their production operations,
especially rigid polyurethane foam producers who used CFC-11 as a foaming agent and
commercial refrigeration equipment producers and service organizations. It established
the rigid polyurethane, foam thermal panel producers, MAC and commercial refrigeration
as priority sectors.

Global benefits also resulted from the elimination of ODS, as depletion of stratospheric
ozone could lead to significant increases in UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface.
Increased UV radiation could in turn lead to adverse human and animal health effects, as
well as ecosystem impacts. The ozone layer protects the biosphere from this type of
radiation.


6.5 Original Components (as Approved)

The project had three components: (i) Investment in Subprojects, to finance subprojects
with Colombian enterprises that were using ODS in their production processes. (ii)
Technical Assistance/Financial Agency Fee, to enable transfer of 3% fee of all MPOTF
disbursements for administering the MPMF funds (i.e., disbursement, procurement,
auditing and general administrative monitoring services); and to allow institutional
strengthening of GOC to manage MP operations. And (iii) Operating costs component, to
allow grant resources to be used to cover small operating costs such as fees, travel, and
office supplies and expenses.

The Project Appraisal Document and Grant Agreement did not specify the sectors in
which the World Bank would be involved, it only provided the indicative ceiling that was
allowable under the project. The PAD listed 18 enterprises that had been identified as
eligible to receive financing under the MP in the rigid foam, commercial refrigeration,
MAC, supermarket and solvent sectors. The expected cumulative impact of these pre-
identified subprojects was 298 ODP tonnes, with an expected cost of US$4.97 million.
The PAD also noted that the Bank was working on the preparation of commercial
refrigeration projects and awaiting Excom guidelines on eligibility. A potential impact of
500 ODP tonnes was expected from this sector.

6.5.1. Component 1 ­ Goods, works and services

As part of the investment component, the MPMF approved twelve sub-projects in five
sub-sectors. These sub-projects were (a) technology conversion in four MAC companies:
Thermocoil, Auto Aires, Calaires and ServiAires ­ these four enterprises were grouped
under one umbrella project; (b) solvent project to replace CFC-113 technology-based
equipment with alternative technologies in the silicone coating process of needles and
catheters at Laboratorios Rymco; (c) rigid polyurethane foams sector with technology
conversion projects from CFC-11 to HCFC-141b at GMP Quimicos, Friotermica,
Indufrio, Daniel J. Fernandez and Rojas Hermanos; (d) commercial/domestic
refrigeration projects for replacing CFC-12 for HFC-134a technology at Fermat, Polares,
and Cabarria; and (e) CTC process agent, and conversion technology in the
manufacturing of liquid chlorine, caustic soda, sodium hypochlorite hydrochloric acid
and ferric chloride at Prodesal.

Table 5 summarizes approved and actual indicators for the 12 MP sub-projects
implemented by the Bank. A total of US$499,875 were not disbursed and have been
reimbursed to the MPMF.

  (*) Auto Aires, Calaires and Servi Aires did not consume any ODS, but they assembled MAC condensers from parts
  produced by Thermocoil. The four companies had to undergo technological conversion in order to produce ODS-free
  condensers and therefore the combined impact of the project was 137 ODP tonnes.

Although the MPMF originally approved a total amount of US$2,989,335, some
adjustments were made to the following projects during their implementation:

    -   Cabarria y Cia S.A.: the approved amount was adjusted from USD 211,636 to
        USD 118,542 upon verification of individual enterprises consumption and
        eligibility;
    -   Auto Aires: total amount was modified from US$28,393 to US$15,137 as the
        company was unable to provide documentation to justify some of its expenses;
    -   GMP: the project's costs were from US$584,727 to US$414,791 as the number of
        enterprises initially included in the project document was reduced;
    -   Master Cooler was cancelled due to bankruptcy of the enterprise;
    -   Prodesal, as explained below the Prodesal project was transferred to UNDP.


Projects implemented versus those pre-identified in the PAD: Twelve of the eighteen
subprojects that had been pre-identified in the PAD were actually implemented
(Thermocoil, Auto Aires and Calaires had been identified as individual subprojects and
they were implemented as one umbrella project). Of the list of potential subprojects in
the pipeline at the time of Bank approval, only two projects in the MAC sector and
projects in the supermarket sector were not implemented. It is important to note that
projects in the supermarket sector, which were expected to be implemented by the Bank
with a significant impact, were ultimately not eligible for financing under the MPMF, as
per revised Excom guidelines. Moreover, 87% of the MAC sector was phased out
through the implementation of the umbrella MAC project.

Amount approved versus actual disbursement: In all cases for which the amount
approved differs from that disbursed, the subproject in question was an umbrella project.
These were particularly difficult projects to prepare and to implement, and the reason for
the discrepancy resides in the manner in which they had to be prepared in order to ensure
Excom approval. At the time of submission of project proposals, all of the potential
enterprises participating in the project had to be identified, their ODS consumption had to
be documented, inventories of their baseline equipment had to taken, and informal
commitment of participation in the project was needed. In the majority of the cases,
umbrella projects involved small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which would at first
show signs of interest in participating in the project, but when faced with commitments
and requirements would typically decide not to go forward. The final list of SMEs
participating in an umbrella project rarely matched that which was approved, and
therefore the actual amount of disbursements, as well as the actual impact of the project
at the end of implementation, were typically not the same. The Excom is aware of this
situation, and implementing agencies are not penalized for changes in the list of project
beneficiaries, as long as those changes are within the boundaries of the project objectives.
Documentation must be provided in all cases to justify any changes and any unspent
balance must be returned to the MPMF upon project completion.




                                              12

Counterpart funds: Almost all projects implemented required a certain amount of
counterpart financing, which cover the costs of expenditures that were not eligible for
financing under the MPMF (i.e. non incremental expenditures). A total of US$306,251
was leveraged in counterpart financing, which amounts to 12% of resources awarded.
Considering the size of some of the beneficiary companies and the economic conditions
of the industrial sector at the time of project implementation, the ability to leverage these
funds was added benefit of the project.

Approved versus actual impact: The reasons for occasional differences between approved
and actual impact, in the case of group projects, could be due to changing lists of project
beneficiaries or to changes in the patterns of consumption of a given enterprise. It was
not uncommon to develop a project based on ODS consumption prior to 1999, and by the
time the project was implemented, the enterprise's consumption had decreased
considerably. The overall impact of the project in such cases would be lower than that
approved.

Duration of projects: Most subprojects were prepared based on an implementation
schedule of two years. In reality, none of the projects were implemented within that
timeframe, and as shown in Table 5 some projects took considerably longer to be
completed. There are many reasons for these perceived delays, which are repeatedly
noted in Project Completion Reports. Some of these include:
· Definition of project start and completion: The dates included in Table 5 correspond
    to the official dates reported to the Excom. Implementation theoretically starts with
    the approval of a project by Excom, when in actuality, project activities may lag
    significantly. A sub-grant agreement needs to be signed between the government and
    the beneficiary enterprise and this process typically lasted from three to nine months
    depending on the size, the location and the commitment level of the enterprise. When
    dealing with SMEs, the timeframes would be even slower.               Moreover, project
    completion, as defined by the Excom, corresponds to the date when: i) production
    with the alternative substance begins; ii) no consumption of ODS remains; and iii)
    baseline equipment has been destroyed. In the majority of the cases beneficiary
    enterprises would begin production using the new equipment but did not meet the
    other two conditions for project completion until much later.          The project was
    therefore not officially completed, and perceived implementation delays followed.
· The submittal of appropriate documentation and justification was consistently one of
    the issues that caused the greatest implementation delays. Given that all expenditures
    under the MPMF must be reported and are audited, enterprises were required to
    submit extensive amounts of documentation at various phases of implementation.
    This proved to be a difficult and taxing issue, as some of the beneficiaries,
    particularly the smaller ones, did not have access to documents, were not used to
    sharing these, and were in many cases apprehensive to provide so much information
    to a government agency.


A detailed description of each of the sub­projects implemented under the Bank MP
project follows below:



                                             13

MAC sector
The MPMF approved four sub-projects in this sector, Thermocoil, Auto Aires, Calaires
and Servi Aires, for a total amount of US$1.358 million. Auto Aires, Calaires and Servi
Aires did not directly consume any ODS, but they assembled MAC condensers from
parts produced by Thermocoil. Once Thermocoil underwent conversion, in order for
Auto Aires, Calaires and Servi Aires to continue assembling condensers with the new
ODS-free parts they required new equipment, which were financed by the MPMF. These
four subprojects were approved and implemented as one umbrella project and the
combined phase out for this sector was 137 ODP tonnes.

Thermo Coil. The objective of this sub-project was to acquire technology to manufacture
parallel-flow condensers compatible with HFC-134a refrigerant. By the time the project
was implemented, Thermo Coil produced approximately 83% of all condensers used in
the MAC market. The project consisted of changing the tube and fin condenser to a
parallel flow design that would require: (a) a new multi-flow-tube cutting system and a
fin machine for manufacturing the corrugated fins, (b) a Nocolok furnace brazing
process, in which nitrogen gas is applied continuously and a non corrosive flux is utilized
to effect proper brazing, (c) an aqueous spray washer and drier system and a waste water
treatment system, and (d) technology transfer and assistance, product performance
testing, training, and consultant services.

Calaires, AutoAires and ServiAires: these three companies were included in the group
project. As mentioned above, these three companies assembled condensers from parts
produced by Thermocoil. Calaires and Autoaires had already acquired the necessary
equipment to produce parts and fittings by the time the project was implemented, and
therefore the subproject provided retroactive funding for equipment and training.
Serviaires procured a gas recovery system and a pipe bending machine.


Sterilization sector
The sterilization project was approved with the objective of replacing CFC-113 for
HCFC-114 as solvent in the silicone coating process of needles and catheters at
Laboratorios Rymco. The MPMF approved USD 81,579 to replace 7.6 ODP tonnes in the
manufacture of approximately 180,000,000 of hypodermic needles and intravenous
catheters.

The project allowed Rymco to permanently end its consumption of CFC-113. Delays in
implementation of this specific project were caused by technical difficulties in reaching
the company's stringent quality control standards.


Rigid Foams sector
The objective of all four projects in this sector was to replace the use of CFC-11 in the
manufacture of rigid polyurethane foam through the use of HCFC-141b technology.
Implementation was undertaken as follows:



                                            14

- Daniel J. Fernandez: The company specializes in producing polyurethane
  sandwich panels for insulating and construction purposes, foam insulated roof
  covers, and polyurethane foam for pipe insulation. The project assisted DJF in
  phasing out the use of CFC-11 in the production of its polyurethane foams by
  converting to the use of HCFC-141b based foam.          The project replaced the
  company's low pressure blowing machine with a new high pressure foaming
  machine to use HCFC-141b blowing/insulating technology. Pre-heating devices
  for the mechanical molds or fixtures were also provided to ensure consistent
  production of the new HCFC-141b blown foam. Training activities were also
  funded by the project. Implementation was delayed (as per Table 5) mainly due
  to completion of equipment import tax information and other documentation as
  required by the subgrant agreement.

- Friotermica: The company specializes in producing polyurethane sandwich
  panels for insulating and construction purposes, and evaporators, condensers, and
  parts for commercial refrigeration applications. The project phased out the use of
  CFC-11 in the production of polyurethane foams by converting the company to
  the use of HCFC-141b based foam. The project replaced the low pressure foam
  blowing machine with a high pressure foaming machine to use HCFC-141b
  blowing/insulating technology. The project also funded retrofitting of the molds
  in order to ensure pre-heating for proper foam adhesion to the metal sheets.
  Training activities were also provided to the company.

- Mastercooler: The objective of the project was to eliminate consumption of CFC-
  11 used in the manufacture of rigid polyurethane foams at the production plant.
  The project would have assisted the company in converting to the use of HCFC-
  22 based foam. The project would have financed gas blending equipment such
  that the low boiling point blowing agent (HCFC) could be incorporated into the
  polyol. The project also required a high pressure foaming machine and heated
  presses to ensure good adhesion. Training would have been provided to the
  company The company went bankrupt before the onset of implementation and
  therefore the project was cancelled. All funds were returned to the MPMF.

- Indufrio: The company specializes in producing polyurethane sandwich panels for
  insulating, and also produces equipment for commercial refrigeration, horizontal
  glass cabinet and vertical glass cabinets. The project phased out the use of CFC-
  11 in the production of its polyurethane foams by converting to enterprise to the
  use of HCFC-141b based foam. The project replaced the low pressure foam
  machine with a new high pressure foaming machine to use HCFC-141b
  blowing/insulating technology. Molds and training were also provided. This
  particular project underwent considerable delays due to the delicate financial
  situation of the enterprise at the time of project implementation. Significant
  efforts were made to ensure the financial sustainability of the project (e.g. action
  plan was prepared with Indufrio and with the cooperation of enterprise suppliers
  as well as the Superintendence of Industry and Commerce).



                                       15

-  Rojas Hermanos: The company specializes in producing polyurethane sandwich
   panels for insulating and construction purposes, and evaporators, condensers, and
   parts for commercial refrigeration applications. The objective of the project was
   the complete elimination of CFC-11 used in the manufacture of rigid
   polyurethane foams at the production plant of the company. The project paid
   retroactively for a high pressure foaming machine that used HCFC-141b
   blowing/insulating technology. The project also funded retrofitting of the molds
   in order to ensure pre-heating for proper foam adhesion to the metal sheets, as
   well as training activities.

-  GMP Quimicos: This umbrella project proposed to phase out the consumption of
   CFC-11 from 29 foam enterprises in Colombia.            Some of the pre-identified
   enterprises ultimately decided not to participate in the project, while new
   enterprises joined in once implementation had begun. Final project costs included
   the participation of 21 enterprises, which converted to the use of HCFC-141b.
   GMP PRODUCTOS QUÍMICOS S.A., a suplier for the beneficiary companies
   that became Group Project Coodinator, was also a beneficiary from the project
   (total number of beneficiaries was 22). Table 6 lists the final beneficiaries from
   the project and summarizes the actual characteristics of each subproject.

    This was a very complex project, given the relatively small size of the participating
    companies, and the fact that all potential participating companies had different
    institutional and financial capacity. Depending on the type of application, the project
    funded either high or low pressure foam injecting equipment, which was bought in
    lots by GMP achieving some economies of scale. GMP also provided technical
    assistance and performed tests to achieve densities and foam formulations suitable to
    each company. The difficulty to find appropriate insurance policies to back the grants
    received while implementation took place proved to be the most important delaying
    factor in the execution of this umbrella project.


Refrigeration (commercial and domestic) sector
Projects in this sub-sector aimed at eliminating the use of CFC-11 as blowing agent and
CFC-12 as refrigerant in the domestic and commercial refrigeration sectors. Specific
sub-projects were approved and implemented as follows:

- Polares: the project replaced the use of CFC-11 foam blowing agent with HCFC-141b
and CFC-12 refrigerant with HFC-134a in the manufacturing of commercial and
domestic refrigerators as well as polyurethane sandwich panels. Funding was used to
purchase a SAIP high pressure foaming equipment, an HFC-134a charging machine,
vacuum pumps retrofit, and training.

- Fermat: the project for Fermat Comercial Ltda. (the company changed its named from
Industrias de Refrigeracion Supernordico) replaced the use of CFC-11 foam blowing
agent with HCFC-141b and CFC-12 refrigerant with HFC-134a in the manufacturing of
commercial and domestic refrigerators as well as polyurethane sandwich panels. Despite
some delays during implementation while tax exemption documentation was cleared by
the Ozone Technical Unit, the Financial Agent, and the Government, the project was
successfully implemented and the objectives were achieved.

- Cabarria: This second umbrella project proposed to phase out the consumption of
CFC-11 and CFC-12 from 17 small and medium commercial refrigeration enterprises in
Colombia. As in the case of the GMP project, some of the pre-identified enterprises
ultimately decided not to participate in the project, while new enterprises joined in once
implementation had begun. Final project costs included the participation of 9 enterprises,
which converted to the use of HCFC-141b and HFC-134a.                  CABARRIA Y CIA S.A,
acted as group coordinator and was also a beneficiary from the project (total number of


                                                 17

beneficiaries was 10). This project was particularly difficult to implement because most
of the beneficiary companies were from the refrigeration servicing sector, and therefore
consisted of small workshops that were difficult to coordinate. These small enterprises
had considerable difficulties meeting the necessary requirements to participate in the
project, such as financial statements and insurance policies. Beneficiary enterprises
received small pieces of equipment (i.e. vacuum pumps and manifold gauges) and triaing.
Issues of enterprise commitment with project objectives greatly delayed implementation
of this project, which ultimately was implemented with significantly less companies than
expected. Table 7 summarizes the final details of the project.

CTC Process Agents sector
The Colombian National Phaseout Plan (NPP) included provisions for the phaseout of
ODS consumption in the solvent and process agent sectors. However, conversion of one
specific subsector, Carbon Tetrachloride as process agent at Prodesal S.A., was
specifically left out of the NPP and remained as the final activity to be implemented by
the Bank. The reason for this concession was that the Bank started working on the
preparation of this project in early 2001, and due to the technical difficulties associated
with the conversion technology and with the estimated costs of the project, by 2003 when
the NPP was approved, preparation of this subproject had still not been completed.
Project preparation was stopped for a year given the lack of cost-efficient technical
alternatives, and it only resumed in 2005. The Bank maintained its commitment to the
government and the enterprise to find the best possible solution to their conversion, and
the project was finally approved by the Excom in late 2005. By that time, all Bank
implemented projects had been completed and the overall MP program was approaching
closure. The costs of extending the Grant Agreement for the implementation of this last
project were too high. Meanwhile the NPP (which included a solvent-process agent


                                                 18

sector component) and the Institutional Strengthening projects were under full
implementation by UNDP. With the agreement of the government and of UNDP, the
Excom approved transfer of the project to UNDP in early 2006.


6.5.2. Technical assistance/Recipient's Fee/Travel component

Regarding the technical assistance component, expected funds at the beginning of the
project were US$252,000, which corresponded to the agreed 3% fee allocated to ACCI,
the Financial Intermediary, for their involvement in the project. This allocated amount
was calculated on the basis of the indicative ceiling of the project (US$8.652 million).
However, since only US$2.989 million in subprojects were approved by the MPMF,
ACCI's fee corresponded to only US$86,900 (ACCI only received 1.5% on cancelled and
transferred projects). A total of US$86,649 (99.7%) of the allocated amount for this
category was disbursed.

The project effectively contributed to the institutional strengthening of MAVDT and
ACCI. While MAVDT gained considerable experience in negotiation techniques at the
international level and a better understanding of the mechanisms of several agencies of
the United Nations, the UTO and ICCA gained extensive capacity on project
management and the Bank's procurement and financial management procedures

The OTF Grant Agreement in Colombia was prepared to assist the country in meeting its
MP commitments. The Grant was signed in 1999 for a total of US$8.652 million. This
amount of funding corresponded to an indicative ceiling, which was determined on the
basis of the country's ODS consumption trends outlined in the 1994 Country Program
prepared by the government and on the expected impact of the Bank's potential projects.
The ceiling was determined by assuming: i) an average cost-effectiveness level of
US$14.7 per kg of ODS eliminated, which was estimated based on the ODS consuming



                                           19

industries in the country identified in the CP and on their individual cost-effectiveness
thresholds; and ii) the combined impact of Bank's projects would be roughly 30% of the
country's consumption in 1997, or 596 tonnes. The ceiling represented the maximum
expected value of the projects proposals that could be presented by the World Bank to the
Excom on behalf of the GOC.

This methodology allowed flexibility in the implementation of an uncertain number of
projects in undetermined sectors and therefore with a significant range of cost-
effectiveness. Similar procedures for establishing overall program ceilings were used up
to 2001 by the Bank in the development of all of its MP operations, as well as by the
other implementing agencies when estimating the potential size of their portfolio. After
2001 the major modality for implementation of MP investment operations changed and
National Phaseout Plans were developed in countries around the world. National Plans
were prepared on the basis of country ODS market studies and updated remaining
consumption. They presented an overall assessment, by sector, of ODS consumption,
and therefore allowed a better estimation of eligible phaseout potential.                       They also
allowed countries full flexibility to reallocate approved resources in order to reach full
phaseout, in the event that consumption in specific sectors increased or decreased relative
to the baseline scenario.

At the time of preparation of the Bank's project, National Phaseout Plans had not yet
been proposed as an alternative under the MP. The potential size of the Bank's project
was based upon Bank and government projections of potential investment portfolio in the
country, which relied on the country's consumption trends to date, on its strategy for
future ODS phaseout as approved by the Excom, and on the historical involvement of the
Bank in Colombia as one of the four implementing agencies of the MP. In 2002 the GOC
selected UNDP as the agency responsible for updating its Country Program and preparing
its National Phaseout Plan. This effectively eliminated any future investment operations
for the Bank, since with the approval of the National Plan in early 2003, phaseout of all
remaining eligible ODS consumption in Colombia (roughly 1,100 tonnes) was assigned
by the Excom to UNDP. The Cabarria y Cia project approved at the last Excom Meeting
of 2002 was the final individual project that was approved for Colombia before the start
of the National Phaseout Plan3.

The estimates of potential project size made in preparation of the Bank's operation were
accurate given the information available at the time. They were prepared in conjunction
with the UTO and were endorsed by the government. Moreover, they relied on pre-
identified projects prepared through conversations with representatives from the industry.
Most of the subprojects identified in the PAD (i.e. 12 of 18 subprojects) were in fact
implemented. The remaining projects could not be carried out, due to a series of external
factors including, but not limited to:



3The only exception to this was the Prodesal CTC phaseout project that had been under preparation by the
Bank since 2001, and which was explicitly excluded from the National Plan upon request of the GOC.
This project was approved in 2005, and as explained in earlier sections, it was transferred to UNDP in early
2006.


                                                  20

        i) A phaseout schedule implemented by the government that was more accelerated
than that originally planned and outlined in the County Program, which reduced ODS
consumption eligible for phaseout with MP financing
        ii) Changes in MP policies regarding industrial sectors eligible for financing (i.e.
supermarkets). The Excom decision not to finance conversion of supermarkets had a
significant impact on the potential size of the Bank's project. In fact, the PAD had pre-
identified this sector as one of the priorities for the Bank, as consumption by the sector
had been estimated at roughly at 500 tonnes.
         iii) Changing market conditions (i.e. strong economic recession that drastically
reduced industrial output and ODS consumption). The levels of ODS consumption upon
which the Bank's project was designed (i.e. included in the 1994 Country Program)
drastically fell during the recession and never recovered.
        iv) The development of new more cost-effective technologies that reduced the
overall costs of conversion projects.

The project ultimately phased out 255 ODP tonnes out of the maximum projected 596
tonnes, and disbursed 30% of the estimated ceiling. However, more indicative of the
project's impacts and successful outcomes is that 83% of the resources actually
approved by the MLF were disbursed, and that 87% of the approved phaseout was
realized.

7.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at risk status, and
actions taken, as applicable)

The project successfully met its primary objective which was to assist the GOC in
fulfilling its obligations under the Montreal Protocol. This was done, as proposed in the
project document, through a combination of investment and technical assistance
activities.

There were no changes or restructuring of the project. Implementation was carried out as
outlined in the PAD, by financing conversion subprojects in the various ODS consuming
sectors.    In spite of some implementation delays associated for the most part to
procedural difficulties involving individual beneficiaries, the project advanced in a
satisfactory manner. The project's performance was consistently satisfactory. No mid-
term review was conducted and the project was never considered to be "at risk".

In 2003 and after the approval of UNDP's National Plan, knowing that no additional
ODS would be phased out by the project, internal discussions took place to consider
whether it would be prudent to amend the Grant Agreement to reflect the change in the
project's indicative ceiling. At the time it was decided not to amend the Agreement,
primarily for the following reasons:
        a) The project's ceiling had no impact on the country's or the Bank's
             performance with regards to the MPMF.
        b) Amending the Grant Agreement would add unnecessary costs to the project,
             as well as unwarranted processing both at the ACCI and MAVDT.



                                             21

       c) All Bank MP trust funds were set up following the same model and none of
            them had been amended to reflect their actual impact.


7.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

Close M&E of the progress of each individual subproject financed under Montreal
Protocol operations are intrinsic to the way in which the Multilateral Fund and its
Secretariat operate.    After approval of each subproject, implementing agencies are
required to report to the Secretariat, on a quarterly basis, on the progress of each
individual activity. Detailed progress reports including number of beneficiaries, status of
signing of agreements, disbursement levels, phaseout levels, and many other data are
prepared by the country every three months, compiled by the Bank and submitted to the
MPMF Secretariat for scrutiny. All of this information is publicly available on the
MPMF Secretariat's database. If projects are non-performing or if targets are not being
met, the Secretariat (on behalf of the Excom) sends official letters to the countries
inquiring about progress and demanding mitigating action plans. In addition to the
reporting, implementing agencies are required to conduct periodic supervision missions
and to meet with the government to discuss issues involving regulatory controls of ODS
consumption and production, and to inspect delivery of equipment and actual phaseout at
beneficiary enterprises.

Given these requirements, it was therefore absolutely essential for the team working on
this project to keep a close contact with ACCI and the MAVDT and to be informed, at all
times, of the progress of each sub-project. Supervision missions were carried out twice
per year at first, and then at least once every year. The team also met, periodically, with
UNDP team members (either during missions in Colombia or during Excom meetings),
and this allowed to establish coordination between the two agencies.

The project development objective was to protect the stratospheric ozone layer by
providing financial incentives for industrial conversion from ODS to non-ODS
technologies and promote measures which reduce/eliminate emissions of ODS.
Performance indicators measuring progress towards achieving the development objective
included: a) number of subprojects adopting alternative technologies; b) metric tonnes of
ODSs phased out during project implementation; and c) enterprise compliance with
equipment disposal agreements.

Since individual sub-projects were not known at the time of project preparation and Grant
signing, performance indicators were linked to project outcome. Information on these
indicators was included in quarterly progress reports, as well as in Project Completion
Reports prepared by the Bank and the GOC and submitted to the MPMF Secretariat after
each subproject was completed. Completion Reports are particularly detailed documents
that must be approved by the MPMF Secretariat, where all expenses are reported and all
the outcomes of the project are clearly outlined. Any funds that remain unspent after
project implementation has been completed must be indicated in these reports and must
be returned to the MPMF.

7.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

The project was rated as category B because no major environmental impacts or
resettlement issues were expected. The only safeguard triggered was OP 4.01­
Environmental Assessment. According to the Environmental Data Sheet for this project,
participating enterprises were responsible for meeting emission standards, preparing
environmental impact assessments where needed, and obtaining environmental licenses
as required by Colombian law and World Bank environmental guidelines. Because of the
nature of these sub-projects, the impact was so negligible that only environmental data
sheets, but no EIA, were required.

Grant funding was extended under the project to sub-projects to phase out ODS in all
sectors for which the ExCom approved sector guidelines. Under these guidelines, the
ExCom evaluates and approves replacement substances. All expected environmental
impacts therefore were positive. The project dealt with existing enterprises and relatively
small quantities of ODS. Safety issues that were associated with some of the substitute
chemicals or with some other issued were addressed project by project. These cases were
limited but examples included, for instance: i) under the Thermocoil project, the company
was required to prepare (and finance) an evaluation of the potential environmental impact
caused by emissions from the oven received as part of the sub-grant. The company
conducted the assessment and results were approved by the local environmental agency.
Receipt of this endorsed EIA was, in this case, a condition for disbursement of the final
tranche of project financing; and ii) under the Rymco project, the company was also
responsible of demonstrating that potentially toxic exposure to solvent fumes would be
handled through an adequate ventilation system, protective personal gear and employee
training.
Fiduciary compliance was ensured by working with a reputable government Financial
Intermediary (ACCI) that was in charge of all disbursements made under this project.
ACCI staff working on the project was trained both on Bank regulations and on the
specific requirements associated with MP projects (eligibility and fiduciary issues).
ACCI staff was for instance invited to come to Washington once a year, to participate in
annual FI workshops that are conducted by ENVGC. Procedural and project issues, as
well as the latest Excom requirements are discussed during two-day workshops among
staff from every country where MP operations are being carried out.

ACCI also worked in close coordination with the project team, which included
Procurement and Financial Management Specialists. Procurement and FM reviews were
conducted on a periodic basis.

7.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed
by present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and
institutional capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

The MPMF finances incremental operational and capital costs for sub-projects. All
equipment purchased was fully paid for each company (in some cases, firms had to
contribute their own resources). Because incremental operational costs were covered
during the transition to the new technologies, sustainability should not be an issue for any
of the sub-projects.

Sustainability of the project as a whole was also guaranteed by establishing a national
legal framework. A law prohibiting the consumption of ODS in all manufacturing and
consuming sectors, in accordance to MP's phaseout schedules, was drafted by the
MAVDT and reviewed by all relevant government agencies.                The law has been
implemented for some of the ODS-consuming sectors and will be fully in place by 2010.
Companies were given incentives to phase out ODS, and when ODS sectors were clear of
ODS consumption, a norm prohibiting the consumption of these chemicals was passed to
prevent new companies from coming into the market and resuming the use of these
substances.

Finally, regarding institutional capacity, MAVDT had strong ownership of the country
program to eliminate CFCs. The fact that Colombia has been in compliance with the
Montreal Protocol is a good indicator that capacity is adequate at MAVDT. Finally, UTO
continues to be the executing agency for UNDP's national phaseout program, which will
continue until 2010.


8. Assessment of Outcomes

8.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

Colombia's ODS Phaseout Project objectives were in line with the Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS). Most important, the project was developed at a critical time for
Colombia to meet its commitments to the Montreal Protocol. Under the Protocol,
developing countries were expected to reduce their consumption of CFCs by 50 percent
by 2005 and 85 percent by 2007. The project helped Colombia meet the 2005 quota by
contributing to eliminate ODS consumption in four key sectors (MAC, refrigeration, rigid
foams and sterilants). Colombia is presently on track to meeting the 2007 target, as
described in the following section.

8.2 Achievement of Global Environment Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details
on outputs in Annex 4)




                                            24

Project success is deemed satisfactory, as measured by three main indicators. First, the
fundamental objective of the project was to ensure that Colombia could meet its Montreal
Protocol targets to phase out ODS by 2010. The OTF Grant was established to ensure that
Colombia's CFC consumption decreased from a baseline of over 2,200 tonnes of CFC in
1999 to roughly 1,100 tones by 2005, in compliance with its MP commitments. Second,
the results of the individual sub-projects targeted by the World Bank were satisfactory
(255 tonnes of direct impact from 1999 to 2005). Third, the project built institutional
capacity to bring long-term benefits to Colombia, guaranteeing sustainability.

Colombia and its Montreal Protocol Obligations
The Montreal Protocol phase out commitment established three main reduction targets:
the 1999 ODS consumption freeze (national average consumption 1995­1997), a 50
percent reduction in ODS consumption from a 1999 freeze level by 2005, and a complete
phase out by 2010.

Data on ODS consumption in Colombia have been very encouraging since 1994, as
shown in Table 8, to a great extent as a result of the government's commitment to comply
with the Montreal Protocol. Consumption of ODS has decreased consistently over time,
as seen in the table and figure below. The Montreal Protocol called for consumption of
CFCs in Colombia not to exceed 1,100 tonnes in 2005. In that year, CFC consumption in
Colombia was roughly 50% percent below this quota, at 556 tonnes. Colombia is
therefore very well positioned to meet its 75% consumption reduction target, which will
be effective in January 2007.

The projects in which the World Bank was involved have been successful in contributing
to the country's ODS phase out targets. While market forces and government intervention
have also influence this trend, the projects implemented by the World Bank and other
agencies ensured that the conversion to non-ODS technologies was sustainable and
prevented a recurrence of ODS use over the long term. The Bank helped the country to
eliminate 12% of the baseline total ODP tonnes consumption reduction. In many of the
implemented projects, this was done through innovative solutions specifically tailored to
the Colombian context. The GMP and Cabarria umbrella projects, for instance, were
innovative in the way that some of the barriers to SME participation were eliminated (e.g.
insurance deals, tax exemptions, etc) and were ultimately extremely effective in
eliminating a significant fraction of the sector's consumption. The MAC Thermocoil
project was designed in such a way that it eliminated 83% of the country's consumption



                                                 26

in the sector. Grouping the four companies involved in various stages of the condenser
production chain was a particularly effective implementation model. The Rymco project
combined international expertise with local technology to achieve conditions that met
required quality standards under difficult conditions (e.g. environmental and economic).

Success of Sub-projects
The Ozone Projects Trust Fund Grant was successful in contributing to the elimination of
ODS use in Colombia. Projects in the five sectors in which the Bank participated
achieved expected levels of ODS phase out. Table 9 shows the combined impact of the
Bank's intervention in the five sectors.

8.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms,
least cost and comparisons. and Financial Rate of Return)

Montreal Protocol projects do not require a net present value (NPV) or economic rate of
return (ERR) calculation. The main criterion that determines the level of eligible funding
for these projects is cost-effectiveness (CE). Projects' cost effectiveness must fall within
pre-established CE thresholds for the different sectors to be eligible. This means that all
approved MP projects are expected to comply with that pre-set indicator of efficiency.
Table 10 shows the final cost effectiveness per sector.

    (2)Project approved but transferred to UNDP (figures not counted in overall cost effectiveness of
    program)

8.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of GEO, and efficiency)

Rating: Satisfactory
The indicators included in the PAD to measure progress towards achieving the Project's
Global Objective are:
1) Number of subprojects adopting alternative technologies approved by the Montreal
Protocol;
2) Metric tonnes of ODS phased out by the country during project implementation
3) Enterprise compliance with equipment disposal agreements
4) Fulfillment of Colombia's commitments to the Montreal Protocol.

Based on the progress indicators, the project achieved its goals and its progress is
considered satisfactory:

1) Twelve projects were approved by MPMF, including three group projects. The total
number of beneficiaries from the overall program was 43. Two additional projects were
approved by the Excom but were ultimately not implemented (one was cancelled due to
bankruptcy of the enterprise and the second was transferred to UNDP).
2) The project contributed to the direct elimination of 255 ODP tonnes of CFCs. This
represents roughly 12% of the country's baseline consumption.
3) All beneficiaries that owned baseline equipment at the onset of the program were
required to destroy it by the time of project completion. This was a requisite of sub-
project financing, and each destruction process was monitored and certified by a UTO
officer.
4) The country's consumption has been consistently decreasing due to the direct and
indirect work done by the MP implementing agencies, including the World Bank, to
ensure that Colombia is effectively complying with the Montreal Protocol control
schedule. The country comfortably met its 2005 reduction target, is expected to meet its
2007 target, and it is well on its way to reaching total phaseout by 2010.

By all accounts involving the original performance indicators, the project satisfactorily
met its targets. The indicative funding and the phaseout ceilings outlined in the PAD
were not reached for reasons that do not reflect project performance, but rather due to the
specific context of the country and its strategy to meet its targets under the Montreal
Protocol. The long-standing relationship of the MAVDT with UNDP, implementing
investment projects and institutional strengthening activities since the early 1990s had a
major role in their choice of implementing agency to execute the National Phaseout Plan.
This effectively eliminated the need for other agencies to participate in the phaseout, and
limited the even greater role that the Bank could have played. The role of the Bank was
nonetheless critical and has been recognized as such by the GOC. The Bank contributed
to 12% of the overall phaseout, and provided key technical assistance to the MAVDT.

9. Assessment of Risk to Global Environment Outcome

Rating: Low or negligible
The risk to the global environmental outcome would be for Colombia to be in non-
compliance with its obligations under the Montreal Protocol. This risk is considered to
be minimal, and long-term project sustainability is rated as likely. The GOC has shown a
strong commitment to adhering to its Montreal Protocol obligations:
   a) The country has successfully implemented investment and technical assistance
       projects with assistance from the Bank and UNDP, which have over the past 12
       years phased out almost 75% of the countries baseline ODS consumption in key
       industrial sectors. Under the National Phaseout Plan and with assistance from
       UNDP the country is currently phasing out consumption of the servicing sector,
       the final significant consuming-sector in the country. The country is well on its
       way to meet its 2007 reduction target, as well as its 2010 total reduction
       commitment.
   b) The companies that received assistance from the MPMF were granted new
       equipment, training, and in many cases incremental operational costs to ensure
       that they would be successful in their transition from ODS to alternative
       substances. Moreover, old ODS-based equipment was destroyed in all cases, as
       per the requirements of the MP.       It is therefore not likely that any of the
       companies that benefited from Bank or UNDP projects will return to using ODS.
   c) In parallel to the projects and to the National Plan, the GOC has also enacted
       regulation that control imports of ODS in accordance to the reduction targets
       imposed by the Protocol, and this has been an effective method of controlling
       internal consumption. Regulation also controls the use of ODS in manufacturing
       sectors in which ODS consumption has been phased out. Finally, the GOC has
       been actively involved in regional efforts to control illegal trade of ODS
       substances, which has not proven to be as critical in Latin America as in other
       regions of the world.
   d) The Institutional Strengthening project is underway and will be financed by the
       MPMF at least until 2010 and possibly beyond that date. This will ensure that the
       capacity that has been created at the MAVDT (at the central and at the regional
       level) will remain in place until the phaseout of ODS is fully achieved. Public
       awareness events across the country, which have been successfully conducted by
       UTO over the past 12 years will continue to take place until 2010 (e.g.
       International Ozone Day events, radio and newspaper campaigns, Ecological Seal
       to products that protect the ozone layer, program of recycling of old refrigerators
       and others).
   e) Global production of ODS will be phased out by 2010, with the exception of that
       needed to satisfy critical uses that have been granted exemptions. This residual
       consumption will be limited to only a few sectors (e.g. laboratory and analytical
       uses, metered-dose inhalers for asthma patients, and a few others) and it will be
       heavily controlled. The global supply of ODS, which has been dropping over the
       past 20 years will be reduced to virtually zero by 2010. The unavailability of
       ODS in the world market will contribute to supporting the efforts that all
       developing countries have been making to eliminate their consumption of ODS



                                            30

         and it will reduce even further any risks that the GOC does not meet its
         obligations under the MP.


10. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues

10.1 Bank

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)

Rating: Satisfactory
As noted in earlier sections, throughout the project life, Bank staff worked closely with
MAVDT and ACCI to ensure proper identification, preparation, and implementation of
conversion sub-projects. In particular, the Bank staff involved local UTO and other
MAVDT staff in sub-project preparation and implementation. The Bank hired highly
specialized consultants to support the GOC in key areas, such as the design of technically
challenging projects (e.g. Thermocoil, Rymco, Prodesal) and the analysis of market
studies to assess the best strategy for phaseout (e.g process agents and chiller sectors).
The UTO was involved in all aspects of implementation of Bank projects, including
equipment selection and procurement (following Bank guidelines).

The Bank also provided valuable support to the GOC in the strategic policy design (e.g.
specific aspects of the ODS control regulation) and during its negotiations at the ExCom
meetings.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

Rating: Satisfactory
Supervision was adequate, as Bank staff worked closely with ACCI and MAVDT to
ensure the adequate progress of the project. The Bank maintained close contact with both
agencies in order to prepare quarterly reports that were required for submission to the
MPMF Secretariat (e.g. Business Plans, Progress Reports, and Project Completion
Reports). Supervision missions were conducted at least twice per year during most of the
project life and once per year during the final year of implementation. During these
missions, the Bank (accompanied by UTO and ACCI) visited the companies with
projects under implementation and provided guidance and technical support. At the same
time, MAVDT supervised and assisted the companies throughout implementation.

To mainstream Montreal Protocol operations, Project Supervision Reports (PSR), which
were not required earlier, were introduced in FY00. Moreover, during the first phase of
the project, it was not mandatory to elaborate aide memoires after preparation and
supervision missions, but this was done.




                                            31

Procurement post reviews proved satisfactory, as well as financial audits. With regard to
safeguard policies, because project documents were typically prepared in collaboration
between UTO and the Bank, they had to comply with Colombian laws and Bank
environmental guidelines before being sent to the MPMF.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory
The project assisted the GOC in meeting its ODS reduction targets under the Montreal
Protocol. In particular, Bank-implemented projects contributed to the phaseout of ODS
consumption in the refrigeration (domestic and commercial), MAC, sterilization, and
rigid foam. The Bank's proactive involvement to help GOC start implementation was
very important, so that the initial delays could be surmounted and implementation could
advance.

The Bank's involvement of ACCI and MAVDT (UTO) in all aspects of project
implementation helped to build capacity at both agencies (e.g. project identification,
design and preparation, procurement, financial management) and to promote
government's ownership of all of the Bank-implemented conversion projects.

10.2 Borrower
(Check here if the Government and Implementation Agency were the same or
indistinguishable)
The MAVDT (through UTO) was the agency designated by the GOC to execute the
Grant, with the assistance of ACCI, the financial intermediary. All technical, regulatory
and policy related issues were handled by UTO, while the financial and fiduciary matters
were the responsibility of ACCI.

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory
The GOC was responsible for identifying the sub-projects and industrial sectors that
would request funding from the MPMF. With the support of the World Bank and UNDP,
the government established a clear strategy to create awareness of ozone depletion and to
prepare sub-projects in different industrial sectors. The GOC's leadership and vision
ensured that the program developed was appropriate to adhere to the ODS phase out
schedule of the Montreal Protocol.       It's commitment to ensure compliance to MP
commitments guaranteed that the pertinent regulation to control imports of ODS was
enacted and enforced at the national level. It's oversight of day-to-day operations and its
attention detail, crucial for the successful implementation of the type of investment
subprojects financed by the MPMF, warranted the impact that the overall MP program
has had over the past 12 years. Its performance is therefore assessed as satisfactory.


(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory


                                             32

MAVDT's role as implementing agency was satisfactory as the project documents
prepared were done on time and were of high quality. In addition, supervision reports for
ongoing projects were also of high quality and always submitted on time to the World
Bank. The team at MAVDT worked very closely with the World Bank during the whole
project. The logistics for Bank missions were prepared ahead of time by MAVDT for the
World Bank, which made supervision easier.

ACCI's performance was equally satisfactory. ACCI worked close to the Bank and to
UTO to ensure that no delays were caused due to financial management of the MPMF
resources. ACCI's representatives actively participated in supervision mission and in
periodic visit to beneficiary enterprises. They did not limit their involvement to the
financial aspects of the sub-projects, but made an effort to understand the rationale of
each operation, and given the specific conditions of each sub-project to work within their
bounds to facilitate project implementation.

ACCI was responsible for managing the project's Special Account, and accordingly, for
preparing financial management reports that were submitted to the Bank two times per
year.   These were duly reviewed and by Bank's FM Specialists.            ACCI was also
responsible for conducting the required annual audits of the project, which were always
done in a timely and efficient matter. There were no problems of any kind associated to
ACCI's performance of involvement throughout the life of the project and their
performance is therefore rated as satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory
The overall performance of the government during the project is assessed as satisfactory
for the reasons mentioned above. The objectives of the grant were met, and Colombia is
well on its way to phase out ODS completely by 2010.

11. Lessons Learned
(Both project-specific and wide general application)

National and sectoral approaches to phaseout:
The main lesson to be drawn from this and from other MP operations implemented by the
Bank is the importance of considering the overall national picture when tackling issues as
broad as the phaseout of a major raw material such as ODS. One of the main lessons
learned at the level of the Excom is that the project-by-project approach would have
never resulted in the overwhelming success that national phaseout plans have achieved.
The responsibility and the flexibility given to the governments by these types of
performance-based agreements allow them to adapt operations to the specific context of
their countries, as well as to combine policy-level actions and specific investments in the
various industrial sectors.

In the specific case of the Colombia MP operation, the Bank was not the implementing
agency of the National Phaseout Plan. However, the Bank did implement three umbrella



                                            33

projects, which were in many ways the precursors of national plans. In a considerably
smaller scale, these projects focused on ODS phaseout at the sector-level, and made it
possible to address many (for the most part) small beneficiaries under a same operation.
This made it possible to take advantage of economies of scale, which gave the
government enormous flexibility in the choices of technologies and technical assistance
that could be provided to beneficiaries under the same MPMF grant. These projects also
contributed to accelerating the pace of conversion of a given sector: the fact that so many
enterprises were converting at the same time served as incentive to others to participate in
a project that may have otherwise not been attractive. This was particularly important
when considering the size of the beneficiaries, the level of skepticism that in the majority
of cases owners of these firms have towards any type of government involvement, and
thus the difficulties associated with implementation of such detailed operations.

Regulatory support:
The phaseout achieved through investment subprojects would have not been sustainable
if the GOC had not put in place regulation to control and phaseout ODS imports and
manufacturing using ODS. Although in much smaller volumes, ODS are still available
around the world and limited supply will continue until 2010. If the GOC had not
introduced regulation and had not enforced its control on ODS supply, market forces
would have encouraged Colombian enterprises to continue the use of these substances.
The strong commitment of the GOC to comply with its MP obligations, and its
continuous oversight of the regulatory situation were absolutely critical to the success and
the sustainability of the project.

Institutional strengthening:
The specific case of the MP Colombia operation is indicative of the importance of being
the implementation agency that provides institutional support to a government. Through
this project, the Bank effectively contributed to the institutional strengthening of
MAVDT and ACCI. While MAVDT gained considerable experience in negotiation
techniques at the international level and a better understanding of the mechanisms of
several agencies of the United Nations, the UTO gained extensive capacity on project
management and the Bank's procurement and financial management procedures.
However, the agency designated and funded by the MPMF to provide institutional
support to the GOC was UNDP. This allowed UNDP to manage funding of the UTO and
to establish a direct channel to discuss policy advice to the MAVDT. In spite of the
successes of the Bank's subprojects and of its good rapport with the government on MP
related issues, UNDP's relationship with the government was on a different level. UNDP
was ultimately the agency selected to prepare and implement the National Plan.

Bank implementation of Montreal Protocol operations:
The Colombian MP project is one of the first MP operations implemented by the Bank
that has been completed, out of a total of roughly 20 country-based programs. These
programs are atypical by Bank standards, but very successful according both Bank and
MPMF criteria. A few of the noteworthy aspects of this program that has offered insight
into efficient ways of carrying out these operations are listed below:
The timeframe for these projects is typically longer than normal Bank operations, and
progress (as reflected by disbursements) takes place in batches rather than on a


                                            34

continuous basis. This is due to the nature of the beneficiaries of the subprojects, and to
the difficulties in implementing each individual operation. It is important to stress that
the extent of time needed to implement each of these subprojects is dictated not only by
Bank requirements but more precisely by MPMF standards.               Documentation and
reporting requirements under the Fund are extremely strenuous, particularly when applied
to the typical beneficiaries of the projects.    When considering group projects these
requirements multiply and can considerably slow down progress. In the case of the
Colombian project, streamlining and simplifying these requirements, as much as it was
feasible under the MPMF standards, greatly improved the response of small enterprises
and made it possible to complete some of the projects.
Indicative ceilings for disbursements under Grant Agreements have been used for all MP
operations implemented by the Bank. This has allowed the teams flexibility in the
development of subproject concepts and national strategies, without the constraints of
amending legal documents. Although in some cases, such as the Colombian project,
these ceilings are not fully met, this is not a poor reflection on the project performance
but rather an indication of the context of each individual country. Ceilings are estimated
on a sound technical basis and with the full endorsement of the countries, and they may
or may not be met depending on the will of the governments.
Close supervision, but more importantly government ownership of these projects was
critical in ensuring their successful completion. Relatively small problems could delay
implementation for months, and it was the government's oversight that helped minimize
these potential delays.




12. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

Comments by ACCI/Accion Social:

Para Acción Social (antes ACCI) fue muy grato contar con el permanente apoyo del
equipo técnico del Banco Mundial.

La Unidad del Proyecto en el Banco se mostró siempre muy receptiva y dispuesta a
colaborar para asegurar el éxito del proyecto, adicionalmente fue fundamental el apoyo
del Banco en el área jurídica y de desembolsos. Sin el decidido apoyo y compromiso de
los equipos mencionados en el Banco, habría sido imposible lograr el exitoso resultado
alcanzado.

Vale la pena resaltar que para el Gobierno Colombiano, especialmente para Acción
Social, además de los beneficios propios del proyecto, la ejecución de la donación se
constituyó en un escenario de aprendizaje permanente sobre procedimientos y
normatividad del Banco Mundial, lo que resulta especialmente conveniente siendo
nosotros la entidad responsable de la Cooperación Internacional del país.




                                             35

It was very pleasant for Accion Social (previously known as ACCI) to be able to rely on
the continuous support of the World Bank's technical team.

The Bank's project team was always receptive and ready to work in partnership to ensure
the project's success. The Bank's support on legal and disbursement issues was also
critical. Without the full support and commitment from this team it would have been
impossible to achieve the successful outcome of this project.

It is important to note that for the Colombian government, and in particular for Accion
Social, in addition to the intrinsic benefits of the project, the execution of this grant
resulted in a permanent opportunity to learn about World Bank operations and
procedures. This is particularly important given that Accion Social continues to be the
government agency responsible for international cooperation.


Comments by the Technical Ozone Unit ­ MAVDT

"La labor del Banco Mundial en la implementación del Protocolo de Montreal en
Colombia fue muy valiosa para el cumplimiento de las metas de eliminación de SAO,
especialmente para la eliminación del consumo de estas sustancias en sectores como
espumas de poliuretano, MAC y solventes. La implementación de los diferentes proyectos
de eliminación fue eficiente, si bien se presentaron algunos retrasos por los requisitos
que tenían que llenar las empresas para participar en los proyectos (por ejemplo pólizas)
esto no llevó a inconvenientes mayores.

Aunque los requisitos que se exigían a las empresas garantizaban su compromiso y la
implementación del proyecto, asegurando que los recursos invertidos no se perdieran o
invirtieran en actividades ajenas al proyecto, llevaron en algunos casos, sobre todo de
empresas pequeñas, que participantes se retiraran al tener dificultad de cumplir los
requisitos adicionales. Para proyectos pequeños, de bajos montos, recomendamos
analizar la pertinencia de modificar algunos requisitos que lleven a hacer el proyecto
más flexible y permitan la participación de un mayor número de empresas.

En términos generales se puede concluir que el proyecto realizado por el Banco fue
satisfactorio para Colombia en general y para el MAVDT en particular. Las
herramientas aprendidas durante la implementación de los diferentes proyectos se
aplican hoy en día a los proyectos que desarrolla la UTO para la eliminación del
consumo de SAO".



The role of the World Bank in the implementation of the Montreal Protocol in Colombia
was very valuable to achieve the national ODS consumption reduction targets, and
particularly for the phaseout of consumption in the polyurethane foam, MAC and solvent
sectors. The implementation of the various phaseout projects was efficient, even though
there were some delays in project execution, which were mostly related to the
prerequisites that beneficiary enterprises had to fulfill in order to participate in projects
(e.g. insurance policies). However, these delays did not cause major inconveniences.




                                            36

Prerequisites for beneficiary enterprises guaranteed their commitment to the various
projects, as well as the successful implementation of project objectives, by ensuring that
the resources invested would not be lost or used for activities other than those initially
planned. However, in a number of cases, particularly those involving small enterprises,
the burden of these prerequisites was so significant that it forced potential beneficiaries to
decline from participating in projects, as they could not meet all the necessary
requirements.    We would therefore recommend that in the case of small projects
involving a small amount of grant resources, the Bank considers the possibility of
modifying some of its prerequisites for project beneficiaries. This would make projects
more flexible, which would likely lead to a larger number of participating enterprises.

In general terms we can conclude that the project implemented by the Bank was
satisfactory for Colombia, and particularly for the Ministry of Environment. The tools
learned during implementation of the various Bank-executed projects are those that we
use every day in ODS phaseout projects that the National Ozone Unit is currently
implementing.
