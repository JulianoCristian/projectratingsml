The main lesson to be drawn from this and from\n            other Montreal Protocol (MP) operations implemented by the\n            Bank is the importance of considering the overall national\n            picture when tackling issues as broad as the phaseout of a\n            major raw material such as ozone depleting substances (ODS).\n            One of the main lessons learned at the level of the\n            Executive Committee of the Montreal Protocol Multilateral\n            Fund (Excom) is that the project-by-project approach would\n            have never resulted in the overwhelming success that\n            national phaseout plans have achieved. The responsibility\n            and the flexibility given to the governments by these types\n            of performance-based agreements allow them to adapt\n            operations to the specific context of their countries, as\n            well as to combine policy-level actions and specific\n            investments in the various industrial sectors. In addition,\n            the strong commitment of the Government of Colombia to\n            comply with its MP obligations, and its continuous oversight\n            of the regulatory situation were absolutely critical to the\n            success and the sustainability of the project. The specific\n            case of the MP Colombia operation is indicative of the\n            importance of being the implementation agency that provides\n            institutional support to a government. The Colombian MP\n            project is one of the first MP operations implemented by the\n            Bank that has been completed, out of a total of roughly 20\n            country-based programs."}, "docdt": "2006-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
