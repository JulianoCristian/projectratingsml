APPRAISAL CF THE SECOND PakTER DISTRIBUTICN PROJECT
SUNARY
This report appraises a distribution project of the Electricity
Corporation of Ghana (ECG) proposed for construction from 1971 through
1973 and needed to meet the growing derand for power in Ghana. Because
of Ghana's difficult foreign exchange situation, the Government on behalf
of ECG has requested assistance from IDA to finance that part of the
project's foreign exchange costs for which financing has not already
been arranged from other sources. Total project costs are estimated at
US$145. million, with foreign costs of US$10.1 million and local costs of
US$4.4 million. The foreign exchange requirements would be provided by
a US$7.1 million credit from IDA, a US$2.0 million loan from the Federal
Republic of Germany (Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau - KfW), and proceeds
of a US$0.2 million UK loan to the Government, leaving US$0.8 million
representing the cost of equipment already purchased and in stock. This
would be the second IDA credit to ECG; the previous one, Credit ll8-GH
in 1968 for US$10.0 million, was also for distribution.
ii.      ¶To organizations, the Volta River Authority (VRA) and ECG, are
charged with the responsibility for providing public supplies of power.
VRA owns and operates the 588 I'W Volta Hydro Project, which is being ex-
panded to 882 W., and sells power in bulk to the aluminum smelter at Tema
and to ECG, the mines and Akosombo Township.
iii.      ECG serves the residential, commercial and small industrial
demand in the four major cities of Accra, Tema, Kumasi and Sekondi-
Takoradi as well as 26 smaller centers. About 97% of its energy require-
ments are purchased from VRA and about 3% generated with diesels in areas
that as yet cannot be economically connected to the VRA system. The
power market has grown at about 18% annually since 1965, reaching 102 MW
of maximum demnd and sales of 452 GNh in 1969. It is estimated that a
12% average growth rate will be achieved over the next decade and that
maximma demand will reach 246 MI and sales 1,205 GWh in 1978. The project
would help meet ECG's requirements up to the end of 1974; it will be
necessary to make financing arrangements in 1973 for facilities to meet
increased demand from 1975 onward.
iv.       The Borrower would be the Government of Ghana and the Benefi-
ciary ECG. Established in 1967 as an autonomous public utility to be
operated on a commercial basis, ECG has all the necessary powers to con-
duct its operations successfully. ECG is faced with a number of organi-
zational problems, mainly due to the lack of experienced senior staff;
at the same time there is heavy overstaffing in the lower grades. It is
important that additional qualified expatriate engineers be engaged
promptly for the primary purpose of organizing and supervising ECGts own
wiorkforce so as to ensure better utilization of labor, reduce the present
heavy dependence on contractors, and avoid delays in the construction



- ii -
program. The drain on EGG s financial res:urce.s caused by overstaffing
calls for a reduction of abo-ut 30% in the juniox staff and workforce.  To
help achieve this aim ECG has agreed to a reduction of about 600 by the
end of 1973 through early and voluntary retirement, departure of aliens,
and diversion of staff to Government financed projects.
V,        ECG's financial management has improved substantially during
the past year and has achieved satisfactory operating results during the
past two years. Except for an excessive amount of accounts receivable,
the present financial position of ECG is satisfactory.
vi.       Of ECG's financial requirements during the disbursement period
(1970-1974) of the proposed credit totalling N025.4 mlllion, 25% can be
financed by internal cash generation after debt service, 59% by borrowings,
and 16% from other sources (customer contributions and non-operating rev-
enue). This financing plan includes actual construction expenses of
N/24.2 million or 95% ot total financial requirements.
vii.      Ghana's need to borrow foreign exchange for this project is
expected to result in ECG's having a large surplus of local currency
funds. Since there are at present no other requirements for the use of
such funds by ECG other than the expansion plans mentioned in this report,
it would be preferable to return part of the cash to ECG's owner, the
Government so that allocation of such funds could be made on a basis of
overall national priorities. Payment of dividends, early repayment of
the relent amount under Credit 118-GH, and short repayment term of the
proposed project are intended to achieve the objective. The rate of return
is estimated to vary betwseen 7.5% and 8.6%.
viii.     Debt/equity ratio is expected to be 42/58 or better during the
forecast period (1970-1975). In spite of short repayment terms of loans,
the debt service coverage will be 1.4 or better during this period. The
debt/equity ratios, debt service coverages and overall future financial
position of BOG are expected to remain satisfactory.
ix.       The proposed project represents the least-cost means of meeting
the demand for power. The internal financial rate of return on the pro-
posed system expansion has a weighted average of 13.2%.
x.        The project proposed for MA financing is suitable for a credit
of US$7.1 million for relending to ECG at 7W for a period of 7 years,
including a grace period of 2 years.

APPRAISAL (F THE SECCND POJER DISTRIBUTION EROJECT
1.  IRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Ghana, on behalf of the Electricity Corpo-
ration of Ghana (ECG), in early 1970 requested an IDA credit of US$12.8
million to cover the foreign exchange cost of a project consisting of
EGG's 1971-1972 distribution program, whose total cost was originally
estimated at US$18.5 million. As the result of a detailed review during
the appraisal, the 1971-1972 program has been extended to cover the
period 1971-1973 and has been reduced to a total of about US$14.5 mil-
lion. Qf the US$10.1 million foreign exchange content, US$7.1 million
would be financed by the proposed credit, US$2.0 million by a loan from
the Federal Republic of Germany (Kreditanstalt fur Wfiederaufbau - KfW),
and US$0.2 million by the proceeds of a UK loan to the Government;
materials already available in Ghana would account for the remaining
US$0.8 million. The reduction in cost was made possible by the redesign
of systems and the exclusion of uneconomic and umijustified elements.
1.02      This would be the second IDA credit to EOG. The first one --
Credit 118-GH signed on June 14, 1968, for US$10.0 million -- covered
the foreign exchange costs of ECG's 1968-1970 distribution program.
Experience with that Credit has been generally satisfactory, given the
organizational difficulties EGG has faced in changing from a Government
department to an autonomous agency. Because of the lack of supervisory
staff, ECG's workforce has been under-utilized and this has resulted in
construction delays.
1.03      The proposed project, for which the 1968-1970 program provides
a sound base, would cover (a) expansion of distribution facilities in
existing areas of supply, (b) provision of supplies to new areas not
previously served, (c) strengthening of existing facilities, and (d) con-
struction of new lines to connect industries and bring hydro power to
centers now using diesel powJer.
1.o4      This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission
to Ghana in MIy-June 1970 by Messrs. E. A.  Minnig (FPoer Engineer) and
A. N. Memon (Financial Analyst).

2. THE P{aR SECTOR
The Country and Its Econormr
2.01      Ghana, situated on the Gulf of Guinea on the west coast of
Africa, has an area of about 92,000 square miles and a population of
about 8.6 million (1970 provisional census), growing on average at
2.4% per year. The greatest population concentration is in the coastal
areas (2.9 million, excluding the principal cities), the Ashanti Region
(1.9 million, excluding Kumasi), and the principal cities of Accra, the
capital (634,o00), Kumasi (343,000), Sekondi-Takoradi (161,000) and
Tema (103,000). The remaining 2.6 million live in the sparsely populated
Northern and Volta Regions.
2.02      The econony is based on the production of a limited number of
agricultural and mineral commodities. Ghana is the world's leading pro-
ducer of cocoa, the basic crop.  Ivflneral production -- gold, manganese,
industrial diamonds -- ranks second in importance as a source of export
earnings. The main industries are mining, lumber and aluminum smelting.
In addition, secondary industries such as textiles, cement, ceramics,
etc., are becoming increasingly important.
2.03      Gross domestic product (GDP) in 1968, at current market prices,
amounted to about US$2,030 million or about US$236/capita. Since 1957,
the year of Ghana's independence, the economay has grown at a real rate
averaging about 3.6% per annum. In the sixties, the overall growth
rate was lower - about 2.6% per annum before 1966 and 2.14 since then.
Oatput of manufacturing by large-scale establishments employing 30 or
more workers, almost trebled over 1962-68 and this sector now consti-
tutes about 10.5% of GDP. The agricultural sector still supports 60-70%
of the population and is the most important source of foreign exchange
earnings.
Organizations Responsible for the Power Sector
2.04      Two organizations, the Volta River Authority (VRA) and the
Electricity Corporation of Ghana (ECG), are responsible for providing
public supplies of power. To date, they have been able to meet the
demand of domestic, commercial and industrial consumers at reasonable
prices. The mines, which are the principal private owners of gener-
ating equipment (36 MIT, diesel), have placed their equipment on standby
and now use power produced by VRA. Under the Volta River Development
Act (1961), VRA is responsible for bulk supplies to the smelter of the
Volta Aluminium Company (VALCO) at Tema, ECG, the mines and Akosombo
Tolnship. ECG is responsible for the distribution of power throughout
Ghana and the generation of public power supply in areas that as yet
cannot be economically connected to the VRA transmission system.



-3-
Volta River Authority
2.05      Although known since 1915 and investigated on a number of
occasions, the power resources of the Volta River called for development
on a larger scale than would have been justified solely by public demand
for power. In 1956 a Commission recommended that an aluminum smelting
industry be established in conjunction with a power plant. A subsequent
review of this proposal led to the Volta River Project and sponsorship
by Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corporation of an aluminum smelter.
2.06      Exsn Facilities.  The first phase of the Akosombo ponfer
plant (Volta Project) was completed in 1965, a year ahead of schedule
and below estimated costs. Financed in part by a Bank Loan (310-GH for
US$47.0 million), four 147 M units or 588 YiW were installed.  Itudmum
demand served in 1969 totalled about 378 Ni and dependable capacity
amounted to 441 T4W.1/ VRA is currently expanding the Akosombo plant
by adding two further 147 MW units for commissioning in 1972 in order
to meet the increased smelter demand (smelting capacity is now
115,000 t/annum and is being expanded by 30% to 150,000 t/annum by
early 1972), the normal load growth of ECG, and the export of power to
Togo and Dahomey. This will raise installed capacity to 882 I'W, of
which 64o EW 1/ will be dependable. The expansion is being financed in
part by a Bank Loan (618-GH for uS$6.0 million) and will enable VRA to
meet demand until about 1977. VRA also owns and operates a 500-mile,
161 kV transmission system serving the VALCO smelter; ECG systems in the
main cities of Accra, Tema, Sekondi-Takoradi and Kunasi; a number of
smaller towns and villages; and the gold and diamond mines at Tarkwa,
Dunkwa, Obuasi, Konongo and Akwatia.
2.07     Export of Power.  VRA has contracted to supply Togo and Dahomey
with up to 503-flWof power. The necessary double circuit, 161 kV trans-
mission line and terminal facilities from Akosombo to the Togo border
near Lome (85 miles) and on to Cotonou in Dahomey (100 miles) are under
construction and are scheduled for completion by the end of 1972. Fi-
nance is being providod by the Canadiain MYternational Developuent Agency
(CIDA).
2.08      Future Development. The completed Akosombo plant is expected
to meet market requirements up to 1977.  At that time VAICO may exercise
a final option: install a fifth potline and increase its demand from
315 MW to about 390 MJ. To meet this increase along with the normal
growth of demand from ECG and other consumers, VRA will need to provide
additional capacity.- VRA is carrying out a study, financed out of the
proceeds of loan 618-GH, to determine the most economic future develop-
ment. The alternatives being explored are hydro, thermal and intercon-
nection with Nigeria.
1/ Dependable capacity with 4 units installed = 3 x 147 MS or 441 MW.
Dependable capacity with 6 units installed = 5 x 128 1IJ (nominal
output because of fluctuation of lake level) or 640 mw.

Electricity Corporation of Ghana (ECG)
2.09      Uhen the Bank appraised the Volta River Project in 1961, it
was clear that the project's long-term financial success depended on the
future developaent of the non-smelter demand now served by ECG. In the
years 1970-1976, ECG is expected to provide 46% of VRA's revenues, other
non-smelter consumers 1L% and the smelter 40%. As a result, one of the
conditions of Loan 310-GE- for construction of the Volta Project was the
reorganization of ECGts predecessor, then a Covernment department, as
an autonomous public utility to be operated on a commercial basis. This
was accomplished and ECG commenced operations on July 1, 1967.
2.10      ECG's predecessor owned and operated 86.5 W41 of diesel gener-
ating equipment installed in 29 power stations. Details are given in
Annex 1. Nhen VRA commenced supplying power in late 1965, eleven of
these power stations totaling 75.3 MU were shut down or placed on standby.
The 16.5 NtI Accra plant, however, continued to be utilized to meet peak
demand because existing distribution facilities were inadequate to allow
full use of VRA power. This plant was finally placed on standby in May
1969. About 10.8 MI are now in service outside the area served by VRAts
transmission system. By the end of 1973, 69.5 N!1I of diesel equirinent
Will be in service, of wzhich 16.1 MI would supply areas outside the VRA
system, 16.5 Hi in Accra would be on standby, 3.5 2$- would be transferred
to new centers, and the 33.4 MU Tema plant will be recommlssioned in 1971
for peak shaving until VRA commissions the final two units at Akosombo.
2.11      Necessary rehabilitation, reinforcement and expansion of dis-
tribution facilities were prevented for a time by a weak financial
position of ECG's predecessor. In 1966 this work finally got undervlay,
and reconstruction of the Accra distribution system was financed in part
by a loan from the Federal Republic of Germany and British supplier cred-
its.  IDA Credit 118-GH helped provide further improvements at Tema,
Sekondi-Takoradi, Kumasi and smaller centers, while the credit now pro-
posed and the MI'W loan would provide additional facilities to meet pro-
jected load growth of the system to the end of 1974.
Institutional Changes
2.12      The need for two separate power organizations has been con-
sidered at various times and is still under consideration in Government
circles. The creation of VRA in 1961 was justified primarily because
the Electricity Division of the Ministry of W1orks and Housing was not
adequately equipped to undertake the important Volta Project. Upon
completion of this project in late 1965, EGG had not been established
and the utility was still operated as a Government department along non-
commercial lines. Since its establishment in 1967, ECG has had to cope
with important organizational changes at a time when it has been engaged
in an ambitious expansion program. On the other hand, VRA will soon have
completed the Alkosombo powJer plant and is now studying the most economic
future development of its generating facilities for commissioning in 1977.
If an interconnection with Nigeria is feasible, VRA during 1972-1977 would
need to undertake no major construction work, and by 1972 ECG (as more



fully discussed in Section 3) should have overcome its major difficulties
and have no serious problems in coping with its distribution expansion
program. Thus a merger ot the two organizations, EGG and VRA, could be
possible after 1972.
2.13      A merger could have appreciable advantages through combined
service departments (personnel, accounting, transport, stores) and elimi-
nation of duplication of VRA and ECG staff at joint substations. Depend-
ence on expatriate staff could be reduced by better utilization of quali-
fied Ghanaians; construction and maintenance crews could be reduced and
still be able to execute a larger portion of ECG construction work, thus
reducing ECGts heavy dependence on contractors. Such a merger would
require legislation. It would be desirable at the same time to relieve
the newi organization of VRAPs present responsibility for resettlement,
lakeside research, lake transportation, etc., making the new authority
responsible for power activities only. During negotiations assurances
were obtained from the Government that a study will be undertaken and
completed by June 1972 of the benefits and economies that may be obtained
from a merger. If the study indicates the desirability of a merger, the
Government in consultation with the Bank/IDA will prepare an appropriate
plan and timetable for the preparation and implementation of legislation
for the future reorganization of the electric power sector.
Power Utilization in Ghana
2.14      In 1969, total sales of electricity in Ghana were 2,629 GWh or
about 306 kWh per capita, of which VAIJCO accounted for 230 kWh. The dis-
tribution of these sales is shown in the following table.

Rural Electrification
2.15      Proposals for rural electrification have been under discussion
in the Government for the past 10 years. A recently appointed Committee
has selected a total of 53 urban centers in rural areas. Sixteen have
been given priority and eight, requiring an investment of about N01.2 mil-
lion, have been selected for early construction. Since these eight centers
would operate at a loss (estimated at N¢474,000/annum), agreement was
reached during negotiations that for these and any future sub-economic de-
velopments the Government will (a) require ECG to undertake such work only
if ECG's other operations and construction are not adversely affected,
(b) relieve ECG of the financial responsibility for establishing and oper-
ating such centers by appointing ECG as its agent and reimbursing EOG on
a quarterly basis any funds needed for their establishment and operation,
and (c) require ECG to maintain separate accounts for such Government
projects.

3. THE BOCJRRER AND THE BENEFICIARY
3.01      The Borrower would be the Republic of Ghana. The Government
would relend the proceeds of the proposed IDA credit to ECG at 7%
interest for a period of 7 years, including 2 years of grace. A Credit
Agreement would be entered into between IDA and the Borrower and a Project
Agreement between IDA and ECG.
3.02      ECG would be the Beneficiary of the credit.  The Decree estab-
lishing ECG, which IDA reviewed in 1966/67 in accordance with the pro-
visions of Loan 310-GH requiring an autonomous public utility to be set
up, gives ECG all the necessary powers to conduct its business according
to sound commercial principles.
3.03      As discussed more fully below, ECGts basic problem is poor man-
agement. Substantial improvements have been made over the past year in
the accounting field. Due to a lack of supervisory staff, ECG's labor
force has been under-utilized and capital work assigned to it could not
be carried out and has had to be sub-contracted. Procedures for the
appraisal, selection and control of capital works have not yet been im-
plemented. Inventories have been increased to about three times the
required level.
anag,ement
3.04      ECG is governed by an eight-member Board. Ex-officio members
are: the Principal Secretaries of the IMnistry responsible for ECG
(presently the Ministry of Works) and the Ministry of Finance, the Chief
Executive of VRA, and the Managing Director of ECG. Four other members,
including the Chairman, are appointed by the Government for three-year
terms; one of them represents industrial powTer users and another repre-
sents general consumers of powier.
3.05      The present MTanaging Director, appointed by the Government, is
a Ghanaian who previously served as Chief Engineer of the Electricity
Division. Because of senior staff vacancies (see paragraphs 3.06 and
3.07) and also because of his background of direct involvement in system
design, the Managing Director has difficulty in delegating responsibility
and retains more than the required interest in engineering problems. As
a result, he is not able to give adequate attention to the basic problems
with which ECG is faced or periodically to visit regional centers and
the work in progress. During negotiations ECG agreed to appoint a General
Manager by not later than December 31, 1972. For the interim period the
responsibilities of Chief Engineer would be redefined to include the
functions of General Manager. This would relieve the Managing Director
from some of the day-to-day operations thus enabling him to attend to
ECGGs more important problems. During negotiations ECG also agreed to
submit to IDA by the end of 1970 its proposals for providing adequate
management -and for defining the responsibilities of senior staff. Since
Credit 118-GH requires consultation with IDA on the appointment of new
Managing Directors, Chief Engineers and Chief Financial Officers, this



- 8 -
condition was retained. ECG further agreed to consult with IDA on any
appointments to the position of General Manager once this position is
established.
Organization
3.06      ECG's head office, located in Accra, is responsible for overaIl
planning, supervision and general direction of operations. Regional and
district offices are maintained in Accra, Tema, Kumasi, Sekondi-Takoradi
and Tamale. They are responsible for operations, construction, accounting
(including billing) and stores. ECG staff totals 4,782 of wihich 169 are
senior, 985 clerical, 1,373 craftsmen and 2,255 day labor staff. There -
are 69 senior vacancies, of which 5 are in internal audit, 13 in accounmt
ing, 44 in engineering, 2 in commercial and 5 in personnel.  Eleven posi-
tions are filled by expatriates; 7 expatriate positions, all in the
engineering department, are vacant.l/ On the other hand, EGG is grossly
overstaffed with regard to power plant operators and day labor staff.  In
1969, ECG served 94,490 consumers, wzhich gives a ratio of about 1 employee
per 20 consumers. This is unreasonable even allowing for ECG's scattered
operations. Agreement was reached during negotiations on the necessary
steps to solve this problem.  As a first step ECG has agreed to a re-
duction of about 600 by the end of 1973 through early retirement, depar-
ture of aliens, and employment of staff on Government projects.   ECG
should nevertheless aim to reduce its total staff to about 3,000 by 1976
at the latest, which wiould give a more acceptable ratio of about 1 em-
ployee per 50 consumers.
3.07      In general, ECGs organizational structure would be satisfactory
if existing staff vacancies wIere filled with qualified personnel. Agree-
ment on this matter was reached during negotiations and EGG has already
taken steps to recruit from the UYK Southwestern Electricity Board a 6-member
team to be in service by March 1971 for a period of about two years. This
team would also provide training to counterparts selected from 12 Ghanaian
engineers presently attending courses in the UK who are scheduled to return
to Ghana in 1971 and 1972.
3.08      ECG's operations have been and for some time will continue to
be dependent upon expatriates, in the form of consultants or directly -
employed staff. Due to law salaries, ECG has had difficulty in attract-
ing qualified and competent Ghanaians. It was only in 1969 that salaries
were adjusted to levels comparable with those paid by VRA, and some suc-
cess has since been achieved in the recruitment of accountants. In
comparison with the public sector, the new salary scales are high but
they are lower than in the private sector. Agreement was reached during
negotiations that ECG reviewf by mid-1971 salaries and other conditions of
service required to attract essential expatriate staff.
1/ Provided that 20 of the 69 vacancies are filled, ECG's position would
be greatly improved.  ECG has agreed to recruit a total of 14 senior
staff by mid-1971 and steps have already been taken to this effect.



-9-
Financial ,hnagement
3.09      By the end of 1968, ECG's accounting system faced almost com-
plete breakdown because of a lack of qualified supervisory staff. Ac-
counting procedures were not implemented and controls were lax due to
indifference and lack of discipline. Objectives or procedures of ac-
counting were not understood nor appreciated, time spent on jobs was
not properly recorded and materials were inaccurately allocated.  At
IDA's suggestion, a seven-member expatriate accounting team from the UK
was engaged and a. were in service by May 1969. By mid-1969, five key
accounting vacancies were filled on a permanent basis and eight newly
graduated accountants engaged. Substantial progress was achieved in
1969. Accounts for the 18 months ending December 31, 1968, and for cal-
endar year 1969 were prepared and have been audited. The 1969 accounts
were prepared largely by ECG staff, but were subject to final scrutiny
by the accounting team. Billing procedures have improved. Delays of up
to four months between meter readings and billing have been reduced to
between one and two weeks. The accounting controls over billing have
been improved. A credit control department has been established and a
credit control manual detailing necessary procedures is nearing com-
pletion. A fixed assets register and contract ledger have been set up.
Stores catalogs for electrical and mechanical stores and a stores manual,
which are designed to help exercise greater control over inventory level,
have been prepared. Stock-taking is up-to-date. An internal audit de-
partment has been set up under an experienced Chief Internal Auditor,
and the benefits of this department should soon become visible.
3.10      Although much progress has been achieved, it is too early to
form a judgment on whether it will be permanent. The accounting team
is now in process of withdrawing. To ensure against the risk of the
accounts once more falling into arrears, it was agreed during negotiations
that two members of the team be retained until at least September 1971.
This would help ensure that the standards and procedures built up during
the past year are maintained. Also, these two members of the accounting
team could institute a formal training program for ECG staff, assist in
implementing the credit control procedures to reduce accounts receivables,
help prepare the 1971 budgets and up-date the financial forecasts.
Tariffs
3.11      The Decree establishing EGG authorizes it to set tariffs to
ensure that its revenues are sufficient to produce a reasonable return
on the fair value of its assets. The various tariffs are described in
Annex 2. Generally, they consist of a combination of a fixed charge and
a unit charge per kWh consumed. The tariffs are higher in the smaller
centers than in the four major cities. The overall average revenue per
kWh has declined from 3.7 NP in 1961 to 2.9 NP in 1969. If the tariffs
remain unchanged, a further decline to 2.3 NP is estimated by 1974 due
to the increasing proportion of energy being sold on the lower-priced
special load tariff to industry.



- 10 -
3.12      ECG's consultants ( Mssrs. Preece, Cardew & Rider of the UK)
have recently completed a tariff review.  The study, which recomnends
only minor adjustments in tariff structure and rates at this time, is
satisfactory. Adjustments as recommended would not result in signifi-
cant overall change in the level of revenues.
3.13      Credit 118-GH requires ECG to adjust tariffs as necessary to
produce a return of at least 8% on a rate base comprising the average
net fixed assets in operation, plus an allowance for working capital
equal to 5% of the net fixed assets in operation less consumer and Gov-
ernment capital contributions.  This is satisfactory and the same rate
covenant was agreed upon during the negotiations.
Past Earnings
3.14      Despite overstaffing (paragraph 3.06), past operating results
of ECG have been satisfactory.  Revenues from sales of energy increased
from N0ll.9 million in 1968 to N013.0 million or 9% in 1969. Operating
expenses increased from NI8.6 million in 1968 to N010.3 million or 2C%
in 1969, due primarily to substantially higher administrative costs (a
long-needed general salary increase, recruitment for key accounting
vacancies and employment of the accounting team) and to depreciation
expenses (addition of assets). Operating expenses for distribution and
standby stations continued to be high due to overstaffing. The cost of
redundant and idle labor is estimated to have been about NOO.75 million
per year in 1968 and 1969. Rates of return were exceptionally high at
26.3% in 1968 and 14.9% in 1969, due partly to a delay of about one year
in the construction program under Credit 118 -GH, resulting in a lower
rate base than anticipated in both years. Details of the Income State-
ment are shown in Annex 3.
Present Financial Position
3.15      Except for the high amount of receivables, the present finan-
cial position of EGG is satisfactory. ECG's gross fixed assets, which
were revalued in 1967 following devaluation of Ghana's currency, amounted
to N'33.4 million at December 31, 1969, and are reasonably valued.  Assets
at diesel stations, which became redundant with the commissioning of the
Volta Project, have been classified separately in the Balance Sheet (Annex
4) and have a net value of N¢3.5 million.
3.16      The control of accounts receivable has been poor.  Although
monthly bills are payable within 28 days of receipt, accounts receivable
for electricity sales at December 31, 1969, amounted to about N17.3 million
or about 56% of the previous 12 months' billings. Receivables on Gov-
ernment accounts were especially high, amounting to about N02.6 million
or about 13 months3 billings.  State Corporations and Iocal Councils
owed about N¢2.0 million or about 10 months' billings, and private con-
sumers N12.7 million or about four months' billings.
3.17      In order to settle past arrears and facilitate prompt settle-
ment of future power billings, the Government agreed during negotiations



- U1 -
that it would by May 31, 1971 (a) permit ECG to offset NAh.08 million
owed to ECG for power consumed by the Government, its agencies, the Ghana
Broadcasting Corporation and local administration through June 30, 1970
and by state corporations (other than the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation)
through June 30, 1969 against amounts owed by ECG to the Borrower in
respect of Credit 118-GH; (b) establish a centralized payment facility
for prompt settlement of amounts owed to EGG for power consumed after
June 30, 1970 by the Government, its agencies and local administrations;
and (c) devise a system to ensure immediate payment of (i) any amounts
referred to in (b) above which are not paid by such centralized payment
facility within 90 days after presentation of the respective bills; and
(ii) any amounts owed to ECG for power consumed after June 30, 1970 by
the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation and not paid within 90 days after
presentation of the respective bills.
3.18      ECG has recently established a credit control section under an
experienced Assistant Chief Accountant to deal with state ccrporations
and private consumers not covered under the above arrangement. The objec-
tives of this section are to (i) continue to improve billing procedures in
order to dispatch bills in no more than two weeks; (ii) review and super-
vise disconnecting, reconnecting and court collection procedures; (iii) com-
pile and update a list of all outstanding debts by categories and ages;
and (iv) vigorously enforce disconnecting policy for any consumers more
than 90 days in arrears.
3.19      The settlement of Government arrears (paragraph 3.17 (a)) and
the establishment of (i) the centralized payment facility backed by a
support system to deal with the Government consumers (paragraph 3.17 (b)
and (c)); and (ii) credit control section under a high power executive
with defined objectives (paragraph 3.18), are expected to result in sub-
stantial improvement of ECG's accounts receivable position. ECG will
report per.-iodically on the pro-ress achieved.
3.20      Gross value of inventories (including an accumulated obsolete
stock provision of NV0.8 million) amounted to N03.8 million, which is
excessive. A substantial part of the inventories is obsolete. ECG has
agreed to dispose of obsolete stocks; the Income Statement (Annex 3)
shows the anticipated loss, amounting to N1'0.935 million.  In addition
to the agreed disposal, ECG agreed during negotiations to reduce the
inventories to about N01.0 million by December 31, 1973 which is reasonable.
3.21      The Government equity has increased from N017.9 million in 1967
to N024.7 million in 1969, due primarily to the revenue surplus retained
during the period. The debt/equity ratio is 38/62, which is satisfactory.
3.22      The long-term debt consists of (a) IDA Credit 118-GH of
US$10 million (1968) relent to ECG at 6V  for 20 years including 3 years
of grace; (b) the EfW loan of DM20 million (1966) for the distribution
network in Accra, at 5ig for 20 years including 3 years of grace; and
(c) several supplier credits, all incurred before 1967, at interest
rates of 6-5/8% and higher, the unpaid amount being N03.2 million.



- 12 -
Taxes
3.23      ECG is exempt from income tax.  It is also exempt from all
duties and sales taxes for an initial working period of 10 years, up to
June 30, 1977.
Insurance
3.24      Present insurance coverage of ECG -- including protection
against fire, explosion, earthquake, third party liability and workmants
compensation -- is satisfactory. Assurances were obtained during nego-
tiations that ECG will increase its insurance coverage year by year,
commensurate with the expansion of its activities and the increase of its
assets in service.
Audit
3.25      The Decree establishing ECG requires it to have its books and
accounts audited each year by an auditor appointed by EGG's Board with
the approval of the Government's Auditor-General.  For this purpose ECG
has utilized the services of Cooper Brothers (Ghana) Limited, a subsidiary
of a UK firm. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that ECG
will continue to employ independent auditors satisfactory to IDA and sub-
mit annually certified financial statements, accompanied by the audj.tor's
report, within six months after the close of the fiscal (calendar) year.

4. THE PROJECT
Background
4.01      The necessary rehabilitation, reinforcement and expansion of
distribution facilities were prevented in the early 1960's by a weak
financial situation (paragraph 2.11). Although consultants (Lahmeyer A.G.
of the Federal Republic of Germany) were employed by the Government in
1963 to redesign the networks of the four main centers and priorities
were assigned, it wras not until 1966 that work finally got underway. The
first work to be undertaken was rehabilitation of the Accra system, fi-
nanced in part by a EfW loan and British supplier credits. IDA Credit
118-GH provided the foreign exchange required to rehabilitate and expand
the three other major systems. With the conmissioning of these works by
the end of 1970, the major rehabilitation work will be completed, thus
providing a base on which to plan future expansion.
4.02      Future investment requirements covering the period 1971-1982
are estimated at N055 million or on average N05.0 million per year.
The 1971-1973 portion will require investments of about Nl14.8 million,
providing the basis of the project proposed for IDA financing.
Description
4.03      The project covers ECG's distribution program for the years 1971
through 1973. It would consist of: expansion of the four main systems of
Accra, Tema, Sekondi-Takoradi and Kumasi; expansion of smaller systems; es-
tablishment of new centers at Berekum, Konongo and Ipraeso; construction of
33/11 kV overhead lines; buildings for stores, regional offices, workshop
and personnel housing; supply of service line materials; construction and
service vehicles; meters, tools, workshop instruments and testing equipment;
and office machinery and furniture. The project also includes the foreign
costs of engineering, management assistamne and training services.
Cost Estimate
4.04      The estimated costs shown below for the project outlined above
are based on actual quotations that have been received after international
competitive bidding for nearly all of foreign purchases. The costs are
considered reasonable. The reason for early tendering was to achieve
continuity in construction (1966-1970 and 1971-1973 programs) and to retain
the construction and installation momentun that has finally been achieved.
Since the cost of nearly 100% of the foreign purchases is based on actual
firm bids, the contingency allowance corresponds to about 4%. This al-
lowance will cover unforeseen items and is considered reasonable. Local
currency expenditures, mainly for installation and civil works, have a
contingency allowance of about 2.5% for unexpected items and a 10% al-
lowance for increases in local prices corresponding to an estimated annual
local cost escalation of about 5%. These rates related to total costs
give a 3.2% physical contingency and a 2.8% price contingency allowance
as shown in the summary cost estimate below. Should there be any foreign
exchange savings on the project, these would be cancelled and the credit
reduced accordingly.

Procurement and Disbursement
4.05      Procurement for 90% of the foreign exchange component of the
Project is being carried out on the basis of international competitive
bidding in accordance with IDA's Guidelines.  The exceptions are: (a) pro-
curement in the Federal Republic of Germany to be financed by the
Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) (N¢790, 000 (US$775,000)) because of
the need for matching equipment for part of the Accra system previously
constructed with German equipment financed by KfW; and (b) procurement in
the UK of accounting machines to be financed out of the proceeds of a UK
commodity loan to the Government (NO200,000 (US$195,000)) for which ECG
would repar the Government in local currency on demand. The balance of
N01,210,000 remaining from the KfW Loan of NI2, 000,000 would be available
on an untied basis. Specifications and tender documents for nearly 100%
of the equipment proposed for IDA financing have been prepared, reviewed
by IDA, issued, and bids received. Bid evaluation is completed, but no
contracts will be awarded prior to consideration of the proposed credit
by the Executive Directors. Qn the basis of bid evaluation 20% would be
procured from the Federal Republic of Germany; 14% from the UK; 10%g from
Italy; 11%, from Belgium; 214% from Yugoslavia; 9% from Sweden; 7% from
Ghana; and the balance of 5% from Switzerland, Austria and India. Pref-
erence for domestic suppliers has been requested by the Government and -
affects one Ghanaian company manufacturing bare copper and aluminum con-
ductors. The value added through local manufacture averages 26% of the
cost price. Since the import duty on such materials is 50%, a 15% pref-
erence to local manufacturers has been agreed for purposes of bid evalu-
ation. Disbursements for any local purchases would be made only for the



- 15 -
cost of the imported component. Par other items purchased abroad, dis-
bursements would be based on the CIF costs of equipment and materials and
on the foreign exchange cost component of erection and services as speci-
fied in the contracts. In the case of foreign engineering, management and
training staff, disbursements would be based on the foreign exchange cost
component of the services as specified in the contracts. Annex 9 shows
the estimated disbursement schedule.
Construction Schedule
4.06      Construction in Accra and Tema is scheduled to begin in mid-
1971 for completion by early 1973. In Kumasi and Sekondi-Takoradi, the
schedule calls for construction to begin in late 1971 with completion in
Yarch 1973. The smaller systems are scheduled to start in early 1972 and
should be completed by the end of 1973. All other works are scheduled
for completion by the end of 1973. These schedules are based on past
experience and are realistic.
Engineering Consultants
4.07      (i)  Electrical.  Lahmeyer A.G. (Federal Republic of Germany)
has acted as ECG's consultant since 1963. The firm is
under contract to assist EGG until the end of 1971 to
prepare specifications and tender documents, review ten-
ders, supervise installation of cables and equipment, and
assist with conmissioning. The present contract is being
revised and extended to the end of 1973. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that ECG will continue to
employ electrical engineering consultants on terms ac-
ceptable to IDA.
(ii) Civil. For the design of civil structures (mainly sub-
stations), ECG has employed the services of local con-
sultants. Arrangements are satisfactory and assurances
were obtained that ECG will continue to utilize the
services of civil engineering consultants on terms ac-
ceptable to IDA.
Management Consulting and Training Services
h.o8      The management consulting services of Cooper Brothers & Co.
(UK) have been utilized since 1965. Cooper Brothers also provided the
accounting team discussed in paragraphs 3.09-3.10. Agreement was reached
during negotiations that two members of this team would remain until at
least September 1971.

5. JUSTIFICATICN
5.01      The main justification of ECG's expansion program is the need
to meet increased power demand especially for industrial use. In the
past, 1962-68, gross manufacturing output by establishments employing
30 or more w¢orkers has trebled from US$70 million to US$215 million,
representing about 10.5% of GDP in the later year. This trend is esti-
mated to continue.  In addition, domestic value added by small and medium
industries, employing 1-9 and 10-29 persons, was estimated around US$34
million and is expected to grow in coming years. Nevertheless, only known
newf industries were included in the load forecast.
5.02      Since the agriculture sector supports 60-70% of the population
and is the most important source of export earnings and because it is the
Government's aim to increase such exports, the extension of power supply
in the larger urban centers of rural districts and the establishment of
power supply in selected centers presently writhout a public power supply
are planned. Investments for this purpose account for about 10% of total
investment requirements.
The Power Market
5.03      In 1969, ECG served the four major cities of Accra, Tema,
15umasi and Sekondi-Takoradi and 26 smaller centers (see Map), of which
16 have locally generated diesel power, Out of a total population of
about 8.6 million (1970 census), only about 1.5 million or 17% enjoy
the benefits of a public powier supply.
5.04      Past Development, 1965-1969.  Sales increased from 233.7 GI,h
in 1965 to 451.6 G1'Jh in 1969 at an average annual growth rate of 17.9%.
Distribution losses amounted to 73.3 GWh or 23.9$ in 1965 and 72.1 GOh
or 13.8% in 1969. The high losses in 1965 wrere due partly to the bad
state of EOGts distribution system and partly to inaccurate metering and
illegal connections. Progress has been achieved in metering, but the
low-er losses in 1969 are mainly due to system improvements commissioned
in Accra in early 1969. In 1965 the maximwm demand was 63.8 I14, increas-
ing to 102.0 141 in 1969 at an average annual growth rate of 12.5%. In
the same period, the average annual load factor improved from 55.0% to
58.5%.
Foat Develoet970-197
5.05      Pbwer will be supplied to three new areas:  Berekum (diesel)
and Konongo and IMpraeso (supplied with VRA power). Saltpond, Akwatia
and Oda -- presently supplied with diesel energy -- will be connected
to the VRA system. The forecasts of demand in all centers were prepared
individually and only firm new industrial loads were taken into account.
5.06      ECG s total sales are estimated to increase at an average annual
rate of 11.5%, from 451.6 GlWh in 1969 to 1,205 Gih in 1978.  This is sub-
stantially below the grawth rate of 17.9% achieved during the 1965-1969



- 17 -
period.  Since only kIown industrial sales have been included, the fore-
cast is likely to prove conservative. To meet the forecast sales, ECG
by 1978 will have to generate or purchase 1,377 G14h. Cf that amount,
1,337 Gl1h or 97% will be purchased from VRA and 40 GWh produced locally.
Losses are estimated at 172 GWh in 1978 or 12.5% of total energy avail-
able for distribution.  Maximum demand is estimated to increase to
245.5 MW in 1978, and the average annual load factor is expected to
improve to 64.0%.
5.07      Analysis of sales by tariff classification for the period 1965-
1969 showed that the domestic category has lost its predominant position-
dropping from 43.5% of total sales in 1965 to 34.0% in 1969. It is fore-
cast to decrease further to 27.4% in 1978. The special load category
(industrial use), however, has increased its share of the market from
25.2% in 1965 to 39.8% in 1969; it is forecast to increase further to
52.9% by 1978. Of the incremental demand during 1970-1975, about 43 MW
or WSi is attributable to nor industrial loads -- mainly at Tema, Ghana's
principal port and industrial center which accounted for 16.9% of ECG's
total sales in 1965, 26.7% in 1969, and is forecast to reach 34.7% in 1978.
Further details on the load forecast are given in Annexes 10 through 14.
Internal Financial Rate of Retum
5.o8      The program presented in this report shows an internal financial
rate of return averaging 13.2%. Each independent system was analyzed and
the following internal financial rates of return were found: Accra, 16.3%;
Tema, 9.2g; Kumasi, 13.0%; Sekondi-Takoradi, 13.7%; smaller centers served
with VRA energy, 12.3%; smaller centers served with diesel energy, 11.7%;
and 33/11 kV transmission lines not associated with the above, 14.4$i.
5.09      Ihese rates of return are satisfactory.  In the case of Tema,
there are two reasons that contribute to the relatively low rate. First,
Tema is a new system and to achieve overall economies some investments
need to be made now to serve future demand. The primary distribution
system will be constructed for 33 kV operation but operated at 11 kV until
1974/75; the benefits of this will not become fully apparent until sub-
sequent phases. In the calculation of benefits it was considered prudent
not to include future possible benefits of such early investments, but
rather to present the situation on the unlikely assumption that no future
expansion of the system would be made after 1973. This conservative
approach is also reflected in the load forecast, where only known industrial
sales were included. Second, the predominance of special load industrial
tariff sales at Tema results in lower benefits than at the other centers
where the proportion of the higher tariff sales (domestic, commercial and
special rate) is larger.
5.10      Although the load forecast as presented is considered conserva-
tive, the effect of a 10% reduction in revenue on the internal financial
rate of return was deternined and found to result in a drop in the average
rate from 13.2% to 12.0%. Such a rate is still satisfactory. The project-
as presented represents minimnm investments consistent with sound engineer-
ing practices to meet forecast demand. Design and construction arrange-
ments are satisfactory.

6. FINANCING PLAN AND FUTURE PROSPECTS
Proposed Financixg Plan
6.01      ECG's financing plan for 1970-1974, the period during which
disbursements for the proposed IDA credit will be made, is summarized
below. Of the total requirements, 25% is estimated to be covered by -
internal cash generation after providing for debt service, 10% by con-
suwer capital contributions, 59% by borrowings, and 6% by other sources.
The N01.54 million represented as other sources is derived from activi-
ties other than the sale of electricity, such as interest on cash de-
posits. It may be noted that the proposed project accounts for only
slightly more than half of the construction during the period, the rest
being completion of wrork financed under Credit 118-GH and purchases for
the next phase of construction starting in 197h.

Details of Sources and Applications of funds through 1975 are shown in
Annex 15.
6.02      The borrot¢ings included in the financing plan are-
(a)  The proposed IDA credit of US$7.1 million equivalent, with
assumed relending terms of 7% interest and repayment over
7 years including 2 years of grace;



- 19 -
(b) a iKm  loan of US$1.96 million equivalent to the Government,
to finance the foreign exchange cost of the development program
in Accra, with assumed relending terms of 7¼V interest and
repayment over 7 years including 2 years of grace; and
(c)  a draw-down of N12.1 million from future foreign loans for
the nexb stage of ECG's expansion, with assumed terms of 74
interest and repayment over 20 years including 4 years of
grace.
ECG's comfortable cash position is the justification for the short re-
lending terms of the proposed IDA credit and KfW loan.  This is further
discussed below (paragraphs 6.07-6.09).
6.03      Agreement was reached during negotiations on a subsidiary loan
agreement between the Government and ECG, under which the proposed IDA
credit wll1 be relent to ECG on terms substantially similar to those
mentioned in paragraph 6.02 (a).
6.04      Arrangements satisfactory to the Association have been made
for the provision of the KfW loan to the Borrower. It is understood
that the Government will relend the proceeds to ECG on terms substantially
similar to those mentioned in paragraph 6.02 (b).
6.o5      Assurances were obtained from the Government that, in event of a
shortfall of funds to complete the project, it will make arrangements
satisfactory to IDA to provide ECG with the necessary funds to complete
the project.
Financial Outlook
6.06      Revenues from electricity sales are estimated to increase from
N013.0 million in 1969 to N%22.9 million in 1975 at an average yearly
rate of 10%. Operating expenses are estimated to increase from N'10.3
million to N019.5 million at a rate of 11% per year during the same
period.  The decline in operating margin is primarily due to an increase
of 10% in the cost of purchased power from VRA in 1970. The rate of
return is estimated to vary between 7.5% and 8.6% during the period; this
is satisfactory. The estimated return of 7.5% during 1971 and 7.6% during
1972 is below the required 8%; but with a small improvement in operating
results as compared with the forecast, EGG should be able to earn 8% or
more. A tariff ir.crease at this time would be inappropriate.
6.07      Ghana's need to borrow foreign exchange for the project is
expected to result in ECGts having a large surplus of local currency
funds during the 1970-1975 period. There are at present no proposals,
other than the present and future expansion program mentioned in this
report, *uhich can be economically justified for the use of these funds by
ECG. It would therefore be preferable to return part of the local cur-
rency earnings to ICG's owmer, the Government, in the form of dividends



- 20 -
so that allocation could be made on a basis of overall national priorities.
The level of such dividends could be varied according to ECGts operating
results and its need for cash year by year.  Under the present forecast,
they would total N¢8.38 million by 1975 and would amount to approximately
2% return on equity in 1970, increasing to 4% in 1972 and levelling off
at about 7% by 1973. ECG stated during negotiations that it intends to
declare appropriate annual dividends from its earnings starting in 1970
after making adequate provision for working capital, future expansion,
replacenent of assets and amortization of debt.
6.08      In view of its healthy cash position, ECG has agreed to repay
the amount owTed the Government under Credit 118-GH by December 31, 1980,
instead of December 31, 198'3, as previously scheduled.  This is desirable
for overall economic recsons as discussed above.
6.0o      Even after making provision for the next phase of its expan-
sion plan, paying dividends, early repayment of monies relent from
Credit 118-GH and agreeing to short amortization period of the proposed
credit and MT loan, ECG is expected to have comfortable cash balances
throughout the forecast period.
6.10      Debt/equity ratio is expected to be 42/58 or better during the
1970-1975 period. Debt service coverage will vary between 2.6 in 1970
and 1.4 in 1973. These debt/equity ratios and debt service coverages
are satisfactory.  Balance Sheet projections are shown in Annex 4.
6.11      To ensure that the present satisfactory financial position will
be maintained throughout the term of the subsidiary loan agreement, a
long-term debt limitation has been included in the credit documents.
Assurances were obtained that ECG will not incur any debt without prior
IDA approval unless its net revenues for the fiscal year preceding such
incurrence, or for a later 12-month period ended before the incurrence,
will be at least 1.5 times the maximum debt service for any succeeding
fiscal year on all debt, including the debt to be incurred.
Construction Expenditure Limitation
6.12      To ensure completion of the project and the best use of availa-
ble resources, assurances were obtained during negotiations that during
the period 1971 through 1973, when the proposed IDA project would be
implemented, ECG will not undertake any construction or expansion not
included in the project except (i) Government financed projects; and
(ii) other projects involving aggregate annual expenditures not exceeding
N00.5 million.

7. RECXIENDATIONS
7.01      During credit negotiations, agreement was reached on the follow-
ing principal points:
(a) The Government agreed to:
(i) Cause a study to be undertaken of the benefits and
economies that may be obtained from a merger of ECG
and VRA and, if this study indicates the desirability
of a merger, to take prompt and effective action for
implementation (paragraph 2.13);
(ii) require ECG to undertake rural electrification only
if EGG's other operations are not adversely affected
and in any event to relieve ECG of the financial
responsibility for establishing and operating such
newr centers (paragraph 2.15); and
(iii) permit ECG to offset monies owed by the Government for
power consumed against the relent amount to ECG of
Credit 118-GH, and to establish a centralized payment
facility for settlement of future transactions (para-
graph 3.17); and
(b) ECG agreed to:
(i) Take steps necessary to solve its problem of over-
staffing (paragraph 3.06);
(ii) retain two members of the accounting team until at
least September 1971 (paragraph 3.10); and
(iii) not to undertake any construction not included in the
project except Government financed projects and other
projects involving aggregate annual expenditures not
exceeding NtO.5 million (paragraph 6.12).
7.02      The following principal issues were also discussed and suita-
ble assurances obtained from ECG:
(i)  Proposals for providing adequate management (paragraph 3.05);
(ii)  establishment of a credit control section to improve accounts
receivable (paragraph 3.19);
(iii) payment of annual dividends to the Government (paragraph 6.07);
and



- 22 -
(iv) early repayment of monies relent to ECOG by the Government from
Credit 118-GH.
7.03      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA
credit of US$7.1 million to the Government to be relent to ECG.

Analysis of Past and Forecast Genei'ation, Sales, I4.dimum Demand
1.        Sales forecasts utilized in this report have been prepared on
the basis of past development with allowances made for known new indus-
trial loads. Industrial developments in the pre-negotiating stage have
not been taken into account since these in general could readily be con-
nected to the distribution system. This approach is conservative but
justified because of factors presently influencing Ghana's economic
development. The forecast as presented will therefore require periodic
revision as new information becomes available.
Past Development 1965-1969
Sales in Total
2.        ECGts total sales increased from 233.7 GVJh (1965) to 451.6 GIh
(1969) at an annual average growth rate of 17.9%. Most of this growth
however was achieved in the later part of the period under consideration.
Because of Ghana's economic difficulties in 1965 and 1966 when the growth
rates of GDP at constant prices were (-3.4%) and 0.3% respectively, energy
sales increased at below average rates of 10% and 14% respectively. In
1967 and 1968, however, energy sales growth rates of 19.0% and 23.256 were
achieved partly because of the effect of distribution rehabilitation and
expansion works carried out in 1966-1968 and also due to the improvement
of economic conditions.
Generation, Purchased Power and Losses
3.        To meet the above sales ECG generated by diesel and in September
1965 commenced to purchase bulk hydro energy produced by the Volta River
Authority (VRA) at the Akosombo Power Plant. In 1965 generation and energy
purchases totalled 306.8 GETh of w^Jhich diesel generation accounted for
224.2 GEMh and VRA power for 82.6 Gwh. In 1969 the respective figures were
523.7 GUh total, 20.0 GUh diesel generation, and 503.7 GVJh VRA power. Thus
the average annual growth rate of power available for distribution amounted
to 14%. Distribution losses amounted to 73.3 G1Th in 1965 or 23.9% of the
total available and in 1969 72.1 GJh or 13.8% of the total, Distribution
losses were high in 1965 due to a large extent to the bad condition of
distribution facilities but also because of inaccurate metering and illegal
connections. Progress has been achieved in metering but the reduction in
losses as a percentage of energy available in 1969 is mainly due to dis-
tribution system improvements achieved in Accra.
Maximum Demand
4.        In the same period under review maximum demand increased from
63.8 MW (1965) to 102.0 MJ (1969) increasing at an average annual growth
rate of 12.5%.  The average annual load factor improved from 55.0% to 58.3%.

Sales by Area
5.        ECG's main market is concentrated in the 4 major cities of Accra,
the capital city (population 662, 800 (1970))S Tema, principal port and
industrial area (80,100); Kumasi, the capital of the Ashanti Region
(404,500); and Sekondi-Takoradi, port and naval base (203,700).  The total
below shows maximum demand and energy sales for the four main centers and
the minor centers.

In 1965 sales in the 4 major centers accounted for 91% of total sales. In
1969 this percentage had increased to 91.8%. The market area served by VRA
hydro energy accounted for 96.4% in 1965 increasing to 96.9% in 1969. Thus
diesel generation presently accounts for only 3.1% of ECG's total sales.
6.        The change in sales pattern especially the substantial increase
of Tema both as a percentage of total sales (16.9% to 26.7%) c.nd the above
average growth rate (32.0%) is attributable to its developmaent as GhanaIs
principal port and industrial center.  Newr major industries established in
the period were: Aluminum Smelter (supplied with powter by VRA), steel mill,
oil refinery, textile plants and several small manufacturing enterprises.
Sales by Tariff Classification
7.        ECG's sales are classified in 7 categories.  They are: domestic
(residential); commercial lighting (offices, shops, factories); commercial
power (commercial and small industrial use other than lighting), special
load (large power consumers - industries, universities, main hospital, armny

organizations); flat rate; and street lighting. Sales in these categories
have developed as follows.

8.        The domestic category has lost its predominant position in the
market dropping from 43.5% of total sales in 1965 to 34t.0% in 1969.  In
the same period the special load category, as a result of larger loads
being served, has increased its share from 25.2% to 39.8%. In 1969, 49%
of the special load sales were made in Tema alone. Flat rate and street
lighting use in the period under review showed no growth because slot
meters were eliminated in 1966 and because investments required for street
lighting projects - the responsibility of the municipalities concerned -
were not available.
Future Development 1970-1978
9.        New Industrial loads
Accra: Trade Fair: 1971, 1974 and 1977
Yaximum demand 1.0 14W, Energy consumption 0.8 GWh;

Present factory demand is about 1.8 Mi. Increased
sales to the textile plant for which contracts have
been signed are 10.0 Glh in 1970, and 37.0 GWh in
1972. Present plans are to double boiler capacity
in 1972 which could raise consumption to 55 GWh in 1972
and 73 GMJh in 1973. The prospects of textile factories
in Ghana are good depending, however, on the availa-
bility of raw materials;
Juapong Textile Factory: The present requirements of
this factory are 700 kW and 3.5 GNh/annuxn. Expansion
is planned to 4.5 MW and 31 GWh/arnum from 1971 on-
wards;
Asustare Irrigation: Initial demand is estimated at
1.0 NW rising to 2.0 NW utilizing 4.0 GNh in 1971;
6.0 GI-h in 1972; and 9.0 GNh in 1973 and thereafter;
and
experieental Farm: With a maximum demand of 300 kW,
0.4 GWh are expected to be utilized in 1970 and 0.8 GWh
in 1971 and thereafter.
Kumasi: Barekese Water Works:  Already connected to the ECG
system by means of a 33 kV overhead line. Maximum
demand is estimated at 5.0 MW with sales of 5 GlWh in
1970; 11 GWh in 1971; and 17 GWh in 1972 and thereafter.
Sekondi-Takoradi:  Naval Base:  Maximum demand in 1971 of 1.6 NW
rising to 3.5 1in 1974.  Energy consumption is esti-
mated at 1.0 GlNh in 1971 and 3.5 GWh in 1974 and there-
after;
Inchaban Wlater Wlorks: Ya.xinum demand 0.8 M1 in 1970
rising to 2.5 MWI4 in 1975 requiring a consumption of
3 G1Nh in 1970 increasing to 16 GNh in 1975; and
Daboasi Water Works: Maximum demand is estimated at
1.2 MIT and consumption at 4 GWh in 1970 and 7 GW3h in
1971 and thereafter.
Cape Coast: Lime Juice Factory: Yaximum demand 0.6-1.0 IWI.
Energy requirements 0.3 GWh in 1970 rising to 0.8 GUh
in 1972; and

Hospital:  1cimum demand 500 kWJ with energy consumption
rising from 0.3 GTNh in 1971 to 0.7 GWh in 1975; and
Brewery: 1bximum demand increasing from 200-300 kl with
energy requirements of 0.5 GNh in 1970 rising to 0.8 GWh
in 1974.
Bolgatanga: Vea WJater VSorks: Itoimum demand 200 kW with energy
requirements of 0.3 GNh in 1971 rising to 0.7 GWh in
1973; and
Meat Processing Factory:  Ma.ximum demand 200 kW with
energy requirements of 0.4 GINh in 1971 increasing to
1.0 GWh in 197h.
10.       The forecasts were prepared center by center, allowances made
for new residential areas to be served and increased sales as a result
of rehabilitation work currently under progress. The above listed new
industrial loads were included and a modest allowrance made for the expan-
sion of existing industries served. The results are described below.
Sales in Total
11.       ECG's total sales are estimated to increase from 45i.6 GWh in
1969 to 1,205 GWh in 1978 at an average annual growth rate of 11.51.  This
is substantially below the annual growth rate of 17.9% achieved during the
1965-1969 period. The reason for this is that only known industrial sales
have been included in the forecast. As mentioned in paragraph 1 above this
approach is conservative but justified because of the uncertainty of future
economic development. As new information becomes available the forecast
will have to be revised and kept under constant review.
Generation, Parchased Power and Losses
12.       To meet the forecast sales ECG will by 1978 be required to gen-
erate or purchase 1,377 GWh. Of this anount 1,337 GOh or 97% will be
purchased from VRA and 40 Gth generated by diesels.  Thus the average
annual growth rate of generation and purchases for the period 1969 to 1978
would be 11.3%.  Losses in 1978 are estimated at 172 GI1h representing 12.5%
of total energy available for distribution. Reduction in losses are mainly
due to further improvements of distribution facilities and are considered
reasonable.
Maximum Demands
13.       Yaximum demand is estimated to increase to 246 IW in 1978 at an
average annual growth rate of 10.1% for the 1969-1978 period. The average
annual load factor is estimated at 64% for 1978 improving slightly from
58.3% in 1969.

1/ IlLnor centers served with VRA hydro energy.
2/ Minor centers served with diesel energy.
Thus in 1978 sales in the 4 major centers are expected to account for 92.1%
of total sales compared with 91.8% in 1969. The market served by VRA energy
in 1978 is expected to account for 97.2% of total sales increasing slightly
from 96.9% in 1969. Temats share of the market shows an increase from 26.7%
of the total in 1969 to 34,7% of the total in 1978 due to its further
development as the main industrial area. The average annual growth rates
1969-1978 show a marked decline from the historic rates 1965-1969 due to
factors previously described in paragraphs 1 and 11 above. Nevertheless,
although conservative, the growth rates are considered to be reasonable
reflecting present economic conditions.

ANNEX 12
Page 7 of 7 pages
Special load sales are estimavted to increase from about 4O%0 in 1969 to
about 53% of total sales in 1$78. Domestic sales and commercial power
sales hozever lose their shave of the market decreasing from about 34.0%
in 1969 to about 27ro in 1978 and from about 16% to about 12% respectively.
The growth rate of domestic sales is forecast to fall below the historic
rate as suppressed demand is met in the early part of the period and
growth in later years includes only increased use by existing consumers.
The forecast industrial growTth rate (special load) is substantially below
the historic rate because no information is available on new industrial
loads after 1973-1974 and the increased consumption after 1974 represents
only estimated increased use of existing industries. Commercial light and
power are expected to maintain the historic growth rates as new office
buildings, both government and private, are completed and as smaller enter-
prises that previously could not be connected are provided with power. As
postponed street lighting projects are carried out consumption for this
purpose is estimated to double in the nine years under review. Even if
such projects do not materialize the estimated increase of 2.7 GMh repre-
senting less than 0.3% of ECG's total sales by 1978 has no significant
effect on the forecast. Further details on historic and forecast devel-
opment of ECG's power market are given in Annexes 11, 12, 14 and 15.
