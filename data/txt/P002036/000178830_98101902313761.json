Annual enrollment is expected to\n            total about 560. Project components would include civil\n            works related to campus development, together with the\n            provision of furnishings, equipment and vehicles. Management\n            of the Institute would be contracted to an international\n            firm or consortium of firms experienced in management\n            training. This firm would provide 24 man-years of technical\n            assistance to fill six senior staff positions at the\n            Institute. In addition, it would be responsible for\n            establishing and operating the Institute, recruiting senior\n            staff, training Nigerian teaching staff and establishing an\n            evaluation system. Another project component would consist\n            of fellowships for training up to 24 teaching staff outside\n            Nigeria. In addition, 25 man-months of support consultant\n            services would be contracted to assist with course\n            development work, evaluate program results and advise on\n            future development of the facilities."}, "docdt": "1979-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
