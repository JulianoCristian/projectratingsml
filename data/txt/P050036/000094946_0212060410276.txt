1. General Description
1.1 Project Background
1.1 Project Source
The proposed (Erjun Road) Wuwei-Huanggu highway section is one of the highway
maintenance component of Anhui province applying for the World Bank loan. This
subproject is selected from more than 400 highway sections totaling 8000km long,
based on the comparison conducted by Anhui Provincial Communications
Department of China. The criteria of selection for the highway maintenance
subproject are  (I ) Beneficial to the economic development in the poverty stricken
areas; (2) Favorable to transportation centralization and decentralization of the main
route (Hefei-Anqing Highway ) ; (3) Fitted for the provincial 10th five-year plan of
highway improvement, and priority given to the sections which have started
construction and completed tasks of subgrade widening or land acquisition under the
9gt five year plan so as to improve efficiency of the whole route and the highway
network; (4) The existing road sections cannot meet the increasing demand for
transportation and need rehabilitation. (5) The average indicators (PQI) of road
surface quality are low and surface is poor.
(Ejun Road) Wuwei-Huanggu section is located in the south central areas of Anhui,
on the bank of downstream of Changjiang River, where the major transportation relies
only on road for there is no railway to reach these areas. Therefore the improvement
of road surface and the increase of the communication capacity directly relates with
the local economic development and people's living quality. As the economy develops
and the transportation increases, the existing road of low grade, narrow surface and
poor quality cannot match the demands of economic development and transportation.
Thus, Anhui Provincial Communications Department is applying for the World Bank
loan (remaining savings) to support the rehabilitation of (Erjun Road) Wuwei-
Huanggu highway section. The project area is in the joint section between riparian
economic zone and Changjiang River and Huai River economic zone, where there is
huge potential for the economic growth. The project construction shall benefit
regional social and economic development, not only for providing necessary
conditions but also laying solid foundation. Therefore the project is so urgent and
important for Wuwei County and is expected to start very soon.
According to the requirements of "Environmental Protection Management Rules of
Projects under Construction  253id order of the State Council, and "Environmental
Assessment" (OP4.01 ) of the World Bank, Anhui Provincial Highway Administration
Bureau entrusted the job to Hefei Design & Research Institute, Ministry of Coal
Industry, of environmental assessment and preparation of the environmental impact
assessment on (Erjun Road) Wuwei-Huanggu section of highway maintenance
1.1.2 Status of Enviromnental Assessment
For the sake of fulfilling the task seriously, the assessment unit, after accepting the
entrustment, set up an environmental assessment group in July 2001. The group
I



together with Anhui Provincial Highway Administration Bureau, Chaohu Municipal
Highway Administration Bureau, Wuwi County Highway Administration Branch, and
Anhui Provincial Highway Survey and Design Institute carried out field visits and
public participation and consultation along (Erjun Road) Wuwei-Huanggu highway
section in July - August, 2001. The staff conducted deep field investigation relating
environmental status and environmental sensitive objects (schools and hospitals)
along the section. Based on the site visits, data collection and further study of the
project feasibility study report and under the direction and assistance of the
environmental experts from the World Bank Beijing Sector, the group worked out the
draft "Environmental Impact Report of (Erjun Road) Wuwei-Huanggu Section of
Highway Maintenance Component of the World Bank- financed Anhui Provincial
Highway Project of China" , combined comments from consultants. Now the draft
report is submitted to the World Bank for review.
1.2 Aim of the Environmental Assessment
The report shall make qualitative or quantitative anticipation analysis and assessment
on the possible environmental impact to be brought by the project construction, on the
base of the investigation into the natural and social environment and environment
quality within the assessment range of Luan-(Erjun Road) Wuwei-Huanggu
section, and combined with the understanding of the environmental status and relative
environment issues along the section. The report shall point out the potential problems
and propose effective and reasonable alleviating measure correspondingly. The
alleviating measure shall be put into practice to reduce the environmental impact
during the project construction and operation to the lowest degree. The following
targets shall be reached as well.
( 1 ) Possible environmental impact during the construction as well as the impact
range and degree shall be fairly and objectively identified.
(2 ) Investigation result shall be presented in the report based on the understanding of
the public opinions via the investigation along the section.
(3 ) Various measures of prevention, alleviation and reduction to the lowest degree of
the negative impact shall be proposed, established on the result of environmental
impact anticipation and applicable compensation methods shall be proposed as well.
The aim is to identify negative impact before the construction, raise attention in
finalizing the design document and bid contract, and carry out the alleviation methods
during the construction period.
(4 ) The environmental assessment shall work as decision making reference,
provided to the highway administration departments and local government institutions
along the section in making environmental administration plan and environmental
development programs.

2. 4 Project Name and Construction Nature
Project name: S319 (ErJun Road) Wuwei -' Huanggu Section of Highway
Maintenance Component.
Construction Nature: "Improvement" of road surface
Widening road and promoting road grade is classified as "improvement" set out in
"Technical Standard of Highway Maintenance" of China. Accordingly (Erjun Road)
Wuwei-Huanggu section belongs to the construction of "improvement", meaning
the construction shall be carried out on the existing road subgrade for improvement.
However the construction shall not require any land acquisition and not involve with
any resettlement of structures. For most of the section crosses farming land, the
"improvement" shall allow water to pass through irrigation culverts or ditches
involved. Thus, the design of the project does not consider the construction quantity
of culverts.
2.5 Basic Process of Surface 'improvement" Construction
The construction of the project shall not require any land acquisition and not involve
with any resettlement of structures. But the environment of building new bridges shall
be involved. Chart 2-2 shows the basic process of surface "improvement"
construction of (Erjun Road) Wuwei-Huanggu highway section.

The project of "improvement " shall concentrate on the surface pavement (including
bottom base course, base, surface). Stones, sand, cement and asphalt shall be the
major building materials and procured in the market. The environment issues
produced by the sand pits and stone pits is the business of the owners who is
responsible for the rehabilitation of its ecological environment according to relative
regulations. The project would not consider the environmental problems caused by
sources of the materials of sand and stone pits.

3.1 Natural Environment
3.1. I Topography
S319 (Erjun Road) Wuwei -Huanggu section is located at Jianghuai Plain, where
terrain is smooth and flat and crossed by canals and ditches. The ground height is
5.5-20.0m. Most land is used for farming. Road is flat too.
3.1.2 Meteorological Phenomena and Climate
Climate of Anhui province belongs to the transition zone between warm temperate
and sub tropical climate. Wuwei County belongs to northem sub tropical zone with
moist monsoon climate. The sunshine hours of the normal year amounts to 1718.6 -
2288.3 hours. Average frost-firee period reaches 247 days. Normnal rainfall is 1045 -
1300mm. The area has the climate features described as evident monsoon, clear four
seasons, changeable spring, rainy summer, clear and crisp autumn, cold winter. The
climate is suitable for the growth of wheat, oil crop, bean that prefers cold weather
and proper for the growth of paddy rice and cotton that prefers warm weather on the
contrary. Table 3-1 shows the major meteorological parameters of Wuwei County.

Note: Data are extracted from national economic statistics of the year 2000 of Wuwei County
3.1.3 Soil Vegetation
Yellow and brown soil is the main soil of the local soil type and the paddy soil is the
second.
The whole area is classified as the vegetation belt mixed of deciduous leave,
broad-leaved evergreen and coniferous forest. There is little natural vegetation due to
the long time of human activities. At present, most existing vegetation on both sides
of the road and around houses are planted, namely white poplar, ailanthus,
pagoda-tree, locust, platen, paulownia; Farming crops are wheat, paddy rice, bean, oil
crop, peanut, cotton, vegetable, melon and fruits.
3.1.4 Soil Erosion Status
China is one of the countries that lose soil and water seriously. As it is published, the
lost soil and water has reached 367 X 104km2, accounting for 38% of the total land,
among which, soil erosion of Changjiang River amounts to 62X 104km2, occupying
16.9% of the total.
According to the class of soil erosion type of China, Wuwei County belongs to
14



southern red soil hilly area, having hydrodynamic erosion as the main feature. It is
identified in the data provided by Wuwei County Water Resource Bureau, local soil
erosion modulus is 1 lOOt/km2 . a, ranking as slightly eroded. The soil loss volume
exceeds SOOt/km2 * a of soil unit loss allowance set out by the state.
3.1.5 Water Resources Status
Wuwei County is rich in water resource. Changjiang River passes through 103km of
the county. Yongan River and Huadu River cross the whole county. The normal yearly
total surface water volume is 0.965 billion m3 excluding 0.9317 billion m3 passing
through from Changjiang River and Cao lake. S319 (Erjun Road) Wuwei -Huanggu
highway section crosses over three major rivers, which data are shown in Table 3-2.

the project design The difference is I .891m.
3.2 Ecological Environment
3.2.1 Natural Ecological Environment
The project is located in the slight hilly areas of Jianghuai Plain and Huaibei Plain
where the history of human activities is very long and there is not any group of large
sized wild animals or large belt of natural vegetation. There is few rare wild animals
or vegetation to be protected in this place. Various man-planted vegetation and small
wild animals such as frogs, snakes and insects could be seen within 200 m away from
the highway.
Coniferous evergreen and deciduous leaf forest are the major trees, namely, cedar,
Japanese black pine, masson pine, Chinese sweet gum, locust tree, tung trees,
paulownia, metasequoia, elm, poplar etc. Arbors are planted in the town and villages
along the road and nearby, such as poplar, platen, paulownia, elm and metasequoia.
The implementation of the project would not involve any land acquisition and
15



resettlement. There would be little impact on ecological environment of natural
vegetation along the highway.
3.2.2 Agricultural Ecological Environment
Most area of Wuwei County is farming land. The main crops along the highway are
paddy rice, wheat, oil crop, corn, sweet potato and cotton and there is also forest in
some areas. The crop output is usually high due to the suitable climate and rich soil
and convenient irrigation. The paddy rice output is 500 kg/mu. The wheat output is
about 300 kg/mu. The oil crop output is about 150 kg/mu. The corn output is about
400 kg/mu.
The people living nearby raise livestock and fowls, including pigs, cattle, sheep,
chicken, ducks and geese etc.
The raised aquatic products of the project areas are fishes like bighead, silver carp,
crucian, carp, grass carp, crab, shrimp and turtle.
Besides, there are some tea gardens, fruit trees of peach, pear, apple and so on. Local
farmers plant various vegetables as greens, peppers, pumpkins and white gourds etc.
The implementation of the project would not involve with any land acquisition and
resettlement. There would be little impact on the agricultural ecological environment,
natural vegetation and ecological environment along the highway. Certain amount of
trees shall be destroyed for the construction and would be replanted once the
construction is completed in accordance with the designed greening program.
3.3 Social Economic and Traffic Status
The project shall impact the areas of Chaohu City and (Erjun Road) Wuwei County
The basic information of the project areas is shown in table 3-3.
Chaohu City and Wuwei County take agriculture as the main production. The
township enterprises are less developed, which focus on light industry and agricultural
side products. Local farmers' income is low, at the average of 1900 yuan/a-2100
yuan/a.

Note: The data are extracted from Statistics in 2001 of Chaohu City.
According to "Anhui Provincial Statistics in the year 2000" (see Table 3-2), Wuwei
County is listed as state poverty stricken area. Its per capita GDP is lower compared
with per capita GDP of Chaohu City and Anhui province. Per capita GDP of Anhui
16



province, Chaohu City and Wuwei County are compared in the table 34, which
shows per capital of Wuwei County only accounts for 74% and 74.18% of the
province and Chaohu City respectively. Less developed transportation is thought as
one reason for the low GDP of the county. The project is believed to create more
opportunities for local farmers to enter the market and participate in the competition
so as to get rid of poverty.

Note. Anhui Provincial per capita GDP is extracted from "Anhui Provincial Statistics in 2000"
Highway is the main way of the transportation in Wuwei County. The project is
believed to greatly improve the existing transportation capacity, increase the flowing
in and out of the goods and people, bring more opportunities to the poor countryside
with less developed communications, in particular, to benefit social and economic
development along the highway.
The transportation relies on the highway in the county, although there is transportation
by navigation. It is known from the investigation that all the administrative villages
have roads connecting the highway of city and county, and have access to electricity
and telephones as well. The local municipal and county governments always lay
emphasis on water conservation, so agricultural irrigation system is so good to have
certain capacity of flood control and drainage and resisting against drought.
3.4 Living Quality
The investigation shows that municipal and county governments pay much attention
to education. Around 99 % of proper aged children are educated in the school.
Various social resources and channels are mobilized to promote people's cultural
knowledge. In addition to the schools set up by the governments, all kinds of training
classed are held to update people's skill and capacity.
There are 5 middle schools, 7 primary schools and 1 clinic. The clinic contains 20
ward beds and cures common diseases. Serious patients must be sent to city /county
hospitals. In the past, patient's safety was greatly challenged subject to inconvenient
transportation. The road improvement could better the healthy condition of rural
residents and benefit the immediate save of serious patients in this sense.
3.5 Natural Resources
The main mine resources of Wuwei County are coal, iron, copper, zinc, gyp, lime and
white alum etc., about 10 kinds in total. Coal storage amounts to 30 million tons; iron
storage amount, 50 million tons; and white alum amounts to about 15 million tons.

4. Environmental Status Investigation and Assessment
The environment and its status has been conducted and monitored along the highway,
including industrial pollutants and special environment along the highway. Hefei
Municipal Environmental Monitoring Station, on entrustment, has monitored
environment quality of environment noise, environment air and surface water relative
with sensitive points from   Jan. 22, 2002-Jan. 30. The distribution of monitoring
points is shown in Drawing 4-1.

Table 4-1 shows the finding of monitoring on major sensitive points. The environment
noise of daytime and nighttime is 49.7-56.2dB          (A) and 36.5-41.3dB         (A)
respectively. The noise basically meets the limit of Class I stipulated in
"Environmental Noise Standard in Urban Areas" (GB3096-93) except for Changba
Primary School exceeds the limit by 1.7dB (A) at daytime So the quality of
environment noise along the highway is good.

4.1.2 Environment Air Quality
Wuwei Shushan Middle School and Shili Town Xiangtaqiao Primary School were
selected as representatives along the highway to be monitored for the assessment of
environment air. Wuwei Shushan Middle School is located in Shushan Town along the
highway. The monitoring result could represent the environment air quality of the
sensitive points in the towns along the way. Xiangtaqiao Primary School is in a
village surrounded by farming land. The monitoring result could represent the
environmental air quality of sensitive points on the banks of the highway. The
monitoring lasted 3 days. Sampling was taken 4 times a day. Table 4-2 of monitoring
record of environmental air status shows the daily concentration value of TSP and
hourly concentration values NO2 and CO meet the limits of Class 11 (see standard
value of Table 1-5) set out in "Environment Air Quality Standard" (GB3095-1996).

4.1.3 Status of Surface Water Environment Quality
Monitoring was conducted on the surface water of three rivers relative with the
project. Table 4-3 shows the monitoring record of the monitoring. Since rivers are
mainly used for irrigation of farming, the Class V (see Table 1-5) of water body
classified in the "Surface Water Environment Quality Standard" (GHZB1-1999) is fit
for the standard of the three rivers, according to the water quality program of Wuwei
County Environmental Protection Bureau. The three rivers are proved below the
limit of Class V (see standard value of Table 1-6) classified in "Surface Water
Environment Quality Standard".

4.2 Investigation into Industrial Pollution Generators
According to the investigation into industrial pollution generators, there are not any
large sized constant industrial pollution generators along the highway, except for
some small brickyards, township agricultural side products processing plants
(small-sized) and social service sectors. Due to the poor surface of the highway, much
instant TSP is produced when vehicle passes by. This impacts air environment of the
highway to some degree but the impact is limited. Meanwhile, air whistle loud
speakers are used frequently so that noise dB exceeds the limit instantly.
43 Special Environment Investigation
According to the investigation along the highway and consultation with Wuwei
County Cultural Relics Administration Sector and Wuwei County Forestry Bureau,
there are not any natural protective zones, cultural relics, historic sites and wild
animals and plants which need protection, within 200m away from the central line of
the highway. Further investigation shows there is not any natural protective zone
within 20km away from the highway either. Wuwei County Cultural Relics
Administration Sector and Wuwei County Forestry Bureau presented the documents
for evidence. See Annex 2 and Annex 3.
However, in case any buried ancient graves or historic ruins are discovered, the
contractor shall have to report to local cultural relics and historical site administration
departments. The contractor shall not go on constructing until relative departments
complete concerned work.
The evidential documents of the investigation provided by relative units are attached
to the report.

5. Forecast and Evaluation of Potential Environmental Impact
5.1 Construction Period
The construction type of S3 19 (ErJun Road) Wuwei-Huanggu section is classified as
"improvement", that is, to widen and reinforce the road surface and subgrade, with
asphalt macadam to pave the road surface. During the construction period, the
existing width of the subgrade is 7m and is designed to widen to 12m with a length of
49.726m. The project does not involve in land acquisition and settlement. During 2
years' construction period, the construction will have some impact on the nearby
environment.
5.1.1 Impact on Acoustic Environment Quality
5.1.1.1 Impact of Mechanical Noise on Both Sides of the Highway
During the construction of S319 (Erjun Road) Wuwei-Huanggu section, various
machines and vehicles would be used. The main machinery contains shovel loaders,
road rollers, paver buckets and dumpers that would make unavoidable noise during
the construction. Dumpers are used to transport construction materials like
cobblestones, sand and concrete, which would increase the traffic volume and impact
to a larger scope. Table 5-1 shows the noise levels of various machines and vehicles.

As most of the section passes through part of the towns and villages, during the
implementation of the project, the noise of construction and traffic would impact the
life quality of the residents, schools and hospitals on both sides of the road.
S319 (Erjun Road) Wuwei-Huanggu section covers a whole length of 49.726km,
crossing the areas of Huanggu, Shushan town, Quantang town, Xiangan town, Taqiao,
Shilidun town, Wuwei county, Wangfudu town and etc. The schools and hospitals
within 200m away from the road are presented in the following Table 5-2. The
schools, hospitals and sensitive points of noise impact on both sides of the road is at
the distance of 50-120m to the road center
There are just a few houses on both sides of the highway, and most are used for
commerce. Therefore, the people directly affected by the noise are few and temporary.

Attenuation type of point sound source would be applied considering the types of
machines and their noise. Vehicles for transportation would be regarded as sound
source in the construction. The following Table 5-3 is the estimate of noise level
generated by main machines and vehicles to different distances during the
construction.
"Noise Limits of Construction Site" (GB 12523-90) stipulates: noise of construction
site is limited to 70-75dB     (A)     in the daytime and 55dB      (A)    at night. Table 5-3
shows that the affected distance is within 40m by daytime and the distance beyond
40m in the daytime meets the regulated noise limit. At night, the distance beyond
200m can basically meet the noise limit.

According to the investigation, 12 middle and primary schools and I clinic will be
affected within the distance of 30m- 1 Oim by the noise on both sides of the road of
S319 (Erjun Road) Wuwei-Huanggu section. Thus, the construction noise in the
daytime might generate slight impact on schools and hospitals. The distance of impact
at night is as far as 300m. Therefore, the strong noise of machines is forbidden at
night in the places adjacent to hospitals.
5.1.1.2 Impact of Mechanical Noise from the Mixing Station on the Environment
The asphalt mixing station will be set up at the maintenance squad during the
construction. On the investigation of the site, there are no environmental sensitive
points (such as schools, residential areas, sanatoriums or hotels) to be protected within
100m. Based on the analogy monitoring to the mixing station by Hefei Environmental
Monitoring Station, the actual tested noise values are shown in Table 5-4.

standards
The actual tested values show the noise values of the asphalt mixing station (40m
away from the boundary) are 53.4-54.6dB      (A)   in the daytime and 41.9-44.8dB
(A) at night at the places 1.Om from the boundaries. So the noise values both in the
24



daytime and at night are lower than the "Noise Limits for Site Boundary of Industrial
Enterprises" (GB12348-90) Class I.
However, by the estimate, the environment noise of the mixing station can meet the
requirements of "Urban Areas Environment Noise Limits" Class I. Thus, it is believed
in the evaluation that the noise will not impact the environment and people nearby.
5.1.2 Impact on Environment Air Quality
5.1.2.1 Impact of Road Dust on Air Environment
During the construction period, the flying dust is mainly caused by the wind erosion
on the bare road surface. The flying dust depends upon the travel speed of the vehicles
passed by, the wind speed, the dust volume on the road and the dust humidity, among
which the wind speed directly depend on the transmission distance. According to the
monitoring to the Beijing-Tianjing-Tangshan Highway in the construction period by
the Highway Institute of MOC, the analogy monitoring to the flying dust in the
similar condition is shown in Table 5-5.
TSP of the Construction Road
Table 5-5
Distance to the road (m)  0       20         30        100       200
TSP density  No watenng  3.64     0.95      0.38      0 28      0 18
(mg/rl)    Watering    0 70      0.46      0 22      0 20      0 10
Table 5-5 shows that the necessary watering will reduce the flying duct 50%-80%
during the construction. The impact on air environment will be distinctly decreased
And the TSP density at the distance 30m leeward can meet the "Environment Air
Quality Limits " (GB3095-1996) Class II.
5.1.2.2 Impact of Tai Gas on Air Environment
As the transportation increases, the NO2 and CO in the tail gas by vehicles increase as
well. According to the monitoring data of this highway, the average density per hour
of NO2 and CO is 0.005 -0.046 mg/mr3 and 2.55-4.17 mg/m3, which meet the limits
of the "Environment Air Quality Limits" (GB3095-1996) Class II. Therefore, it can
be said that the NO2 and CO in the tail gas by the increasing vehicles will not pollute
the air environment on both sides of the road.
5.1.2.3 Impact of Asphalt Mixing Station on Air Environrment
It is planned to lay 553300 m2 of asphalt on road surface. When mixed and paved, the
major pollutants are THC, TSP and BaP. But it would be much less when paved than
mixed. According the analogy monitoring, the closed decocting technology will keep
the density of BaP less than <0.0001 11 g/m3 at the distance 50m leeward, lower than
the standard value 0.01 11 g/m3 in the "Environment Air Quality Limits"
(GB3095-1996) Class II. Little of TSP and THC will be produced. Therefore, the
25



major pollutant is BaP when mixed. As long as the station is kept 50m away from the
sensitive points and residential areas, the asphalt lampblack will not impact the air
environment. On considering the weather and other factors, it is suggested in this
evaluation that the mixing station should be set up at the distance of 100m leeward
away from the sensitive points, towns or villages.
5.1.2.4 Impact of Construction Campsite on Air Environment
The main pollutants in the construction campsite are TSP and SO2 from the cooking
stoves. As the campsites use the house of the maintenance squad and it is in the wild
field, and there are a small number of workers, the impact on the air environment is
slight.
5.1.3 Impact on Ecological Environment
The implementation of this project is to widen and reinforce shoulders of the existing
road into road surface, there would be little impact on the biological environment.
Some weeds on the shoulders and part of bush vegetation would be cut and destroyed.
Around 3500 trees might be cut in the course of widening the road. There is not any
grassland along the road. Since no land acquisition occurs, vegetation of farmland on
both sides of the road would remain the same as before. The vegetation beyond the
both banks of the road would be protected through stressing the environmental ideas
among the workers to reduce the impact to the lowest degree.
In addition, some TSP pollutants would be generated due to the mixing of surface
materials during the construction and would land on the vegetation and leaves of
crops. Thanks to the rich rainfall in this area, the TSP landed on leaves would be
rushed away with the rainwater and would not stay long, the impact on the growth of
plants is negligible.
5.1.4 Impact on the Surface Water Environment
During the construction period, the impacts on the water environment involve in the
following aspects: the residential wastewater and garbage in the construction campsite,
the wastewater of washing machinery and the dropped machine oil in maintenance,
and the watering when rolling the road.
5.1.4.1 Watering in the Construction
During the works of rehabilitation of surface, water content would be kept for surface
reinforcement in the rolling to reach the required degree of enforcement. Limited
water would be used for the mixing of reinforcing materials and rolling. The water
would be absorbed quickly by materials of surface and leave little water into the side
ditches and farmland. Consequently there is no impact on water environment.
5.1.4.2 Residential Wastewater in the Construction Campsite
There are 3 contract sections in this project, and each has set upl campsite, so there
are 3 campsites. On the basis of the existing construction rules, each section has about
40 workers. The water used is limited, for there is no bathroom in the campsite and
the toilet without water (dry toilet). In the investigation to the actual water
26



consumption in the Hefei-Anqing Highway, the maximum water used is about 60
lip/d, that is, the water consumption in each campsite comes up to 2.4m3/d and the
wastewater is about 2.0m3/d. Therefore, the residential wastewater has a little impact
on the surface water. As long as necessary measures are taken, the impact on water
environment can be reduced to very little.
5.1.4.3 Wastewater in Washing Machinery and Dropped Machine oil in Maintenance
When the machinery needs repairing and washing in a rainy day, the water used is just
a little. Generally it can go directly into the ground, with little impact on the surface
water.
There is no maintenance station in the construction, and all the repair work is done at
the maintenance shops in the city or county. As result, no dropped machine oil in the
construction site will impact the surface water. If any oil is dropped on the ground, it
must be picked up and get burned.
5.1.4.4 Residential Garbage in the Construction Campsite
The residential garbage of the workers is rather little. It amounts to about 20kg in each
campsite in term of 0.5kg/p/d. It will be classified and treated in different ways.
Therefore, the residential garbage will not impact the surface water environment with
proper measures taken.
5.1.5 Impact on the Irrigation System
As the project works on the rehabilitation of road surface, no river is involved.
However, the road will pass across some of the irrigation system in the farmland. As
the subgrade matches the road surface that will be widened, the irrigation canals don't
need increasing in length. As long as attention will be paid not to block the ditches,
canals or culvert with the construction materials so as to let the water through, the
construction will have no impact on the water environment and the irrigation system.
5 1.6 Impact on Soil and Water Conservation
This project lies in hills. On base of the "Standards for Classs and Grades of Soil
Erosion" (SLI90-96) by the People's Republic of China, it belongs to southern hills
with red soil. The allowable loss of soil and water is 500t/km2 . a. Owing to the
rehabilitation of the existing road surface, the affected area is small, and the soil
erosion caused by loss of soil and water in the construction is temporary and not
serious. According to the documents provided by Wuwei Irrigation Bureau, the soil
and water erosion modulus in this area is lOOt/km2/a, and the total volume of soil
and water erosion will amount to 686t in this construction.
5.1.7 Impact on Traffic in Bridge Construction
5.1.7.1 Impact on Traffic
The major rivers passed by this project are all seasoning rivers, except that the Xi
River and Huadu River have water with the width of the water surface 20-30m or so
in winter. The rest rivers flow almost dry in winter. The vehicles can go roundabout
way when Fudu Bridge is repaired on Xi River. And a new bridge with a width like
27



Jiangxi Bridge will be added when Jiangxi Bridge is repaired on Huadu River. It has
been considered in the design that temporary paths will be set up to let the vehicles
and people pass through. So the bridge construction will have some impact on the
traffic, but very little.
5.1.7.2 Impact of Construction Machinery on the Environment
There are no schools and hospitals with 200m of the bridges to be built, except
Huanggu Junior Middle School atISOm away from K 1+578 a small bridge. Therefore,
the noise of bridge construction will have slight impact on the sensitive points.
5.1.7.3 Impact on the Loss of Soil and Water
The bridge base of Jiangxi Bridge and Xiangan Bridge will be drilled down and
poured with steel concrete. Because the bridge base of the rest will be dug down
widely, the dug-out earthwork may cause loss of soil and water. However, the
dug-open area is small and the loss of soil and water is relevantly small. The rivers
crossed by the highway are all seasoning rivers, and they flow almost dry in winter. If
the work is done in the dry season, the loss will be reduced to lowest degree.
Therefore, the loss of soil and water in bridge construction is slight.
5.1.7.4 Impact on Water Quality in the Rivers
No wastewater will be discharged in bridge construction, so it will have no impact on
the water quality. But in the construction of Jiangxi Bridge and Xiangan Bridge,
necessary measures must be taken to avoid polluting the water quality of the river in
case of the leakage of the concrete.
5.1.8 Traffic Environment and Others
In order to keep the traffic open during the construction, half of the road is under
construction and the two halves in turn which might inevitably cause jam and impact
traffic environment to some degree. However the negative effect is only temporary.
There must be assigned person in charge of monitoring the traffic to ensure the
project's quality and traffic order.
In addition, certain impact would be generated by busy traffic of transportation on the
construction site and would certainly bring inconvenience to the production activities,
travel, living and rest of the residents along the road. But the impact is limited and
could be acceptable.
To sum up, the potential impact during the construction would be impact of traffic
noise and TSP pollutants generated on air environment. As long as necessary
measures are taken, the impact on the environment will be reduced to the lowest
degree. In Chinese tradition, road repair has been considered as a kind of charities, so
nobody would complain about it.
5.2 Operation Period
5.2.1 Impact from Traffic Noise
When this project comes into operation, the traffic condition would be greatly
28



improved after the completion of the project. The forecast of the traffic volume in
S319 (Eriun Road) Wuwei-Huanggu section in Table 2-3 shows that traffic volume
would increase from the average 2013 no./d in the year of 2000 to 9228 no./day in
2025. From this, we can see that the noise impact of traffic would rise as the traffic
volume grows. The major affected areas are Huanggu, Shushan town, Quantang town,
Xiangan town, Taqiao, Shilidun town, Wuwei county and etc. Most houses on both
sides of the highway are used for commerce. Therefore, the people directly affected
by the noise are few.
When China Highway Project conducts EIA, Class I and IV of "Urban Area
Environment Noise Limits" (GB3096-93) are used. The specific limits are shown in
the Table 1-2.
7 primary schools, 4 middle schools and 1 hospital are located within 200m on either
bank of the road. Estimate of environmental sensitive points of traffic noise from
S3 19 (Erjun Road) Wuwei-Huanggu section is presented in the Table 5-6.

Table 5-6 shows that the distance of the schools and hospitals is 30-110 m            away

directly from the road. The estimate demonstrates that the impact of traffic noise on
Jizhong Primary School and Shilidun Central Primary School would exceed the limits
to different degree, and Shilidun Central Primary School is the most serious. It would
exceed by 4.3dB (A) in the daytime and 6.0 dB (A) at night in 2010, and 5.3dB (A)
in the daytime and 8.8 dB (A) at night in 2010. And the rest would meet with the
"Urban Areas Environment Noise Limits" Class I.
5.2.2 Impact on Environment Air
During the operation of the project, the increasing emission of NO2 and CO would
grow on environment air quality along the road corresponding to the rise of traffic
flow by years. Nevertheless, the road is in the plain area with trees on both sides and
good vegetation that is beneficial for air diffusion.
Table 5-7 shows the forecast of the tail gas in S319 (Erjun Road) Wuwei-Huanggu
section based on the designed traffic volume.
Compared with the "Environment Air Quality Limits" (GB3095-1996 ) Class II, the
emission of pollutants NO2 and CO beyond lOm on both sides of the highway can
meet the standards. Therefore, the impact is slight on the environment along the road.
Forecast of the Tail Gas in (Erjun Road) Wuwei-Huanggu Section

After the completion of S319 (Erjun Road) Wuwei-Huanggu section, the traffic
condition of the road would be improved greatly. The TSP produced by vehicles
would decrease correspondingly. The impact of TSP to the sensitive points would
decline as well.
5.2.3 Impact on Hydrology
In the operation period, the impact of the bridge will be on the hydrology of the river.
In accordance with the "Technical Standards for Highway Project" (JTJOOI-97)
stipulated by the Ministry of Communication. The flood frequency of large and
medium bridges is 1/100 and 1/50 for small bridges so as to keep the water flow
through. Because the rivers passed by this highway are all seasoning rivers, the flow
volume is a little larger only in rich period and smaller in other seasons. Therefore, it
is considered in the evaluation that the bridge with the designed standards will not
impact the safety of the bridge and impact the hydrology, either. Table 5-8 shows the
30



hydrological conditions.

Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that impacts caused by highway traffic
noises are major potential environmental impact factors in highway operation.
5.3 Other Environment Problems
On the basis of the features of this "improvement" project and the description of
environment, the evaluation group thinks that the suggested project involves no
intensive improvement activities or sensitive areas, therefore, the impacts on the
following environment problems are tiny or can be neglected:
(1) There is slight impact on wild animals, for there are no species of wild
animals.
(2) There are no natural protection areas, scenic spots, cultural relics and historic
sites along the road.
(3) The project will not fetch or discard the earth, so there are no ecological
problems.
(4) This project involves no land acquisition or resettlement.

Chart 6-1  Environmental management and Monitoring Organization
6.2 Possible Environmental impact Compensation Measures
6.2.1 Design Periodu
6.2. I .1 Store Bulk Materials
In design, the stacking site of the building materials carried from outside and the
material mixing station should be kept as far as possible away from towns, residential
areas, schools and hospitals and when designed. The easily dusting power materials
must be covered.
6.2.1.2 Design the Culverts
The width of the road, when coming across the culverts, matches the width of the
culverts and the frequency 1/50of the flood. Therefore, the length of the culverts
doesn't need adding.
6.2.1.3 Control the Road Dust
In the construction procedure, watering equipment must be designed in order to water
33



the easily-dusting materials and decrease the dust.
6.2.1.4 Select the Site for the Asphalt Mixing Station
Yard mix is designed for the asphalt concrete of the road, and the site for the mixing
station will be selected in accordance with the requirements of EIA. The maintenance
squad in S319 (Erjun Road) Wuwei-Huanggu section is used for the station. There
are few residents and no sensitive points within 100m. The mixer is made in
Quanzhou, Fujiang Province, equipped with dust-protected apparatus. The asphalt
will be melted in an oil tank with a volume of 200t and a hot-oil conducting device.
This kind of closed mixer can effectively stop producing asphalt lampblack and
reduce the flying powder.
6.2.1.5 Greening
In the design of the improvment project, 3m-wide green belt outside the embankment
on both sides of the highway, the slope protection works and side ditches must be
taken into account. The greening works must be designed with the main project.
6.2.1.6 Set Road Signs
110 road signs at crosses have been considered in the design, such as signs of
crosswalks, towns, directions, attention to children, speed limit, local place names and
etc.
6.2.2 Construction Period
The potential environmental impacts in the construction period involved in the traffic
are noise and road dust. The following mitigation measures are suggested:
6.2.2.1 Mixing Concrete
Central yard mix of concrete must be used to decline the impact on air environment
and acoustic environment. In the design, the site for the mixing station and the mixing
equipment of environmental protection are selected. The construction must be in
keeping with the design.
6.2.2.2 Control the Construction Dust
In the construction period, it is necessary to water the easily-dusting sections and
materials in a fixed time, especially in the sections passing through villages and towns.
In dry days, it is necessary to water 4 times a day in order to reduce the dust pollution
to the nearby environment
6.2.2.3 Store Bulk Materials and Prevent Dust
Bulk materials must be stored far away from the sensitive sites of schools, hospitals,
towns and villages. In dry days with strong wind, the easily-dusting bulk materials
must be covered by canvas or plastic cloth to prevent the air pollution in the
construction sections.
6.2.2.4 Treat Wastes
Owing to all the building materials carried from outside, there are few wastes. If any,
34



the action of central disposition in each section will be taken to conserve the water
and soil.
6.2.2.5 Protect Crops
The construction unit has the responsibility to tell the staff and workers to pay
attention to protect the fields and crops along construction sections and not to destroy
the farmland, so as to decrease the damage to the crops.
6.2.2 6 Prevention Measures in Bridge Construction
The major impacts in the bridge construction are on traffic and loss of water and soil,
except for the cement slug in the construction of Jiangxi Bridge and Xiangan Bridge.
Temporary paths are considered in the design in order to reduce the impact on the
traffic. It is suggested in the bridge construction that the surplus earth be used to
strengthen the embankment of the river to reduce the block of river course and loss of
water and soil. Moreover, it would be better to build the bridge in a dry season,
especially for the large and medium bridge, to reduce the loss of water and soil. After
the construction, the construction unit must clear up the reminders in case of blocking
the river, and the slug must be treated and filled.
6.2.2.7 Ensure Traffic Order
The half-side pavement will be used in the rehabilitation project, thus traffic block
will not be avoided. In the construction sections, waming signs or detour signs must
be put to ensure the project quality and keep the traffic in good order. There must be
assigned person in charge of conducting the traffic.
6.2.2.8 Water and Soil Conservation
When working with the fill or excavation, the exposed slopes must be done with
vegetation. Some slopes and side ditches or either end of the culverts must be built up
with bricks or stones, as designed, to stop the water and soil being washed away in the
operation period.
6.2.2.9 Cultural Relic Protection
The on-the-spot investigation and the document provided by Wuwei Cultural Relic
Sector show that there are no cultural relics and historic sites within 200m along the
highway. If any cultural relics are found in the earth, work must be laid aside and the
spot must be protected while reporting to Wuwei Cultural Relics Sector. Only after the
cultural relics are unearthed, the work can go on by the approval of the cultural relic
sector. Before the construction, the contractor must tell the workers that all the
cultural relics and historical sites are state property. Everybody has the responsibility
to protect it and hand in the cultural relics that are found to the local cultural relics
sector. Anyone cannot snatch in an uproar and hide in private.
6.2.2. 10 Road Signs
By the end of the construction, the construction unit must set up the road signs in line
with the design. Most of all, the sign of no whistling must be placed at the distance of
100m in the front of schools and hospitals within 200m on both sides of the highway
35



to reduce the traffic noise.
When the highway goes through villages and towns and there are schools and
hospitals on the sides of the highway, signs of speed limit, village, crosswalk must be
set according to the rules to avoid or reduce traffic accidents.
6.2.2.11 Greening
As the highway goes through the sensitive sections of villages, towns, schools and
hospitals, attentions must be paid to the selection of tree varieties to lessen the
pollution and beautify the environment. The greening works must be finished together
with the main project. About 3500 trees will be cut down when widening the highway,
however, 28461 trees (21024 arbors and 7392 bushes) will be planted after the
rehabilitation.
6.2.2.12 Drainage of Road Surface
The slopes of the subgrade and side ditches will be improved. The easily-washed
slopes will be built with ditches and laid with bricks or planted with vegetation to
protect soil erosion.
6 2.2.13 Environmental Sanitation and Disease Prevention in Campsites
It is essential to pay attention to environmental sanitation and disease prevention. (1)
toilets must be placed; (2) deposit tank must be set up to collect the residential
wastewater; (3) daily garbage must be centralized to fill in spare places; (4) clean
fuels will be used in cooking stoves to decrease the smokes; (5) propaganda column
must be set up to prevent contagious disease and venereal diseases.
During the construction period, the contractor is responsible for the worker's health
check. If anyone is infected with contagious diseases or AIDS, the one must be sent to
hospital at once or be separated for treatment. The contractor must tell the workers the
knowledge of disease prevention and good health habits. Drug taking and whoring are
banned to avoid contagious diseases or AIDS. If found, the one will be expelled and
sent to the public security organs.
6.2.2.14 Set Accusation Signs for Environment Pollution
The construction unit must set up accusation signs for environment pollution in the
sensitive points, with the name of the construction unit, telephone number, the person
in charge and the telephone number for the local EPB to solve the environmental
problems in time if something occurs.
6.2.3 Operation Period
6.2.3.1 Measures to Prevent Traffic Noise
Through the noise forecast in the operation period, the impact of traffic noise on the
environment sensitive points outdoors would meet the requirements of "Urban Areas
Environment Noise Limits" (GB3096-93) Class I.
6.2.3.2 Maintain Greening and Slopes
In the operation period, close attention must be paid to keep 100% of the replanted
36



trees alive. Meanwhile, side ditches and slope protection must be maintained to keep
the ditches through. If the green belt or the slope have any damage, new trees will be
replanted and the slope will be repaired in time. The green belt will be cultivated and
pruned, and the harmful insects will be killed regularly. It is necessary to let the
residents know the importance of road protection.
6.2.3.3 Maintain Road Signs
Various kinds of road signs will be set up by the end of the construction. And the
signs must be immediately changed or replaced if they are damaged or missed in the
operation period.
6.2.3.4 Monitor the tail gas
The highway management sector must cooperate with the local environmental
monitoring station and check the tail gas from the vehicles at a regular time. The
unqualified vehicles are banned to travel in the highway.
6.2.3.5 Manage Environment
The highway squad is directly in charge of maintaining the road surface, the ditches
and slopes as well. Meanwhile the squad is responsible to repair the damaged water
conservation and greening. A management plan will be made out for the responsibility
in each section so as to keep the highway and environmental protection in good order.
6.2.3.6 Monitor Environment
In both construction and operation periods, the environmental monitoring plan in the
EIA must be taken into great accounts, moreover, be implemented in accordance with
the requirements.
6.2.4 Preventive Measures to Environmental Impacts
6.2.4.1 Table 6-2 shows the action plan for the environmental protection. Table 6-3
shows the mitigation measures to the major environmental impacts.

6.5.2 Environmental benefits
The greening works on the sides of the highway can not only change the scenery,
improve the ecological environment and reduce water lose and soil erosion, but also
decrease the road dust pollution owing to the fallen tree leaves. The environmental
monitoring can find out the degree of noise impact on the sensitive sites so as to take
effective mitigation measures if necessary Therefore, the greening works and
environmental monitoring help ecological environment and human health. There are
distinct environmental benefits.

3 It is necessary to educate the "Highway Laws" to raise the realization of taking care
of the highway
The following is the summary of the public opinions:
I. 100%    of the participants support the improvement of S319 (Erjun Road) Wuwei -
Huanggu section. They think improvement of the road is very important to
stimulate local economy, goods circulation, introduce technology and export local
products. Therefore all the people fully support the project.
2. Participants think that construction of road could promote the traffic conditions,
stimulate the economy, and improve the residents living quality. The respective
percentage is 100%, 100% and 51.7%.
3. 34% and 8.6% participants think the impact of the road building is traffic noise
and dust.
4. 100% participants think they care about facilities and trees on both sides.
5. 31%    and 55.2%    participants think traffic jam    and dust would be the focus people
most concern in the construction period. Another 13.8% participants have not
49



expressed any comments.
6. The focus that people most care during the operation period is traffic noise,
polluted air and sidewalks. The corresponding percentage of participants is 69%,
8.6% and 22.0%.
7.1.3 Public Opinion and Suggestions
The investigation shows, although some participants think the construction and
operation of the highway might produce negative effects such as traffic noise, dust
and polluted air on the residents, yet the time of construction is temporary and
acceptable. The improvement of the road shall bring more convenience to the people.
They think the advantage is much larger than disadvantage. As a result the project
obtains 100% support.
Most participants wish the project start the sooner the better so as to let the highway
contribute earlier to society, environment and economy. In addition, it is suggested
that highway administration departments should enforce the highway administration
and maintenance and greening as well for the purpose of keeping the highway in good
condition.
To sum up, 100% participants expressed their positive attitude toward the project,
which plays a good foundation for the project. Highway admimistration departments
and construction units shall frilly concem the public opinions and suggestions and try
their efforts to bring the project into full play.

7.2.1 Contents and Forms of Information Disclosure
During the early stage of environmental assessment of the project, the environmental
assessment group provided information 14 to the public in the activities of public
participation. After the completion of draft ELA, Information 5 was provided to
concerned social organizations. All the information were printed and issued to the
concerned people and representatives of organizations along the highway.
* Information I - Construction Target
The project name: (Erjun Road) Wuwei-Huanggu Section of Highway Maintenance
Component of Anhui Provincial Highway Project of China. The project is the
component of Hefei-Anqing Highway. The first target is to improve transportation
conditions of the poor areas of the provincial west. The second is to promote the
surface quality and traffic capacity to assure the safety of drive. The third is to
increase people's life level and encourage local economy via the rehabilitation.
* Information 2- Project Description
S319 Wuwei-Huanggu section lies in the middle and west of Anhui Province, on the
bank of downstream of Changjiang River. The section starts at Wuwei County, and
ends at Huanggu of Wuwei County, crossing Huanggu, Shushan Town, Quantang
Town, Xiangan Town, Taqiao, Shili Town and the county center. The total length is
49.726km. The sensitive points include 13 units, of which there are 4 middle schools,
7 primary schools and Shushan Center Clinic.
(Erjun Road) Wuwei-Huanggu section traffic volume prognosis (converted to
MTE) : the year 2005, 2845 no./d; the year 2010, 4001 no./d; the year 2020,
7235no./d; the year 2025, 9228 no./d.
The total cost of the rehabilitation of (Erjun Road) Wuwei-Huanggu section is
estimated RMBI 19,759,830 yuan. The project is planned to start in May 2002, and
complete in April 2004, covering the period of 24 months.
* Information 3- potential environmental impact of the project
(1) The noise and dust during the construction shall have negative effects on the
sensitive points along the highway. The construction shall bring inconvenience to the
nearby residents in their daily life. The residential waste and wastewater of the
construction sites shall impact environrment. However the construction shall not
impact the rivers and irrigation system of farming land.
(2) The noise along the highway shall increase as the traffic volume increases once
the highway is in full operation. It is estimated that noise value of daytime and
nighttime of the sensitive points in the year 2010, can meet Class 1 of "Environment
Noise Standard in Urban Areas", except Jizhong Primary School, Shilidun Central
Primary School, and Changba Primary School, of which the top noise exceed the limit.
The top noise value of both daytime and nighttime of Shilidun Primary School is
estimated to reach 59.3dB (A) and 51.0 dB (A) respectively. The three sensitive
points shall decline the value below 50dB (A) and 4OdB(A) by control measures.
52



Therefore it is thought in the assessment that the noise shall impact sensitive points to
some degree, but the impact is limited. On the other hand, the improvement of the
surface will better the traffic condition and reduce dust during the operation period.
* Information 4-Alleviation Plan of Environmental Impact
(I) Designing stage: select proper place for storing building materials and for
mixture, over 200m away from sensitive points: carry out regular maintenance to
noise machines; equip spraying vehicle to control dust; improve greening belts on
both banks; complete road drainage, slope protection and highway facilities like signs
of warning, indication and road direction etc.
(2) construction stage: Building materials for road surface like asphalt brokenstones
shall be centralized for mixture and delivered by vehicle to each construction site.
Strong noise machines shall stop working at night in the places where there are
sensitive points. Spraying shall be done in the places with much dust whenever
needed. The planting of green belts of highway shall be finished at the same time of
the completion of major construction work. The temporary wastewater treatment
facilities shall be established for the treatment of centralized residential wastewater
and waste of construction site.
(3) operation stage: Highway environmental management, environment supervision
institutes and environmental monitoring report system shall be reinforced. Highway
environmental protection targets and environmental management plan shall be
established as well.
* Information 5-Conclusion of environmental impact assessment
The monitoring results of major sensitive points along the highway shows daytime
and nighttime basically meet Class I set out in "Environment Noise Standard in Urban
Area" (GB3096-93), except for the daytime of Shilidun Primary School exceeds the
limit by 1.7dB. The monitoring of air environment shows the daily top value of TSP
and hourly top value of NO2 and CO are both below the limits of Class II set out in
"Environment Air Quality Standard".
The noise of construction and dust in the implementation of the project shall produce
certain effect on the sensitive points nearby, but the effect shall not last long and be
limited. Environmental pollution shall be controlled through various measures on
the construction site and some action shall be taken to prevent from infectious disease
and AIDS through simultaneous propaganda and education.
Although the estimate of traffic noise shows that the traffic noise during the operation
period shall produce certain impact on the three sensitive points, the noise value shall
decline to reach the limit of Class I set out in "Environment Noise Standard in Urban
Area" through control measures. The estimation in terms of tail air of vehicle shows
that CO and NO2 shall be lower than Class 2 of "Environment Air Quality Standard".
The tail air generated shall be limited when the alleviation measures are put into
practice and green belts on both banks of the highway are built.

For the sake of further collection of comments from the public, the environmental
assessment group sent the printed draft Environmental Assessment Report, results of
public participation and social organization consultation to the cultural activity center
or displayed in the libraries of Wuwei County and towns. The display lasted one

8. Conclusion
The proposed "improvement" project of (Erjun Road) Wuwei-Huanggu section is
one of the highway maintenance component of Anhui province proposed to apply for
the World Bank loan. The total length is 52km. This subproject is also one of the
highway improvement projects in the 1Oth five-year plan. This is the action to promote
transportation condition of Huai plain and lay better foundation for local economic
development and flow of goods and people.
The civil works of the project shall implement within the range of existing future
subgrade, thus there is no requirement for land acquisition or demolition or
resettlement. According to the investigation and consultation with Wuwei Cultural
Relics Administration Sector and Wuwei County Forestry Bureau, there are not any
objects requiring special protection along the highway such as cultural relics, historic
sites, tourist landscapes, wild animals and plants.
The project implementation has sound social basis and natural environment. The
monitoring results of major sensitive points along the highway shows noise of
daytime and nighttime basically meet Class I set out in "Environment Noise
Standard in Urban Area" (GB3096-93 ) . The monitoring of air environment shows
the daily concentration value of TSP and hourly concentration value of NO2 and CO
are both below the limit of Class II set out in "Environment Air Quality Standard".
The other ecological environment and social environment shall not produce
constraining impact.
During the implementation, noise and dust generated by the construction shall
produce certain effect on the sensitive points along the highway, but the impact is
temporary and limited to the acceptable level. The traffic noise and vehicle tail air
caused by the increase of traffic volume shall not much impact sensitive points along
the way. However during the operation period, environmental management,
supervision system reporting procedure of monitoring should be strengthened so as to
alleviate environmental impact to the lowest degree.
To sum up, this project would produce certain negative effects on the resident's life,
school's study and hospital's wards. However as long as the mitigation measures
proposed in EIA are actually taken, the unfavorable effects will be effectively
controlled and decreased to the lowest degree. Through the comprehensive
assessment, the social benefits and economical benefits are considerable. 100% of the
people along the highway support the project. Therefore this project is feasible in
conclusion.
The project is located in the poverty stricken area at the state level. Per capita GDP
there accounts for 74% of the per capita GDP of the province. Less developed
transportation constrains the growth of local economy. The improvement of the
highway shall create more opportunities for local farmers to enter the market and
participate in the competition. More agriculture products and side products shall
appear in the market and more technical and scientific information shall spread in the
55



towns and villages. The construction of the project shall bring typical social benefits
and economic benefits. Investigation and public participation show 100% of
participants support the project, which means the project is so important to the local
economic development.
