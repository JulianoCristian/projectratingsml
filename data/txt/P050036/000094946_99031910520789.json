The\n            main components of the project are: 1) the construction of\n            the expressway connecting Hefei and Anqing; 2) the\n            improvement and rehabilitation of existing highways; 3) the\n            implementation of a highway safety program; 4) institutional\n            building program & training; 5) the imposition of\n            front-end fees through tolls on users of the Hefei-Anqing\n            Expressway; and 6) land acquisition and resettlement\n            program. The Anhui Provincial Communications Department\n            (APCD) has the overall responsibility for project\n            preparation and implementation. The Anhui Highway\n            Administration Bureau (AHAB) is responsible for the\n            implementation of the highway maintenance program as well as\n            the highway safety program. The overall direction of the\n            project at the central level will rest with the Ministry of\n            Communications (MOC), assuming also a coordinating role and\n            provide technical support."}, "docdt": "1998-10-30T00:00:00Z"}
