    Gaohebu to Anqing. During construction, dust will be\n            controlled by placing earth and bitumen mixing plants at the\n            lower wind and way from the residential areas, hospitals,\n            schools, etc. Vehicles transporting construction materials\n            should be covered. Water should be sprinkled on the roads\n            and construction sites. To mitigate the impact of noise\n            pollution, construction machines should be properly\n            maintained. To reduce soil erosion, low hills with\n            relatively poor vegetation should be chosen first for the\n            borrowing sites. After the borrowing, the ground should be\n            cleared up duly and vegetation restored. Water quality will\n            be monitored regularly. During the operation period, impact\n            of noise will be controlled by forbidding vehicles producing\n            standard-surpassing noise on the highway and installing\n            acoustic barriers. Environmental monitoring system is to be\n            carried regularly to monitor the level of nitrogen oxide\n            (NOx). The use of lead-free gas should be encouraged to\n            reduce air pollution. Exposed transport of coal, cement, or\n            roughly packed chemical fertilizer should be forbidden on\n            the road."}, "docdt": "2002-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
