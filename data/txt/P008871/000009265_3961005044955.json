using industries in Turkey to effectively\n            and efficiently phase out ODS usage through the adoption of\n            policy, technological and monitoring measures.  The project\n            has three main components.  The first component consists of\n            investment projects technology transfer for ODS Phase Out\n            and includes: a) introduction of ODS-free technologies in\n            the production of domestic refrigerators including\n            compressor engineering, production retrofit and phaseout in\n            rigid foam; b) recovery and recycling of refrigerants in the\n            Instanbul area; and c) recovery and recycling of\n            refrigerants at refrigerator production facility.  The\n            second component consists of preparatory activities,\n            including demonstration projects, for preparation of further\n            ODS phaseout projects.  The third component deals with\n            institutional and organizational issues and it includes: a)\n            setting up of the ozone panel; b) establishment of the\n            monitoring system for the consumption of ODSs; c) a program\n            for awareness of ozone issues by the public and industry;\n            and d) a framework for regulation of the use of ODSs in the future."}, "docdt": "1993-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
