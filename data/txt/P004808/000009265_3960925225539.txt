Attacbied is the Project Comnpletion Reports on Wester Samoa, Tonga Development Bank and Fiji
Developm  Bank (Credits 1582-WSO, 1813-TON andln 2598-PU) pt   ed by East Aa and Pafic
Regional Offie, with Part  coibuted by the Borrowers.
ITb  three projects were all crded out witin the World Ban/Asian Development Bank
cofinmncing agement  The Asian Deveopment Bank had the lead responsibility for supervising the
projects and preparing the PCRs. The Bank added an *Evaluation Summary* which reflect the sandard
format of Bankes PCRs.
Mie objecdves of te tree projects were broadly similar, i.e., trnsr capital and tec al
esitnce for agricultue and agro-based indusries, strengthen the mnp ment of the respctive
development ntudons and attin an intre  rate sructure consstet with financi  sustainability
reuiementa,y
The outcome of the FII operadon Is rated as unasfatory, Its sustanblty as uMky and the
inttuoa Impact as negligible. FPji obtained loans at sigificantly ow   ost from the Eurpean
InvesmentBank. Furthrmore, the finnca sytm In FIJi had bcme relatvely iquid tu enabling
FDB to borrow at lower costs. As a resut, Fiji decided to canc   e undisbursed balance of US$5.3
millio out of the origil total of US$6.5 milon. As the PCR recogizes, a trough assessment by the
Bank ofFDB's likely ace to cosona  findings would have led to a reas       of£tejudficadon
Of the oan.
The outcome of the two credits in Tonga and Wesn Samoa is rated as sats6ctory, musanability
as uncertan and instidtonal Impact as pardal. With respect to the Tonga project, while the taf of
foreig exchap resources for Investment was successuy implemented meeting bot comtmet and
disbu   et scleduls, the sustainability of th project, as nicad In te PCR, remains depende  on
TDB's abUity to develop no a selfsustaining and viable financia Insdtudon. Ibis I turn inges on
TDis's capacity to develop a lending rate strucue allowing for fi!l recovery of coss and adequate profit
margins. TDB has made prog   In strengtening Its mangme  staffing and organizadonl sm e.
A follow-W project has addtessed a number of TDB's outst      deficiencies.
As to the Westem Samoa Development Bank (DBWS) opeation, the peforman  of the project,
with 90 out of the 117 larger projec  subproects opeatilg sadsfatorily and conidern  th adverse
Impact of the 1990 and 1991 cyclones on some subprojects, can be conidered acceptable. Hwever, as

PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Development Bank of West  Samoa
Project, for which Credit 1582-WSO in the amount of SDR 2.1 million (at the time equivalent to
US$2.0 mllion) was approved on April 28, 1985. The project was cofinanced by the Asian
Development Baink (ADB). The credit was closed on September 30, 1990, in accordance with the
orgin  schedule. The final disbursemeat was made on November 16, 1990 and the undisbursed
blce of SDR 254,906 canceled. With the increase in the value of the SDR relative to the US

Development Bank (the project's principal financier), ADB was responsible for the overall project
fmuation and appraisal, and for subsequent supervision of lmplementation. The ADB Loan for the
Project closed on June 21, 1991, two years later than plamned. The ADB PCR was issued in
December 1992, following a project completion mission in March 1992. The PCR is accompanied by

fourth IDA Credit approved for Westem Samoa, following three earlier credt which bad suppoted
agricultr and upgradig te basic road infrastructure. The project was the second in a series of  mur
davdelot bank projects, cofinanced wihi the Asian Development Bank (ADB), In Pacfic slad
Countries.. The Associatko lending strategy for Weste  Sama was focused on increasing the
productive bas of the economy through diversifying agdcult, raising productiviy, strengthe
key economic institutions, and, in th longer term, prmoting the developmnt of viable agobaed
Industries. Overal perfrmance of the agricultur sector-which accound for 60 percent of (DP,
had bee mied; the industrl secor, accounting for 20 percent of GDP, suffered from the
constaits of a limited rource base, small domestic market, remoten   from world maret and
low labo skills; and the fincial system was still evolving and mmtg. ADD had a well-
established elaonship wh the Development Bank, and the project was ADB's fifth opeaton to
sUport DBWS. DBWS, etablised by the Govment In 1974, srved 80 pcent of vies and
30 perce  of houeholds. ts agricultural lending and procesing w  generaUy wek, nd alWugh
empwered to do so, It did not accept deposits nor make working capital loans. With a gross marg
n lons of about 5 percent, operons had bee only marginaly profitalo. At the tim  of appraisal,
th loans ares situation had deteriorated, and 56 percent of loans in the repayment stae wer
affected. The collectio ratio had declined to 50 percent in 1983.

of the project completion report. However, a "specIal IDA implsion aetion was tt IDA

staff were expected to participate as necessary with ADB in supervision missions. Ihis IDA
evaluativn summary recalls the project objectives as presented in the I)DA President's Report to the
Board, summarizes key findings of the ADB  project completion repor and offers an IDA perspective
on some of the findings.
2.    Objectives and Descriptlon
2.1         The project was designed to promote investment in smallholder agriculture and agro-
based industries, improve the Government's industrial policy framework and strengthen the
management of the key development lending institution. Furthermore, the project was seen as
providing the opporunity for timely IDA operational involvement in Western Samoa and further
dialogue with the Govermment on important policy and institutional issues. Tbe project would finance
the foreign exchange costs of relatively small development projects primarily in the industry and
agriculture sectors, strengthen DBWS through technical assistance, and improve the policy
environment for industrial investment through an industrial sector survey.
2.2         The ADB appraisal report noted that the four previous ADB loans had resulted in
substantial economic benefits, and considered that project risks were minimal-the only possible ridsk
being if the DBWS arrears position were to deteriorate. However, arrears had stabilized and a
comprehensive arrears reduction plan was being put together. The IDA President's Repot idenified
two major risks, one the arrears problem, which was being addressed, and second, a risk of negative
iterest rates if inflation were to flare up in 1985-86, leading to possible misuse of fiuids borrowed.
3.    Inplementation  xperience
3.1         Subprojects. 2.963 s1 loans were financed, with the distribution of externa finc
being 30 percent to agriculture and fishing, 18 percent each to transport, tourist acco on, and
mnufiecturing, 5 percent to village education, and 11 percent to other services. The larger
subprojects (those receiving ADB/IDA financing of US$15,000 or more) accounted for 70 percent of
the total ADBIDA financing. Of these 117 larger subprojects, 107 were located on Upolu, most
near Apia, the capital, with only 10 on the less developed island, Savai'i. The remaining funds wme
provided to 2,846 smaller subprojects, mainly in the agriculture sector, a much higher nmber than
expected at appraisal, when only 1,100 subloans were expected in total. Tbe average ADB/IDA
financing of these smaller subprojects was WST 1,100 (US$500) and, given the low interest margin
on small agriculture loans, these transactions would have resulted in a significant operadtg loss to
DBWS.
3.2         Technical Assistance. A six person-months Industrla sector swey was prepared, but
no changes ensued in Western Samoa's industrial investment environment. Nine person-months of
consultant services to establish a coherent project promodon program within DBWS was also
unsuccessfil in effecdng any discernible change In practices. A six person-months undettaig on
accounting and management Wormaon systems produced an accounting manua and
recommendations for computerizaion, but DBWS management decided not to adopt the computer



recommendatIons. 1/ Only the fourth technical assistance component, six person-monts to Improve
strategies and procedures relating to lending to the agriculture sector, was considered by the ADB
PCR mission to have been successful, and indeed to have markedly improved the efficiency of
DBWS's agricultur operadons. However, eforts under this componen to promote credit unions
failed, despite support from DBWS management.
3.3          DBWS. DBWS Inerest rates were increased to 10 percent for agriculture loans and to
16 percent for industrial and service sector loans in March 1985, fulfilling an effectiveness condition
of the ADB Loan. However in October 1986, following consultations with ADB, DBWS reduced
Intefest ras by 2 percentage points. And following Cyclone Oft In February 1990, the Government
Imposed a ceiing of 12 percent on all Interest rates. A DBWS rehabilitation study in 1991, financed
by ADD, recommended interest rates be increased to a minimum of 13 percent, but this was not
accepted. However the rate on some agriculture loans was increased to 10 percent and on some other
loans to 13 or 14 percent 2/
3.4          Dudng project implementation, the composition of the DBWS Board changed
significantly three times-in 1985, 1987, and 1990. ADB pointed out to the Government In 1990 that
DBWS directors had received subloans, in breach of a covent    is problem extended to loans to
entaprlses inwhich directors had an interesL The ADB PCR also notes tat for a period some
directors were over-involved in day-to-day management. Indeed, the DBWS board revered
management dedsions, based on sound analysis, to decline some loan. Ike Government took
corrective action, and the problem no longer exists. XI
4.    Results
4.1          Subprojects. ITe ADB PCR repot tht ninety of the 117 larger subprojects are
operting satiaoly and do not have any hard-core aars with DBWS; 22 hav enconred
significant difficulties and are not properly servicing their loans, and five subprojects have failed.
The sparse data availale Indicates projects geneated WST 2.7 mlion of value added. However,
only 17 prcent of the larger subloans are reported as finncing nw subprojects, and the ete  to
which the remaining 83 pert Iduced iemena economic befits to the economy is not clear.
The faied and in-difficulty subprojects account for 24 percent of the larger subloam by value.
Cyclones Ofa and Val in 1990 and 1991 were major contributg factors to the faiure or difficulties
of some subprojects, together with Board directives to finance subprojects no rcommeded by
management. Data on performance of the 2,846 small subprojects is not available, and it is not clear

whether poor subloan recovery rates reflect poor subproject performance or poor credit collection
performane by DBWS.
4.2          DBWS. Under the project, DBWS agreed to implement a plan to reduce arrears to a
maximum of 10 percent of loans by December 31, 198S. However arrears have remained close to
20 percent !I/ lhe annual collection ratio (that Is, collections as a proportion of amouns due In a
year) increed from 42 percent In 1985 to 50 percent in 1986, but then fell to 43 percent, but has
since Increased to 57 percent in 1991. The ADB PCR notes that reasons for poor coUection include a
degree of politicization of the Board, and *poor credit discipline that may reflect cultura factors".1S
Western Samoa retains its tradidonal culture, with strong obligations of support between individuals
and wihin vilage commuaties. Corporate entities are not part of the traditional culture.
4.3          With debt write-offs and unprofitable agriculture loans, DBWS has recorded a net
operating loss before tax in five of the eight years to 1991, including 1989, 1990, and 1991. Over
the six years 198S-91, DBWS operating losses totaled WST 4.1 million (JS$1.8 million) due to
provisions for doubtfid debts totaling WST 13.7 million (US$6.1 million) over the period. fi/
DBWS Is able to service the loans it has received, as they have long grace periods, but the ADB PCR
expresses conern about liquidity in future years, stressing the importance of achieving significany
imprved profitability and loan collections. The ADB PCR also notes that the covenat requiring
annual reviews of interest rates, and consultation with ADB before changing the rate strucue, had
been largely disregaded, and the prmary itention of the covenants ihat DBWS manain interest
rates that would allow for profltable operation, was not satisfied.
S.    IDA, ADB and Borrower Relationships and terformance
5.1          IDA, ADB, and the Borrower initally had different pepectives on the problems of
DBWS and the Government's policies towards the Bank. IDA's only mission was in mid-1988, in
respnse to mounting concerns about DBWS's performance. IDA subseqnty ranked the project as
a problem project. DBWS was seen as having unaisbfactory fiancial condition, poor porfl
quality, high arrears and low collection rates. Systemic problems were descibed as: 0) a lack of
appropria  action on the part of DBWS and the Glovernment to develop DBWS as a comameally
viable financidal insution, () a lack of apprpriate DBWS accounting and operating policies; and
(ii) a lack of adequate ADB/IDA supervion in identing and following-up appropriate
corrective/remedial actions. ADB's South Pacific Regional Office had expressed concem that the
stanrds of perfomance applied to DBWS by MDA's mission were of a caliber which may be very
difficult to achieve among Pacific island development finace insutions and ADB's headqut  had

noted that "DBWS, like other South Pacific development finance institutions, is generally working in
extremely difficult economic environents ..... and that there are no quick-fixes for a remedy." IDA
subsequently refused to enend the Closing Date of its Credit (September 1990), and canceled the
undisbursed balance. ADB, in concurring with IDA's assessment of DBWS's problems provided
Technical Assistance to encourage a drastic change in the operation of the Bank. Wbile ADB
extended its loan closing date to June 1991, It did not support a request for a sixth Project.
5.2          A DBWS position paper in 1990 noted that DBWS had to take risks which no other
financial institution would take "where we sometimes have to make loans not necessarily because they
are viable according to the set norms and rules of banking, but where social and other criteria are
considered as more important, and where fimding from inational financing institutions comes
tagged with provisions to lend to certain sectors of the economy and the intenational fincing
instittions themselves do not make provision for the risks Involved in lending to such sectors. With
the above as generally our bag of goods, it is regrettable to note that traditional criteria like
profitability, debt servicing capability, collections and arrears as a percentage of loan portfolio
continue to be used to judge the viability of a Development Bank." 2/
6.    Project SustainablUty
6.1         Over half of the subloans by value are rated as satictory, and prima faWe represent
finnmially sustinable subprojects. However, the June 1988 IDA review mission expressed concern
about the amount of rescheduling which had taken place to upgrade poorly performing accounts to
saisfactory status. By the end of the project, Westm Samoa, with its small population of 165,000,
had borrowed from ADBJIDA se proportionately massive total of US$19.2 million for DBWS in five
loami.; nd DBWS ha- bee acc._red USS$3.0 mi11Ion of tdhncalass1st--  te Dvelopment Bank,
which is obligated to repay the on-lent ADB/IIDA funds to the Govenment, appears not to be
susWanable unless its collection performance substantially inproves, and unless it establishes adequate
interest rate spreads for vario  classes of business, and in particuar markedly increased spreads for
small agricultre loans.
7.    Conclusions and Lesons Learned
7.1         The project met It goal to promote investment in smailholder agriculture and agro-
based industries, but failed to improve the Government's industrial policy framework, stre n the
manaement of the key development lending institution, and further the dialogue with the Government
on important policy and instiutional issues. DBWS is not sustainable without a radical change of
policy by Governmt.
7.2         The main findings and lessons derived in this IDA evaluation summary are threefold:
(a)   DBWSperfomam:. goals have not been adequately alcldated In a caoh
ludtulonal development plan acceptable to the Samoan polical community as a
whol.

The failure of DBWS to emerge as a viable Intitution is In accordance wlth the world-
wide experience of development finance projects. Lessons relevant to the Western
Samoan include the need for adequate opeting margins and the desirability of market
interest rates to encourage the most economically viable projects, and mobilize
domestic savings; and the benefit of social objectives being pursued through explicit
Government subsidies, rather th  thrugh unsound credit. At the small saver and
borrower level, Western Samoa might consider whether 'grassroots' revolving savings
and credit associations popular In many countries, might be atrctive to Samoan
culture, as well as the experience of the Gameen Bank in Bangladesh, and the village
unit banking system of Bank Rakyat lodonesia, both of which have been designed to
respond to village level constraints and demand.
(b)   IDA's roe was not adequately anlyzed at the ouset of the prject, and resources
were not allocated to achi  the stated goals ofparticipation In sperison missions,
and dialogue with  e Govnent on Important policy and   tuonal issues.
With the Bank's increased country focus in recent years, and the support of the
Austian International Development Assistance Buieau, the macro-economic dWogue
in general has been resourced and implemented. In contast, the stats of IlDA's
supervision and subsector dialogue Is Indicated by the less ta one staff-week per year
used to review progress of the project. OED, in a study of the World Bank
involvement in Pacific island countries (Report No. 10693, May 1992) concluded that
the Bank can potently play an importaent role in helping the Pacific Island Cowtries
to prepare and Implement appropriat development strategies; tht the 1980s
cooperative arrangement with ADB is no longer relevant; and that the Bank will need
to allocate dedicated staff resorces to an expanded program. As the Bank defines its
fuiure strategies, the experience of this project indicates that goals and resources must
be more carefully matched tham in the past
(c)   Deelopment impa. recogning te cltura seing, and not merey  hutonal
devlpment, should be te mainfactor when considering any possile,fitwe IDA
actlvly nwilvng DBWS.
With Western Samoaes growth poteal lyng pripally in te tourism, smal and
medium-scale industria, and agiulturla sectors, an imont focus of any future IDA
efforts should be to assist the country develop a suitable economic environment for
private sector-led economic activity in all sectors to flourish. Ihe availability of term
finance will support such actvity. However, if the expertise built up in DBWS is to
be mobilized, the broad-based political acceptance of a coherent DBWS oprating
mandate mentioned above wil be necesary.

The following are D8WS coents On the above Report. The comments are made where
necessary in the order of issues raised In tho Evaluation Susmary of the Report.
IHPLHETATIoll EXEINCEC
6.    Technical Assistance
DBWS generally agrees with the results of the TAL under the above project.
There have however been some significant improvements in the areas looked into
by the above TA since then. There has been a strong shift in the government
ecouomic strategies in the past couple of years, towards promoting/encouraging
foreign investment in the country. This has called for strengthening project
investment promotion within the newly created Ministry of Trade, Commerce and
Industry formerly the Department of Economic Development.
This project promotion is now appropriately carried out on a national basis
by the relevant Government Ministry, an objective which was promoted by the TA
on project promotion.
While DBWS did consider dropping the Th recommended computerization program
because of the high costs, the Bank has since developed and used an appropriate
computer program using PCs, for its accounting and management infoumation.
Further improvements on this project are being implemented to enhance the Banks
information system.
7.   DBWS
The current DBWS interest rates are 8S to 13S for agriculture projects, and
121 to 142 for manufacturing, tourist and transport services projects. The above
rates were effective from January 1992. While there are no immediate plans to
review these rates, Management intends to discuss a review with the Board before
the end of this financial year.
8.    The current Board of Directors was appointed In mid 1991 and includes only
two from the last Board. Management to quite satisfied with the decision making
and genral support of tbh current Board. Management does not envisage any
difficulties in its working relationship with this Board.
REBULTS
9.   Rosults
The devastations caused by the two cyclones in 1990 and 1991 were the major
contributing factors to the failure and difficulties of many of the sub-projects.
This has been reflected on the decline in the annual collection ratio to 512 In



-2
Attachment 1
Page 2 of 3
1992.
10.  Arrears has been a *erious problem with DBWS in the past years. DBWS is
currontly implementing another arrears reduction plan to reduc- arrears by 10l
this current financial year. Presently, the level of arrears is at 141 of total
portfolio in repayment stage. The above arrear6 plan will now be the basis for
aseessing staff performance and salary reviewe at the end of the assessment
period.
The annual collection ratio declined to 51 in 1992 mainly due to the
ditficulties faced by many sub-projects following Cyclone Val, rather than
"politicization of the Board" as claimed in the PCR. The export of local produce
(e.g. taro) was suspended for most of 1992 by order of Government to retain
enough food for the country after the cyclone devastations.
This affected the Income of many farmers and hence servicing of their
loans.
11. While DBWS did record losses in the past 5 years to 1991, its financial
performance in 1992 was a great improvement, recording a profit before tax of
$736,966.   This achievement was possible through the general reduction in
operational costs, the significant of which were the provision for doubtful debts
(by 57Z compared to 1991), and cost of borrowings (reduction of 91). It is
expected this trend will be maintained if not improved upon this finanzial year.
IDs ADB, BOD RE URLATIONSHIP AND PEORMANCE
12.  While DBWs is still trying to resolve some of its traditional problems as
noted in the report, It is now doing this with a degree of confidence, compared
to the previous years. This is attributed to
(i)   a more supportive and dedicated Board towards the objective of improving
the financial performance and quality of the loan portfolio of the Bank
(ii) a new Management team with a more serious and realistic approach towards
improving loan collections, linked to staff performance
(iiI) a more improved accounting and computer system, which has allowed more up
to date information on loans arrears collectives and general business operation
(iv) the expressed directive by the Covernment that the DBWS Board will now be
fully accountable to the financial performance of the Bank
(v)   the establishment of a Bank business plAn for the period 1992 to 1995,
which among other things, has allowed greater delegation of authority to the
Management In operational matters within the Bank.
DBWS endorses ADB's assessment of the general difficulties faced by small
DPT like DBWS and that the "quick fix remedy" approach of IDA does not help the
efforts of DBWS to improve its financial performance.

13.   VIWS certainly takes a lot of risks in its lending activities. Tbhre are
project. with very high social and human valu, attached to the., which DIM1
considers worth asistin  because they contribute to the advancement of soeal
and conomic liveo of other people. These inlud, school buildings, wator supply
and si*ilar projects, which are iaplemented on a c¢ommal bais by villae*.
While these projects are not commerci    project., they are neverthele assessed
on their ability to generate funds (usually from the village other devslopment
projects and fund raising activities) to repay the DBW8 loan. Theso social and
human valued projects are only financed by the Bsnk when it is established that
the required loan can be serviced.

14.  It ws inevitable following the Cyclone,  n 1990 and 1991, that the DBM8
had to provide some form of rehabilitation to allow damaged projects to be re-
establisbhd. Because the cash flow of most projects were affected and honce
their abilitie to repay, the Bank considered appropriate to re-schedule these
loan repaymeuts for realistic periods, to allow adequate recovery te. Where
a rescheduling would only postpone the problems, tho DMB8 would proceod with
foreclosure.
CONCLUSIONS AND LUSSONS LERNED
DAWS Management generally supports th recommendations of the Report on the
lessons derived from the IDA Credit. DBMS agrees with the desirability to apply
market interest rates in its landing. Wo wil raise this issue with the local
authoritios before the end of this financial year. Other lesson, will certainly
be explored by the Blak and may be acted upon if viable.

Thank you for your fax message of March 16, 1993 and the attached draft Project Completion
Report for the Developmnt Bank of Western Samoa Project (Credit No. 1582-WSO). We have
reviewed the draft report and have found it gmnerafly acceptable and in accordance with tie
views expressed in our PCR for Loan No. 770-SAM.
We would however prefer to see a more curmrt verion of ADB's perpective on DBWS's
problems redected ia the report. In particula, para 12 of the document epresses the view ta
IDA and ADB 'hadad hb different perspecAves.'.'. We feel that the situation as outlined
in our PCR whereby a 1990 Review Mision fom this office strongly supporctd what was in
ffect IDA's position on DBWS should be more fully reflected. Purthermore, as a rsult of the
Mission's anysis and the position that Mion took, further Technical Asstce was
provided to DBWS. As a result of this TA and of subsequent poicy dialogue with the
Government, we consder that we have alady encouragd a radical changC in the
Government's policies toward DBWS. This posdtion is oudined in some detal in our PCR, a
draft copy of which was provided to you lt December.

1.. DACRGRotThI
A.   Brief History
1. -The Development Bank of Western Samoa  (DBWS) was
established under the Development Bank Act of 1974 following the
provision of Bank technical assistancel/ to the Development
Department of the Bank of Western Samoa.   OBWS's authorized
capital was initially fixed at WSS5.0 million and this was
increased to WS510.0 million in January 1985.  The Government
holds all of DBWS's shares. The Government has assisted DBWS in
various ways including granting an initial ten-year tax
exemption, guaranteeing foreign borrowing and provision of local
currency resources. The Government appoints DBWS's Board of
Director with the Financial Secretary to the Government
currently appointed as Chairman.
2.        The  Statement  of Operating  and  General  Business
Policies adopted by DBWS (see Appendix One) provides for
operations that are generally in line with the economic
development objectives and priorities of the Government. Within
this framework, DBWS enjoys a reasonable degree of autonomy in
its day-to-day activities.
3.        The  Bank  has  paid  a  crucial  role  in  DBWS's
establishment and ongoing development. Six technical assistance
grants for a total amount of $950,000 and five loans for a total
amount of $16 million have been provided to date.
B.   Scone of Operations
4.        The Development Bank Act and DSWS's Statement of
General Business Policies provide for DBWS's operation as a
multipurpose Institution able to assist most sectors of the
economy through lending, equity investment and guarantee
operations. Most of OBWS's operations however have been
restricted to provision of medium term loans.
C.   Relationship with the Bank and Other Lenders
5.        Since DDWS was established in 1974,  the Bank has
provided DBWS five loans out of ADS resources totalling $16.0
million. The Bank has also provided six technical assistance
grants for a total of $915,000, primarily for the institutional
development and rehabilitation of DBWS. All of the Bank's loans
so DBWS were made to the Government, with maturities ot- 40
years, including a grace period of ten years at an interest rate
(service charge) of 1 per cent per annum. These loans were re-
lent by the Government to DBWS at an interest rate of 6 per cent
per annum for a term of 15 years including a grace period of
eight years (except the first loan for which the grace period
was three years).
XI   TA No. 80-SAM for $217,000, approved in January 1973



- 12 -
6.        In February 1990, the Government requested a sixth
line of credit for DBWS from the Bank. However, a Review Mission
fielded from the Bank's South Pacific Regional office (SPRO) in
March 1990 found that, in terms of portfolio condition and
financial performance, pBWS would not meet the Bank's  criteria
for a repeat line of credit.  Furthermore, some key covenants
under Loan No. 707-SAM had been breached, particularly covenants
that had been introduced to ensure that DBWS operated with
appropriate managerial autonomy and under reasonable commercial
discipline (see paras 58 to 60).
7.        To address this situation, the Government request
further technical assistance from the Ban.c for the preparation
of Operational Strategies and a Corporate Plan that would
provide a format for DBWS's rehabilitation as a stronger and
more effective Institution. This technical assistance was
provided during the first quaarter of 1991 (TA No. 1399-SAM).
Based on implementation of the findings and recommendations from
that TA, DBWS has gradually improved its operational performance
to a degree that there appear to be reasonable prospects for the
Bank's criteria being met for processing of a further line of
credit during. 1993.
8.        In addition to Bank assistance, DBWS has obtained
through the Government a credit line of ECUs89O,000 ($1.2
million equivalent) from the European Investment Bank (EIB), a
loan from the Australian International Development Assistance
Bureau (ADAB) for WS$260,O00 equivalent and a credit from the
International Development Agency (IDA) for SDR 1.2 million ($2-0
million;equivalent).   The IDA credit co-financed the Bank's
fifth loan to DBWS.
9.        With regard to its local currency resources,  DBWS
continues to receive equity injections as required from the
Government. DBWS also has access to medium-term funds from
National Provident Fund and to overdraft facilities from the two
commercial banks in Western Samoa.
D.   Rationale for the Bank Loan
10.       The Bank's fifth loan to DBWS of $4.0 million was
intended as a general credit line which would be used as
additional resources to DBWS to support implementation of the
Government's Fifth Five-Year Development Plan (1985-1989). In
utilizing the credit line, DBWS would provide medium and long-
term loans to support private sector investment in the
agriculture, industrial, tourism and key service sectors. The
loan proceeds were to be utilised to finance foreign exchange
expenditures. The Government bore the foreign exchange risk on
the Loan.
11.       Technical assistance provided as part of the Project
had the particular objectives of reviewing the prospects for
growth  within  the  industrial  sector,  upgrading  DBWS's
capabilities in project promotion and agricultural lending and



-13 -
to enhance DBWS's accounting and management information systems.
The rationale for providino this assistance was that DBWS had
exhibited some weaknesses in those aspects of its operations and
strengthening was required t o ensure the ongoing health of the
Institution as well as to protect the manner in which the loan
proceeds were utilized.
12.       The Bank Loan was co-financed ty IDA in an amount of
$2.0 million with the IDA Credit utilized on a 67;33 pro-ratio
disbursement basis for sub.-oans financed under the project.
UNDP contributed $50,000 toward the cost of the technical
assistance with the UNOP portion being utilized for an
industrial  sector survey cf Western Samoa.   The principal
objective of this survey was to identify project opportunities
which DBWS could promote.
13.       The Appraisal Mission estimated that sub-projects
financed under the Loan would result in the cr',ation of about
1,000 job opportunities and would earn or save foreign exchange
of about  $2.5  million per  annum.    The  expected  sectoral
distribution  of  the  Loan  proceeds  was  40  per  cent  to
agriculture, 40 per cent to industries, 10 per cent to services
and 10 per cent to the transport sector.
II. IMPLEMENTATION
A.   Lending Policies
a
14.       DBWS's lending policies are governed by its Policy
Statement (see Appendix 1), formulated in 1974 in consultation
with the Bank. This st%tement has remained substantially
unchanged and continues to provide appropriate guidance to DBWS
in its operations. The Statement provides for the prudential
management of DBWS's financial assets through diversification of
portfolio and imposition of ceilings on DBWS's exposure to
individual enterprises. "'he Statement also specifies that DBWS
will not assume any exchange risk on foreign exchange related
transactions and borrowings, that it will maintain a maximum 3:1
debt/equity ratio and that it will establish a reserve for bad
and doubtful debts equal to 10 per cent of total portfolio
value. While the statement requires DBWS to assist primarily
private sector investment in line with the Government's economic
development policies, lending to public sector enterprises is
not precluded.
15.       At the time of loan appraisal, DBWS's lending interest
rates were 8 per cent for agriculture loans and 14 per cent for
loans to the industrial and service sectors. These rates were
between four and 6 per cent lower than those charged by the
commercial banks in Western Samoa at the time and had been
reduced at thle Government's behest in August 1983 by around two
per cent from previous levels. Appendix 2 provides details of
Western Samoa's interest rates during the period 1985 to 1991.
Government had required DBWS at the time to lower interest rates



- 14-
to  provide  an  additional  incentive  for  private-sector
investment, particularly in the agriculture sector.  however,
the appraisal mission for Loan No. 707-SAM found that the
resultant interest rate structure would have a strongly
detrimental effect on DBWS's profitability.   Accordingly, a
condition of loan effectiveness required that DBWS's interest
rates be increased to 10 per cent for agriculture loans and to
16 per cent for industrial and service sector loans.   This
condition was fulfilled during March 1985. However in October
1986, following Government's action to encourage a general
lowering of interest rates and following consultations with the
Bank, DBWS reduced interest rates by 2 per cent.  Following
Cyclone Ofa in February 1990, the Government imposed a ceiling
of 12 per cent on all interest rates including DBWS's, again
reducing the maximum DBWS could charge on industrial and service
sector loans.
16.       A  key  recommendation  from TA  1399-SAM  was  that
interest rates charged on all DBWS's existing and future loans
should  be  increased  to a minimum of  13 per cent.    The
Consultants implementing the TA had found that increased rates
of this magnitude would be required if DBWS were to become
profitable  and,  eventually,  self-sustaining.    However  the
recommendation was not accepted although the interest rates for
some classes of agriculture loans were increased to 10 per cent
and individual and service sector interest rates were increased
to 13.0 and 14.0 per cerlt depending on the type of enterprise
being supported.
17.    ;  Provision of relatively low cost term  loans has
therefore been a central element of DBWS's lending policies with
tthe agriculture sector being provided particular priority.
B.   Characteristics of Subloans
18.       The fifth Bank Loan to DBWS and the co-financed IDA
Credit were utilized to finance a total of 2963 subloansd/.
Of these, 24 subloan utilizing a total amount of $1.8 million
were above the free limit of $50,000. The main characteristics
of subloans and the pattern of their distribution by sector and
size are shown in the Basic Data Sheet.
19.       The sectoral utilization of the Loan was not fully
consistent with expectations at the time of appraisal (see para
13) with 29.6 per cent of disbursements financing agriculture
and fishing projects, 18.5 per cent financing transport
projects, 18.0 per cent financing tourist accommodation, 17.4
per cent financing manufacturing projects, 5.4 per cent
financing village education facilities and the balance of 11.1
1J   Each subloan was financed on a 67 percent, 33 percent
basis from the Bank and IDA Loans. Subloan data in
this Report refers to the disbursement from the Bank
Project unless indicated otherwise.



- 15 -
per cent financing other service sector projects.
20.       The above-free-limit sub-projects, which accounted for
37.5 per cent of Loan utilization, were distributed fairly
evenlY between tourist accommodation and food processing
projects and included upgrading of a brewery, establishment of
a soft-drink factory, and establishment of small-food and
coconut-cream manufacturing plants.
21.       of the 117 sub-projects receiving subloans of more
than $10Sr000  only 10 were located on the second island of
Savai'i. The balance were located on the main island of Upolu
with most being located in or close to Apia.   Twenty sub-
projects were for the establishment of new facilities while 28
were classified as balancing, modernization or rehabilitation
projects. The majority of these larger sub-projects (69% per
cent) were for the expansion of existing businesses.
22.       The Project Completion Review (PCR) Mission found that
the Loan proceeds had been utilized in an appropriate manner in
terms of supporting investment in a diverse range of economic
sectors that are important for Western Samoa's economic
development. The relatively low proportion of larger subloans
(17 per cent) financing new projects was principally a
reflection of the relatively difficult investment climate in
Western Samoa.   As with other small Pacific Island nations,
Western Samoa's small population base, remoteness from larger
markets and limited natural resources are factors which make the
identification of profitable new investment opportunities
difficult. A disappointingly low proportion of the larger sub-
projects (8.5 per cent) were located on the les developed
island of Savai'i.
23.       The larger sub-projects (ie. receiving subloans of
$10,000 equivalent or more) accounted for about 70 per cent of
total funds utilized under the Project.  The remaining funds
were provided to 2846 small sub-projects, mainly in the
agriculture sector. The average size of subloan provided to
these smaller sub-projects was around WS$110O and, given the low
interest yield on small agriculture loans, this portion of the
loan's utilization would have resulted in a significant
operating loss to DBWS.
C.   ImDlementation and Initial Ooeratign of Sub-orciects
1.   Implementation Status
24.       At the date of the PCR Mission in March 1992, all sub-
projects financed under the Bank Loan had been fully
implemented.   Of the 117 larger sub-projects,  15 incurred
significant cost overruns during the implementation stage
totalling WS$1.35 million.   of this amount, WS$835,264 was
accounted  for  by  one  sub-project,  which  involved  the
construction of two factory buildings on Upolu.   This sub-



- 16-
project incurred the cost overruns as a result of a significant
change in the scope of the undertaking.   However, the cost
overruns were appropriately financed and the Company has
subsequently operated with reasoniable profits.  A relatively
large  cost  overrun  of  WS$250,000  was  incurred  in  the
modernization of Western Samoa Breweries Ltd's plant. However,
this cost overrun represented only 5.9 per cent of the sub-
project's original cost estimates and did not significantly
affect the subsequent financial performance of the company.
25.       Of the total expenditure of WS$13.0 million incurred
in implementing the 117 sub-projects, OBWS financed WS$14.0
million (42.4 per cent) from the Bank Loan (WS$7.8 million), the
IDA Credit (WS$3.8 million) and from internal sources (WS$2.4
million). Sponsors provided .S$9.0 million (27.3 per cent) of
total financing and WSS10.0 million (30.3 per cent) was provided
from other sources, principally commercial banks. Appendix 3
provides details of the implementation of the sub-prc;ects.
26.       Procurement under the Bank Loan was mainly undertaken
on a local basis reflecting the relatively small size of sub-
projects. Of the larger sub-projects, competitive bids were
sought for construction contracts and international shopping
procedures were followed for purchase of larger plant items.
With three larger sub-projects, second-hand plant was procured
from  international  sources.    At  the  Bank's  insistence,
engineers' certificates Os to suitability, condition and price-
reasonableness were obtained. Appendix 4 provides a summary of
the pattern of procurement under the Project. The major source
country"for procurement was Japan with 38.0 per cent followed by
New Zealand with 37.7 per cent. The PCR Mission found that the
procurement procedures utilized by DBWS were in accordance with
the Bank's Guidelines and Practices for South Pacific countries.
2.   Financial  Performance and Current Status of Sub-
proiects
27.       Appendix 5 provides a summary of data on the initial
financial performance of the larger sub-projects financed under
the Loan. The PCR Mission noted that, while review of the
financial performance of sub-projects financed under earlier
Bank loans to DBWS had been difficult because of a paucity of
performance information on file, in this case relatively good
records had been maintained within DBWS, Of the 117 larger sub-
projects, five had failed and were inoperative at the time of
the PCR Mission.   A further 22 had encountered significant
difficulties and were not able to properly service their loans
from DBWS.   The  remaining 90 sub-projects were operating
satisfactorily and did not have any hard-core arrears with DBWS.
28.       The two cyclones that struck Western Samoa during 1990
and 1991 (Cyclone Ofa in February 1990 and Cyclone Val in
December 1991) were major contributing factors to the failure
and/or difficulties of some sub-projects.   one sub-project
(Maurice Thompson) had been for the establishment of a poultry



-17-
farm.   The project had encountered difficulties from delayed
start up, cost overruns and husbandry problems.  While these
problems were receiving appropriate attention, the farm was
completely destroyecl by Cyclone Ofa. Likewise the prospects for
rellabilitating Samoa bee and lioney Co Ltd, which had already
encountered significant production and marketing problems were
virtually nullified as a result of damage from Cyclone Ofa.
29.       The PCR Mission found that poor evaluation of market
potential and inadequate understanding of the management
requirements for particular industries were the most prevalent
causes   of   difficulties  with  the  larger   sub-projects.
Inadequate appraisal skills within DBWS was an important factor
in lending decisions to sub-projects that encountered such
difficulties, particularly with sub-projects in the food-
pro assing and tourism sectors.  It was also apparent from a
review of sub-project files that inappropriate action by some
members of DBWS's Board had resulted in the reversal of
decisions based on sound analysis by DBWS's Management to
decline some loans.
30.       Despite these factors, the data presented in Appendix
5 indicates that around 70 per cent of the larger sub-projects
achieved acceptable financial performance, performed reasonably
close  to  expectations  or  exceeded  expectations.    Because
meaningful data is not available for most of the smaller sub-
projects, an assessment of their financial performance cannot be
made. One indication of that performance may be DBWS's poor
portfolio collection performance (see paras 50 to 53).  It is
also poisible however that poor portfolio collection has been as
much a function of inadequate portfolio control and poor credit
discipline as it has been a function of poor sub-project
performance.
3.   Economic Performance of Sub-Droiects
31.       Data on the economic performance of sub-projects were
largely unavailable. Appendix 6 summarizes the available data
on incremental value added, incremental foreign exchange
savings, incremental employment and investment cost per job of
the 117 larger sub-projects. From the available data, 48 sub-
projects generated WS$2.7 million of value added from their
first full year of operations. This figure was significantly
less than the WS$4.9 million projected at sub-project appraisal.
Seventeen sub-projects generated total incremental foreign
exchange earnings or savings of WS$3.9 million during their
first full year of operation.  DBWS had estimated that those
sub-projects would generate foreign exchange savings or earnings
of WS$5.7 million per annum. 495 new jobs were created from the
117 sub-projects at an average investment cost per job of
WS$47,391.
32.       While the average estimates of economic benefits for
these sub-projects that had been made by DBWS appear to have
been overstated, the available data indicate that the Project



-18-
did generate significant benefits from the larger Sub-projects.
The smaller subloans were provided to families, individuals and
small enterprises that would otherwise encounter very real
difficulties in obtaining access to credit from formal sources.
Trhe Project would ttierefore have provided significant assistance
in promoting involvement of low income groups in non-subsistence
activities.
D.   The Technical AssistAnce
The TA was provided as four separate components as follows:
i)   Industrial Sector Survey
33.       Six man-months of consulting services were provided to
indicate the directions in which the promotion of industrial
projects in Western Samoa should proceed. The PCR Mission found
that, while a comprehensive report had been prepared with well-
reasoned recommendations for both DBWS and the Government,
little or any changes were subsequently implemented to Western
Samoa's industrial investment environment. The Mission was not
able to identify any significant change to DBWS's operations or
policies that had arisen directly trom this component of the TA.
This was a somewhat disappointing outcome for this component of
the TA which may have resulted from a relatively low priority
being given to industrial development issues within the
Government. The Bank may have been able to promote a more
productive response to the TA's findings through more assertive
policy dialogue.
ii) Proiect Promotion
34.       The TA provided nine man-months of consulting services
to establish a coherent project promotion program within DBWS
and to upgrade DBWS's project promotion expertise.
35.       The Mission was unable to identify any  residual
benefit at all from this component of the TA. It was apparent
to the Mission that the availability of experienced staff within
DBWS with sound commercial experience and some sense of
entrepreneurship was, and remains, quite limited. Given these
constraints, DBWS's Management has tended to provide a higher
priority to utilizing such staff within the lending and
investment operations.    The attempt to develop  a project
promotion capability has therefore been unsuccessful because of
the difficulties in staffing the function appropriately.
iii) Im2rovement in DBWS's Accountina and Manaaement
Information Systems
36.       This component of the TA provided six man months of
consulting services to upgrade DBWS's accounting and management



- 19-
information  systems  (MiS).   Apart from preparation of an
accounting manual, the major task under this component was to
identify and specify the most appropriate hardware and software
for computerization of DBWS's accounting and MIS.
37.       The Mission found that, while the consultants had
prepared  detailed  and  carefully  evaluated  recommendations
regarding the computerization component, DBWS's Management had
chosen not to implement those recommendations because of
concerns regarding the cost of the systems that had been
recommended&l.    Instead,  it had  been decided  to purchase
minimal computer hardware and develop software as an in-house
exercise. By the time of the March 1990 Review Mission to DBWS,
this had proven to be largely unsuccessful and DBWS's accounting
systems and MIS had shown little improvement from the time of
Loan appraisal. TA 1399 has however subsequently assisted the
successful rebuilding and enhancement of DBWS's computerized
accounting systems.
iv) Aaricultural Credit
38.       The order to improve DBWS's approach to assisting the
agriculture sector, six man-months of consulting services were
provided to improve strategies and procedures.
39.       The PCR Mission found that this component of the TA
had resulted in the implementation of approaches to agricultural
lending that had markedly improved the efficiency of DBWS's
agriculture operations.   However, although efforts initiated
under the TA to prortote the use of credit unions for channelling
agricultural  credit received sustained support from D8WS's
Management, these efforts eventually failed, perhaps because of
cultural factors.
E.   Overational Performance of DBWS
1.   Organization. ManageMent and Staffing
40.       Appendix 7 provides an outline of DBWS's organization
structure at 30 September 1991. Since the appraisal of Loan No.
707-SAM, DBWS has undergone two re-organizations, the most
recent being undertake during early 1991 in response to
recommendations provided under TA 1399-SAM. 
41.       The major differences between the 1991 and  1984
11   The cost of the recommended system was approximately
$25,000 with the benefit of hindsight DBWS's
Management has realised that this cost was in fact
reasonable and that through earlier implementation of
the new system, considerable costs could have been
saved through improved portfolio control.



-20-
organization structures include the addition of a second
assistant General Manager (AGM) position. The responsibilities
at this level are now divided on functional lines between an AGM
Loan  operations   antd  an  AGM  Finance,   Development  and
Administration,. Other major differences include the division of
loan operations on geographic lines rather than on a sectoral
bass.s, as was the case in 1984; the strengthening of the
personnel and training functions and; the upgrading of the
senior finance and securities positions to manager level.
Within the three loans divisions, functional responsibilities
have been reorganized to promote significantly enhanced
accountability at all professional staff levels for loan
decision-making and portfolio management.
42.       The PCR Mission considers that DBWS's Management has
provided appropriate responses during the period of the Loan's
utilization to DBWS's changing organization requirements. The
organization changes implemented during early 1991 in particular
have been a key factor in recent improvements to DBWSts
portfolio quality (See para 52).
43.       DBWS's  Board  of  Directors  is  appointed  by  the
Government and comprises ten members including the Financial
Secretary as Chairman, the General Manager of DBWS, two other
ex-officio Directors and six Directors representing the private
sector. At the time of Loan appraisal, the Chairman of the
Board was the Minister oC Finance. This was changed, following
consultation with the Bank, in December 1984.
44.    *  During the period of Loan utilization, the composition
of DBWS's Board has been significantly changed three times. The
first of these changes occurred in early 1985 following
consultations with the Bank and with the intent of broadening
the sectoral representation on the Board.  The second change
occurred in early 1987 following amendments to the DBWS Act that
removed fixed tenure provisions from the Act and provided for
Board appointment to be at the pleasure of the Government. A
March 1990 Bank Review Mission pointed out to the Government
that the Bank had not been consulted on these changes, as was
required under Loan Covenants and expressed concerns that the
current composition of the Board may not promote DBWS's
financial and operational integrity. The Mission also pointed
out that, again in breach of Loan Covenants, DBWS Directors were
beneficiaries of subloans.   The Government subsequently re-
examined DBWS's Board composition and following implementation
of TA 1399-SAM, made appropriate changes.
45.       The PCR Mission found that for a period during the
Loan's utilization, DBWS's Board had operated in a manner that
may not have been in DBWS's best interests. In particular, some
Directors had become over-involved in aspects of DBWS's day-to-
day operation and had created a difficult environment for DBWS's
Management. It is noteworthy however that, once the Government
realized the detrimental effect this situation was having on
DBWS's operational status, appropriate corrective action was
taken. DBWS's Board currently operates in a manner that is



-21-
promoting the rehabilitation of the Institution.
46.       Two changes have been made in the appointment of
DBWs's General Manager since Loan Appraisal.   In both cases
well-qualified individuals were appointed following public
advertising of the position and transparent evaluation of
applications.
47.       DBWS has maintained a stable staff throughout the
period of Loan utilization and a strong cadre of reasonably-well
qualified and seasoned staff has been retained.   Total staff
strength increased from 90 at Loan appraisal to 105 at the end
of 1991.   Although the adequacy of internal staff training
programs has fluctuated during the period depending on the
quality of staff appointed to the position of Training Officer,
this function has received appropriate priority during 1991 and
early 1992.
2.   Lending operations
48.       An analysis of DBWS's lending operations by sector,
location, project size and loan maturity for the period 1985 to
1991, is presented in Appendix 8. Following relatively steady
but slow growth in the value of total approvals between 1985 and
1968 (during 1986 and 1987, approvals were around 35 per cent
less than projected by ttie Appraisal Mission), DBWS experienced
a rapid growth in approvals from the 1988 figure of WS$7.9
million to WS$12.8 million in 1989.  Most of this growth was
accounred for by a few large projects in the industrial and
tourism sectors. Subsequently, approval levels fell to WSS9.4
million during 1990 and to WS$6.0 million during 1991. By 1990
DBWS was encountering liquidity constrains resulting from poor
collection performance and the Bank's reluctance to consider a
further  line-of-credit  project  until  DBWS's  operational
performance  improved.    Consequently,  DBWS's  Management was
forced to restrict approval levels according to projected cash
inflows.
49.       Upolu continued to receive the highest proportion of
loans through the period (72 per cent during 1985 and 81 per
cent during 1991) reflecting the larger population base of that
Island.  Average loan size increased from WS$3914 during 1985 to
WS$65G9 during 1991 with a high of WS$11814 during 1989. Apart
from external factors including inflation, this increase in loan
size reflected the response of DBWS's Management to the losses
incurred  from  provision  of  small  agriculture  loans.    A
significant proportion of DBWS's loans (96 per cent by number
during 1985 and during 1991) were provided with maturity periods
of less than five years, reflecting the nature of agriculture
lending but also the expected economic life of the goods
procured.



.22-
F.   Financial Performance of DB_W
1.   Size and Quality of Loan Portfolio
50.       Appendix 9 peovides an analysis of DBWS's portfolio
arrears during the period 1985 to 1991 and AppendiX 10 provide
a summary of DBWS's portfolio collection performance during the
same period. DBWS's ratio of total arrears to total portfolio
value has remained at levels close to 20 per cent since
appraisal of the Loan. This was despite writing off bad debts
to a total of WSs8.7 million during the period and despite an
increase in portfolio value from WS$24.1 million at 30 September
1985 to WS$40.0 million at 30 September 1991. Of total arrears
at 30 September 1991 of WS$8.1 million, 13.2 per cent were due
from the large agriculture loan portfolio and 30.9 per cent were
due from industrial and service sector borrowers. At that date
78.2 per cent of total arrears were classified as hard-core
(overdue by more than 12 months and/or under legal action).
51.       A covenant under Loan No. 707-SAM required that DBWS
prepare and implement an arrears reduction plan that was
satisfactory to the Bank. The covenant required that the plan
have an objective of reducing arrears to a maximum of 10 per
cent of total portfolio value by 31 December 1985.   The PCR
Mission found that DBWS's Management had been diligent in
undertaking initial actions to satisfy this covenant.   As a
result, DBWS's annual collection ratio increased from 42.3 per
cent for FY1985 to 50.4 per cent for FY1986. However, it is
apparent that arrears reduction did not receive appropriate
ongoing attention and the collection ratio fell to 43.4 per cent
for the subsequent year.
52.       During  March  1990,  DBWS  requested  (through  the
Government) that the Bank consider provision of a further line-
of-credit. A Bank Review Mission to DBWS during March 1990
reviewed this request and advised DBWS that its poor portfolio
performance was a key consideration for the Bank and that DBWS
did not currently meet the Bank's minimum performance criteria
for a repeat Loan. Subsequently the Bank provided technical
assistance (TA 1399-SAM) to DBWS to address that situation. As
a result of DBWS's subsequent changes in approach to lending and
portfolio management, the annual collection ratio increased to
57.4  per  cent  for  FY  1991.    Indications  are  that  this
performance has subsequently continued to improve.
53.       The PCR Mission found that the reasons for DBWSS's poor
collection performance have included inadequate and out-of-date
accounting and MIS, lack of assertiveness on the part of DBWS's
Management and Staff in promoting a public image that DBWS would
require diligent performance by its borrowers, a degree of
politicisation of DBWS's Board of Directors that detracted from
the level of autonomy afforded to DBWS's Management and lowered
staff morale and poor credit discipline that may reflect some
cultural factors. The efforts by DBWS's Chairman and Management



-23 -
during 1991 and 1992 to address these factors have been
noteworthy and indications are that DBWS's portfolio may perform
in accordance with the Bank's criteria by early of mid 1993.
2.   Financial Position
54.       Appendixes 11, 12 and 13 provide comparative income
statements, cashflow statements and balance sheets for DBWS for
the period FY1985 to FY1991.
55.       The income statements show that DBWS has achieved a
mixed but relatively mediocre profit performance. Net operating
income before tax and before special contributions from
Government over the period totalled a loss of WS$4.1 million.
Taking account of all taxation transactions and contributions
from Government, the net operating deficit for the period was
ws$3.6 million. The major cause of this relatively substantial
loss was provisions for doubtful debts which totalled WS$13.7
million over the period. The ratio of other operating expenses
to total assets at around 5.0 per cent had remained less than
average interest spread during each year (interest spread
achieved was a low of 4.4 per cent for FY 1984 and a high.of 8.9
per cent for FY1986).
56.       Mainly as a result of relatively long grace periods on
the earlier bank Loans,,, DBWS was able to maintain good debt
service coverage throughout the period until FY1991. During FY
1991 this ratio was 1.8 times, a significant decline from the
FY1989 -figure of 4.6 times despite an increase in client loan
repayments from WSS5.0 million to WS$8.8 million. Total debt
service requirements increased from WS$0.8 million in FY1984 to
WS$2.0 million in FY1989 to WS$6.5 million in FY1991.   It is
apparent that as DBWS's loan service requirements increase in
future years, the importance of achieving significantly improved
profitability and portfolio collections will be reflected in an
otherwise increasingly difficult liquidity situation.
57.       DBWS encountered difficulties in meeting the Bank
covenant requiring maintenance of a maximum 3:1 debts:equity
ratio. This ratio reached a high of 4:1 at 30 September 1985 but
was subsequently reduced through further equity injections from
the Government. At 30 September, DBWS's total paid up capital
from the Government was WS012.4 million an increase of 158 per
cent from the 30 September 1984 figure of WS$4.8 million and
sufficient to give a 1.9:1 debt:equity ratio.
G.   CovenAnts
58.       Details of the loan covenants and their compliance
status are given in Appendix 14.   Although most covenants
regarding DBWS's financial condition and reporting requirements
were substantially complied, some key covenants were breached.
Two important covenants requiring that DBWS Directors should be
appointed for two consecutive terms of three years each and



-24-
precluding DBWS Directors from being beneficiaries of subloans
under the Project were not adhered to. Both covenants had been
introduced because of concerns held by the Bank at the manner in
which OBWS's Board was operating and their breach occurred
during a period whetn those concerns proved to be valid.  A DBwS
Director was the majority shareholder of Natural Foods Ltd, one
of the large sub-projects financed under the Loan.   Sincere
concerns held by DBWS Management regarding the viability of the
sub-project and the approach taken to its implementation were
not taken account of and quite substantial lending to the
company was undertaken. Moreover, the government's actions in
substantially changing the composition of DBWS's Board on two
occasions may have been an important factor in DBWS's poor
institutional performance during the loan utilization period.
59.       The Government and DBWS were required under loan
covenants to undertake annual reviews of DBWS's interest rate
structure and to consult the Bank prior to any changes being
made to that structure.   This covenant appears to have been
largely disregarded and the primary intention of the covenant,
that DBWS maintain interest rates that would allow for
profitable operation, was not satisfied.
60.       Another covenant requiring DBWS to submit an arrears
reduction plan by 31 December 1984 providing for a reduction in
DBWS's arrears ratio to 10 per cent by 31 December 1985 was met.
However, reductions in ajrears of that magnitude were not made
and the expectation that they could have been may have been
unrealistic.
H.   The Bank's Performance
61.       The fifth Bank loan to DBWS was declared effective on
13 May 1985, only six days later than the original closing date
for  loan effectiveness.    The Bank's turn around time  for
processing of below free limit subloans averaged 19 days and for
above free limit subloans was between 3 weeks and two months
including the time taken in seeking clarification and additional
information. This turn around time was considered acceptable by
DBWS's Management.
62.       The Bank mounted review missions to DBWS on an annual
basis apart from during 1986 when staff constraints at the
Bank's South Pacific Regional Office precluded such a mission.
The coverage of the Review Mission reports was generally
satisfactory apart from some lack tf attention to breaches of
key covenants. The PCR Mission considers that, had the Bank
taken a firmer stance with DBWS and the Government in 1987
following the breaches of covenants related to DBWS's arrears
situation and Board composition, corrective action may have been
initiated earlier and DBWS's current condition may consequently
have been enhanced.

III. EVALUATION
A.   Appraisal
63.       The  appraisal  mission's  evaluation  of  DBWS's
institutional capabilities and of Western Samoa's private sector
investment environment was sound and appropriate. However, the
approach taken to correct deficiencies in DBWS's operational
condition and capabilities may have been flawed. In particular,
to  require  thorough  covenants  that  DBWS  correct  major
deficiencies such as poor portfolio quality within a given time
frame may not have been realistic.
64.       This aspect apart, the project design was reasonable
and the technical assistance was carefully specified to address
major problem areas for DBWS's management and operation.  The
Mission considers that the formulation of the Project and the
quality of appraisal were satisfactory.
B.   Implementation
65.       Overall implementation of the Project has been only
partially successful. While implementation of sub-projects has
been satisfactory, DBWS1's institutional development has not.
The Mission considers that, had the Government and DBWS taken
more accour.: of key covenants and had the Bank been more
forceftl in requiring performance against those covenants, DBWS
would be in a significantly stronger position than at present
and would therefore be a more effective Institution.
IV. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
66.       The utilization of the Bank loan has on the whole,
been satisfactory and the loan has achieved its purpose of
extending assistance to a wide range of private sector
development projects in Western Samoa. However, DBWS did not
make the progress that was expected of it during the Project
implementation period in terms of its own institutional
development. Given the amount of technical assistance provided
by the Bank to DBWS prior to, and as part of the loan, this lack
of progress was disappointing and, as a result, the Project can
only be considered a partial success.
67.       In response to this situation the Bank has already
provided further assistance to DBWS through TA 1399-SAM. The
Mission considers that the work undertaken under that TA has
provided well-argued recommendations that collectively provide
a sound format for addressing DBWS's underlying problems. These
recommenidations have been generally well received by DBWS and
the Government and many of them are under implementation.



-26 -
68.       The Bank has been DBWS's most important supporter to
date in terms of providing resources for on-lending and
technical  assistance  for  institutional  development.    The
Government has again requested the Bank (since March 1990) to
continue this support.
69.       It  is  recommended  that  in  responding  to  the
Government's request for further funding to DBWS, the Bank
should continue to insist on the achievement of minimum
performance standards as a prior condition to final processing
of a further project. In this regard, SPRO review missions to
DBWS have advised the Government and DBWS's Management that, not
only should DBWS seek to achieve a minimum 70 per cent annual
collection ratio and improved profitability, but that key
recommendations   provided  under  TA1399   should   also  be
appropriately responded to and that DBWS's financial performance
should match that budgetted for under the TA. Such an approach
would recognize the substantial assistance provided to DBWS by
the Bank in the past and would underscore the importance the
Bank attaches to performance standards for a relatively mature
development finance institution.  In following this approach,
the Bank would need to take care in specifying to the Government
and to DBWS's Management, what its performance criteria are for
this type of institution.

`or  the  completion  and  commissioning  of the  project  are
appropriately covered; this will also take into consideration
appropriate care for cost overrun that may reasonably need to be

project and after having ensured that such disbursement will be
in line with the requirements of the investment schedule o the
project.
1S. The repayment period of the loans to the Bank, including a
grace period as appropriate and needed, will be determined

IV. Diversification of portfolio
21. In order to reduce the concentration of risk the Bank will
seek to diversify its portfolio by sectors of operations and by
avoiding inappropriately large investment.   In view of its
development function, the Bank will also pursue geographical
diversification of its portfolio.
22. The Bank's equity investment shall serve mainly as a
catalytic agent for the establishment of new enterprises and the
Bank will endeavor to dispose of such equity investments as soon
as this becomes feasible and a reasonable price can be obtained
therefrom.
23.  The Bank will not commit to a single enterprise in the form
of equity participation more that five per cent of its

Fund.

enterprise in the industrial sector including the
Bank's own investment; and
iii. eighty per cent of the total assets of such enterprise
including the Bank's own investment in agricultural
sector.
25. In exceptional cases meriting special consideration, limits
under Clause 24(ii) and (iii) may be exceeded provided the loan
is covered by adequate additional security over assets not
forming part of the project.
26. In financing worthwhile projects requiring more that its
maximum lending limits under Clause 24, the bank may seek
syndicated co-operation of other financial institutions, both
domestic and foreign, limiting the Bank's liability.
V.   Finacial Guidelines:
27.       The Bank will review and determine from time to time
the rates of interest and fees to be applied to its advance in
the light of prevailing government policy and developments in

borrowings.



-31.-
Page 5 of 5
28.       The Bank will not carry the exchange risk on its debts
payable in foreign currency.  The Bank will endeavor to have
such risk assumed by Government or by a Government agency. In

bear the foreign exchange risk relating to its repayment of
debts in foreign currency such a risk will e passed on to the
Bank's borrowers.

reflect its business operations in accordance with sound and
generally accepted accounting principles and practices.

percent of its approvals of loans, equity investments and
guarantees in that year as a provision against bad and doubtful
debts until such times as the provisions equal ten percent of

thereafter set aside annually such amounts as are sufficient to
maintain this provision at least at that level.

PRWACE
TMs Is a Project Compledon Report (PCM) for the Tonga Developament Bank
(1DB) Project, for which Credit 1813-TON in the amount equivalent to SDR 1.6 million
(approimately US$2.0 million) was approved by the Board on June 2, 1987. The credit
was sied on July 15, 1987, and becme effectve on Septmber 28, 1987. The Credit
Closing Date was December 31, 1990. The account was closed on April 8, 1991, and an
undsbrsed balance of SDR 20,826.56 was canceled. The first repayment under the Credit
s due October 15, 1997.
The PCR was prepared by staff of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), with
whom the Intrnational Development Association (IDA) cofinaced the ProJect, following
an ADB mision to Tonga in June 1989. Under an agreement between the Assocaton ad
the ADB, ADB had prmary responsibilty for overall project fomultion and appraisal, and
for subsequent superviion of project iplementaon, including prepaation of tbe PCR.
The PCR is accompanied by an evWluation sumay (including stascal data on subprojects
financed with IIA proceeds that are not covered In the PCR) prepared by IDA staff. 1/
The IDA's evaluation sunmary draws on the IDA's President's Memoran

1. Project Identity
Project Name:        Tonga Development Bank Project
Credit Number.       1813-TON
Regional Unit:       Asia and Pacific Region-Country Department m
Country:             Tonga
Sector:              Financial Intermediation
Subsector:           Development Banking
2. Background
2.1         Ihe Tonga Development Bank (IDB) Project was approwved as the
nternational Development Association's (IDA's) first credit to the Kigdom of Tonga.
Tonga had joined the World Bank Group In September 1985, after which a Country
Economic Memorandum (CEM) was prepared and dscussed with the Governmeat In
response to an emerging resource gap for term-finncing identified in the TDB, IDA was
formally requested by the Government in December 1986 to coflnance ADB's third lding
operation to the IDB, which had been processed s sly  with an ADB mukiproject
This loan [Loan No. 782-TON(SF)J had become effective in October 1986. The project
conformed with IDA's country lending stregy of supporting the development of ky secton
(agricultre, industry, and tourism) in the country. The TDB, the primary source of term
finacing for these sectors, was considered an appropriate financa  nmediary for
implementng this sateg. Te TDB had been established in 1977, with ADD astae,
to provide capital in support of national economic develpment Up to May 1987, the ADB
had made dtree loans to the TDB totling US$3.5 million equival  and four technical
assistance (TA) grants totalling USS623,000.
2.2         TDB's overall profitability during its first seven years of operatons was
attributable to income received on eaning assets other ta loans. The Kingdom's legislated
interest rate ceiling of 10 percent (as per the Contracts Act of 1921) and high aministrative
costs associated with the TDB's large number of small loans (accounting for approxImately
20 percent of its loan portfolio) resulted in an acual negative spread on its overall lending

operatlons.l  In addition, because of Tonga's high rate of inflation, tis  ant that
deposit and lending rates were generally negative in real terms. This issue was dbcussed
with the Govermen during review of the CEM and was taken up under the prject's
interest rate policy objective.
3. ProJect ObJectives and Description
3.1         The objective of this cofmanced project was to provide long-erm resources
(USS1.0 million equivalent from ADB and US$1.8 million equivalent from IDA) to help
fhnmce investment demand in the agriculture, industry, and tourism sectors during a three-
year commitent period ending end-1989, and to reform interest rate policy so as to achiev
positive real deposit and lending rates. In addition, an institutional strengting program
wa expected to improve TDB's operational efficiency and profitability (including IDA funds
of US$140,000 equivalent for hardware and software necessary to complete TDB's
computeriion  program, and US$60,000 equivalet for a consultat review of TDB's
prospect for diversification, focusing on the feasibility of diversifying TDB's domestic
resource base and copond    financing operations).
4. Project Design and Oganization
4.1         The TDB Project, like most of the Bank Group's DFC-pe lending operato
up to that time, focused on a single financial inermediary and comprised a credit line
component along wPi a technical assistance (TA) component aimed essentially at
institutnal iroVement (computerizing TDB's accounting system, developing permsel
management policies, identifying diversificadon prospects, improving portfolio quait). To
ths extent, project design was very similar to the two previous ADB opeao. In
addion, the project explicily addressed the need for interet rate policy refom  Both ADB
(in its Jany 1986 apr ) and IDA (in its Wupdadng" mssion in Febuary 1987) bad
cormed that TDB's overall opeaional performance was s; at the sme time,
they had noted that the Kingdom's interest rate ceiling of 10 percent prevented TDB not
ondy from adopting an appropriate onlending interest rate strucure but also from resourc
funds other than Govement equity and concessionary borrowings. Recognizing the need
- for interest rate policy reform in order to remedy lDB's poor profitability on is leding
activities, both ADB and IDA legal documents incorporated covenanted deadlines for
reaching agreement on an acdon program, including an implementaion schedule, that wol
allow the development of a market-based interest rate strucure in the Kigdom towm
postive real deposit and knding rates over the medium to long-term.    hntr  ra
policy initave  crporatd In this project proved very important, as it laid the groundwork
for a foliow-up project under which the reform was subsequently completed (see para. 6.1
below).
V As discsd inpaps. 6 of h Memorandum nd          of th  esd  (Repopt No. P.4W57-
TON) dted May 13, 1987. ADB has on_ t  however, that TDB has always ahived a posi
inst spead on its leding opeaons (refer AtahwAa B).

S. Implementaion
5.1         The TDB Project was executed In accordance with the "Letter of Credt
AdmnIstration  between ADB  and IDA  (dated February 22, 1988), wherein all
administratve arrngem s of the IDA Credit were outlined. As pat of s gener  aegy
of cost-effective lending to fth Pacific hland counties, the Bank Group in 1980 had decided
to lnd through cofiacing opeions with the ADB. Under thi a mnt, ADB had
responsibility for  dminisrng  is project for IDA, I.e., subprojec  procsi,
procuremet montoring, processing of witrawal applications, supervison, monito   of
audit and periodic reports, and the PCR. There had been little direct consultation and
collaboration between the ADB and IDA during the preparation of dteir respective projecs
(athough IDA  did use ADB's appraisal as the basis of its Me          m   and
Reommendation of the President). While ADB adm      ed entirely the credit and
computrztion components under IDA Cr. 1813-TON, IDA took a direct and active role
(ncuing  a June 1988 mission) in supervising the project's policy component 1; a res
of dis direct involvement by IDA was closer collaboration with ADB dung the prepaation
of the follow-up IDB project in seeking stronger policy and Instittional idUonality.
Compiance with legal covenants was satisactory - refer Table 7 of "Stedtcal Inforaion".
5.2           Considering that this project represented IDA's first lending opeion in
To    and taking into account the procsing famework under which It was undeaken,
project design and  qecaions appear to have been reasonable and realistic. Moreover, in
dibss      fi e Implemenon of tffis project, it i important to note that the follow-up
project I.e., IDA's Second TDB Priject (Cr. 2084-TON) cofinanced with ADB's Fourth
TDB Project (Ln. 990-TON(SP)J represnted a truly collaborative effort: it was appraised
jointly in June 1989, became effective in August 1990, and was jointly supervised in
Fbuary 1991. As fiter elarated In Section 6 below, this folow-p coficing
operation not only enabled the policy refom iniaed under the 1DB Projet to be pushed
ahead, but resuled in fArter conditionality addressing a number of TDB's Inustttional
deficiencies that had come to light durng the inmplemnti  of th  projec  IThe mjor
risc, as identified by IDA at the time of appraisal, was that Implemenation of intr  rate
reform might be delayed or might not be as broad as was necessary to addre ditortons
In te financial sectr. While delayed was never defined, te eventual remowval of aR
interest rateceilings in Tong effective July 1, 1991, achieved the project's policy objecdve.
A second risk Identified at the time of appraisal, was ihat subsequt revision of TDB's
nternal onlendig inter   re strucre and impkmentatko  of acdons to Improve loan
quaty (which were not specifically identified) would not be undrtakn and that TDB's

(especially for its micro lending portfolio) and TDB's low profitability remain outstanding
and so far, unsatisfactorily addressed issues.
6. Results
6.1         Tho TDB Project sucoeeded in achieving its objectiva of inere rate policy
reform and resource transfer; while progress was satisfactory with respect to IDB's
intiIon-building objectve, greater emphasis was devoted to thi matr under the follow-
up project.
6.2         Polic Rdfr. Under Cr. 1813-TON, the Government agreed to prepare,
no later than June 30, 1988, an action programn, acceptable to IDA, for achieving a market-
oriented, flexible intest rate sucture. IDA accepted the Goven2ment's proposal of May
1988 outlining a timetable for achieving this. Implementation of the timetable, however,
was contngent upon implementation of the then-proposed National Reserve Bank (NRB)
legislin  (prepared wi TA provided by the Inoernational Monetary Fund), since it
provided the mecaism for Implementig intet rate reform. Ihe NRB becme fuly
on July 1, 1989. Announcing Its intention to promote a mairt-detmined
terest rate regme In Tonga that would reflect the stau of the finacial mariets of Tonga's
major trading partners, the NRB, as an interim move towards establishing such a policy,
raised the ceiling on lending rates to 13.5 percent effective that sme date. In early 1991,
the Contracts Act of 1921 was repealed, and on June 17, 1991 (effectve July 1, 1991), the
NRB announced the removal of the ceiling on interest rates - thus bringing the Borrower into
compliance with the covenant under Cr. 2084-IND providing for implementation of such a
policy by March 31, 1991.
6.3           Tuhe Trmsfer, Ih  TDB Project succeeded in the transfer of foreign
exchange resource for Invstmen, meeting both commitment and disbursement scheduls as
provided under the Project./ As noted in the PCR (refer para. 30), TDB's project
appraisal and supervision procedures have been generally satisfactory. At the tme of
appraisal, there wer no quantitave targets specified as to how the IDA funds should be
utlized (subproject data provided by TDB is summarized in Tables 9.A-D of "Statistcal
inf;ormation). As compiled by the TDB, a total of 141 subloans were fnanced, six of
which were above the *free-limimt of $40,000. Services (Including transportaton and
torism) accunted for almost 56 percent of funds; industry and manufacturing, almost 43
percent; and agiculture, less tm   2 percent.  Two-thirds of fimds went to existing
companies. Becuse data regarding actual subproject operational and finacial performance
is limited, due to the fact dt  most subprojects financed under the Credit have been
operatnal for only a hort time, a meaningful asessment of socio-economic benefits
derived from these invesmes is premre.  Available data on similarly financed
subpojects under the ADB loan, however, indicate satisfactory results (paras. 18-24 of the

PCR). Arrears data is more complete; on a positive note, 24 of the 43 largest borrowers
of IDA fimds (accounting for approxinately 50 percent of these funds) had no arrears (as
of May 31, 1992); only two of them (accourting for less than 15 percent of IDA funds)
acuted for 80 percent of the large borrowers' total arrears. [Arrears data on borrowers
financed with ADD funds is dscussed in para 25 of the PCR.J
6.4         TDB'. Institional Develtm=    'TDB's numangent, suti  and
organizatinl structue, srengtned wAith TA provided by ADB and other bilaterals, are
deemed satisfctoty (pars. 26-28 ad 45 of the PCR). During project implementation, TDB
epanded its aset base almost thre-fold - from TS9.6 million at end-1986 to T$25.0 million
at end-1990; its loan portfolio aepanded from TS8.0 to 21.9 million during this same period.
During thi same period, return on average total assets (before taxes) fluctuated bewen 0.6
and 1.4 percent; return on average equity (after taxes) was very low, fluctuating between
1.3 and 1.9 percent 'IDB Is the m4jor source of term credit In Tonga and has contributed
sgnificantly to economic development In the Kingdom. (Refer parms. 29-36 and 44 of the
PCR.) It Is worth noting that since 1989, TDB's annual net incom has exceeded the
revenue genred by earig assets other        loans - prior to 1989, TDB's overall
profitality posion had derived from income eaned on aseu other than its loan portfolo.
As noted above, a number of  _Imrvements in TDB's personnel managmnt policies and
procedures, computerization of Its accounting system and staff training were Introduced
during project implemeion. However, in the course of project supervision, it was found
hat a  mber of TDB's Internal operaing ad accounting polIcies/procedures made it
difficult to evalue its true financil position and performance. Thus, as part of the follow-
up TDB project, several changes have been adopted by TDB's Board that reflect more
prudent lenig and financial practices, including modification of its policy of recogning
rest income on an accrual basis, limng such accals to performing (clearly defined)
lo   only, clear guidelines and procedus fo reschedulng and restructuig loans (and
lminating the captalz  of accrued inrest), and standardized procures for wring
off bad debt. WIth TA provided under an ADD grat, a Loa PortfoLo Review was
underken in 1990 by external consaDn; as a resul of th  review, TIDB's Board adopted
In 1991 a metodolo   for establishig adequate loan loss provisions based on repaymet
performance, qualit  of collater, and bonrower's oveall finacial position and
perfonnance. While the daa show that total and hard-core (i.e., of more dtan twelve
months) amrs steadily increased between tnd-1988 and end-1991 (reversing a decline in
such arrears during the previous tree yewrs), It Is  clear as to how much of this
detioration was real or the result of the TDB having instutd more prudent operating
and account   practices.  Howver, it should be noted that during th time, TDB
management took te pnuden acdon of iceasing provisions - from 6.8 percent of
outstandig loan portfolo as of end-1986, to 11.4 percent as of end-1991. TBD has also
initiated a numer of itral measu  to address its are   problem, including more
intenive contct with problem clients, strengtin of ieral do In      and collateral
procedures, and taking legal action a t delinquent borrowers (refer Attachment A).
6.5         One institonal iue ta remans unsatisfactory is IDB's onlending interes
rate strucue, especally with respect to Its micro-lending operations (i.e., loans of less ta
TS1,0O0). As identified at the time of project appraisal, and as confirmed by a review



-66 -
undertaken in 1990 by extenal consultants financed with an ADB TA grant under the
follow-up nroject, TDB's interest rate structure (even as revised upward in light of the July
1, 1989, and July 1, 1991, NRB announcements) does not allow TDB to recover its cost of
delivering, supervising and administering (including risk and appropriate profit margins)
smaller-sized loans (i.e., of up to T$3,SO0, which continue to account for about 25 percent
of TDB's annual loan approvals). While dated conditionality was incorporated under the
follow-up project providing that the Government would take the neceary meures to
compensae TDB for all costs associated with such lending (if for development reasons it
was felt that it would not be proper for llB to charge interest rates that would permit such
cost recovery), satisfactory action has yet to be taken.
7. Sustaiabiliy
7.1         On the macro side, the interest rate policy reform initiated under IDA Cr.
1813-TON/ADB Ln. 782-TON(SF), and subsequentiy completed through the NRB under the
follow-up cofinanced operation [i.e., IDA Cr. 2084-TON/ADB Ln. 990-TON(SP)J, lays a
strong foundation for furiher reform of Tonga's financial sector hat can be expet  to
promote donmstic savings, improve and rationalize the allocation of credit resources, and
encourage efficient private investment.  A Financial nion Act was passed by the
Legislative Assembly and became law in April 1992 - this will allow freign banks to
operate in the county and introduce competitveness in the market
7.2         On he instion-building side, it remains to be seen whether TDB can flly
develop into a self-sustaining and viable financial institution. Since its establihment in
1977, ADB and IDA have provided subsnial resources and technical assistance o TDB.
Proress has been made in improving TDB's operational and accounting policies and
procedures. However, profitability has been very low and TDB still needs to address a
substantial arreas problem. With the likelhood of increasing competition in the future, it
is crucial that TDB, with the Govenmnt's (as shareholder) support, take the necessary
steps to ensre t its lending rate stucte allows for full recovery of costs (including risk)
and provides for adequate profit margins; in those intances (specifically, regarding micro-
loans) where approprate lending rates would be considered too high on developmt and
socb-economic grounds, unrecovrble costs ought to be compensad dictly by the
Government and not cross-subsidized by TDB's other clients. Prospects for TDB's
susinability as a commercially viable (and expanding) intiton, especially in light of a
more liberalized financl sector, are further constrained by its dependence on govenment
equity and essentially concessionary funds from external aid donors; with an average amnual
cost of borrowings ranging between 2.9 and 3.4 percent during the past seven years (wih
the foreign exchange risk being bome by the Goverment) and domestic deposit rates in the
range of 6 to 8 percent, resource diversification options are limited - a concern shared by
TDB (refer Attachment A).
8. Association/Borower Performae
8.1         The Association's involvement in this project (refer Tabes 8.A and B of
'Statistical Informationw for details), aldtugh less staff-intensive than in its other South

Pacific DFC operations, was consiste  with the agreed procedures with ADD for such
cofinanced operations. lhe Goveanment's comnitmen to tie TDB Project's objectves was
clearly demontated by It actons with respect to the establismet of the NRB, which
subsequently led to the evental achievement of the interest rate policy reform promoted
under the project. It might be argued, In hindsight, that greater atention should have been
focused at the time of appraisal and even during supervision on the issues of TDB's finnlal
viability and commercial sustainability, specifically, its authority to adjust Its lending rates
in line with the macro" deregulation of interest rates. However, it should be recogized
that, once pogress was made on the macro front, a renewed emphasis was placed on TDB's
longer term viability and sustaabity, and these conern were reflected more extensively
in the follow-up project.
9. Lessons Leared
9.1         There are several lessons that can be leared from the TDB Project.
(a) To deal with issues related to a financial  sution's commercal viability and
sustlailty  it is important to have an apptopriate macro environment  With the
Kingdom's legally mandated inerest rate ceiling of 10 percent firmly in place at the tme of
asal, the TDB Project's expectation of a speedy impl aon of macro int    te
policy reformnn hinsght, was overly optimistic. As such, coreonig  expectations of
adopdon by TDB  of an appropriate onlending interest rate structue foowing
impl     on of the macro reform, diversification of its fimding resources to other than
quity capitl and concessionary loans, plus the emphasis on profitability as a major
intituional objective, proved premae;
(b) Single lending operaions with broad policy and institutional objectives would seem
to be too ambitious. A series of operations probably would be more reaistic in order to
hnge the macro enviroment and instional practices. Moreover, onoe an appropriate
macro finil famework is in place, it can be just as difficult to reorient previs thiking
and pracdtes, and to make the neesary instiuonal changes required to opere
competitvely in the new environm    Both the Borrower and the ADB/Association must
be prepaed not only to agree on an agenda of necessary acto  to cort previu
deficinces, but to implement them accordingly. In this regard, the follow-up TDB project
sets forth such an agenda;
(c) Familiarity with and und ing of the implementng agency's operaig policies
and inral pceds are extemely critical to both project design and imp     o
Lendin agencies must be wiling to devote adequate stffing resources in order to achine
this, thus facdlitg a productive dialogue witi the Borrower and maximizing prospect for
successfl implemenion of project objectives; and
(d) In a cofinanced operation, t is important to prooeed on a filly collaborative basis
to emure contnuity and also consistency in project supervision. The follow-up TDB project
[i.e., Ln. 990-TON(SP)/Cr. 2084-TONI was able tu draw successfully on experien - it
was Joiny appraised and, although not joily negotiated, all project procss    procedums

Dear Sir,
Fwther to your leter dawed 6 Janumary with the aaached report on the above-mentioned
bstject, I a  submiting herewith 7DB comments. Miniss,y of Finance wiU be preparing
sepately tleir comments as considered necessar.
On behalf of IDE mana8ement I want to thank you so much f,r the eforts being taken to
covmekte h Project Complerion Report. 7DB truly appreckuss the repon  wh in general,
truy rflects dse macro environent in which TDB operated duing the dme of appraisal as
well as IDB's overall performance.
1)    Regardfing die interest rate developments subsequent to project compktion, 7DB
fhe revieW au Interest rate strxcture In August 1992 (See Annex 1) to take account of a
downward siW In literest rates generaly. Rate reducins were offered  ' borrowers on aU
sectors and the opponunity was taken to restrncture the interest rate schedule in sewrnal
respects.
2)    JDB acknowedges the Associdon 's concenm  with 7DB's onk"ng berst rae
smature  wth respect to mico-lending operadons. TAis is panicularly wu, regard to
recovering ft cost of delivernng, administering and monitoring of such lan.
HoweVer. s a catalst of development especiall with the grass rot level who compose the
mjorfiy of those clients involved in micro-lending, it Is considered Inappropriate for 7DB

to charge rwes that would permit cost recovery. Current Indicators are that a .signt#cant
percentage of WD's micro accounts are in arrears. To increase lending rates on thems
acounts would only deteriorate the current slsawon. At the time of the last review it was
fek that die thim was not appropriate to seek compensaion for the cost of these loans.
TDB [&ao &dt1A& aWU Amars'
1)    7DB acowledges the deterioration it. te arrears position and Is seeking was of
addessing s arrears problems. Thse include overhaulng ofloan appralsal medsw, earlier

ncnary to prmote recovery. It must also be noted ta part of th problem associated with   Evaluation
accouns in arfears stem from the retarded growth experienced by the bank's traditional   Summry 
markets.
Ddvenfiiiokn of ThB'S fundi  resource Other-than egaui
I)   WVB ha recognised thefact that it can not indefinitely continue to depend on equiry
cgpkal and soft loans from credit lines. Furthennore, evaluation of the bank's perfonmnce
stronly ndates that there are not many bright prospects on the Bank's traditional mar*eis.   referencec
As such, TDB's Board recently adopted proposals to expand actiies to take up selected    in para.

71e probility of sccess is conaddered higher than any new foreign owned bank because:
-     7DB is totall localfy owned and already has a well developed

I. BAClGKROUND
A.  Briet HistorZ
1.       The Tonga Development Bank (TDB) was established under the Tonga
Developmer;t Bank Act of 1977, with the assistance of the Bank 1/ and atartid
operations on 1 September 1977. TDB is owned by the Government (94 per cent)
and the Bank of Tonga (BOT), a commercial bank (6 per cent). As of 31
December 1988, TDB's authorized capital was T$7.0 million, of which TS5.52 million
had been issued and fully paid-up. The Government and TDB have a close
working relationship and TDB generally conforms to the economic priorities set
by the Government through the national development planning programs. Under
the Act, the Government appoints TDB's Managing Director, directors
representing the Ministries concerned in TDB's operations Z/ as well as two of
the eight directors and the Chairman of the Board, usually the Minister of
Finance. Within this framework, TDB enjoys a reasonable degree of autonomy
in its day-to-day activities, including freedom to approve financial assistance
to individual projects/borrowers.
S. Sco=e of ODeRaZt_ns
2.       As set out in the TDB Act and TDB's Statement of Operating Policies
(Appendix 1), TDB's scope of operations covers all sectors of the economy
(except trade) and almost all types of financial or advisory ascistance (loans,
guarantees, equity participation, and technical, managerial and financial
consulttng services) including identification, formulation and promotion of new
business opportunities.
3.       TDB's main operational activity however remains the provision of
medium and long term loans to productive enterprises in the agricultural,
industrial and commercial sectors.
C. RelationshiD with the Bank and other Lenders
4.       Since TDB's establishment in 1977, the Bank has provided TDB three
loans totalling $3.5 million V and four technical assistance grants totalling
$623,000. The technical assistance has been for the establishment of TDB, TDB's
initial operation and staff training, upgrading TDB's expertise for the economic
evaluation of subprojects, for computerization of TDB's accounting system and
for review of TDB's personnel management policies and procedures.
1/  TA No. 174 for $240,000 approved in July 1976.
2/  Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and
Ministry of Labor, Commerce and Industries.
V   Loan No. 376-TON(SF) for $1.5 million approved in December 1978; 624-
TON(SF) for SDR 0.918 million ($1.0 million equivalent) approved in March
1983; and 782-TON(SF) for SDR 0.879 million ($1.0 million equivalent)
approved in June 1986.



.92 -
5.      In addition to Bank assistance, TDB has obtained through the
Government loans from International Fund for Agricultural Developnent (IFAD)
and from the International Development Association (IDA), which co-financed the
Bank's second and third loan, respectively, to TDB. TDB has also obtained loans
from the European Economic Community (EEC), the European Investment Bank
(EIB), the Governments of Australia and United Kingdom and BOT.
D.  Bationale for the Bank Loan
6.       The Bank's third loan to TDB of $1.0 million equivalent was intended
to augment TDB's foreign exchange resources for the purposs of extending loans
for specific development projects in the agricultural, industrial and services
sectors, thus supporting the Government's development objectives which
emphasized the high priority to be given to productive investment within these
sectors.
7.      An indicative sectoral utilization of ' the loan proceeds was:
agriculture (50 per cent), industry (30 per cent) and services including
transportation and tourism (20 per cent).
8.       To ensure that the objectives of the Bank loan were achieved and to
promote TDB's ongoing institutional development, specific covenants were
Included in the loan documents. These covenants required TDB to amend its
interest rate structure to reflect changes in the Government's interest rate
policies; to implement agreed recommendations from the review of TDB's
personnel management policies to be financed under Bank technical assistance;
to adopt an operating strategy formulating a more specific profit objective for
1987-1990; and to meet and maintain minimum annual collection ratios and
maximum hard-core arrears ratios.

II. IMPLEMENTATION
A.  Lendint and Interest Rate "PoLiies
9.       The basic document guidingt TDB's lending policies and operations is
its Statement of Operating Policies (see Appendix 1) which has remained
unchanged and continues to provide satisfactory guidance to TDB.
At the time of appraisal in January 1986, TDB's interest rates for
lending were:  6 per cent for top priority sectors (i.e. agriculture, fisheries,
livestock, natural resources); 8 per cent for high priority sectors (Le. export-
oriented industries, manufacturing, raw materials processing and tourism); and
10 per cent for other industrial and commercial loans. In '4arch 1986, TDB, in
consultation with the Bank, increased its Interest rate for top priority sector
lending to 8 per cent and also introduced a front-end fee on all new loans. The
major impediment to TDB charging a more market-oriented interest rate has been
the Contracts Act of 1921, which contains a provision limiting all interest rates
in Tonga to a maximum of 10 per cent. To assist the Government In developing
a more appropriate interest rate policy, technical assistance was provided as a
component of Part A of Loan No. 782 (the Multiproject Component) for a review
of interest rate policies.  The Consultant employed under this technical
assistance recommended that the interest rate ceiling be removed and that such
action should be combined with a more active exchange rate policy.l/
11.      During 1986-19388, the Bank continued to dialogue with the Government
on the need to establish a market-oriented interest rate structure. Due to the
need to link action on interest-rate reform with exchange-rate reform, the
Government has preferred to postpone such reforms until the appropriate
technical capabilities were in place.  In February 1989, the Government
established the National Reserve Bank (NM) which commenced operations from
1 July 1989 with appropriate expertise provided under International Monetary
Fund technical assistance. Under the NRB Act, the existing 10 per cent ceiling
on interest rates was repealed as of 1 July 1989. The Government announced
that as of that date, it proposed to encourage the emergence of a fully market-
determined interest rate structure. As an interim move in that direction,
Interest rates up to a maximum of 13.5 per cent could be charged. TDB has
subsequently adopted an interest rate structure fully reflective of the
Government's new policy.
B. Characteristics of Subloans
12.      The third Bank loan to TDB was utild to finance a total of 376
subloans. Of these, three subloans for $0.297 million were above-the-free limit
of $40,000 while the remaining subloans, for $0.867 million, were below-the-free
limit. The main characteristics of subloans financed under the loan and the
pattern of their distribution by sector, size, geographic location, purpose and
maturity are shown in the Basic Data Sheet.
.X/ At the time of appraisal, the value of the Pa'anga was maintained at parity
with the Australian dollar.



-94 -
13.      As indicated in Table 1 below, the actual sectoral allocation varied
from the indicative allocation envisaged at the time of appraisal.
Table 1: Indicative and Actua Sectoral D2istribution
{Per cent)
Sector                           Indicative    Actual
Agriculture                       50.0         28.8
Industry and manufacturing        30.0          9.3
Services including trans-         20.0         61.9
portation and tourism
Total                            100I0         100.Q
14.      The relatively large proportion of subloans to the service sector was
due to the financing of relatively larger projects in transportation, tourism
including hotels and restaurants, and retail trading. The sectoral distribution
of subloans made from the Bank loan, however, is not reflective.of TDB's
distribution of overall approvals during FY1986 to FY1988, which were
distributed as follows: agriculture, 46 per cent; manufacturing, 13 per cent; and
cervices, 41 per cent. While agriculture continues to dominate TDB's lending
operations, the manufacturing sector continuous to be constrained by the limited
availability of domestice raw materials, and a shortage of local entrepreneurs and
technicians.
15.      Of the 376 subloans financed, 277 subloans (74 per cent) were in the
smallest size range (below T$2,000), totalling only $0.174 miUlion or 15 per cent
of the Loan amount. In contrast, three larger subloans, two of which were for
tourism subprojects and or.e of which was for manufacturing subproject,
accounted for $0.297 million or 26 per cent of the Loan amount. The average
size of subloans was $3,096, almost twice the average subloan sizes of $1,458 and
$1,708 under the first and second Bank loans, respectively.
16.      By location, about 97 per cent of the loan amount was allocated to
projects on Tongatapu and only 3 per cent to the outer islands. The relatively
high allocation of projects to Tongatapu, while reflecting the concentration oft
business activities on that island, also indicate the difficulties encountered by
TDB in terms of high costs and poor communications in servicing outer islands.
TDB has been making appropriate efforts to increase its lending to the outer
islands and has a branch office fn Vava'u island and representative office each
in Ha'apai, 'Eua and Niuas.
17.      The proceeds of the Loan were utilized mainly for expanding exidting
businesses. Only 30 of the 376 subloans financed new projects with the balance
(91 per cent of Loan proceeds) financing expansions. The maturity of subloans
ranged from 9 months to 10 years, with most of the subloans (26 per cent by
value) having maturities of less than two years. There was a preponderance of
small agricultural loans, the majority of which had maturities of up to three
years.



-95 -
C.  ImDlementation of Sub-raoiects
1.  Implemektation Status
18.      In view of the difficulty in obtaining data for such a large number
of small subloans, the Mission focussed its attention on evaluating the available
data on 56 subprojects involving subloans of more than $5,000 each, totalling
$0.829 million or about 71 per cent of the loan amount. Appendix 2 provides
details of the implementation status of these subloans. The actual aggregate
cost of these subprojects was T$3.173 million (*2.311 million), almost the same as
the estimates made by TDB at the time of appraisal. TDB financed 60 per cent
of the total project coat (of which 36 per cent was met by the Bank loan and 24
per cent from TDB's local currency - esources). Financing from other sources
(mainly the IDA credit) contributed about 15 per cent while the sponsors' share
accounted for about 25 per cent. Of the 56 subprojects, cost overruns totalling
T$5,000 were incurred by seven subprojects. Cost savings were achieved by
27 subprojects, mainly through non-utilization of the budgets for contingencies.
Twenty-two subprojects were implemented in accordance with cost estimates.
19.      Most subprojects involved the purchase of "off-the-shelf" plant and
equipment and, accordingly, most subprojects were implemented in a timely
manner.
20.      Procurement procedures applied by TDB were in accordance with the
Bank's guidelines and practices for South Pacific countries. Most of the
procurement was made on an 'off-the-shelf" basis. For larger commercial and
industrial subloans, reasonable competition was adopted. Considering the size
and nature of the subprojects, the procurement procedures applied were
appropriate. Details of procurement by country of origin are given in Appendix
3. New Zealand accounted for $0.667 milion (58 per cent) folowed by Japan for
$0.424 million (36 per cent) and Australia for $0.072 million (6 per cent).
D.  Initial OQeration of Subprojects
1.  Operational. Financial and Economic Performance of Subn rolects
21.      Data concerning the operational, financal and economic performance
of the subprojects exceeding $5,000 each are provided in Appendix 4. The
financial performance data available from TDB covered 53 subprojects for the
first year of their operation. Of these, three subprojects incurred losses, 37
operated less profitably than anticipated, and 13 earned higher profits than
estimated. Similarly, data on 49 subprojects were available for second year
operations. Of these, 11 operated at a loss, 24 operated less profitably than
anticipated, and 14 subprojects earned profits higher than expected.
22.      During the first year of operations, four subprojects made returns
of more than 20 per cent on average equity, 28 earned between 10 per cent and
20 per cent, and 18 subprojects earned less than 10 per cent. Similarly, during
the second year of operations, 10 subprojects earned more than 20 per cent on
average equity, 22 earned between 10 per cent and 20 per cent, and 6
subprojects earned less than 10 per cent. This shortfall in the financial



96
performance of some subiprojects was mainly caused by inadequate supply of
raw materials and spare parts, especially for those subprojects located in the
outer islands.
23.      The socio-economic impact of subprojects, measured by foreign
exchange earnings/savings, incremental employment and investment cost per job
was considered satisfactory. Annual foreign exchange earnings or savings
attributed to the 13 subprojects which reported such data totalled T$0.285
million in their first year of operation. The 54 subprojects for which data are
available generated 176 additional Jobs, at an average investment cost per job
of T$11,070.
24.      In addition, certain non-quantifiable socioeconomic benefits have
been generated by the subprojects. First, the Bank-financed agricultural
subloans have helped Increase food production with a resultant increase in
employment and farmers' income; second, the assistance to transport services
has contributed towards faster delivery of farm produce to market; and third,
the Bank loan helped mobilized local funds for development purposes. Each
Tongan pa'anga equivalent provided under the Bank Loan was supplemented by
local investment funds of T$1.37.
2. Current Status of SubDrojects
25.      Of the 56 subprojects of more than $5,000 each, 11 subloans were
fully repaid as of 31 May 1989, while 45, totalling T$1.322 million ($1.017 million)
were outstanding (see Appendix 5). Of the outstanding subloans, repayments
of 24 subloans were on schedule, 20 were in arrears of up to six months and one
was overdue for more than six months. Total arrears were T$68,927 ($53,020) or
5.2 per cent of total amount outstanding. The quality of the subloan portfolio
financed under the BiLnk loan compares favorably to TDB's general loan
portfolio.
E.  Operational Performance of TDB
1.  Organization. Management and Staffing
26.      TDB's major policy-making and governing body Is Its Board of
Directors. The Board consists of eight members, of whom seven are appointed
by the Government (including the Managing Director), and one by BOT. The
Board meets at least monthly to set policies and to consider loan applications of
T$40,000 or more. TDB's organizational structure (see Appendix 6) is considered
appropriate for smooth and effective operations. The Bank technical assistance
(No. 777-TON) to review TDB's personnel management policies and procedures
has resulted in organizational improvements. These improvements were: (i) the
bifurcation of the Deputy Managing Director's (DMD) responsibilities into two
positions (Ie. DMD for Operations and DMD for Finance and Economic
Development); (ii) the creation of two separate units for Economics and Research
and Staff Training; and (iii) reporting of branch offices to the Head Office on
functional lines. The positions of DMD for Finance and Economic Development



-97-
and the heads of Economic and Research and Staff Training are currently
occupied by expatriates 1/ who are working with appropriately qualified local
counterparts.
27.     *TDE's total staff increased from 88 (including 32 professionals) at 31
December 1985 to 95 (including 55 professionals) at 31 December 1988. This
movement reflects an appropriate reduction in the numbers of clerical and other
supporting staff during the period, largely as a result of closer management
control of employment of such staff and also reflecting the effects of
computerization of TDB's accounting system. The increase in professional staff
members over the period primarily reflects increased staff located in TDB's
Vava'u branch and representative offices in the outer islands. The Consultant
under the Bank's technical assistance (No. 777-TON) produced manuals on staff
recruitment and performance appraisal that have strengthened TDB's personnel
administration policies and procedures.
28.      With the creation of the Staff Training Unit, staff training is being
undertaken in a more organized and planned manner. The Unit has, since the
beginning of 1988, conducted a total of 37 in-house training courses on various
aspects of development banking. In addition, the Unit has conducted regular
training needs surveys and has introduced personnel planning procedures.
2.  Lending Olerations
a) Loan Qperations
29.      A detailed analysis of TDB's lending during 1986 to 1988 by sector,
t3e of borrower. geographic location, size and maturity of lean in prvi ded in
Appendix 7. During the period 1986 to 1988, TDB's lending increased at an
annual compounded growth rate of 43.3 per cent. This growth was fairly evenly
distributed between the agriculture, industrial and service sectors. Agriculture
loans, principally for financing root crops, vanilla, fruit and vegetable
production accounted for 45.5 per cent of the total lending during the three-
year period. Services and tourism related activities accounted for 39.8 per cent
of the total lending and manufacturing accounted for 12.9 per cent. Most of
TDB's clients are repeat borrowers who, during the period, accounted for 69 per
cent of all borrowers. TDB's lending has been concentrated on the main island
of Tongatapu, which accounted for 85 per cent of the total approvals. The
majority of TDB's approvals remained in the range of T$1,000 and below which
totalled 7,793 loans or 81.2 per cent of the total number of loans approved
during 1986 to 1988. The distribution of loans by maturity shows that loans of
less than two years received the largest share of TDB's total lending during the
period, accounting for 39.2 per cent.

Austraian Staffing Assistance Scheme (ASAS), while the other two are
provided by the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation (CFTC).

b) Project APn3raisal and Sunervision Procedures
30.      TDB's procedures for loan processing, documentation, procurement,
disbursement and supervision have been generaUy satisfactory. TDB's loan
appraisal procedures in particular have benefitted from the technical assistance
provided since TDB's establishment by the Bank and other agencies. The
economic evaluation of loans of T$10,000 and above has improved and greater
attention is now being provided to the analysis of financial and marketing
aspects of subprojects.
F. Financial Performance of TD8
1.  Size and Quality of Portfolio
31.      TDB's loan portfolio has increased in line with its lending operations
from T$8.04 million in 1986 to T$16.06 million in 1988, an annual compounded
growth rate of 41.3 per cent. TDB's equity investment portfolio remains
negligible, representing only 0.2 per cent of the total portfolio.
32.      The quality of. TDB's loan portfolio has remained  generally
satisfactory. Total arrears rose from T$0.75 million in 1986 to T$1.06 million in
1988. Similarly, hard-core arrears (overdues of more than 12 months and cases
under legal action) increased from T$0.33 million in 1986 to T$O.48 million in 1988.
However, in ratio terms, TDB's total arrears to total loans outstanding showed
an improvement from 9.3 per cent in 1986 and 1987 to 6.6 per cent in 1988.
While hard-core arrears also improved from 4.1 per cent in 1986 to 3.0 per cent
in 1988, TDB has not been able to comply with the limit covenanted under the
Loan that such arrears should drop to 3.0 per cent (by 1986) and 2.0 per cent
(by 1987). The cash collection ratios of 68.5 per cent in 1987 and 72.2 per cent
in 1988 were short of the Bank's loan covenant which requires TDB to achieve
a cash collection ratio of at least 75 per cent by 31 December 1987 and for
subsequent years. Impediments to achieving the covenanted ratios as at 31
December 1988 stem mainly from late payment of two large working capital
advances for export of Tonga's vanilla crop. The Mission noted that TDB is
undertaking appropriate actions to achieve compliance with these covenants.
As at 31 May 1989, TDB's annual collection ratio Improved to 74.3 per cent while
its hard-core arrears ratio was reduced to 2.5 per cent. TDB's provision for
bad and doubtful debts has also increased significantly, and at 31 December
1988, was equivalent to 6 per cent of total loan portfolio. The adequacy of these
provisions has been certified by TDB's independent auditors. An analysis of
TDB's arrears and collection performance is given in Appendixes 8 and 9,
respectively.
2.  Financial Statements and Ratios
33.      TDB's projected and actual balance sheets, Income statements and
cash flow statements for the period 1986-1988 are provided In Appendixes iO,
11 and 12. During this period, TDB's total assets increased at an average annual
rate of 34 per cent, compared with the 5 per cent projected. Most of this
increase was due to the expansion of the loan portfolio.



-99-
34.      Although TDB's long-term debts increased (in order to finance an
increased lending volume) at a rate faster than its share capital (43 per cent as
against 20 per cent), its debt/equity ratio as at 31 December 1988 was 1.7:1,
below the ceiling of 3:1 prescribed by the Bank.
36.      TDB has maintained marginally acceptable profitability during the
period with the 1988 return on average equity of 1.7 per cent being the highest
achieved to date. The high ratio of administration expenses to average portfolio
(6.1 per cent in 1988) is the major cause of this low protitability. The need to
maintain relatively high staff members to administer the large number of Small
loans and the wide geographic spread of TDB's client base are factors
contributing directly to TDB's high cost structure. The ability of TDB's
management to address these factors is limited because of the Government's
requirement that TDB should provide "social sector"nI lending.
36.      Other aspects of TDB's financial performance have been satisfactory.
0. Covenants
37.      Details of the loan covenants and their compliance status are given
in Appendix 13. The Bank loan covenants have been substantially compUed with,
with the exception of the covenants requiring maintenance of a minimum
collection ratio and a maximum hard-core arrears ratio (see pea. 32).
R. Bank's Performance
38.      The third Bank loan was declared effective on 2 October 1986, within
the 90-day limit set for this purpose and was fully utilisd ahead of the original
closing dates. The Bank's turn around time for processing of below the free
limit subloan applications averaged four days and for above free limit subloans
was about three weeks including the time taken in seeking clarification and
additional information. This turn around time for the third Bank loan was a
significant improvement over the performance in respect of the second Bank
loan, which averaged 27 days.
39.      The Bank has made adequate efforts to review TDB's operations
through annual review and other missions. The scope of these missions and
quality of their reports have been satisfactor. In addition, the Bank was
successful in recruiting Consultants under the piggy-backed technical
assistance who achieved a high degree of success In meeting their terms of
reference in a timely manner.
1/ Loans of less than T$2,500 provided in support of family-based subsistence
agriculture, village-level service activities and other social support
activities.

III. EVALUATION OF APPRA1SAL AND IMPLE]MENTATION
A. _Loan Appaidsal
1.  Covenants
40.      The covenants included in the loan dc-,uments were generally well-
conceived and appropriate in the circumstances prevailing at the time of
appraisal. In particular, the covenants requiring minimum annual collection
ratios and maximum hard-core arrears ratios encouraged TDB's management to
pay particular attention to the quality of TDB's loan portfolio. While these
covenants were not fully complied with, the extent of non-compliance was
marginal as at 31 May 1989, reflecting a significant improvement in TDB's arrears
situation since the time of appraisal. In retrospect, the maximum hard-core
arrears ratio covenant was set at an unrealistically high level. The Mission
considers that the maintenance of TDB's hard-core arrears at 2.5 per cent of
portfolio instead of the 2.0 per cent covenanted would not unduly detract from
TDB's financial position. A minimum return on net-worth covenant, which was
not included In the loan documents, might have promoted closer control of TDB's
administration expenses. While the ratio of administration expenses to total
portfolio value declined slightly from 6.5 per cent to 6.1 per cent between 1986
and 1988 and was less than projected, the annual expenditure on such expenses
had increased by 65 per cent during the period. As a result, TDB did not
benefit from the potential economies of scale that might have been expected
from a near-doubling of loan portfolio value during the period. A covenant
requiring TDB to adopt an operating strategy for the 1987 to 1990 period
specifying profit objectives was complied with. However, TDB has delayed the
implementation of this strategy while it awaits the drafting of a new Financial
Institutions Act that the Government is currently preparing. Until this Act is
finalized, TDB is prevented from adopting a diversification strategy that would
have the primary objectives of increasing TDB's domestic resource mobilization
and improving its profitability.
2.  Technical Assistanct
41.      The Project provided appropriate technical assistance that has
resulted in the substantial strengthening of TDB's institutional capabilities,
particularly as a result of the computerization of the accounting system. This
computerization has enabled TDB's management to obtain more accurate and
timely information on the status of TDB's finances and portfolio quality and has
enabled a substantial increase in portfolio size to take place without an increase
in supporting staff numbers.
3.  Quality of ADDraisal
42.      The appraisal mission's projections of TDB's operations were
conservative and did not anticipate the rapid increase in lending levels,
especially in the services sector, that occurred during 1987-1988. However, the
appraisal mission's observations and suggestions for improvement in appraisal
standards, supervision procedures, personnel management policies and financial
position were appropriate.  In general, the Mission considers that the
formulation of the Project and the quality of appraisal were satisfactory.



- 101 -
IL  ISplmenla&2n
43.      The implementation of both the third Bank loan to TDB and of the
subprojects; financed thereunder have been generally satisfactory.  TDB's
evaluation of subprojects has improved over its performance under the earlier
Bank loans. However, the Mission is of the view that scope stil exists for TDB
to further improve its procedures for monitoring the financial and economic
performance of subprojects.  Technical assistance provided by CFTC is
currently implementing improved procedures for this purpose as well as
providing. assistance to TDB's program of sector studies.



-102 -
IV. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
44.      The PCR Mission concludes that the utilzation of the Bank Loan hag1
on the whole, been satisfactory, and the loan his achieved its purpose of
extending assistance to specific development projects in the agricultural,
industrial and services sectors in the Kingdom. The accompanying technical
assistance has resulted in significant strengthening of TDB's institutional
capabilities. TDB has made substantial progress in establishing itself as a major
source of term credit and has contributed significantly to economic development
In Tonga.
46.      TDB's operations have expanded considerably during the period of
utilization of the Bank Loan and TDB's management expects this expansion to
continue during the next few years. While the Mission considers that TDB's
current manasemerit, staffing and organization are of sufficient strength for
TDB to continue to maintain appropriate operational standards, it also considers
that further institutional strengthening should be considered to ensure that
adequate control is maintained over TDB's quality of lending, portfolio
administration and profitability.
46.      The Mission considers that acceptance and implementation of the
folowing recommendations would strengthen TDB's capabilities to provide an
appropriate and development-oriented channel for Bank funds.
i)   Prtoi Revoiew
47.      The rapid increase in portfolio value during 1986 to 1988 reflects an
increase in average loan size for TDB and more rapid processing of loan
applications. In order to provide a verification of the appropriateness of TDB's
loan appraisal and supervision procedures and capabilities, a detailed portfolio
review should be undertaken. Such a review should have the primary objective
of identifying potential problems within TDB's loan portfolio, providing an
appropriate classification of the portfolio according to the quality of loans,
providing an ex-poste review of appraisal standards and a verification of the
adequacy of TDB's provision for doubtful debts.
ii)   rnternal Audit
48       Reflecting the importance of internal audit functions to assist TDB's
senior managemeot in overseeing TDB's operations, additional qualified staff
have been sought for the staffing of the Internal Audit Unit. The Mission
recommends that the rectuitment of such staff should be afforded a high
priority. In addition, an appropriate expert should be recruited to prepare an
Internal audit manual to guide the work of the Unit.
iiI)    Accounting System and Procedure.
49.      The computerization of TDB's accounting system has removed a major
bottleneck within TDB's administrative functions. To ensure that maximum
advantage is taken of the computerized accounting system, TDB should further
develop the system to provide increased flexibility for the charging of interest,



- 103 -
the classification of portfolios, the recording of interest Income and the
disaggregation of loans to individual borrowers. An updated accounting manual
should be prepared to fully reflect the operation of the accounting system and
TDB's policy of reporting income on a full-accrual bahis should be modified to
provide a more prudent accounting of income earned from problem loans.
iv)    2iversilction of Activ-itles
50.      In order to address the problem of continuing low profitability, TDB
should utilize, as soon as possible, technical assistance offered by the Austraian
Government for a study of TDB's diversification options.
v)    sAMU Training
51.      TDB has established a staff training unit which is now well advanced
in identifying and meeting the training needs of TDB*s middle-level and lower-
level staff. However, internal staff-training activities will not be sufficient to
meet the advanced training requirements for these staff who are expected to
develop as TDB's future senior management or to prepare the existing managers
for a diversification of TDB's activities. TDB should therefore carefully identify
these particular training needs and identify external training activities that
would satisfy them.
vi)    "Miko" Lending
52.      In order to promote the Government's social development objectives,
TDB provides relatively low-cost loans of less than T$1,000 for specified
activities including subsistence agriculture and fishing. Such lending is
expensive to undertake and TDB's costs ar not fully covered by the interest
Income received. In order to provide an appropriate basis for: reviewing, with
the Government, TDB's policies and procedures for such lending; seeking means
of providing such lending at lower cost; and evaluating the various means of
reducing the implicit subsidization of such lending, it is recommended that TDB
review its 'micro" lending activities. The review should provide an estimate of
the annual net cost to TDB of such lending and Identify alternative mechanisms
for such "micro" lending.

development in the fields of agriculture including horticulture, livescock
and fishing; timber extraction and reforestation; quarrying, industry,
manufacture and processing of all kinds; tourism; commerce; transport and
communication; and service industries Including professions.
4. The Bank will finance both new  enterprises and the expansion or
modernization of existing enterprises (the work "enterprise" as used in this
Policy Statement having the same meaning as is defined in the Tonga
Development Bank Act 1977 and includes cooperatives and community
activities). Particular attention will be given to promotion of the entry of
new entrepreneurs into the field of productive endeavour and the
development of managerial and entrepreneurial skils.

6. The Bank's financial assistance wiU be primarily for the acquisition of fixed
assets. However, the Bank may in deserving cases also finance seasonal and
short-term credit requirements in the agricultural sector as well as working
capital requirements in any sector.
C.  Development Policies and Oferating Princgiles
7. It will be one of the Bank's important aims to investigate and identify
investment opportunities, and to promote and assist in the establishment of
enterprises of importance to the. economy.
8. In addition to the operating principles mentioned under Section 6 of the
Development Bank Act 1977, the Bank will also give preference, in
determining whether or not assistance is to be given to any enterprise, to
enterprises which will:-
(a) use local raw materials in processing and manufacture;
(b) make use of labor intensive technologies and provide more opportunities
for employment and training of local people;
(c) contribute effectively to broadening the base of local entrepreneurship
and ownership;

feasible, financially viable and profitable. Special attention will be given to
the quality of management of the enterprise and to the market prospects of
the project.
11. The Bank will endeavour to secure its loans and guarantees in accordance
with sound banking practices, but in doing so the Bank will have due regard
to Its functional requirement to promote the economy for the economic and
social advancement of the people of Tonga.
12. Applicants will be required to proide a reasonable equity in the enterprise
to ensure that they have an appropriate stake in their own venture. They
will also have to ensure that the total financial requirement for the
successful implementation of the project will be available.

AP2endix 1
Page 3
13. The Bank will ensure, in making its financial assistance available to any
borrower, that the financial requirement for the completion and commissioning
of the project is appropriately covered, including due allowance for possible
cost overruns.
14. Normally, loans will be disbursed after the promoter has made his own
financial contribution to the project and after ensuring that such
disbursement is in accord with the requirements of the financial plan
approved for the project.
15. The repayment period of a loan made by the Bank, including a grace period
as appropriate and needed, will be determined taking into account;
(a) the repayment capacity of the enterprise;
(b) a reasonable payout to the promoter during the term of the loan; and
(c) the optimum use of the Bank's own funds in maximizing the turnover
of its portfolio.

clients wiU be treated as confidential.
D.  Diversification of Portfolio
21. In order to reduce the concentration of risk, the Bank will seek to diversify
its portfolio by sectors of operation and by avoiding inappropriately large
investment in any one project. In view of its developmental function, the
Bank will also pursue geographical diversification of its portfolio.

The Bank's equity investment shall not normally exceed 25 per ce. of the
paid in capital of the assisted enterprise.
23. The Bank will not normally commit to a single e nterprise in the form of equity

Bank's own investment.
25. In exceptional cases meriting special consideration, limits under Clause 24 (b)
may be exceeded provided the loan is covered by adequate additional
security over assets not forming part of the project.
26. In financing worthwhile projects requiring more than its maximum lending
limits under Clause 24, the Bank may seek a syndicated cooperation of other
institutions, both domestic and foreign, lmiting the Bank's liability in such
cases to the ceiling referred to under such Clause.
E.  Financial Guidelines
27. The Bank will review and determine from time to time the rate of interest
and fees to be applied to its advances in the light of prevailing Government

costs of its own borrowings.
28. The Bank will not carry the exchange risk on its debts payable in foreign
currency.
29. The Bank will not seek to take a controlling interest or management of any
enterprise in which It has invested, other than by representation on the
board of directors (or similar committee) In appropriate cases. However,
should it become necessary to protect its own Interest, the Bank may take
such action as it considers appropriate in the circumstances.
30. The Bank will not undertake long-term borrowing obligations, including
guarantees, that in the aggregate would exceed three times the total of its

FUI DEVELOPMET BANK PROJECT
(LOAN 2598-FIJ)
PRI:ACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Fiji Development Bank (PDB)
Project for which Loan 2598-FU in the amount of US$6.S million was signed on October 10,
1985. The original Loan Closing Date was December 31, 1989; however, the loan account was
acally closed on November 3, 1988, following a request from the Govemment of Fiji, and an
undisbursed balance of US$5,317,146.77 was cancelled. In 1989, after receiving the IBRD's
agreement to waive the prepayment premium, the Government of Fiji prepaid the outanding
loan balance.
The PCR was prepared by staff of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), with whom
IBRD cofnanced the Project, following a project completion mission to Fiji June 10-20, 1990.
Under an agreement between the IBRD and the ADB, the ADB was responsible for oveal
project formulation and appraisal, and for subsequent supervision of project implementation.
The PCR is accompanied by an Evaluation Summary prepared by IBRD staff.

11. Background
3.         Consistent with the IBRD's strategy of focusing on rural development, including
rural infastructure, the project was also in line with the Govermnent's strategy of fostering the
development of altenative crops and associated agro-industries in order to raise the level of
investment and economic growth (specifically, to diversify the structure of the economy, which
depended heavily on sugar). The Bank's involvement in the project, and in the agricultural
portfolio in particular, would allow FDB to increase credit available to smaller-scale farmers.
4.         The FDB was estblished on July 1, 1967, under the FDB Act of 1966, as a
Government-owned, autonomous institution with its own Board of Directors. It is the only
development financing institution in the country providing long-term financing of projects
(mainly in the private sector) in agriculture (ncluding fisheries), industry, mining and to the
service sectors including trsport, communications and tourism.
m. Project Objectives and Description
S.         The objectives of this cofinanced project were: (i) to support the institution-
building efforts with respect to FDB as recommended by an ADB technical assistance mission
in 1983; (ii) to transfer capital and technical support for industry (particularly agro-processing),
griculture and related service activities; and (iii) to improve the efficiency and orientation of
sected publicly-owned enteprises.
6.         The IBRD Loan was in the amount of US$6.5 million, of which US$3.5 million
was m cofinancing with a US$7.0 million ADB Loan under the same terms and conditions. The
balance of US$3.0 million was to be used by the Government for making fither equity
injections to FDB with these funds specifically earmarked for FDB's agricultural lending
operations. The cofinanced portion of IBRD loan was to be udlized with the ADB loan on a
33:67 pro rata disbument basis for subloans financed under the project.
IV. Project Design and Implementation
7.         The project was preqared by ADB and FDB, and was appraised by ADBJIBRD in
January-February 1985. Negotiatons were held in Manila from April 24 to 26, 1985. FDB's
Statement of Operating Strategy and General Business Policy- emphasizes the developmental
role of FDB in: providing financing and equity participation in agriculturd and industria
epris; contributing to the Government's planning processes; developing new financing
schemes; and providing business management counsel.
8.         At the time of appraisal, FDB's instittional and operational aspects were found
satisfactory; its wanagement and staff were qualified and competent. Although its profitability
had slightly deteriorated since FY1983/84 (following increases in the cost of its borrowings from
the local financial market), FDB maiained a sound financial position. The quality of its
portfolio was found to be generaly satisfactory; afrears were at a manageable level and were
deemed adequately covered by its provision for bad debt.
9.         The Appraisal Mission concluded that the FDB was a suitable agency for channeling
ADBIIBRD funds to private enterprises in Fiji, and that it was capable of processing and



- 129 -
superviing both loans and equit Investments. In addition to the standard loan covenants, FDB
agreed to the following: O) a maximum debtlequity ratio of 3:1; (i) a minimum debt-service
coverage ratio of 1.25 times; (Ili) a minimum ret  (before provisions) on its average equity
of 6 percent per annum; (v) an annual review of its interest rate stucure; and (v) recruitment
of a qualified engineer by December 1985.
10.        Project risks identified at appraisa  related to the lack of itational
competitveness of most Fijian eepries In tm of pricing, product design and quality. ibis
problem was due largely to the small size of the local market, extreme distances from major
export markets, the lack of trained personnel, and the underdevelopment of local industries
supplying components and intermediate inputs. Industries based on agriculture and forestry were
considered to have comparative advantages.
II.        By May 1987 (eleven months after loan effectiveness), both commitmes and
disbursements were well behind the appraisa estimates. The major causes attributed to this lag
included: (i) FDB's utilization, to the exclusion of ADB/JBRD fiuds, of a low itferest credit
line from the European Invetmet Bank (BIB) at 6.4 percet  terest compared to the fixed
intrest rate of 9.65 percen on IBRD/ADB funds; (u) market lending rates were lower than
toe charged under the Bank Loan Alhough the interest rate charged to FDB under the Bank
Loa  compared favorably to the cost of funds raised through bond issue denominaed in Fiji
during 1985 to 1987, FDB was concned that exchange rate movement would result in the
Bank funds becoming relatively expensive.ZI Subsequent to 1987 the fieancial system in Fiji
became relatively liquid and FDB was able to raise funds through bond issues at interest rates
significantly less than those charged on the Bank Loan; and (iii) FDB did not normally prepare
comprehensive loan appraisal reports that the Bank required for above free-limit subloans.
Therefore, utilization of the Bank fimds to finance larger subprojects was not attractive to FDB
as such udlization would have involved significant aditi    work in preparing subloan appr
reports to meet the Bank's requirements (also refer paras. 13 and 14 of the ADB's PCR). After
May 1987, cv dsturces In Fiji shaply reduced investment demand and the prospects for
significant new commitments under the credit line for new long-term projects were discouraging.
By March 1988, FDB bad committed only US$0.83 million of IBRD funds.
12.        FDB's financia performa    was declining. As of end-December 1987, FDB, with
a return of 5.1 percent (efore provisions) on average net worth, was not in compliance with the
legal covenant specifying that it should maintain at least a 6 percent return (the FY88 return was
projected to improve to 5.8 percent, sil below the coveanted 6 percent). In addition, FDB's
arrears position had deteriorated, from 8.4 percent of total loan portfolio as of December 1984,
to 12.8 percent as of end 1987. Moreover, FDB faced two potent threats: (I) if the economic
downturn persisted, FDB's loan portfolio could conte to deteriorate; and (U) political
uncertainty and poor economic peformance miht smate prures on FDB to accept behestu
lending projects. In additon, FDB's own equity Investment operations were relatively inactive
and supplementary financing was not required (refer para. 27 of the ADB's PCR).
2/  Me Govenimet lad asumed the fomtpg exchnge risk on te Loa   However, given the nnn-
concesioay nature of dt interest rafe charged, TDB's Management was reuctant to incur suh
risk for the Government



- 130 -
13.       Considering the unfavorable invesment climate and economic downtu  that Fiji
was experiencing, there was little that FDB could do in the short term to improve its
profitabflity. As a resut of these concerns and the fact that the ADB/ABRD funds could not be
used profitably, the Goverment requested, in November 1988, cancellation of both the
undisbursed ADB and the IBRD credit lines.
V. Project Results and Institutional Sustainablilty
14.       At the request of the Government, for reasons discussed above, US$5.3 million
(almost 82 percent) of the IBRD loan was cancelled in November 1988. A total of 51 subloans
were financed under the Project. Of these, only five sabloans were above the free-limit of
US$80,000. A detailed breakdown of these subloans by sector, size, geographical location,
purpose and mafity is given in the Part I (Basic Data) C. (Implementatio Data) of the ADB's
PCR. Due to largely unavailable information on these subprojects, a closer ament of the
ecnomic Impact and financl performance of the subprojects could not be made (refr parm.
23, 24, 25 and 48 of the ADB's PCR). Data on equty disbuement  not available.
15.       In terms of instiutiona performance during the three-year project implemention
period, the FDB experienced increasing arrears, a drop in collection performance and lower-than
anticipated profitability. However, the ADB's PCR mission concluded ta, overall, the FDB's
financiaW performance had been satisfactory, and during this period the FDB Management had
taken adequate action such that a deteriorati situation was controlled in a tmely mne (refer
paras. 34-41 of the ADB's PCR). Another important institutional issue concerns FDB's staffing.
Before the polit   events of May 1987, FDB had equte qualified and experienced staff.
However, a large number of professional staff resigned thereafter. Many of these resignations
were due to emigration, while others moved to senior positions in the public service sad
financial sectors within the Country. Mmis staff change resulted in an inetable detedoration in
the levels of skill and expeience of the FDB staff (refer para. 31 of the ADBs PCR) and with
it a weakening in the performance of FDB.
VL        P formance
16.       The IBRD's direct involvement in this project was more than customary for projects
cofinanced with ADB-ik participated in both project appraisa and field supervision. In respone
to the low utilization of the IBRD/ADB fimds, the Bank agreed to the finmcing of perma
working capita and to an expanded definiton of digible entpdses under the agriciutua credit
component However, these meares had no sgnificant Impact on incasing the level of funds
utilization. The Bank's involvement, especialy in consultation with senior govenmnent officials
during project implementation, helped to clarify their views as to whether they should continue
exending IBRD/ADB credits. However, it is unlikely that even if the ADB and IBRD had
played a more active and direct role, the outcome of the project could have been much altered.
Both the lack of demand for project funds and the FDB's declining performance were influenced
predominanly by economic developments after the political events of May 1987.
VIL Lssons Learned
17.       The fact that only 18 percent of loan proceeds were utilzed can be attribtd to
economic factors unfeeen at the time of appraisal; specifically, depresed investm  demand



- 131 -
that followed the political evens of mid-1987, compunded by FDB's subsequent accs to
lower-cost funds from the EIB, and the domestic financal market, mang the Bank loan
proceeds noncompetitive. While such politial and ensuing economic developments were
difficult to identify at the time of appraisal, it appears that more thorugh assesment of the
implications of FDB's likely access to concessionary fnding woud have led to a resent
of the timing of the loan. Even a relatively short delay would have demonsatd that the
demand for term financing in Fiji could have been met from the BIB loan and that the Bank was
not in a position to compete.
18.       While instittional streamlining was among the project objectives, the project did
not include specific action programs which would have helped improve FDB's asset management
and credit evaluation/loan processing procedures, thus no contrbution was made to improve
FDB's financW performace. Even if specific measures to seek such an improvement were
included in the project design, above mentioned extena circmstn   would have made them
inffectve.

Thank you for your fax message of January 6 and the attached copies of your
Project Completion Reports for Credit 1813-TON and Loan 2598-FUI.
We have reviewed the two documents and find them to be in accordance with
our views and analysis and therefore have no significant comments to offer. One
minor comment we, would make refers to para 2.2 of the lDB document wherein an
"actual negative spread" on TDB's overall lending operations is referred to. In fact
TDB has always 4,hievrd a positive interest spread on its lending operations.
We offer somewhat belated best wishes for 1993 and look forward to working
with you again during the year.
Best wishes,
Yours sincerely,

I.  BACKCROUND
1.        Fiji Development Bank (FDB) was established on 1 July 1967 under
the Fiji Development Bank Act as an autonomous statutory body with its own
Board of Directors. Although FDB is empowered to provide a full range of
banking services, it is subject neither to the provisions of Fiji's
Banking Act or Companies Act, nor is it subject to the regulatory controls
of the Reserve Bank of Fiji. FDB's authorized capital is F$50 million of
which F$38.8 million had been issued to and fully paid-up by the
Government as at 31 December 1989.
2.        The Government has utilized FDB as a key instrument of economic
development through its promotion and financing of, mainly private sector,
enterprises contributing to the diversification and growth of the Fijian
economy. Accordingly, FDB enjoys the full support of the Government.
Apart from providing FDB's equity capital, the Government assists FDB to
mobilize resources from both foreign and domestic sources through
provision of guarantees, foreign exchange risk cover and provision of
special status to bonds issued by FDB, thus increasing their
attractiveness to Fijian investors.
3.        The Bank has actively supported FDB's institutional development
through the provision of five separate technical assistance projects
during the period 1970 to 1989. The first three projects funded the cost
of expatriate experts who held advisory positions during the initial
periods of FDB's staff development programs. The fourth project provided
for a review of the role and function of FDB. The fifth project currently
being implemented is designed to strengthen FDB's staff training
capabilities following rapid staff turnover during 1988 and 1989 (see para
31). The Bank has provided one earlier line-of-credit Project for $2
million. 1/
B.   Scole of Onerations
4.        Fiji Development Bank's basic functions are to facilitate and
stimulate  the  promotion  and  development  of  natural  resources,
transportation and other industries within Fiji.   To enable  it to
undertake these functions, FDB has been authorized to provide loans; issue
guarantees; underwrite loans and issues of capital; subscribe for shares,
bonds and debentures; establish and manage projects; develop real estate
for sale or lease; and provide advice and extension services to industrial
and other enterprises. The major focus of FDB's activities has, however,
been the provision of term loans and equity investments for financing of
investment projects. As a multi-sectoral development finance institution
(DFI), FDB finances projects in the agriculture, fisheries, mining,
manufacturing, transport, communications and tourism sectors. FDB has
contributed actively to the development of a capital miarket in Fiji. In
particular, FDB has established a merchant banking subsidiary (Merchant
/ Loan No. 174-FIJ (OCR), approved 21 December 1973.



-148 -
Bank of Fij3 Limited), a funds anagoemnt subsidiary (FDB Nominees
Limited) and Suva Stock Exchange LAlmted, thus providing an institutional
infrastructure for capital market development.
C.      ationshi   th the 
5.       The relatlonshlp between FDB and the Bank has never been
particularly close and the Bank's two loan projects to FDB have
contributed only a mall proportion of FDB's total fundlng. At 30 June
1988, the outstanding balance of the Bank's loans represented only 1.6
percent of FDB's outstanding term liabilitles. FOD has also recelved two
lines-of-credit from the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD), the second of wbich co-financed the subject Loan. The
European Coamunity, Europoan Invostmnt Bank (EIB) and Commonwealth
Development Corporation (CDC) have all provided funds to FDB. FDB' s total
borrowings from these three lenders represented 11.4 percent of total term
liabillties at 30 June 1989, by which date all borrowiig from the Bank had
been repaid.
6.        SIB and CDC have generally provided funds at lower cost and with
less conditionality than the Bank, thus making them more attractive
lenders. On the other hand, FDB has preferred to receive Bank technical
assistance for institution building purposes as consultants fielded under
technical asslatance from the Bank have generally provided valuable
contributions to FDB's development.    PDB, through lts government-
supported bond issues, has been able to obtain the bulk of its resources
at reasonable cost and on attractive terms from local sources.
Accordingly FDB has followed a funding policy oriented toward domestLc
resources. The Bank is only likely to be a future source of funds for FDB
if unexpected developments in local financial markets result in a change
in such policies.  Regular contact is maintained between FDB and the
Bank's South Pacific Regioal Office (81PO) in order that the Bank can
remain in touch with FDB's status and prospective funding and technical
assistance needs.
D.  Rational fgr tdo ANk L
7.       The Bank Loan was provlded following the completion of TA No.
506-FIJ in July 1983. This technical assistance had provided an intensive
review of the role end function of FDB with a view to enabling FDB to play
a  more  active  role  ia  economic  development.    The  Consultants'
recommendations on the rLorganizatiou of FDB and for the amndment of
FDB's Policy statesmet were subquently fully accepted and implemented
by the Government and IDS.
8.       The review of FDA's role and function undertaken under the
technical assLstane was prompted partly by the negative growth
experienced by Fiji's economy durLig 1982 and early 1983. This negative
growth resulted primarily from poor performnc  of tho sugar and tourlsm
sectors due to the provailing world-wide recession combined with cyclones
and a drought. The Government's response to-this situation was to pursue



-149 -
diversification and acceleration of growth of the economy in order to
lessen Fiji's reliance on sugar and tourism. The Government defined a key
role for FDB in implementing its economic development programs. As the
only DFI in Fiji, FDB was and remains the sole source of term finance for
private-sector development projects whose implementation would promote
diversification and more rapid growth of the economy.
9.        The Bank Loan and the Line of Equity (LE-3 FIJ) were intended
to provide support and additional funding for the increased focus within
FDB on the financing of industrial sector projects. These facilities were
also to support FDB's financing of private investment in service sector
projects related to economic diversification.
10.       The Bank Loan was co-financed by IBRD in an amount of $3.5
million.  The IBRD co-financing was to be from a $6.5 million IBRD loan
to the Government, of which $3.5 million was to be on-lent to FDB under
the same terms and conditions as the Bank Loan. The balance $3.0 million
of IBRD's loan to the Government was to be used by the Government for
making futther equity injections to FDB with these funds specifically ear-
matked for FDB's agricultural lending operations. The co-financed portion
of the IBRD loan was to be utilized on a 67:33 pro-rata disbursement basis
for subloans financed under the Project.
11.       The Bank loan and Line of Equity were expected to benefit about
150 projects in the industrial and service sectors and to generate an
additional 700 job opportunities.
11. IMPLEMNAIIQE
A.   Lendinf Policies
12.       Appendix 1 provides a copy of FDB's Statement of Operating
Strategy and General Business Policy. This document was revised in 1984
to reflect the recommendations of the Consultants provided under the
fourth Bank technical assistance project and has not been amended since.
The statement, which lays down FDB's scope of operations, general
policies, procedures, financial guidelines and policies regarding the
creation of provisions and reserves is considered satisfactory.   The
statement places an emphasis on the developmental role of FDB and provides
satisfactory guidelines for the maintenance of sound project financing and
related banking practices.
13.      . The guidelines have been generally adhered to by FDB although
the Project Completion Review (PCR) Mission found that a high proportion
of FDB's lending is not undertaken under a project-evaluation format.
Instead, a focus is placed on evaluation of debt-servicing capabilities
and availability of security when loan applications are reviewed. FDB,
therefore, follows an approach to its lending operations that is more akin

in some respects to that of a commercial bank than to that of a
conventional DnI. The Mission found this approach to be appropriate for
the relatively large number of smaller equipment financing and vehicle
loans provided by FDB. However, it was also an aspect that contributed
to the poor utilization of the Bank Loan. FDB does not normally prepare
the comprehensive loan appraisal documentation that the Bank requires with
submission of above-free-limit subloans.   Utilization of the loan for
financing of larger subprojects was, therefore, not attractive to FDB as
such utilization would have involved significant additional work in
preparing subloan appraisal reports to meet the Bank's requirements.
14.       An aspect of FDB's operations that also contributed to the poor
utilization of the Bank Loan was FDB's interest rate structure. Appendix
2 provides details of FDB's interest rate structure and prevailing
interest rates in Fiji during the period 1985 to 1989.   Although the
interest rate of 9.65 per cent charged to FDB under the Bank Loan compared
favorably during the period 1985 to 1987 to the cost of funds raised
through the issue of Fiji dollar denominated bonds, concern was voiced
within FDB that exchange-rate movements would result in the Bank funds
becoming relatively expensive.J/ Subsequent to 1987 the financial system
in Fiji became relatively liquid and FDB was able to raise funds through
further bond issues at interest rates significantly less than those
charged on the Bank Loan. Accordingly, utilization of the Bank Loan was
halted during 1988 and the outstanding balance of the loan was repaid
during the tbird quarter of 1989.
B.  Characteristics of Subloans
15.       The Bank Loan was utilized to finance a total of 51 subloans.
Of these, five subloans utilizing a total amount of $727,054 from the co-
financed Bank/IBRD Loanl/ were above the free limit of $80,000. The main
characteristics of subloans and the pattern of their distribution by
sector, size, geographic location, purpose and maturity are shown in the
Basic Data Sheet.
16.       The sectoral utilization of the Loan was consistent with
expectations at the time of appraisal with 67.3 per cent of disbursements
financing manufacturing sector subprojects. The recent rapid growth of
garment manufacture for export from Fiji is reflected in the relatively
high proportion (23.1 per cent) of loan proceeds disbursed to that sub-
sector.   The proportion of loan proceeds utilized for transport and
construction sector subprojects (18.9 per cent and 9.4 per cent) was
J/ The Government had assumed the foreign exchange risk on the Loan.
However, given the non-concessionary nature of the interest-rate
charged, FDB's Management was reluctant to incur such risk for the
Government.
2/  Each subloan was financed on a 67 per cent, 33 per cent basis from
the Bank and IBRD Loans. Subloan data in this Report refers to the
total disbursement from the co-financed Project.



- 151 -
relatively high.   However, this distribution was affected by the low
overall utilization of the Loan.   FDB Management explained that had a
higher proportion of the Loan been utilized, the additional commitments
would have been mainly for manufacturing subprojects.
17.       Below free limit subloans accounted for 90 per cent of subloans
by number reflecting FDB's preference for the simpler documentation
requirements of such subloan applications. However, 39.9 per cent of Loan
disbursements were to the five above free-limit subloans.   One large
subloan of F$388,700 to Rewa Co-operative Dairy Company accounted for 15.9
per cent of total disbursements.
16.       The subloans  financed were distributed evenly between  the
Central/Eastern and Western districts of the main island, Viti Levu. Only
seven subprojects on the less developed Vanua Levu were financed under the
Loan. Although a higher utilization of the Loan for subprojects on Vanua
Levu would have been preferred as this would have supported investment in
a less-developed region within Fiji, the difficulties of establishing
manufacturing based enterprises on Vanua Levu, which has an agricultural
economic base and less developed infrastructure, must be recognized.
19.       New as opposed to expansion/modernization subprojects accounted
for 33.6 per cent of the utilization of Loan proceeds. The PCR Mission
consider3 this to be a satisfactorily high proportion of the start-up
projects  that received funds under the Loan.   Many of these  new
subprojects were for the garment manufacture sector.
20.       Only 13 per cent of Loan proceeds were relent to sub-borrowers
for terms of ten years or more.  However, 53.2 per cent of total Loan
proceeds disbursed were relent for terms of over five years reflecting the
proportion of the Loan utilized for purchase of fixed assets other than
vehicles.  Subloans utilized for purchase of vehicles (mainly buses and
light trucks) were normally provided on three to five year repayment
terms, reflecting the economic life of such assets.
C. Imnlementation and Initial Oberation of Sub2roiecgs
1.   Imlmtatign Stats
21.       At the date of the PCR Mission in June 1990, all subprojects
financed under the Bank Loan had been fully implemented.   Of the 51
subprojects, six incurred cost overruns during the implementation stage
totalling F$563,500 and one subproject cost F$6,000 less than budgeted.
Most of the total amount of cost overrun resulted from a change in the
scope of the Rewa Co-operative Dairy Company subproject. Of the total
expenditure of F$6.4 million on the fifty-one subprojects, FDB financed
F$2.4 million (37.7 per cent) from the co-financed Bank/IBRD Loan and
F$1.8 million (27.5 per cent) from internal sources, commercial banks
financed $0.9 million (13.8 per cent) and subproject sponsors provided
F$1.3 million  (21 per cent).   Appendix 3 provides details of the
implementation of the subprojects.



- 152 -
22.       Procurement under the Bank Loan was mainly undertaken on a
"reasonable competition" basis, this mode of procurement accounting for
89.6 per cent of the utilization of the co-financed Bank/IBRD Loan.
Appendix 4 provides a summary of the pattern of procurement under the
Project. The major source country for procurement was Japan with 37.3 per
cent. The PCR Mission found that procurement procedures utilized by FDB
were in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines and Practices for South
Pacific countries.
2.   Financial Performance of Subtrojects
23.       Appendix S provides a slmmary'of the available data related to
the initial financial performance of subprojects. The PCR Mission found
a paucity of information with respect to subproject performance.  While
FDB requires the submission of regular financial reports from its
borrowers, receipt of such reports is normally only followed up when
serious arrears situations develop. Moreover, many of FDB's borrowers
operate as sole traders and do not produce formal business accounts. Only
28 of the 51 sub-borrowers had pro-'ided financial data summarizing the
operations of their businesses during the first year after, subloan
disbursement and only 22 sub-borrowers had provided data in the second
year of operation. Of the 28 subborrowers providing data on their first
year operations, 19 (68 per cent) achieved sales figures close to or
greater  than  those  they  had  originally  estimated.    In  terms  of
profitability, three made losses during the initial year of operation and
fifteen (54 per cent) achieved profits similar to or greater than that
projected.   Of the twenty sub-borrowers  for whom profit data were
available for the second year of subproject operations, 13 earned profits
during that period similar to or greater than the levels projected at the
time of subproject appraisal.
3. Economic Performance of SubRroiects
24.       Data on the economic performance of subprojects were again
largely unavailable.   Appendix 6 summarizes  the available  data  on
incremental value added, incremental foreign exchange savings/earnings and
employment creation.   Fourteen subborrowers that provided such data
reported total incremental value added of F$2.3 million for their first
year of full operation.   The same 14 subborrowers  reported  total
incremental foreign exchange earnings or savings of F$3.6 million for the
same period. Forty-three subborrowers had provided data on employment
creation and reported that new jobs created totalled 210, 58 less than
estimated from the subproject appraisals.
4.   Current Status of Suburojects
25.       Appendix 7 summarizes the current status of subprojects, as at
31 March 1990. By that date, 24 subloans representing 35.2 per-cent of
disbursements under the co-financed loans had been fuilly repaid. Eight
subprojects representing 22.6 per cent of the value of disbursements under
the Project were in arrears. Two further subprojects had failed although



- 153-
neither was in arrears and on. had fully repaid the subloan.   The
outstanding subloan balances including the component funded from FDB' s
internal sources at 31 March 1990 was equivalent to 38.2 per cent of total
disbursement.
D. The Line of Enuitt
26.       Tho Bank Line of Equity of 8250,000 provided as part of the
Project was intended to supplement FD's  own annual allocation of
F$200,000 for equity investment operations during the PY 1988 period. The
Bank Line of Equity wa intended for im estment in medium-sized industrial
enterprises with a maximum Bank  investment of $lO0,0in any single
enterprise.
27.       Appendix 8, which provides an analysis of FDB's loan and equity
investment operations during the period FY 1985 to FY 1989, shows that FDB
provided equity investments fron its own resources of F$3.2 million during
FT 1986 followed by F$273,000, F$168,000 and F$440,000 during the
following three fiscal years. The high level of equity investment during
FT 1986 mainly reflected FDB's investment in Fijian Property Trust Co. Ltd
(F$2.6 million) which was established to promote investment in real estate
developments.  FDB also invested in excess of F$500,000 in industrial
enterprises during FY 1986; these investment opportunities had been
identified earlier as pipeline projects for the Bank's investment.
However, delays in declaring the Project effective (para 42) precluded the
utilization of the Line of Equity for these projects. During the period
subsequent to FY 1986, FDB had difficulty identifying further projects
suitable for the Bank's investment. Furthermore, during FYs 1987 and 1988
in particular, FDB's own equity investment operations were relatively
inactive and supplementary financing was not required. FDB's management
found, in addition, that there was a marked reluctance from promoters of
small to medium sized enterprises to accept a large, international
institution as a shareholder in their projects.
28.       As a consequence, the Bank Line of EquLty was not utilized and
was cancelled in June 1988 with no project having been put forward for the
Bank's consideration.

29.       FDB's policy-making  and  governing  body  is  its  Board  of
Directors. The Board is appointed by ttw Kinister of Finance and
continues to comprise nine directors including five representatives of the
private  sector.   The composition of 1DB's Board of Directors has
substantially changed sinec the Bank Loan was approved in 1985. Only the
Chairman and Managing Director have reoained unchanged throughout the
period. The PCR Mission reviewd minutes of recent' Board meetings and
found that appropriate comercial guidanc  ws provided by the Board to
FDB's operations.



-154-
30.       Appendix 9 provides an outline of FDB's organization structure
at 30 December 1989. Since the time of appraisal of the Bank Loan, the
organization structure has been amended to allow for a third General
Manager  (General Manager Administration and Special  Projects).    In
addition, new divisions have been created for special projects, systems
and electronic data processing, audit and inspection and advisory
services. The changes to FDB's organization have reflected the need to
cope with the requirements of the growth of FDB's optrations.
31.       Perhaps the most difficult problem faced by FDB during the
period of utilization of the Bank Loan has been the dramatic staff
turnover since the political events of May 1987. There were a total of
102 resignations of professional staff between the period June 1987 to
June 1990. 1/ While many of the resignations were a result of emigration,
others reflected movement of experienced PDB staff to senior positions in
the public service and financial sector within Fiji. Many of the staff
who resigned held manager-level or higher positions including two General
Managers. The PCR Mission found that FDB's Managing Director b*s reacted
quickly and appropriately to this situation and has maintained active
recruitment and training programs. However there has been ar inevitable
deterioration in the levels of skill and experience within FDB. The Bank
technical assistance approved in October 1989 2/ was requested to
specifically address this problem.   Consultants recruited under this
technical assistance are currently in the field.
2.  Lending ODteraions
32.       An analysis of FDB's lending by sector for the period FY 1985
to FY 1989 is provided in Appendix 8. During the period FDB's total
lending increased at an average annual compounded growth rate of 6.9 per
cent, significantly less than the average growth rate of 18.5 per cent
projected at the time of appraisal of the Bank loan. The principal cause
of the relatively slow growth in lending was the political events of 1987
and 1988 and their dampening effect on investment levels.   A further
factor was the deterioration in FDB's staffing situation and the resulting
need to maintain a close control on loan quality.
33.       As a result of these factors, FDB's loan approvals declined by
35 per cent during FY 1988 over the previous year's figures. During FY
1989, a 42 per cent increase in lending levels was recorded following a
relatively strong recovery of agricultural investment, the rapid growth
of Fiji's garment industry and increased lending to ethnic Fijians for
industrial and comercial purposes.
J/   FDB's professional staff complement stood at around 100 to 115 during
the poriod.

F.   Financial Performance of FDB
1.   Size and Oualitv of Loan Portfolio
34.       Appendix 10 provides an analysis of FDB's portfolio arrears
during the period FY 1986 to FY 1989. During the period the total value
of FDB's loan portfolio increased by 18.9 per cent while total arrears
increased by 41 per cent. As a consequence, the ratio of total arrears
to total portfolio increased from 13.1 per cent to 15.5 per cent. Total
arrears had actually declined slightly between FYs 1986 and 1987 and the
largest increase occurred during the period prior to FY 1988. However,
available data indicate that FDB probably achieved satisfactory annual
collection ratios of 75 per cent or higher during the period up to FY
1987. Collection performance declined quite drastically during FY 1988
to a level of 48.9 per cent. As a result of remedial actions taken by
FDB's Management, collection performance improved markedly during FY 1989
to 68.1 per cent, a figure which compares quite favorably to that of
similar-sized DFIs receiving Bank loans.  Available data indicate that
during the period since June 1989, FDB has maintained an annual collection
ratio of between 65 and 70 per cent.
35.       The  sectoral  incidence- of FDB's  arrears has  not  altered
significantly since FY 1986. The proportion of arrears contributed from
agricultural loans has declined somewhat from 50 to 45 per cent while the
proportion of arrears attributed to industrial and commercial loans has
increased from 30 to 37 per cent. The contribution to total arrears from
the industrial loans to ethnic Fijians has remained stable at around 20
per cent despite the increased lending to that sector.
36.       Apart from increasing staff training inputs and imposing tighter
controls on loan quality to address the worsening arrears situation, FDB's
Management has strengthened the staffing of the operational units
responsible for hard-core loan administration.    The PCR Mission found
that FDB's Management had been responsive to the potentially difficult
portfolio situation that developed during FYs 1988 and 1989 and that the
actions taken had enabled a deteriorating situation to be controlled in
a timely manner.
2. Financial Position
37.       Appendixes 11, 12 and 13 provide comparative income statements,
cashflow statements and balance sheets for FDB for the period FY 1985 to
FY 1989.
38.       The  income  statements  show  that  FDB  remained  profitable
throughout the period. However, reported profits were significantly below
expectations from FY 1986 onward. A major reason for this situation was
the implementation of new accounting policies for the recording of income
from 1986 onward. While all interest charged had previously been reported
as income, from FY 1986 onward interest on all loans classified as non-



-156 -
performingl/ was not recorded as income until actually paid. The effect
of this policy has been to reduce FDB's reported profit by between F$0.5
mlllion and F$1.5 million per year over the period.   In addition,
significant increases were made in the annual provision for doubtful debts
from FY 1986 onward. Particularly large provisions of F$2.4 million and
F$3.1 million were made in FYs 1988 and 1989 respectively, reflecting a
prudent response from FDB's Management to the growing level of arrears.
As a result, FDB's provision for doubtful debts had increased to a healthy
11.25 per cent of total portfolio value by 30 June 1989.
39.       As shown in the cashflow statements, FDB has maintained better
than expected debt servicing capabilities throughout the period, despite
the decline in collection performance during FYs 1987 and 1988.   The
uneven debt servicing requirement over time that results from the nature
of FDB's domestic bond issuance program is demonstrated by the significant
drop in the debt service coverage ratio from 2.99 to 1.5 times between FYs
1988 and 1989 compared with the covenanted minimum level of 1.25 times
under the Bank Loan.
40.       During the five year period the Government provided total equity
injections of F$18.3 million, equivalent to 11.6 per cent of total loan
disbursements made by FDB over the period. New term debt from domestic
sources funded 37.2 percent of loan disbursements during the period and
foreign debt including the Bank Loan funded 7 per cent with the balance
44.2 per cent funded from cashflow.   FDB has maintained a relatively
conservative long term-debt to equity ratio of close to 2:1 throughout the
period compared with the covenanted maximum level of 3:1 under the Bank
Loan.
41.       Other  aspects  of  FDB's  financial  performance  have  been
satisfactory.
G.   Covenants
42.       Details of the loan covenants and their compliance status are
given in Appendix 14. The Bank loan covenants were substantially complied
with.            I
H. The Bank's Performance
43.       The second Bank loan to FDB was declared effective on 10 June
1986, seven months later than the original closing date for loan
effectiveness and following four extensions of that date. The delay in
making the loan effective resulted from the hesitancy of FDB's Management
to accept the interest rate of 9.65 per cent to be charged to FDB under
the Project. At the time of Loan negotiations, the Bank's OCR rate was
in excess of 11 per cent and FDB's Nanagement foresaw difficulties in
/   Under FDB's policies a loan is classed as non-performing if four or
more interest payments or loan repayments are in default.



- 157 -
utilizing the funds at that cost.  The OCR rate had fallen to a more
acceptable level from 1 July 1985 and FDB had indicated the Project should
proceed for Board approval. FDB retained some concern however over the
relatively high cost of the funds.
44.       The Bank's turn around time for processing of below the free
limit subloans averaged 11 days and for above free limit subloans was
about three weeks including the time taken in seeking clarification and
additional information. This turn around time was considered acceptable
by FDB's Management.
45.       The Bank did not mount regular annual review missions to FDB.
partly because of the relatively inactive nature of the loan, but also
because of the regular contact that was maintained between FDB and SPRO
staff.   SPRO staff concerned have followed a practice of visiting FDB
during one-two day transit stops in Fiji whilst travelling on Mission to
other South Pacific DMCs. The approach taken by SPRO to the supervision
of the loan is considered satisfactory.
II. EVALUATION
A.   ADpraisal
46.       The  appraisal mission's  evaluation of FDB's  institutional
capabilities and of Fiji's private sector investment environment was sound
and appropriate. The two major factors that affected the utilization of,
and economic contributions from, the loan were unforseen developments in
Fiji's financial markets and political conditions and could not have been
foreseen during appraisal. Despite the low utilization of the Loan, the
rationale for the Loan remains sound and was responsive to the
Government's economic development policies.
47.       The  covenants  and other  conditions  attached  to  the  Loan
reflected the appraisal mission's evaluation of FDB as a relatively mature
and soundly-managed DFI. The subsequent performance of FDB, particularly
in coping well with the effects of the political events since may 1987
have confirmed that the covenants and conditions were appropriately drawn.
B. Implementation
48.       Because 82 per cent of the Loan proceeds were not utilized, the
implementation of the loan cannot be assessed as satisfactory. However,
the performance of the subprojects financed as measured by the repayment
and arrears status of subloans can be assessed as satisfactory. A closer
assessment of the economic impact and financial performance of subprojects
cannot be made because of FDB's operational style which has resulted in
inadequate data being collected or retained for such assessment to be
made.   However,  the Mission considers that FDB's effectiveness as a



- 1i8 -
relatively efficient financial intermediary may outweigh the disadvantages
that have accrued from the low priority afforded to collection of
subproject performnce data.
IV.       SIhNL
49.       The PCR Mission hax concluded that the Project provided a
worthwhile contribution to FDB's operstions during the period 1986 to 1988
through the financing of 51 subprojects that achieved a reasonable level
of success and through making available, total foreign exchange resources
for on-lending of $10.5 million. The availability of those resources
enabled FDB to undertake with confidence, a program of expanded lending
that was expected to result in an average annual growth rate for loan
approvals of 18.5 per cent over a five year period. The fact that only
17 per cent of the Loan was utilized was largely a result of unforseoen
factors including depressed investment levels resulting from the effects
of political developments during 1987 and 1988 and the availability of
relatively low cost funds from domestic sources and from other external
agencies.
sO.      Factors that were apparent at the time of loan appraisal and
that, in retrospect, can be assessed as important contributors to the low
utilization of the Loan, include the relatively unattractive fixed
interest rate charged at the time on the Bank's OCR Loans and FDB's
operational style, which was not fully compatible with the Bank's
procedures for implementing line-of-credit projects.
51.      The non-utilisation of the Line of Equity was partly caused by
timing factors that precluded the Bank being offered investment
opportunities for 1985 pipeline projects. Another important consideration
however, was the concern held by entrepreneurs over the effect of
including a large international institution as a shareholder in relatively
small enterprises.
52.      During the period of the Loan's utilisation, FDB demonstrated
a capability for responding promptly and appropriately to adverse
circumstance, largely through astute leadership from its senior
management. As a result, FD3 remains a relatively effective and
financially strong DPI.
53.      Based on the Bank's experience with this Project, there may be
scope for reconsideration of some of the Bank's procedures for the
implementation of line-of-credit projects, particularly in those cases
where the line-of-credit is provided to a comercial bank or to a
relatively strong DFI that does not utilise the same project evaluation
and project supervision fomat followed by more conveftitional DFIs.



-159-
54.       Th  Mission also conaLders that, subject to development of a
more apparent demand for external resources for the financing of private
sector investment ln Fiji, the Bank could consider utilising an "umbrella"
lne-of-credit approach that incorporates commrcial banks as well as FDB
as executing agencLes for its future private sector operations in that
country.

FIJI DEVELOPMENT BANK
STATEMENT OF OPERATING STRATEGY AND GENERAL BUSINESS POLICY
I. THE BANK
1.        The Fiji Development Bank (FDB) was established in accordance
with the provisions of the Fiji Development Bank Act approved in December
1966, as amended, as a development financing institution for the direct
support of Fiji's economic development.   FDB is an autonomous statutory
body with its own Board of Directors, whose members are appointed by the
Minister of Finance.   It conducts its activities within the framework of
the Government's economic plans, policies and priorities.
II. BASIC OPERATING STRATEGY
2.        FDB's operating strategy includes the following primary elements:
a.   To  provide  loan  financing  primarily  to  agricultural  and
industrial enterprises operating in Fiji in a manner that will
support the realization of official national economic planning
goals and establish well balanced lending program in the major
economic sectors;
b.   To take equity participation in business enterprises and joint
ventures  with  the  aim  of  eventually  distributing   such
participation in support of wider participation of the general
public and institutional investors in the ownership of business
enterprises in Fiji;
c.   To contribute to and participate in the Government's economic
planning processes;
d.   To  contribute  to  the  national  development  process  through
increased activity in project identification, determination of
project feasibility and assistance in project implementation;
e.   To promote the planning and development of supervised lending
schemes;
f.   To  review  the need for  and,  where  appropriate,  to promote
development of auxiliary financing facilities in Fiji, such as
capital equipment leasing;
(Reference in text: page 3, para.12)



-162 -
Appendix l
Page 2
g.   To  furnish  constructive  business  development  and  business
management counsel to actual and prospective entrepreneurs and
managers in Fiji;
h.   To collaborate with and assist other statutory bodies in the
planning and financing of development projects and enterprises;
and
i.   To establish specific short and medium term objectives each year
by major economic sector.
III. SCOPE OF OPERATIONS
3.        FDB will provide  financial assistance  to priyate  sector and
public sector enterprises, in each case against security and/or guarantees
acceptable to FDB Management, in the following forms;
Medium and Long term loans; and
-    Short term working capital advances  in association with
medium and long term loans.
4.        FDB will also provide guarantees to all classes of enterprise it
considers appropriate and financially sound.
5.        FDB will take equity positions in all classes of enterprise with
the express purpose of subsequently distributing shares thus acquired to
the general public and institutional investors. In association with equity
investment, FDB will also underwrite equity issues.
6.        Other  related  support and  assistance  that FDB will provide
includes assistance to entrepreneurs and uanagers in ascertaining project
feasibility, in selecting appropriate accounting and control systems, in
a"sessing operating performance and in identifying appropriate sources of
further external advice and assistance.
7.        FDB will actively promote the establishment of new projects and
the formulation of new enterprises in collaboration with the Economic

Page 3
A.   Agriculture
9.             FDB  will  make  loans  to  individual  farmers,  farmers'
cooperatives and corporate entities.   In extending such loans, FDB will
give priority to developmental projects in agriculture and to supervised
lending schemes.
10.       FDB  may  provide  finance  to  assist  in  the  acquisition  of
agricultural land where this is in support of agricultural development
projects.   FDB will give priority in relation to the purchase of fishing
vessels and equipment to those projects which have good prospects for
expansion and development in the fisheries field.
B.   Industry and Commerce
11.       FDB will make medium and long term loans for investment in fixed
assets and to meet permanent working capital requirements in industrial
enterprises.   It may supplement such assistance by providing short term
advances to cover temporary working capital requirements.
12.       FDB will make loans to commercial enterprises for the acquisition
of fixed assets only.
C. Industrial and Commercial Loans to Filians
13.       To give those of Fijian race better opportunity to engage in
industrial and commercial activities, FDB will extend medium and long term
loans to Fijians in connection with viable industrial and commercial
projects and will provide working capital advances for such projects.
These loans will be extended on concessionary terms and, in cases where
Government guarantees are applicable, with reduced security requirements.
FDB will also finance on the same terms joint ventures between Fijians and
non-Fijians where Fijians are the effective beneficiaries of not less than
25 per cent of the equity of such ventures.
IV. DEVELOPMENTL POLICIES

substitution;
(e) make use of labor intensive technologies;
(f) introduce new technologies;
(g) contribute to a diversification of the economy; and
(h) create opportunities for the small emerging entrepreneurs.
V. GENERAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
15.       Financial assistance will be provided only for projects which
appear  to  be  economically  and  technically  viable  and  financially
profitable. Special attention will be given to the quality of management
of the enterprise and market prospects of the project.
16.       Applicants requesting financial assistance from FDB shall be
required to submit the project application in writing. FDB may provide
assistance to loan applicants as follows:
a.   Assistance in the preparation of project specifications and
feasibility studies;
b.   Referral  of  applicants  to  experts  and/or  sources  of
information relating to their projects;
c.   Advice and assistance in the selection and installation of
appropriate accounting books and records and related
operating controls; and
d.   Initial guidance in the preparation of periodic statements
and reports.
17.       Applicants shall be required to finance a reasonable portion of
the total project cost from their own resources to ensure that the total
financial requirements for the successful implementation of the project are
available.
18.       Loans will be disbursed taking into account the promoter's c.wn
financial contribution against proper documentation and in line with the
requirements of the investment schedule of the project.

Page 5
When necessary, FDB will endeavor to provide the necessary services to such
enterprises or it will refer them to other appropriate and available
sources of assistance.
20.       The repayment period of loans, including grace period, will be
determined in accordance with the nature and individual circumstances of
the projects.
21.       The financial assistance from FDB may be used to complement that
of other lenders.   In cases where the requested financial assistance
exceeds the limits of the Bank's lending capacity, the Bank may consider
joint financing arrangements.
VI. FINANCIAL GUIDELINES
22.       The rates of interest applicable to the various types of loans
will be determined and reviewed by FDB from time to time, in the light of
developments in the capital market with due consideration to the cost of
the FDB's own borrowings from domestic and other sources.
23.       FDB will secure its loans by appropriate collateral coverage and
guarantees from its borrowers, in accordance with sound banking practices.
but in doing so the Bank will have due regard to its developmenta.
functions in the Fiji economy.
24.       The Bank will not carry the foreign exchange risk on its debt s
repayable in foreign currency. In the event the Government or its agencie,
are not prepared to bear the foreign exchange risk relating to its (FDBs
repayment of debts in foreign currency, such risk will be passed on to t:-..
Bank's borrowers.
25.       Except for the purpose of safeguarding its investment, FDB will
not seek a controlling interest in any enterprise in which it has invested.
FDB will not normally participate directly on a daily basis in the
management of an enterprise in which it holds an equity interest, but it
would expect to nominate representatives as members of the Board of
Directors of the enterprise to safeguard its interests and to contribute to
the success of the enterprise. As a rule, the FDB's equity participation
shall not exceed twenty-five percent (25 per cent) of the paid up capital
stock of an enterprise.   In the case of joint ventures and selected
projects deemed to be of national importance, FDB may invest in equity
participation up to 49 per cent of the paid up capital stock thereof.
26.       FDB's equity investment shall serve mainly as a catalytic agent
for the establishment of tnew enterprises and will normally dispose of such
equity investments as soon as this becomes feasible and a fair price can be
obtained therefrom. In all cases, FDB will make every effort to dispose of



-166-
Page 6
such equity investments within five years of its date of acquisition
thereof.
27.       FDB will not normally commit to a single enterprise, in the form
of share capital more than ton per cent (10 per cent) of its unimpaired
paid-in capital, earned surplus and reserves. The total equity investments
of the Bank shall not exceed, at any time, the aggregate amount of its own
unimpaired paid-in capital, earned surplus and free reserves.
28.       The Bank's total commitments in any single enterprise in whatever
form, i.e. loans, equity participation, guarantees or a combination
thereof, will not normally exceed fifteen per cent (15 per cent) of the sum
of its unimpaired paid-in capital, earned surplus and free reserves.
29.       The total commitment of the Bank in any single non-agricultural
enterprise will not exceed at any time 65 per cent of the total assets of
the enterprise including the Bank's own investment. This limit may go up
to eighty per cent in worthy projects meriting special consideration. for
agricultural projects the Bank's total commitment will not exceed eighty
per cent of total assets except for projects meriting special consideration
where an unsaleable lease of land is an essential feature.  These limits
may be exceeded in cases where the loan will be adequately secured because
additional securities over assets not forming part of the project are
available.
30.       In the case of commercial Loans to Fijians, there will be no
limitation on the loan to be provided, the sole determining factor being
the Bank's assessment of the economic, technical and management viability
of the project.
31.       In view of the risks involved in long-term financing, the Bank
will exercise prudence in incurring debt so as to maintain at all times a
well-balanced financial structure. The Bank will limit its borrowings to
ensure that its orutstanding long-term debts at any time shall not exceed
the equivalent of three (3) times the sum of its unimpaired paid-in
capital, earned surplus and free reserves.
32.       In managing its portfolio, the Bank will endeavor to diversify
its loans and investments in terms of type of industries, location and
sectors of industries being financed.
VII. ACCOUNTING
33.       The Bank will maintain accounting records adequate to reflect its
business operations and affairs in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and standards.

34.       The  Bank  will  engage  a  qualified  and  independent  public
accountant to audit its books and accounts every year.
VIll. PROVISIONS
35.       The  Bank  will  annually  make  appropriate  allocations  to  a
provision for protection against bad debts and investments in line with
size and quality of the Bank's loan and equity portfolio until such
provision equals five per cent (5 per cent) of the Bank's portfolio. FDB
shall transfer all its net portfolio or reserve fund until such reserve
equals 50 per cent of FDB's paid-in capital.
IX. REVISION OF POLICIES
36.       This Statement of General Business Policies has been approved by
the Bank's Board of Directors; any revision of the Statement shall require
the prior approval of two thirds of the members of the Board of Directors
of the Bank.
