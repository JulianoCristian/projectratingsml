Institution building assistance will also be\n            provided to TDB through various forms of technical\n            assistance designed to improve TDB's profitability and\n            operational efficiency.  The project will provide resources\n            to TDB to help meet its projected level of lending\n            operations over the three year commitment period, October\n            1986-October 1989.  Technical assistance will also be made\n            available to TDB.  The resources transferred as a line of\n            credit to TDB will cover its resource requirements from\n            1986-89.  Part of this credit will encourage expansion of\n            TDB's financing of relatively larger subprojects in its\n            pipeline.  The line of credit will enable TDB to meet its\n            normal lending demand while also encouraging selective and\n            limited expansion of its lending operations to relatively\n            larger subprojects which will not otherwise be eligible for\n            finance from TDB due to its limited available resources."}, "docdt": "1986-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
