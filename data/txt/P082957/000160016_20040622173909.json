Some\n            risks posed by the planned waste collection, treatment, and\n            disposal include the following: Prevent water contamination,\n            accidental pricking from sharps, and the infestation of\n            disease-carrying insects by ensuring groundwater and surface\n            water resources are kept separate from polluting sources,\n            ensuring that the disposal site will not be used neither be\n            used for either agricultural or residential purposes, and\n            lining the site with a closed, impermeable layer. To avoid\n            infection from recovering patients; the risk of the reuse\n            and sale of contaminated syringes; the increase in the\n            incidence of diseases like tetanus, typhoid, diarrhea,\n            hepatitis B, and HIV/AIDS; and the outbreak of respiratory\n            ailments and other infections among the general population\n            because of transporting untreated solid waste matter to dump\n            sites by cart or uncovered trucks, sort and segregate sharp\n            waste at the source, use different containers from those\n            used for household garbage, treat waste as appropriate,\n            transport waste in covered vehicles identified by signage\n            and traveling at restricted speeds. If disposal is by\n            incineration there is a risk to nearby residential areas of\n            air pollution from dioxins, heavy metals, and other\n            combustible materials, and to personnel involved in waste\n            disposal by incineration. To mitigate these risks, manage\n            waste storage, set up a system to filter the smoke emitted;\n            increase the height of the ventilation shaft/flume to permit\n            the release of residual pollutants; monitor plastic\n            material, glass and metal and other such materials, and\n            contents under pressure to prevent the incinerator from\n            dysfunction and toxic emissions or explosions; and direct\n            personnel to wear protective clothing and gear. To minimize\n            risks from burning waste in the open air such as the\n            dispersion of highly resistant microorganisms as well as the\n            increased incidence of respiratory infections and other\n            infections connected with hospitals, the proliferation of\n            disease carrying insects and rodents, and the diffusion of\n            smoke containing noncombustible pollutants, obtain and\n            manage adaptable elimination systems and treat the waste\n            before burning."}, "docdt": "2004-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
