 Project development objective: The project objective is to support the Recipient's multi-sectoral
 efforts to control the spreado fthe HIVIAIDSepidemic andprovide sustainableaccess to
 treatment and care to those infectedwith or affected byHIVIAIDS.This objective will be
 achieved by: (a) strengtheningthe Recipient's national responseto the HIVIAIDSepidemic; (b)
 raisingthe level of awarenesson HIVIAIDSthroughthe implementation of a comprehensive
 sensitization plantargetinghighrisk groups, such as the youth, sex workers andtruck drivers; (c)
 providing sustainable access to testing and counseling facilities; (d) providingaccess to
 treatment, care andpsychosocial support to persons infected with or affected byHIVIAIDS; and
 (e) strengtheningthe Recipient's capacity to address the HIVIAIDSepidemic andto maintainan
 effective monitoring and evaluation system.

 Project description [one-sentence summary of each component] Re$ PAD B.3.a, Technical
 Annex 4
 Component 1: Support to the public sector response (US$9.0 million). This component will help
 ministries andrelatedpublic institutions initiate andlor expand the responseto HIVIAIDS.The
 component will support the effort of every ministryto prepare andimplement sectoral plans that
 addressthe challenge o fHIVIAIDSwith a particular emphasis onprevention and care. Thus, the
 component will finance: (i) to the ministries'action plansfor HIVIAIDScontrol; and
                               support
 (ii)capacity buildingwithinthe Government to managethe fight against HIVIAIDSina
 sustainablemanner.

 Component 2: Support to the responseofthe private sector (US$4.7 million) The objective o f
 the component is to leveragethe capacity o fthe private sector inMali to accelerate and enhance
 the effectiveness of GOM's lead effort inthe fight against HIVIAIDS. This component will help
 mobilize and support the private sector inthe fight against HIVIAIDS. Support will be given
 for the creation o f a business coalition against HIVIAIDS with a missionto: (i) a forum
                                                                                  provide
 for exchange o fbest practices; (ii) formulate proposals to scale up isolated successful
 interventions to comprehensivenational programs; and (iii)     putexistingprivate sector expertise,
 distributionnetworks and other infrastructure at the disposal o fprogram execution. Small and
 MediumEnterprises (SMEs) would betargeted essentially through their Federations and
 ProfessionalAssociations with support for collective andindividualinitiatives. Special
 emphasis would be givento encourageparticipationby the informal sector through support for
 pilot anddemonstrative initiatives that couldbe scaleduprapidly.

 Component 3: Support to the Responseo fthe Civil Society (US$5.4 million). The objective o f
 the component is to develop and expand initiatives to combat HIVIAIDSby civil society
 organizations (CSOs), including community basedorganizations (CBOs), faith based
 organizations (FBOs), NGOs, women andyouth groups, associationso fpeople livingwith

AIDS, andother grass roots associations. Underthis component the capacity ofthese
organizations will be reinforced to identify, prepareandimplementactionplans andsub-
projects. The project would support CSOsthat are already active by helpingthem scaleuptheir
activities, as well as those CSOs that are newto the field by reinforcingtheir capacity. Support
will begivento CSOs to undertake three broadtypes ofactivities: (i)       provisiono f social
mobilizationandtraining services as well as technical assistanceto the preparation of their sub-
projects; (ii)execution of sub-projects; and (iii)  contractual support to M A P implementation,
particularlyinthe areao f decentralized M&E.

A. STRATEGICCONTEXTAND RATIONALE

1. Countryand sector issues

CountryIssues

Mali is one o f the poorest countries in the world due to its limited resource base, land-locked status,
vulnerability to external shocks, poor infrastructure, low levels o f human development and weak
administrative capacity. It is ranked 172 out of 175 countries in the 2003 UNDP Human Development
Index and, in2001, 63.8 percent o fthe populationwas estimated to be living inpoverty. According to the
2001 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) publishedby the Ministry o f Health and ORC Macro,
Mali's HIVIAIDS prevalence rate was estimated at 1.7 percent in2001.

While Mali continues to be a low HIV prevalence rate country by Sub-SaharanAfrican standards, it runs
a high risk o f experiencing an increase in prevalence rates due to a wide range o f factors that require
urgent and comprehensive action. Most recent data show that the percentage of HIV positive people
among blood donors has increased from 0.6 percent to 3.1 percent among the male population between
1993 and 2002, and from 1.3 percent to 6.4 percent among the female population over the same period.
HIV prevalence rates are also particularly acute among the following vulnerable groups: (i)migrant
populations such as truck-drivers, seasonalrural workers and traders; (ii)  youth; (iii) women, particularly
the young and pregnant; (iv) uniformedpersons; (v) sex workers; and (vi) miningworkers.

The following are key factors that could cause arapidincreaseofthe HIVIAIDSprevalence inMali:

    0   a large share of the population, particularly youth, still live in denial o f the risk represented by
        HIVIAIDS. A recent study sponsored by USAID concluded that 213 o f young Malians don't
        perceive the riskassociatedwith HIVIAIDS;

    0   the very fluid population migration patterns within the western Africa sub-region present a
        particular risk as neighboring countries such as Burkina Faso andCote d'Ivoire have much higher
        HIV prevalence rates of 6.5 percent and 10 percent respectively. Moreover, the political and
        social upheavals in Cote d'Ivoire, Liberia and Sierra Leone have caused refugee problems and
        large movements o f populations which further exacerbatethe HIV prevalence rates;

    0   the limited availability o f HIVIAIDS-related services in the country, particularly in high-risk
        locations, andthe weak targeting o f vectors o ftransmission;

    e   inAfrica, there is a stronggender inequality vis-&vis HIVIAIDSwith 58 percent ofHIV-infected
        people beingfemale. InMali, while comprehensive data are not available, it is widely suspected
        that this trend is also occurring as there are many gender inequities and traditional cultural norms
        that are favorable to the spread o f HIVIAIDS (e.g. early marriage o f adolescent girls and young
        women to older men, cultural practices which mandate marriage among in-laws upon death of a
        spouse, widespread polygamy whereby over 40 percent of women live in a polygamous
        marriage, andthe prevalent practice of female genital cutting); and

    0   the still limited capacity o f public institutions and other actors to develop and implement a
        comprehensive responseto this challenge.
These factors combined present serious challenges to Mali's future HIV prevalence rates. Simulations'
based on HIVIAIDS forecasting models show that, without any intervention, the prevalence rate could

increase dramatically to 5 percent in 2006 and 10 percent in 2009. The potential impact o f such an
evolution interms o f human lives, health costs, productivity, social costs, and education would be huge2.

 Mali's PRSP (finalized in 2002) emphasizes better provision o f core basic social services in health,
 education, and HIVlAIDS. In particular, the PRSP highlights that the fight against HIVIAIDS is
 supported by political commitment at the highest andbroadest levels within the country's institutions and
 among Maliancivil society. The program is coordinated politically by the President's Oflice throughthe
 HighNational Council on HIVlAIDS (HNAC) and technically by the Ministryo f Healthwhich oversees
 the program.

 In order to accelerate its fight against the HIVIAIDS epidemic, the Government of Mali (GOM) has
 recently taken highprofile actions. InMarch 2004, an institutional realignment took place by increasing
 the representation of boththe private sector and the civil society inthe HNAC; and in April, 2004, the
 Government adopted a Letter of Sector Policy that reiterates the objectives o fthe National Strategic Plan
 and emphasizesthe commitment to a multi-sectoral approach to fightingHIVIAIDS. Inthe light o f the
 new policy paper, a new National Strategic Plan for the period o f 2005-2010 is under preparation and
 should be completed by end 2004. All development partners such as UNAIDS, WHO, UNDP, UNICEF,
 USAID, Canada, The Netherlands, the WFP, UNFPA, UNESCO, GTZ, France and the World Bank are
 involvedthroughout the process.

Sector issues

As indicated above, the limited effectiveness o f previous efforts to fight HIVIAIDS in Mali stems from
the fact that the response has primarily been framed as a health issue. However, it is now recognized that
the threat of HIVlAIDS is not only a health issue but a development issue engaging virtually all sectors
and elements of society, Furthermore, the institutional framework has had neither the ability nor the
leverage to trigger the needed strong actions. As a result o f these lessons learnt, the GOM has chosento
scale up activities for fightingHIVIAIDSina more multi-sectoral and comprehensive manner.

There is currently an estimated 170,000 HIV positive people inMali of which 10 percent are inneed of
treatment. The remaininghave not reachedthe trigger point which warrants treatment. It is also estimated
that o fthe 17,000 who should be receiving Anti-Retroviral drugs (ARV), at present only 6 percent o fthat
number have access to ARV due to: (i)         deficiencies inthe supply chain o f drugs, (ii) o f knowledge
                                                                                            lack
about their HIV status; (iii)high price o f the drugs; and (iv) absence o f biological monitoring system
("plateau technique"). In light o fthe above and inview o f the manageable size o f the problem, the GOM
has decided to make ARVs available for free as a cornerstone o f its strategy o f HIVlAIDS containment.

For treatment to be effective it has to be accompanied by a set of other services (testing, counseling,
patient monitoring, etc.) all o f which should be delivered as a monitored package as close to the
patientibeneficiary as possible, At present, the existing system is deficient due to: (i)insufficient
communication for behavior change; (ii)         weak testing and counseling capacities; and (iii)inadequate
institutional framework. The GOM has increasingly become aware o fthe relevance o fthese constraints in
its inability to intensify its effort to fight HIVlAIDS.

To address all these sectoral issues, the strategic response o f the GOM is anchored around three
complementary pillars, with private sector participation central to each: (i>     intensifying communication
and education to raise awareness of the HIVlAIDS epidemic; (ii)expand access to testing facilities and
counseling services; and (iii)provide treatment to those infected and care to the affected groups (orphans
and women).

EligibilityofMalifor MAP 2 Funding

The Multi-Country HIVIAIDS Program for the Africa Region (MAP), approved by the Board of
Directors inJanuary 2002, provides the framework o f support to Mali inits fight against HIVIAIDS. It is
established that Mali meets the followingMAP eligibility criteria:

   (i)      Satisfactory evidence of a strategic approach to HIVIAIDS. Mali's HIVIAIDS National
             Strategic Plan for 2001-2005 is a sound national HIVlAlDS strategy which was developed in
            a participatory manner and which is backed by a strong Government commitment. A Letter
            o f Sector Policy emphasizing the multi-sectoral approach was adopted by the Government in
            April 2004 (Annex 18); and a new National Strategic Plan for 2005-2010 is beingprepared
            with a view to beingfinalized by end 2004.

   (ii)     Existence of a high level HIVIAIDS coordinating body. A HighNational Council on
            HIVIAIDS(HNAC - HCNLS) has been set-up and is led by the President. Duringproject
            preparation, the composition o f the HNAC was revised to make it more multi-sectoral and
            more inclusive o f the stakeholders. A decree setting up a tripartite HNAC (one third public
            sector, one third private sector, and one thirdcivil society) was signed on March 31,2004.

    (iii)   Governmentagreement to use exceptionalimplementation arrangements. A key feature
            o f the Mali MAP is that the GOM will leverage private sector capacity under the umbrella o f
            corporate social responsibility to enhance implementation capacity and accountability for the
            fight against HIVAIDS inthe country. GOM's willingness to adopt exceptional procedures
            for the implementation of the MAP is evident by the fact that it has agreed that two private
            sector firms will be selected to handle procurement and financial management issues
            respectively. The Contract Management Agency (CMA) will evaluate and approve all sub-
            project manuals.

    (iv)    Confirmation of the Government's commitment to transfer resources to multiple
            implementation agencies in order to reach all regions and segments of the population.
            Project design reflects agreement reached with the GOM to transfer resources to all
            implementing agencies so as to ensure an effective national response to the HIVIAIDS
            epidemic. This includes the funding o f action plans and sub-projects put forward by line
            ministries and other public institutions, as well as by the private sector and civil society
            organizations (CSOs),      which include community based organizations, faith based
            organizations, non-governmental organizations, women groups and other grass roots
            associations).




                                                      3

2. Rationalefor Bankinvolvement

The GOM realizes that it alone will not be able to face the daunting challenge that the spread of
HIVIAIDS represents. It has therefore requestedthe Bank to use the framework of MAP 2 as its global
reach and convening power will help define and implement a multi-sectoral policy framework
underpinned by effective, acceptable and encompassing institutional arrangements that can support its
strategic response to HIVIAIDS. The proposed MAP is the World Bank's responseto this request. Under
the proposed MAP, support will be provided to the GOMinorder to:


    0   Mainstream the fight against HIVIAIDS into the economic and social development agenda
        Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) of the GOM. The Bank is active across the whole o f
        Mali's development agenda and this is essential in helping the GOM elevate HIVIAIDS beyond
        the health sector, ensure strong linkages to the PRSP, and integrate HIVIAIDS responses into
        various sectoral plans;

    0   Provide the GOM with access to international best practices in relevant and critical areas of its
        program o f fight against HIVIAIDS. The Bank's long-term and sustained commitment to fighting
        HIVIAIDSboth inthe past andfor the future is essential to accelerate implementationdrawingon
        the global knowledge accumulated from other MAPS;

    0   help the GOM leverage international public and private resources to underwrite the exceptional
        cost associatedwith the fight against HIVIAIDS. Under the proposed MAP, systems will be put
         inplace to provideconfidence that resourceswill be available to support andsustain a substantial
        campaign against HIVIAIDS;

    0   expand delivery capacity for HIVIAIDS related actions by building sustainable domestic
        institutional capacity while leveraging, through social corporate responsibility, private sector
        expertise and capacity.


3. Higherlevelobjectivesto which the projectcontributes

The FY04-OS CAS, which was discussed by the Board on July 31, 2003 and which is based on Mali's
PRSP, has three main themes: (i)   Promoting Growth; (ii) Developing HumanResources; and(iii)    Public
Finance Management andGovernance. With respectto: (ii),     the CAS identifiesthe reversal ofthe spread
o f HIVIAIDS as one o f the key development objectives andproposes a Multi-Sectoral HIVIAIDSProject
to support this goal. This project, which is provided for inthe CAS base case scenario, will encourage
and pull together sectoral efforts, and put in place programs in critical sectors such as agricufture,
education, transport, mining, the m y , etc.

In addition, the project supports Goal No. 6 of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) - Combat
HIVIAIDS, malaria and other diseases - as well as Goal No. 8 o f the MDGs on partnership for
development. These MDGstarget the buildingo f effective prevention andtreatment programs which will
save lives, reduce poverty and help economies develop, as well as advocate for strong coordination
among various players inthe fight against HIVIAIDS. Moreover, the project supports the goals under the
New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), .and the NEPAD Secretariat has specifically
requestedthe Bank's support infightingHIVIAIDS inAfrica.

B. PROJECTDESCRIPTION

1. Lendinginstrument

The proposed project is a full IDA grant inthe amount o f $25.5 million equivalent. The project was part
of the FY04-06 lendingprogram that was set out inthe July 2003 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for

                                                    4

Mali. The IDA grant for this project is in line with the September 2002 World Bank Group Board
decision to extend grant financing to MAPSunder the IDA 13 replenishment framework. Mali is eligible
for IDA grants as it is among the poorest IDA-only countries that are particularly vulnerable to longer-
term debt sustainabilityproblems.

2. Project development objective and key indicators

Project development objective: The project objective is to support the Recipient's multi-sectoral efforts
to control the spread of the HNIAIDS epidemic and provide sustainable access to treatment and care to
those infected with or affected by HIVIALDS. This objective will be achieved by: (a) strengthening the
Recipient's national responseto the HIVIAIDS epidemic; (b) raising the level o fawarenesson HIVIAIDS
through the implementation of a comprehensive sensitization plan targeting highrisk groups, such as the
youth, sex workers and truck drivers; (c) providing sustainable access to testing and counseling facilities;
(d) providing access to treatment, care and psychosocial support to persons infected with or affected by
HrVIAIDS; and (e) strengthening the Recipient's capacity to address the HIVlAIDS epidemic and to
maintain an effective monitoringandevaluation system.


Key performance indicators

Outcome Indicators: The followingkey outcome indicators are expected from the project: (i)        HIVIAIDS
prevalence among population of age 15-49 i s contained at 1.7 percent and eventually reversed by 2009;
and (ii) at least 15,000 orphans attend school regularly by the end o f 2009.

Outpuflrocess Indicators: By end o f 2009: (i)          Throughout the project implementation, at least 70

usingcurricula that incorporate HIVIAIDSina skills-based learningapproach; (iv) percentageo fsexually
active men with a non-regular partner and using condoms increases from 33 percent in 2004 to 60
percent; (v) at least 80 percent of employees o f private firms, business associations, SOEs and public
institutions have received information on HIVIAIDS; (vi) percentage o f ambulatory vendors who used
condoms with the last non marital and non cohabitating partner increased from 18 percent to 75 percent
(vii) percentage o f women and menwho know at least two ways to avoid HIVlAIDS increases from 13.3
percent and 59.7 percent respectively to 75 percent; (viii) number o f non-government centers offering
Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) services increased from 15 to 55; (ix) 55 reference health
centers and 400 Centre de santd c o ~ ~ ~ n a ~ t(CSCOMs) are providing testing and counseling; (x) at
                                                      a i r e
least 9,000 o f People Living with HNIAIDS (PLWA) who are medically eligible for treatment (CD4
count less than 200) are under ARV treatment before end 2007; (xi) a score card monitoring progress o f
key performance indicators of the implementation of the strategy is updated and circulated to HNAC
duringsemi-annual meeting; (xii) 24 surveillance sentinel sites for pregnant women are functionalby end
2005; and (xiii) 100percent o f blood is tested for HIVIAIDS by project closing.

3. Project Components

The pillars o fthe integrated response:

The following three pillars represent the elements ofthe integrated response to HIVIAIDS that Mali has
formulated: (i)  prevention and sensitization; (ii) and counseling; and (iii) to treatment and
                                                    testing                           access
care. This will be done through fundingo f four components: (i)     public sector response; (ii) sector
                                                                                                private
response; (iii)civil society response; and (iv) program coordinationand monitoringandevaluation.

Prevention and sensitization. The project would provide support for heightening awareness of the
HIVIAIDS issues through provision of information, education and communication. In prevention, a

                                                        5

particular emphasis will be put on youth, who hold the promise o f learning safe behavior. The examples
o f Thailand, Uganda and Zambia show that action in this area can yield important results. Giving these
young people an HIV-free start to their adult lives is critical to building a country's fiture. Campaigns
targeted at special groups such as truck drivers and sex workers will also be undertaken. Partnerships with
the private sector throughjoint financing and implementation will be sought through performance-based
contracts.

Testingand counseling. The project will support the expansion o f testing and counseling services and
encourage nationwide voluntary testing. Inaddition to a reference laboratory inBamako, there will be a
network o f laboratories across the country whose staff will be trained and certified to carry out testing,
counseling and monitoring. The focus will initially be onthose regions with the most urgent needs, and be
expanded geographically over time. The private sector is keento develop partnerships inthis area.

Treatment and care. The project will help increase access to drugs and care for PLWHA. Only 1,073
people are currently getting ARVs and three distribution centers are active in Bamako. The GOM has
recently decided to increaseaccess to drugs and ARVs will be free inthat context, with the support o f the
MAP. This is expected to be eventually supplemented by the Global Fund resources that would help
increase access to life-prolonging drugs for tuberculosis and other opportunistic infections, as well as
Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs). Given the vicious circles that AIDS drives, the project will
support a basic package o f care for those infected and affected by the virus, especially in the form o f
tuition support for orphans o f HIVIAIDS. Also, the project will ensure the strengthening o f the non
medication complement (nutritional, psychosocial) relying on a public-private partnership delivery
system. The Grant will finance activities related to these pillars through four components: public sector
response, private sector response, civil society, and program management andM&E.

Component 1: Supportto the publicsector response(US$9.0 million)

This component will help ministries and relatedpublic institutions initiate andlor expandthe response to
HIVIAIDS. The component will support the effort o f every ministry to prepare and implement sectoral
plans that address the challenge o f HlVlAIDS with a particular emphasis on prevention and care. Thus,
the component will finance:

     e   support to the ministries' actionplans for HIVIAIDS control; and
     e   capacity buildingwithinthe Government to managethe fight against HIVIAIDS ina sustainable
         manner.
Underthe first mainactivity, the projectwill provideassistanceto ministries:

     e   to prepare sectoral actions plans against HIVIAIDS for the period 2004-2010 that are
     commensurate with the new government policy in this area and to execute them using contractual

     potential overlaps across ministries. More specifically, the project will provide technical assistance-
     arrangements with the private sector and NGOs. Sector plans will have to take into consideration

     primarily consultant services- to HIVIAIDS units within the public sector to frame adequately their
     sectoral response policies, to translate them into action plans. Municipalities and decentralized
     government entities will also be able to submit proposals under this component.

     e   to implement the action plans through providing ministries' staff and their dependents with
     information on HIVlAIDS and opportunistic infections, education, training, condoms and other
     support to encourage HIVIAIDS avoidance behavior. Where needed, the project will finance
     equipment (e.g. basic computer system) and cover the incremental operating costs (e.g. basic
     supplies).

 The MAP support to the Ministry of Health will complement the on-going support which is being
 provided from donors and the Bank to Mali's ten-year health sector development program (Plan

                                                      6

Dbcennal de D~veloppementdu Secteur de la Sante?. The Bank's support to the PDDSS is channeled
through its Health Sector Project, the Projet de De`veloppementdu Secteur de la Sante`,which will close
 inDecember 2005 andwhich still has around US$20millionequivalent to disburse. Some ofthis money
could be re-directed towards fighting HIVIAIDS. In addition, each year Mali's health sector spends
around US$2 million equivalent from HIPC for the fight against HIVIAIDS. Finally, the Global Fundas
well as the African Development Bank (AfDB) are expected to extend additional funding to GOM's
program withinthe comingmonths.

 With respect to the secondmain activity pertainingto capacity building, the MAPwill provide support
for the following:

     e   strengthening of surveillance and epidemiological operational research to provide information
         on the evolution o f the epidemic, using biological and behavioral surveillance and additional
         research among vulnerable groups. This activity is mainly financed by other donors and the
         MAP will provide complements when needed; and

     e   complementingactivities undertakenby the MOHinthe area of:
              o expansion of the network of voluntary testing and counseling (VCT) services by
                 leveraging the network of CSCOMs so as to improve access particularly inthe country
                 side;
              o improvement in the prevention of HIV/AIDS/STI transmission through sensitization
                 campaigns and peer education addressed at the staff o f various ministries and public
                 entities to understand HIVIAIDS issues, to adapt their actions against HIVlAIDS as
                 necessary, and to reach out to their relevant partners and audience (e.g. parent-teachers
                 associations, women's associations, mine workers associations, ...) for prevention,
                 treatment, care and psychosocial support related to HIVIAIDS. Prevention will also be
                 enhanced by training technical staff and by fmalizing norms and standards;
              o expansion of the capacity to treat and monitorpatients underARK
              o management of the bio-medical waste so as to address the issues raised in the report
                 prepared to that effect (e.g. prevention o f contamination risks related to improper
                 disposal o fneedles, etc.. .)


Component2: Supportto the responseof the privatesector (uS$4.7 million)
                                                                         -
The objective of the component is to leverage the capacity o f the private sector inMali to accelerate and
enhancethe effectiveness o f GOM's lead effort inthe fight against HIV/AIDS.

This component will help mobilize andsupport the private sector inthe fight against HIVIAIDS. Support
will be given for the creation o f a business coalition against HIVIAIDS with a mission to: (i)provide a
forum for exchange o f best practices; (ii) formulate proposals to scale up isolatedsuccessful interventions
to comprehensive national programs; and (iii)   put existing private sector expertise, distribution networks
and other infrastructure at the disposal o f program execution. Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)
would be targeted essentially through their Federations and Professional Associations with support for
collective and individual initiatives. Special emphasis would be given to encourage participation by the
informal sector through support for pilot and demonstrative initiativesthat could be scaled up rapidly.

This component will finance the following activities: (i)awareness raising activities, including the
distribution o f condoms; (ii)development o f HIVIAIDS education modules for private schools; (iii)
training o f employees o f private enterprises on HIVIAIDS related issues; (iv) support to the development
of private voluntary counseling and testing centers; and (v) contribution to the cost o f treatment and care
for PLWHA. This will be achieved through a grant mechanism, ranging from 50 percent to 100 percent

                                                      7

o f the activity cost, designed to encourage initiatives from the private sector to intensify awareness
raisinglprevention, testinglcounseling and access to medication and care for employees. Funds would be
channeled through grants to companies directly or through their associations. Company-specific
HIVlAIDS programs will be supported on a 50 percent subsidy from the project for programs that cover
the employees only, and seventy five percent for programs that extendbeyondthe company confines. For
small businesses and their associations, the project will extend a 100 percent grant to support the
implementation o f sub-projects. The determination o f the cost to the project o f actions consisting o f
company know-how sharing, the use o f distribution networks and other physical infrastructure will be
assessedon a case by case basis.

Component 3: Support to the Response of the Civil Society (US$5.4 million)

The objective o fthe component is to develop andexpand initiatives to combat HIVIAIDS by civil society
organizations (CSOs), including community based organizations (CBOs), faith based organizations
(FBOs), NGOs, women andyouth groups, associations o f people living with AIDS, and other grass roots
associations. Under this component the capacity o f these organizations will be reinforced to identify,
prepare and implement action plansand sub-projects.

The project would support CSOs that are already active by helpingthem scale up their activities, as well
as those CSOs that are new to the field by reinforcing their capacity. Support will be given to CSOs to
undertake three broadtypes of activities: (i)provision o f social mobilization and training services as well
as technical assistance to the preparation o f their sub-projects; (ii)execution o f sub-projects; and (iii)
contractual support to MAP implementation, particularly inthe area o f decentralized M&E.

Funds will be channeled directly to CSOs to cover a wide range o f activities inthe areas of awareness
raisinglprevention, testinglcounseling, access to medicatiodmedical care, provision of home and
community based care for patients, and social support to PLWHA, family members and orphans, CSOs
will be encouraged to become franchisees for VCT, andcare giving. The increasedavailability o ftesting,
counseling and treatment centers will be complemented by community information and mobilization
campaigns. A free phone line will be established to provide information on HIVlAIDS and refer people
to the expanded network o f services provided by the MAP, Examples o f activities eligible for support to
CSOs include: (i)   awareness raising workshops; (ii)  peer-group counseling services among adolescents,
commercial sex workers and other high risk groups; (iii)    community radio programs; (iv) development
and implementation o f culturally acceptable social marketing approaches for condoms; and (v) promotion
of collaboration with traditional health practitioners. Under this component, assistance to vulnerable
groups affected by IV/AIDS, particularly orphans, will be provided so as to help them continue to have
adequate access to the required basic services.


Component4: ProjectCoordination,Monitoringand Evaluation(US$6.4 million)

The project will be managedby the Executive Secretariat ofthe HNAC with the mandateto carry out the
multi-sectoral National Strategic Plan for 2005-2010 and the new sector policy adopted by the GOM to
mainstream the HIVlAIDS agenda into all sectors. The ESII-INAC will be comprised o f the following
core team: an Executive Secretary and a maximum o f four technical advisors in charge o f facilitating
implementation o f each component and ensuring preventiodsensitization. These advisors will cover the
following issues: (a) public health issues, especially for testing and counseling; (b) access to drugs, care
and psychosocial support; (c) outreach for the mobilization o f the various actors; and (d) monitoring and
evaluation. In addition, there will be two staff members in charge o f financial management and
procurement issues respectively, and three support stafE an accountant, an executive assistant, and a
driver, The FMAand CMA will be under contract with the ESII-INAC to managethe day to day financial,
procurement and contract management transactions o f the project. The financial and the procurement
officers within the ESII-INAC will have the responsibility o f liaising with the FMA and CMA to make

                                                     8

sure that they meet their obligations, to prepare relevant reports for the HNAC, and to bridge to other
programs against HIVlAIDS on issues o ftheir respective responsibility.


This component will consist of the provision of: (i)    technical support services, equipment and materials;
(ii)a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system including finaiicial and technical aspects of
program implementation; (iii)     epidemiological surveillance, operational research andsurveys; (iv) support
for a demographic and health survey and a bio-annual behavioral surveillance survey to monitor
behavioral change among targeted groups; and (v) training, supervision, as well as certification of
structures such as laboratories, VCT and treatment centers, andpharmacies providing ARVs.

The Executive Secretariat o fthe HNAC will coordinate the national HIV responseandmonitor, through a
comprehensive M&Esystem, the progress towards achievingthe performance targets. A11key actors in
the fight againstHIVlAIDS will contributeto the M&Esystem,

4. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design

The key lessons learned so far under the MAP1 and MAP2 programs are that an effective fight against
HIVIAIDSrequires: (i)strong political leadership and commitment; (ii)
                             a                                                 empowerment o f stakeholders
through genuine participation inpolicy making and implementation; (iii)       a multi-sector and decentralized
approach to service delivery; and (iv) a strong monitoring and evaluation system. Building on
international experience such as the cases of Uganda and Thailand, Mali has adopted a comprehensive
and multi-sector approach, with the leadership o f a National HIVlAIDS council, comprised of key
stakeholders' representatives. Moreover, Mali has realized that effective implementation calls for
exceptional arrangements that will ensure the channeling of resources directly to beneficiaries. This
entails contracting services o f procurement, financial management, monitoring and evaluation, as well as
some cross-sectoral activities such as training, communication for change o f behavior, etc..

While Mali has made progress in fighting HIVIAIDS in a number o f areas (e.g. establishment of a
HrVlAIDS program within the Ministry of Health, funding of drugs under the HTPC initiative), the
compelling need for increased effectiveness in this area is obvious in light o f the increase in prevalence
rates over time and o f the risks incurredfrom beingsurrounded by countries with higher prevalence rates.
The project will also seek to maximize the involvement of PLWA organizations in prevention and
counseling o fvulnerable people.

Contracting of fiduciary functions proposed for the project is based on the satisfactory performance
recorded with such arrangements incountries with HIVlAIDSproject funded under the MAP 2 umbrella.

5. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection

The various alternatives consideredwere as follows:

(i)analternative wastoprovideadditionalfundingunderthecurrentIDAHealthProject("Projet de
d e ` v e l o ~ ~ e ~dunsecteur de la sante`" - PRODESS). However, this project is under the control o f the
                     e t
MinistryofHealthandthus its scope is purelya health-sector one, The increasingnumber of HIVlAIDS
patients justifies a free standing multi-sector project that is not specifically health-focused. The
traditional operational mode whereby the emphasis was put on the medical aspects of the fight against
HIVlAIDS yielded very limited results: instead of containing effectively the spread o f HIVlAIDS, the
situation increasingly deteriorated. Therefore, it appearedthat there was a need for an interventionwhich
would be multi-sectoral by nature and would improve the institutional set-up for the fight against
HIVlAIDS and ensure that implementation arrangements would be more effective than the ones usedso
far which were constrained by the administrative bureaucracy.


                                                       9

(ii) second option was to streamline HWlAIDS activities into various Bank-financed activities.
    a
However, this approach would still lack the ability to raise the fight against HIVIAIDS to the needed
strategic level and to address properly cross-sectoral issues. For example, there are HWlAIDS activities
inthe Bank's agriculture and transport projects, but their scope is rather limited and the aggregation of
such contributions to the effort would not have the merits of a multi-sector and private sector-led MAP.
It is expected that such streamlining of HTVlAIDS activities inBank-sponsored activities will continue,
andeven intensify, to complement the MAP.

C. IMPLEMENT~TION

1. Partnershiparrangements

The preparation o f this project has entailed a coordination effort with several other actual and potential
donors involved in HIVIAIDS, particularly UNAIDS, the Global Fund, and the African Development
Bank which are each providing parallel financing. Arrangements have been made for the Bank to
participate inannualjoint reviewso fthe program coordinated by the ES,"AC.

The private sector is committed to playing a key role in HIVIAIDS through: (i)        prevention activities
through Information, Education, Communication (IEC) using proven market-based techniques (e.g.
partnership with the Coca-Cola Foundation); (ii)  testing through the establishment and strengthening of a
network o f laboratories that will provide testing services (e.g. Fondation Mkrietuc); (iii)voluntary
counseling and testing (VCT) through a "franchising" system where only the VCT centers which meet
certain standards can obtain the quality logo; and (iv) access to drugs leveraging pharmaceutical and
private distribution networks.

2. Institutionaland implementationarrangements

InstitutionalArrangements

Duringproject preparation, the GOMtook measures to fundamentally revise the implementationstructure
of its national HIVIAIDS strategy to bring it in line with the multi-sectoral character of the fight against
the epidemic, and the need to maximize involvement from the private sector. To achieve maximum
operational efficiency the GOM has agreed to: (i)delegate parts o f the execution of the program to
independent entities (CMA and FMA); and (ii) these entities function on the basis o f performance
                                                 have
based contractual arrangements. Whereas the execution o f the Programme de lutte contre le SIDA
(PNLS) has been centered within the Ministry o f Health, the MAP will be placed under the oversight o f
the National High Council on HIVIAIDS (HNAC) which is chaired by the Head of State. The
composition o f the HNAC has beenrevisedto include an equal number o f representatives from the public
sector, private sector and civil society. Moreover, the HNAC will consult experts and the donor
community as needed. The HNAC will meet once every six months and will be responsible for: (i)
providing advocacy, strategic direction and policy coordination to the National HIVlAIDS Strategy and
Action Plan; (ii)  mobilization of financial, human and physical resources necessary to carry out the
NationalAction Plan; and (iii) oversight andmonitoring o f the national strategy and programs responding
to the HIVlAIDSepidemic, includingthe proposed MAP.

Implementation Arrangements

The project will be managed by the Executive Secretariat o f the HNAC (ES"AC) which will ensure
the coordination o f the national HIVlAIDS control program. It will operate on the principle o f "faire-
faire" (see figure in Annex 6). The ESLHNAC will contract out procurementlcontract management as
well as financial management to independent, private agencies, in line with MAP best practices. The


                                                    10

Financial Management Agency (FMA) and the Contract Management Agency (CMA) will be under
contract with the ESHNAC to manage the day to day financial and procurement transactions o f the
project, as well as contracting with several hundredNGOs, CBOs, private entities, The financial and the
procurement officers within, the ES/H.NAC will have the responsibility o f liaising with the FMA and
C M A to make sure that they meet their obligations, prepare relevant reports for the HNAC, and provide a
bridgewith other programs fightingI-WIAIDS. Consultants will behiredfor specific issues, as needed.

Inaddition, the ESHNAC will contract withprivate sector f m s to performservices ona retainer basisin
the areas of: (i) training; (ii)financial and operational audits and monitoring and evaluation; (iii)quality
control including contracts for 'franchising' o f VCT centers, pharmacies and laboratories; and (iv) public
awareness raising. Performance-based incentives will be embedded in contracts so as to encourage
contractors to reach beyond the plannedobjectives.


A Financial Management Agency (see figure in Annex 7) will be responsible for all financial
management aspects of the project, including financial planning and budgeting, the accounting and
reporting systems and the management o f the special accounts. As part o f its contract, the FMA will be
required to develop a fully integrated financial and accounting system usingappropriate software as well
as a detailed manual of financial procedures and chart of accounts, including the format, content and
periodicity o f the various financial statements to be produced and submitted to the ESHNAC, CMA and
the Ministry o f Economy and Finance. The FMA will also be requiredto set up an appropriate financial
and accounting system at regional level.
A Contract ManagementAgency -CMA-- (see Annex 8) will be responsible for the evaluation of, and
decision makingon, all sub-project proposals, with the help o f a selection committee to be established by
the CMA. It will be in charge o f overall procurement and contract management, except for contracts
pertaining to: (i)  general supplies for the project operating needs; and (ii)fmancial and technical audits,
which will be handled by the ESlHNAC. The CMA will establish a decentralized structure by creating
three regional antennas. Sub-projects approval will be based on criteria identified in the Manual of
Procedures. Upon approval, instructions will be given to the FMA to start the payment process. Copies
of all contracts together with a summary report and minutes o f the decision meetings will be submitted
monthly for the first six months, then quarterly to the ESHNAC for ex-post control. The contract
management monitoring system established by the CMA will be linked to the FMA system to ensure
prompt payments.

ProjectImplementationManual. A ProjectImplementationManual will specify all project procedures,
institutional and implementation arrangements, the respective responsibilities and mandates o f each
participatingentity and the functional relationship between them. The manual will include flow of funds
procedures, the FMA accounting and fmancial management procedures as well as a detailed description
on how to carry out monitoring and evaluation o f all MAP supported activities. The manual will specify
the deadlines for sub-projects approval and installment payments to beneficiaries. Respect o f these
deadlines will be one o f the performance evaluation criteria for both the CMA and FMA. Preparationof
the manual is well-advanced with the support of the FPF and will bejnalized before GrantEffectiveness.

3. Monitoringand evaluation of outcomeslresults

An overall monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system (see Annex 3) will be established as part o f the
project implementation containing the following components: (i)      activity monitoring and evaluation; (ii)
monitoring o f the epidemic and its impact; and (iii)  financial monitoring of the financed action plans and
sub-projects. ES/"AC       will coordinate and ensure implementation o f the M&E system with the CMA
carrying primary responsibility for activity monitoring and the FMA for financial monitoring. Both
agencies will be requiredto put a decentralized M&Estructure inplace. Monitoring o f the epidemic will


                                                      11

be outsourced to specialized agencies. Baseline data collection for all the principal indicators will be
commissioned duringthe project start-up phase.

The daily coordination o f M&E will be in the hands of the M&E Specialist in the ES/HNAC.                This
specialist will be responsible for consolidating progress reports, organizing annual program reviews, the
mid-term review and the program completion review to assess the performance of the program, its
components and its contribution to the national strategic goal o f reducing the spread and impact of
HIVIAIDS.

Audit Arrangements

To obtain reasonable assurance that project funds are used efficiently and for the intended purpose, the
following audit arrangements will be put in place (see Annex 7). The project accounts and financial
statements for all components will be audited in accordance with international audit standards by an
independent auditing firm under terms o f reference that have been approved by IDA. The auditor will
provide opinions onthe project financial statements, the Special Accounts and Statement of Expenditures.
The auditor will also be required to carry out a comprehensive review o f the internal control procedures
and provide a report outlining any recommendations for their improvement. The auditors report will be
submitted to IDA not later than six months after the end o f each fiscal year. A financial and technical
audit of sub-projects will also be carried out by the auditor on a selected basis to determine whether
eligibility criteria and other decision making procedures have been respected and whether project funds
have beenused efficiently and for the intended purpose.

An audit committee will be formed as a sub-committee to the HCNLS. Members ofthis audit committee
will includea representative o fthe Ordredes Experts Comptables,the Ministry o fEconomy andFinance,
and a beneficiary association member o f the HCNLS. The role o f the audit committee is to facilitate the
external auditor's work, review and ensure the implementation o f the recommendations o f the auditor,
andact ontheir findings.

4. Sustainability

 The sustainability o f the fight against HTVIAIDS is contingent to the quality o f institutional realignment
that the GOM is making in the context o f project preparation. Inthe recently adopted policy paper, the
GOM confirmed the strategic nature o f the fight against HIVIAIDS, thus engaging a multi-sectoral
approach under the leadership of the Head o f State. In addition to a participatory process, the new
institutional arrangements will be inclusive and representative o f the public sector, the private sector and
the civil society. All these stakeholders have ownership of the proposed project as they have been key
players at every stage o f its preparation.       c


Other factors that are critical to sustainability are: (i) GOM's commitment to adequate fundingfrom
                                                         the
the budget of free ARV access for HIVIAIDS infected people and of other HIVlAIDS activities once the
projects come to an end; (ii)    the strengthening of the health system so that it can provide the needed
support to the fight against HIVlAIDS; and (iii)    the ability o fthe Maliansociety to addressissues that are
not, prima faciae, directly relatedto HTVlAIDS such as cultural factors o f gender inequities,

The project design has attempted to address these factors by: (i)highlightingthe future financial effort
that the Government will have to deploy in order to meet the challenge in the medium term; (ii)
contributing to the strengthening o f the health system by providing support to the public system and
promotingthe private provision o f healthservices; and(iii)     engaging the various sections o fthe society in
addressingcultural issues that are not consistent with the objective o f fightingHTVIAIDS.

  5. Critical risks and possiblecontroversialaspects

 The main risk that may affect the achievement of the project's development objective is a lack of clear
 leadership and long-term commitment to the program. Although the GOM has recently demonstrated
 clear leadership by changing the institutional set-up o f the fight against HlVIAIDS and has brought its
  responsibility directly under the Presidency, this effort needs to be sustained. The choice o f the people
 who will lead the Executive Secretariatwill be critical to mitigate this risk.

  With respect to the public sector response, the critical risk is, for the moment, the weak ability of the
  health system to respond to the needs of the program. For example, the private sector is ready to step up
  its engagement inthe fight against HIVIAIDS but it requires a well functioning health system to which it
 can refer their employees.

 As regards the private sector response, the risk is that, even though larger firms are ready to play a
 significant role in the fight against HIVIAIDS, there is a risk that SMEs have not yet reached the same
  level o f concern nor have the capacity to initiate HIVIAIDSprograms.

 The mainrisks and possible controversial aspects relatedto the civil society are: (i)possible reluctance
                                                                                        a
 of both Islamic and Christian churches to the use of condoms to fight HIVIAIDS; and (ii)a need to
 change the cultural traditions that require young women and men to marry husbands and wives of
  deceasedrelatives.

  provides an indicationo fthe measures to mitigate these risks:

D. APPRAISALSUMMARY

1. Economicandfinancialanalyses

A simple model has been created to estimate the potential short, mediumand long term economic effects
o f the MAP in Mali. Detailed results are presented in Annex 9. The project is expected to contribute,
among others, to reducing the outputlincome losses due to depletion of human capital as the results o f
death and other impediments related to the disease. It would also contribute to contain the expansion o f
the epidemic. At the end of the 30-year projection timeframe, the HIV prevalence rate increased to 2.34
percent (up from 1.7 percent in2001). This results not only from the MAP but also from the GOM' s and
other donors' continued support to the HIVIAIDS program throughout the project implementation
timeframe and beyond. Without this joint effort, the HIV prevalence rate could reach 31 percent in 30
years. These results confirm the project's soundness.

With respect to the fiscal impact, it should be stressed that intervening preemptively by providing free
access to ARVs would considerably reduce tax losses (that would have resulted from the increased
number o f deaths and declining productivity from infected people in a "without project" scenario), It is
therefore essential to improve access to drugs not only to improve the welfare o f the affected population
but also for macroeconomic stability. However, sustainability of free access to ARV can be ensuredonly
under continued GOM support (budget allocation) to the program as well as comprehensive and well
coordinated external assistance. To illustrate, the MAP is expected to provide support to 2,250 patients3
medically in need of ARV duringthe first year of project implementation. This number will increase at a
yearly average rate o f 59 percent to reach 9,000 patients by 2007. The same number o f patients will be
supported in 2008. Overall, for the 5-year timeframe, the cost o f providing free ARVs by the MAP is
estimated at US$4,5 million4equivalent, excluding the delivery cost. Resources to cover this cost will
needto be mobilized after project closing to ensure sustainability o ffree access to the treatment.

Financialanalysis

Paragraph 79 o f the project appraisal document for the Multi-country HIV/AIDS Program for the Africa
Region(Report No 20727 AFR) states that, (`for each o f the physical work components, the operationand
maintenance (O&M) costs will be calculated and commitment required from Government to finance and
carry out effective O&M on annual basis". The project does not plan any major works. Furthermore,
with a large portion o f the resources directed at the private sector and civil society organizations, the
fiscal impact o f the project is mainly limited to the provision of drugs. Great attention will be paid to
actions directed at improving financial management mechanisms agreed upon between Government and
IDA to accelerateresourceflows to beneficiaries,

2. Technical

Duringthe project preparation, the team has carriedout a thorough discussion oftechnical issues that are
relevant to the project. These include the preparation o f the sensitization toolkits, the testing facilities and


  Currently, only 6 percentof the patients inneedoftreatment (1,073) have accessto ARVs. The 9,000 that the
MAPproposesto coverwill contributeto increasingthe coveragerate.

the provision of ARVs and other drugs. The design incorporates the best international practices for
HIVlAIDS responses as developed within the context of the MAP and is consistent with UNAIDS
guidance on HIVlAIDS indevelopingcountries.

After consulting with various stakeholders, the MAPproject builds on the internationalrecommendations
made in the reference document entitled: "Sources et prix d'une se`lection de me`dicaments et tests
dia~nostique~pour          les   personnes    vivant     avec    le   VIH/SIDA", CopenhagenlGeneva,
U N A I D S ~ I C E F ~ H O - H T P ~ June, 2003 for unit prices o f lowest cost medicines, particularly the
                                        S F
ARV. The GOM intends to submit an application to the Clinton Initiative to benefit from low ARV
prices. The communication campaign for behavior change will leverage specific expertise of the private
sector so as to increasethe effectiveness ofthe message.

Under the proposed project, quality control will be ensured through the involvement o f the National
Institute of Public Health Research.       This institute will leverage the expertise o f the "MBrieuxyy
Foundationfor all actions pertainingto testing, biological surveillance, andcapacity building.

In addition, all issues related to quality control of drugs and reagents will involve the Direction de la
Pharmacie et du Mkdicament and the Laboratoire ~ationalde la Sante`         -inordertoensurecompliance
with regulations as well as with sale authorization requirements (A~toris~tionde mise sur le marche` -
AMM).

3. Fiduciary

Procurementissues

Procurement capacities are still fraught with structural weaknesses. While the Government has taken a
series o f actions to address the issues identified in the 1998 Country Procurement Assessment Review
(CPAR), Mali still needs to step up its efforts to strengthen its overall procurement capacity. An updated
CPAR is currently under way and it is focusing on the actions required for the Government to strengthen
its systems and to move towards a generalized budgetary support operating mode. In order to allow a
swift implementation of the proposed MAP by increasing the responsiveness to multiple implementation
agencies (public sector, private sector and civil society), an agreement was reached with the Government
to outsource most o fthe procurement work to a Contract Management Agency (CMA).

The project will be implemented by different actors and, as such, particular attention will be given to
ensure that these actors comply with IDA Guidelines for Procurement. Therefore, activities under the
project will be carried out in accordance with IDA'SGuidelines for procurement under IBRD loans and
IDA credits dated May 2004, in particular, Section 3.15, "Community participation in procurement".
Consulting services will be awarded inaccordancewith the IDA'SGuidelines: Selection and Employment
of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers datedMay 2004.

Procurement performance o f the various implementing actors will be assessed after one year o f
implementation, The ES/HNAC will use the services o f a CMA, which will have a regional presence to
ensure responsivenessto the requests o f various actors throughout the country. The procurement officer
within the ESI"AC      will be responsible for monitoring the implementation o f the CMA's contract, to
prepare the reports to the HNAC, and to bridge to other programs related to HIV/AIDS beyondthe MAP
on this matter.

Financialmanagement issues

Recent financial management capacity assessment carried out in Mali concluded that a number o f
weaknesses still need to be addressed to ensure sound management o f funds. While progress has been


                                                      15

made since the 2002 Country Financial Accountability Assessment, several ministries stilf have very
weak capacity that hampers the pace o f project implementation; hence a need to leverage the private
sector capacity for an acceleratedservice delivery inthe context o fthis MAP.

A key decision that has been already taken in the case o f Mali is the use o f a FMA. The FMA will
maintain a network o f three regional offices representing zone 1 (Bamako, Koulikoro and Kayes), zone 2
(Sikasso, Segou and Mopti), and zone 3 (Tombouctou, Gao and Kidal). This is in line with the
recommendationo f IDA, basedon the evaluation o f the MAP 1projects. The recruitment will be done on
a competitive basis, The completionof this process is a condition o f Effectiveness.

It is proposed that the project will have two Special Accounts: one for the ES/HNAC, and a second,
maintained by the FMA, for the public sector, private sector and the civilsociety responses.

The Government o f Mali has sent a letter to the Bank, dated February 19, 2004, indicating that there will
be no taxes on any activity related to the MAP. In order to accelerate the implementation o f the project,
and given that the Government is already putting 1.2 billion CFAF in the provision of drugs, it is
proposed that there be no counterpart fundingrequirement for this project.

Disbursements of IDA funds to the beneficiary will be based on statement of expenditures for the first
year and, contingent to project readiness, they will be done based on Financial Monitoring Reports
(FMRs) that integrate financial reporting, procurement and contract management with physical
implementation progress afterwards.

4. Social

Key social issues pertaining to gender and youth vulnerability, stigmatization of PLWHA and affected
persons (widows, orphans and other vulnerable children), traditional beliefs which contribute to higher
HIV infection, juvenile promiscuity, major legal issues related to inheritance rights, women's rights to
property, and rights pertainingto other specific populations will be taken into consideration inthe course
o f project implementation, and synergy with other programs addressing these issueswill be leveraged.

The project was prepared in a participatory manner and the implementation phase will sustain this
inclusive mode, An extensive participatory process involvingNGOs and community-based organizations
i s being used to understand underlying causes o f these problems and identifying efficient and well
targeted ways of dealing with them under the project. The preparation o f the national strategic plan has
involved all stakeholders (public and private sectors representatives, and civil society representatives
including PLWHA), and they are now not only expected to implement their own part o f the project, but
also to participate inthe policy-making through their representation inthe HNAC. Consultations with all
stakeholders will be sustainedat each critical stage o f project implementation, monitoring and evaluation.
The list o fthe stakeholders consulted duringproject preparationispresented inAnnex 17.

5. Environment

Environmentalcategory: B

This project falls under environmental category B. A medical waste management plan was prepared by
the Government and reviewed by IDA. Its quality and content are satisfactory; and the report has been
disclosed in the country and in the World Bank's Infoshop. The project is not expected to have
substantial adverse environmental effects, The environmental risks pointed out by the report include
particularly: (i)the inappropriate handling and disposal o f medical waste by untrained staff; (ii)the
inadequate management o f the respective disposal sites in urban or peri-urban areas where domestic and
medical waste are often mixed; and (iii)  disposal o f some waste on open sites to which anyone can easily


                                                     16

have access and manipulate waste with no safe precautions. The plan that has been prepared proposes
measures to mitigate these potential risks, including clear institutional arrangements to implement and
monitor those measures. The plan also includes a costed awareness and capacity building fiamework to
effectively implement the plan, and an implementation schedule.

The action plan proposed by the Medical Waste Management Plan includes four main provisions: (i)
adoption o f a sound policy for medical waste management; (ii)reorganization o f the legal framework
with the enactment o f proper laws and decrees; (iii) launching of awareness campaigns to sensitize the
general population, health care workers, dump site managers, incinerator operators and CSOs; and (iv)
development of training programs for healthcare professionals and community workers delivering care to
HIVlAIDS patients. This training will include instruction on appropriate separation, transport, and
disposal o f hazardous medical waste. The project will finance a series o f priority actions inthe amount o f
approximately US$942,000 equivalent. The environmental benefits will be monitored by independent
experts commissioned by the ESI"AC,     with the involvemento fthe Ministryo fEnvironment.

For CategoryA and Bprojects, timeline and status of EA:

 Date o f receipt o f final draft:               4/02/2004

The Medical Waste Management Plan was prepared inclose consultation with the Unito f the Ministryof
Health responsible for medical waste management oversight, the managers and staff of health facilities,
municipalities garbage collectionmanagers andjanitors' supervisors, community leaders, hotel managers,
mass transportation managers, private health facility managers, managers o f industrial plants and SMEs,
regional and secondary town municipal administrators, NGOs working on sanitation matters, and
environmental groups, as well as the general public. A national workshop endorsed the report and its
recommendation onMarch30,2004.

The policy triggered by the proposed project is the one on environmental assessment (OP4.01, BP 4.01,
GP 4.01). On this basis, the medical waste management plan discussed in the previous section was
prepared in compliance with OP 4.01 and has been reviewed and judged satisfactory by the Bank's
Safeguard Policies Unit (ASPEN). Clearance has been granted by ASPEN and the Medical Waste
Management Plan was disclosed in-country andat the World Bank InfoShop prior to appraisal.


7. Policy Exceptions and Readiness

Policy Expectations

The project does not call for any exception fiom Bank policies. The Government hasrecently adopted the
policy paper providing the framework for a strategic and multi-sectoral approach to fighting HIVIAIDS.
On this basis, it is expected that the Government will finalize the 2005-2010 strategic action plan by the
end o f CY2004.

Readiness for Implementation

1.The procurement documents for the first year's activities are complete and ready for the start of project
implementation.

2. The Government has prepared a draft Project ImplementationPlanand its finalization is a condition of
Effectiveness.

                                     Multi-Sectoral HIV/AIDS Project

Relation to the CAS and the PRSP. The FY04-06 CAS, which was discussedby the Board on July 31,
2003 and which is basedon Mali's PRSP, has three mainthemes: (i)         PromotingGrowth; (ii)  Developing
Human Resources; and (iii)    Public Finance Management and Governance. With respect to (ii), CAS  the
identifies the reversal ofthe spreado f HIVlAIDS as one of the key development objectives and proposes
a Multi-Sectoral HIVlAIDS project to support this goal. This project, which is provided for inthe CAS
base case scenario, will encourage and pulltogether sectoral efforts, and put inplace programs incritical
sectors such as agriculture, education, transport, mining, the army, etc.,.
Economy and poverty, Mali remains one of the world's poorest countries rated 1721'175        in 2003 in the
UNDP Human Development Index. In 2001, 63.8 percent o f the population was estimated to be living
below the poverty line. On this basis, poverty was estimated to affect 75.9 percent o f the rural population
and 30.1 percent o f the urban population. Life expectancy at birthwas 41 years in2002. The poor are less
likely to use health services, particularly the rural poor, and tend to spend proportionately less on health
care. The 2001 demographic and health survey confirms that health behaviors are influenced by the
mother's education level and accessto basic services and information.

HIVMDS, In its 2002 PRSP, Mali identified HIVlAIDS as a development issue requiring high level
attention to keep the epidemic under control. The Government developed a National Strategy for the
period 2001-2005 and is currently preparingan extension o f this strategy to cover the 2005-2010 period.
The main responsibility for fighting HIVlAIDS has been transferred from the Ministry o f Health to the
Presidency o f the Republic, an acknowledgement o fthe highest importance given to the epidemic as well
as the need for an inter-sectoral approach. In April 2004, the Government adopted a Letter o f Sector
Policy that emphasizes the commitment to a multi-sector approach to fighting HIVlAIDS and that
modifies the institutional framework to enhance implementation and likelihood o f impact. Moreover,
HIPC money has been usedfor HIVIAIDS activities inthe past three years.

According to the 2001 demographic and health survey the overall prevalence rate of HIVlAIDS is
estimated at 1,7 percent with 170,000 people living with HIVlAIDS and 45,000 HIVlAIDS orphans. It is
estimated that, ifspecific, vigorous and sustainable actions are not taken, in2010 Mali will have 500,000
people living with HIVIAIDS, 170,000 deaths, 150,000 orphans, and a life expectancy reduced by six
years. A large portion o fthe population do not perceive HIVIAIDS as a threat to their life becausethey do
not recognize its symptoms and its manifestationlike other diseases such as malaria. A number o f factors
- which  are present in Mali - contribute to the spread o f HIV: inadequate knowledge and inappropriate
attitudes, sexuality at an early age, high prevalence o f risky behavior, importance o f miningand trucking
activities, subordinate status and lack o f empowerment among women, fluid populationmovements inthe
western Africa sub-region due to the crisis in C8te d'Ivoire, Sierra Leone and Liberia and the limited
availability o f HIVlAIDS-related services inMali.

The project seeks to protect the foundations o f development --namely economic growth, good
governance, development o f human capital, the investment climate, and labor productivity-- from being
undermined by the HIVlAIDS epidemic, Existingstudies suggest that HIVlAIDS is costing the typical
Sub-Saharan African country more than half a percent o f per capita growth every year, with a risk o f
being even higher. Considering that annual per capita growth in Mali has recently been about 5 percent
for 1994-2002, this is a loss the country cannot afford. Also, the impact o f high HIVIAIDS prevalence
would hit on the labor force both in the public and private sectors. In the public sector, the risk is a
depletion of the already scarce supply o f qualified policy makers and civil servants, thus weakening the
prospects for good governance. In the private sector, the loss o f productivity and o f skilled labor would
undermine Mali's competitiveness potential, raise the costs of doing business and deter investment, Inthe

                                                      19

rural area, the death o f farmers duringthe rainy season can affect crop production and reduce income and
availability o f food. The inflow o fmigrants, truck drivers and their apprentices from Cote d'Ivoire, which
has a HIVlAIDS prevalence o f 10 percent, may increase the risk o f spreading HIVIAIDS particularly in
the region of Sikasso which is close to the border with C6te d'Ivoire and which is the main area of
agricultural production in Mali. This risk means that both cash crops (cotton) and food crops (sorghum,
millet, maize) could be seriously affected. Due to its long incubation period (7-10 years), the impact of
the HIVlAIDS epidemic is likely to be felt over time with the rate o f growth of physical and human
capital and the efficiency of social capital declining slowly inparallel with the maturing of the HIVlAIDS
epidemic.

Ona strategic level, it is recognized that fightingHIVlAIDS is a development challenge for Mali and not
just a health sector challenge. HIVlAIDS inMali is a complex and multi-faceted development problem
requiring long-term sustained and broad-based responses involving virtually all levels and sectors of
Government and society. In particular, the objectives o f fighting HIVIAIDS link closely to the mandate
o f the Bank which is to fight poverty through supporting economic growth, good governance,
development o f humancapital, andenhancing the investment climate and labor productivity,

Finally, HIVlAIDS targets the poor disproportionately. While people of all classes are vulnerable to HIV,
it is the poor who suffer the most economically and socially. Also, because HIVlAIDS has a severe
impact on health and education, it deprives the poor of these two most important assets which they can
use to bringthemselves from poverty to prosperity.

Government Strategy

The interventions proposed inthe PRSPto fightthe spreado fHIV are basedonthe National Strategic
Plan for 2001-2005 which lays out the followingpriorities:
                                                  _ _
         Decentralizationo fthe HIVlAIDSprogramanddevelopment o fthe local responsesand o f
         partnerships with grassroots implementing entities;
         Systematic inclusiono f STDs inall community and district healthcenters;
         Widening the national responseto sectors other than health bymeans o f an integrated multi-
         sectoral approach;
         Taking account o fthe HIVlAIDSepidemic andits impact at places o f work;
         Continuation o f strategies which have proveneffective: information, education and
         communicationo fthe populationingeneral, promotion o f condom use through advertising,
         concentration on the most vulnerable groups o fthe population inorder to bringabout a change in
         risky sexual practices;
         Control of Hnr transmission through blood inthe healthcare system;
         Promotion o f advice and voluntary screening;
         Increased access to anti-retroviral therapy;
         Improvement inthe health information system for HIVlAIDSand STDs.

Sector specific issues

1.I ~ p l e ~ e ~ taj Multi-SectoralandMulti-ActorApproach
                      n g

As indicated above, the limited effectiveness of previous efforts to fight HIVlAIDSstems from the fact
that the responsehas primarily been framed as a health issue, andthat the institutional framework has had
neither the ability nor the leverage to trigger the neededstrong actions. As a result o fthis lesson learnt,
the GOM has chosen to scale up activities for fighting HIVlAIDS in a more multi-sectoral and
comprehensive manner. The program involves three main actors - Government, private sector and
NGOsl (CBOs include women's groups, religious organizations, etc.. .) Through the MAP, these actors
will be more readily able to tap financial resources and technical support in order to ensure timely and

                                                      20

flexible response. The GOM is committed to promoting and encouraging the participation o f private
sector enterprises and their federated organizations in implementing the national strategy, including
supporting the private sector in providing prevention and treatment services to their employees and their
families. Innovative financial and administrative mechanisms for channeling resources eficiently to
beneficiaries will also be undertaken to ensure greater efficiency inthe delivery of services. The proposed
institutional arrangements offer the combined benefits o f increasing the potential effectiveness o f the
actions o f multipleactors against HIVIAIDSand strengthening the Ministry o f Health in its core business
of maintaining a good health network and enforcing the sectoral quality o f care, in conformity with
national and internationalstandards.

2. IntensifyingActivities at the GrassrootsLevel

Community involvement is fundamental for an effective HIVIAIDS campaign. Community, civil society,
and private sector activities are needed to support prevention as well as care o f those infected and
affected. Such efforts empower communities to heighten the awareness level o f their risk o f HIVIAIDS,
fight discriminationagainst individuals infectedandlor affectedby the H.IV virus, andcan be an incentive
for individuals to seek preventionand care services when needed. Despite their weak capacity, the NGO
sector in Mali has been involved in the fight against WNIAIDS, often launching activities which are
planned to be scaled-up by the MAP, Malian grassroots-level communities have long-standing, solid
rural and urban community-based organizations spread all over the country.                 However, these
organizations need strengthened managementcapacity and must be better integrated into the fight against
HIVIAIDS. The MAP will focus on capacity-building o fNGOs, FBOs, and CBOs, and will allocate the
larger share o f the funds to their community-driven responses to HIVIAIDS. Strong emphasis will be
placedon home-basedcare and counseling o f bothpatients and families.

To address the issue o f timely funding o f grassroots activities, Mali has decided to contract out the
processing o f grant requests and related disbursementson a competitive basis to a private sector Financial
Management Agency. This agency is also responsible for ensuringefficient partnerships with civil society
inorder to transfer and buildlocaltrainingand delivery capacity at the grassrootslevel.

3. EnsuringAdequate Treatment,Careand Support

The burden of care and support for PLWHA and their families has largely fallen on the extended family,
usually poor, eroding their already limitedmeans and preventing them from obtaining the education and
employment opportunities needed to escape poverty. As a result, an important element in Mali's
HIVIAIDS strategy is alleviation o f some o fthe financial burdens o f over-extended families by providing
care for those who are sick, as well as by counseling and support services. To date, access to drugs
remains extremely limitedand inmost parts o f the country simply absent due to issues o f availability and
affordability which are compounded by the lack o f adequate monitoring capability and systems. Under
the new HTVIAIDSprogram, the GOM has decided to make unlimited access to anti-retroviral therapy
(ARV)a corner stone o fits strategy of containment.

4. Addressing WeakInstitutional Capad&

The intensificationo fthe preventioneffort andthe introduction o fpatient and family support services will
require significant capacity strengthening and coordination o f the different institutions, actors, services
and systems, notably:

     a   systems and procedures for channeling funds more efficiently to the grassroots;
     a   developingcapacity through acceleratedtraining o f technicians inthe areas o fVCT (especially
         for pregnant women), ART, treatment o f opportunistic infections and STDs, procedures to ensure
         safe blood supplies andthe safe handlingo f medical waste;


                                                     21

         partnershipswithin the civil society to strengthen and develop localcapacity to deliver prevention
         and care at a decentralized level;
     e   monitoring and evaluation, which becomes more complex as a result o f greater grassroots
         involvement;
     e   procurement of drugs, testing kits and related services to ensurethat regional and district services
         are supplied efficiently andontime.

5. Focusingon Spect@icVulnerableGroupsandSectors

The MAP program is designed to target those population groups which are considered to be particularly
vulnerable or at-risk. These include:

     e   Youth, aged 15 to 19, whose numbers will increase dramatically through 2010, Educating them
         about disease transmission and protection, and raising the average age o f the first sexual
         encounter are the highest priorities in terms o f containment. To be effective, this group must be
         reached inthe last years o f primary school, before sexual activity begins. Specific activities must
         also be developed for those who have dropped out o fthe education system;

     0   Women, who are particularly vulnerable because o f the cultural aspects o f marriage (described
         above), health risks related to genital cutting, their generally low health status and their low rate
         o f literacy;

     0   Transport workers (truckers, bus drivers, taxi drivers) have the mobility and the income to make
         them natural vectors for HIV transmission,          Moreover, investments by the Government and
         donors in improving the road network in Mali are likely to attract not only extra travelers and
         transporters but settlements, trading facilities and commercial sex workers, all o f which will
         increasethe spread of HNlAIDS.

     e   Other vulnerable groups such as sex workers and people in uniform. Most commercial sex
         workers practice unsafe sex. Moreover, highpoverty levels inMali contribute to prostitution. As
         with many other countries inSub-SaharanAfrica, military personnel andother people inuniform
         are also at highrisko f HIV/AIDS due to entrenched behavior patterns andhighmobility.


6. ContinuedImportantRolefor Mali's Health Sector in theFightAgainst HIV/AIDS

The health sector in Mali has unique responsibilities and expertise. First, this sector is responsible for
specific aspects such as epidemiological oversight, preparation and supervision o f treatment, protocols,
testing, managemento f the blood supply system, quality assuranceand provision o f drugs for HIV/AIDS,

their availability, quality, and affordability. Health personnel (nurses, midwives, doctors, laboratory
STIs, and other opportunistic infections. It is the supplier of such services, products, or both, assuring

technicians, pharmacists) needto be proficient inhow to provide such services, and counselingrelated to
these services, products, or both. They should also support other sectors to offer simple medical care,
amongst others, for PLWAs and assure that national standards are followed. Second, in Mali facilities
serve as referral units for other sectors, NGOs, the private sector, and communities. Third, health
personnel must become key allies in the fight against HIV/AIDS, in its prevention, treatment, and care
dimensions. Health services will not only have to perform their customary service supply functions, but
also welcome and helppatients referredby others.

The World Bank and other donors are providing resources, through the PRODESS, to support the health
sector to fulfill its core functions; and the activities financedunder the MAP will help expand the network
o f service providers andcontributeto capacity strengthening for better service delivery.

                                    Multi-Sectoral HIVlAIDS Project


There are severalBank financedprojectswhich implementactivities relatedto HIVIAIDS:

    0    The rural developmentproject (PASAOP) -PO35630                   D.O. rating= S
    0    The national rural infrastructureprogram(PNIR) -PO41723          D.0.rating=S
    0    The educationsectorproject (PRODEC) -PO40650                     D.O. rating = S

         The transport corridors improvementproject-PO79351               D.O. rating = S

The essence ofthe proposedactions inthose projects is mainly about raising awareness about HIVIAIDS,
undertaking some HIVIAIDS prevention activities and mitigating project-specific risks of HIVIAIDS
(such as risksthat could arise amongworkers onroadconstruction activities).

A special feature of the PRODESS is the support to the HIVIAIDS initiative "Initiative un Cercle, une
ONG" (ICONG), This initiative, begun in 2001, fosters contractual relations between MOH and 130
NGOs to strengthen local responses to HIVIAIDS. It currently faces several challenges, including
disbursement problems and accountability of funding. At the moment, only 18 districts (Cercles) have an
operational NGO. One strength of Mali's health system is that it now counts 665 Community Health
Centers(CSCOM) which are fully managed by community health associations (ASACO), making Mali's
experience unique in the west African region in terms of community participation in the financing,
planning, budgeting, monitoring and evaluation of health interventions in their health catchment's area.
There are regional federations (FERASCOM) and a national federation (FENASCOM) which are co-
sharing the decision bodies of the PRODESS. This project which became effective in July 1999, will
close inDecember2005, andas oftoday ithas disbursedonly halfo fthe project's funds, thus there is still
US$20 million to use before closing. Since 2003, the PASAOP trained 30 HIVIAIDS trainers, 2,457
workers, and 26 radio commentators, tested community-based distribution of condoms in 25 villages,
designed a training module for the Ministry of Agriculture personnel, and promoted HIVIAIDS
preventionthrough radio spots.

The proposedMAP will leverage actions engaged under the above projects and expandthose prevention
efforts. In addition, it will address issues pertaining to testing and counseling, as well as treatment and
care. EachMinistry will develop its sectoralplanandthe MAPwill complementany funding necessary,

The table below resents the expected fmancial contributions from major multilateral agencies for the
period 2004-2009 which are contributingto the fight against W I A I D S . Itshould be emphasizedthat the
                    P
GOM has also submitted a request to the Global Fund. The amount requested is based on the existing
capacities o f the country; it is not yet secured and does not cover all the needs o f the country which are
still to be fully assessed. This request will be evaluated by the Global Fund's selection committee in the
coming months. The agencies listed in the table are expected to have targeted interventions mainly in
their areas of specialization. Examples are: Info~atio~ducatio~Communication Prevention of and
Mother-to-Child transmission for UNICEF, and psycho-social care for WFP.

In order to ensure effective implementation of the project, a sound monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
system will be put inplace. The M&Esystem will entail: (i)        epidemiological surveillance and research;
(ii)surveys inparticulartomonitorbehavioralchangeamongtargetedgroups; and(iii)                  financial and
technical aspects o f programmanagement,


With respect to the epidemic-related M&E, it will be done by national biological and behavioral
surveillance of HIVIAIDS, STIs and opportunistic infections such as TB. The MAP will support Mali in
carrying out every 2-3 years, a survey combining biomedical and behavioral surveillance, targeted to
vulnerable groups. Smaller surveys mightbe neededinbetween as the ES/HNAC will undertake a yearly
evaluation of its program.
Activity M&E. Giventhe program's large scope of interventions and decentralized nature of activities, it
will be necessaryto incorporate a coherent and consistent set o f indicators into all contracts funded by the
project. For example, line ministrieswill be required to submit their sectoral plans following the logical
framework outline linkinginputs, process, outputs with outcome and impact indicators.


Moreover, technical and financial M&E will be exercised periodically. Activities on all levels will
be monitored using structured reporting and assessment forms and procedures. Performance indicators
will be part o f funding agreements. Actual implementationperformance indicators will be compiled and
aggregatedinthe annual report o fthe HNAC. Financial management M&Ewill be done of the utilization
o f resources and funds by the various grant beneficiaries financial information will be cross checked with
actual activity data on a periodic basis so as to establish a relationshipbetween disbursements and service
delivery.


With respect to M&EReports, the followingwill be produced:

     a  Annual HIVIAIDS M&E Report: The purpose o f this report is to provide a comprehensive
        overview o f Mali's response to HIVIAIDS. This will be done by reporting on all indicators
        contained in the M&E system; and each report is expected to provide guidance for hture
        improvements. Since Mali is a signatory to the 2001 Declaration o f Commitment at the United
        Nations Special Session on HIVIAIDS (UNGASS), the M&E report will be based in the set o f
        indicators that the Government o f Mali has agreed to report on to UNAIDS on a periodic basis.
        Therefore, this report will serve two purposes at once, i.e. providing the bi-annual updates on
        Mali's progress in the fight against AIDS to both UNGASS and the World Bank using the 12
        specific indicators definedinthe UNAIDS Guidelinesfor the Construction o f Core Indicators. All
         12 UNGASS indicators have been taken into consideration in developing the results framework
        for the Mali MAP so as to ensure that the data collection andanalysis for the UNGASS indicators
        be inline with the M&Erequirementsunder the proposedproject. The in-country UNAIDS office
        is expected to provide technical assistanceto the National Executive Secretariat o fthe HNAC for
        the productionofthis M&Ereport.


     e  Quarterly Service Coverage Report:The purpose o f this report is to provide a quick overview
        o f service coverage in the previous quarter to better inform implementers and financiers o f
        interventions, o f where gaps are, and how to maximize resource utilization.

                             Annex 4: Detailed Project Description
                               Multi-Sectoral HIVIAIDSProject

This project is articulated around three main interventions: prevention and sensitization,
counseling and testing, and access to treatment and care. These three interventions will be
executed simultaneously within the four components: (i) to the public sector; (ii)
                                                           support                       support
to the private sector; (iii)
                          support to civilsociety; and(iv) managemen~monitorin~evaluation.

Firsttype ofintervention: prevention andsensitization

As the GOMhas decided to provide free ARV treatment to HrlAIDS sufferers, it is importantto
have a good communication strategy on prevention, testing and treatment. The MAPwill finance
the design o f a national communication strategy to help the whole population understand what
this national endeavor means for them, This strategy will be based on the cultural norms and
social values o f Mali. Opinion leaders from the public, private andNGO sectors, as well as from
communities, will be targeted to ensure maximum mobilization. This will be done through
modern media such as TV and radio but also through more traditional media such as theatres and
"griots". Religious leaders, local traditional leaders, elected officials, and heads o f local
associations will all betargeted.

Several pilot programs will be conducted to improve access to condoms among highrisk groups,
which will be accompanied by sensitization activities from local groups. The objective i s to
change behavior.

Local associations need to be strengthened either through networks they belong to or directly.
Capacity strengthening in communication will be implemented through a kind o f `franchising'
system where the organizations which meet a certain standard receive a logo from the
`franchiser'. Such a franchising system provides quality control, training, supervision, and data
collection inorder to maintaina highquality o f service.

Second type of intervention: counselingand testing

Fifteen anonymous centers for counseling and testing exist in Bamako, Segou, Mopti, Kayes,
Sikasso and Tombouctou. The MAP will finance 55 reference health centers (at the District -
Cercle- and Commune levels), and 400 CSCOMs so they can offer sensitization, testing and
counseling services by 2009. The expansion will be based on a mapping exercise in order for
these centers to be located near treatment centers. The whole country will be covered by 2009.
Coordination will be ensured through a network which will include public, private and NGO
centers under the leadership o f one or two `franchiser' organizations who will ensure the quality
control, training, data collection and supervision, and will deliver the logo accordingly. A
behavior study will be carried out at the beginningo f the projectto get baseline data.

The objective ofthese centers isto change behavior, andmore specifically:
         a. to increaseacceptance o ftestingthroughout the country;
         b. to promotea referral systembetween public and private entities from counselingand
             testingto ARV treatment;
         c. to promote strategiesfor prevention of stigmatization anddiscrimination.

     Support labeling and accreditation mechanisms (((MEL or MELA),), this type of
     organization buildingon the "faire-faire" concept, is set-up invarious areas o f the MAP in
     order to ensure success o f implementation and quality for activities. The terms of
     reference for such accreditation systems are as follows: technical assistance for national and
     international standards, implementation monitoring and scaling up, supervision, data
     collection and feedback notificationto the epidemiological facility, training, capitalizingand
     valuing o f best practices, financial sustainability andcost effectiveness analysis.

The nationalreference laboratory is the INRSP which, along with the future Merieux Foundation
laboratory, will provide the control and quality o f serological tests.

Third type of intervention:access to treatment and care

InJanuary 2004, only 1,073 patients were receivingtriple-therapy out of 170,000 HIV+ people,
o f which about 10percent are estimated to be eligible for treatment, or 17,000 people. The project
will improve the capacity to care for the 170,000 PLWHA. More than 9,000 o f those PLWHA
will receive ARV therapy bythe endo f2007 throughthe MAP. Interventionswill mainly consist
o f putting in place a continuum o f activities startingwith promotion o f voluntary testing, testing
and counseling, offered by public and private entities which take care o f opportunistic infections
and STIs. ARV treatment will be provided as close to where the patient lives as possible, while
such treatment is now available only in the capital. Psychosocial support will be provided by
NGOsspecialized inthis areathrough performance-based contracts.

Starting with pre-natal visits, pregnant women will be provided information and offered voluntary
testing, those services will be integrated into the prenatal care package, Eighty percent o f HTV+
women will be provided with ARV prophylaxis and treatment for PTMT. It is expected that
around 1,000 women out o f the estimated 5,500 HIV+ pregnant women will benefit from the
extension of the MTCT program financed by the MAP.All those services will be provided at the
Community Health Center (CSCOM) levelto take advantage o f the first prenatal visits. A total of
400 CSCOMwill be covered through the MAP.

The MAP will ensure that drug procurement and distribution suffer no problems to respect the
principle o f proximity by establishing partnership with the public, private and not-for-profit
sectors. The GOM will initiate a partnership with the Bill Clinton foundation to obtain better
ARV prices,

Eachyear, at least thirty `mediatorslcounselors' from civil society will be trained and paid by the
project to work with health professionals to help work with AIDS patients in and outside the
hospital.

The extension of services will follow a mapping exercise which provides nine regional reference
centers for comprehensive treatment and care which are financed by the Global Fund.The MAP




                                                  33

will finance interventions at the community levelto help identify PLWHAs, to sensitize them so
they accept treatment and care, so they will utilize the District reference centers.

All the actors from the public, private or NGO sectors will be trained. Specific training modules
will be developed ifthey are not yet available. Partnerships will be initiated to reinforce
capacities and put in common training modules and techniques between the `Donya Center',
`Merieux Training Center' and `Groupe Pivot'. Training on project management will be provided
to all actors concerned.

Inadditiona networkofHIV+carepersonnel will bedevelopedto betterrespondto the demand
o f PLWHA. A progressive decentralization o fthe treatment and care system is being designed in
order to cover all the regions by 2009.

Quality control: This is conducted through partnership between the Executive Secretariat, the
National Instituteo f Public Researchand the MerieuxFoundation, particularly for all segmentso f
the project dealing with preventive testing and diagnosis, as well as immunizationand virological
surveillance.

Finally, concerning issues related to medicine and reagent quality control, the project will
collaborate with two institutions - the Direction de la Pharmacie et du M~dicamentand the
Laboratoire National de la Sante` - in order to ensure enforcement o f the regulation and sale
authorization requirements (Autorisation de mise sur le marche` -AMM) and random control o f
medicines and reagents suppliedby various internationalfirms.

Quality will be controlled through a system o f `franchises' or `accreditation' which will ensure
that only the structures which have attained certain norms get the `label' to operate in that
domain. The franchisers will be provided contracts through the MAP.


Component1: Supportto the publicsector response(US$9.0 million)

This component will help ministries and other public institutions initiate andor expand the
response to HIVIAIDS. The component will support the effort o f every ministry to prepare and
implement sectoral plans that addresses the challenge o f HIVIAIDS with a particular emphasis on
prevention and care. Thus, the component will finance the two following major activity sets: (i)
support to the ministries' action plans for HIVIAIDS control; and (ii)   capacity buildingwithin the
Government and the country's HIVIAIDS related public healthcare delivery system to manage
andeffectively carry out the fight against HIVIAIDS ina sustainable manner.

Underthe first mainactivity, the projectwill provide assistanceto ministries:
     to prepare sectoral actions plans against HIVIAIDS for the period o f 2004-2010 that are
     commensurate with the new government policy in this area and to execute them using
     contractual arrangements with the private sector and NGOs. Sector plans will have to take
     into consideration potential overlaps across ministries. More specifically, the project will
     provide technical assistance -primarily consultant services- to HIVIAIDS units within the
     public sector to frame adequately their sectoral response policies, to translate them into
     action plans. Municipalities will also be able to submit proposals under this component,
     to implement the action plans in order to provide ministries staff and their dependents with
     information on HIV/AIDS and opportunistic infections, education, training, condoms and



                                                  34

     other support to encourage HIVIAIDS avoidance behavior. Where needed, the project will
     finance equipmentand cover the incremental operating costs.

 The ministry o f Health (including its PNLS unit) will receive particular attention in order to
 enhance the capacity of the health sector to effectively manage the quality standards for various
 actions to fight HIVIAIDS. Several other donors as well as the Bank are already supportingthe
 sector. To illustrate, each year, the health sector spends around US$2 million from HIPC funds
 for the fight against HIVIAIDS. It should be stressed that the sector has not been able to absorb
 all o f its allocation mainly due to lack o f capacity and major deficiencies in the public health-
 care system. Resources are also available from the Bank-financed Health Sector Project,
PRODESS, which will close inDecember 2005 but still has around US$20 million to disburse.
 Some o f this money could be mobilized for the HIVIAIDS program. Finally, the Global Fundas
well as the AfDB are also expected to engage with new funding for the MOH. A table
 presenting the expected financial contributions as well as the areas o f interventions o f major
donors is presented in Annex 2. It has guidedthe design o f the MAP especially with respect to
the focus on capacity buildingthat is required at this stage for an effective implementation o fthe
various programs currently under preparation and to be implementedinthe months to come.

Underthe secondmain activity highlightedabove, the MAPwill contribute to:

 e    strengthening the surveillance and epi~emiologicaloperational research to provide
     information on the evolution o f the epidemic, using biological and behavioral surveillance
     andadditionalresearchamongvulnerable groups;

 e   expanding the network of voluntary testing and counseling centers (YCTs) throughout the
     country by providing equipment, strengthening and aligning the existing CSCOM to
     internationalstandards; and

 a   strengtheningmanagement of the biomedical waste so as to address the issues raised inthe
     report prepared to that effect (e.g. prevention o f contamination risks related to improper
     disposal o f needles, etc...)

Component2: Supportto the responseofthe privatesector (US$4.7 million)

The objective o f the component is to leverage the capacity of the private sector in Mali to
accelerate and enhance the effectiveness o f government's lead effort in the fight against
HIVIAIDS. Under this component the GOM will establish "Smart- partnerships" based on
`corporate social responsibility' with a selected number o f private firms invested and operating in
key sectors o f the economy and with a representative geographic distribution (mining in Kayes
region, agribusiness, oil and gas distribution, transport, pharmaceutical distributors network,
hotels and tour operators, beverage industryetc.. .)

Private sector involvement will take several forms, namely: (i)outsourcing o f program
implementation for execution,         technical assistance, supervision,     quality control;   and
monitoring`evaluation (M&E) activities to private service providers and organizations; (ii)
execution of action plans at the enterprise level including awareness raising and prevention,
testing and counseling, access to medication and medical services to employees and their
families, or beyond the enterprise to members o f business associations, suppliers and clientele,
and the community at large; (iii)private provision o f social services (e.g. testing centers,
laboratories and clinics, pharmacies); and (iv) public-private partnership through which private
enterprise puts at the disposal o f the national HIVIAIDS program their human and physical




                                                  35

infrastructure, including transport facilities, storage and distribution networks, marketing and
communication means andknow-how to increase coverage or quality o f services.

There are a relatively limitednumber o f large enterprises inMali; a majority o f private businesses
have less than 50 employees and a considerable amount o f private sector activity can be
categorized as informal. So far, the role of the private sector in program execution has been
limited to some isolated, albeit promising, initiatives, usually by larger enterprises, to combat
HNIAIDS, both within the workplace and beyond. No SMEs and none o f the business
federations and associations have initiated any HIVIAIDS programs. And for lack o f a structured
dialogue and systematic exchange o f ideas between private businesses, many opportunities have
remained unexplored. Nevertheless, there is a growing recognition that the business community
has an important role to play.

The strategy to mobilize the private sector would have several elements. Support would be given
for the creation o f a business coalition against HIVIAIDS with a mission to: (i)provide a forum
for exchange o f best practices; (ii)formulate proposals to scale up isolated successful
interventions to comprehensive national programs; and (iii)     put existingprivate sector expertise,
distribution networks and other infrastructure at the disposal o f program execution. It is
anticipated that, inan initial phase, this coalition would include particularly dynamic `champions'
of the cause but would gradually co-opt a broader range o f participants.          SME's would be
targeted through their federations and associations with support for collective and individual
initiatives. Special emphasis would be given to encourage participation by the informal sector
through support for pilot anddemonstrative initiatives that couldbe scaled uprapidly.

The core of this component would be a grant mechanism designed to provoke initiatives from the
private sector to intensify awareness raisinglprevention, testinglcounseling, and access to
medicationlmedical care services for employees, the population at large and specific high risk
groups such as adolescents, truckers, ambulant vendors and commercial sex workers. Funds
would be channeled through grants to companies directly or through their associations. The
activities to be financed will be both broad and flexible, eligibility being limitedby a negative list
which will include: regular operating expenses, construction o f new buildings, vehicles, illegal
items (arms, illegal drugs), and activities that will negatively affect the environment. It will be
expected that sub-projects from SMEs and SME associations will be subsidized at 100 percent
company specific HIVIAIDSprograms will be supported on a matching grant basis with a fifty
percent subsidy rate for programs that cover employees only, and seventy-five percent for
programs that extend beyond the company confines. Financial support for sharing company
know-how, distribution networks and other physical infrastructure will be determined on a case-
by-case basis. The mechanism would be complemented by an intensive communication strategy
designed to reinforce the notion that the private sector can play a key role in the fight against
HIVIAIDS.

Proposals for sub-projects o f national or multi-regional scope, coming from medium or large
enterprises would be evaluated and approved at national level by the CMA before transfer to the
FMA for financing; sub-projects of local scope would be evaluated and approved at the regional
level by the regional antenna's o f the CMA before transfer to the FMA for financing. The
operations o f the grant mechanism would be based on a detailed procedures manual, spelling out
eligibility criteria for applicants, activities and expenses, cost sharing formula, selection criteria,
and sample applicationforms. The CMA would be ready to provide TA to prospective applicants
to identify, develop and submit sub-projects to the CMA for review and approval, andto assist in
implementation. To this end, the CMA would conclude a framework contract with an
independent service provider.


                                                   36

The activities to be financed will be bothbroad and flexible, eligibility being limitedby a
negative list. They will cover all three areas of intervention:

Awareness ruising~reve~tion: is expected that the private sector will play a leadingrole inthis
                                 It
area through provision of information, education andcommunication. Illustrative o f the potential
would be Coca Cola's initiative to prepare educational toolkits and disseminate awareness
messages, targeting its own employees, its clientele, schools, public sector, and rural
communities. Another example would be the support for the formulation and adoption of a
workers' charter, spelling out the rights of employees andjob applicants, building on the work
done by the ILO.

Testing/co~nseling:There is significant potential for private sector provision o f testing services.
Biomerieux Foundation's initiative to establish a private reference laboratory coupled with a
regional training program is particularly promising. It would serve as a model for creating a
network o f private testingcenters, supported by technical assistanceto strengthen capacity for the
provision o f quality services. A franchise system allowing the provision o f training and
accreditation so as to meet the quality standards will be supported by the project.

Access to medicutio~medica~cure: Support would be given to maximize private sector
involvement indistribution by tapping into available nationwide distribution networks. Access to
ARV's would be facilitated through a network of private pharmacies operating under franchise
agreements.

Component3: Supportto the Responseofthe CivilSociety(US$5.4 million)

The objective ofthe component isto develop andexpand initiatives to combat HIVIAIDS by civil
society organizations (CSOs), including community based organizations (CBOs), faith based
organizations (FBOs), NGOs, women's groups, grass roots communities and associations, and
other legally constituted entities. Under this component the capacity o f these organizations will
be reinforcedto identify, prepare and implement actionplans andsub-projects.

The project would support CSOs that are already active by helping them scale up their activities,
and organizations that are new to the field by reinforcing their capacity. Support will be given to
CSOs to undertake three broad types o f activities:         (i)provision o f social mobilization and
training services to grass roots organizations and TA to the preparation o f their sub-projects; (ii)
execution of sub-projects; and (iii)   contractual support to MAP implementation, particularly in
the area o f decentralized M&E.

The MAP execution would rely heavily on partnerships with CSOs at central andregional levels
to ensure a concerted and decentralized response to HIVIAIDS. Mali has a solid record o f
involving NGOs in the execution o f public health programs, notably the Groupe Pivot Sunte
Population, a federation o fNGOs which has a long standing involvement inpubfic health issues.
These and other NGOs would be part o f a roster o f accredited organizations that would be called
uponto play a key role inthe execution o f MAP.

Funds will be channeled directly to CSOs to cover a wide range of activities in the areas of
awarenessraisinglprevention, testinglcounseling, access to medicationlmedical care, provision o f
home and community basedcare for patients, and social support to PLWHA, family members and
orphans. Examples o f activities eligible for support would include: awarenessraisingworkshops,
peer-group counseling services among adolescents and commercial sex workers, community


                                                   37

radio programs, development and implementation o f culturally acceptable social marketing
approaches for condoms, promotion o f collaboration with traditional health practitioners, and
non-medical care givers. Ineligible activities include: four-wheels vehicles, arms, illegal drugs,
civil works beside light renovations, activities that might degrade the environment, income-
generating activities, activities requiring sophisticated technical support, activities which might
increaserecurrent costs which the structure mightnot be able to sustain.

In an initial phase of the project, the Executive Secretariat (ES) will analyze the technical
assistance requirements o f CSOs to improve their capacity to identify and undertake effective
sub-projects and will develop a capacity buildingplan, based in large measure on the grassroots
management training methodology developed by the World Bank Institute. Implementation o f
this capacity buildingplancantake three possible forms:


     1. Lineministriescan provide services to strengthen thecapacity o f CSOs andassistthem in
     developingactionplans inthe three areas o f intervention;
     2. The CMA can provide capacity buildingsupport through its network o fenlistedNGOs
     and service providers;
     3. NationalNGOswith reputed capacity buildingprograms can submit requeststo the CMA
     for financing projects to provide participatory diagnosis services to smaller NGOs, CBOs and
     other CSOs to stimulate demand and help them identify activities and prepareaction plans in
     the fight against HIVIAIDS.


CSOs will submit their action plans to the CMA at the national or regional level according to the
amount and geographic coverage involved, for review and approval. Upon approval o f these
action plans, packageso f activities would be submitted for funding. Activities would be executed
.based on an implementation agreement between the CSO and CMA, specifying the expected
results o f the sub-project. Where necessary, the project will provide capacity buildingsupport in
the area of financial and management skills, including budgeting, community basedmanagement
o f funds, procurement o f goods and services, and reporting. The modalities o f this process will
be spelled out in the above-mentioned procedures manual. Specifics of this manual are to be
Jinalized by effectiveness.

An openNGOroster will be established and maintainedby one ofthe NGO umbrella institutions
or by a private sector firm. Only NGOs with certain criteria such as at least two years o f activity,
sadsfactory audits, capacity to manage funds, would be eligible for the roster. Grants will only be
given to NGOs which are included inthe roster. A campaign to let the roster eligibility criteria be
known will be undertaken eachyear and NGOswhich do not qualify will be able to benefit from
technical support to bringthem upto the standard.

Component4: Project Coordination,Monitoring and Evaluation(US$6.4 million)

The project will be managed by the Executive Secretariat (ES) o f the HNAC. The ES/NAC
will be comprised o f the following core team: an Executive Secretary, a maximum o f four
technical advisors in charge of facilitating implementation o f each component and ensuring that
preventiodsensitization; public health especially for testing andcounseling, access to drugs, care
and psychosocial support; outreach for the mobilizationo fthe various actors; andmonitoring and
evaluation are beingcarried out properly. Inaddition, there will be two staff members in charge
o f financial management and procurement issues respectively, and three support staE an
accountant, an executive assistant, and a driver. The FMA and the CMA will be under contract


                                                 38

with the ES/HNAC to manage the day to day financial, procurement and contract management
transactions o f the project. The financial and the procurement officers within the E S m A C will
have the responsibility o f liaising with the FMA and CMA to make sure that they meet their
obligations, to prepare relevant reports for the HNAC, and to bridge to other programs for
HNIAIDS on issues oftheir respective responsibility,

This component will consist o f the provision o f technical support services, equipment and
materials to implement a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation plan; epidemiological
surveillance, surveys; financial and program management; and operation research to ensure the
maximum program learning and dissemination. Mali has the capacity to establish international
partnerships in both biological and behavioral surveillance and epidemiological research. The
MAP would contribute to financing a demographic and health survey; a bio-annual behavioral
surveillance survey to monitor behavioral change among targeted groups. In addition, a
management information system will be put in place at the central level duringthe project start
up, to monitor boththe technicalandfinancial aspects ofproject implementation. Finally, inorder
to ensure the quality o f services required, there might be some contracts with institutions
specialized in certain areas and which will helpthe HNAC ensure quality control.

The executive Secretariat o f the HNAC will be responsible for coordinating the administrative
and financial management aspects o fthe project, based on contracts with the CMA and the FMA
respectively. The executive secretariat of the HNAC will monitor, through a comprehensive
M&E system, the progress achieved towards the achievement of the program performance
targets. All key actors in the fight against WIAIDS will contribute to the M&Esystem as they
will be involved indata collection andanalysis.

The MAP will be implemented by a large number o f public agencies, civil society organizations
and private enterprises. The execution of MAP will be placedunder the oversight o fthe National
HighCouncil on HIVlAIDS(Haut Conseil~utionalde Lutte contre le SIDA-HCNLS) which is
chaired by the Head of State. The HCNLS will execute its mandate through the National
Executive Secretariat (Secretariat ~ x ~ c u t ~ ~ u t i oEShINAC). The EShINAC will be created
                                                          n a l -
by PresidentialDecree and its specific tasks will include:

     Coordinate the formulation o f the National HIVIAIDS Strategy andAction Plans;
     Coordinate the execution, monitoring and evaluation o f all HIVIAIDS programs;
     Act as an interface between the HCNLS andall stakeholders;
     Provide the secretariatto the HCNLS, including the preparation o ftechnical reports, the
     recordingo f decisions taken duringthe meetingsand ensuringtheir execution;
     Prepare and submit the financial statementsandprogramreports to the HCNLS;
     Represent the HCNLS inmeetings withvarious levels o f Government andother partners;
     Ensure the provision o ftechnical assistance and quality assuranceto partners involved inthe
     national responses;
     Develop a knowledge base o f the epidemic, new developments andtechnologies and
     disseminate best practices;
     Ensuremonitoringandevaluation ofthe overall Action Plan, includingall sector andlocal
     plans.

 The ESkINAC will coordinate implementation o f the project at the national level and will
operate on the principle o f `ffaire-faire" (see the figure in Annex 6 for MAP'S implementation
structure). The evaluation o f sub-projects to be financed under the project, and the fiduciary
issues of the project execution will be contracted out to a private sector Contract Management
Agency (CMA) and a private sector Financial Management Agency (FMA), both selected on a
competitive basis. Contracting out procuremen~contractmanagement as well as financial
managementto independent, private agencies is inline with M A P best practice to ensure the most
rapid and transparent decision making and procurement o f goods services, and the most flexible
and efficient mobilization o f resources to the project beneficiaries. In addition, the ES will
contract with private sector firms to perform services on a retainer basis in the areas of: (i)
training; (ii)
             financial and operational audits and monitoring and evaluation; (iii) control
                                                                                    quality

The manual o f procedures, which is a requirement for project effectiveness, will spell-out all the
implementationmodalities.

Summary of FinancialManagementAssessment

ImplementingEntity

The project will be managed by the Executive Secretariat (ES/"AC)              o f the HNAC. The
ESMNAC will coordinate the project implementationat the national level and will operate on the
principle o f `ffaire-faire" (see figure in Annex 6 for MAP'S implementation structure). Project
execution will be contracted out to a private sector Contract Management Agency (CMA) and a
private sector Financial Management Agency (FMA), both selected on a competitive basis. The
FMA andthe CMA will be under contract with the ES/"AC           to managethe day to day financial
and procurement transactions o fthe project.

Staffing

The ESMNAC will appoint a Finance Officer with academic and professional qualification
acceptable to the IDA. Reporting to the Coordinator, she should be capable o f directing and
guiding the financial management operations of the project in liaison with FMA & CMA by
making sure that they meet their obligations, prepare relevant reports for the HNAC, and bridge
to other programs against HIVlAIDSon issuesof their respective responsibility.


Riskanalysis
The overall conclusion o fthe MaliCountry FinancialAccountability Assessment (CFAA) carried
out in 2002 and completed in 2003 i s that "the public finance management system is fairly
coherentwith relatively strong budgetprocedures implementedwithin a clear i~titutionalsetting
with improving and strengthened control measures". It goes on to add that "This reality should
not hide ma~unctions     for which appropriate dispositions should be taken." Inessence, the CFAA
shows that significant progress has been made in the areas o f financial management. The
country's own control systems are operating more efficiently despite a few weaknesses in the
supervision o f projects.
Consequently various measuresto mitigatethese risks have been agreedupon andthus the project
risk from a financial management perspective could be moderate, provided the risk mitigating
measures are properly addressed. Therefore financial management arrangements are designed to
ensure that funds are used for the purpose intended, and timely information is produced for
project management and Government oversight, and facilitate the compliance with IDA fiduciary
requirements.

ControlRisks
The main control risks, ratings and mitigating measures are tabulated below. The project risk
from a financial management perspective is considered moderate, Given the outsourcing
arrangements that are already inplace for the management o f the PPF andthat will be maintained
inforce throughout the project life.
InformationSystems: An integrated information system will be set up in line with the Fiduciary
agencies(FMA & CMA) and ESENAC.

Funds will be deposited inthe SpecialAccounts, when the conditions for Grant Effectiveness are
met. All bank accounts will be reconciledwith bank statements on a monthly basis by the FMA
and validated by a Finance Officer, Detailedbankingarrangements, including control procedures
over all bank transactions (e.g. check signatories, transfers, etc., .) will be documented in the
Manual of Procedures.

Methodof Disbursements

Initially, disbursement of IDA funds to the Project Management will be transaction-based (i.e.
summary sheets andstatement of expenditures. Inparallel, FinancialMonitoringReports (FMRs)
will be submitted to IDA, that integrate financial reporting, procurement and contract
management with physical implementationprogress.

An advance will be made into the respective Special Accounts at the inceptionofthe project. The
advance will cover project expenditures for an estimated six months period in accordance with
the initial six -month cash flow forecast. Once, the project moves to FMR-based disbursements, it
will submit FMRs which include a cash flow forecast for the following six month period. The
cash request at the reporting date will be the amount required for the forecast period as shown in
the approved FMRs less the balance inthe Special Account at the end o f the quarter. Subsequent
disbursements o fthe IDA fimds will be made inrespect o fthis request,

The option o f disbursingthe funds through direct payments from IDA on contracts above a pre-
determined threshold will also be available. Withdrawal applications for such payments will be
accompanied by relevant supporting documents such as copies of the contract, contractors'
invoices and appropriate certifications. Detailed disbursement procedures will be documented in
the FAPM.

Disbursements for all expenditures will be made against full documentation, except for items
claimed under the Statement o f Expenditures (SOE) procedure. SOEs will be used for payments
claimed under contracts for: (a) works in an amount inferior to US$500,000, (b) goods in an
amount inferior to US$250,000; (c) consulting fwms in an amount inferior to US$lOO,OOO; (d)
individual consultants inan amount inferior to US$50,000. SOEs will likewise be utilized for all
small equipment, office supplies and training. Documentationsupportingall expenditures claimed
against SOEs will be retained by ES/HNAC, and will be made available for review when
requestedby IDA periodic supervisionmissions and project external auditors. All disbursements
are subject to the conditions o f the Development Grant Agreement and the procedures defined in
the Disbursement Letter.

Special accounts

To facilitate project implementation and reduce the volume of withdrawal applications, two
Special Accounts in FCFA will be opened by E S m A C with appropriate authorized allocations
in a commercial bank on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. The authorized allocations
would be FCFA 700 million for Special Account A and FCFA 2 billion for Special Account B,
respectively, which will cover about six months o f eligible expenditures. To the extent possible,
all o f IDA'S share of expenditures should be paid through the special accounts. The Special
Accounts will be replenished on a monthly basis through the submission o f Withdrawal
Applications supported by appropriate documentation as required untilsuch time as the borrower
may choose to convert to report-based disbursement, In lieu o f SA, the borrower may also
chooseto pre-finance project expenditures and seek reimbursement from IDA.

Upon Grant effectiveness, IDA will deposit the amount o f FCFA 350 million into Special
Account A and FCFA 1 billion into Special Account B representing fifty (50%) percent o f the
authorized allocations. The Special Accounts will be used for all payments inferior to 20%
percent of the authorized allocation and ES/HNAC will submit replenishment applications on a



                                                49

monthly basis. Further deposits by IDA into the Special Accounts will be made against
withdrawal applications supported by appropriate documents.

The FMA will open and manage second generation accounts in the three regional offices. The
authorized allocations will be about FCFA 300 million for each office and will cover about four
months o f expenditures. The advances will finance contracts with NGOs and the private sector as
well as financing agreementswith CBOs.

Counterpartfunds and taxes: The Government ofMali has sent a letter to the Bank indicating
that there will be no taxes on any activity related to the MAP. In order to accelerate the
implementation o f the project, and given that the Government is already putting 6 billion CFAF
inthe provision of drugs, it is proposedthat there be no counterpart fundingrequirement for this
project.

                               Multi-SectoralHIV/AIDS Project


Bank Guidelines: Procurement of civil works and goods will be carried out in accordance with
the Guidelines: Procurement under I3R.D Loans and IDA Credits dated May 2004. Bank`s
Standard Bidding Documents and Standard Bid Evaluation Forms for works and goods under
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) will be used, National competitive bidding for works
and goods will use the Government Standard Bidding Documents satisfactory to the IDA for
procurement o f works and goods under National Competitive Bidding (NCB); and IDA's
Standard BidEvaluation forms will be used for NCB contracts with necessarymodifications.

Selection o f Consultants will be carried out in accordance with the Guidelines: Selection and
Em~loymentof Consultants by the World Bank Borrowers dated May 2004, IDA's Standard
Requestfor Proposals andevaluation forms will be usedwhere applicable.

Contracts for community based subprojects will be procured in accordance with paragraph 3.17
of the IDA's procurement guidelines (Community Participation in Procurement) and the IDA'S
Guidelines for ~ i m ~ l Procurement and Disbursement for Communi~-3~sedInvestments
                            ~ e d
(February 1998). The Project ImplementationManual (PIM) would describe indetail the specific
procurement arrangements of the Community basedcomponent.

Contracts will be managed by a dedicated agency under contract with the ES/HNAC as shown in
the chart below. The CMA will be responsible for evaluation o f and decision making on all sub-
project proposals, as well as for overall procurement and contract management, except contracts
for general supplies for the project operating needs, and for financial audits and technical audits.
CMA will establish a decentralized structure by installing three regional antennas, each o f which
will report to it and employ experts inthe three MAP intervention areas: preventionlawareness,
testingkounseling, and access to medicatiom`medical care. Sub-projects up to an amount of
US$50,000 can be approved by the CMA internally. Sub-projects exceeding this amount needto
be submitted to the ES/HNAC for clearance, prior to the CMA's decision. Upon approval, all
sub-projects will be sent to the FMA to start the payment process. Copies o f all sub-projects
together with a summary report and PV's o f the decision meetings, will be submitted quarterly to
the ES/HNAC for ex-post control.

CMA's operations will be based on a detailed procedures manual, spelling out eligibility criteria
for activities and expenses, evaluation and decision making processes for sub-projects,
procurement procedures for goods and services, and first line performance monitoring. Each sub-
project will be based on a convention (or an agreement) concluded between CMA and the
beneficiary organization.

Advertising

Upon Board approval, a General Procurement Notice (GPN) would be prepared and published in
the UN Development Business (UNDB) online, Development Gateway (dgMarket), and in a
national newspaper of wide circulation to advertise for major consulting assignments (above
US$200.000 equivalent) and I C 8 for which specific contracts are expected. The ESiHNAC and
the Contract Management Agency, will keep a roster o f the responsesreceived from the potential
bidders interested inthe contracts. Specific Procurement Notices (SPN) for goods and works to
be procured under ICB will be published in at least a national newspaper o f wide circulation (or
inthe official gazette, or inan electronic portal with free access) and may also be advertised in
the UNDB online and Development Gateway (dgMarket) in order to get the broadest interest
possible from eligible bidders. The advertisement for specific Procurement Notices (SPN) for
goods and works to be procured under NCB, may be limited to the national press or official
gazette, or a free open access website. In both cases (i.e. ICB or NCB), the date o f the SPN
should coincide with the date that the biddingdocuments are available for purchase by interested
bidders. Large consulting services (above US$200,000 equivalent) will be advertised of the
UNDBonline, DevelopmentGateway and inan internationalor technical newspaper, inorder to
seek expressions o f interest (EOI) prior to the preparation o f the shortlist. Copy o f this
advertisement will be sent to those firms which responded to the expression o f interest for
consulting contracts listed inthe GPN. It is also encouragedto contact embassiesand professional
organizations. Request for EO1for other consulting services (below US$200,000 equivalent) will
be advertised ina national newspapero f wide circulation. At least two weeks will be allowed for
submission o f expression o f interest.

ProcurementCapacityAssessment

A key feature o f this Mali MAP is that contractingwould be outsourced to a qualified Contract
ManagementAgency as discussedabove. The terms o f reference for recruitment o f the CMA
will integrate all the core fiduciary requirements to handle all procurement-related matters, In
addition, there will be a qualified procurement specialist in the ESI"AC     whose responsibility
will be to liaise with the CMA and ensure that all relevant issues inthis matter are addressedby
decision-makers as needed.

 The CMA will develop and maintain a roster o f service providers (NGOs, private firms) and
other service providers working in HIVJAIDS that can either be subcontracted by CMA, or be
contracted by beneficiary organizations directly to provide technical assistanceand support to the
design and implementation o f eligible AIDS prevention and care activities, as well as contribute
to the monitoring and evaluation of these activities. This roster will classify service providers
and other service providers according to their experience, geographic coverage, target
beneficiaries and ability to carry out HIVlAIDS projects. An assessment o f NGO and other
service providers is beingundertaken inorder to set upthis roster.

Inorder to ensure that participating agencies (line ministries, regions, communities) are familiar
with IDA'Sprocurement guidelines in general and the procurement procedures particular to this
MAP, the CMA would provide a series o f workshops, with the first organized at Effectiveness
withthe assistanceo fIDA. The costs o fthese workshops would be includedinthe project.

ProcurementPlanning: A draft procurement plan was preparedby the Beneficiary, and was
approved duringNegotiations. This procurement plancontains all procurement to be carried out
for the first 18 months of implementation. Pendingthe recruitment o f the procurement specialist
and of the CMA, the Financial Manager inthe President's General Secretariat will be incharge of


                                                 53

procurement issues, particularly at the time o f Grant negotiation. The detailed procurement plans
for subsequentyears will be developed and submitted to IDA for review and approval. The exact
mix o f procurement will be determined on an annual basis during the joint annual reviews
between the ES/HNAC and the CMA, line ministries, IDA, and other partners, where a draft
procurement plan for the following financial year will be presented and agreed upon, The plan
will include relevant information on goods, works and consulting services expected to be
procured, and their estimated cost; procurementlselection method as well as timing in the
procurementlselection process. Implementation o f these plans will be reviewed by IDA
supervision missions and by the external technical audits ifneeded. The procurement plan will be
updated on annual basis in conjunction with preparation of the sector action plan. All
procurement will be carried out in accordance with the formally agreed procurement plan
(original and formally updated).

The procurement plan described above excludes sub-projects to be implemented by CSOs and
private sector entities. Their demand driven nature makes it difficult to finalize procurement plan
for this component at this stage. However, the agreement document of each approved sub-project
will includea procurement schedulefor completing the sub-project.

Procurement ImplementationArrangements: The procurement implementationarrangements
that are considered at this stage are the following: Procurement would be done at national and
regional levels, with a grouping o f regions in three zones: zone one (Bamako, Koulikoro, and
Kayes), zone two (Skgou, Sikasso, and Mopti), and zone three (Gao, Kidal and Tomboktou). In
all cases, procurement matters will be handled bythe CMA.

PublicSector: A formal contract aimedat implementingthe portion ofthe program agreed upon
between each line ministrylpublic entity and the ES/HNAC to be financed under the MAP will be
signed with the CMA. The latter will be responsible for bundlingsimilar activities together and
contract them out, to the maximum extent possible, to private service providers andNGOs.

ProcurementMethods

CivilWorks (US$ 1.18 million)

Civilworks contractswill bevery limitedin number and invalue. Hence, noICB and NCB
are foreseen under the project. Rehabilitation of facilities for line ministries and institution
estimated at less than US$50,000 equivalent per contract will be procured under lump-sum, fixed-
price contracts awarded on the basis o f quotations obtained from not less than three (3) qualified
domestic contractors (preferably more in order to obtain at least three comparable offers) invited
in writing to bid. The invitation shall, among other things, include a detailed description of the
works, including basic specifications, relevant drawings and bill o f quantities where applicable,
the required completion date and a basic form o f agreement acceptable to the IDA. A sufficient
bid submission period will be allowed and bids will be opened inpublic. Inall cases the award
shall be made to the contractor who offers the lowest price evaluated quotation for the required
work, andwho has the experience and resourcesto complete the contract successfully.

For small works that may be included in sub-projects, given the sub-projects and micro-projects
size, amount and demand-driven nature, these contracts would be governed when applicable by
the Guidelines for Simplified Procurement and Disbursement for Community-Based Investments
(February 1998) detailed inthe ProjectImplementation Manual approved by the IDA.




                                                 54

Goods (US$9.62)million

The total cost o f goods including drugs is estimated at US$9.62 millionequivalent for the project,
not including contracts for goods under the community sub-projects. The items would include:
office equipment, furniture and materials, audio-visual and laboratory equipment; vehicles;
HIVIAIDS-related health commodities; condoms; IEC materials; and other project related
supplies. Procurement o f goods will be bulked where feasible into packages valued at
US$250,000 equivalent or more per packageandwill be procuredthroughICB.

NonMedicalGoods

(a)     Goods estimated to cost less than US$250,000 and more than US$50,000 would be
procured through nationalcompetitive bidding(NCB).

(b)     Goods estimated to cost US$SO,OOO equivalent or less per contract may be procured
through Shoppingprocedures. Contract will be awarded on the basis o f written solicitation issued
to several suppliers, at least three qualified suppliers, following evaluation o f bids received in
writing from such qualified suppliers. The award would be made to the supplier with the lowest
price quotationfor the required goods, provided it has the experience andresourcesto executethe
contract successfully.

(c)     Specific Goods, such as vehicles and motorcycles needed throughout the project may be
grouped and procuredthrough IAPSO, inaccordancewith the provisions o f paragraph 3.9 of the
Guidelines.

Medicalequipment and HIV-related goods

Regarding the procurement o f ARVs, the market situation o f each product, the nature of the
medicines and medical supplies, and the critical dates for delivery - are all major factors
determining the choice of procurement method. The majority of ARVs and some other
HIVIAIDS related drugs are either single source or limited-source products. Therefore, limited
international bidding, direct contracting, or shopping may be the most appropriate procurement
method. However, the use of such procurement methods would be subject to the IDA prior
review.

(a)     ARVs, reagents, laboratory equipment and other HIVIAIDS related drugs to cost
US$250,000 equivalent or less per contract may be procured through Shopping procedures (at
international level). Contract will be awarded on the basis o f written solicitation issued to several
suppliers, at least three qualified suppliers or pre-qualified WHO (World Health Organization)
suppliers, following evaluation of bids received in writing from such qualified suppliers. The
award would be made to the supplier with the lowest price quotation for the required goods,
provided it has the experience and resources to execute the contract successfully. This method
will be used inthe cases where there are only a few known suppliers and provided it will have
beenindicated inthe annual procurement planreviewedby IDA.

(b)     HIVIAIDS-related health commodities, such as drugs including ARV and reagents,
medical supplies, tests equipment, blood-takinglgiving sets, milk substitutes, antiseptics and anti-
TB drugs can beprocuredfrom IAPSO, WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA and other specialized agencies
of the UnitedNations, inaccordance with the Guidelines (paragraph 3.9).




                                                 55

(c)      Procurement o f reagents for HIVIAIDS and blood transfusion security considered as
proprietary items may be procured directly, with prior approval o f IDA, from manufacturers and
authorized local distributors in view o f the requirements o f existing laboratory/testing equipment
inMali.

Consulting Services, Studies, and Training (US$5.78 million)

Consultants guidelines would apply for the recruiting o f consultant services, studies and training
such as studies and surveys related to the monitoring and evaluation activities, trainers,
community development specialists, public relations firms (IEC campaigns, financial and
technical audits. The recruitment o f contractual staff for the ESMNAC core staff (regardless o f
the level), to be financed under the operating cost category, including for the coordination,
procurement, financial management, and accounting specialists, would follow consultants
guidelines for the recruitment o f individualconsultants, Section V o fthe Guidelines.

(a)      Quality and Cost-based Selection: All consulting service contracts for firms would be
awarded through Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS) method including the selection o f
auditors. To ensure that priority i s given to the identification o f suitable and qualified national
consultants, short-lists for contracts estimated at or less than US$ 100,000 equivalent may be
comprised entirely o f national consultants (in accordance with the provisions o f paragraph 2.7 of
the Consultant Guidelines), provided that a sufficient number o f qualified individuals or firms are
available. However, if foreign firms have expressed interest, they would not be excluded from
consideration.

(b)      Consultant's Qualification Selection may be used for consulting services for research,
and targeted interventions for which organizations with specialized expertise, strong capacities to
work with vulnerable groups andproventrack records would be recruited, for contracts estimated
to cost less than US$50,000 equivalent.

(c)       Single source selection may be used for the provision o f consultant services in the areas
o f quality control o f testing services and drugs in accordance with paragraph 3.9 to 3.11 of the
Consultant Guidelines.

(d)      Consultant for services meeting the requirements o f section V o f the Consultant
Guidelines, will be selected under the provisions for the Selection of ~ndividualCons~~tan~s,      i.e.
through the comparison ofthe curriculum vitae o f at leastthree qualified individuals.

Training, Workshops, Study Tours, and Conferences (US$ 1.80 million equivalent).
Training, workshops, conference attendance and study tours will be carried out on the basis o f
approved annual training programs that will identify the general framework o f training and
similar activities for the year, including the nature o f training, study tours, workshops, the number
o f participants, and cost estimates.

Prior Review Thresholds (Table B)

Procurement performance at all levels (national, regional, departmental and community) would
be carriedout duringIDA supervisionmissions and through annual ex-post audit andor technical
 independent audit, Thresholds have been set on the basis that procurement will be sub-contracted
to a Contract Management Agency. Therefore the prior review thresholds are set for mediumrisk
as the CMA is normally expected to have an adequate procurement experience, All contracts,
which are not subject to prior review according to Table Bywould be subject to post- review in


                                                  56

accordance with paragraph 5 Appendix Io fthe Procurement Guidelines, and with the paragraph 5
of the Appendix Io fthe Consultants Guidelines.

The Beneficiary and IDA will review all thresholds stated in this section on an annual basis.
Amendments may be agreed upon based on performance and actual values of procurement
implemented. Amendments to the Development Grant Agreement (DGA) may be proposed
accordingly.

Works: Contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of US$500,000 or more if any, would be
subject to IDA prior review. In addition; the first three contracts (quotation are excluded) o f
works awarded through National Competitive Bidding, estimated to cost less than the equivalent
ofUS$500,000 would be subject to IDA prior review.

Non Medical Goods : Contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of US$250,000 equivalent or
more and the first three contracts (quotation are excluded) would be subject to IDA prior review.

Medicalequipment and HIV-related Goods: All contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of
US$250,000 or more and all contracts to be awarded through single source procedure would be
subject to IDA prior review.

Consultant services : Contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of US$lOO,OOO or more for
firms, contracts for individual consultants o f US$50,000 equivalent or more, and all contracts to
be awarded through single source procedure would be subject to IDA prior review.

The first ten sub-projects with communities are subject to prior review by the Bank.

Sub-projects o f more than US$50,000 need prior approval o f ES/HNAC, while sub-projects o f
US$50,000 equivalent or less can be approved by the CMA only.

Contracts awarded by sub-projects beneficiaries, are subject to the prior review o f the CMA as
spelled out inthe Manual o f Procedures.

Riskand Frequency of procurementsupervision.Inorder to minimize the procurement risk, a
Contract Management Agency will be recruited through international competitive bidding, thus
securing the needed expertise upfront. In addition, IDA agreed with the Government during
Negotiations for one supervision mission every six months for the first two years, including a
special procurement supervisionfor post-review audits.

Existing experience in contracting out procurement responsibilities in Mali lies with
infiastructure projects as it has been the case with AGETIF'E-Mali and AGETJER-Mali. The
proposed CMA is the first case o f outsourcing in social services with large contracts. While this
arrangement is intended to mitigate procurement risks in the course o f implementation o f this
project, the actual firm to enter inthis contract not beingknown yet to assess its track record, the
riskassessment atthis point is mediumto high.

Frequencyof ProcurementSupervisionMissions

Once every six (6) months (including special procurement supervisionfor post-reviewlaudits) for
the first two years, and one supervision per year for subsequent years contingent to the
performance ofthe CMA andthe procurement staff ofthe ESIHNAC.

                               Annex 9: Economicand FinancialAnalysis
                                     Multi-SectoralHIVIAIDSProject

The cost benefit analysis aims to measure the benefits o f implementing the MAP. The latter is
expected to contribute, among others, to reducing the outputlincome losses due to depletion of
human capital resulting from deaths and other impediments related to the disease (absenteeism,
labor turnover, recruitment and training costs o f new workers, lack o f focus, lack o f knowledge
transmission from infectedldeceased parents to children, health insurance expenditures, diversion
o f resourcesfrom other productive expenditures, etc.)

The short, medium and long term economic effects are estimated. The model used here is
obviously simplifiedgiven the complexity o fthe dynamics between HNlAIDS andthe economy,
It is built to estimate the impacts of more straightforward relationships between the project and
key variables which can be reasonably quantified.There is a highdegree of uncertainty about the
epidemiological situation and its short, medium and long term evolution, Nevertheless, policy
decision-making should be highly preemptive and based on the worst case scenario in order to
prevent an outbreak of the epidemic. This cost-benefit analysis calls for a forward-looking
approach when measuring the severity o fthe HIVlAIDS crisis, and it highlightsthe economic and
social cost o f doing nothing or too little. The results, based on key assumptions, give a sense of
the trends, notwithstanding the degree o f uncertainty inherently associated with similar cost-
benefitanalyses.

 Assumptions` I key parameters(in the base casescenario):


     1. The MAP will catalyze resourcesneededfor preventionandtreatment, Its contributionto
         the overalf. effect o f the HIVIAIDS program in Mali is proportional to its financial
         contributionto this programestimated at about 20 percent over the lifetime o fthe project.
     2. About 170,000 persons are estimated to be HIV positive in2003, o f whom approximately
          LO percent would be immediately eligible to medical treatment with ARVs (CD4 count
         less than 200). Duringthe project implementation, the MAP will provide support to 9000
         patients by 2007 o f whom 2,250             medically in need of ARV during the first year o f
         project implementation. The same number o f patients will be supported in 2008. After
         project closing and after the required capacities and institutions are sufficiently
         strengthened, it is assumed that comprehensive external assistance will crowd in to
         complement GOM continued effort to provide free ARVs to 100 percent o f the eligible
         patients.
     3. Growth rate o f persons infected in the absence o f the MAP ("without project"case*) is
         such that Mali would reach a prevalence rate o f 10 percent in20 years as experienced in




  Itis importantto spell out allthe assumptions used inthe model inorder to providebenchmarking for
andfacilitate comparison ofthe results ofthe cost-benefit analysis that will be carried out at project
closing. The M&Esystem is expected to regularly collect all the relevant data.
  Currently, only six percent ofthe estimated number o fpatients inneed o ftreatment (1,073) have accessto
ARVs.
* The  net effect o fthe project is derived from the difference between"with MAP project" and "without
MAPproject" cases.

        several African countries'. Growth rate of persons infected in the "with project" case
        would maintainthe prevalencerate below 3 percent.
    4. 3 percent of pregnant women are infected. The chance o f mother-to-child transmission is
        40 percent without project. The cost of preventing mother-to-child transmission is $5 for
        the purchaseo freagents equipment to complement the drug already available and free".
    5.  The average yearly unit cost of drugs is $150. The costs start decreasing by 10percent a
        year after project implementation. The average yearly unit cost for children is $1000
        since generics for children are not available. The yearly unit costs o f monitoring the
        patients, treatment of AIDS-related illnesses and psycho-social monitoring are
        respectively $100, $15 and $30. The average cost o f funeral and mourning i s $1,000 per
        death.
    6.   For the drug to be effective, it is also assumedthat there is no nutritional deficiency for
        the patients.
    7. In the "with project'' case, the average mortality rate o f population infected remains
        unchanged at 4 percent the first five years and decreases to 3 percent the following 5
        years and stabilizes at 2 percent thereafter. For the "without project" situation, the
        average mortality rate remains unchanged at 5 percent over the 30-year timeframe".
    8. The populationgrowth rate is constant at 2.3 percent per annum.
    9. The average annual real GDP growth rate (counterfactual benchmark GDP, i.e. in the
        absence o f AIDS) is about 3 percent. This is a minimum growth rate to prevent a
        worsening o f the poverty situation that wouldjeopardize the fight against AIDS giventhe
        established empirical evidence o f positive correlation between povertylinequality and the
        spread o fAIDS.
    10. Corporate tax rate is 30 percent. This rate is used to estimate the reduction in potential
        corporate tax      revenues (paid       by companies)        as   the result of decreased
        produ~tivity/pro~tabili~**.  Personal income tax rate is 23 percent. Due to low capacity
        utilization rate, deceased people are not necessarily replaced inthe company (ifthey are,
        this canbewith a longdelay), This may negatively affect personal incometaxes collected
        by GOM. The person infected and physically affected without treatment works 50
        percent less time than the non infected. The person infected with treatment works 4
        percent lesstime thanthe non infe~ted'~,

Results (base case)

Inthe base case scenario, the project generatesa positiveNetPresentVa1ueI4("PV) after twelve
years. After the 30-year timeframe, the seroprevalence increased at 2.34 percent (up from 1.7
percent in 2001) while the NPV amounts to US$68 million. Inthe short term, the burden o f the
overall cost o f care negatively and considerably affects the results but it is important to stress that
this is a sound and preemptive burden given its positive medium and long term impact on
economic and social welfare, Indeed, the positive impact o f the project on the economy is due to
several factors which have been captured and estimated in the simple model used, In the base
case scenario, compared to a situation "without project" (benchmark) and for a 30-year
timeframe, the MAP is expectedto contributeto the followingpositive developments:

 (i)     Reduce the number o f persons infected from 5.8 million to 0,5 million (which
         corresponds to a decline o f seroprevalence rate from 29.33 percent to 2.34 percent) as
         the resulto f better prevention.

 (ii)    Reduce the number o f deaths from 229,000 to 21,000 people. This results from the
         decline in the number o f persons infected and the improved access to treatment which
         extends life expectancy. Consequently, the cost related to funerals and mourning drops
         by US$208million.

 (iii)   Reduce the number o f infected new born babies by 1.5 million. The drog (nevirapine)
         requiredto prevent mother-to-child transmission i s already available and free. However,
         there are frequent shortage o f reagents especially outside o f Bamako. The project will
         ensure access to these reagents and hence, contribute to saving thousands o f life which
         will generate value added inthe long term. When comparing the free cost o f the drugs
         and the relatively low cost o f the reagents with the high cost o f treatment o f infected
         children, one easily understands the human, social and economic benefit o f preventing
         thetransmission.

 (iv)    Reduce accumulated losses in value added. Without the project, the economy grows at
         an average annual rate of 2.9 percent compared to 2.99 percent with the project. Inother
         words, the project contributes to reducing losses in economic growth from 0.1 to 0.01
         point of percentage. The reduction o f value added lost can be mainly explained by the
         reduction o f number o f death and number o f persons infected. The productivity o f the
         persons infected is less affectedthan without the project. Insum, the project contributes
         to preservinga greater quantityand quality o f humancapital, key input o f the production
         function. It is important to emphasize that the reduction in value added lost is
         underestimated; it could have been higher if we had taken into account, in the without
         project case, the losses in productivity that result from the increased labor turnover and
         the knowledge lost which couldhave been spilled over the company, the family and the
         society in large. Finally, it should be stressedthat we assumedthat the infected persons
         contribute to GDP either in the formal or informal sector; the effect o f high
         unemployment onthe size o fvalue added lost is therefore neutralized.

 (v)     Reduce losses inemployment incomes by US$420 million, from US$458 million to $38
         million directly andmainly resulting from the reduction o f number o f deaths.


l4NPV is calculatedhere usingas benefits: the reductioninvalue added losses, reductionin employment
income losses, reductionincorporateand persona1incometax losses, reductionincost of care, and
reductionincostrelatedto funeral and mourning.


                                                  62

(vi)     Reduce losses in corporate taxes from US$258 million to US$5.4 million. GOM would,
         other things being equal (not taking into account the cost o f providing free drugs) and
         from a fiscal perspective, be better off with the project which limits the depletion of
         taxable corporate value added. In the same way, GOM would benefit from reduced
         losses in employment income taxes from US$lOS million to US$9 million. Inthe base
         case scenario, it is assumed a continued support from donors which ensures the same
         level o f access to healthcare at the same subsidized price. Sustainability i s therefore not
         an issueandthe budgetary impact, interms of cost and reallocation, is easily controlled.

        Intervening early would reduce tax losses which could have otherwise weaken GOM's
        fiscal position. Indeed, if 100 percent o f the patients eligible to ARV are covered (for an
        amount estimated at $59 million), corporate and personal income taxes losses would
        amount to only $14 million compared to $36315million if the GOM does not intervene
        enough and spend $3 million to cover only 6 percent o f the eligible patients, It is
        therefore essential to improve access to drugs not only to improve the welfare of the
        affected population but also for macroeconomic stability. However, sustainability o f free
        access to ARV after project closing would be ensured only under continued government
        support (budget allocation) to the program and, comprehensive and well coordinated
        external assistance.

Sensitivity analysis

The sensitivity of theNPVto assumptionsanduncertain future values is assessedunderthe following
scenarios:

    (i)      lower estimate ofthe number o fpersons infected(110,000 persons);
    (ii)     higher estimate o fthe number ofpersons infected(250,000 persons);

Inthe "lower estimate" case, the NPV becomes positive after the sixteenth year. The prevalence rate at
the end o f the 30-year timeframe is 1.5 percent while the NPV reaches US$49 million. The fiscal cost of
supporting free access to ARV is obviously lower than in the base case, US$38 million compared to
US$59 million.

Inthe "higher estimate" case, the NPVbecomespositive after the eighthyear. The seroprevalencerate
reaches 3.44 percent at the end ofthe timeframe. The fiscal cost o f free ARV is higher at $86 million.
Detailed results for both cases are presented intable 2 and 3.

                                     Multi-Sectoral HIVlAIDS Project

The global development objective of project objective is to contain and reverse the trend of the
HNIAIDS epidemic in Mali while providing sustainable access to treatment to those infected by
HIVIAIDS. This project development objective will be achieved by: (i)repositioning strategically the
fight against HIVIAIDS inthe Government development agenda; (ii) level of awarenessthrough
                                                                         raising
implementing a comprehensive sensitization plantargeting schools, firms, communities and the general
public; (iii)
            establishing country-wide access to testing; (iv) providing treatment and care to all HIVIAIDS
infected people; and (v) buildingcapacity in country to benchmark and establish and maintain a M&E
system.

As a category B project, the Government o fMali developed, duringproject preparation, a Medical Waste
Management Plan (MWMP), incompliance with National and World Bank safeguard policies. This study
has been conducted in order to assess project potential negative impacts resulting from project-related
activities and to determine mitigation measuresthat would minimize those negative impacts.

According to the report, current practices inhealth care waste management and contaminated health care
waste handling, storage and disposal, inparticular, raise serious environmental and social concerns. The
need for sound management and disposal o f contaminated medical waste is high, as health care related
                                                                      --
infectious -- as a result of preventive and curative service delivery. The compositiono f waste produced is
activities produce considerable amount o f waste on daily basis         some o f which tend to be highly

inthe form ofsharps (needles, syringes, etc..), non- sharp materials, such as blood and other body fluids
that could be infected, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and medical devises needing proper handling and
disposal. Currently, there is potential for health care workers, waste handlers, users o f health facilities
and the general public to be exposed to and become infected by health care related waste, as a result o f
poor HCW management practices.

The MWMP was prepared by an international consultant, using a broad-based public consultation
approach, involving stakeholder groups in Government organizations, private sector institutions, NGOs
and local communities within the country. The MWMP includes a clear description of project
components, a significant baseline information, policy, legal, administrative and institutional framework
within which the project is to be implemented, an analysis o f potential positive and negative impacts,
institutional arrangements, with clear roles and responsibilitiesfor implementingand monitoringthe plan,
along with its capacity buildingrequirements to effectively mitigate project negative impacts, as well as
enhance its positive ones.
The MWMP benefited from a stakeholder workshop, which was in March. This workshop had a dual
purpose: (i)to foster ownership on the part o f stakeholders; and (ii)      to seek their input in order to
improve the plan. The final draft o f the plan, which reflected stakeholder comments and suggestions, has
beenreviewedand approved by ASPEN andjudged satisfactory. It has been disclosed in-country and at
BankInfoShop prior to appraisal.


The estimated total cost of the environmental risk mitigation under the MAP is in the amount o f
US$946,291, which will be supplemented by other players in the fight against HNIAIDS. The actions
financed under component 4 o f the proposed grant are detailed inthe project cost tables.

Project Preparation

The preparation of this project was financed through a Project Preparation Facility in the amount of
US$500,000 and a Japanese PHRD grant of US$715,000 (TF #052806) executed by the Bank on the
government's behalf.

During project preparation, the team worked closely with the government, the civil society, UNAIDS,
bilateral and multilateral donors and both the local and international private sector to design the project
components as well as implementationarrangements.

Supervision Arrangements

The project will need intensive supervision, given its multi-sectoral and multi-agency nature and large
span o f activities. Moreover, some o f the actors to be involved (Le. community organizations, PLWHA
associations) have relatively limitedexperience with Bank operations.

Some o f the skills requiredfor supervision will be neededon a regular basis while others will be required
on an ad-hoc basis. Therefore, a core supervision team will be established, to be complemented by other
technical specialists, as agreed upon with the recipient. The core team would carry out on average two
three-weeks supervision missions per year, comprised o f approximately 5 staff. Other technical experts
would provide support periodically, as required. Duringthe first year, an intensive supervision program
would be expected, with three missions, taperingdown over subsequentyears.

The Bank's supervision task will be facilitated by the recipient's Monitoring and Evaluation system,
which will be soon set upwith the help o fthe FMA and CMA,

The core team would be comprised o f the following experts from headquarters and from the country
office: (i)task team leader with experience in private sector delivery o f services; (ii) team leader
                                                                                         co-task
with experience in health or HIVIAIDS operations; (iii)    operation officer who would oversee day to day
implementation o f the project in the country; (iv) financial management specialist who would review
adherence to Bank procedures with regard to fiduciary responsibilities; (v) procuremen~implementation
specialist who would be responsible for the procurement, implementationand institutional issues.

The core team would also include representatives from Mali's development partners active in the fight
against HIVIAIDS. Such partners from the at-large UNAIDS group in Mali would be invited to
participate in supervision missions to ensure complementarity o f interventions, build strong partnerships,
andfacilitate a crossfertilization ofexperiences.

The core team would undertake visits to regions at least once a year. For the first year, a total o f 56 Staff
Weeks are planned, of which 20 headquarter's staff weeks, 24 country office staff weeks to emphasize
that the country office assumes greater responsibility for the supervision o fthe project than headquarters.

Mali, with an overall HIV prevalence rate estimated at 1.7 percent is considered as having a low HIV
prevalencerate. Indeed, the relatively low HIV prevalencerate reportedinofficial recordsinthe past few
years reveals a certainstability, as showninthe following table.



                          1992             1994               2001        2002

(pregnant women                            4.5% inSikasso                 amongwomen
only)                                                                     25-29 years old)
Prevalencestudy          3.4% (5% in                          2%
(among all women)        Sikasso)

However there are certain groups who have a very high prevalence rate such as 30 percent among
prostitutes, 6.7 percent among ambulatory women vendors, and 4.1 percent among truck drivers
(CDC/INRSP, 2000). Inaddition, not all regions are affected inthe same way as shown in Fig. 1, This
indicates the need for some targeted interventions, In addition, 25 percent of women declared having a
STD or symptoms relatedto a STD inthe pastyear, a fact which leads to a greater risk of HIV spreading.
All actors agree that Mali should do what it cannow to ensure that it containsthe epidemicsto its present
rate,
                      Figure 1. Seroprevalence rates by region @HS 2001)




                                                                                 111Women

Because first sexual intercourseamong Malian women takes place at a relatively young age and usually
with older men, HIV prevalence inyoung women is higher than inyoung men. As indicated inFigure2,
the Mali DHS (2001) also reveals that adolescent girls (15-19-years-old), young women (20-24-years-
old), and women (25-29-years-old) are disproportionately infected by HIVIAIDS, with prevalence rates

                                                    77

of 1.Ipercent, 1.6 percent, and 3.2 percent, respectively. By contrast, HIV prevalence inadolescent boys
aged 15-19 is 0.3 percent; for young men aged 20-24 it is 0.3 percent, and for men aged 25-29 it is 0.7
percent. Conversely, at older age ranges (45-49-years-old), men are more infected by HIV (2.6 percent)
than women (1.O percent) o f the same age.

The 2002 sentinel 1surveillance data among pregnant women are quite consistent with the 2001 DHS
HIV-prevalence data. The estimated HIV prevalence among pregnant women is 3.3 percent; and women
aged 25-29 account for the highest HIV prevalence (4.8 percent).

It is important to act now when the rates are still relatively low. The example of Cote d'Ivoire, which
shares a border with Mali, is telling: in 1986 only 3 percent of urbanpregnant women were infected, but
this climbedto 8 percenttwo years later, andreached 15 percent in 1991.

A number of factors contribute to the spread of HIV: inadequate knowledge and inappropriate attitudes,
sexuality at an early age, limited availability o f HIVIAIDS-related services, high prevalence o f risky
behavior, importance o f miningand trucking activities, and subordinate status and lack o f empowerment
among women. All those factors are present in Mali, as the followingdata tells:

The DHS I11showed that 60 percent of interviewed men knew of at least two methods to prevent HIV
infection, this leaves 40 percent who did not know. Forty-four percent o f women interviewed said that a
healthy lookingperson could be carrying HIV, this leaves 56 percent who did not know. Only 38 percent
o f men who have a STI said they informed their partner o f the problem. Twenty-four percent o f married
men20-24 years of age have one or more sexual partners inaddition to their wife, Finally, condoms are
not used often, only 14 percent of the women who had a sexual relation with a partner other than their
husbandsaid they useda condom andthis rate was 33 percent among men. Infact only 16percent o fthe
women and 39 percent o f the men interviewed said they would be able to buylobtain a condom. Sexual
activity starts early. At 15 years o f age 27 percent o f girls have already had a sexual relation, and 92
percent of them have it by the time they reach 22 years of age, Women are more prone than men to
having HIV with prevalence rates o f 2 percent and 1.3 percent respectively. Only 17 percent o f married
women said they felt they had a say inthe decisions relatedto their own healthcare.

Government response to the HIVlAIDS challenge

Up to now the response to HIVIAIDS in Mali has been organized mainly by the Ministry o f Health.
However, the health sector suffers from a lack o f demand for services, weak institutional framework and
poor capacity. In 2000, the GOM approved its 2001-2005 National HIVIAIDS Strategic Plan with
financing coming from HIPC money; although the plan calls for a multi-sectoral approach, the
                                                    78

institutional set-up was still led by the MOH. Only in 2004 did the Government take the decision to
change the institutional framework so that the MOHcan concentrateon the essential activities it needs to
undertake, andnot coordinatethe activities ofallthe other sectors.

Behavior Change: Since 1988 the GOM has organized different communication strategies. The NGO
sector works under the coordination of the `Groupe Pivot Sante Population' and PSI. They train peer
educators and cover the regions ofKayes, Koulikoro, Sikasso, SegouandMopti andthe BamakoDistrict.
In2002 there was anetwork of 1,255 peer educators as well as around2,000 community relays. A social
marketingofcondomsprogram is also inplacewhich USAIDandKFW finance until2009.

Prevention of Transmission from Mother to Child (PTMTC): PTMTC was initiated in 2001, and
there are five urban ambulatory sites in Bamako (with the help of Unicef and the Glaxo Smith-Kline
Foundation), of which the Gabriel Toure hospital is the reference center (with the help of ESTHER).
Today only 15 percent of women tested as HIV positive have taken the ARV therapy. The main
problems seem to be lack of equipment (gloves, syringes, disinfectants), little training and motivation of
staff, andpoor-follow upofchildren born to HIV positive women .

Access to Anti-retroviraldrugs: The number of adults with HIV in2001 was estimatedat aminimum
of 104,000 (AIM model, POLICY Project 2002) in a total population of men (ages 15-59) and women
(ages 1549) of 4,765,160 (DHS 2001 report). This number included 14,000 people currently living with
AIDS. It is estimated that by 2010, 500,000 Malians may be infected if prevention efforts are not
significantly increased.

About 1,073 people currently receive ARV therapy in the three reference structures located inBamako
(Point G Hospital, Gabriel Toure Hospital, CESAC). Inearly 2004, a treatment center outside Bamako,
in Segou, was opened with the help of SOLTHIS, another one in Sikasso with the help of Plan
International, andanother one inKayes with the helpof ESTHER. The Bristol-Myers SquibbFoundation
will soon help open another center in a district of Koulikoro. These centers were established when the
Mali initiative for access to ARVs +(Initiative Malienne d'Acc6s aux ARV (IMAARV) )) started in
November 2001.

As of today, the only importer of ARVs under the ACCESS program (Le. ARVs that are sold by large
Western pharmaceuticalcompanies for less than market prices) is the "Pharmacie populaire". There are
severe problems of access to ARVs, which are aggravated by the fact that distribution centers are
sometimes out of stock dueto supply difficulties.

CESAC, a NGO which has over 5,000 patients of whom 75 percent would need ARVs, but only 560
patients are under treatment. If drugs were readily available everywhere, patients would not need to go
backto CESAC every 3 months, but they would have to come back only every six monthsfor a periodic
check-up. This would free up time for physicians who prescribe the drugs and they would be able to
consult with new patients, thus reducing the unit cost per patient. In addition, decentralizationof the
supply of care facilities will meanthat patients from the regions will not need to come to Bamako every
time.

The MAP will help increaseaccessto ARVs inthree ways, inadditionto supplementingthe assistance
providedby other donors:
     1. financing generic ARVs that will be imported by private wholesale pharmacists or the
         ((pharmacie populaire )) so that the generic ARV will be available free of charge to patients in
         any pharmacy in Mali. However, due to the risk of resale of ARVs on the black market in
         neighboring countries, it is important to establish a system of control that would prevent such a
         fraudulent situation;

                                                    79

    2. financing the training of distributors and prescribors inthe public andprivate sectors;
    3. organizing training sessions o f the private sector on therapeutic treatment, compliance of norms
         for ARV treatment and opportunistic infections.


TestinP facilities and euuipment

There are three CD4 counting machines respectively at the    ((Hijpital Point G )), at the INRSP laboratory
and in Sbgou. Moreover, there is a lack of reagents for the CD4 count equipment, which makes the proper
administration o f ARVs almost impossible. Currently, Esther pays 50 percent and the Government
covers 50 percent.

The MAP could help make available the technical equipment needed for the proper administration of
ARVs inthe country side. Moreover, there is a compelling needto train people who handle the tests. For
example, even where the technical equipment is available, there is a shortage o f qualified staff to
administer the tests. That is the case for example at the Hijpital du Point G where only one person has
beentrained to handle that activity.

There are now 15 voluntary testingand counseling centers in six regions (Bamako, Sbgou, Mopti, Kayes,
Sikasso, Tombouctou) with the help o f different partners. However, there are problems o f frequents lacks
o ftests anddrugs.

                         Annex 16: The Role of the Private Sector inMAP
                                 Multi-Sectoral HIV/AIDS Project

Private sector involvement inMAPShas primarily focused on HIVlAIDS inthe workplace. The
Mali MAP will adopt a much more comprehensive framework for private sector involvement
(see table in Annex 16) to ensure that no potential for collaboration and synergy remains
unexplored. The Mali MAP is structured along three components: public sector response,
private sector response and civil society response, and supports three cross cutting themes:
prevention and awareness raising, testing and counseling, and access to medication and medical
care. Private sector involvement will be throughout all project components and each ofthe cross
cutting themes, and will be leveraged into five levels of program execution: (i)in the
implementation o fthe project itself; (ii) private provision o fhealth services; (iii)
                                            through                                          through
implementation o f firm level HIVlAIDS programs; (iv) by leveraging project resources with
private sector know-how, distributionnetworks and other physical infrastructure; and (v) through
policy input and sharing o f international best practices at the level o f the HNAC and the newly
createdMaliBusiness Coalition againstHIVlAIDS.

Project implementation:          The MAP'S implementation will be based on the principle of
outsourcing under oversight from the Executive Secretariat o f the High National Council on
HIVlAIDS (ES/"AC).           Private business models will be adopted to plan, execute and deliver
the MAP program to ensure transparency and compliance with fiduciary requirements, as well as
to enhance the quality o f policy and oversight. Specifically, financial management and
procurementlcontract managementwill be contracted out to two separate private firms, acting as
the MAP Financial Management Agency (FMA) and Contract Management Agency (CMA)
respectively; both firms will be recruited on a competitive basis and will be requiredto set up
regional antennas. A private audit firm will be contracted to perform the periodic financial
audits of all MAP financed activities and similarly, monitoring 2% evaluation will be contracted
out to a private firm or NGO. In addition, the ES/"AC            will outsource on a retainer basis a
number of other cross cutting activities to private and NGO contractors, including: training,
accreditation & quality control o f public andprivate service providers, capacity buildingand TA
support for proposalpreparation.

Private provision of public services: Private testing centers, medical laboratories, pharmacies
and clinics are a relatively recent phenomenon inMali. MAP will support a rapid extension of
private provisionof HIVlAIDSmedical services to achieve nationwide access to testing services,
rapid analysis o f test results, and nationwide access to HIVlAIDS related medications and
clinical support, Inpartnership with such organizations as Population Services International, Plan
International, Fondation MCrieux and PharmAccess, private medical centers will be encouraged
to open new facilities on a franchise basis whereby they will be provided with a package o f
support services including TA to improve technical skills and management capacity, financial
assistance for facility improvements and purchase o f key equipment, and regular quality control
to ensure that a series o f minimum performance standards are beingrespected. Franchiseeswill
provide their services under output based contracts and will benefit from a seal o f approval
system, marketing and media promotion campaigns, and client referrals from other MAP
components. Franchised HIV testing centers will be either "free-standing" sites in high traffic
areas or part o f institutions that already provide health-related services. Personnel will be trained
                                                  81

and accredited to provide on-site, state-of-the-art rapid HIV testing, combined with pre- and
post-test counseling sessions that include .referrals - when needed - to nearby clinics and
community support groups, including PLWHA. Franchised medical laboratories will be linked
with a private reference laboratory in Bamako and their staff will be trained and accredited to
carry out testing and medical monitoring. For nationwide drug delivery MAP will capitalize on
the existing private supply chain, franchising private pharmacies that will be supported by a
network ofprivate distributors to ensure an efficient andreliable supply ofARV's.

Enterprise level HIVIAIDS programs: There is a growing recognition in the business
community that human capital investment costs will increase rapidly if HIV prevalence rates
continue to rise. An increasing number of private enterprises are investing in HIVlAIDS
initiatives for their employees, motivated by cost concerns and a sense of corporate social
responsibility but so far, most o fthese activities have beenisolated and incidental innature. The
MAP will provide incentives for enterprises to adopt a more programmatic and comprehensive
approach for HIV prevention and care. For example, one company is about to implement a
comprehensive action plan which will include: (i)prevention through the free provision of
condoms and the use of specially trained peer counselors to encourage safe sexual behavior and
undergoing HIV testing; and (ii)    guaranteed access to free HIVlAIDS related medications and
clinical support. The program will be complemented by a workers' charter, specifying that job
applicants and employees will not be discriminated against because o f their HIV status.
Employees and their immediate families will be covered at an estimated annual cost of $125 per
individual.

This program can be considered as best practice and MAP will provide incentives to other firms
to adopt a similar approach, using this program as a model. Similarly, MAP will provide
incentives to encourage enterprises to extend part or all o f their HIVlAIDS programs beyond
their employee base to cover their clientele, the surrounding community or society at large. For
example, discussions are underway for a manufacturing firm to open up its company clinic to
provide free HIV testingand counseling services to the surrounding community. While this type
o f comprehensive program may be beyond the reach o f most SME's, there have been some
small-scale attempts by SME associations to provide peer counseling, access to condoms and
other prevention services to their members. Invariably, these activities have been donor driven
and supported on a temporary basis at a local level. MAP financing will be used to scale up
these activities in a sustained manner to cover an increasing number of SME's and their
associations. Inan initial phase, MAP will target associations and federations o f SME's that are
at the core o fthe fight against HIVlAIDS, such as the National Federation ofHotels, Restaurants
andBars, and the trucker associations. The Chamber of Commerce is another strategic partner
and is mobilizing its membership to formulate proposals for pilot and demonstrative initiatives
that couldbe scaleduprapidly.

Leveraging private sector know how and distribution infrastructure: The private sector is
the repository o f some o f the best marketing know how and distribution infrastructure available;
the MAP will act as a catalyst, leveraging project funds with private sector resources to
 accelerate program execution.      Specific examples illustrating the potential for tapping into
private sector humanandphysicalinfrastructure include: Coca Cola which has agreedto share its
marketing expertise with the ES/"AC          to develop an HrVlAIDS communication strategy; a
 local bottling plant which i s planning to share its transport facilities, sales points and storage

                                                   82

network along the major trucking routes to facilitate access to condoms and HIV prevention
messages. The MAP will develop an inventory of private sector resources that are relevant to
program execution andprovide incentives to firms for sharing them.

The MAP will include two key instruments to support private sector HIVIAIDS initiatives: a
Private Sector HIVIAIDS Grant Fund and the Mali Business Coalition against HIV/AIDS.
The former will be a US$2.1 million dedicated fund to provide incentives for private sector
initiatives inpreventiom`awareness raising, testinghounseling, and access to medicationslmedical
care. Grant funds will be channeled to companies directly or through their associations. The
grant fund will essentially be demand driven but, as was mentioned above, MAP will retain
service providers to provide capacity building and support services to stimulate demand by
private sector enterprises and associations, and provide TA to identify, develop and submit sub-
projects for approval, andto assist inimplementation. Proposals for sub-projects o f national or
multi-regional scope, coming from medium or large enterprises or business federations will be
evaluated and approved at national levelby the CMA and financed at national level by the FMA.
Sub-projects o f local scope will be evaluated and approved bythe regional antennas o f the CMA
and financed by the regional antennas o f the FMA. Grant decision making will be based on a
detailed proceduresmanual, specifying the application procedures and selection makingprocess,
and eligibility criteria for beneficiaries, activities and expenditures. Sub-projects from SME's
and SME associationswill be subsidized at 100percent; firm levelHIVIAIDSprograms will be
supported on a matching grant basis, providing a fifty percent subsidy for programs that cover
the firm's employees only, and seventy five percent for programs that extend beyond the
company confines. Financial support for sharingcompany know-how, distribution networks and
other physical infrastructure will be determinedon a case-by-case basis. The mechanism will be
complemented by an intensive communication strategy designed to reinforce the notion that the
private sector canplay a key role inthe fight against HIVIAIDS.

The Mali Business Coalition against HIVIAIDS will provide a core group of enterprises that
have shown particular interest insponsoring HIVIAIDS activities, with a forum to: (i)    exchange
best practices; (ii) expertise and resources; (iii)
                    bundle                                 formulate proposals to scale up isolated
successful interventions to comprehensive national programs; (iv) put existing private sector
expertise, distribution networks and other infrastructure at the disposal o f program execution;
and(v) provide strategic andpolicy input andprogram feedback to the HNAC. To this end, the
Coalition will report directly to the Executive Secretary o f the ESII-TNAC and will be invited to
nominate a representative to the HNAC. In an initial phase, the Coalition will include
particularly dynamic "champions" o f the cause but gradually it will co-opt a broader range o f
participants. A significant portion o f the member firms will be local subsidiaries of
multinationals and hence will have direct access to an international pool o f expertise and
resources which can be put at the disposal o f MAP execution, Several members for instance,
will have subsidiary links to SIDA Entreprise,anetwork ofFrenchfirms with extensive business
holdings in Africa, that are engaged inthe fight against HIVIAIDS. MAP will provide partial
financing for a secretariat and will encourage establishing linkages with similar structures in
C6te d'Ivoire andelsewhere inthe region. The initialwork program o fthe Coalitionwill include
the formulation and adoption o f workers' charters, spelling out the rights o f employees andjob
applicants, building on the work done by Shell and other Coalition members. The Glaxo
Foundation is currently sponsoring a feasibility study o f firm level mutual insurance schemes to
supplement the national health insurance and provide additional medical coverage, inparticular

                                                   83

for HIVlAIDS related expenses. The results o f this study will be fed into the Coalition which,
through one of its member firms, will also draw uponthe experience of the Agha Khan group of
enterprises inCBte d'Ivoire which has recently introduced a similar scheme.

Aujourd'hui le SIDA n'est pas seulement une maladie; ilest devenu un important problkme de
ddveloppement voire un fldau national. A ce titre, sa gestion devient une mission nationale,
hautementprioritaire et d'une grandeportde stratdgiquepour notre pays.

Avec le paludisme, ilest devenu une des premikres causes de morbiditd et de mortalitd. I1
pourrait constituer A terme une menace pour la stabilitd et la survie de notre pays, parce que
touchant les jeunes, les femmes et les institutions comme c'est ddjzi le cas dans certains pays
africains (education, armde, agriculture, mines, industries, etc..).

Dans ces pays oh le taux de sdroprdvalence ddpasse les 30% , ou 1 personne sur trois est
contaminde, la base de la vie sociale a savoir la famille est dttruite et c'est l'existence m6me de
1'Etat qui est menacde. I1y a 15/20 ans, ces pays avaient les m6mes taux de sdroprdvalence que
ceux du Mali d'aujourd'hui, et pour n'y avoir pas fait le bon choix, ni pris les ddcisions
approprides, des gkndrations ont dtd condamndes.

Pour ne pas tomber dans ces travers et prendrecette responsabilitd lourde de consdquence devant
l'histoire, les autoritts maliennes ont depuis longtemps accordd une certaine prioritd zi la lutte
contre le sida aujourd'hui devenu un dtfi majeur et une prdoccupation permanente pour les
gouvernants. I1 occupe de ce fait une place de choix dans toutes les politiques et strattgies
nationales de ddveloppement mises en place ces dernikres anndes. Ainsi 1'Etude Prospective
Nationale Mali2025, la StratdgieNationale de Luttecontre lapauvretd et le Cadre Stratdgique de
Lutte contre la Pauvretd ont retenu la lutte contre le VIWSIDA comme undes axes stratdgiques
prioritaires de lutte contre lapauvretd.

Par ailleurs le Mali a toujours CtC partie prenante A toutes les grandes conferences et rencontres
sous rdgionales, rdgionales, et internationales sur la lutte contre le VIWSIDA. I1a accept4 les
ddcisions prises, notamment :

Depuis le premier cas de SIDA diagnostiqud au Malien 1985 le pays a mis en place et exdcutd
plusieurs programmes de lutte contre ce fldau, dont trois plans a court et moyen terme (1987-
1988), (1989-1993) et (1994-1998) et un plan stratdgique national (2001-2005) sous la
responsabilitd duministere de la santdavec l'appui d'autres ddpartements ministdriels, la socidtd
civile, quelquesprivds, et les partenaires auddveloppement.

Les rdsultats atteints en terme de rdponse nationale, de personnes traitdes ou supportdes, de
ddveloppement de capacitd, de formation de cadres, de crdations institutionnelles et de structures,
de capitalisation d'expdriences, et de moyens financiers mobilisds et ddpensds sont relativement
tres importants, mais malheureusementtrbs insuffisants au regard de l'dvolution sournoise du
fldau dans le pays.

En effet, les rdsultats de 1'EDSM-I11 (2001) ont mis en dvidence une prdvalence de 1,7%.avec

notifids de 1985 a 2002. Au delh de ce taux de prdvalence dans la populationgdndrale, le cas de
une estimation de 170 000 personnesvivant avec le VIH, 45 000 orphelins et 10 304 cas de sida

certains groupes vulndrables constitue une prdoccupation majeure :professionnelles du sexe, les
transporteurs routiers, les populations migrantes, populations rurales et les enfants. Les rdsultats
d'autres enquCtes spdcifiques restent significatifs quant aux stratdgies et ddcisions que nous
sommes amends a prendre. I1s'agit notamment de 3% (Source : PNLS : Sites sentinelles de la
surveillance dpiddmiologique, 2003) et surtout 49% de prdvalence des ISTNIWSIDA chez les
professionnels dusexe A Sdgou(PNLS-CDC-INRSP, EnquCte ISBS, 2001).

Au vu des rdsultats de l'enquete dtmographique de santt de 2001 (EDS 111), on peut estimer le
taux de sdroprdvalence gdndral a 1,7%, cela ne semble pas 21 priori trks alarmant ; mais la
situation reste particulierement prdoccupante car :i)% des jeunes maliens ne croient pas que le
sida constitue une menace sdrieuse de santd, ii)certains groupes de populations a haut risque ont
des taux de sdroprdvalencetres dlevds, par exemple : 30% chez les professionnelles du sexe, plus
de 10% chez les camionneurs, et iii)l'immigration et la mobilitd rdgionale peuvent Ctre des
facteurs de dtgradationrapide des taux de sdroprdvalencepour atteindre ceux des pays voisins.

Apres ces constats, et mCme si le taux de sdroprdvalencene semblepas alarmant (1,7%-EDSM
I112001), landcessitdpour le Malidepassera lavitesse supdrieures'impose.

Notre vision et notre choix stratdgique volontariste exprimds dans 1'Etude Prospective Nationale
MALI 2025, ainsi que dans les engagements pris lors des conferences rdgionales ou
internationales, nous interpellent   rdagir vigoureusement et a adopter une attitude pro-active
quiconsiste ne pas subir les dvenementsmais plut6t les devancer et agir pour provoquer les
                                                       a                 aG
changements souhaitds.

Pour cela, ila CtC ddcidd d'dlaborer une Politique Nationale de Lutte contre le HIVlSIDApour y
affirmer clairement notre vision, nos ambitions, nos strategies et nos moyens de lutte. Tous les
segments de la vie nationale ainsi que les partenaires au ddveloppement doivent Ctre impliquds
dans toutes les phasesde la lutte. Les moyens institutionnels seront reddfinis en consdquence.

INTRODUCTION

La vision strattgique est celle d'une nation engagte, volontaire et acceptant avec courage ses
responsabilitts devant ce fltau ;ce qui implique que toutes les personnes acceptent le fait que le
VIWSIDA affecte leur vie et leur travail. Elles prennent en compte le SIDA en tvaluant
correctement et en agissant efficacement sur les facteurs de risque, de vulntrabilitt et de l'impact
duVIWSIDA quiles concernentainsi que leursfamilles et leurs communautts.

Cette visionrepose sur les capacitts d'un organe de coordination multisectorielfort dont le rBle
serait {{defaire faire ou d'inciter A faire B travers lardalisation d'un partenariat avec tous les
                 -                           ))
acteurs impliquds :le secteur public, le secteur privt et la socittt civile. Elle exige unemise en
commun des tnergies, des moyens et des exptriences pour enrayer le fltau avec une seule
politique, unseul organe de coordination et unseul mtcanisme de suiviltvaluation .

La finalit6 de lapolitique nationale de lutte contre le VIWSIDA consiste B :

    e    soutenir les communautts pour rtduire le risque et lavulntrabilitt B l'infection,
    e    sauver des vies et soulager la souffrance humaine ;et
    e    atttnuer l'impact global de l'tpidtmie sur le dtveloppement.

Pour atteindre cette finalitt, ilfaut prendreen compte les principes directeurs universels en
matitre de lutte contre le VIWSIDA.

Ces principes directeurs sont fondts sur le respect, laprotection et l'accomplissement des droits
de lapersonne. Saconstruction est articulte autour de cinqprincipes fondamentaw :

         le Gouvernement assume le leadership, mobilise les moyens et assure lacoordination en
         dtveloppant lartponse multisectorielle impliquantdavantage la socittt civile, le secteur
         privt, les collectivittsterritoriales dtcentralistes et avec les partenaires au
         dtveloppement;
         le soutien de l'engagement actif des personnesvivant avec le VIWSIDA ;
         laprise en compte des intgalitts lides aux questions de genre quifacilitent lapropagation
         de l'tpidtmie ;
         I'tquitt, ladisponibilitt et l'accessibilitt financitre pour tous aux mtthodesde
         prtvention, et B l'accts universe1aux soins et aux medicaments qui sauvent des vies, et
         aux rdsultats des dtcouvertes scientifiques.
         laprise en compte duVIWSIDA comme maladie sociale.

I.CONTEXTEETJUSTIFICATION
1.1.    L'Cvolutionet l'ampleur de 1'CpidCmie duVIWSIDA auMalisont tr&s
        prCoccupantes

Aprks le diagnostic du premier cas la maladie n'a cess4 de progresser d'aprbs les diverses
enqustes menCes depuis 1985 : 3% de sCropositifs en 1992 dans l a population gCnCrale ; 52%
chez les professionnelles du sexe.

Dans la surveillance sentinelle en 1994 portant sur les femmes enceintes, il a CtC rCv61C
respectivement lKoulikoro, Sikasso et Mopti 0'6% ;3'5% et 3'2% chez les donneurs de sang le
bilan des annCes 1997et 1999 sont respectivement 2'57% et 2,8%.

Cependant les rdsultats de 1'EDSM-I11 ont mis en Cvidence une prCvalence de 1,7%.avec une
estimation de 170 000 personnes vivant avec le VIH, 45 000 orphelins et 10 304 cas de sida
notifiks de 1985 512002.

Audell dutaux de prtvalence dans lapopulationgCntrale, le cas de certains groupes vulnCrables
constitue une prdoccupation majeure : professionnelles du sexe, les transporteurs routiers, les
populations migrantes, populations males et les enfants.

L a situation aujourd'hui rCv2le que 1'CpidCmie du V I W S I D A auM a l i est de type concentrd.
Si rien n'est fait pour maitriser 1'CpidCmie VIWSIDA, le M a l i sera confront6 aux rCsultats ci-
dessous (Projection E D S M I11sur l'an 2010):

Prks de 500 000 personnes pourraient &re porteuse duvirus ;
    0   diminutionde l'espdrance de vie prbs de 6 ans dufait duSIDA ;
    0   pres de 170000 dCcbs ;
        prks de 150000 orphelins ;
    0   prks de 40 000 sujets souffrant ducouple tuberculose - SJDA ;
    0   25% des lits d'hdpitaux seront occupCs par des malades du SIDA.


1.2.    Les DCterminantsde lapropagationdes ISTNIHlSIDA sont connus
11s se dtclinent en facteurs de la VulnCrabilitC ll'infection et en facteurs de l a vulnCrabilit6 a
l'impact, l'interaction entre les deux Ctant trks forte.

LavulnCrabilitCir l'infectionest d'abord liCe luncertain nombre de comportements et de
pratiques a risque :
    0   le multipartenariat sexuel, les rapports sexuels nonprotCgCs, la sexualit6 prdcoce des
        jeunes.
    0   65% desjeunes ont eu leurs premiers rapports sexuels avant l'iige de 18 ans.
    0   Prksde 20% des gargons ont euplus de 3 rapports sexuels dans les 12demiers mois.
        le dCni de la maladie par la plupart desjeunes (314 desjeunes E D S M 111).
                                                   93

D'autres facteurs contribuant A lapropagation de 1'CpidCmie duVIWSIDA sont d'ordre
biologique, social, culturel et Cconomique :

    0  11est Ctabli aujourd'hui que lafemme prksenteune vulnCrabilitC plus grande au
       VIHlSIDA que l'homme liCe A des facteurs biologiques.

    0  Auplansocial et culturelcertainespratiques comme excision, mariagesprCcoces, le
       ltvirat, le Sororat, la faible utilisation des prkservatifs etc. constituent des facteurs
       importants de diffusionduVIWSIDA.

    a  Les facteurs socio-Cconomiquesrenvoient aufaible niveaududdveloppement
       Cconomiqueavec unPIB de 280 dollars par anet par t&ted'habitant, ce qui ce traduit par
       la faiblesse d'accbs aux soins, les migrations internes et externes des populations
       essentiellementjeunes, le chCimage, lapauvretd, le faible niveau d'bducation et la
       difficult6 d'accbs A l'information.

Les facteurs devulnCrabilitbliCs A l'impact du SIDA.

L'impact macro Cconomique et sectoriel de 1'6pidCmie du VIWSIDA n'a pas encore fait l'objet
d'Ctude au Mali. Cependant, quand on sait que 1'CpidCmie touche essentiellement la tranche des
15-49 ans qui constitue la force vive et productive du pays et que sur 100 maliens au moins 2
sont infect& par le VIWSIDA, l'on peut Cmettre l'hypothbse de l'existence d'un impact
macroCconomiqueet sectoriel nonndgligeable.

 Une Ctude de la Banque Mondiale en 2000 a montrC qu'un taux de prkvalence de 5% entraine
une reduction du PNB par habitant de l'ordre de 0'4% par an, un taux de              lo%, 15%   et 30%
correspond respectivement A une rdduction annuelle 0,8%, 1%et 1'4%. Bienque les effets sur la
croissance tconomique peuvent apparaitre relativement modestes compte tenu du taux actuel de
prdvalence au Mali (1'7%)' on peut s'attendre si rienn'est fait A des impacts plus importants sur
les secteurs socio-Cconomiques essentiels dans les annCes A venir (augmentation de la pauvretC,
baisse des revenus des mCnages, augmentation des frais de santC, baisse de la productionet de la
productivitb au niveau des structuresde production).

Auplaneducation, le VIWSDA peutentraher une augmentationdunombre des orphelins qui
pour lapluspart ont perduunou deux parents qui constituent leurs soutien essentiel enmatibre
de scolarisation.

L'impact ddmographique le plus grave de 1'endCmie du VIWSIDA concerne la rCduction de
l'espdrancede vie. Selon la projectionde 1'EDSM 111, si rienn'est fait pour maitriser 1'CpidCmie
VIWSIDA d'ici 2010, l'espkrance devie comaitra une diminutionde prbs de 6 ans.


1.3.   Les rCponsesnationalesA 1'Cpidbmie du VIHISIDA s'adaptent A son bvolution
ConcentrC initialement au niveaude l'Etat, la lutte contre le SIDA ntcessite aujourd'hui une plus
grande implication de la sociCtC civile et du secteur privt. Elle requiert tgalement le
dCveloppementd'un large partenariat aux plans national, sous rCgional et international.

1.3.1. La rCponsedusecteur public

L e Gouvernement du Mali a mis en place en 1987 un Programme National de Lutte contre le
VIWSIDA (PNLS). Dans le cadre de ce Programme, unPlanA Court Terme 1987-1988 (PCT),
un Plan A Moyen Terme de premibre gCnCration 1989-1993 (PMT1) ont CtC exCcutCs. 11s ont
permis la mise en place d'une politique de stcurisation de la transfusion sanguine, l'amorce d'un
ddpistage anonyme et volontaire et l'information, l'Cducation, la communication en faveur de la
population gtnCrale et de quelques groupes 9 risque dont les professionnelles dusexe.

Une seconde phase relative a la pCriode 1994-1998, a consacre un engagement politique,
mat6riel et financier plus grand du Gouvernement ce qui a permis d'atteindre uncertain nombre
d'acquis. D'importants progrbs ont CtC rCalisCs en matibre de lutte contre les IST. Un plan
stratigique national de lutte contre les IST a CtC ClaborC en 1997, les algorithmes de prise en
charge propos6s par L'OMS et 1'ONUSIDA ont Cte revus et adapt& A la situation malienne.

Unetroisibme phaserelative lapCriode2001-2005, encours actuellement, renforce le caractbre
multisectoriel de la lutte contre l'dpidtmie, l'approche dCcentralisCedes organes et des activitds,
la prise en compte de 1'CpidCmie VWSIDA et ses impacts sur les lieux de travail ; et
l'implication croissantedes organisations non gouvernementales(ONG) et le secteur privC.

Cette phase a enregistrC l'introduction de medicament anti-rdtroviral avec une subvention de
1'Etat A travers 1'Initiative Malienne d'Accbs aux Anti Retro Viraux (IMAARV). On note
l'implication de la communautb par le renforcement de la rdponse locale A travers la mise en
ceuvre de l'initiative((Uncercle    - UneONG D.

L'engagement trbs fort et constant du PrCsidentde la RCpublique a CtC un atout majeur dans la
lutte contre le VWSIDA au Mali, Eneffet, le PrCsidentde la RCpubliquea fait de la lutte contre
le VIWSIDA l'une des priorit& de l'action gouvernementale. Dans ce cadre, ila instruit au
Gouvernement lan6cessitC d'une lutte multisectorielle mieuxcoordonnde.

Au planstructure1:l'inter-sectorialitd se traduit par la participationet l'implication effective de
neuf dtpartements ministtriels qui disposent chacun de points focaux form& en matibre de
VIWDtveloppement et de plans sectoriels de lutte contre le VIWSIDA.

Au planbudgktaire : le Gouvernement de la RCpublique du Mali ddploie des efforts budgktaires
considtrables pour la lutte contre le SIDA dans le cadre duPRODESS et de l'initiative PPTE.

Le Gouvernement a procCdC A la restructuration du PNLS. Dans ce cadre, ila CtC crCC un Haut
Conseil National de Lutte contre le SIDA placC sous la haute prksidence du PrCsident de la
RCpublique. Le bureau de coordination du PNLS a Ctt rattachd au secretariat gtnCral du
Ministbre de la santC. Si des rdsultats apprdciables ont CtC obtenus dans le cadre de ce
programme, ilest A noter que les dtpartements ministdriels autre que la santC n'ont pas CtC
suffisamment mobilisds que neuf departements ministCriels ont ClaborC, au terme d'un long
processus, leurs plans sectoriels de lutte contre le VIWSIDA. S i cette initiative est A saluer et A
encourager, force est de reconnaitre que ces plans prksentent beaucoup de faiblesses, 9 savoir :

       disponibles ;
    e  le manque d'une politique nationale ddfinissant une vision stratdgique nationale

1.3.2. La rCponsede la societe civile

Les ONG et Associations intervenant dans le domaine de la sant6 et de la populationse sont trbs
vite engagdes dans la lutte contre l'dpiddmie     a travers des actions novatrices. Au   titre de ces
actions onpeutrappeler les grandes mobilisations sociales et l'impulsion de lacollaboration avec
les imams, les media traditionnels de communication, l'institution du conseilldepistage
volontaire, la prise en charge globale des personnes vivant avec le VIHlSIDA et l'implication
des pairs Cducateurs.

Les ONG de santd regroupdesau sein du collectif Groupe Pivot SantdlPopulation ont scelle avec
le Ministbrede la Santd a travers la contractualisation unpartenariat dynamique et exemplaire.

La creation du Centre d'Ecoute, de Soins, d'himation et de Conseil (CESAC) gdrd par
ARCAD-SIDA assure actuellement, avec succbs, la prise en charge mddicale et psychosociale
des personnesvivant avec le VIWSIDA. Cette expdrience a fait ressortir l'importance de la prise
en compte des dimensions 6thique etjuridique de l'dpiddmie

Comme acteurs essentiels de la socidtd civile, ilimporte de signaler la participationactive et le
r61e important jout par les Associations des Personnes Vivant avec le VIWSIDA (AMAS et
                                                  96

AFAS)17 dont la contribution a dtd ddterminante pour briser le silence autour de l'dpiddmie.
Elles participent activement aux activitds de prise en charge des personnes infectdes et affectdes
par le VIHISIDA.

Les religieux (ImamsllJldmas et les organisations confessionnelles chrdtiennes) ont apportd une
contributionremarquable dans le domaine de la prdvention, la lutte contre la stigmatisation et la
discrimination.

Les tradipraticiens avec une participation informelle, constituent un recours important dans
l'itindraire thdrapeutique des patients. 11s jouent un r6le dans le domaine de la prdvention, et
notamment celui dutraitement des maladies opportunistes.

Toutefois dans le cadre de cette participation, il convient de relever les forces notamment
l'engagement politique individuelet collectif des membres de la socidtd civile, les procddures de
contractualisation et d'utilisation des fonds, les niveaux de responsabilisation des associations et
ONG et l'opportunitd de couvrir le territoire national enmatikre de lutte contre le VIWSIDA.

Cependant des faiblesses notoires demeurent surtout : les difficultds de coordination et les
lourdeurs administratives, les ddcaissements tardifs (plus d'une annde dans certains cas), les
faibles taux de ddcaissement et la diversitd des interventions avec plus ou moins de
professionnalisme (manque de capacitds et de compdtences, insuffisance de crddibilitd entre
autres).


(( L'Initiative un Cercle, une ONG D, mdme si elle est restde une bonne idde, n'a pas rdpondu
dans la plupart des cas aux espoirs attendus, Beaucoup d'ONG n'ont pu exdcuter correctement
leurs activitds, ou celles quiles ont rdalisdes sur prdfinancement, n'ont pas ttd satisfaites dupoint
de vue des remboursements.L'un des obstacles majeurs a la mise en oeuvre de cette approche a
rdsidd dans le retard pris 9 l'dlaboration des outils et dans la difficult6 de mobilisation des
ressourcesfinancihres par les structures d'exdcution.

1.3.3. La rCponse du secteur privCa CtC faible

Certaines grandes entreprisesde laplace, notamment le groupe CFAO, TOL MALI, MOBIL,
SHELL,TOTAL, ont entrepris des initiatives.
I1s'agit de :

           l'adoption de lacharte engageantl'entreprise 2i sauvegarderle personnel par l'accks 9
           l'infonnation, au ddpistage, aux soins et aux mddicaments. Enplus, certaines chartes

I1est a constater que ces initiatives sont atomistes et concernent plut6t les grands groupes.

Par contre au niveaudes PMElPMIle constat est qu'aucune action d'envergure n'a CtC initite par
ces acteursjusqu'a prCsent. Parmi les raisons de leur non-implication dans l a lutte contre le
VIWSIDA, onpeut citer entre autres :

        l'insuffisance de communicationet de moyens financiers,
        le manque de savoir faire spkcifique,
        la faible apprdciation de l'impact duVIWSIDA sur leurs entreprises.

1.3.4. La mobilisationdes ressourcesaktk insuffisante.

A ce jour, plus de 20 milliards de francs CFA ont CtC investis dans la lutte contre le VIWSIDA
par l'Etat, les bailleurs de Fonds multi et bilatdraux, les ONG. Depuis 2001, une partie
substantielle des ressources PPTE est affectbe notamment a la santC dont une partie importante a
la lutte contre le SIDA. Malgrt ces efforts financiers considdrables, la participation financih-e
nationale est restde en dega des attentes.

1.3.5. Le cadreinstitutionneln'a pas produitles effets escomptks.

Au niveau institutionnel, malgrC le rattachement direct du PNLS au SecrCtariat GtnCral du
Ministbre de la SantC, son bureau de coordination n'a pujouer pleinement sa mission dans le
cadre de la mise en euvre du Plan strattgique national, du fait des nombreuses lourdeurs
administratives et de gestion. L e PNLS, financC en grande partie voire essentiellement zi travers
le PRODESS, a pay6 unlarge tribut au faible taux de mobilisation des ressources financi&res au
niveau des Minist&res de la SantC et du DCveloppement Social, de la SolidaritC et des Personnes
AgCes.

Somme toute, le PNLS n'a pas pu ni atteindre les objectifs sectoriels du Ministbre de la SantC
(par exemple la dCcentralisation de la prise en charge mddicale), ni imprimer vbritablement une
dimension multisectorielle a la lutte contre 1'Cpidtmie duV I W S I D A au Mali.

1.4.    Les ClCmentsdejustification

Au vu des faiblesses souligndes dans l'analyse de la situation et de la progression silencieuse et
sournoise du fltau, le M a l i se trouve aujourd'hui dans l'obligation de relever son niveau
d'intervention, de passer a une vitesse supCrieure et d'harmoniser l a vision au niveau de tous les
acteurs. Pour cela, il faudrait Claborer m e politique nationale de lutte contre le VIWSIDA,
volontariste, multisectorielle et vigoureuse qui affirmera clairement sa vision stratbgique, ses
ambitions, ses stratdgies et ses moyens.



                                                  98

Les grandes orientations de cette politique pourraient &re :

11.LESOBJECTIFSSTRATEGIQUES

Bien que la complexitt du problbme du V I W S I D A ait dCpassC de loin toutes les prCvisions, la
Nation malienne dans toutes ses composantes a pris conscience de l a corrClation entre les
dynamiques de base de 1'CpidCmie et le risque de porter atteinte a la cohCsion sociale.

Ainsi une riposte Clargie A 1'Cpidtmie nCcessite de mieux prCciser les objectifs a atteindre a
travers des strategies contribuant SI l a r6ductiondurisque, de l a vulnCrabilitC et de l'impact.

Cette riposte Clargie crCe des synergies importantes en associant les stratdgies de pr6vention aux
stratdgies de prise en charge et de soutien. Elle vise aussi a faire Cvoluer les normes sociales, ti
attCnuer la stigmatisation et A accroitre l'engagement politique pour s'attaquer aux profondes
disparitds Cconomiques liCes au genre qui sont undes moteurs de 1'CpidCmie.

111.LES DOMAINESPRIORITAIRESETSTRATEGIES

La rdalisation de ces objectifs ndcessite I'dlaboration de stratdgies novatrices, adaptdes aux
besoins actuels de la lutte' et prenant particulibrement en compte les aspects socioculturels et
appliqudes dans les domaines ci-aprbs :laprdvention, la surveillance dpiddmiologique, l'acch au
traitement, aux soins et au soutien, Ethique droits, et VIH, Formation Etudes et Recherche,
                                                                          -

La mise en Oeuvre de ces stratdgies accorderaune attention particulibre aux pauvres, aux femmes,
aux jeunes, aux rdfugids, aux handicapds 21 la population carcdrale, et aux autres catdgories
sociales vulndrables au VIWSIDA.


3.1.   Laprdvention

Laprdvention doit &re le fondement de notre action.

 Les strategiesci-dessoussont retenues :

     o l'amdlioration des mdthodesde communication par :
            o l'amdlioration de l'accbs aux programmes de prdventionde laTME
            o l'amdlioration de l'accbs aux mdthodesde protection avec l'approche socio -

     o le renforcement duddpistageet dutraitement prdcoce des IST


3.2.   L a surveillanceCpidCmiologique

L'appui A la collecte et au traitement des donndes est ndcessairepour mesurer pdriodiquement les
progrhs accomplis.



                                                 102

Ainsi les strategies y affdrentessont :
      o le renforcement dusystbme de notificationdes cas d'IST et de Sida dans les formations
          sanitaires
      o le renforcement de la sdrosurveillance sentinelle
      o l'organisation d'ttudes tpiddmiologiques et comportementalesenparticuliercelle
          d'une enquetenationale de stroprtvalence ptriodique.


3.3.    L'acch autraitement, aux soins et ausoutien


Les soins, l'appui et le traitement aux personnesvivant avec le VIH en particulier aux femmes,
auxjeunes et les enfants rendusorphelins et affectts sont les Cldments essentiels d'une action
efficace.

Les siratkgiespour y pawenir sont     .-

    0   lamise enplace de dispositifs ltgislatifs et financiers pour l'accbs A la gratuitt effective

        socioprofessionnelle, colonie de vacances, loisirs etc..) en faveur des orphelins et enfants
        vulntrables.


3.4.    L'Cthiquedroits,et VIH

La rtalisation des droits universels de la personne et des libertts fondamentales qui a dtk
relativement moins prise en compte dans les strattgies prdctdentes reste indispensable si 1'on
veut rdduire la vulndrabilitd face au VIWSIDA. Le respect des droits des personnes atteintes de
VIWSIDA requiert l'adoption des mesures efficaces.

Les stratdgies de ce domaine repose sur lapromotiond'un environnement ltgislatifetjuridique
favorable a travers:

                                                  103

       VIWSIDA enparticulier.


3.5.   La formation-les Ctudes et Recherche

Tant qu'il n'existe pas de remkde contre le VIWSIDA, ilest essentiel de poursuivre les activitds
de rechercheet de ddveloppement

Les strategies suivantes sont-n6cessaires:
    0  le renforcement ldCveloppementdes capacitds des organisations de la socidtd civile du
       secteur public et privd, de lacommunautd et de leur engagementet responsabilisation

3.6.   La mobilisationdes ressources

Les strategies sont basdes sur :

    o une meilleure utilisationdes ressourcesdisponibles et latransparence dans leur gestion;
    o lacollaboration avec tous les partenairesnationaux (public, privd et sociCt6 civile) et

IV. LECADRE INSTITUTIONNEL ET ROLEDESACTEURS

Dansla dtfinition dunouveaucadre institutionnel, nous devonstenir compte des legonstirtes de
l'analyse de la situation de nos programmes passts et actuels. I1 faut tgalement identifier les
faiblesses lites illa coordination de la dimension multisectorielle, mais aussi celles lites a la
mise en auvre des engagementsprispar le Mali au niveaurtgional, continental et mondial.

4.1.    L e Haut ConseilNational de Luttecontre le Sida (HCNLS)

L e Haut Conseil qui existe deja, doit Ctre modifit dans sa composition et dans son contenu pour
satisfaire les exigences de la politique. I1restera sous la responsabilitt directe duPresident de la
Rkpublique, et comportera une reprbsentation Cgalitaire entre :le secteur public, le secteur Privt
et le secteur de la socittt civile y compris les reprtsentants des associations de PersonnesVivant
avec le VM. Les reprdsentantdes partenaires audtveloppement seront associts.


                                                  105

L e HCNLS aura pour missions d'orienter et ddfinir la politique nationale de lutte contre le sida
au Mali et de faire le plaidoyer pour mobiliser les ressources et les communautds pour la lutte
contre le VIWSIDA.

I1 sera crdd, au sein du HCNLS, un Secrdtariat Exdcutif dont la mission essentielle est de
coordonner l'dlaboration de la politique nationale de la lutte contre le VIWSIDA, sa mise en
ceuvre et sonsuivi-Cvaluation.

Au sein de chaque ddpartementministdrielsera crde une cellule chargde de l'dlaboration duplan
d'action sectoriel, de son exdcution et de son suivi en collaboration avec le secrdtariatexdcutif

4.2.    Le cadre de concertation ddcentralisde:

Afin de mener a bienla politique nationale sur toute l'dtendue duterritoire malien et cela d'une

ou rdajustdes. Elles auront un r61e essentiellement politique de mobilisation et de coordination
des populations et des structures publiques, privdes et de la socidti civile dans leur zone de
couverture. La ddcentralisation de la lutte respectera le ddcoupage administratif actuel : rdgion,

de cercle et de commune.

4.3.    L'organisation de la lutte au niveau du secteur privC

Le secteur privd devra jouer un r6le trks important dans cette nouvelle phase de la lutte. I1sera
reprisentd au niveau de toutes les instances de prise de ddcision (HCNLS et tous les autres
conseils rdgionaux, et des comitds de cercle et de commune).

Toutes les grandes entreprises nationales, ou internationales devraient crder en leur sein des
comitds de lutte et rendre disponible les moyens nkessaires (finances, matdriel logistique et
humain pour la protection de leur personnel et leur famille). Le Conseil Prdsidentiel des
Investisseurs (le CPI) serait fortement sollicitd dans ce sens. Un cadre de coordination et de
concertation sera crde pour faciliter les dchanges inter entreprises avec l'appui de la Chambre de
Commerce et d'Industrie, le ConseilNationalduPatronat Malienentre autre.


4.4.    L'organisation de la lutte au niveau de la sociCtC civile


Les ONG et Associations y compris celles des personnes vivant avec le VIH contribueront
efficacement ti la lutte contre le SIDA. Elles participeront dgalement a travers leurs structures de
coordination et de concertation. Ces structures pourraient se situer aux niveaux national et
ddcentralisd.

           These days, AIDS i s not only a disease. It has become a major`problem o f development
 ifnot a scourge affecting the entirenation. This means that the effort to control it has become a
 national mission, with top priority and with important strategic ramifications for our country.

           Together with malaria, AIDS has become one o f the principal causes o f morbidity and
 mortality. Inthe long term it could become a threat to our country's stability and very survival,
 because it affects the youth population, women, and institutions as it already has in certain
 African countries (education, the army, agriculture, mining, industry,etc.).

           Inthose countries where the seroprevalence rate is over 30 percent, where one person in
 three i s infected, the base o f social life, namely the family, i s destroyed, and the very existence o f
 the State i s threatened. Fifteen to twenty years ago, those countries had the same seroprevalence
 rates as those reported by M a l i today, and through failure to make good choices or to take the
 right decisions generations oftheir citizens have been doomed.

           T o avoid making such errors and having to answer to history for being responsible for a
 similar situation,    the Malian authorities have for a long time been assigning priority to the
 control of A I D S , now a major challenge and a permanent concem for governments. As a result,
AIDS now figures largely in all the country's development policies and strategies put in place in
recent years. For example, the M a l i 2025 National Prospective Study, the National Poverty
 Control Strategy, and the Poverty Control Strategic Framework have all identified the fight
 against HIV/AIDS as one of the priorities o f the strategy to control poverty.

          In addition, Mali has always participated in all the major subregional, regional, and
intemational conferences and meetings on HIV/AIDS control. It has accepted the following
decisions:


          0        The LomC Declaration on HIV/AIDS in Africa adopted by the 36t" regular
                   session o f the Conference o f Heads o f State and Government held in LomC
                   (Togo) from July 10 to 12,2000.
                   The African Consensus and Plan o f Action: leadership to overcome HIV/AIDS
                   inAfrica, adoptedbythe Forumfor African Development CEA-2000.
                   The Abuja Declaration on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Other Related Infections
                   Diseases adopted at the African Summit in Abuja, Nigeria, held from April 24 to
                   27, 2001.
          0        The Declaration o f Commitment on HIV/AIDS adoptedby the Special Session o f
                   the United Nations General Assembly on this topic held from June 25 to 27,
                   2001.
          0        The guiding principles o f coordination o f the control efforts adopted during the
                   International Conference on HIVIAIDS (ICASA 11) held in Kenya in September
                   2003: "One national strategy to control AIDS, one strong coordinating body, and
                   one monitoring and evaluation system."

          Since the first case o f AIDS was diagnosed in M a l i in 1985, the country has instituted
and implemented several programs to control the disease, comprising three short and medium-
term plans (1987-1988), (1989-1993) and (1994-1998) and a national strategy (2001-2005) under
the responsibility o f the Ministry of Health, with the support o f other ministerial departments, o f
civil society, a few private individuals, and the country's development partners.

          The results obtained in terms o f national response, individuals treated or supported,
capacity strengthening, training o f professionals, institution and agency building, capitalization
on experience, and financial resources mobilized and disbursed are relatively very large, but
unfortunately highly inadequate given the stealthy progress o f the disease throughout the country.

           The results o f EDSM-I11 (2001) revealed a prevalence o f 1.7 percent, with an estimated
 170,000 people living with HlV, 45,000 orphans, and 10,304 cases o f AIDS reported between
 1985 and 2002. Beyond this rate o f prevalence in the general population, the case of certain
vulnerable groups i s a major cause o f concern: sex workers, truck drivers, migrant populations,
rural populations, and children. The results o f other specific surveys are significant in terms o f
the strategies and decisions we have to take.          These are 3 percent (Source: PNLS: Sentry
epidemiological surveillance sites, 2003) and above all 49 percent STD/HN/AIDS prevalence
among sex workers in SCgou (PNLS-CDC-INRSP, ISBS Survey, 2001).

          Given the results o f the 2001 demographic health survey (EDS 111), we may estimate the
overall seroprevalence rate at 1.7 percent. This does not seem a priori very alarming, but the
situation gives particular cause for concern because (i)three fourths o f young Malians do not
believe that AIDS i s a serious health threat; (ii)    certain high-risk population groups have very
highseroprevalence rates, for example: 30 percent (sex workers), over 10percent (truck drivers);
and (iii)   immigration and regional mobility may be factors causing seroprevalence rates to
increase to levels similar to those o f neighboring countries.

          Given these issues, and even if the seroprevalence rate does not seem alarming (1.7
percent - EDSM-I112001), M a l i definitely needs to shift into higher gear.

          Our vision and our choice o f a proactive strategy, expressed in the Mali 2025 National
Prospective Study, as also in commitments made during regional or international conferences,
demand that we react vigorously and adopt "a proactive attitude that consists o f not being
overcome by events but rather from forestalling them and talung action to bring about the desired
changes."

          To that end, it has been decided to develop a National HlV/AIDS Control Policy and to
clearly affirm our vision, our ambitions, our strategies and our resources.         All segments o f
national life, as well as the development partners, should be involved inall phases o f fight against
H N / A I D S . The institutional resources will be redefinedto reflect this.

The present draft declaration of a national HIV/AIDS control policy recommends providing free care
and antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) to all patients without any distinction, making Mali the third
African country to have taken this decision after South Africa and Senegal.



                                          INTRODUCTION

          The vision incorporated in the strategy i s that o f a committed nation willingly and
courageously accepting its responsibilities in the presence o f this disease. This means that all
people accept the fact that HIV/AIDS affects their life and their work. They take AIDS into
account when correctly evaluating and effectively addressing the HIV/AIDS risk, vulnerability
and impact factors that concern them as well as their families and communities.

          This vision relies onthe capacities o f a strongmultisectoral coordinating body whose role
would be "to get things done, or to encourage things to be done" through the creation o f a
partnership with all stakeholders:     the public sector, the private sector, and civil society. It
demands a pooling o f energies, o f resources, and o f experiences to eradicate the disease with "one
policy, one coordinating body, and one monitoring/evaluation system."

          The aim o f the national AIDS control policy i s to:

                  support communities to reduce risk and vulnerability to infection
          0       save lives and alleviate human suffering
          0       reduce the global impact o f the epidemic on development

          To achieve this end, we have to take into account the universal guiding principles in the
matter o f HIV/AIDS control.

          These guiding principles are based on respect for and protection and exercise o f the rights
o f the individual. There are five such basic principles:


          0      the Government        takes over leadership, mobilizes resources, and ensures
                  coordination by developing a multisectoral response with greater involvement o f
                 civil society, the private sector, the decentralized territorial communities, and the
                 development partners
         0       support for the active commitment o f persons living with HIV/AIDS
                 awareness o f gender-related inequalities issues that foster propagation o f the
                 epidemic
                 equity, availability, and affordability o f all to methods o f prevention and
                 universal access to care and live-saving drugs and to the results o f scientific
                 research
                 awareness that HIV/AIDS i s a social disease.

I. CONTEXTANDJUSTIFICATION

1.1      The evolution and scale of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Mali are serious causes for
         concern.

         Following the diagnosis o f the first case, the disease has steadily progressed, according to
 the various surveys carried out since 1985: 3 percent o f the general population were seropositive
 in 1992and 52 percentofsex workers.

         The sentinel survey o f pregnant women conducted in 1994 indicated, respectively for
 Koulikoro, Sikasso and Mopti, 0.6 percent, 3.5 percent and 3.2 percent. The percentages for
blood donors in 1997 and 1999 were respectively 2.57 percent and 2.8 percent.

         However, DMSM-I11 results showed a prevalence o f 1.7 percent, with an estimated
 170,000 people living with HIV, 45,000 orphans, and 10,304 cases o f AIDS reported between
 1985 and 2002.

         Beyond the prevalence rate for the general population, the case of certain
         vulnerable groups is a priority concern: sex workers, truck drivers, migrant
         populations, rural populations, and children.

         Today's data reveal that the H N / A I D S epidemic inM a l i i s o f the concentrated type.


         Ifnothingis done to control this epidemic, Mali can expect the following situation by the
year 2010 (EDSM-I11 projections):

         Close to 500,000 persons could be infected, with:


    0   life expectancy curtailed by around 6 years as a result o f AIDS
    0   close to 170,000 deaths
    0   close to 150,000 orphans
    0   close to 40,000 persons co-infected by TB/AIDS
   0    25 percent o f hospital beds occupied by AIDS patients

1.2      The factors determining the propagation of STDs/HIV/AIDS are well known.

         These break down into factors o f vulnerability to infection and factors o f vulnerability to
impact, with a very strong interaction between the two.

1.2.1    Vulnerability to infection i s first and foremost linked to a number o f high-riskbehaviors
and practices:

                  multiplicity o f   sexual partners, unprotected sex, early age o f first sexual
                  encounter
                  65 percent o f young people have had their first sexual encounter before the age o f
                  18
                  Close to 20 percent o f boys have had sexual relations more than 3 times in the
                 past 12 months
                 denial o f the disease by most young people (three fourths - EDSM-111).

         Other factors contributing to propagation o f the HIV/AIDS epidemic are o f a biological,
social, cultural and economic nature.

         It has been established that women are more vulnerable than men to HIVISIDA as a
result o f certain biological factors.

         At the social and cultural level, certain practices such as excision, the kvirat and Sororat
traditions, the sparse use o f prophylactics, etc. are all major factors inthe spread o f HIV/AIDS.

         The socioeconomic factors are related to the low level o f economic development with a
GDP o f US$280per year per capita, resulting in:

         0         l o w levels o f access to health care
         0         internal and external migration o f mostly young populations
         0         unemployment
         0        poverty
         0        l o w educational levels

         0        difficulty o f access to information

1.2.2    Vulnerabilityfactors linkedto the AIDS impact

         The macroeconomic and sectoral impact o f the HIViAIDS epidemic has not yet been
studied inMali. However, when we know that the epidemic mainly affects the 15-49 age bracket,
which represents the country's motive force and productive group, and that at least two out o f
every 100 Malians are infected with HIV/AIDS, we may offer the hypothesis o f the existence o f a
substantial macroeconomic and sectoral impact.

         A 2000 World Bank study revealed that a prevalencerate o f 5 percent leads to a GNP per
capita reduction of 0.4 percent per annum, while rates o f 10 percent, 15 percent, and 30 percent
correspond respectively to an annual reduction o f 0.8 percent, 1 percent, and 1.4 percent.
Although the effects on economic growth may appear relatively modest, given Mali's present
prevalence rate (1.7 percent), we may expect, if nothing i s done, more severe impacts on the
essential socioeconomic sectors in the coming years (increased poverty, lower household
incomes, increased health care costs, lower production and productivity rates for the production
sectors).

         Interms o f education, HIV/AIDS can leadto an increase inthe number o f orphans, most
o f whom have lost one or both parents and thereby             their essential support where school
attendance i s concerned.

        The most serious demographic impact o f the HIV/AIDS endemic i s characterized by the
decline in life expectancy. The EDSM-I11projections show that if nothing i s done to control the
HIV/AIDS epidemic by the year 2010, life expectancy will decline by around 6 years.

1.3     Nationalresponsesto the HIV/AIDS epidemic keeping step with its progress

        Initially concentrated at central government level, the effort to control AIDS today
demands greater involvement o f civil society and the private sector.            It also requires the
development o f a broad partnership at the national, subregional, and intemational levels.

1.3.1 Publicsector response

        The Malian government set up a National HIV/AIDS Control Program (PNLS) in 1987.
Within the framework o f this program, a Short-Term Plan 1987-1988 (PCT) and a First

 Generation Medium-Term Plan 1989-1993 (PMT1) were carried out.                    These led to the
 establishment o f a policy for ensuring safe blood transfusions, the start o f anonymous and
 voluntary testing, and information, education, and communication geared to the general
 population and to several high-riskgroups such as sex workers.

           A second phase, covering the period 1994-1998, saw a broader political, material, and
 financial commitment on the part o f the govemment, which led to the accomplishment of a
 number o f results. Major progress was made in the area o f STD prevention. A national strategic
 STD prevention plan was prepared in 1997, the formulas for care and support bvise en charge]
 proposed by WHO and UNAIDS having been reviewed and adapted to Mali's situation.

           A third phase for the period 2001-2005, currently in operation, strengthens the
 multisectoral nature o f the efforts to control the epidemic, the decentralized approach o f agencies
 and activities, factoring in o f the HIV/AIDS epidemic and its impacts on the workplace, and the
 growing involvement o f NGOs and the private sector.

           This phase has seen the introduction of antiretroviral drugs subsidized by the State under
 the Malian Antiretroviral Initiative (IMAARV). The community has become more involved,
 through the strengthening o f local response with implementation o f the "One District, One NGO"
 initiative.

           A major asset inMali's efforts to control the HIVIAIDS epidemic has been the sustained
 and strong commitment on the part o f the President o f the Republic, who has made HIV/AIDS
prevention one o f his government's priority areas o f activity.      Within this framework, he has
urged the government to promote a better coordinated multisectoral campaign.

           At the organizational level, the intersectoral approach is demonstrated by the
participation and effective involvement o f nine ministerial departments, each o f which has
established focal points in the area o f HIV/development and sectoral plans for HIV/AIDS
prevention.

          At the budgetary level, the govemment is deploying substantial budgetary resources for
AIDS prevention within the framework o fPRODESS and the HIPC initiative.

          The govemment has undertakenrestructuring o f the PNLS. It has created a Haut Conseil
National de Lutte contre le SIDA (National High Council for AIDS Control          - HCNLS) chaired
by the President o f the Republic. The PNLS coordination unit has been attached to the General
Secretariat o f the Ministry o f Health. While substantial results have been obtained within the
framework o f this program, it should be noted that departments inministries other than the health
ministry have not been sufficiently mobilized. Nine o f those departments have now, following a
long process, developed their sectoral plans for HIV/AIDS prevention. This initiative i s certainly
laudable and worthy o f encouragement, but it must be recognized that those plans have a large
number o f weaknesses, namely:

8         almost complete absence o f any financial contribution on the part o f the departments
          concerned; all the financing included in their plans has yet to be secured, which conflicts
          with their political commitment to HIV/AIDS prevention
8         failure to factor into the sectoral plans the magnitude o f the HIVIAIDS problem in the
          workplace
e         inadequate preparation and organization on the part o f the ministerial departments to
         handle this new mission, combined with excessive staff mobility, factors that have so far

          prevented achievement o f the expected results in terms o f expanding the national
          response
          failure to take into account the intersecting aspects o f complementarity and synergy o f
          government actions
          lack o f integration o f the resources available within those departments andor the projects
          for which they are responsible
          failure to capitalize on good practices illustrated by the strong tendency o f the ministerial
          departments to develop and disseminate their own IEC support systems and/or to create
          their own AIDS control units at the different levels, when effective tools and experienced
          lenders (NGOs, associations, for example) are available inthe field
          the wide disparity o f the basic data used by the ministerial departments to justify their
          actions, and the over-ambitious and unrealistic nature o f certain objectives
          sluggishadministrative procedures and major delays indisbursingavailable funding
 0        lack o f a national policy defining a national strategic vision developed and adopted by all
          stakeholders.

 1.3.2    Responsefrom civil society

          The NGOs and associations working in the area o f health and population have become
 rapidly involved in the efforts to eradicate the epidemic through innovative programs. Their
 actions have included such actions as large social mobilizations and the promotion o f cooperation
 with the      imams,     the    traditional   communication      media,   institution  o f  voluntary
 consultationhesting, supportive care for individuals living with HIV/AIDS, and the involvement
 ofpeer educators.

         The healthNGOs belonging to the Groupe Pivot SanteYPopulation have sealed a dynamic
 and exemplary contract-based partnership with the Ministryof Health.

         The Center for Listening, Care, Motivation and Advice [Centve dEcoute, de Soins,
d'Animation et de Conseil] (CESAC) managed by ARCAD-SIDA i s doing well as a provider o f
medical and psychosocial care for persons living with HIV/AIDS. This experience has pointed
up the importance of awareness o fthe ethical and legal dimensions o f the epidemic.

         A s essential stakeholders within civil society, it i s important to note the active
participation o f and major role played by the associations o f persons living with HIV/AIDS
(AMAS and AFAS), whose contribution has been a determining factor in breaking the silence
surrounding the epidemic. These associations are active participants in the task o f providing
supportive care for persons infected and affectedby HIV/AIDS.

         The religious bodies and groups (ImamslUlCmas and Christian organizations) have made
a remarkable contribution in the area o f prevention and in helping eradicate stigmatization and
discrimination.

         Traditional practitioners, with their informal approach, represent an important resource in
the therapeutic itinerary o f AIDS patients. They play a role inthe area o f prevention, particularly
inthe treatment ofopportunistic diseases.

        The most important aspects o f this participation are the individual and collective political
commitment o f civil society members, the procedures for contracting and utilizing funds, the
levels o f accountability o f the associations and NGOs, and the need to cover the national territory
inthe area o fHIV/AIDS prevention.

          But there are still very obvious weaknesses: difficulties o f coordination and sluggish
 administrative procedures, disbursement delays (of over a year in some cases), l o w disbursement
 rates, and the diversity o f actions with increasingly less professionalism (inadequate capacities
 and skills, lack o f credibility, among other things).

          The "One District, One NGO" initiative, even while it i s still a good idea, in most cases
 has not met expectations. Many NGOs have not been able to carry out their activities properly, or
 those for which they received prefinancing were not satisfied from the standpoint o f
 reimbursement. One o f the principal obstacles to this approach was the delay inthe development
 of tools, and the difficulties encountered by the executing agencies in mobilizing financial
 resources.

 1.3.3   Poor responsefrom the private sector

         A number o f large corporations established in Mali, such as CFAO, TOL MALI,
 MOBIL, SHELL, TOTAL, have taken a number o f actions, namely:

         0        adoption o f a charter committing the company to safeguard its staff through
                  access to information, testing, care and drugs. In addition, certain charters
                  advocate non-segregation on the hiring o f workers, and that a person infected
                  with HIV/AIDS may not be fired for that reason
         0        development o f communication and sensitizationplans
                  use o f innovative methods for the distribution o f prophylactics
         0        organization o f appropriate training programs through "peer educators."

It shouldbe noted that these actions are fragmented andthat mostly large groups are involved.

         In contrast, it appears that no large-scale action has so far been taken by any SME/SMI.
Among the reasons for this group's noninvolvement inthe efforts to control H N / A I D S are:


         0        inadequate communication and financial resources
         0        lack o f specific know-how
         0        little awareness o f the impact o f HIV/AIDS on their company

1.3.4    Inadequate resource mobilization

         So far, over CFAF 20 billion has been investedinH N / A I D S prevention by the State, the
multi-and bilateral donors, and the NGOs. Since 2001, a substantial portion o f HIPC funds has
been allocated to health, and o f this a large share has been assigned to AIDS prevention. Despite
these hefty financial efforts, Mali's financial participation has not reached expected levels.

1.3.5   The institutionalframework has not yieldedexpected results

        At the institutional level, despite the direct association o f the PNLS with the General
Secretariat o f the Ministry o f Health, its coordination unit has not been able to fully discharge its
mission within the framework o f implementation o f the national strategc plan, owing to sluggish
progress at the administrative and management levels. The PNLS, financed to a large extent, if
not almost in its entirety, by PRODESS, has suffered greatly from the l o w rate o f mobilization o f
funds bythe Ministries ofHealthando f Social Development, Solidarity, andthe Aged.

        Overall, the PNLS has not been. able either to achieve the sectoral objectives o f the
Ministry o f Health (for example, decentralization of medical care) or to impress a true
multisectoral dimension on the assault on the HIViAIDS epidemic inMali.

        Despite the study o f ethical and legal issues concerning HIV/AIDS carried out inOctober
2002, there i s still a legal vacuum in the area o f protection o f the rights o f persons infected and
affected by HIVIAIDS.

1.4     Justification

        Given the weaknesses highlighted in the analysis o f the situation, and the silent and
stealthy advance o f the disease, Mali i s today obliged to raise its level of action, to shift into a
higher gear, and to ensure that all stakeholders share the same vision. To achieve this, it i s
necessary to develop a national HIV/AIDS prevention policy that i s proactive, multisectoral, and
vigorous, and will clearly affirm the country's strategc vision, its ambitions, its strategies, and its
resources.

        The major guidelines o f such a policy could be:

                 the aim o f providing effective free access to care for all patients (checkups, drugs
                 for opportunistic infections, and ARVs)
                 the battle against AIDS can no longer be viewed solely within its medical
                 dimension, but rather within the dimension o f social, economic, and cultural
                 development affecting all sectors
                 the vision should be multisectoral, and involve all segments o f national life
                 (public sector, private sector, and civil society, including the associations, such as
                 those for persons living with HIV, the NGOs and the communities) and the
                 development partners
                 the thrusts o f the strategy should take account o f the evolutionary context o f the
                 disease, the technical aspects o f prevention, testing/counseling, access to care,
                 ethical and legal aspects, issues o f gender-related disparity
                 in the interests o f greater effectiveness and transparency, the policy should
                 respect the major guidelines defined at the I C A S A I1conference: "one national
                 strategy, one coordination body, and one monitoring and evaluation mechanism"
                 involving all partners
                 the HCNLS will be modified to become more representative o f the private sector
                 and o f civil society, and will acquire an Executive Secretariat
                 the existing PNLS will be abandoned in its present form, and will be
                 strengthened and remodeled as the executing agency o f the Ministry o f Health's
                 sectoral action plan
                the battle to control the epidemic will be better structured within the ministerial
                departments thanks to the creation o f a more appropriate and representative
                organization
                innovative management procedures will be introduced or reviewed in order to
                simplify and accelerate the procedures for disbursement and implementation o f
                activities
                a single monitoring and evaluation mechanism will be put in place within the
                HCNLS Executive Secretariat.

11.    STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES

         Although the complexity o f the HIViAIDS problem has far exceeded all projections, the
Malian nation, in all its component parts, has become aware o f the correlation between the basic
dynamics o f the epidemic and the risk o f the breakdown o f social cohesion.

         Thus an expanded counter-attack on the epidemic requires a more detailed elaboration of
the objectives to be achieved through strategies that will help to reduce risk, vulnerability, and
impact.

         Such an expanded counter-attack will create important synergies, by linking prevention
strategies with the strategies for care and support. It also aims to develop social rules, to lessen
stigmatization, and to increase political commitment to assail the serious economic gender-related
disparities that represent one o f the driving forces o f the epidemic.

2.1      Overall objective

         Reduce the propagation o f HIViAIDS in the population, and minimize its impacts on
economic, social, and cultural development.

2.2      Specific objectives

      strengthening o f bilateral and multilateral cooperation
      puttinginplace o f a consultation framework appropriate to the current needs o f the fight
      against the epidemic.

2    PRIORITY AREAS, STRATEGIES

         Accomplishment o f these objectives will depend on innovative strategies appropriate to
the present needs o f the A D I S control battle, with particular attention to sociocultural aspects, and
with application in the following areas:         prevention, epidemiological surveillance, access to
treatment, care, and support, ethics, fights, and HIV, Training - Studies and Research,
mobilization o f resources, monitoring/evaluation, and partnership.

         Such strategies will assign particular attention to women, the poor, the young, refugees,
the handicapped, the prisonpopulation, and other social categories vulnerable to HIViAIDS.

3.1     Prevention

        Prevention must be the foundation for our action.

The following strategies havebeenselected:

        improvement o f methods o f communication through:
        0         improvement o f access to TME prevention programs
        0         improvement o f access to methods o f protection usingthe sociocultural approach
        0         education of the young by their peers
        0        mobilization o f the formal and informal education sectors
        0        utilization o f modern methods o f communication

        promotion o f blood transfusion safety and hygiene inhealth facilities
        access to care and to voluntary and confidential testing services
        strengthening o f testing and early treatment o f STDs

3.2     Epidemiological surveillance

        Support for the gathering and processing o f data i s necessary to facilitate periodic
measurement o f the progress made.

        The strategies to be used include:

        strengthening o f the system for reporting o f cases o f STDs and AIDS in the health
        facilities
        strengthening o f sentinel serosurveillance
        organization o f epidemiological and behavioral studies, in particular a nationwide
        periodic seroprevalence survey.

3.3     Access to treatment, care, and support

The care, suuport. and treatment of uersons living with HIK in particular women, young people
and orphaned and affected children are the essential elements of effective action.

The strategies for accomplishing this are:

                 introduction o f legislative and financial arrangements to enable all patients to
                 have free access to care (checkups, drugs for opportunistic infections, ARVs)

                development o f basic service networks at the community level
                development o f ambulatory treatment and counseling centers
                intensification o f strategies promoting the use o f prophylactics, treatment with
                ARVs, and treatment o f opportunistic infections
                strengthening o f biomedical services
                development o f a network to provide essential drugs (including ARVs) runby the
                public, private, and community health facilities
                ensure the availability, affordability, and geographic accessibility o f therapeutic
                kits
                organization o f in-home care/palliative care
                promotion o f microfinance programs to benefit persons living with HlV and
                families [families d'accueil] fostering orphans and vulnerable children
                contribution to direct action programs (nutrition, clothing, school enrollment,
                social and occupational reinsertion, vacation camps, leisure, etc.) for orphans
                and vulnerable children.

3.4     Ethics,rights,and HIV

        Respect for the universal rights o f the individual and for the fundamental freedoms,
something which to which less attention was paid inearlier strategies, remains essential if there i s
to be a decline in vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. Respect for the rights o f persons living with
HIV/AIDSrequires the adoption o feffective measures.

        Strategies in this area are based on the promotion o f a favorable legislative and legal
environment through:

       enactment and application o f appropriate legislation to protect the rights o f persons living
       with HIV
       strengthening o f existing legislation to put an end to human rights violations and to
       inequalities between men and women
       the taking o f legislative and legal measures to help women and girls to protect themselves
       better
       protection o f children's rights in general and o f children infected with or affected by
       HIV/AIDSinparticular.

3.5    Training-studies andresearch

       Untila remedy for HIV/AIDS is found it is essential that work continue in the areas of
research and development.

       The following strategies are necessary:

       strengthening/development o f the capacities o f organizations o f civil society, o f the
       public and private sector, o f the community, and o f their commitment and accountability
       inthe fight against AIDS
       promotion of studies, o f research in the biomedical areas (vaccines, drugs, including
       traditional medicine), and in the social, economic, cultural, and behavioral areas, to
       expand access to the technologies for prevention and the            care and treatment o f
       HIV/AIDSsufferers, includingthose methods over which women have control
       development of research infrastructure and laboratory capacities

        improvement o f capacities in such areas as surveillance and data gathering, processing,
        and difhsion
        training o f research workers and care providers.

 3.6    Resource mobilization

        The strategies are based on:

        better use o f available resources and transparency intheir management
        collaboration with all      partners, both national (public, private, civil society) and
        intemational, with a view to mobilizing additional financial resources to combat the
        epidemic
        creation and increasing o f headings inthe national budget to combat AIDS with a view to
        facilitating access to diagnosis, care, drugs, and reagents
        Need for the State to support the fight against STDS and HIV/AIDS by allocating
        substantial financial resources from the national budget (?and) sensitization and
        mobilization o f the national and intemational partners to increase subsidies
        HIV/AIDS prevention should receive a larger allocation within the framework o f the
        present debt reduction initiative (HIPC).

3.7     Monitoringand evaluation

        It is essential to preserve the newly created dynamic and to keep up with progress
through the following strategies:

        putting in place of a single monitoring/evaluation system (to preserve the newly created
        dynamic and monitor progress made)
        periodic national evaluation with the participation o f civil society (?in particular
        involving) persons living with HIV,vulnerable groups, and care providers
        development o f surveillance and evaluation mechanisms with appropriate instruments
        strengthening o f the H N / A I D S information system and regular sharing o f information

3.7     Partnership

        To ensure the strengthening o f the national, regional and intemational network o f
cooperation and the creation o f units to coordinate development activities, both moves being
essential factors inHIV/AIDS prevention, the following strategies are proposed:

       expansion o f the response and promotion o f the national and intemational partnership to
       enhance the H N / A I D S prevention effort
       creation o f networks o f experts and institutions
       promotion o f the partnership among the public and private sectors and civil society

IV.    INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK AND STAKEHOLDER ROLES

       Indefiningthe new institutional framework, we musttake account o fthe lessons leamed
from analyzing the status o f our past and present programs.           W e must also identify the
weahesses linked to coordination o f the multisectoral dimension, but also those linked to
implementation o f the commitments made by M a l i at the regional, continental, and world levels.

4.1    TheHaut Conseil National de Lutte contre le SIDA (HCNLS)

          The existing Haut Conseil needs to be modified in its composition and content to meet
policy demands. It will remain under the direct responsibility o f the President o f the Republic,
and will comprise equal representation o f the public sector, the private sector, and civil society,
including representatives o f associations o f persons living with HN. Representatives o f the
development partners will also be associated with the Haut Conseil.

          The HCNLS will be entrusted with guiding and defining the national AIDS prevention
policy and with serving as spokesman in favor o f mobilizing resources and communities in
support o f the fight against HIV/AIDS.

          An Executive Secretariat will be created within the HCNLS, with the basic function o f
coordinating the development o f the national HIV/AIDS control policy, its implementation, and
its monitoring and evaluation.

          Within each ministerial department a unit will be established responsible for preparing
the sectoral action plan, its implementation, and its monitoring, in collaboration with the
Executive Secretariat.

4.2       The decentralized consultation framework

          In order to implement the national policy throughout the entire Malian territory in a
consensual and shared manner the institutional entities already inplace will need to be retained or
adjusted. They will play an essentially political role o f mobilization and coordination o f the
populations and public, private, and civil society institutions in their area o f coverage.
Decentralization o f the fight against AIDS will follow the present administrative setup: region,
district, municipality. T o that end, regional councils and local district and municipal committees
will be put inplace.

4.3      Organization of HIV/AIDS control activities at private sector level

         The private sector will play a very important role in this new phase o f the control effort.
It will be represented at all decision-making levels (HCNLS and all the other regional councils
and the district and municipal committees).

         All the major national and international enterprises should set up their own AIDS control
committees and make the necessary resources available (financial, material, logistical, and
human) to protect their staff and their families. There would be substantial calls for assistance
from the     Conseil Prksidentiel des Investisseurs (Presidential Investors Council - CPI). A
coordination and consultation framework will be set up to facilitate inter-enterprise exchanges,
with the support o f the Chamber o f Commerce and Industry, and the Conseil National du
Patronat Malien (National Malian Employers' Council), among others.

4.4      Organization of HIV/AIDS control activities at civil society level

         The NGOs and associations, including those o f persons living with HIV, will make
effective contributions to the AIDS control effort.      They will also participate through their
coordination and consultation bodies. Those bodies could be established at the national and
decentralized level.

4.5      Stakeholder roles

         The public sector would play a decisive role o f leadership, guidance, mobilization,
motivation, coordination, implementation, monitoring and supervision within the framework o f
implementation o f the national AIDS control policy.

         Given the specific nature o f this infection, private sector (enterprises) have the duty to
play a role in protecting their staff and their immediate families, the users o f their services, and
the populations living within their areas o f influence.       They are responsible for prevention,
testing/counseling, and provision o f care, support, and treatment for their staff infected and
affected by HIV/AIDS.

         Civil society must also play an important role inprevention, social mobilization, support
and assistance for persons living with HIV, orphans, families, medical and psychosocial care and
treatment, in-home care, training, studies, and research.

V.       RESOURCE MOBILIZATION, PROGRAM MANAGEMENT, MONITORING
         AND EVALUATION

5.1      Mobilizationof financialresources

         The effort to combat HIV/AIDS requires efficient and transparent management o f
available funding and mobilization o f new and additional resources.

5.1.1 Internalresources

        All financial possibilities shouldbe explored, inparticular:

        0        annual setting aside by the ministerial departments o f at least 1 percent o f their
                 (?budget - Translator)to finance AIDS prevention efforts
        0        the regional authorities and the decentralized local authorities will contribute to
                 the financing as prescribed in the decentralization legislation: allocation by the
                 local authorities of 7 percent o f their resources to health, o f which 15 percent
                would be set aside for AIDS prevention efforts
        0       the HIV/AIDS prevention effort should receive a larger allocation within the
                framework o f the present debt reduction initiative (HIPC)
        0       development o f alternative financing (mutual savings associations) for health, to
                help with AIDS care and treatment
        0       need for the State to support the battle against STDs and HIV/AIDS by making
                substantial funding available out o f the national budget
        0       greater participation in financing o f the AIDS prevention effort by civil society
                and the private sector
        0       increased solicitation o f national solidarity funding

5.1.2   Externalresources

        0       development o f decentralized cooperation i s one route to investigate
        0       exploration o f new opportunities offered (Global Fund to Fight AIDS,
                Tuberculosis and Malaria) MAP,ADB, etc.
        0       improved coordination o f actions and resources o f the development partners
                (bilateral and multilateral) and the international NGOs
        0       contribution by the extemal private sector, and resources fi-om Malians abroad

5.2     Program management

        The activities will be instituted throughout the country and implemented by the public
and private sectors and civil society, including the communities, which will in particular require
the development o f a national multisectoral strategic AIDS control strategy.

5.3     Management mechanisms and modalities

        The financial resources mobilized should be managed in a flexible, rapid, effective, and
transparent manner. T o ensure that result, management o f those funds should receive asistance
from public and/or private service providers (financial management agency or agence de maitvise
d 'ouvrage de`lkgue`).

5.4     Monitoringand evaluation

        M a l i has several monitoring and evaluation mechanisms within its ministerial
departments.

        Within the framework o f the fight against AIDS, the fact that there are so many
mechanisms could be a source of dispersal, lack o f cohesion, and wastage o f limited program
resources. To be able to accurately monitor the evolution and impact o f the disease and to
maximize the rational use of its limited resources, the HCNLS should promote the development
of "a single well coordinated and high-performing monitoring and evaluation system."         This
system will need to be developed with the participation o f the development partners.
