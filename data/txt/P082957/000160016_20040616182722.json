access to\n            treatment, and care to people infected with, or affected by\n            HIV/AIDS, by strengthening the national response to the\n            epidemic, raising the level of awareness on HIV/AIDS through\n            the implementation of a comprehensive sensitization plan\n            targeting high risk groups, such as youth, sex workers and\n            truck drivers, and, providing sustainable access to testing\n            and counseling facilities, including access to treatment,\n            care and psychosocial support to persons infected with, or\n            affected by the epidemic, and strengthening capacities to\n            address, and maintain an effective monitoring and evaluation\n            system on the epidemic. The first component - support to the\n            public sector response - will help ministries and related\n            public institutions initiate and/or expand the response to\n            HIVIAIDS, by supporting ministries' preparedness, and\n            implementation of sectoral plans that address the challenge\n            of HIV/AIDS with an emphasis on prevention and care. The\n            component will finance, and assist in the preparation of the\n            ministries' action plans for HIVIAIDS control; and\n            capacity building within the Government to manage the fight\n            against HIV/AIDS in a sustainable manner. The second\n            component will leverage the capacity of the private sector,\n            and accelerate the effectiveness of the Government's\n            efforts fighting HIV/AIDS, mobilizing the private sector\n            through the creation of a business coalition against\n            HIV/AIDS, targeting small and medium enterprises (SMEs),\n            emphasizing participation by the informal sector through\n            pilot, and demonstrative initiatives. The objective of the\n            third component is to develop initiatives to combat HIVIAIDS\n            by civil society organizations (CSOs), including community\n            based organizations (CBOs), faith based organizations\n            (FBOs), nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), women and\n            youth groups, associations of people living with AIDS, and\n            other grass roots associations. Capacity building will be\n            reinforced to identify, prepare and implement action plans,\n            and sub-projects. The last component will provide technical\n            support services, equipment and materials, to develop a\n            comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system, including\n            financial and technical aspects, to support epidemiological\n            surveillance, operational research and surveys. A\n            demographic and health survey, and a bio-annual behavioral\n            surveillance survey will be implemented to monitor changes\n            supported by training, and supervision. Certification of\n            laboratories, voluntary counseling and testing, of treatment\n            centers, and pharmacies providing antiretroviral drugs\n            (ARVs) will be ensured."}, "docdt": "2004-05-25T00:00:00Z"}
