Potential large-scale negative impacts could come\n            about because health related activities produce a\n            considerable amount of waste on daily basis as a result of\n            preventive and curative service delivery. The composition of\n            waste produced is in the form of sharps (needles, syringes),\n            non- sharps, blood and other body fluids being infected and\n            non-infected, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and medical\n            devises. Health workers, waste handlers, users of health\n            facilities and the community are all exposed to health care\n            related waste as a result of poor management. A good health\n            care waste management plan could result in healthier\n            communities thereby reducing the cost of health care, as\n            well as creating opportunities for recycling."}, "docdt": "2004-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
