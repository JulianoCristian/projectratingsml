                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The revised project objective is to contribute to the recipient#s multisectoral efforts to control the spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic by improving access to
                         prevention, treatment and care particularly for the most-at-risk-population (MARP) and those infected with or affected by HIV/AIDS. This objective will be
                         achieved by: (a) strengthening the Recipient#s national response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic by improving its evidence base, coordination, implementation, and
                         monitoring and evaluation capacity; (b) raising the level of awareness on HIV/AIDS through the implementation of a comprehensive sensitization plan targeting
                         MARP in particular; (c) providing access to testing and counseling facilities; and (d) providing access to treatment, care and psychosocial support to persons
                         infected with or affected by HIV/AIDS.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Implementation of the MAP-supported action plan of the Ministry of Health should be accelerated, with support from additional technical assistance, to strengthen the capacity of the
                         public sector to provide HIV/AIDS health services especially in the regions. This is important to ensure that the project will meet its development objectives.
