infected or\n            affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Zambia. The project is\n            selective in the support it provides and focuses on the\n            financing of high priority interventions for which\n            significant funding gaps exist. The overall project is based\n            on a new approach for addressing HIV/AIDS by supporting and\n            strengthening community-based responses to the epidemic.\n            There are four components to the project: 1) support for\n            community response to HIV/AIDS (CRAIDS), through financing\n            activities by community based organizations 2) support to\n            the National AIDS Council and Secretariat, 3) support to the\n            line ministries, in order to mainstream HIV/AIDS related\n            activities into the work programs of all line ministries,\n            and finance the Ministry of Health for support\n            implementation activities, and 4) program administration."}, "docdt": "2002-12-11T00:00:00Z"}
