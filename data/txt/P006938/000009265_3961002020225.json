The Project comprises three main\n            components.  (1) Improvements of the Quality of Basic\n            Education would include: curriculum revision, the production\n            and distribution of textbooks, in-service training programs\n            for teachers and administrators, and improvements in\n            physical infrastructure and facilities in the disadvantaged\n            rural regions. (2) Strengthening of Sector Planning and\n            Management specifically in the areas of personnel\n            management, financial and budgetary control, and educational\n            planning to meet the Government's decentralization\n            policies. (3) Improvement in the Quality of Secondary\n            Education could be accomplished by initiating an in-depth\n            study of the present status and needs of secondary\n            education, a two-phase pilot program of computer-assisted\n            education, curriculum revision, and teacher/administrator training."}, "docdt": "1991-10-18T00:00:00Z"}
