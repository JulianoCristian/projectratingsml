Dear Sir:
Ref.: Loan 3414-CR - Basic Education Rehabilitation
Amendment to the Loan Agreement
We refer to the loan agreement dated December 9, 1991 (the Loan Agreement) for the 
above-referenced Loan between the Republic of Costa Rica (the Borrower) and the International Bank 
for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank).
Based on the request made by the Ministry of Education, and exchanges between the Ministry of 
Education representatives and Bank representatives, we propose the following amendments to the Loan 
Agreement:
1. 
Section 1.02 of the Loan Agreement is hereby amended by incorporating new paragraphs (k), (1) 
and (m) to read as follows:
(k) "Juntas
" means the Juntas de Educación
, school boards authorized and regulated under the 
Reglamento
 and "Junta" means any of such school boards;
(l) "Reglamento
" means the Borrower's Reglamento General de Juntas de Educación
, issued 
through the Borrower's Decreto
 No. 17763-E and published in the Borrower's Official Gazette 
No. 198 dated October 16, 1987; and
(m) "Convenio" means each of the agreements to be entered into between the Borrower, through 
the MEP, and a Junta
 pursuant to Section 3.13 (b) of this Agreement;
2.
A new Section 3.13 is hereby added to read as follows:
"Section 3.13 (a) Without limitation to the obligation included in Section 3.01 above, the 
Borrower shall carry out Part A. 5 (i) of the Project with the participation of the Juntas;
(b)  As part of the above, the Borrower shall enter into an agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, 
with each Junta
 providing for the latter's obligations in regard to the rehabilitation of classrooms 
under its responsibility including those related to the compliance with the accounting, auditing 
and procurement provisions set forth in this Agreement; and
(c) The Borrower shall exercise its rights under each Convenio
 in such manner as to protect the 
interest of the Borrower and the Bank, and to accomplish the purposes of the Loan, and, except 
as the Bank shall otherwise agree, the Borrower shall not assign, amend, abrogate, waive or fail 
Page  2
to enforce any Convenio
 or any provisions thereof
3.
The table in Schedule I is hereby amended by incorporating a new subparagraph (e) to read as 
follows:
(e) Under Part A.5 (i) of the Project, unless the Borrower, through MEP, has
entered into the respective Convenio
 with the respective Junta
; and (b) the Bank has received 
evidence, satisfactory to the Bank, that the respective Junta
 has the capacity to carry out the 
rehabilitation of classrooms to be under its responsibility.
This amendment letter shall be executed in two counterparts each of which shall be an original 
and shall become effective on the date in which the Bank has received one fully executed original of such 
amendment letter.
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendment by signing and dating the two 
counterparts of this amendment letter.  Upon your confirmation, please return one fully executed original 
to us.
