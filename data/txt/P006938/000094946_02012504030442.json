Bank\n            performance as highly satisfactory, and Borrower performance\n            as satisfactory. Three external factors had a substantial\n            impact on project implementation: 1) the earthquake of April\n            22, 1991; 2) the economic recession during 1995-1997, and 3)\n            the contesting of contract awards by outside bidders. There\n            are several lessons that can be learned from the project\n            experience: Integration of quality education subcomponents\n            require intensive coordination and additional implementation\n            time. Public-private sector alliances increase project\n            implementation capacity and effectiveness. Continuity of\n            project implementing personnel is key to maintain\n            satisfactory project execution, especially during and after\n            changes in Government administration. Supervision and\n            technical assistance must combine sectoral and\n            administrative issues. To guarantee development objectives,\n            projects must adapt to the changing needs of the education sector."}, "docdt": "2001-12-03T00:00:00Z"}
