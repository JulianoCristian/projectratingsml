REPORT AID RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED LOLN TO MALAYSIA FOR A
SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
.i.       1 submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Malaysia for the equivalent of US$19.5 million to help finance a
Second Highway Project. The loan would have a term of 24 years, in-
cluding h years of grace, with interest at 74 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report was circulated to the Executive
Directors on March 23, 1972(R72-63). An economic mission visited
Malaysia in November/December 1972 and its report will be circulated
shortly. The principal conclusions are discussed below. Country data
for Malaysia are included in Annex I.
3.        During the sixties, the Malaysian economy showed a remarkable
resilience and demonstrated its fundamental strength. The country was
hit by a series of adverse political events - the separation of Singapore
from the Federation of Malaysia in 1965, the confrontation with Indonesia
until 1966, and the communal riots in 1969. In spite of this the Malaysian
economy has continued on a strong and steady course with real GNP growing
at about 6 percent per annum.
4.        The principal factors supporting this growth were increased
exports of rubber, following dramatic production increases in the early six-
ties as a result of massive replantings with improved varieties, and the rapid
rise of timber and palm oil exports. The annual growth rate of export
earnings, principally of primary commodities sales, was 5.3 percent.
Encouragement of import substitution in a context of liberal investment
policies caused manufacturing to grow at about 1 percent a year. NIever-
theless manufacturing accounted for only about 15 percent of Malaysia's
GDP in 1970.
5.        Although Malaysia achieved a satisfactory rate of growth of produc-
tion, the terms of trade deterioration limited the overall growth in real
incomes to about 4.5 to 5.0 percent per annur in West malaysia, which
accounts for about 85 percent of the countryts population. With one of the
highest population growth rates in Asia, West Malaysia achieved only a very
modest increase in real ner canita incomes and consumption of about 1.5-2
percent per-annum. The Government was well aware of the population problem
and since 196h has been increasing its efforts to reduce the population
growth rates.   Due both to these efforts and to a general decline in fert-
ility caused by a trend towards later marriages, the population growth
declined from about 3.3 percent in 1960 to about 2.5 percent in 1970.
Nevertheless, unemployment is at present about 8 percent of the labor force
and a large number of workers, particularly in rural areas,are in low income
jobs.



- 2 -
6.        In the last two years, export earnings have stagnated and
there has been a sharp decline in market priCeS for Malaysia's major
export pinducts.   The key agricultural exports were hit by a declinThi
demand with the value of rubber exports dropping as msuch as '0 percent
between the peak in mid-1969 and the trough in. mid-1972 wien rubber
prices fell to their lowest level since 1947.
7.        The mediui-term outlook for Malaysia's economy, however, appears
favorable. The recovery in industrial countxies in 1972 is increasing the
demand for, &nd the prices of, Malaysia's export produczs and a sound
,nticyclicai budgetary policy which was started by Govemnm.ent irn 1971 - is
b,ginriing to bear fruit.  Also the increase in private investment after
the reestablishment of confidence following the 1969 disturbances is
assistiog -,he recovery. GNP and per capita GNP are forecast to grow at
a rs,. rate in 1973 of about 6 percent and 3.5 percent respective:LY.
8.        Since the racial disturbances of MYay 1969, malaysia?s political
structure has been stable and the ruling position of the Al-izaice Party
virtually unchallenged. However, the debate continues on thie di *a.ritY
between the economic position of Malays and nonl-Malays. The search for
econom.ic and social policies designed to reduce the economic differences
between the two main ethrnic oroups i4s the principal theme Of the Seconci
Malaysia Plen for 1971-75 (SMP). The SMP centers on the Ne- Eco-oic
Policy -hich aims at eradicating poverty and restructuzn     society  so
that   . 7-resent identification of race with particu:Lar .orms of ecenoc
ac I>v --r wiLL: evertually be eliminated. Measures to ;i.pTcm.t "?e policy
are bein;g developed. The SKP seeks ccitinued rapid eccnom c     nsis,.

10.       With adequate external assistance, the financing of the large
increase in Government's development expenditures appears feasible. Govern-
ment revenues are satisfactory (federal revenue accounted for 21.7 percent
of GNP in 1972) and Government can borrow substantial amounts domestically
in a non-inflationary way, especially from the Employees Provident Fund.
The higher expenditure level would require net external loan capital inflows
of about US$125 million a year during the 1971-1975 period. In the past, the
Bank has provided a little less than 40 percent of the public sector's external
borrowing. Bilateral aid, mainly from the U.K., other Commonwealth countries,
and (Crmany, and loans from the Asian-Development Bank provided the rest.
Over the next five years, Japan is expected to become the largest bilateral
donor; a new *36 billion credit line (US$150 million  at the current exchange
rate)was signed in 1972. ADB Ls expected to continue expanding its lending
and also Bank lending is projected to increase in line with Malaysia's total
external borrowing. Disbursed Bank loans outstanding at the end of 1972 amounted
to about 30 percent of Malaysia's total external debt outstanding and disbursed
and would amount at the end of 1978 to about 35 percent.  The estimated require-
ments of loan capital in'low are well within Malaysia's debt carrying capacity.
Debt service obligations at present are about 3 percent of exports of goods
and non-factor services and are estimated not to exceed 7-8 percent during the
s3evnties.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALAYSIA
The Bank has made 22 loans to Malaysia for projects in education,
population, agriculture, forestry, industrial finance, power, water supply,
telecommunications, ports, railways, and urban transport. Although in a
few cases disbursements were slow the execution of these projects has
generally been satisfactory. As of June 30, 1973 the loans to Malaysia
held by the Bank amounted to US$323.1 million. In addition, the Bank made
a loan in 1965 to the Public Utilities Board, Singapore (Loan 405-MA),
guaranteed by Malaysia, to finance the Johore River Project.  The amount
held by the Bank under that loan is US$5.5 million. Annex II contains a
summary statement of Bank loans and IFC investments as of June 30, 1973
and notes on the execution of on-going projects.
12.       Bank assistance to Malaysia is intended to support the Government's
efforts within the framework of the New Economic Policy to redress imbalances
in rural and urban incomes, to create employment for the urban unemployed,
and to reduce rural underemployment. Since Malaysia's land development
programs provide the most effective Government instrument for tackling the
issues of unemployment and inoome imbalance, the Bank will continue to give
financial support to these programs. In addition the Bank will continue to
assist Malaysia in the critical fields of education to increase educational
opportunities for the rural poor and of infrastructure development that will
improve conditions in the urban areas and help support manufacturing.
13.       Despite improved capacity of most departments and agencies to
execute investments, assistance in project preparation and implementation
will still be needed for some time. The Bank has helped the Government to
prepare projects either in the course of its lending operations or by acting
as Executing Agency for UNDP-financed studies. The Bank has also helped
strengthen public agencies responsible for carrying out important parts of
Malaysia's investment program. We will continue this policy which will be



4
reflected in the loans to be presented to the Executive Direcrs in s
next year or so. These loans would be for projects involving drainage,
land settlement, agricultural credit, agricultural research, urban infra-
structure and education. In such sectors as education and agricult-.ure
where the foreign exchange content is typically small, the Bank wil
continue to cover a portion of local costs to assure that the Bank will
be able to participate actively in the implementation of a project.
14.       IFC has bee, acti:ve in Malaysia since 1963 and haas MaQe fi`Te
investments totalling US$8.1 million (Annex II)    The tUCW.a comzltmen z
under those investments held by IFC as of June 30, 1973 amwunted to US$4.2
mlllion. The Corporation is not considering any new invostetn roI ects c
Malaysia at present._   _
PART III - TRANSPORT IN MAIAYSIA
The Tmsns-ort System
15.       West Malaysia's transport system is generally well develoed,;
East. Malaysia has only limited land transport by road and rail.  lhe highway
system totals some 11,000 miles (87 percent paved) in West Malaysia, and some
3,000 miles (19 percent paved) in East Malaysia.   In West M-alasia th -e
Government-owned Malayan Railway operates a total system of 1,036 miles and
is presently carrying out a modernization program to further increase its
efficiency and regain financial viability; in East Malaysia rail services
(by the Sabah State Railway) '4±J.1 be phasidout w0en roads ha-a beenL
improved. The main ports in West Malaysia are Klwng and Penanrg ort
facilities ifa Penang are adequate, those in Kiang are be-ing expandec,.
Long te-rm investment requirements in both ports are plesently- beingr -uied.
A port improvement program, finanaced in part under  ila 77)Q, i.s und9eray

and econIni. activity, the nain transport corridor is 8slo tf,e     -    as .

Snt cevelopment oj' the east coast, including Jarge 1 snd develon:Lent sche ses
sently urder-day or in-. preparation, will increase the import.ance of these
iliows in thne futare.



17.       The SIMP allocates a total of about M$1.2 billion or 16 percent
of all public development expenditures to investments in the transport
sector. This is more than double the amount spent during the First
Malaysia Plan (1966-70), when Government deferred major investment
decisions until the results of a transport survey were available; the
Malaysia Transport Survey was carried out in 1968 and was financed by
UNDP with the Bank acting as Executing Agency. The Transport Survey and
the SMP emphasize the need to improve and extend West Malaysia's existing
transport facilities in all modes and assign in East Malaysia high priority
to the improvement of road and port facilities and in view of the region's
sparse population and difficult terrain, to the provision of air service to
remote areas. The Government is at present carrying out a mid-term review of
the SMP and expects to increase the transport allocation. The two main trans-
port planning agencies have been assisted by two UNDP-financed advisors and
the Government intends to continue the advisory services under bilateral
financing. Among the transport policy matters which are presently under
review are the road user charge system and the road licensing sys-em.
The Highway Network
180       The Transport Survey concluded that West Malaysia's road network,
wlich is relatively well developed in its western part, is generally
adequate for present needs. However, it found that the main traffic
arteries connecting the economic centers of the west coast required
additional capacity to accommodate traffic growth, and assigned highest
priority to these improvements. The Bank accepted the Survey recommenda-
tions and is currently assisting the Government in the widening to six
lanes of part of Route II, the main connection from Kuala Lumpur westwards
to the industrial and residential town of Petaling Jaya and further to the
Port of Klang (Loan 851L-MA). The project is progressing satisfactorily and
the zvain civil works contract has recently been awarded. Improvements of Route
the main north-south artery, would be undertaken under the proposed project.
Outside the west coast corridor, the Government is giving emphasis to improving
east-west connections, partly within the context of regional development
programs. Most of the roads in East Malaysia are in the areas served by ports
and the Government's efforts focus on inter-connecting these roads.
Planning, Financing and Maintenance
19.       The Ministry of Communications has the primary responsibility
for transport planning and policy. Through its own departments or through
supervising Government enterprises, it is concerned with the development
of all modes of transport, except highways. Planning, design and construction
of federal roads, the maintenance of federal roads and the allocation of
maintenance funds for state roads are the responsibility of the Ministry of
Works and Power. State Public Works Departments are responsible for the
highway works approved by State Governments.
20.       The Ministry of Works and Power functions efficiently but its
operations are to some extent constrained by staff shortages. This has
induced the Government to employ consulting firms for project
feasibility and design work. Foreign consulting engineers have been
engaged for larger works and several are currently operating in the
country. Increasing use is being made of the services of the few local
firms and this trend is expected to continue.



-0-
21.       Highway expenditures are financed from general budgetary
resources, supplemented by domestic and foreigrn loans. Highway user
taxes are not earzmarkedbut form part of the general revenue. In West
Malaysia, revenues from these taxes increased faster than road expendi-
tures and in 1971 were nearly five times higher. Reveniues in East
Malaysia equalled the cost of administration and maintenance plus about
half of the road development expenditures.
22.       Highway maintenance is in general satisfactory. There is a
regular good re-surfacing program, but routine or preventive maintenance
needs to be organized more systematically. A Road Maintenance Study, to be
financed under Loan 851-MA  is designed to provide a detailed maintenance
program. It is also expected to identify needed organizational and
operational improvements, as well as equipment requirements, and to propose
methods for a more systematic planning and execution of maintenance works.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
History
23.       The Trarsport Survey identified the need to improve and expand
the capacity of the existing main route on the west coast of Malaysia -
Federal Route I - and provided the basis for the selection of four high
priority sections to be further investigated by consultants under a UNDP-
financed feasibility study. Subsequent detailed engineering of these
sections, of which the construction of two are included in this project,
was financed under Loan 851-MA (see Map 10050R). Improvement of the two
other sections was deferred, the section north of Ipoh because further
technical investigationsare required, including the location and design
of a long tunnel and the selection of the best by-pass of Ipoh, and the
section consisting of the approaches and thoroughfare of Butterworth
because right-of-way problems have to be solved.
24.       The project was appraised in December 1972 and January 1973.
Loan negotiations were held in June 1973 with a delegation led by
Mr. Badruddin Samad, Deputy Under-Secretary, the Treasury. A loan
and project summary is included in Annex III. The Appraisal Report
No. 179a-MA dated July 16, 1973 is being circulated separately.
Description
25.       The proposed project includes 1) the construction and improvement
of two sections of Federal Route I totalling about 90 miles in lengthh;
2) consultant services for (a) detailed engineering of about 22 miles of
Route I and connecting roads in the vicinity of Kuala Lumpur, (b) detailed
engineering of about 200 miles of roads in West and East Malaysia which
may be considered for future financing by the Bank, and (c) town develop-
ment studies for Kuantan and for the region of North-East Negri Sembilan
and an urban road improvement study for Kuala Lumpur.



-7-
26.       Section I of Route I from Kuala Lumpur to Seramban in the south
involves the improvement of about 17 miles of the existing road, the con-
struction of about 38 miles of a four-lane divided expressway, about 3 miles
of two-lane expressway, and of about 5 miles of conaecting and access roads
and two grade separated interchanges. Section II comprises about 25 miles of
selected improvements of the existing two-lane road between Batu caves on
the northern outskirts of Kuala Lumpur and Mi3O of Route I, and 1 mile of connect-
ing road. The designs for the proposed works are acceptable and tho
proposed roads will satisfy traffic requirements in the most econozical way.
It is worth mentioning that the use of labor intensive methods of construction
versus capital intensive methods was reviewed, and that Government decided not
to use the labor intensive techniques because of the higher cost and longer
construction periods. Even at a shadow rate for labor of 50%, the use of
equipment was found to be more economical.
27.       The roads, other ,tan Route I for which detailed engineering would
be financed under the proposed loan will be selected jointly by the Government
and the Bank on the basis of the current review of the Second Malaysia Plan
to be completed by October 1973. The result of feasibility studies carried
out by consultants and the Ministry of Works and Power will be taken into
account. Some of the roads are likely to be in East Malaysia. The urban
development studies consist of two types of study: Town Development studies for
Kluantan on the East Coast and for the region of North-East Negri Sembilan;
and an Urban Road Improvement Study for Kuala Lumpur. The Town Development
Studies are an outcome of the Bank's continuous and deeper involvement in
Malaysia's urban development following the completion of the Klang Valley
Study which dealt with the nation's most advanced region. The studies will
identify measures for the development of secondary growth centers outside
the Klang Valley Region and prepare high priority projects for implementation.
Kuantan could be a major development center in the backward East Coast of
West Malaysia; North-East Negri Sembilan is located close to Route I,
and development of growth centers in its neighborhood could slow down or
reverse migration to Kuala Lumpur, and thus contribute to the achieve-
ment of the national objective of balanced growth. The Urban Road
Improvement Study will identify the measures required for improved traffic
circulation and distribution in Metropolitan Kuala Lumpur, including road
connections between Route II leading into Kuala Lumpur fram the west and
the city's street system.
P'roject Cost and Financing
28.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$37.2 million
of which the Bank would finance the foreign exchange component of
US$19.5 million or53 percent. The cost of Sections I and II is
estimated at US$27.1 million, detailed engineering for additional roads
at US$2.2 million and urban development studies at US$2.0 million.
Contingencies account for the remaining US$5.9 million.
29.       Cost estimates for road construction are based on unit prices
developed by the consultants for each of the work items and checked
against bids received for part of Section I of Route I; cost
es tima tes for construction sup ervision, detail ed engineering and urban
studies are based on recent contracts for similar work in Malaysia.



rimp1ementation, Procurement and Disbursements
30.       The Public Works Department of the Ministry of Works and Power,
will be responsible for the implementation of all project elements except
the town development studies which will be the responsibility of the
Economic Planning Unit. Regarding the road construction works, contract
documents for part of Section I were issued to pre-qualified contractors
in March 1973 and the first contract is expected to be awarded by September
1973. Construction of all works should be completed towards the end of 1976.
The Government has adequate power to acquire the right-of-.ay and no problems
are exsected for the two road sections selected.
31.       Contracts for the proposed road construction end improvement
works wi.ll be awarded to pre-qualified contractors on the basis of inter-
natior-.l competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for
Procur,a.ent. Contracts would range between US$2.3 million and US$6.8
million, which would give Local contractors the opportunity to pa rticipate
in the smaaller contracts. Suitably pre-qualified contractors would be
permitted to undertake more than one section.
32.       The loan will be disbursed against 55 percent of the total
coFt of road constrction and improvement works, representing the
foreign exchange cost of the works, and 100 percent of the foreign costs
of consultants services.
33.       Since costs have been incurred since December 1, 1972 for the
feasibili.ity study and detailed engineering of sections of Route I aud
connecting roads in the vicinity of Kuala Lumpur, it is proposed that
the Bank reimburse the foreign exchange costs of these stuudiesc This
retroactive financing would not exceed US$100,0(YX

The civil works proposed in each section were icentified in
the f.easibility study as initial investments of optimum construction
proaranis to accommodate traffic up to the year 1990. The consultants
i- -stigated the possibilities of phased upgrading of the existing roads
and construction of new roads and compared alternative courses of action
ir ;erirs of their discounted overall costs of road use, maintenan.e and
consTzruction.



-9-
36.       Economic returns for the particular road sections over an
assumed z0-year service life of the invastments range between 20% and
29%. Benefits were determined as the difference in road user and
maintenance costs with and without the project. Time savings for
passengers have been.included in the benefits since their greater
part accrues to persons either on business or home-to-work trips.
However, they are not critical for the justification of the road
sections proposed.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRU14ENTS AND AUTHORITY
37.       The draft Loan Agreement between Malaysia and the Bank, the
report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of
the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the
proposed loan are being.distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
The draft agreement conforms to the pattern normally used by the Bank for
hiFhwp projects.
38.       I am'satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
39.       T recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTIONI/
Ln No. 434   Muda Irrigation Pro ect; US$45.0 Million Loan of
November 17, 1965; Closing Date: December 31, 1973
The project includes the construction of facilities to irrigate
about 260,000 acres of land for double cropping with paddy in the States of
Kedah and Perlis. Physical works are now complete except for some minor
items and corrections. Targets for off-season cropping have been reached
during the first three years of operation. However initial delays in land
acquisition and execution of works required extensions of the original
Closing Date of June 30, 1970.
In No. 500   Kemubu Irrigation Project;  US$10.0 Million Loan of
June 15, 1967; Closing Date: December 31, 1973
The project includes the construction of facilities to irrigate
47,000 acres of land for double cropping with paddy in the State of Kelantan.
Organization and activities of farm associations and cooperatives have progressed
as scheduled and supply of inputs and supporting services are satisfactory. Changes
in investment costs, production areas, estimated yields and prices prompted a re-
calculation of the economic rate of return. The new estimate is about 12% compared
writh 13% during appraisal. Physical works are almost completed except for
field and sub-lateral canals. However, land preparation is about one year
behind schedule. The original Closing Date was June 30, 1972.
In No. 533   Jengka Triangle Project;  US$14.0 Million Loan of
April 17, 196b; Closing Date: December 31? 1975
Ln No. 672   Second Jengka Triangle Land Settlement Project! US$13.0 Million
Loan of May 20, 1970; Closing Date: May 3, 1977
In No. 885   Third Jengka Triangle Land Settlement Project; US$25.0 Million
Loan of March 30, 1973;  Closing Date:  December 31, 19t3
The projects consist of the clearing of forest, the planting of
62,000 acres of oil palms and 35,000 acres of rubber and the settlement of
10,000 families in the Jengka Triangle (State of Pahang). Initial delays in
the land clearance and planting work due to lack of contractors' capacity have
been substantially overcome and implementation is now proceeding satisfactorily.
1/  These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they dc
not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses
in project execution.

, vIo. 673   Jengka Forest Project; Us$8.5 Million Loan o f
May 20, 1970; Closing Date: June 30, l974
Implementation of the project, consisting of a highly complex
integrated forestry products industry established in the Jengka Triangle, has
.uffered because of management and technical problems, which can both' be traced
to the lack of previous experience of this kind in Malaysia. However, corrective
steps have been taken and performance has improved.
in No. 579   Fourth Power Project;  US$8.5 Million Loan of
January 9. 1969;  Closing Date:  March 31, 1974
tn No. 703   Fift1 Power Project;  US$20.0 Million Loan of
juL      130 1, 1975
Implementation of the projects consisting of extensions to
existing thermal plants of the National Electricity Board system is behind
schedule, because of manufacturers' delays, particularly in supplying
structural steels and turbo-alternators.   The Closing Date for in No. 700
will probably have to be ex-ended; the original Closing Date for In No.579
was I,Iarch 31, 1973.
in No. 560   Telecommunications Project;   US$L.  Mi:Lion Loan of
September 27, 1968;  Closing Date: September .30, 197_3
Ln No. 753   Second Telecommunications Project,   US$18.7 Million Loan of
June 21, 1971;  Closing Date: June 30, 1976
The projects include facilities and equipment to improve the
domestic and international telecommunications systems. After initial delays
the project financed under Ln No. 560 is nearing completion and all major
items should be commissioned by September 1973. The delays required two exten-
sions of the original Closing Date of December 31, 1971. Implementation of
the project financed under Ln No. 753 has been slightly delayed but there
are reasonable prospects that it will be completed on schedule.
La No. 561   Kuala Lumpur Water Supply Pro'ect- US$3.6 Million Loan of
Septemer 27,1966;     Closing Date:__September 1,7 1973
Ln No. 908   Second Kuala Lumpu   m Hater Supply Project; US$13.5 Million
Loar of June 14 1973,   Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The projecvs consist of the improvement and expansion of water
supply facilities in t-he Kuala Lumpur area. Implemantation of the first project
had been delayed because the main civil works contract had to be retendered
following the death o-'; the main contractor and the Liquidation of his firm.
However, costs are within the or iginal estimates and work has been completed.
The original Closing Datue waEs September 1, '972. Tenders for the second
project, except for dam construction, have been invited.

Ln No. ')99  Education Project;  US$8.8 Million Loan of
May 23, 1969; Closing Date: December 31, 1974
The project will provide in 21 new schools about 11,000 student
places, of which about 2,500 will be in East Malaysia for secondary education and
teachers training aid about 8,500,mainly in West Malaysia for vocational, technical
and agricultural education.   Project implementation generally is about six
rTonthS behind schedule, due to some siting-projblems and to staff shortages in
the Public Works Department which delayed preparatory design processes, but
is now progressing well. All but one of the 21 project institutions should be
completed by early 1974. A start on the construction of the remaining project
item, one of the three agricultural schools in West Malaysia, has been con-
siderably delayed by difficulties in obtaining a suitable site. Thus an
extension of the present Closing Date will be required. Total project costs
seem likely to be substantially lower than originally estimated and about
US$1.0 million may remain uncommitted.
In No. 810   Second Education Project; US$15.5 Million Loan of
April 5, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Under this project the expansion of technical and vocational
education in Malaysia, started under the first project, will be continued by
the construction of 8 schools (three in East Malaysia), providing 4,700 student
places, and by the establishment at the University of Penang of science
schools providing about 2,600 student places. The project includes also the
establishment of an educational center which will provide a curricula improve-
ment course for teachers and the provision of educational television which
is expected to serve some 500,000 primary and secondary students. Progress
is generally satisfactory and overall project costs are expected to fall
within original estimates.
In No. 774   Sabah Ports Project; US$16.1 Million Loan of
June 30, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
The project consists of the canstruction of new ports at Kota
Kinabalu and Sandakan in the State of Sabah. All civil works contracts have
been awarded and construction has started.
In No. 799   Railway Project; US$16.0 Million Loan of
February 11, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
The project includes mainly equipment and works for a dieseliza-
tion program of the Malayan Railways. Implementation is slightly behind
schedule because of the Railways' unfamiliarity with the Bank's procurement
procedures, but is improving.
Ln No. 851   Kuala Lumpur Urban Transport Project; US$16.C Million Loan of
July 20, 1972; Closing Date: Aprii 30, 1977

Closing Date: September 30, 1977
The project is designed to assist Malaysia in achieving low birth
and population growth rates and thus to contribute to an increase in per capita
income growth and in the long run to ease the unemployment problem.   The United
Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) is providing US$4.3 million in
the form of a grant to finance certain components of the project.
