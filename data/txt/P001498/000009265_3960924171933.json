The relation between the Bank and the Borrower\n            were strained during appraisal of the Fifth Project to the\n            point of jeopardizing the operation itself. Relations\n            improved thereafter but a distant and independent stance can\n            be detected on the part of the Borrower with the minimum\n            necessary flow of information taking place. The favorable\n            evolution of the Borrower's views has been the result\n            of interaction with missions, interaction with consultants\n            and direct absorption of the experience generated. The\n            overlap of the project seems to have allowed almost\n            immediate application of lessons and experience in a way not\n            always possible in stand alone operations."}, "docdt": "1992-05-11T00:00:00Z"}
