                         At mid-term, the overall implementation progress of the project is satisfactory to the Task Team with US$ 2.1 million disbursed (49%), despite delays observed in the implementation
                         of activities in components 1 (land transport) and 2 (maritime transport). As a matter of fact, for component 1, a few activities such as road safety curricula and road safety awareness

                         campaign, are still at the final procurement stage and contract are to be effective by July 15, 2011. Regarding component 2, the draft report for the merchant maritime code is still to
                         be approved before the consultant could move forward with the final draft and eventually the approval process by the Government and the adoption by the Parliament can be
                         launched. As far as component 3 (air transport) is concerned, the new (revised) Civil Aviation Code has been approved and enforced for both legislative and regulatory parts. On
                         another hand, satisfying results have also been achieved in component 4 (overall coordination) with the finalization of the sector policy letter and the launch of a very good M&E
                         platform for the transport sector. As matter of fact, the project has developed a comprehensive sector wide tool to monitor the sector performance. Consequently, the overall
                         implementation progress of the project is considered as satisfactory to the Project Team.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Following the discussions held with the Government, the MTR mission has concluded that:
                         - The PDOs remain relevant and fully achievable by the closing date (September 30, 2012) despite some delays observed but that have been almost absorbed- The project concept,
                         objectives and components remain relevant and there is no need for the project to be restructured-;
                         - The project indicators (target values) remain achievable by the closing date;
                         - The results framework remains relevant.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
