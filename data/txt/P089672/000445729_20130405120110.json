for the Transport Sector\n            Institutional Development and Technical Assistance Project\n            for Mauritania were as follows outcomes were satisfactory;\n            risk to development outcome was moderate; bank performance\n            was satisfactory; borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            There are some of the key lessons learned from this project:\n            (i) early identification of reform champions within\n            government structures; (ii) realistic project objectives;\n            (iii) setting up adequate structures to ensure both

/development partners\n            to ensure alignment and synergies in the transport sector;\n            (vi) adequate implementation time frame for all activities\n            to absorb `force majeure` events; (vii) when conditions are\n            right, standalone ta loans should be considered to modernize\n            / reform the transport sector before engaging in major\n            investment lending. The project development objective as\n            stated in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) was to\n            improve land, maritime, and air transport sector management.\n            The project also sought to strengthen the sector\n            coordination capacity of the Ministry of Equipment and\n            Transport (MET) in order to achieve greater efficiency and\n            effectiveness of Mauritanian transport sector"}, "docdt": "2013-03-14T00:00:00Z"}
