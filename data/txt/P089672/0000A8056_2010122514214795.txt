                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR is based on the findings of the supervision mission carried out between September 25 and September 30, 2010. This is the third supervision mission following the
                         declaration of the Credit effectiveness in December 2009. The overall project status is maintained moderately satisfactory.

                         The mission took note of a good progress, with 1.62 million US$ disbursed (37%) and most activities under implementation and few consultant activities at last stage of procurement
                         stages. Even though overall the results are encouraging, additional efforts and close monitoring are expected from the Government as some activities are still stuck at the

                         procurement stage. Some of these activities are critical for the land transport and maritime transport components.
                         Regarding the sector institutional framework, the mission had the opportunity to meet the authorities of the new STP (Société de Transports Publics) further to the concerns raised by
                         the previous supervision mission. The authorities of the new STP were able to bring clarifications regarding the action plan of the company before it is fully operational. The mission
                         recommends that the creation of the STP be finalized properly in order to make it a formal leader in the transport services market, that could be used as an " engine" to drive the
                         informal transport sector.
