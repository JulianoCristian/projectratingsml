                          1.Landtransport: Rated moderately satisfactory. Mauritania has now a National Road safety strategy (NRSS) which isconsistentwithinternational standards and best practices. That's
                         because the strategy was designed throughout a broad consultativeprocessandreviewed by the Global Road Safety Partnership. As part of the implementation of the NRSS action
                         plan, the broadroadsafetyawareness campaign which was carried out, resulted in high level political commitment, as evidenced by thesystematicmonthlycommunication of the

                         Ministry of Transport at the Council of Ministers on road safety. The NRSS was approved bytheNationaltransportation Commission on May 30, 2012 and is expected to be approved
                         by the Council of Ministers on September 27,2012.A roadsafety database is now available and the preliminary road accidents analysis system is functional. For the
                         roadsafetycurriculumin pilot schools, the Manual is finalized and currently being printed. The formal launch in pilot schools isexpected byOctober2012 ,which is the start of the new
                         school year. Furthermore, the project has financed the editing anddissemination of thehighwaycode for the first time in 40 years, resulting in significant improvement in Drivers'
                         license andvehicle registrationoperations.
                         2. Maritime transport: rated satisfactory. Thanks to the project, the legal and regulatoryframework of the maritimesub-sectorhas been revised and is now consistent with the
                         International Maritime Organization (IMO)conventions ratified byMauritania andthe relevant IMO standards including the provisions of the International Shipping and PortFacility
                         Security (ISPS)Code. Thanks tothe project, the maritime investigation office which was created in 2002 has been equippedand is now functional.The project hassignificantly
                         contributed to strengthening the Directorate of Merchant marine by supportingits reorganization andtrainingprograms in specialized areas.
                         3. Civil aviation: Rated highly satisfactory. The civil aviationcomponent has beenfullyimplemented and outcomes are highly satisfactory. As a matter of fact the project has developed
                         twoactivities thathavesignificant impacts on the aviation sub-sector performance. First, the project has financed the preliminaryanddetailedengineering study for the rehabilitation of
                         the runway. This has allowed the GoM to fund the civil works and itpreventedtheblacklisting of the airport by the EU in 2007. Second, thanks to the project, Mauritania's outdated civil
                         aviation codehasbeenrevised to be consistent with the standards of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). As a result,Mauritaniacivilaviation safety compliance rate
                         improved from 33% in 2008 to 70% in 2012 (further to an ICAO safety audit inApril2012).Mauritania now ranks number seven among African countries and first in the ASECNA
                         group regarding civilaviationsafety.
                         4.Transport Sector coordination: The overall coordination of the transport sector has been strengthened thanks totheproject. Infact, the recently approved Letter of Transport Sector
                         Policy and Transport Strategy Funded by the projecthaveequipped theMinistry with a sector vision and a road map. A transport sector performance monitoring system has been
                         developedforMinistry ofTransport (covering all sub-sectors, no matter the source of funds and whether it is about investments orconsultantservices) andis functional. Furthermore the
                         project provided to the Minister's cabinet an excellent platform for sectorpolicydialog and and agreat opportunity for capacity building for staff.
                         The project implementation status is rated satisfactoryfor thefollowingreasons. All activities have been implemented as per plan, except the purchase of equipment for the road
                         safetyeducationsite.The disbursement`s rate is now at 78.26% and expected to be about 80 % by project closing, despite the 14 monthsdelay of theFAsigning and eventually project
                         effectiveness. As a matter of fact the project was approved by the Board on July 31,2008, butthecredit agreement was not signed until October 1, 2009 due to the "de facto coup" of
                         August 6, 2008. it becameeffectiveonDecember 29, 2009.
                         The project was implemented under by the Ministry of Transport through the Directorate ofStudies,Planning andCooperation in close collaboration with the Directorate General of land
                         Transportation, NationalCivilAviationAuthority(ANAC),Mauritania Airport Management Company (SAM), Merchant Maritime Directorate (DMM). This institutionalanchoringproved
