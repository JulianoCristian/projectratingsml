MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:    Project Completion Report on Korea
Road Improvement Project (Loan 3061-KO)
Attached is the Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Korea: Road Improvement project (Loan
3061-KO, approved in FY89), prepared by the East Asia and Pacific Regional Office with Part II
contributed by the Borrower. The Loan for US$177.21 million equivalent was approved on May 16, 1989
and closed on December 31, 1993, at the date planned. Due to lower than expected costs, US$22.9 million
of the loan was canceled.
The loan was the seventh by the Bank to support the road system in Korea. The objectives were (a)
to enhance transport efficiency by upgrading the surface and alignment of existing roads and by improving
maintenance operations and management; (b) to expand traffic capacity by widening roads in corridors
with high transport demand; and (c) to increase traffic safety through a number of measures: better design
and design standards, new infrastructure work in hazardous locations, intersection improvements,
improvements in traffic safety practices through the development of safety manuals, etc. The project also
included land acquisition, consultant services for construction supervision, and acquisition of equipment for
road maintenance. These were relevant but relatively modest objectives in view of Korea's stage of
development.
The PCR gives an adequate account of project execution. There is, however, no information on
supervision. This is an important omission because the Borrower did successfully manage resettlement and
land acquisition in spite of an unexpected large increase in land prices and some resident opposition to land
acquisition, including litigation in the courts by some residents.  The Borrower managed the land
acquisition successfully and, apparently, without lasting social harm. The factors that contributed to
management success are of general interest to the Bank and should have been investigated or reported.
Although the appraisal dismissed the possible implementation delays and cost increases due to land
acquisition because project components were located in suburban and rural areas, the Borrower, and
especially, the implementing agency, had the skill to marshal the counterpart funds, mobilize staff, and
utilize available legal processes to resolve the problem in a timely fashion.
The increased resettlement costs were largely offset by lower than estimated contracting costs.
Higher than anticipated traffic volumes made the project's economic rate of return higher, from the
estimated 27 percent to 30 percent. The outcome is rated as satisfactory, its sustainability as likely, and its
impact on institutional development as modest.
No audit is plained.

ROAD IMPROVEMENT PROJECT (LOAN 3061-KO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Road Improvement Project, for which
Loan 3061-KO was approved on May 16, 1989 in the amount of US$200 million. US$15 million was
canceled on January 28, 1993, and US$7.79 million was canceled at the time of loan account closing on
February 14, 1994.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division, Country Department I,
East Asia and Pacific Region, as the last Bank Supervision Mission was carried out in April, 1993. The
PCR's findings are based on a review of the documents in the project files at the World Bank and data
provided by the Borrower.






REPUBLIC OF KOREA
ROAD IMPROVEMENT PROJECT (LOAN 3061-KO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation Summarv
Background and Objective
1.          Since 1971, the Bank has supported the Government's initiatives in the highway subsector
with financial and technical assistance through completion of seven highway and expressway projects.
The Road Improvement Project was the sixth highway sector loan the Bank made, and was intended to
support the Government's Sixth Plan (1987-91). The Bank has been involved in the development of the
highway sector since the Government's Second Plan. Loan 3061-KO was signed on November 15, 1989;
was effective on February 6, 1990; and closed on December 31, 1993. The executing agency was the
Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) of the Ministry of Construction (MOC).
2.          The project was designed to support the Government's Sixth Plan, to complete some
initiatives begun under previous Bank-assisted projects and to help to increase transport capacity during
the Sixth Plan period (1987-91) by supporting three principal road-related Government objectives: (a)
enhancing transport efficiency by upgrading the surface and alignment of existing roads and by improving
road maintenance and operations; (b) expanding traffic capacity by widening roads in corridors with high
transport demand; and (c) increasing traffic safety through a number of measures, including safety-
conscious design of project facilities, modification of design standards and practices, where appropriate,
and physical improvement of known hazardous road locations.
3.          The major components of the project were:
(a)    paving, upgrading and widening of about 270 km of the national road system;
(b)    establishment of a new Road Maintenance Management System (RMMS), including
periodic maintenance and rehabilitation of about 700 km of paved national roads;
(c)   implementation of selected aspects of the national road safety program, including safety-
conscious road design, a hazardous location improvement program and preparation of road
safety guidelines; and
(d)   the provision of equipment, consultants' services, and training for road sector development.
4.          The project was comprised of timely and well justified components and while it focused
largely on physical aspects, it also included institutional strengthening in maintenance management and
road safety, which were intended to complete some initiatives begun under previous Bank-assisted
projects. All of these components were well designed to support Sixth Plan objectives.
5.          The project was based on a clear conceptual understanding of the requirements by all
parties and was well designed by the Borrower and the Bank. While not overly ambitious in terms of
focusing on institutional strengthening components like environment and resettlement, which were already
of great concern to the Bank at the time of appraisal in 1988, the scope and scale of the project were



- iii -
appropriate. It was well timed in relation to the highway sectoral objectives of the Sixth Plan. The
design proved efficient in terms of supervision cost, averaging 4.4 staff weeks per year.
Implementation Experience
6.           Overall implementation of the civil works component of the project was satisfactory. While
the project's implementation schedule slipped 5-6 months due to problems with land acquisition, this
problem was solved and the delay was minimized through exceptional efforts by the Borrower. There
was no need to extend the Loan. Once the land acquisition problems were overcome, the problems were
mainly in the contractors' inability to secure adequate supplies of cement and reinforcing steel due to the
very active construction sector in Korea. This caused some construction delays and increases in the cost
of construction. However, difficulties with the supply of materials were overcome through the efforts
of BPR and the contractors. The civil works were completed by October, 1993, within the original loan
closing date.
7.            The road widening component required the acquisition of about 338 ha, including
buildings, and the relocation of 651 families. Resettlement activities were carried out in accordance with
agreed procedures with the Bank. This was accomplished at a total cost of US$295.6 million, including
the cost of land and structures acquired and compensation paid to affected families (owners and renters)
for moving cost, lost wages and other expenses.  These costs were negotiated with the help of
professional consultant valuators in accordance with the Korean Special Law on Acquisition and
Compensation of Lands for Public Use. The vast majority of the affected people negotiated settlements
without disputes. Some disputes, however, resulted in court cases over the amount of compensation to
be paid which did cause appreciable delay in carrying out construction work for some of the project
sections. All disputes were settled, however, in accordance with Korean Law and there are no
outstanding claims. In all cases, monetary compensation was paid to those affected who then made their
own relocation arrangements. In retrospect, it could be that BPR's accumulated experience in land
acquisition from previous projects was the key factor that minimized the delay in the implementation of
civil works.
Results
8.           Overall, the project was successful in meeting its development objectives. Qualitative and
quantitative indicators show the project helped the Government enhance road transport efficiency, road
traffic safety and road maintenance management. About 270 km of the national roads were upgraded and
widened, and about 700 km of pavement were strengthened, which increased capacity and alleviated the
saturated condition of 22 national roads. The project also helped to set up road safety guidelines,
standards and programs. This initiative has been followed-up by the Government very effectively and
institutionalized such that continuous safety improvements are still being made. Thus, the road safety
improvement programs implemented by the project have helped to produce significant reductions in the
number of road accidents. In addition, the RMMS was successfully established and has been in operation
in conjunction with a complete database of paved national roads and has improved the efficiency of
national road maintenance.  Consulting services and technical assistance for this project were procured
by the Government, using its own resources.  Local consultants engaged for both supervision of
construction and land valuation have performed well.  The training component for BPR staff as
contemplated during appraisal was not implemented despite the Bank's effort, although some training
efforts were undertaken by BPR with funding from various sources, including the Government's own
resources. Traffic is increasing faster than forecast on the 22 national roads included in the project, as
this project's investment created additional capacity to accommodate further increases in suburban and
rural national roads. This traffic trend has more than offset the adverse factor in ERRs created by the



- iv -
tripled land acquisition costs of the project, and the demand in traffic seems likely to continue under the
present increases in car ownership, car registration and the current pace of economic growth (7% is
forecast for the 7th Plan period).
Sustainability
9.           The Bank-financed sub-projects are likely to maintain acceptable levels of economical
sustainability throughout their economic life. With regard to national roads included in the project, traffic
is increasing faster than forecast, as this project's investment created additional capacity to accommodate
further increases in suburban and rural national roads.
10.         There is some risk in the institutional sustainability. The project put in place a good
maintenance management program, but the planned training in support of the program was not carried
out. While initial signs are good that the RMMS will be maintained (RMMS continues to be upgraded
by personnel familiar with the system through hands-on work undertaken during the implementation of
the Project), a lack of fully trained professionals could be a problem if not addressed by GOK. Likewise,
while road safety training was not carried out as planned, safety measures taken during implementation
have been significant. Sustainability will be a factor of how well the lessons learned are "handed down"
as time elapses. Further, momentum certainly seemed to be produced, however, further development
in the programs depends on an awareness by Government and continued implementation (paras 29, 30
and 31).
Lessons Learned
I.         Despite the fact that the land acquisition was well executed and did not delay the closing
of the project, there was, in fact, a major lesson to be learned by the Bank concerning the implementation
of land acquisition activities. The possibility of unforeseen difficulties with land acquisition, resulting
in delays in the implementation of the project, was discussed as a possible risk at appraisal. However,
by considering that the necessary land acquisition to be located only in suburban and rural areas, the cost
and schedule were estimated to be moderate, resulting in a significant underestimation of the required cost
and time. This issue had to be solved through exceptional efforts by the Borrower, in terms of securing
counterpart funding and full mobilization of BPR's staff. They utilized their experience and expertise to
minimize delays, as possible disputes and delays were of great concern to the Bank. The Bank needs to
ensure that the cost and scheduling of land acquisitions are more carefully estimated at appraisal when
land acquisition is on the critical path of implementation.

Back2round
1.         Since 1971, the Bank has supported the Government's initiatives in the highway subsector
with financial and technical assistance through completion of seven highway and expressway projects.
The Road Improvement Project was the sixth highway sector loan the Bank made, and was intended to
support the Government's Sixth Plan (1987-91). The Bank has been involved in the development of the
highway sector since the Government's Second Plan. Loan 3061-KO was signed on November 15, 1989;
was effective on February 6, 1990; and closed on December 31, 1993. The executing agency was the
Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) of the Ministry of Construction (MOC).
2.         The Government of Korea's primary sectoral objectives in the past were to increase capacity
and modernize the transport system in line with projected traffic growth. In the early 1980s, however,
the Government recognized that while the nation's transport system was basically in place, transport
investment decisions had become considerably more complex. Although the coordination of investment
plans had been vested in the Ministry of Transportation (MOT) through its Transportation Coordination
Bureau, more comprehensive investment planning and improved coordination among government agencies
was required.  As a result, for a few years preceding the appraisal of this project in 1988, the
Government undertook several studies of various issues with a focus on investment planning. The Urban
Transportation Facilitation Law, enacted in December 1986, provided for MOT, in cooperation with the
Ministry of Construction and Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA), to oversee the preparation of transport
plans for small and large cities and affected suburban areas throughout the country, and for the
establishment of central, as well as provincial-level, transport investment coordination committees to
supervise implementation plans.
3.         Korea had experienced substantial changes in modal distribution during previous Plans, with
the role of road transport becoming more significant. The previously dominant role of railways (82%
of ton-km in 1966) had been replaced by 1985 (when the preparation of this project was started) by a
more balanced distribution of freight traffic among rail, coastal shipping and roads (31%, 29% and 40%,
respectively, in terms of ton-km). For passenger traffic, rapidly expanding personal income generated



-2 -
large increases in personal travel, which as a consequence, contributed to the rapid growth in road
transport (25% in rail and 73% in roads in terms of passenger-km in 1985).
4.          This modal shift provided the rationale for concentrated investment in the highway sub-
sectors for which about 65% of the planned expenditures for the transport sector were allocated in the
Sixth Plan far beyond the allocation to ports (10%) and rail (12%). The budget allocation for national
highways in the Sixth Plan was increased three-fold compared with the outlay on roads in the previous
Plan period, with the focus on extending and widening of paved roads to improve access to the
medium/small cities and rural areas.
5.          The sectoral objectives of the Sixth Plan were to: (a) increase transport efficiency, capacity
and quality; (b) provide regionally balanced transport facilities; and (c) improve transport administration.
The Government sought to achieve these objectives through a more rational distribution of the means of
transport; through efforts to utilize existing facilities to the maximum degree; optimizing new investment
and energy conservation; increasing private sector participation in transport; through investments aimed
at improving transport in the largest cities; and extending the network of paved roads.
6.          These efforts were successful resulting in roads now accounting for the dominant share of
traffic in the transport sector. In 1992, Korea's road network was comprised of about 56,500 km of
roads and some 1,550 km of expressways, and carried about 44 % (ton-km) or 91 % (tonnage) of domestic
freight traffic and about 71 % (passenger-km) or 90% (passengers) of all domestic passenger traffic.
Proiect Objectives and Description
7.          Project Objectives. The project was designed to support the Government's Sixth Plan, to
complete some initiatives begun under previous Bank-assisted projects and to help to increase transport
capacity during the Sixth Plan period (1987-91) by supporting three principal road-related Government
objectives: (a) enhancing transport efficiency by upgrading the surface and alignment of existing roads
and by improving road maintenance and operations; (b) expanding traffic capacity by widening roads in
corridors with high transport demand; and (c) increasing traffic safety through a number of measures,
including safety-conscious design of project facilities, modification of design standards and practices,
where appropriate, and physical inprovement of known hazardous road locations.
8.          Proiect Description. The major components of the project were:
(a)   paving, upgrading and widening of about 270 km of the national road system;
(b)   establishment of a new  road maintenance management system, including periodic
maintenance and rehabilitation of about 700 km of paved national roads;
(c)   implementation of selected aspects of the national road safety program, including safety-
conscious road design, a hazardous location improvement program and preparation of road
safety guidelines; and
(d)   the provision of equipment, consultants' services, and training for road sector development.

Project Design and Organization
9.         The project was comprised of timely and well justified components and while it focused
largely on physical aspects, it also included institutional strengthening in maintenance management and
road safety, which were intended to complete some initiatives begun under previous Bank-assisted
projects. All of these components were well designed to support Sixth Plan objectives.
10.        The capacity increases were important and timely because the improved road infrastructure
still remained a high priority, with significant benefits to be derived from many roads which needed to
be paved or required capacity expansion.  As for the institutional components, road safety and
maintenance systems were areas where Korea's knowledge and experience lagged behind the general level
of development and where external expertise could be inexpensively and successfully applied to Korean
conditions.
11.        The design, appraisal, supervision and reporting were carried out in accordance with detailed
arrangements agreed between the Bank and MOC. In preparation of the upgrading and widening
component, full feasibility studies were carried out on 47 road sections. Agreed criteria were used to
select 21 road sections to be included in the Project from the 47 studies. Since budgets were limited, the
main criteria for a section to be eligible for Bank financing was meeting a minimum 12% ERR. Any
substitutions or additions to be made during project implementation would be on the basis of the same
criteria. Conformity with the criteria was examined and confirmed during supervision by the Bank.
12.        The institutional design and organization of the project focused on MOC's well Cstablished
and mature programs of operational and administrative goals. The responsible government agencies,
particularly BPR in MOC, were qualified, experienced and able to implement the project based on the
Government's objectives and expected project performance.
13.        The project was based on a clear conceptual understanding by all parties of the urgent need
for capacity increases and related institutional development and was well designed by the Borrower and
the Bank. While not overly ambitious in terms of focusing on other institutional strengthening areas like
environment and resettlement, which were already of great concern to the Bank at the time of appraisal
in 1988, the scope and scale of the project were appropriate, and it was well timed in relation to the
highway sectoral objectives of the Sixth Plan.
Project Implementation
14.        The original upgrading and widening program to be financed by the Bank consisted of 21
road sections with a total length of 268.4 km, estimated at the time of appraisal to cost W194.6 billion
(US$278 million equivalent) without contingencies, plus a land acquisition cost of W69.8 billion
(US$99.7 million equivalent). In actuality, as measured during construction, these 21 road sections were
259 km in length and a revised cost estimate, made on the basis of contracts awarded, amounted to
W175.658 billion (US$219.6 equivalent), a savings of over 20% in US Dollar terms. Later, with Bank
concurrence, BPR added another section, 4.1 km long, to the Project which had an estimated cost of
W2.156 billion.
15.        Overall implementation of the civil works component of the project was satisfactory. While
the project's implementation schedule slipped due to problems with land acquisition, this problem was
solved and the delay was minimized through exceptional efforts by the Borrower.  Once the land
acquisition problems were overcome, the problems were mainly in the contractors' inability to secure
adequate supplies of cement and reinforcing steel due to the very active construction sector in Korea.



- 4 -
This caused some construction delays and increases in the cost of construction. However, difficulties
with the supply of materials were overcome through the efforts of BPR and the contractors. The civil
works were completed by October, 1993, without any need to extend the Loan.
16.        The road widening component required the acquisition of about 338 ha, including buildings,
and the relocation of 651 families. Resettlement activities were carried out in accordance with agreed
procedures with the Bank. This was accomplished at a total cost of US$295.6 million, including the cost
of land and structures acquired and compensation paid to affected families (owners and renters) for
moving cost, lost wages and other expenses. These costs were negotiated with the help of professional
consultant valuators in accordance with the Korean Special Law on Acquisition and Compensation of
Lands for Public Use. The vast majority of the affected people negotiated settlements without disputes.
Some disputes, however, resulted in court cases over the amount of compensation to be paid which did
cause appreciable delay in carrying out construction work for some of the project sections. All disputes
were settled, however, in accordance with Korean Law and there are no outstanding claims. In all cases,
monetary compensation was paid to those affected who then made their own relocation arrangements.
In retrospect, it could be that BPR's accumulated experience in land acquisition from previous projects
was the key factor that minimized the delay in the implementation of civil works.
17.        The Government exceeded expectations in carrying out the maintenance components of the
Project. As part of the implementation of the maintenance management system, BPR expanded its
condition survey of the national road network from the original target of 8,235 km to a total of 14,232
km, covering the entire paved network of national roads. This condition survey program now forms a
permanent part of BPR's pavement management system. The periodic maintenance and pavement
strengthening program for a total 637 km which had been established during appraisal was accomplished
by the end of 1992, a much shorter period than expected and of much lower cost. Thus, during 1992,
with Bank concurrence, BPR extended the program to cover 753 km, and BPR has continuing its work
on periodic maintenance and pavement strengthening using its own resources. A total of 695.8 km was
resurfaced under the Bank-financed project. In addition, the Road Maintenance Management System
(RMMS) was successfully established and has been in operation in conjunction with the database for
paved national roads since the RMMS was completed. This has enabled BPR to more accurately identify
and set priorities for maintenance activities necessary to properly maintain Korea's capital investment in
national roads and bridges.
18.        The road safety component was successfully implemented, resulting in a significant reduction
in road accidents in Korea in the following years. The component was completely financed by the
Government and consisted of technical assistance to: (a) review detailed designs applied to all civil works
undertaken under the project, (b) prepare road safety guidelines for Korea, and (c) support MOC in
establishing a program to correct problems at high accident or hazardous locations.
19.        Accordingly, MOC published the Safety Manual for Design in 1989, revised the Standards
of Road Structure and Facilities in 1990, and enhanced safety with major improvements at intersections,
pedestrian walks, road sections with improper alignments and road sections with improper drainage and
skid resistance. In the four years since 1989, 349 sites were improved by utilizing more than W20 billion
from the Government's own budget, resulting in a significant reduction in accident rates, including fatal
and injurious accidents (Part II, 4). Continuous improvements in safety are being made. The police
identified 368 additional sites in 1992, and of these BPR designated 223 locations for physical
improvements. The 1993 program covered 186 locations.
20.        All consulting services and technical assistance for this project were procured by the
Government, using its own resources.

21.        Training of BPR staff was included in the Project, with funding to be provided by the
Government. The program was not implemented, although some training efforts were undertaken by BPR
with funding from various sources, including the Government's own resources.
22.        In January, 1993, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) requested that the Bank cancel US$15
million of the loan. This was due to the cost reductions anticipated by BPR on the basis of bids received
and more current estimates for the road upgrading and widening component. In response to MOF's
request, the Bank canceled US$15 million from the loan as of January 28, 1993, and the Loan Agreement
was amended to a total amount of US$185 million.
23.        In August, 1993, MOF requested that the Bank further cancel US$7.79 million, since BPR
determined that the balance of withdrawal requests would be made in 1993, leaving that amount to be
canceled at the time of final disbursement. The Bank canceled US$7.79 million as of February 14, 1994,
adjusting the total amount of the loan to US$177.21 million.
Project Results
24.        Overall, the project was successful in meeting its development objectives. Qualitative and
quantitative indicators show the project helped the Government enhance road transport efficiency, road
traffic safety and road maintenance management. About 270 km of the national roads were upgraded and
widened, and about 700 km of pavement were strengthened, which increased capacity and alleviated the
saturated condition of 22 national roads. The project also helped to set up road safety guidelines,
standards and programs. These initiatives have been followed-up by the Governrment very effectively and
institutionalized such that continuous safety improvements are still being made. Thus, the road safety
improvement programs implemented by the project have resulted in significant reductions in the number
of road accidents. In addition, the RMMS was successfully established and has been in operation with
a complete database of paved national roads and has improved the efficiency of national road
maintenance. The only component not successfully completed as appraised was the training component.
25.        Specifically, the project was instrumental in accomplishing the following:
(a)   Expanding traffic capacity and enhancing transport efficiency. The US$320 million (or
US$146 million from the Loan) allocated for paving, upgrading and widening of national
roads was satisfactorily used on the 22 sections to increase the capacity of saturated roads
and to improve the accessibility of medium and small cities, and rural areas. The selected
road sections obtained slightly higher ERRs than the estimated ERRs at appraisal, ranging
from 14% to 58% with the weighted average of 30%, compared with a range of 12% to
54% and the weighted average of 27% at appraisal. The higher than anticipated ERR was
achieved despite higher costs for land acquisition due to higher than expected traffic
increases and corresponding VOC savings.
(b)  Improving road maintenance and operations. The US$55.4 million (or US$26.3 million of
which was from the Loan) allocated for the periodic maintenance and pavement
strengthening program was satisfactorily used for 105 sections, with a total length of 695.8
km compared to 637 km at appraisal. In addition, a new road maintenance management
system (RMMS) was established together with surface condition data of all national roads
and has been in operation since its completion. As part of the maintenance component of
the project, a total of US$4.6 million was used from the Loan Account to purchase
maintenance equipment.



- 6 -
(c)   Reducing road hazards and improving safety.  MOC published the Safety Manual for
Design in 1989, revised the Standards of Road Structure and Facilities in 1990, and
incorporated these standards and designs into major safety improvements at intersections,
pedestrian walks, road sections with improper alignments and road sections with improper
drainage and skid resistance. In the four years since 1989, 349 sites were improved by
utilizing more than W20 billion from the Government's own budget, resulting in a
significant reduction in accident rates, fatal and injury accidents. Part II indicates that, in
1992, the annual reduction in the national accident rate was 31.2%, the reduction in fatal
and injurious accidents was 27.4%, and the benefit/cost ratio for nation-wide black spot
improvements was as high as 3.0. Despite this success, the fund for training BPR's staff
on road safety was not used, although some training efforts were undertaken by BPR with
funding from other sources.
Project Sustainability/Remainin2 Issues
27.         The Bank-financed sub-projects are likely to maintain acceptable levels of economical
sustainability throughout their economic life. With regard to national roads included in the project, traffic
is increasing faster than forecast, as this project's investment created additional capacity to accommodate
further increases in suburban and rural national roads.
28.         Sustainability of the works depends on the Government's commitment to a maintenance-first
policy whereby priority is given to allocations for maintenance rather than for new construction.
Maintenance allocations have been gradually increasing each year, expanding from about W80 million
in 1989 to about W140 million in 1993. However, pressure still exists to expand new infrastructure, and
there is a decided risk that maintenance funds would be under-allocated or even reduced if a downturn
in the economy were to require some reduction in future budget allocations.
29.         Traffic is increasing, and traffic congestion has been severely affecting the lives of
pavement, bridge and other road structures of the national roads. Success of the maintenance program
would be realized if the Government would shift the policy on maintenance implementation from
defensive (passive) maintenance to offensive (positive) maintenance. In order to permit BPR to undertake
the level of activities necessary to properly maintain its stock of capital investments in national roads and
bridges, the Government needs to increase its budgetary allocations for maintenance beyond allowing only
for inflationary increases.
30.         There is some risk in the institutional sustainability. The project assisted Government to
construct a foundation for the institutional development in road safety and maintenance management
programs. Further, momentum certainly seemed to be produced, however, further development in the
programs depends on an awareness by Government and continued implementation.
31.         The success of the road safety program depends on the continued implementation and
efficiency of. the physical improvement of hazardous locations. While the success to date has been
significant, the lack of formal training is a small risk to sustainability. GOK must take actions to ensure
that safety continues to be emphasized as it has been since the project began. The accident rates in Korea
have been significantly reduced; however, they are still substantially higher when compared with those
of advanced countries. Measures were taken and showed high performances in reduction of traffic
hazards and improvement of road safety, and thus, further success depends on not only the size and
extension of the program to be implemented in the future, but the efficiency of the measures. BPR, in
coordination with the police, should establish a monitoring program in order to identify/measure the
impact of specific improvements so as to provide feedback for future safety improvement programs.



- 7 -
32.        While the RMMS has been instrumental in making more efficient road maintenance possible,
no training was formally carried out in the maintenance of the RMMS system itself. GOK must ensure
that personnel remain sufficiently knowledgeable of the RMMS system to maintain and update it, in order
that benefits from its use will continue.
Bank Performance
33.        Through the project, the Bank met its objective of promoting the use of resources efficiently
by helping the Borrower focus on continuation and implementation of a sound road improvement policy.
The Bank performance was successful -- proving flexible, quickly incorporating changes as requested by
the executing agency to allow for a successful completion of the project.
Borrower Performance
34.        The Borrower performed well during the challenging period of continuous and rapid
economic growth. BPR managed its programs well, coordinating with related agencies, anticipating each
phase ahead of project implementation, preparing for it and making necessary changes when the situation
demanded. This was especially true when they faced unexpectedly large land acquisition implementation
challeniges.
35.        The Borrower also complied with the Loan Covenants and performed well in achieving
project objectives. There was no significant variation, except the cancellation of US$22.79 million which
was caused by savings in the contract amounts.
Project Relationship
36.        An excellent relationship has existed between the staffs of the Borrower and the Bank,
during both the preparation and implementation phases. The mutual respect and experience gained from
previous projects enhanced the project and contributed to its success. However, it should be noted that
the Bank missions' repeated requests concerning the implementation of training programs did not result
in any action.
Consultinm Services
37.        Consulting services and technical assistance for this project were procured by the
Government, using its own resources. Local consultants engaged for both supervision of construction
and land valuation have performed well.
Project Documentation and Data
38.        BPR has kept good records of the project and provided clear and adequate information
needed to prepare the PCR. All the basic documents needed were also available within the Division.
Lessons Learned
39.        Despite the fact that the land acquisition was well executed and did not delay the closing
of the project, there was, in fact, a major lesson to be learned by the Bank concerning the implementation
of land acquisition activities. The possibility of unforeseen difficulties with land acquisition, resulting
in delays in the implementation of the project, was discussed as a possible risk at appraisal. However,
by considering that the necessary land acquisition to be located only in suburban and rural areas, the cost



- 8 -
and schedule were estimated to be moderate, resulting in a significant underestimation of the required cost
and time. This issue had to be solved through exceptional efforts by the Borrower, in terms of securing
counterpart funding and full mobilization of BPR's staff. They utilized their experience and expertise to
minimize delays, as possible disputes and delays were of great concern to the Bank. The Bank needs to
ensure that the cost and scheduling of land acquisitions are more carefully estimated at appraisal when
land acquisition is on the critical path of implementation.

X Rationales of Cancellation of Overseas Traning Program
When the Korean delegation and the Bank delegation agreed on a draft
Loan Agreement between Republic of Korea and the World Bank in Washington
D.C, March 24, 1989, a program for overseas training on road development,
traffic engineering, road safety and maintenance was reviewed and agreed.
But in the course of the procedures of submitting the negotiated
loan agreement draft to the state council, we were able to get the agree-
ment among related agencies to the project components except 'Training'.
As training cost was concerned, it should be, if possible, financed from
local resources which was our government's basic position.
After we had conference with the Bank on this matter, the category
and expenditure of trining was deleted in the Loan Agreement signed by
authorised representatives of the Republic of Korea and International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development November 15, 1989.
Therefore the implementation of the training program was not carried out.

D Project Implementation
1) Road construction and Improvement,
The improvement work carried out by MOC under the government's Nation-
al Roads project had been planned.
The Road Improvement project originally consisted of 21 construction
lots, all scheduled to be completed by December 1992. The number of lots
was incrersed to 22 as lot No. 4-1 (Iwon - Dokyung) was added in December
10, 1991 under same IBRD financed Project.
13 project lots were completed in December 1992 and the remained lots
were completed by august, 1993 due to the problem on right of way and
additional works by change orders.
The road improvement worked under this project consisted of upgrading,
widening and paving of 98.41kms of existing gravel road and 167.2kms of
existing two lane paved road.
The project lots are located in the provinces of Gyeonggi - Do (8),
Chungcheongnam - DO (3), Chungcheongbug - Do (1), Jeonranam - Do (4) and
Gangweon-Do(6).
The total 22 project lots were under the jurisdiction of Regional
construction office of the MOC of Seoul(8), Weonju (6), Daejeon (4)
and Iri(4).

2) Road Maintenance
Since 1987, BPR has done its condition survey of the national road
network as part of the implementation of the maintenance management
system, in order to identify priority road sections needing overlays
or pavement strengthening work.
Originally about 700Km of the pavement strengening program would be
executed during the period of this project, but the pavement strengen-
ing works were actually completed the total length of 695.8km between
1990 and 1993.

4) Road Safety Program
To enhance road safety, the Safety Manual for Design was published
in 1989 and has been distributed widely to potential users. The Standards
of Road Structure and Facilities was revised to strengthen the safety in
highway design in May, 1990.
Many hazadous locations were improved and major improvements were
as follows ;
(1) Intersection : new installation or location adjustment of traffic
signals, channelisation, installation of agd.ance signs,
adjustment of intersection angle etc.
(2) Pedestrian crosswalk : installation of traffic islands, traffic button,
signal in intersection, seperated crosswalk facilities etc.
(3) Improper road alignment : improvement of alignment, installations of
delineator, guardrail, road mirror etc.
(4) Installation of skid resistance facility and improvement of drainage
facilitis
The 1989 program where about 4,151 million Won from the Government's
own resources were expended on the 83 sites to provide needed improvements.
The 1990 program was formed of 36 high priority sites with an expenditure
of 5,000 million Won from the Government's own resources to provide impro-

vements. Another 118 loations were improved during 1991 at a cost of 6,260
million Won provided in the Government's budget. In 1992, 112 locations
were improved at a cost of 5,000 million Won provided in the Government's
budget.

projects by the Road Traffic Safety Association in 1992 showed that
the reduction rates of 31.2% in accidents, 27.4% in fatal and in injury,
and 3.0 of benefit/cost ratio was achieved.

LI Project Results
The project helped to increase transport capacity by supporting
three principal road - related Government objectives;
(a) enhancing transport efficiency by upgrading the surface and align-
ment of existing roads and by improving road maintenance and operations
(b) expanding traffic capacity by widening roads in corridors with high
transport demand
(c) increasing traffic safety through a number of measures incl.u,ding
safety - conscious design of project facilities, modification of
design standards and practices where appropriate and physical impro-
vement of hazadous road locations.
Overall, the project has been a success. While some of the policy
objectives have not yet been achieved because of a lack of consensus to
effect the necessary changes, the project made a substantial contribution
towards achieving the Government's goals for the improvement of the high
-Way sector.
The project brought about fundamental changes in the improvement of
road, road maintenance and the introduction of a road safety. From the
physical aspect, the project has more than achieved its objectives and
its results have had a noticeable impact in the intended areas. A signi-



- 20 -
ficant proportion of the national road networks improved, with a conse-
quent reduction in transport costs and improvement in maintenance capa-
bilty. Other aspects of the trasport sector will improve when the recom-
mendations of the various studies are fully implemented. The objectives
of the project did not changes during implementation in that they fully
supported the established goals of the highway investment program of
the government.
The project impacts includes;
(a) the development of a traffic safety program
(b) further strengthening of the construction industry through the expe-
rience gained by consultants in evaluation, design and supervision,
and by contractors in carrying out work to a strict specification.
