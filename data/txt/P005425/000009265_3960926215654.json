The\n            project has been structured as a sector program operation\n            that will cover four annual tranches of subprojects. The\n            project will have two major components: (a) renovation of\n            about 120 traditional irrigation schemes; and (b) equipment\n            of 7 spate irrigation repair brigades to operate in poverty\n            areas in selected Southern provinces. In addition, the\n            project will provide vehicles and equipment for central and\n            provincial staff, technical assistance and staff training,\n            and consultant services for the preparation of feasibility\n            and special studies."}, "docdt": "1988-05-16T00:00:00Z"}
