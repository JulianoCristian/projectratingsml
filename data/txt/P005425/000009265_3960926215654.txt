SECOND SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE IRRIGATION PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Bowwerov                 Kingdom of Morocco
Amount:                  US$23 million equivalent
retna:                   20 years, including 5 of grace, at the standard
variable rate of interest.
Project Desciption:      The proposed Project would finance a part of the
Government's public investment program in small and
medium scale irrigation during the 1988-1992 Plan.
The Project has been structured as a sector program
operation that would cover four annual tranches of
subprojects to be implemented over a five-year period
with disbursements over six years. The subprojects
included in the ;irst tranche have been fully
appraised; successive tranches would be prepared by
the Government following criteria and methodology
agreed with the Bank. The proposed Project would have
two major components: (a) renovation of about 120
traditional irrigation schemes covering approximately
32,000 ha, and (b) equipment of 7 spate irrigation
repair brigades to operate in poverty areas in
selected Southern provinces. In addition, the Project
would provide vehicles and equipment for central and
provincial staff of MARA, technical assistance and
staff training, and consultant services for the
preparation of feasibility and special studies. The
project would build up MARA's capability to select and
design development programs for small and medium scale
irrigation. The project would increase production of
foodcrops and livestock products in some of the
poorest parts of the country and would benefit
directly some 10,000 farm families many of whom live
below the rural poverty level. The risk of slower
project implementation and benefit accrual than
expected due to Government budgetary constraints
appears to be surmountable given the high priority
that the Government has attached to small and medium
scale irrigation development during the next decade.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
SECOND SMALL AND MEDTUM SCALE IRRIGATION PROJECT
L INTRODUCTON
1.01     The Government of Morocco introduced major changes in its irrigation
policy on the occasion of the 1981-85 Development Plan. While the emphasis
had previously been on continued expansion of large scale irrigation (LSI),
the new policy stressed: (a) measures to achieve improved use of water through
rehabilitation and more efficient operation and maintenance of existing
schemes; and (b) relatively higher investments in small and medium scale
irrigation (SMSI) works, given their lower unit cost, faster build up of
benefits and poverty alleviation impact.
1.02     In support of this policy of increased emphasis on small and medium
scale irrigation development, the Bank granted in 1983 a loan of $42 million
to finance a first SMSI project (Loan 2253 MOR). The project consisted of:
(a) the rehabilitation of three traditional perimeters covering 12,500 ha; (b)
the development of two new perimetesrs covering 5,300 ha; (c) complementary
infrastructure (road construction and power supply); (d) support services and
technical assistance for the Ministry of Agriculture at the central and
regional levels; and (e) on-farm investments financed through credit. Loan
2253-MOR was restructured in 1986 to take account of new investment priorities
stemming from the government's adjustment program. The restructuring involved
the cancellation of some new schemes and more emphasis on rehabilitation. The
loan amount was reduced to $34 to take account of these changes and currency
realignments.
1.03     Substantial progress has been made in the implementation of the first
SMSI project, in spite of persisting government budgetary constraints. By end
September 1987, some 32X of subproject funds were committed. The lateness in
government payment of contractors, however, has led to a considerable lag in
loan disbursements, which amounted to US$6.6 million at April 30, 1988, or 181
of appraisal estimates. The slow pace of loan uptake reflects both delayed
payments and the 40S fall in the value of the dirham since appraisal. The
project restructuring referred to above has resulted in government taking a
more selective approach to investment, and disbursements can now be expected
to pick up.
1.04     The proposed project is a follow-up operation on the SMSI project
described above, and it has been introduced with the purpose of covering a
wider geographical area with these investments. It is consistent with the new
investment strategy. It was identified by a Mission of the Bank/FAO
Cooperative Program (FAO/CP) in November, 1983. Preparation was done by the
"Service des Etudes G6nerales" (SEG) of the "Direction de l'Equipement Rural"
(DER) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform (NARA) with
assistance from the FAO/CP. The Project has been conceived as a five-year
3 333



- 2 -
subsector program operation. Four subprojects would be undertaken during the
first year, and these have been studied and analyzed in detail. Subprojects
for the following years of the project, however, would be subsequently
identified and prepared by the DER, in accordance with detailed guidelines
agreed between the Government and the Bank.
1.05     The Project was appraised in April/May 1987 by a mission consisting
of M. Ballesteros (leader), J. Cole (agriculturist), J. Chabloz (engineer,
FAO/CP), and E. P. Riexebos (economist, consultant).
II. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
A. Role of Amriculture in the Economy
2.01     Background.  Of Morocco's 60 million ha only 7.7 million are suitable
for agriculture, with another 20 million ha in semi-arid or mountain regions
suitable for grazing. Of the cultivable land, about 50% receives an erratic
rainfall of less than 400mm, and can only be put under a relatively high risk,
low value barley/fallow cropping system. The remaining 502, which benefits
from good, but sometimes erratic rainfall, can be cultivated with cereals,
forage and fruit crops. Out of an estimated irrigation potential of 1.3 M ha,
about 1.1 million ha are currently irrigated. Overall, the 7.7 M ha of arable
land produce mainly cereals (751), fruit (7%), pulses (92), olives and oil
seeds (51), vegetables (3%), and forages (12). Livestock includes 11.5 M
sheep, 4.2 M goats, 2.4 M cattle and 1.4 M draught animals. The rural
population in Morocco numbers around 11.7 M people or 571 of the total
population. The agricultural sector employs about 2.2 M people, most of whom
are illiterate (821). About 1.1 M small farms (less than 5 ha), which
represent 80% of the total number of farms, account for 251 of the cultivated
land, while 751 of the land is distributed amongst medium and large farms and
state farms. Individual ownership accounts for some 69% of total arable land;
5 of the land is government-owned, around 131 is collectively owned and the
remainder comes under various other systems.
2.02     Past Performance.  The performance of the agricultural sector has
been uneven. Following a period of expansion in the sixties, when agriculture
grew at more than 31 p.a. accounting for 251 of the total growth in GDP, the
rate of development of Moroccan agriculture has slowed considerably. During
the seventies and early eighties, the sector's average annual growth rate was
adversely affected by successive droughts and averaged only 1.21. Since 1985,
however, che return of more normal weather conditions has led to increased
growth. Currently, the agriculture sector accounts for about 171 of GDP and
provides about 40% of all employment compared with 28% of GDP and 551 of
employment in 1974.
2.03     Since the mid-seventies food production has failed to keep pace with
increased domestic demand generated by a combination of rapid population
growth (2.51 per year), a high rate of urbanization (4.81), and declining real
prices for food. Food imports have increased by about 101 p.a. and the
self-sufficiency rate for key items has declined (cereals from 86% to 601,
edible oils from 321 to 15%). Altogether, agricultural imports now account



- 3 -
for about 25% of the merchandise imports. The total value of agricultural
exports has been stagnant during the last fifteen years, and today, the
agricultural sector accounts for about a third of Morocco's merchandise
exports and 15% of total exports.
2.04     The Medium-Term Agricultural Sector Adiustment Program (MTASAP).
MTASAP was prepared by the Government in 1984 in response to the poor
performance of the sector. A five-year program started in 1985 with the
primary objectives of: (a) restructuring the public investment and expenditure
program in agriculture - the proposed project would be fully consistent with
this new investment orientation (para. 3.11); (b) correcting the prices and
incentives framework; (c) strengthening the agricultural support services
offered by the Government; (d) building up institutional capacity for
agricultural policy planning and analysis and strengthen the organization and
structure of the agricultural sector; and (e) helping resolve the basic issues
of improving productivity of land use and protecting the natural resource
base. The Bank is giving strong support to the above program through an
agricultural sector adjustment loan. A second sector adjustment loan was
approved by the Board in November 1987.
B. Experience with Past Lending Lathe Sector
2.05     The Bank has provided considerable support to Moroccan agriculture
and performance of Bank-financed projects has generally been satisfactory.
Bank projects have helped lay the basis for growth in the sector through
institutional reform and provide protectiou against drought through
irrigation. Bank group lending for agriculture began in 1965, and to date 10
projects have been completed and another 10 projects are underway. They
include seven irrigation projects: Sidi Slimane (FY65), Sebou I (FY70), Sousa
Groundwater (FY75), Doukkala I (FY76), Doukkala II (FY77), all completed, and
the Small and Medium Scale Irrigation Project (FY83) and Large Scale
Irrigation Improvement (1986). There have also been six agricultural credit
projects (of which one, FY86, is ongoing), an agro-industries and flood
control project (Sebou II, FY74 completed), five rainfed agricultural
development projects (Meknes FY75, completed, Fes-Karia-Tissa FY78, Loukkos
f1Y80, Middle Atlas FY82, and Oulmes Rommani FY83), an export-oriented
Vegetable and Marketing Project (FY79), a Forestry Project (FY82), and an
Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan (FY85).
2.06     Rural Development Projects.  In the rainfed subsector, the first
project (Meknes, Credit No. 555-MOR) experienced considerable delays in
implementation due to land redistribution problems, insufficient preparation
of project components, over-optimistic assessment of implementation targets,
and inexperience in the organization and management of rural development
projects. The Fes-Karia-Tissa Project (Loan No. 1602-MOR) was designed to
minimize organization and management problems encountered with Meknes, and the
implementation of both the productive and the social components are generally
satisfactory. After a good start, implementation of the Loukkos, Middle
Atlas, Oulmes Rommani, and Forestry Projects (Loan Nos. 1848, 2082, 2217, and
2110-MOR respectively) has slowed down as a result of the budgetary
constraints faced by the country. Due to these constraints and the fall in
the value of the dirham since appraisal, disbursements of Bank loans have been
slower than expected. The projects have been restructured to reduce budget
demands and a portion of the loans cancelled.



-4-
2.07     Credit Projects.    Performance of the five completed agricultural
credit projects has been good. Project Performance Audit Reports (PPAR)
stress the contribution made by the projects to the country's agricultural
development, their success in establishing an efficient credit institution and
the successful expansion of credit to small farmers. They also underline the
importance of improving agricultural price policy and extension and input
distribution for improved economic and financial performance of the credit
loans. These issues are being addressed through Bank sector work and through
the medium-term adjustment program supported by the ASAL (para. 2.04).
2.08     Irrigation Projects.  Performance of thte irrigation projects has been
good once initial problems of land distribution and organizational delays in
construction and procurement of irrigation equipment were overcome. The
progress of Loan 2253-MOR covering the first small and medium irrigation
project financed in 1983 is discussed below in para. 3.17. Of the earlier
projects, the PPAR for the Sebou I Project (Loan No. 643-MOR), completed in
1981, stresses the project's success in institution building and in providing
infrastructure to achieve production increases in irrigated crops. It also
highlights the need to complete land reform programs before the start of
irrigation works, the importance of successful extension work, timely
allocation of funds to O&M, and collection of water charges. The PPAR for the
Doukkala I Irrigation Project 'Loan No. 1201-MOR), completed in 1980,
indicates that the project was successfully concluded with actual production
and cropping intensity exceeding appraisal targets (ERR 20.5%). The Doukkala
II Project (Loan 1416-MOR) which was completed in 1986, is expected to achieve
a similar performance: OED is carrying out an impact assessment of the
project. The PPAR of the Souss Groundwater Project (Loan No. 1123-MOR)
stresses the successful land consolidation of private freehold land,
distribution of state and collectively-owned land and the establishment of
service cooperatives. It, however, highlights the neglect of regular
operation and maintenance caused by inadequate funding and lack of qualified
staff. This problem was subsequently addressed countrywide through the Large
Scale Irrigation Improvement Project (Loan 2656-MOR). The PPAR of the Sebou
II Project (Loan No. 1018-MOR) notes that as a result of the Project,
commercial sugar cane production and processing were successfully established
but emphasizes the vulnerability of investments aimed at the production of a
single, internationally-traded commodity like sugar which is subject to wide
price fluctuations, and also dependent on the successful development of
sensitive new crops like sugar cane.
2.09     The Agricultural Sector Ad3ustment Loan.  ASAL-I (para. 2.05) was
signed in July 1985 and is progressing well with timely action being taken by
the Government to implement the agreed-upon reform program. The second
tranche was released in September 1986 and the project closed on schedule in
June 1987.
IL. THE SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE IRRIGATION SUBSECTOR
A. Introduction
3.01     Of the 1.1 million hectares currently irrigated in Morocco, some 60S,
or 662,000 hectares, are in small and medium scale schemes and 40 in large
scale schemes. Small and medium scale irrigation schemes (SMSI) which include
perimeters of a few hectares under pump irrigation to several thousand



hectares irrigated by gravity, are distinguished from large scale schemes
(LSI) by three principal features. First, the majority of SMSI schemes are
traditional perimeters where irrigation has been practiced for many years so
that farmers are familiar with at least rudimentary irrigation techniques.
Second, the size of a SMSI scheme does not generally exceed two to three
thousand hectares while LSI schemes cover upwards of 10,000 hectares. Third,
the level of investment per hectare is much lower for SMSI schemes since major
civil works are not involved. Investment cost per hectare ranges from DH
5,000 to DH 10,000 (US$625 to $1,250) for upgrading of traditional SMSI
schemes to over DH 50,000 (US$6,250) for new LSI perimeters. Construction of
modern SMSI schemes, which often require large structures and complete
realignment of farm boundaries, approach the cost of LSI perimeters at DH
40,000 to 50,000 (US$5,000 to $6,250). Modern SMSI schemes make up about 5S
of the total area estimated to be under small and medium scale irrigation.
3.02     The development of Small and Medium Scale Irrigation is the
responsibility of the Service for Small and Medium Scale Irrigation (SPMH) in
the Rural Development Division (DAR) of the directorate for R'tral Engineering
(DER) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform (MAhA). SPMH is
responsible for the formulation of SMSI policy, the development of annual
investment programs, and the overseeing of project design. The Provincial
Directorates of Agriculture (DPA) and the Regional Offices for Agriculture
Development (ORMVA) are responsible for project construction and subsequent
operation/maintenance within their respective geographical area of
responsibility. The DPAs and ORMVAs are assisted by MARA's other technical
directorates, e.g., extension, crop production and livestock services for the
agricultural development of each scheme, with these services provided through
the local Extension Center (Centre de Travaux) or Agriculturai Development
Centers (Centre de Mise en Valeur).
3.03     While the major part of the investment budget in the agricultural
sector during the 1970s was in large scale irrigation (65% of total sector
investments and 90% of investment in irrigation), in the 1980s the Government
began placing increased emphasis on small and medium scale irrigation. The
share of total investments in irrigation going to SMSI (both rehabilitation
and new schemes), has increased from about 52 in 1975 to 10% in the 1981/85
five-year plan and 25% in the 1987 budget estimates. MARA's Directorate of
Rural Engineering (GiL.ction de l'Equipement Rural - DER) estimates that
between 1973 and 19&9 some 7,900 hectares of SMSI were renovated annually and
that between 1981 and 1985 this increased to 19,500 hectares annually made up

B. Water Sources. Potential and Exploitation to Date
3.05     A clear distinction should be drawn between the construction of
modern small and medium scale irrigation schemes and the rehabilitation of
traditional schemes which is the objective of the proposed project:
(a) Modern SMSI schemes include perimeters varying from 200 to 2 to 3,000
hectares which have been developed in rainfed zones where the absence
of traditional irrigation possibilities and low incomes make farmers
receptive to land consolidation.   .odern dams or diversion
structures, distribution networks and drainage works are built at a
cost in the order of DH 40,000 to DR 50,000 per hectare (US$5,000 to
$6,250). The perimeters are generally dominated by small farmers and
technically only differ from large scale schemes by their size.
(b) Traditional SMSI schemes are of variable size located in the valleys
and watersheds of the mountains and concentrated in zones of low
rainfall. Traditional irrigation techniques have been practiced for
many years with water from springs or surface water deviated with
simple structures and distributed through earth canals. Water is
distributed according to long-established rights. Cooperation among
water users has existed for generations through informal and
traditional associations created to oversee the distribution of water
and the organization of maintenance.
3.06     Three main types of traditional small and medium scale irrigation
have been identified according to the season and amount of water available:
(i) permanent irrigation possible throughout the year and particularly in
summer; (ii) seasonal irrigation primarily in winter; and (iii) spate
irrigation. Perennial sources of water include: (a) uncontrolled perennial
water courses with cropping along the banks with irrigation based on diversion
and resurgences; (b) perennial streams in the piedmont feeding perimeters by
gravity through canals and "seguias" (traditional earth canals); (c)
groundwater pumping through wel's or tubewells; and (d) oases in the Saharan
desert region with ancient systems of tapping groundwater through underground
tunnels ("Khetaras"). Intermittent sources include: (a) flood irrigation
based on occasional floodwaters of streams in semi-arid regions; and (b)
gravity diversion of run off from intermittent springs and water courses in
the more arid piedmont.
3.07     A recently completed (1986) inventory of traditional SMSI schemes
(total area 325,000 ha) in areas under the jurisdiction of the Provincial
Directorates of Agriculture (DPAs) shows 57% (187,000 ha) to be irrigated from
p3rennial sources, 23% (76,000 ha) from seasonal source and l9S (62,000) from
floodwaters. This area is distributed according to size of perimeters as
follows.

- 7 -
These figures include 28 all-spate irrigation perimeters totalling 33,000 ha,
and an additional 29,000 ha of mixed spate and seasonal irrigation.
3.08     The spate irrigation perimeters, which are located in the arid and
semi-arid zones in some of the poorest parts of the country and which are
estimated to have a potential area of 165,000 ha, have been the subject of
increased Government attention since the drought of 1980-83. Crop production
(primarily barley and durum wheat) in the perimeters depends on the
"spreading" with simple diversion structures of the two to five flash floods
received annually. The floods carry large amounts of solid material which can
cause serious damage to the structures and system of water spreading. A
system of regular clearing of material carried by the flood and replacement of
structures from time to time is required if families, who derive their
subsistence needs from these perimeters, are to continue to live in these
areas. The maintenance of these perimeters and restoration of diversion
structures has additional benefits in allowing a more effective infiltration
of flood waters and recharge of groundwater for use of livestock and human
population as well as for irrigation of small vegetable gardens. Accordingly,
with FAO assistance, two mobile repair and maintenance teams were funded in
1986 to work in Agadir, Taroudent, Tantan, and Guelmim. The progress and
impact of these two teams are being closely monitored and initial conclusions
are positive. These results have been taken into account in plans for funding
additional repair and maintenance teams under the proposed project (para.
4.04).
3.09     An inventory completed in 1988 for SMSI schemes under the control of
the Regional Agricultural Development Authorities (Offices R6gionaux de Mise
en Valeur Agricole - ORMVAs), shows some 179,000 ha to be suitable for
rehabilitation. The total area on which the rehabilitation program would be
based becomes:

Total    m             ul            HA
3.10     Agricultural Production in SMSI Perimeters.  In traditional
perimeters small (less than 5 ha) and medium (up to 10 ha) size farms
predominate and production is primarily winter cereals, particularly barley.
A variety of vegetables are produced for home consumption and the local market
except where farmers specialize in one crop (e.g., Guigou - potatoes). Olives
are the dominant tree crop, except in the Middle Atlas areas where fruit trees
and in the southern oases where date palms predominate. Barley and lucerne
are used as forage crops and irrigated forage is increasingly being
transformed for milk and for intensive meat production. The level of
technology is generally low in traditional perimeters, reflecting the
uncertain water supplies, with only limited use of improved seeds and
fertilizers. The improvement of irrigation practices and development of
extension methods is being tackled under the first SMSI project.



- 8 -
3.11     Rehabilitation of traditional schemes offers benefits through
increased crop production, more effective operation and maintenance as well as
positive social and environmental effects. Increased production follows from
the additional amounts of water available for irrigation and the more reliable
supply. With the risk of drought reduced, farmers are more ready to maximize
the area cultivated and adopt improved practices. More effective operation
and maintenance arrangements can be set up with increased farmer
participation. Social and environmental benefits follow from the reduced
out-migration as a result of increased food supply and farm incomes and
beneficial effects of development works (see para. 6.11).
C. Subsector Issues Relevant to the Project
3.12     Development of SMSI schemes may be adversely affected by a number of
factors centered on land ownership and water use patterns. However, these
issues are of more relevance in the design and implementation of new
irrigation schemes, where significant land consolidation and farmers' water
rights issues may seriously constrain development. Where, as in the proposed
project, the investment is undertaken to renovate and update existing
networks, without affecting current land ownership patterns or established
water rights, the likely constraint arising from those issues is decidedly
minor.
3.13     The proposed Project would further avoid any sizeable adverse effects
from those issues by the adherence to strict selection criteria in the choice
of subprojects (para. 5.06). There would be in the first place, the
requirement that beneficiaries establish a Water Users Association that would
assume responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the network. In
the unlikely event any reallocation of land or water rights among the farmers
were envisaged by Government, appropriate procedures exist under Moroccan law
to identify existing rights, carry out the reallocation and provide
compensation to those right holders affected by the reallocation. Secondly,
should major constraints prevail not amenable to solution by the intervention
of the association and the Government, the perimeter would be excluded from
consideration whenever such constraints lowered the expected rate of return
from the renovation works below the minimum required of 12%.
D. SMSI Development Pogragm
3.14     Irrigation Policy.  Government has provided considerable support for
the development of irrigation with more than 65% of agricultural investment
expenditure going for large scale irrigation during the seventies. Under the
1981-85 plan Government introduced substantial changes in its irrigation
development policy and reduced the share of investments to 532. After a
policy directed toward expansion into new areas objectives shifted to: (a)
improved use of water through rehabilitation of existing schemes and more
efficient operation and maintenance; (b) more emphasis on development of small
and medium scale schemes due to their lower costs per hectare and more rapid
build-up of benefits; (c) increasing recovery of operation/maintenance and
investments costs from farmers; (d) improving agricultural extension services
to promote more appropriate cropping patterns and irrigation practices; and
(e) limiting LSI investments to areas commanded by existing dams. The
adjustment program has been supported by the Sector Adjustment Loan



- 9 -
(Loan 2590-MOR) and by the Large Scale Irrigation Improvement Project
(Ln. 2656-MOR). The latter supports a series of measures to improve the
operation of the nine existing ORMVAs.
3.15     As part of its Sector Adjustment Program, Government is also adopting
criteria for the selection of small and medium scale irrigation projects to be
financed during the present plan period. These criteria which are to be
applied under the Second Sector Adjustment program include: an economic rate
of return which reflects the opportunity cost of capital, rehabilitation of
existing schemes, maximum implementation period, and existence of water user
associationa. The principle retained for the development of small and medium
scale perimeters selected according to the above criteria, is to realize a
program which will help meet the country's rapidly increasing food needs and
improve the level of the life of the rural population, primarily of those
living in the intermediate zones where rainfall is less than 400 mm.
Enterprises to be supported include vegetable, fruit and milk production.
Among the objectives is the rehabilitation of existing perimeters which have
already reached a certain threshold of production but which could produce much
more with some improvement of the irrigation works. The development of modern
perimeters for which the cost is relatively high will not generally be
continued.
3.16     Investment Program.  The increased emphasis on small and medium scale
irrigation is reflected in the 1986 and 1987 public expenditure programs with
the share of total investments in irrigation subsector rising from 111 in
1981/85 to 282 in 1988. Total investment in 1988 is budgeted at DU 209
million (US$36.2 million) of which DH 261 million (90%) would be implemented
by the DPAs and DH 29 million (102) by the ORMVAs.  Due to shortage of
Government funds settlement of completed contracts met only 201 of budgeted
expenditure in 1987, so that final investment levels will be much less than
budgeted. The investment program includes two major projects one (the Nekor
Project consisting of development of 5,000 ha of modern irrigation), funded
lOOX from Government sources and the other (Small and Medium Scale Irrigation
I Project) funded by Government and the World Bank.
3.17     The Small and Medium Scale Irrigation I Project covers rehabilitation
of 12,500 ha of traditional perimeters and development of 5,300 ha of modern
perimeters. Progress with the rehabilitation component is satisfactory.
Although the delays in budgetary appropriations, in contract approvals and in
payments of contractors have appreciably slowed down implementation, physical
construction has proceeded at a considerable pace. About 802 of all civil
works are already in place in the subprojects of Chichaoua (1,900 ha), Ghiss
(920 ha), and Jemaa Sahim (410 ha), and completion is expected by end-1988.
Orogress in the Souss subproject, which at 9,650 ha is also the largest, was
temporarily delayed by the need for further studies but work resumed in the
fall of 1987 and is proceeding satisfactorily. The development of modern
irrigation schemes in the Middle Sebou subproject, however, was cancelled in
October 1986 at Government's request.

3.18     The objective of the long term rehabilitation program would be to
rehabilitate about 250,000 ha of SMSI (that is about 652 of existing
traditional areas might justify rehabilitation) over 20 years. At about
12,500 ha a year this should be within the capability of available DER
capacity. This program costing in the order of DR 156 million ($19.5 million)
in 1987 Dhirams a year would form part of the core investment program to be
implemented under the ASAL II. The proposed project would finance a time
slice of this program.
IV. THIE PROJECT
A. Project Obiectives and Rationale for Bank Involvement
4.01     The central objective of the project is to pursue and strengthen the
systematic approach to the development of SMSI that was initiated with the
first project. The premise behind this objective is that Morocco has a major
potential for increasing agricultural diversification, yields, production and
income on lands that could aggregate to several hundred thousand hectares
through the rehabilitation of degraded SMSI systems. This potential is
distributed widely throughout the country and could help meet future food
deficits in many populous urban areas as well as improve the standard of
living of a substantial number of small subsistence farmers. Since the
majority of farm families on traditional small scale irrigation schemes live
below the rural poverty level (see para. 6.10), the proposed rehabilitation
project provides a good vehicle to tackle the poverty problem. The systematic
approach involves: (a) the creation of water user associations responsable for
operation and maintenance of networks and for cost recovery; and (b) the
building up of SMSI experience in MARA's central offices and regional
directorates.
4.02     The proposed project would be in line with the public investment
strategy adopted by the Government in 1985 (para. 2.04). It would
particularly further the goals of irrigation development policy described in
paras. 3.14-3.15 corcerning the upgrading of traditional small and medium
scale irrigation schemes that meet strict selection criteria. Finally, the
proposed project would greatly strengthen the Government agencies responsible
for SMSI development. Bank involvement in the proposed project would
significantly add to the support given to those programs and objectives under
its sector adjustment operations and it would, therefcre, be fully justified.
B. Summary De&cription
4.03.         The project would be designed and implemented as a sub-sector
program operation. It has been appraised on the basis of four feasibility
studies prepared by the local team of DER for 4 sub-projects totalling 7,800
ha, considered representative of the traditional irrigation sub-sector, and
the establishment of agreed criteria for subsequent project selection. The
fully appraised schemes would be rehabilitated during the first year of the
project. The remaining sub-projects would be selected, prepared and where
necessary appraised during project implementation.
4.04.         The two main project components would be the following:  (a)
renovation of about 120 traditional irrigation schemes totalling about 32,000
ha, of which nine would be spate irrigation schemes (8,000 ha) in the more



- ii -
under-developed semi-arid areas. The schemes would be selected throughout the
national territory, and would be under the jurisdiction of the DPAs or the
ORMVAs; and (b) earthmoving and related equipment for 7 spate irrigation
repair brigades in selected southern provinces.
4.05.         Other project components would include:  (a) 28 liaison vehicles
and office equipment for the Central Management Unit (DER) and the Provincial
Directorates (DPA); (b) technical assistance and staff training; (c) special
studies, reconnaissance and other preliminary activities, to be contracted out
to private consulting firms; (d) agronomic trials in flood irrigation
perimeters (para. 5.20); and (e) operating costs of the equipment and vehicles
provided by the project.
C. Detailed Features
1. Renovation Works
4.06     The renovation works would cover about 24,000 ha of perennial or
seasonal traditional schemes and about 8,000 ha of spate irrigation schemes.
The distribution of the number and of the size of the project schemes would be
expected to be representative of the overall sub-sector as follows:

- 12 -
4.07     The renovation program would be undertaken in four tranches of about
8,000 ha each. Tranche No.1 (7,800 ha, see Annex 3) would include the four
perimeters prepared by the project preparation team, namely: (i) Amizmiz,
3,250 ha of seasonal irrigation; (ii) Guigou, 3,000 ha of perennial
irrigation; (iii) Ait Messaoud, 1,500 ha of spate irrigation; and (iv) Agadir
Lahna, 50 ha of perennial irrigation. The detailed works are presented in
Working Paper No 1 of the Implementation Volume; and are summarized as follows:
(i) Amizmiz Sub-Project: Repair of the existing Sidi Hsaln weir and
intake structure (2 m3ts), construction of a diversion weir and a
new intake structure (1.5 m3/s) to serve the Larja and Assalda
traditional canals (seguias), renovation works of about 12.5 km of
existing damaged concrete canals including new outlets and dividing
structures, lining of about 21 km of main earth canals, with relating
command structures and improvement of 20 km of existing rural tracks;
(ii) Guigou Sub-Prolect: Construction of two diversion weirs on the
Guigou river and their intake structures, one weir equipped with a
desilting basin supplying three canals (Tamzilt, Taghzouanit and
Taouribelt), the other located about 2.6 km downstream serving the
N'Qob canal; and lining of 16.1 km of main earth canals with related
command and communication structures (intake, small bridges);
(iii) Nit Messaoud Sub-Project: Reconstruction of a spate diversion dam,
washed away by the 1985 heavy flood; the works would include a 105 m
long diversion weir (max. 2m above riverbed) made with gabions,
alongside a 95 m earthen fuseplug dyke designed to give way when the
river discharge exceeds 1,200 m3/s.  On the left bank a 20 m3/s
intake structure will be built to supply a main canal which will be
reshaped along 1 Km; and
(iv) Agadir Lahna Sub-Project: Lining of 1.8 km of earth canals with
related command and communication structures. The head discharge
would be around 30 l/s once the repair of the supply tunnel
(Khettara) has been completed.
4.08     Tranches No. 2 to 4 would each consist of about 38 perimeters
totalling 8,000 ha. The distribution of sub-projects 4n each tranche would be
expected to be roughly as follows:
-    24 small  perennial perimeters ( less than 100 ha ) :    960 ha
-    11 medium perennial perimeters ( 100  -  1000  ha ) : 3,000 ha
-     1 large  perennial perimeters (more than 1,000 ha) :  1,940 ha
Sub-total   : 5,900 ha
-     2 spate irrigation perimeters                        : 2,100 ha
Total:   38                                                       8,000 ha



- 13 -
Annual tranches would be of the same nature as those of the first tranche,
normally focussing on repair and/or improvement of the following
infrastructure: weirs, intake structures, basins, tubewells, Khettaras,
irrigation networks, mainly earth canals, bank protection structures, and
rural tracks.
4.09     The proportion of the various types of works has been established on
the basis of the overall experience in this sub-sector, and particularly that
gained in the first project (SMSI-I). For the perennial perimeters renovation
would focus on the improvement of the main canal network, while in the spate
irrigation perimeters the rehabilitation of the head diversion structures
would constitute the bulk of the works. The following percentages have been
applied to estimate the work distribution and corresponding cost of tranches
No. 2., 3 and 4:

2. Spate Irrigation Repair Brigades
4.10     The project would provide earthmoving and relateJd equipment for 7
provinces (5 in the South-Atlas and 2 in the North-Atlas region). This
component would be a follow-up to a pilot project being sponsorud by FAO since
October, 1986, consisting of two brigades operating in four provinces (para.
3.08). The equipment would be used for the maintenance and repairs of the
existing infrastructure for spate irrigation, mainly the desilting and
rehabilitation of head diversion structures and main canals. Two brigades
would be operated by the Tafilalet and Ouarzazate irrigation ORMVAs, which are
responsible for scattered spate irrigation schemes totalling about 24,000 ha
each, and five brigades would be operated by the DPAs of Marrakech, Safi,
Tiznit, Tata and Figuig, with command areas under spate irrigation schemes
totalling respectively 9,000, 7,000, 4,800, 4,000 and 6,000 ha.
4.11     Tentatively each brigade would include:  one wheel excavator (80 HP),
one back-hoe tractor (90 cv), one 7 t. truck, one compactor (30 HP), one
four-wheel drive vehicle, and various ancillary equipment such as workshop
tools, water and gasoil tanker, air compressor and welding set. In addition,
the brigades of the two ORMVAs would include an angledozer 125 HP
(Annex 4.1). The exact composition of each brigade would be adapted to
specific local conditions, and would take into account experience with the FAO
supported pilot project.

3. Vehicles and Equipment for Central and Regional Services
4.12     At the central level, the Project would provide 4 light vehicles and
4 four-wheel drive vehicles to be used by the SPMH of DER during the
preparation of the annual tranche and for the project monitoring (Annex 3.1).
Office equipment and canal gauging material would also be provided by the
Project (see Annex 3.2).
4.13     At the regional level the Project would iaterially increase the
volume of DPA activities, and in order to facilitate project progress a
maximum of 10 light liaison vehicles and 10 four-wheel drive vehicles would
be provided under the Project (Annex 3.1); they would be allocated to DPAs as
warranted by their work load.
4. Studies, Technical Assistance and Training
4.14     Studies  The SPMH would have responsibility for the preparation of
successive annual tranches, including feasibility studies, topographic
surveys, reconnaissance investigations, detailed designs and tender
documents. SPMH would be assisted in this preparation work by the ORMVAs and
the DPAs, and by private consulting firms. It has been assumed that about
half of the preparation activities would be subcontracted and, consequently,
an amount equivalent to about 100 man-months of consultancies has been
included in project costs. Funds would also be provided for trials on
agronomic practices in spate irrigation schemes (para. 5.22).
4.15     Technical Assistance  Specialized technical asistance could be
required to tackle selected problems such as water control and command, water
rights and structure foundations. Since it is not possible to identify
individual requirements at this point, a total of 10 man-months for short-term
specialized consultancies would be provided under the project.
4.16     Training  The project would provide 15 man-months of training
activities for DPA and DER staff dealing with SMSI activities. Technical
training programs would include study tours, participation in seminars and
training sessions in irrigation agencies (Annex 4). An amount equivalent to
the cost of three man-months of training per year has been included in project
costs.
D. Engineering Desgtn and Inplementation Schedule
Present Status of Engineering
4.17     Two types of design have been prepared by the local preparation team
for the four first tranche subprojects: (a) detailed designs with topographic
survey of longitudinal profiles for the irrigation canals to be rehabilitated;
and (b) preliminary designs of the diversion structures, without prior soil
investigations. For the Amizmiz subproject, prepared by the Marrakech DPA,
the tender documents have been completed. Ia the Agadir Lahna subproject the
works would be undertaken on force account and are already adequately designed.



- 15 -
4.18     Reconnaissance drillings and geotechnical investigations for the
Guigou and Ait Messaoud diversion weirs were completed prior to negotiations
and will form the basis for the detailed designs of the weirs to be prepared
by SPMH. Tendering for work on the first tranche is expected to start early
1989 and construction by June 1989.
Arrangements for Future designs
4.19     The methodology for the preparation of feasibility studies and
detailed designs of the perimeters to be rehabilitated under tranches 2 to 4
is explained below (paras 5.06 and foll.). About half of the volume of
studies and specialized investigations, particularly reconnaissance drillings
and geotechnical investigations, specific structures requiring complex
stability calculations, and comprehensive designs would be entrusted to local
contracting firms who are experienced in this type of work.
Implementation Schedule
4.20     The project would be implemented over a five-year period (1989 to
1993) in accordance with the annexed schedule (see Chart 2). Implementation
would be divided into 4 tranches of approximately 8,00 ha, each tranche to be
studied and executed over a period of 4 1/2 years as per the following
schedule:
-    preparation of tranches   :  Perimeter selection (tranches 2-4)
(27 months)                 Feasibility studies (tranches 2-4) and
Detailed designs
Geotechnical investigations.
-    bidding procedures        :  Preparation of bid documents
(6 months)                  Implementation studies (if necessary)
: Tendering activities.
-    physical implementation   :  The actual period of work would not
exceed
(6-18 months)               18 months.
Operation of the first renovated irrigation networks would start during the
spring of the 3rd year of the project; subsequently, in each successive year
up to 1994 some further 8,000 ha of renovated schemes would become operational.
4.21     The earthmoving equipment for the 7 spate irrigation repair brigades
is expected to be provided in year 1 for 5 DPAs (Marrakech, Safi, Tata, Tiznit
and Figuig) and in year 2 for the 2 ORMVAs (Ouarzazate and Errachidia). The
bulk of the 28 light and four-wheel drive vehicles for the DER and DPAs will
be delivered during the first two years of the project.

E. Cost Estimates
4.22     Total project costs, including taxes, duties and contingencies, are
estimated at DH 359 million (US$44.9 million), of which 35S, or US$15.8
million, would be in foreign exchange. Duties and taxes are assessed at DH
57.8 million (US$7.2 million), which is equivalent to 162 of total project
cost. Cost estimates are based on prices obtained during preparation in
December 1986, updated during appraisal to December 1987 prices.
4.23     The cost estimates of the four perimeters to be rehabilitated during
the project's first year are based on detailed designs of tie irrigation
networks and preliminary designs of the head diversion structures (see paras.
4.17 - 4.18). The cost of the three remaining tranches, comprising as yet
unidentified schemes, has been estimated using the per hectare unit costs of
the main categories of works, based on the designs of tranche No. 1 and taking
into account actual amounts spent for similar works in Chichaoua (SMSI-I
project). The following unit costs were thus calculated for the remaining
rehabilitation works:

4.24     Physical contingencies included in the cost estimates are 202 for
diversion dams, not yet studied at the stage of detailed designs; and 101 for
other civil works, equipment, and recurrent costs. It has been assumed that
physical contingencies for works to be started beyond year 2 (tranches 2, 3
and 4) are included in the proposed per hectare costs. Consequently,
separately listed physical contingencies amount to DH 8.9 million (US$1.1
million) only. Price escalation has been estimated following Bank guidelines
for local (8% per annum) and foreign costs (11 per annum 1988-1990 and 3.51
thereafter). Overall contingencies would amount to DR 49.6 million (US$6.2
million), or 16% of base costs.  Cost estimates are summarized in the
following table and shown in more detail in Working Paper No. 3 in the
Implementation Volume. A summary cost table by year is at Annex 5.

4.25     A loan of US$23 million equivalent to the Government of Morocco is
proposed, to finance 612 of total costs net of taxes. This would cover about
642 of foreign costs and 59% of local costs net of taxes and duties.
Government confirmed at negotiations that it also expects to obtain
co-financing totalling the equivalent of US$11.8 million, for 282 of the
foreign exchange cost and 34% of local costs. The Government would finane
the balance of US$2.9 million covering operating costs for heavy plant ant
equipment. Some 102 of the costs of civil works would be recouped by the
Government from beneficiaries through corresponding cost recovery charges
(para. 6.13). The following table summarizes the proposed financing plan:

4.26     Operation and maintenance of the irrigation networks would be carried
out by beneficiaries as directed by the Users Association. The corresponding
cost.  are not expected to be significantly higher than those currently
experienced by individual farmers, except perhaps in terms of labor, and have
not been considered as incremental to the project.

/a Figures in parenthesis are the respective amounts financed by the Bank.
4.28     Civil works.  Contracts for all civil works (120 subprojects),
including irrigation, drainage and road works and buildings, other than those
mentioned in para. 4.29 below, valued at a total of about US$34.2 million are
expected to be awarded through LCB procedures. These arrangements reflect the
experience in completed and on-going Bank-financed projects in Morocco that
only very large civil works (generally more than US$10 million each) can
attract foreign contractors who have no Moroccan office, due to the
competitiveness of local and foreign contractors established in Morocco and
the high mobilization costs for foreign contractors established outside
Morocco. The small size and the scattered nature of the Project civil works
throughout the country would not be of interest to foreign contractors.
Nevertheless, in the event that a contract costs the equivalent of US$1.5
million or more, International Competitive Bidding procedures would be
followed.
4.29     Experience also shows that where works are small and access difficult
local contractors may be unprepared to tender. In these cases works would be
carried out on force account by the corresponding DPA or ORMVA using existing
equipment. Force account would be limited to works costing no more than
US$55,000 equivalent each and aggregating not more than US$3.0 million.
4.30     Goods.  Contracts for the purchase of equipment and vehicles
estimated to cost a total of US$200,000 equivalent or more each (valued at a
total of US$3.0 million) would be awarded through international competitive
bidding (ICB), in accordance with Bank Guidelines. Qualifying domestic
manufacturers of equipment and vehicles would receive preference in bid
evaluation of 15% or the prevailing import duty, whichever is less. Contracts



- 20 -
for vehicles and equipment estimated to cost less than US$200,000 equivalent
each but not less than US$12,500 equivalent, and aggregating not more than
US$0.3 million could be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding
(LCB) in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank (para. 4.31).
Procurement of miscellaneous e-uipment costing less than US$12,500 equivalent
each and aggregating not more than US$0.2 million would be made in small lots
on the basis of local shopping with quotations from at least three suppliers.
4.31     Local competitive bidding procedures to be used under the project are
those generally used by the Government, with certain modifications to ensure
that they are consistent with the needs for efficiency and economy and are
acceptable to the Bank.  These modifications, which include public opening of
bids, have been agreed and are being applied in the Large Irrigation
Improvement Project. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that
procurement under the proposed project would be carried out under procedures
acceptable to the Bank.
4.32     Trainina, Studies and Technical Assistance.  Contracts for training,
studies and technical assistance totalling about US$1.3 million would be
awarded in accordance with Bank guidelines.
4.33     Review of Feasibility Studies, Bid Documents and Contracts.  Each
year, as part of project supervision, the Bank would review the proposed
annual investment program and would select a sample of projects for which the
feasibility studies would be subject to review prior to implementation
(para.5.07). The sample would be expected to include all the larger schemes,
i.e. those with an investment cost in excess of US$1 million each, of which 2
or 3 may be expected each year. In addition, a sample of the remaining
subprojects would be reviewed, selecting in particular those that might lend
themselves to alternative technical solutions. All bidding documents and
contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of US$300,000 or more each for
civil works and US$200,000 or more each for goods would require the Bank's
prior approval. Sample bidding documents to be used by DPAs and ORMVAs for
civil works have been agreed with Government. These arrangements would
represent prior review by the Bank of about 90% of the estimated value of
contracts for vehicles and equipment and 70% of the value of contracts for
civil works. The civil works program includes many small schemes (401 of
total value) which can not be readily subject to prior review. Random
checking of these smaller contracts would be carried out in the field by Bank
supervision missions.
H. Disbursement
4.34     Disbursement Schedule.  The proposed Bank loan of US$23 million would
be disbursed over six fiscal years starting in the first semester of FY89.
The disbursement profile for EMENA irrigation and drainage projects is 9 years
with about 85% being disbursed over 7 years. Bank loans for the four
completed irrigation projects in Morocco were disbursed in seven years. The
proposed project has been designed with highly conservative targets to permit
accelerated disbursement over a period of six years. This shorter period is
justified by: (a) the shorter implementation period, since the project would
cover four annual tranches of the SMSI program; and (b) spreading
implementation between a number of DPAs and ORMVAs. The expected schedule of
disbursements is given in Annex 6 and summarized below:
3333g

4.35     Disbursement Procedures.  The proposed allocation of loan proceeds
and the disbursement percentages are given below:

2.  Equipment & Vehicles               2.6        100% foreign expenditures,
100X of local expenditures
(ex-factory cost) and
65% local expenditures for

and Studies
4.  Unallocated                        2.5
4.36     The disbursement percentage for civil works is based on expected
co-financing arrangements providing parallel or joint financing of the civil
works program from 1990. The Bank would fund 80S of the first tranche and
subsequent tranches would be co-financed; if joint co-financing is arranged,
the disbursement percentage would be modif4ed accordingly.
4.37     Disbursements for the above items would be made after receipt by the
Bank of full documentation, except for the works done under force account and
under contracts of less than US$50,000 for both civil works and goods for
which disbursements would be made against statements of expenditures (SOEs)
certified by the executing agency involved. The agency would retain the
supporting documentation and make it available for inspection by Bank
supervision missions and by external auditors. The total amount of the loan
disbursed under SOE procedures would be not more than US$5.0 million.

4.38     Retroactive Financing of up to US$250,000 against payments made for
eligible expenditures before the date of the Loan Agreement but after May 15,
1987, is proposed to cover the costs of studies for the first and second
tranches.
4.39     Revolving Fund.  To improve the efficient and timely implementation
of the Project, the Borrower would establish a special account in Dirhams in
the Treasury (Ministry of Finance) to be used as a revolving fund to finance
eligible expenditures corresponding to the Bank's share of the four-month
average project needs. Its authorized allocation would be DH 12 million. The
special account would be replenished by applications submitted monthly, or
whenever one third of the authorized amount has been utilized, whichever comes
first. Applications for direct payments and for special commitments may be
submitted provided they are amounts equivalent to US$100,000. Government
counterpart funds would be secured in a timely manner through appropriate
budget allocations.
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Project Organztion
Principal Agencies Involved
5.01     The project would be implemented by existing agencies, principally
the Service for Small and Medium Scale Irrigation (SPMH) in the Rural
Development Division (DAR) of the Directorate for Rural Engineering (DER) of
the Ministry for Agriculture and Agrarian Reform (MARA). The project would be
under the overall responsibility of DEl with inter-agency coordination
effected through a Consultative Coordination Committee (CCC) already
established and operating under the first project. Much of the implementation
at the field level would be handled by the Provincial Directorates of
Agriculture (DPA), and also by the Regional Offices for Agriculture
Development (ORMVA) for SMSI schemes within their areas of responsibility.
5.02     Project Management.  The overall organization of the project, the
final selection of perimeters for the annual tranches (para. 4.08), the
preparation of sub-project feasibility studies and final design would be the
responsibility of the SPMH; see organization chart. A rural engineer with
qualifications and experience acceptable to the Government and the Bank has
been appointed to manage the project and would report to the head of SPMH.
The project manager would be able to call on the DER and DPA staff for
assistance as necessary. To the extent that existing staff could not meet
project needs private consulting engineers established in Morocco would be
used. The project manager would plan the project activities, coordinate the
participation of DER services, DPAs and ORMVAs and would follow-up project
financing with the Ministry of Finance. Staff of the Project Coordination and
Monitoring Unit (Cellule de Coordination et Suivi du Project - CCSP)
established in the SPMH under the first Bank project would assist the project
manager with the evaluation of sub-projects and monitoring progress of
implementation (para. 5.13).
5.03     DPAs/ORMVAs.  The provincial directorates of agriculture and the
regional offices for agricultural development would participate in initial
project selection and in carrying out feasibility studies. They would take
responsibility for implementation from launching bidding documents through
construction and subsequent work with Water User Associations on operation and
maintenance.

5.04     Consultative Coordinating Committee (CCC).  The Consultative
Coordinating Committee established under the first project, would be retained
to ensure the necessary inter-agency coordination. The committee is chaired
by the director, DER, and comprises the following: (a) the heads of DERs'
Rural Development, Large Scale Irrigation and General Studies divisions; (b)
representatives of Crop Production, Livestock and Extension directorates of
MARA; (c) the Director of Research and Water Resource Planning in the Ministry
of Equipment; (d) the Director of Budget, Ministry of Finance, or his
representative; (e) the Director of Local Communities in the Ministry of the
Interior, or his representative; (f) a representative of CNCA; and (g)
representatives of the concerned DPAs and ORMVAs. This committee would be
expected to meet annually to review progress and resolve problems of
inter-agencies coordination. Assurances that Government would maintain this
committee were obtained at negotiations.
B. Project hmplementation
Preparation of Annual Program
5.05     The preparation of the annual program would include the following
steps (see summary at Annex 7): (a) selection of perimeters to be
rehabilitated; (b) feasibility study including specific investigations and
preliminary studies where necessary; (c) evaluation of feasibility study; (d)
approval of annual program; and (e) preparation of detailed designs and
bidding documents.
5.06     Selection of Perimeters to be Rehabilitated.  DPAs and ORMVAs would
submit lists of perimeters for rehabilitation to the project manager who
would, in consultation with DAR staff, prepare an inital selection of
perimeters responding to the following criteria: (i) that at least 60% of the
farms be less than 10 ha for perimeters with a perennial supply of water and
20 hectares for perimeters to be irrigated by flood irrigation (spate) or
seasonal sources, and that these farms occupy more than 501 of the area to be
irrigated; (ii) economic rate of return expected to be at least 12S, or for
perimeters of less than 100 ha, that the rehabilitation cost not exceed DH
12,000/ha (US$1,500) in 1987 prices; (iii) works to be completed in two years;
(iv) that the beneficiaries have established a water usets association and
that the Government has made arrangements with the association to ensure
proper execution of works, operation and maintenance of the scheme, and
collection of agreed water charges; and (v) de;ign of the subproject in
accordance with appropriate health, safety and environmental standards
satisfactory to the Bank. Government's agreement to use these criteria in
selecting the investment program was obtained at negotiations.
5.07     Each year, the selection process would commence in January when the
project manager would meet with the DPAs and ORMVAs to discuss the basis of
sub-project selection and the lists of projects to be submitted to the head of
SPMH by end-March. The project manager would prepare a list of projects
together with an overall cost estimate and justification of the choice of
perimeters. Following approval by the director, DER, the final recommended
program would be sent to the World Bank by June 30 each year. The Bank would
select by end-July a sample of sub-projects for which it would request to see
the feasibility study and detailed designs. Work on preparing the second
tranche is underway. Work on the thi.d tranche program would start in 1989
3 3 3 3 E



- 24 -
and work on the fcurth trarzhe would be brought forward to late 1989. See
Implementation Chart 2.
5.08     Preparation of Feasibility Studies.  Preparation criteria are
summarized at Annex 8. Following these criteria, it is expected that some
eight schemes a year out of the estimated total of 38 to 40 would be
sufficiently large (over 1,000 ha) to warrant full scale feasibility studies.
The project manager in consultation with the concerned DPAs/ORMVAs would
prepare a program for the preparation of sub-projects to be undertaken by
DPAs/ORMVAs with the assistance of DAR and by consulting engineers as
required. Specialized assistance may be required for work such as: (a)
geotechnical investigations; (b) complex design of foundations; (c)
topographical studies; and (d) detailed design in severely deteriorated
perimeters. The feasibility studies will explicitly document: (i) the
willingness of area farmers to form Users Association, and (ii) the
implementation capacity of DPAs and ORMVAs involved to effectively carry out
or supervise the proposed works. Assurances were obtained at negotiations
that consultants financed under the project would have qualifications and
experience and terms of reference acceptable to the Bank.
5.09     Sub-ProJect Evaluation.  The feasibility studies will be reviewed and
evaluated by the Project Coordination and Monitoring Unit (CCSP), which would
verify that: (i) the sub-projects conform to the agreed selection criteria
(para. 5.06); and (ii) the proposed works are technically sound and
economically justified.
5.10     Finalization of Annual Program.  A final version of the annual
program based on the evaluated feasibility studies and taking into account any
Bank comments following its review would be prepared by the project manager
for approval by the DER Director prior to preparation of bidding documents.
5.11     Detailed Design and Preparation of Bidding Documents.  Detailed
design and the preparation of bidding documents will be handled by the DPAs
and ORMVAs with thn assistance of consulting engineers as necessary.
5.12     Execution of Proiect Works.  Renovation works will be carried out by
private contractors or in some cases DPAs/ORMVAs on force account (see para.
4.29). Execution of works carried out by contractors will be supervised by
the respective DPAs and ORMVAs. At each DPA there is at least a rural
engineer with two technical assistants; DAR would be able to provide
additional support if required.
ProJect Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting
5.13     The Project Coordination and Monitoring Unit (CCSP) would be
responsible for monitoring and evaluation of progress with the proposed second
project. This unit which comprises three engineers (1 GR and 2 TR), would be
strengthened with a civil engineer specialized in irrigation, an
agro-economist and a sociologist before loan effectiveness. Assurances to
this effect were obtained at negotiations. The main activities of the unit
would be to: (a) evaluate the feasibility studies for the sub-projects
according to agreed criteria; (b) provide guidelines, where needed, to DPAs
and ORMVAs for the preparation of economic and social justification of
projects; (c) monitor progress of project implementation, preparing
semi-annual reports on physical execution of works; and (d) monitor progress
3333Z



- 25 -
of all perimeters of 1,000 ha and above and on a 202 sample of those less than
1,000 hectares. This monitoring will cover progress with all phases of
project implementation and subsequent agro-economic development and will
include monitoring the development of Water User Associations. Monitoring and
evaluation indices are presented in ATnex 9.
5.14     Independently of the work of this unit, the monitoring and evaluation
unit of MARA's Directorate for Planning and Economic Affairs (DPAE) would
carry out on project completion a sample survey on the economic and social
impact of the project. Terms of reference for this survey will be reviewed by
DPAE and the Bank on the occasion of the first supervision mission.
5.15     The Moroccan Government and the Bank would carry out a progress
review of project implementation three years after the project's start. This
would provide an opportunity to review progress with the program approach and
institutional development and achievements of the Water Users Associations.
At least three months prior to the date of this review DER would prepare an
overall report on progress, issues and recommendations.
5.16     A project implementation schedule is shown at Chart No. 2.
C. Operation and Maintenance
5.17     Operation and maintenance of the renovated schemes would be the
responsibility of the Association of Irrigation Water Users that would be
established in every perimeter (para 5.06). A strong tradition of
organization exists among farmers in small and medium irrigation schemes which
will facilitate the setting up of such associations -
1/ A law has been prepared which, when promulgated, would provide an
automatic mechanism for establishment of such associations when Government
financed rehabilitation of SMSI schemes is envisaged (Law No. 2-84,
Relative aux Associations d'Usagers des Eaux Agricoles). The law was
approved by Parliament in 1986 and awaits the Royal Seal for
promulgation. The mechanism envisaged by the law parallels the approach
to be adopted under the Project. The main provisions of the law and
corresponding statutes are as follows: (a) the initiative to form an
association can be taken by the Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian
Reform (MARA), or by two thirds of the farmers in the command area of the
planned works; (b) membership is compulsory; (c) MARA may propose the
program of work, define its financial and technical contribution, and the
timing of execution and provide an estimate of financial charges of the
association for water use, proposed investments, and arrangements, for the
O&M of the irrigation infrastructure; (d) each member's charges are fixed
in proportion to his present rights within the command area; (e) the
program and charges proposed by MARA must be accepted by the constituent
assembly.

D. Suptr%ting Services
5.18     Extension and Research.  The agricultural and livestock development
divisions of the concerned DPAs' and ORMVAs' working through the respective
Work Center (CT) and Agricultural Development Center (CMV) would be
responsible for developing extension programs on the perimeters to be
rehabilitated (see organization chart). All perimeters to be rehabilitated
are covered by an existing CT, or sub-center, or CMV and staff at these
centers would provide advice, assist with credit applications and coordinate
input provision where necessary. Since 1985 MARA is reorganizing national
agricultural extension services along "Training and Visit" lines. A pilot
program for strengthening CTs was financed under the Middle Atlas Agricultural
Development P.oject (Loan 2082-MOR) and a more extensive Research and
Extension Project was appraised in June 1987.
5.19     Three specific technical aspects are being tackled under the first
SMSI project, namely: (i) improvement of on-farm irrigation practices; (ii)
the possible applicability of small-scale farm machinery and equipment; and
(iii) the development of effective extension themes and trainers for small
scale irrigation. DER's service for irrigation research is to design and
implement a program of technical assistance for the perimeters rehabilitated
under the first project from which data to improve yields over and above the
assumptions made for the proposed (second) project would become available in
due course. The study of the applicability of small scale machinery and
equipment, including the development of improved animal traction equipment, is
underway and would also be expected to provide additional benefits in due
course. A start has been made on the development of effective extension
themes and trainers for small scale irrigation.
5.20     One additional piece of research (field trials) - on flood irrigation
schemes - would be supported under the proposed project. Some 252 of the area
covered by the proposed project is in flood irrigation schemes for which
farmers in Morocco have considerable experience with traditional approaches
but for which little has been done to test improved practices. A first
attempt to monitor socio-economic results is being made under the FAO assisted
Mechanized Brigade Project and data should be available by mid-1988. As part
of the project DER would contract with a suitable research agency to initiate
in existing flood irrigation perimeters a field program covering appropriate
tillage practices and use of inputs.
5.21     Supply of Inputs and Agricultural Credit.  No serious problems are
foreseen either in the supply of inputs or agricultural credit required to
benefit from perimeter rehabilitation. Machinery hire services and inputs are
available increasingly through the private sector and where needs are not met
MARA's work centers provide services and inputs. Supply of improved seeds is
the least satisfactory and this is being addressed under Government's Sector
Adjustment Program supported under the Second Agricultural Sector Loan signed
in 1987. Agricultural credit (short and medium term) for SMSI is available
through CNCA which has been assisted by the Bank under a series of
agricultural credit projects (current project is the Sixth CNCA Loan,
Ln. 2367-MOR).
3333E

E. Accounts and Audit
5.22     The existing system of financial control and audit of governmental
bodies is satisfactory. Although ministries and other public institutions
have a substantial degree of autonomy in the physical implementation of their
program, the Ministry of Finance tightly controls their financial commitments,
transactions and accounts. Two officials of the Ministry of F'.nance are
responsible for overseeing, on a day-to-day basis, the fineancial operations
undertaken by a particular governmental department. A Financial Controller
reviews all proposed contracts and must countersign them before they take
effect. A Treasury Officer keeps records of all financial transactions after
checking them against predetermined programs and financial allocations, and
approves corresponding disbursements. The Financial controller and Treasury
Officer prepare monthly reports to be transmitted to the Central Services of
the Ministry of Finance. They also prepare year-end statements which are
transmitted, after review and approval, through the Minister of Finance to the
"Cour des Comptes". All government bodies are subjected to random inspections
by the Service of General Inspection of the Ministry of Finance, in particular
with respect to force account operations. Control of expenditures and of
their conformity to predetermined programs is thereby adequate.
5.23     Assurances were obtained at negotiations that: (i) the Government
would maintain accounts adequate to reflect the operations of the concerned
Government departments in respect of Project works; (ii) that these accounts
would be audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank; and (iii)
that an overall audit report for the Project would be prepared by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank and would be submitted to the Bank, along with
year-end certified summary accounts of all participating Government
departments, within 6 months of the end of each fiscal year.
VI. IMPACT. BENEFITS JUSTIICATION AND RISKS
A. Benefits and Beneficiaries
General
6.01     The principal quantifiable benefits of the proposed Project would
consist of increased output of a variety of crops and livestock products,
derived from the increased and more reliable availability of irrigation water,
and higher distribution and application efficiency. Other benefits would
arise from: (a) the savings in costs through the elimination of the need for
repeated major repairs of irrigation infrastructure; (b) the establishment of
users' associations responsible for operation and maintenance; (c) the
strengthening of the government agency in charge of the design and
construction of improvements and major repairs of traditional irrigation
works; (d) the slowing down of the rural exodus and the consequent saving of
3 3 3 3 E



- 28 -
private and public costs related to this migration; (e) a positive
environmental impact (i) in areas threatened by desertification, and (ii) in
areas where spate irrigation will recharge groundwater aquifers; and (f) the
lessening of sectoral poverty and income inequality by the fact that project
beneficiaries would belong (together with small farmers in rainfed areas) to
the poorest segments of the country's farming population. Benefits other than
incremental farm production, however, have not been quantified.
Production Increase
6.02     Sub-project areas would fall in either of three categories:  (a)
areas where water availability to date has been maintained at traditional
levels, and where the proposed Project would reduce water losses permitting an
expansion of the irrigated area. Examples are the sub-projects of Amizmiz
(Marrakech) and Guigou (Boulmane); (b) areas where water availability is
decreasing due to a gradual or sudden deterioration of the system, and where
the proposed Project would bring water availability and production above
original levels - an example would be the sub-project in Agadir Lahna (Tata);
and (c) areas where irrigation infrastructure has been damaged to such a
degree that virtually no irrigated crop production is taking place at present,
and where the proposed Project would restore water availability and production
to previous levels, and possibly above such levels. An example would be the
sub-project in Ait Messaoud (Guelmim). In the second case, with-project
production levels have been compared with present production rather than with
the progressively lower levels that would certainly result from the continuing
deterioration of the irrigation works. Estimated project benefits have,
therefore, been underestimated to some extent.
6.03     Crop and livestock production would increase as a result of the
greater water distribution efficency. Within the limits of water
availability, cropping patterns in the renovated traditional perimeters will
be determined by farm families' food needs and farmers perception of the
relative profitability of cash crops. Since most of the holdings are small
(less than 5 ha) and land resources outside the perimeters limited or
non-existent for the majority of farmers, cereal production, which covers more
than 50X of the cropped area in the four first year perimeters, is expected to
dominate the cropping. Nevertheless, the additional water available at the
field level would permit in some perimeters an intensification of existing
cropping (reduction/elimination of fallow and increased area in higher value
crops) as well as yield increases from more reliable water resource and
greater use of other inputs (inproved seed, fertilizers, etc.). In other
perimeters added water might permit an increase in the area cultivated.
6.04     The major crops in the four first year perimeters are cereals (wheat
and barley), potatoes, olives, dates and forage crops for milk and meat
production. Crop areas, yields and production in the without and with project
situation for each perimeter are shown in tables 1 and 2 of Annex 2. Crop
budgets are presented in the Implementation Volume, Working Paper No. 1. With
the project, crop yields would increasee by 30% to 100% according to crop and
the specific conditions of the perimeter (see Table 2, Annex 2). Crop yields
with and without the project compared with yields expected on large scale
perimeters are as follows:

The yield increases, which are conservative to take account of shortfalls in
hydrological data and lower degree of water control on SMSI perimeters,
reflect the increased water availability, higher seed rates and increased use
of fertilizer with the project.
6.05     Incremental crop production on the four first-year schemes expected
from the above yield increases (all perimeters except Ait Messaoud)
intensified cropping (Guigou) and expansion of area cropped (Alt MessaQud)
would be:

Milk production is well developed on the Amizmiz and Agadir Lahna perimeters
and the forage crops plus part of the cereals (barley) would be consumed by
milking cows. Subject to the provision on meeting family feed needs
(para. 6.03 above), a larger percentage of the output from subsequent tranches
of the investment program would be expected to be in the form of milk and meat
production.
3333X



- 30 -
Markets
6.06     Since projections of national supply and demand indicate a continued
deficit in most foods, the commodities mentioned can be readily absorbed by
the domestic market, most even on local or regional markets. Of the crops
produced under the Project cereals and milk have government regulated prices,
while prices for the other commodities are market determined. As additional
quantities are likely to be small, even at the regional level, farmgate prices
of the latter category of crops are unlikely to be depressed as a result of
the Project; the associated benefits are therefore expected to accrue mainly
to the producers, rather than to the consumers.
Foreign Exchange Savings
6.07     On the basis of present and future production levels, cropping
patterns and on-farm costs in the four sub-projects to be implemented in the
first Project year, the value of gross and net incremental production value to
be derived from the Project would be DR 80 million p.a. and DH 33 million
p.a., respectively.  Virtually all commodities likely to be produced under the
Project would substitute for imports, whereas inputs other than labor would
either be imported or have a large import component. On aggregate, the
Project would save foreign exchange by the excess of gross incremental output
value over imported inputs, for an estimated annual amount of about DH 45
million (US$5 million).

Beneficiaries and Farm Income
6.08     The proposed project would rehabilitate some 32,000 ha, benefitting
some 9,800 farm families, or 54,000 people. Beneficiaries include the women
who play an important role in farming in some parts of the country,
particularly the South. The project would further benefit the surrounding
population through upstream and downstream activities linked to project works
and subsequent farm production. Employment on project farms would increase by
about 600,000 man-days, equivalent to 2,400 full-time on-farm jobs. As
virtually all farms are owner-operated and are currently urderutilizing
available family labor, most additional employment would to a large extent be
family labor.

6.09     The financial costs and benefits of the Project to the farmers have
been quantified on the basis of land distribution, cropping patterns, and
information on production potential and current farming technologies. They
have been expressed in a number of farm models that are valid for the four
sub-projects of the first project year, presented in Annex 2, Table 3 and
summarized in the table below. Except for the oasis of Agadir Lahna, where
farms obtain reasonably high incomes relative to their small size, and where
incremental income/ha would also be high in comparison with the other three
sub-projects, incomes per ha for the other farm models currently range from
only DH 1,100 (largest model in Guigou) to DH 2,600 (smallest model in
Guigou); even after the substantial increases due to the proposed Project,
incomes/ha and total incomes remain low in comparison with those obtained in
the large modern schemes currently improved under the LSI Project.

6.10     These low incomes are also borne out by the analysis of the projects'
impact on rural poverty. The table below indicates that at present as many as
88X of project farmers are below the rural poverty level (defined as 302 of
national per capita GNP, i.e., 30S of DH 6,100 = DH 1,830 per capita or
10,000 DH/family/year); the Project would reduce this percentage by a mere
8 percentage points to 80S. That the Project would have a strong, albeit
insufficient, impact on poverty alleviation may be illustrated by the fact
that without the Project some 812 of farms in the four sub-projects are below
502 of the rural poverty level, while the Project would reduce this percentage
to 32X.

Environmental Effects
6.11     The project would have a positive impact on the environment in:  (a)
areas threatened by desertification; (b) areas where spate irrigation works
would help boost ground water recharge; and (c) areas subJect to flood
damage. First, rehabilitation of schemes in areas threatened by
desertification would help to stabilize cropping and take pressure off the
surrounding rainfed area (e.g., by producing additional liveatock feed to
reduce pressure on grazing). Second, the spate irrigation works would slow up
the flow of flood waters permitting greater infiltration and recharge of
groundwater. Third, the spate irrigation works and the work of the mechanixed
brigades would mitigate flood damage. Feasibility studies prepared for each
subproject in the annual program (para. 5.08) would include an environmental
impact assessment. Rehabilitation of perennial schemes is not expected to
create health hazards from schistosomiasis transmission. The disease
bilharzia is not a problem on the majority of small and medium irrigation
perimeters although it is found on some large scale schemes. A study of the
prevelance of bilharzia on larger scale schemes is being carried out under the
Large Scale Irrigation Improvement Project (Loan 2256) and the results are
expected to be available for review with the Government during 1988, before
finalizing bidding documents for the first tranche or launching environmental
impact assessments for the second tranche. Where problems do emerge the
Ministry of Public Health is well equipped to tackle these through a national
control program.
B. FinancialmpaCt
Cost Recovery
6.12     Recovery rules and rates under the present project will basically
parallel those retained for SMSI-I. Execution of that project has suffered
delays, and so has the implementation of the agreements reached at
negotiations as to cost recovery. These agreements can be summarized as
follows: not later than six months before the scheduled start-up of
irrigation in each of the traditional sub-project areas of the SMSI I Project,
MARA would i) propose specific cost recovery charges, expressed in actual
amounts, and ii) following a review of these charges with the Bank incorporate
them in agreements with the relevant water users' associations. These
33Sag



- 33 -
specific charges would be calculated in accordance with an agreed method that
ensures full payment of O&M costs, and a reasonable share of investments cost
(excluding taxes) at a level of about 352, with exemptions for small farmers.
6.13     MARA policy on cost recovery remains in line wich these principles,
i.e., that full O&M should be recovered and that investment cost recovery
policy in the renovated traditional perimeters should be made comparable to
that applicable in the modern perimeters, except for farm families with an
income below the poverty threshold (DH 10,000/year). With this exception,
this would mean that (a) farmers in renovated areas earning incomes lower than
the average income obtained from a 5 ha farm in modern irrigation perimeters
should only be charged 102 of the investment costs made on their behalf; and
(b) farmers earning higher incomes would pay additional amounts of up to 301
of investment costs.
6.14     With-project farm incomes in the 8 sub-projects of the modern schemes
in the Large Scale Irrigation Improvement Project range from DR 25,000 to DR
81,000 (at 1985 prices) when calculated on a 5 ha basis. The unweighted
average for the 15 farm models in these 8 modern schemes is DR 47,600;
adjusted to 1986 prices this is DH 52,250. The estimated with-project incomes
for the 9 farm models of the first tranche of the proposed project covering
traditional schemes range from DE 4,500 to DH 43,000 (1986 prices).
6.15     To illustrate the implications for the proposed project of recovery
1001 of O&M and 101 of investment cost, the pertinent data and the various
recovery rates for the different farm models in the first four sub-projects
have been presented in Annex 10. The impact of payments for O&M and
investment on farmers' incremental income, as expressed by the Incremental
Income Recovery Rate, would range from a low 52 in Agadir Lahna to 272 for the
largest farm model in Guigou, and the average for the first four sub-projects
would be 171. Project Rent Recovery Rates would range from 7l in Agadir Lahna
to as much as 591, with a four sub-project average of 28%. Some anomalies can
be observed: (a) the very low recovery rates for Agadir Lahna in relation to
projected incremental income and project rent; (b) the high and inequitable
rates for the smallest farm model in the Guigou sub-project; and (c) in
general for the 8 farm models presented, the absence of a significant relation
between incremental income and rent, and the level of the respective recovery
rates.
6.16     The conclusion to be drawn from the results of this illustrative
model is that, as already stated in the SAR of the SMSI-I Project, recovery
formulae should take into account the specific situation in each traditional
perimeter with regard to (i) projected farm incomes, incremental incomes and
rents; (ii) investment costs; and (iii) maintenance cost. In each case there
should be an attempt to reconcile adequate recovery of O&M and investment, and
income recovery that is equitable among as well as within individual
sub-projects. Proposals by the Moroccan authorities for the SMSI-I Project
were reviewed at negotiations and assurances obtained that in each sub-project
the principles to be adopted would include as a minimum full recovery of O&M
and 102 recovery of investment costs from the water user associations over 30
years (including 3 years grace) at 42 interest per annum.
Impact on Government Budget
6.17     Inflows to the Government budget from the proposed Project would
accrue from (a) loan disbursements; (b) import duties on equipment; and (c)
3,333



- 34 -
partial recovery of investment costs from project farmers. Outflows would be
(a) project costs; (b) debt service on the loans; and (c) operating costs and
replacement of the spate irrigation repair brigades. Outlays for operation
and maintenance of the irrigation network are to be fully met by the
beneficiaries, and are therefore not included in the table. Nor are savings
to the Government on account of some unquantified benefits mentioned above
(avoidance of the costs of major repairs and of public costs related to
migration) included as inflows.
6.18     As shown in Annex 11 and summarized below, the government cash flow
will remain negative after the investment phase. This is due to the fact that
(a) investment costs are to be only partially recovered and (b) costs of the
spate irrigation repair brigades are to be borne by the Government. The
negative cash flow is justified by the fact that the vast majority of project
beneficiaries belongs to the country's lowest income groups (para. 6.10).

C. Economic AnaYis
Prolect Life and Construction Period
6.19     With adequate maintenance the overall life of the infrastructure to
be rehabilitated or installed can be conservatively estimated at 30 years.
Maintenance equipment to be purchased under the Project can be expected to
have an economic life of 15 years and vehicles and minor equipment 5 years.
Works in sub-projects will be carried out in a maximum of 18 months and the
maximum implementation time of the Project would be 5 years (with a maximum
disbursement period of 6 years).
Benefit Build-up Period
6.20     Benefits may be expected to reach full development within two years
after completion of work. Such a rapid build-up of benefits is justified (a)
by the fact that farmers in all sub-projects have a long tradition of
irrigated farming and will immediately seize their expanded possibilities; and
(b) because yield projections are based on existing technologies, and are
exclusive of any long-maturing improvements that might arise from additional
research and extension efforts.

Economic Prices
6.21     Economic prices have been calculated for project inputs and outputs
for use in the economic analysis. On the basis of the commodity price
projections made at the Bank (Report No. 814/86), with adjustments for freight
an handling costs, import parity prices for traded commodities have been
calculated. The results show that only in the case of bread wheat are there
differences between the import parity price and the financial price at
farmgate, and these are minor: according to locality and projection year, the
economic price of bread wheat is between 52 higher and 101 lower than the
financial price. Consequently, economic prices have been considered equal to
farmgate prices for all project output.
6.22     The opportunity cost of farm labor has been estimated at 20 DR/day,
which is 80% of the current average wage, while economic prices for some other
inputs are substantially higher than financial prices: for urea and TSP 40X,
for seed of bread wheat and barley 1101. Due to taxes and labor component,
the economic cost of civil works is 151 below financial cost, whereas for
equipment a reduction of 5% was applied. Annex 12 presents details on
financial and economic prices used.
6.23     The weighted average of the internal economic rates of the return
(IERRs) of the four sub-projects of the first Project tranche gives an
estimated overall IERR of 20%. The EERRs of the four sub-projects are as
follows:

D. Risks and Sbnsitivity Analysis
Risks
6.24     Two principal risks have been identified in the Project, but none
appears severe enough to jeopardize the economic viability of the Project.
6.25     Budgetary.  Continued budgetary problems could prevent the Government
from adequately funding its share of Project cost in the course of execution;
this could lead to construction periods for individual sub-projects beyond the
envisaged maximum of 18 months, thereby reducing the IERR of these
sub-projects. The Government's expressed policy of emphasizing small- and
la1 w



- 36 -
medium-scale irrigation investment under the current Medium-Term Adjustment
Program and the provisions of ASAL-2 makes the availability of adequate
funding relatively more assured; as does the availability of cofinancing.
6.26     Institutional.  As small and medium size irrigation works have, until
recently, received a secondary attention in Morocco's irrigation policy, the
institutions in charge of such works are relatively small and untested. This
could possibly lead to delays in Project execution, in particular in the
design phase. This risk will be considerably reduced by (a) the appointment
of a project manager and additional staff to the DAR (paras. 5.02 and 5.13);
(b) commissioning out the preparation of some of the sub-projects still to be
selected to private engineering firms (para. 5.08); and (c) the Bank's review
of selected feasibility studies prior to execution (para. 5.07).
Sensitivity Analysis
6.27     Allowance for the risks described above as well as for others of a
general nature such as unusually adverse weather, has been considered for the
sensitivity analysis as follows: (a) implementation time of all sub-projects
has been assumed to be on average 36 months (of which 24 months actual
construction) instead of the envisaged 18 months (of which an average of
12 months actual construction time); (b) average production benefits have been
assumed to fall short by 202; and (c) the expected life span of the Project
has been halved, to 15 years. The table below shows the results of the
sensitivity analysis for the four sub-projects of the first Project tranche,
and estimated for the entire Project, in terms of IERRs. The customary
switching values are also shown.
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Sub-Project   Base IERR      Delayed        Lower       Shorter       Switching Values
Implementation   Benefits  Project Life    Benefits   Costs
Amizmiz            24             20           16            20           -33      +50
Guigou             22             17           14            17           -26      +34
Ait Messaoud       12             10            8             7            -6       +5
Agadir Lahna       46             38           36            45           -70     +237
Total four
sub-projects      20             16           13            15.5        -24       +31
6.28     Since project benefits have been calculated on the basis of extremely
conservative assumptions, the likelihood of actual shortfalls of the magnitude
assumed in the sensitivity analysis (20%) is considered remote. The figures
emphasize, on the other hand, the importance of timely implementation and, in
particular, of adequate maintenance to reduce to a minimum the risk of shorter
project life.

VII SUMMARY OF AGREE   TO BE REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01     Assurances were obtained at negotiations that:
(a) local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to the Bank would be
applied under the proposed project (para. 4.31);
(b) the Project Consultative Coordinating Committee and the Project
Coordination and Monitoring Unit would be maintained (para. 5.04 and
5.13);
(c) selection of future subprojects would be made on the basis of agreed
criteria (para. 5.06);
(d) consultants financed under the project would have qualifications,
experience and terms of reference acceptable to the Bank (para. 5.08);
(e) specific provisions would be followed concerning accounts and audit
pertaining to Government departments and agencies participating in
the project (para. 5.23).
7.02     As a condition of effectiveness of the proposed Loan, the Government
would strengthen the Project Coordination and Monitoring Unit (CCSP) as agreed
(para. 5.13).
7.03     Subject to the above assurances and conditions, the Project is
suitable for a Bank loan of US$23 million equivalent with a term of 20 years,
including a grace period of five years. The Project is expected to be
completed by December 31, 1993.

SECOND SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE IRRIGATION PROJECT
Criteria for Sibproiect Selection and Preparation
A. Selection Criteria
1.       The detailed inventory of Small and Medium Scale Irrigation (SMSI)
Perimeters prepared by the Directorate for Rural Equipment in the DPA's and
ORMVAs' jurisdiction will form the basis for selection of each year's program.
2.       Only those perimeters meeting the following criteria will be selected:
(i) that at least 60% of the farms be less than 10 ha for perimeters with
a perennial supply of water and 20 ha for perimeters to be irrigated
by flood irrigation or seasonal sources, and that these farms occupy
more than 50% of the area to be irrigated;
(ii) where the soil quality would not limit the benefits from irrigation;
(iii) where the internal economic rate of return (ERR) is more than 122 -
the ERR would be calculated for all subprojects, except those for
which the size is less than 100 ha and    the cost per hectare not
more than US$1500/ha (in 1987 prices) DH 12,000/ha;
(iv) where the infrastructure for mobilizing and transporting water is in
need of priority rehabilitation;
(v) for which the rehabilitation works can be completed in a maximum of
two years; and
(vi) where the owners of water rights are prepared to create a Water Users
Association (AUEA) which will take responsibility for the management
and operating of communal works and where the administrators'
proposals have been approved by the AUEA's general assembly.
B. Preparation Criteria
3.       The perimeters are classified according to four categories related to
area commanded by the works to be renovated:
(a) perimeters with perennial or semi-perennial irrigation of less than
100 ha; (b) perimeters with perennial or semi-perennial irrigation
of 100 to 1,000 ha; (c) perimeters with periennial or semi-perennial
irrigation of more than 1,000 ha; and (d) perimeters with flood
irrigation.

methods to estimate average annual and monthly discharges; (v) Estimation of
the actual efficiency of the irrigation works including head works and
distribution network as a basis for determining the additional additional
volume of water available following rehabilitation (to be estimated based on
data collected under para 7 below - perimeters of over 1,000 ha); (vi)
Agro-economic study to estimate production with and without project and
covering crop area, yield, production, costs and returns per ha and per
perimeter, use of inputs, input and crop prices; (vii) Land holding structure
- number and distribution by size; and (viii) Supporting services available
with details of staffing, equipment, etc.
7.       Perimeters of more than 1,000 ha with perennial or semi-perennial
irrigation:   i Location plan at scale of 1:50,000 ha or 1:25,000; (ii)
Description of irrigation infrastructure including network, hydrological
characteristics and management system; (iii) Soil description covering
possible constraints (drainage and security) as well as suitability for

(2) Project Description
9.       This will cover detailed description of the proposed irrigation
infrastructure, including implementation timetable, and cost estimates.
10.      Irrigation Infrastructure.  The additional water will be distributed
after rehabilitation according to existing water rights (para. 13). The
overall increase in irrigation efficiency from the rehabilitated perimeters
should be not less than 50% (except for flood irrigation perimeters). The
renovation of irrigation structure should comprise:
(a) For all perennial and semi-perennial perimeters: improvement or
reconstruction of permanent derivation structures; repair of lined
primary canals; lining of secondary canals; equipping the main
network with regulation structures; construction or renovation of
drainage infrastructure; deepening or renovation of surface wells;
repair of roads; and various protection structures. The project
documents will include: (i) location plan at 1:50,000 ha of the
irrigation network; (ii) horizontal and vertical cross-section of
canals; (iii) cross-sectional plans at 1:200 of main structures; (iv)
results of geotechnical studies; (v) calculations Justifying size of
works proposed; and (vi) quantities and unit costs of works to be
undertaken.
(b) For the flood irrigation perimeters: improvement or reconstruction
of derivation works; renovation of primary distribution network; and
repair of access tracks and drainage structures. The project
documents will include: (i) location plan at 1:5,000 or scale of
existing plan; (ii) cross-sections of main structures at 1:200; (iii)
horizontal and vertical cross-sections of primary canal; (iv) results
of geotechnical studies on foundations; (v) calculations justifying
size of works proposed; (vi) quantities and unit costs of works to be
undertaken.
11.      Cost Estimates.  Cost estimates for different works will be based on
unit costs from recent contracts let by DER and should include physical
contingencies at 10X.
(3) Economic Evaluation
12.      The objective is to demonstrate the economic viability of the
subproject and should include an estimate of the incremental production due to
the project and the economic rate of return. The data to be presented will
depend upon the size of perimeters as follows:
(a) Perimeters of less than 100 ha. For these perimeters it will be
sufficient to calculate the average rehabilitation costs per ha and
compare this with the maximum average cost established in the
selection criteria [US$1500/ha (in 1987 prices) - DH 12,000/ha]. All
sub-projects which are at or below this threshold will be considered
as having an acceptable rate of return. For the subprojects above
this level procedures as in (b) below will be followed;

(b) Perimeters of more than 100 ha. The proposed agricultural
development program should include the expected; cropping pattern of
the perimeter; the crop yields, total production and gross value;
input and labor needs, crop budgets. Cost and benefit streams should
be calculated on the basis of a two year implementation program and
project life of 20 years and Economic Rate of Return calculated.
Cost streams should include investment and operating/maintenance
costs.
(4) Operation and Maintenance of Perimeters
13.      Operation and maintenance provisions should be presented including
steps taken to set up the Water Users Association and the status of the
association. The study would include: (i) a detailed study of the current
status of water distribution; and (ii) a discussion on whether and if so, how
these rules would be modified by the project.
(5) Impact on the Environment
14.      An environmental impact assessment should be made to determine any
possible negative environmental effects from the proposed sub-project
rehabilitation. The assessment should cover, in general, the possible longer
term impact of the rehabilitated scheme on the physical and human environment,
and, in particular, should examine possible negative effects from increased
incidence of disease (e.g., shistosomiasis), water logging, salinity,
destruction of fauna habitat and pesticide runoff. The results of the
assessment should be taken into account in design studies so as to minimize
any expected negative environmental impact.
