REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO TRE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
TllE INVESTMENT BANK OF ROMANIA, WITH THE
GUARANTEE OF THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF ROMANIA, FOR
THE RIUL MARE-RETEZAT HYDROPOWER PROJECT
J.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Investment Bank of Romania, with the guarantee of the Socialist Republic
of Romania, for the equivalent of US$50 million, to help finance the foreign
exchange cost of a hydropower project. The loan would have a term of 20
years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at 8-1/2 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic memorandum for Romania (818a-RO), was distributed
to the Executive Directors on December 29, 1975. Country social and economic
data are given in Annex I.
3.        Since the founding in 1947 of the People's Republic of Romania,
which in 1965 was reconstituted as the Socialist Republic of Romania, economic
management has been organized along socialist principles which have included
state and cooperative oamership of almost all productive resources, and the
absence of private enterprise. Economic activity is directed by means of
obligatory development planning, coordinated by the central authorities.
Productive enterprises operate within the framework of the development plan
which defines the scope of their activity, the outlines of their production
and investment goals and their targets for operating efficiency. The Plan
is elaborated within a five-year time frame, each year having a separate Annual
Plan. The country has just begun its Five-Year Plan for 1976-80.
4.        The technical and functional Ministries are the State's chief agents
for the administration of economic activity. They are assisted by subordinate
units known as Centrals, which coordinate and supervise activities within a
common branch or industry without being directly engaged in production. Enter-
prises subordinate to the Centrals are responsible for production which is
controlled through a system of physical production targets. Production enter-
prises generally are not authorized to engage directly in foreign trade and
rely on specialized foreign trade enterprises for this purpose. In agri-
culture, large State farms and cooperatives are the predominant units of
production.
5.        Economic development is of paramount concern to the Romanian
Government. Rapid indust:rialization is a major objective with priority being
given to heavy industry including steel, machine tools and chemicals. To

achieve their growth objectives, the Romanian authorities have made consider-
able efforts to mobilize domestic resources for development and to maintain
a high rate of capital formation. In the last Five-Year Plan, planned and
actual investment rates of around 30 percent of GNP were the norm. As a con-
sequence, consumption has been restrained, and the development of the consumer
goods industry has been less strongly emphazised than that of heavy industry.
In 1974, heavy industry (led by machine tools, chemicals and ferrous metal-
lurgy) accounted for about 58 percent of industrial production.
6.        As a result of this strategy, a marked change has been achieved in
the structure of Romania's economy. Rapid industrial growth, which over the
last decade has averaged more than 13 percent per annum, has expanded the
share of the labor force employed in industry (including power and construc-
tion) from about 14 percent in 1950 to 38 percent in 1974. During the same
period, the share of labor force engaged in agriculture declined from 74 per-
cent to around 40 percent; and while agricultural output almost tripled, its
share in GNP amounted to only 16 percent in 1974.
7.        Notwithstanding the emphasis on industrialization, more than half
of the population (about 57 percent in 1974) still lives in rural areas and
agriculture remains a key sector of the economy. Apart from supplying food,
industrial inputs and the residual labor increment-for industrial growth (which
requires an expansion in agricultural productivity), the sector also supplies
about 27 percent of the nation's convertible foreign exchange earnings.
These earnings, which are largely used to buy imported inputs for industry,
have often been jeopardized as a result of unstable production growth in agri-
culture. The maintenance of the industrial development program, therefore, is
dependent on the performance of the agricultural sector.
8.        Romania's population growth is around 1.0 percent per annum. Thus,
the impact of rapid economic growth on per capita incomes has been only mar-
ginally diluted by the population increase. In the last decade, GNP growth
has averaged 9.0 percent per annum, implying a growth of about 8.0 percent per
annum of per capita GNP. A preliminary estimate for GNP per capita in 1974
is US$910 (as presented in the 1975 World Bank Atlas).
9.        The organization of production in both the urban sector and in agri-
culture is such that all labor is employed and there is no open unemployment.
There is, however, some labor surplus, mainly in agriculture. Income distri-
bution is also relatively equal. In 1974, average monthly wages were 1,663
lei (over $80 equivalent) per month, up 6.4 percent over the previous year.
Almost 80 percent of all monthly wages in 1972 were within the range of 900-
2,000 lei and less than 6 percent were under 900 lei. Prices for essential
consumer goods and services such as basic foodstuffs, rents and urban trans-
port are relatively low and most social services, notably education and health
care, are provided without charge. Continuous efforts are made to increase
the standard of living. Romania also pursues a positive regional policy
which has sought to bring a balanced development of both human and natural
resources to all parts of the country.



10.       The official exchange rate of lei 4.97 per US51 is used only for
accounting purposes. The rate used for tourist transactions is lei 12 per
US$1, having been revalued from a rate of lei 14.38 per US81 in October 1974.
Under a new system introduced in January 1974, the Prices of all traded goods
are converted at a uniform rate of lei 20 per US$1, a rate which is considered
by the Romanians as being representative of the cost of convertible foreign
exchange. For imported goods, the domestic lei price is found by adding to
the foreign price converted at the new rate a tariff rate which varies for
different types of goods. The rate of lei 20 per USS1 has also been used to
convert national income statistics from lei to dollars. Consequently, this
rate has been used as the base rate for calculations in the appraisal.
Recent Developments
11.       Since the National Party Conference of 1967, which set the stage
for major qualitative advances in Romania's economic and social development,
there have been important new emphases in Romania's economic management.
Measures were taken to Lmprove the institutional basis of planning (e.g. by
creating the Centrals to assist in plan administration), to increase the ef-
ficiency of economic management and to improve upon the quality of production
in industry. In agricu]lture efforts were made to raise productivity and
stabilize growth through irrigation, mechanization and the expanded use of
chemical fertilizers. lo promote the growth of foreign trade and tech-
nical-economic cooperation the Romanian Government has concluded trade and
cooperation agreements with a wide range of countries. In this context also,
Romania has made positive efforts to expand its multilateral external rela-
tions and to pursue full cooperation with the international agencies, includ-
ing UN, UNCTAD, UNESCO, FAO, UNIDO and GATT.
12.       Measures aimed at continued improvement of the management system
include a reorganization (involving a reduction from 217 to 95) in the number
of industrial Centrals and a concentration of their planning, control and
research functions. The pursuit of purely physical goals in production and
trade, while still an important element in the system, is being supplemented
by much greater emphasis on productive and investment efficiency, product
quality, pricing and foreign competitiveness. To eliminate wasteful invest-
ment and production expenditures, a Superior Court of Financial Control has
been instituted, among ot:her things, to oversee a new system of financial
control.
13.       Foreign trade has expanded quite rapidly in recent years both in
volume and in regional di'versity. There has also been a tendency to move away
from trade on a bilateral. barter basis toward trade involving multilateral
payments. During the period 1971-74, total foreign trade grew at about 34
percent per annum in current prices. As a result of both rapid world price
increases and expanded vwlume of trade, the total value of trade grew by 38
percent in 1974, with exports growing by 32 percent to US$4.9 billion, and
imports increasing by about 47 percent to US$5.1 billion. About 59 percent
of 1974 trade was with non-socialist countries as against 50 percent in the



- 4 -
previous year, a trend largely explained by the more rapid price increases in
non-socialist trade. Overall trade deficits have generally remained small,
but in 1974 there was an overall trade deficit of $191 million, while the
deficit with the convertible area was over $300 million. In recent years
imports from East European Socialist countries have been slightly lower than
Romania's exports to that region. In Romania's trade with Western industria-
lized countries, on the other hand, exports typically have been much less
than imports. These deficits have sometimes been increased by deficits on
the invisibles account with Western countries.
14.       The structure of Romania's trade with the developed market econo-
mies remains essentially unfavorable. Raw materials and agricultural commo-
dities, both of which are subject to unstable price and production conditions,
comprise about 60 percent of total exports to these countries. At the same
time imports from these countries are largely of machines and equipment and
other manufactured goods. Because of the present low level of reserves, any
instability in export performance, as frequently arises from shortfalls in agri-
culture (paragraph 7 above), tends to place the import program in immediate
jeopardy, and shortages of convertible currencies would persist even if
Romania were to have recurring overall trade surpluses.
15.       During July 1975, serious floods caused extensive economic and other
damage in Romania with losses to agriculture, transport and national industrial
enterprises estimated at about US$800 million. The floods also damaged about
250 local industrial enterprises, housing, and community facilities in 1,300
villages and 65 towns which were flooded.    It will take at least one or two
years to complete rehabilitation of flood damage and several years for the
economy to recover fully.
External Assistance
16.       The expansion of Romania's imports from the non-socialist industrial
countries has led to an increased need to obtain convertible currencies to pay
for imports from those countries. Romania has met this need both by borrowing
abroad and by mounting a major effort to expand exports and tourism. Gross
inflows of convertible currency through medium- and long-term loans were
US$1,055 million in 1974, consisting mostly of financial and suppliers' credits
with relatively short repayment periods. This represented a net inflow of
some $643 million after accounting for the country's repayment obligations.
17.       As part of its effort to expand its foreign trade and cooperation
relationships, Romania has also taken active steps to attract long-term pri-
vate capital. A regulation passed in 1972 defines the conditions under which
foreign firms can establish joint ventures with domestic enterprises, prefer-
ably in foreign exchange earning/saving industries. By November 1975, six joint
venture agreements had been signed, involving direct foreign investment of



-5-
about US$10-15 million. Romania also receives medium-term trade credits from
U.S. Eximbank and trades under ECGD, COFACE, and HERMES credit guarantees with
the United Kingdom, France and the Federal Republic of Germany, respectively.
Romania succeeded recently in securing a US$60 million, eight-year loan from
Kuwait as part of a general cooperation agreement.   In addition, Romania has
access to non-convertLble currency investment credits from the International
Investment Bank, Moscow, from which it has borrowed $30 million so far.
18.       As it stands, therefore, Romania's access to long-term finance in
convertible currencies is still very restricted. The IBRD is the only major
source of long-term development finance, though Romania is making efforts to
improve its access to the major financial markets. The Bank's presence on a
significant scale would have a positive influence in this regard, and the Bank
might serve as a catalyst for involving other lenders in Romania. This could
serve both to increase! the total amount of Bank-sponsored funds available to
Romania and to build coutside confidence in the country, thereby enhancing in
the long-term its independent access to the world's financial market.
Prospects
19.       The new Five-Year Plan (1976-80) reflects Romania's continued
strategy of rapid growth. Investment rates of 33 to 34 percent of national
income are to be maintained, and the major thrust is in industry. While light
industry is to continue its growth, the heavy industry branches are to grow
more rapidly. Continued emphasis is to be maintained on foreign trade and co-
operation, with the aim of securing a continued transfer of technology needed
for the modernization and diversification of Romanian industry. Greater em-
phasis than in the 1971-75 Plan is to be given to developing the infrastruc-
ture in agriculture, particularly with regard to irrigation and drainage and
the plans for fertilizer production envisage an increase in supply sufficient
to double the 1974 per hectare application by 1980.
20.       Romania has good potential for further economic growth.   Endowed
with important natural resources (fuels, some minerals, timber, rich soils
and a favorable climate both for agriculture and tourism) and located con-
veniently with respect to its major international markets in the East and
West, the country has built a broad industrial infrastructure (power, metal-
lurgy, chemicals) which will serve as a base for the expansion of secondary
manufacturing sectors Esuch as machine building and consumer durables. Above
all, Romania has a hard-working and increasingly skilled population.
21.       Economic growth and structural change call for the introduction of
new technologies, improvements in the quality of products, more economic use
of materials and factor inputs, and reductions in production costs. The in-
creasing diversity and complexity of Romania's economic structure require
continuing improvements in the efficiency of economic planning and coordina-
tion and further refinements in economic management. To keep uP with these
changes and requirements, large programs of education and manpower training
have been mounted, and efforts are being made to strengthen technical coop-
eration with industrialized countries and international organizations.



-6-
Creditworthiness
22.       At the end of December, 1975 Romania's total medium- and long-term
external debt amounted to $2,653 million. Most of these debts ($2,578 mil-
lion) were denominated in convertible currencies, the major creditor coun-
tries being Germany, France, UK and Italy. While the total debt does not
appear excessive in relation to the volume and growth of external trade,
average maturities are relatively short and convertible debt service pay-
ments are estimated to be in the order of $550 million a year during 1976.
The convertible debt service ratio was approximately 16 percent in 1975.
23.       The organization of economic activity in Romania, and the pursuit
of a development strategy involving high investment/saving rates and rapid in-
come growth, ensure Romania's capacity to service external debt if domestic
resources can be converted into foreign exchange for that purpose. Moreover,
the country's major efforts to expand exports (particularly to convertible
currency areas), to attract private joint venture capital and to seek other
forms of bilateral convertible currency financing are increasing the foreign
exchange available for debt service. Convertible export earnings rose from
US$830 million in 1971 to US$2,619 million in 1974. The preferential trade
status accorded to Romania by the European Communities in June 1973 should
facilitate the further expansion of such exports as should the recent grant-
ing of most favored nation status by the U.S. In 1973, the Government also
restricted the use of short-term credit facilities from western suppliers in
an effort to improve the structure of the country's external debt. Assuming
a continuation of present export and debt management policies it can be
expected that the debt service ratio will stabilize during the second half of
the 1970's. The country's present outward-looking posture, the success of
both its domestic growth and foreign trade policies, and its potential for
continued development, all support the judgment that Romania is creditworthy
for substantial Bank lending.
24.       When Romania joined the Bank, most pre-war foreign debts of the
country had been settled. The only settlements which were still under dis-
cussion at that time concerned claims in the United Kingdom and in the United
States. With regard to the settlement of claims against Romania's pre-war debt,
the final payments of U.S. claims began in September and will be completed by
October 1976, based upon agreements reached in May 1975. Settlement of British
claims proved more difficult, but a major breakthrough was achieved during the
visit of Prime Minister Wilson to Bucharest in September 1975 and a final
agreement was signed in January 1976.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN ROMANIA
25.       The proposed loan would be the Bank's eighth operation in Romania,
and it would bring total Bank commitments to Romania to $400 million.   Bank
lending to Romania began in June 1974 with the $60 million loan for the Bacau
Fertilizer Project. This operation was followed in July 1974 by the $70 mil-
lion loan for the Otelinox Special Steel Project and the $60 million loan for
the Turceni Thermal Power Project, and in January 1975 by the $70 million loan
for the Giurgiu-Razmiresti Irrigation Project and the $30 million loan for the
Sadova-Corabia Agricultural Credit Project. Two loans of $40 million and $20
million were made in November 1975 for the Flood Recovery Project. Initially
disbursements under these loans have been slow, but have been expedited in
recent weeks; the awarding of contracts under several of these loans is ex-
pected to result in further increased disbursement rates during 1976. Annex
II contains a summary statement of Bank loans to Romania and notes on the
execution of ongoing projects as of February 29, 1976.
26.       Foreign exchange, especially in convertible currencies continues to
be a major constraint and one of the major objectives of Bank lending continues
to be to help alleviateB the country's shortage of foreign exchange by providing
long-term external capital and by financing projects which will expand foreign
exchange earnings or savings. Bank lending also aims at supporting the Govern-
ment's efforts to introduce new industrial technologies to improve the quality
of products, and production efficiency, to reduce production costs and to pro-
vide for necessary electric power development. Market aspects and marketing,
especially for export goods, are also emphasized. Special attention is given
to agriculture which iEi heavily dependent upon favorable weather and where
productivity levels are still comparatively low.
27.       With regard to the prospects for future lending, a further project
for irrigation has been appraised and is expected to be ready for considera-
tion by the Executive Elirectors soon. The possibilities of financing projects
for agricultural credit, anti-friction bearings and heavy machinery are under
consideration.
28.       In addition to lending, the Bank (through EDI) has assisted Romania
by conducting project appraisal training courses for Romanian officials in
Belgrade in October 1973, and in Bucharest in January/February and November/
December 1975 and in February/March 1976. This assistance will be continued
and expanded to include other sectors.
29.       The projects, for which assistance has been committed or is being
considered, represent only a small portion of Romania's total need for ex-
ternal financing and of its total disbursed convertible debt. However, they
will provide a substantlal net addition to the inflow of convertible currency
finance, and may set a pattern for obtaining longer term convertible finance
from other sources. The disbursed Bank debt outstanding is expected to con-
stitute about 11 percenit of Romania's total projected convertible currency debt
in 1980; the Bank's share in Romania's debt service payments in 1980 would be
about 4 percent.

PART III - THE POWER SECTOR IN ROMANIA
Energy Resources
30.       Romania relies predominantly on domestic sources of primary energy,
though in recent years imports of crude oil and coal have become important.
The country's single most important source of primary energy is natural gas,
accounting for 41 percent of total consumption in 1973. Of the balance, oil
accounted for about 30 percent, coke and coal for about 28 percent and hydro-
electricity for about 1 percent.
3
31.       Total gas production in 1973 was 30 billion m , of which 5 billion
m3 was derived from oil. At that time it was expected that production would
increase by about 1 billion m3 annually until 1975 with no increase there-
after. Known reserves are expected to provide 30-50 years supply of natural
gas at these extraction rates. As for crude oil, Romania consumed or pro-
cessed about 17 million tons in 1973 of which 13 million tons was from domestic
reserves. Domestic crude is generally of very high quality with less than
1.0 percent sulphur content. Of the country's coal reserves about 90 percent
consists of relatively low grade lignite (with a combustible content between
35 and 38 percent). Of a total reserve of around 9 billion tons, most of which
is in the Oltenia region, about 3 billion is considered economically exploitable.
32.       The Government's energy policy aims at diverting Romania's limited
gas reserves increasingly towards the use as feedstock for chemical industries,
and basing additional power generation on less valuable domestic resources such
as lignite and hydro power. This not only increases the value added obtained
from gas, but saves scarce foreign exchange for imports of fuel oil which would
otherwise be necessary, and lessens the risk of disruptions in raw material
supplies.
Electrical Energy
33.       The installed generating plant at the end of 1974 was 10,676 MW de-
livering 43,301 GWh of which 10,218 MW or 96 percent was interconnected. The
plant comprises 2,383 MW hydro and 8,293 MW thermal plant, including some small
diesel and 109 MW of gas-turbine installations. Of the total 9,500 MW was in
charge of the Ministry of Electrical Energy whilst the remainder represented
plant installed at industrial works. The transmission system comprised at the
end of 1973 196,814 km of lines at all voltages of which 2,131 km at 400 kV,
2,733 km at 220 kV, and 9,976 km at 110 kV. Subtransmission/distribution in
the range of 1-60 kV accounted for 76,753 km of lines with the remaining
105,221 km being at less than 1 kV.
34.       In 1974, the thermal plant output was 37,902 GWh and was derived
from the following fuels: gas and fuel oils 60.0 percent, lignite 9.8 percent,
coal 27.4 percent and other fuels including secondary sources 2.8 percent.



- 9 -
The largest operating steam units are 315 MW at Craiova and are lignite-fired.
Further units of similar size and type (330 MW) are being commissioned at
Rovinari and Turceni (Loan No. 1028) in the Oltenia Region. Future thermal
development will concentrate on the utilization of indigenous solid fuel and
by 1980 some 3,930 MW of lignite fuelled plant will be consuming about 33
million tons p.a. Assuming that after 1980 the second stage of the Turceni
project (Loan 1028-.RO) will be commissioned requiring a further 11 million
tons p.a., then almost the full potential of Romania's lignite deposits with
an estimated life of exploitation of 70 years, will have been committed.
35.       Romania's hydro-potential is assessed at 12,300 MW capable of pro-
viding 37,000 GWh p.a. from 630 sites, of which 2,400 MW providing 12,300 GWh
p.a. is located in five sites on the Danube. At the end of 1975 2,622 MW or
22 percent of the total hydro potential had been developed. The largest hydro-
power station in operation is the Iron Gates I on the Danube which was completed
in 1972 and which contributes 40 percent to the total 1975 hydro capacity of
the country. A further 1,800 MW (15 percent of the resources) is presently
either under construction or committed. Of the uncommitted balance of 7,878 MW,
about 1,340 MW is located at four sites on the Danube with the Cernavoda scheme
(850 MW) being the Largest. The remainder would need to be exploited at a
large number of sma'Ll sites with an average capacity of 11 MW; of these only a
few would individually contribute appreciably to the system capacity. The
Riul Mare Project is the largest of the remaining sites which can be exploited
at an acceptable cost while most of the others are presently too expensive to
justify development. Future hydro-development will be accelerated as far as
economically justified and with the exception of the Danube schemes, hydro
development will be best suited to meet the system peaking demands.
36.       The first nuclear power generating plant of Romania with a capacity
of 440 MW is being constructed and is expected to be commissioned in 1981/82.
This would be followed by further plant of 1,090 MW in 1983 and 650 MW in
1985. Negotiations for the supply of equipment, know-how and manufacturing
licenses are well underway. Efforts are also being made to search for geo-
thermal resources but detailed information is not available.
The Market for Elect:ric Energy
37.       Electricity supply is available to more than 90 percent of the
villages in Romania and 100 percent of the towns and cities. Average annual
consumption of electricity per capita was about 1,700 kWh in 1974. Total
energy consumption within the country was divided as follows: industry 77
percent, domestic 9 percent, commerce 8 percent, and agriculture 6 percent.
Of the country's total electricity production of 43,301 GWh, about 8 percent
was exported principally to Czechoslovakia via USSR.
38.       Romania presently has some 13,150 villages.    In 1960, 3,427 of these
had been electrified. In the next five years (1961-65), 617 villages were
electrified on average each year.   In 1966-70 the rate increased to 815 p.a.



- 10 -
Thereafter, as the remainder became increasinRly remote the rate dropped to
slightly more than 500 per year. By 1972, 88.5 percent had heen electrified
and the balance is being completed at the rate of 500 per vear so that electric
Dower is now available to virtuallv all inhabitants of the countrv.
Development Program
39.       The Government attaches high orioritv to the development of the
electric power sector because it considers the development of this sector as
an essential element of, and prerequisite for, the develonment of Romania
as a whole. State Plans in the past have included investment orojects which
substantially increased the production caDacity of the power sector. Also,
for the period up to at least 18n further substantial capacity increases
are envisaged in order to make the most economical use of the existing Dower
resources of the country and match consumption which is estimated to grow by
7 percent for the years 1976-80 followed by a growth of 6 percent to 1985.
Total investments to support the planned growth in the power sector over the
year 1976-80 amount to lei 62.86 billion (US$3.1 billion equivalent).
40.       While in making develoDment plans for the power sector, the devel-
opment needs and financial resources of the whole economy are taken into con-
sideration, it is the Government's Dolicy to ensure that a substantial Part
of the investments in the power sector are financed from funds which are
generated in the sector itself.   Thus, in the period up to 1985 it is forecast
that about 30 percent of the investments in the sector will be financed from
funds generated bv power sector enternrises. Consequently, it is also the
Government's policy to ensure that prices in the power sector are at a level
sufficient to cover operating and administration expenses (including mainten-
ance, depreciation and taxes, if any) and to produce a reasonable level of
net income.
Organization of the Sector
41.       The Ministry of Electrical Energy (MEE) administers the sector through
a board comprising the minister, three deputv ministers and the various direc-
tors of subordinate units. Power production, transmission and distribution
facilities are operated by enterDrises of which there are 16 for generation
and 17 for distribution, all of which are subordinated to the Industrial
Central for Electric Power and Beat (CIEET). The Central serves as a head-
office for the enterprises collating and monitoring their investment and Pro-
duction plans, supervising their activities and reviewing their finances.
42.       The design institutes and the constructien trusts are subordinated
to the MEE and are resnonsible for the preoarnrinn, design, construction and
supervision of ma,or Deoer projects in Rforanin. including the "iuil \',ire



- 11 -
Retezat Project. There are also foreign trade enterprises dealing with the
sector which serve as agents in the procurement of equipment from abroad.
43.       Each enterprise is headed by a General Assembly of the Working People
which is represented by a Working Peoples Committee and an Operating Manage-
ment Collective. Executive responsibility is in the hands of the general
manager who decides on and supervises the daily operations of the enterprise.
Execution of the Riul Mare Project is presently directed by the Cluj Enter-
prise which lies more than 150 km away from the Project and it has been de-
cided to set up a separate generating enterprise at Hatzeg which will be re-
sponsible for the management of the Project. More details about management
arrangements under the Project are described in para 50 below.
The Borrower
44.       The borrower for the proposed loan would be the Investment Bank,
which is the specialized agency, under the Ministry of Finance, for invest-
ment projects in all sectors of the economy except agriculture (including water
resources) and food processing. It has a large technical and economic staff
with branch offices in all districts of the country. The Investment Bank's
involvement in investment projects commences in the preparation phase of a
project; its staff appraises all major investment projects technically and
financially and recommends approval or otherwise of their financing to the
Council of Ministersi. When a particular project and its financial plan has
been approved by the Council of Ministers, all major funds are channeled through
the Investment Bank in accordance with the approved financial plan. All pay-
ments for the execut:ion of a project have to be authorized by the Investment
Bank which keeps separate accounts for each category in the financial plan for
every enterprise. It is the Investment Bank's obligation to ensure that a
project is executed according to the financial and technical data included in
the final technical and economic study approved by the CounciL of Ministers.
Its inspectors check whether the project is proceeding according to the schedule
approved in the Plan.
45.       While the Investment Bank's supervision and control function is thus
rather strong during the implementation phase of a project, its functions are
much more limited during the operation phase of a project. Although it has
the right and obligation to verify that the enterprise is meeting the targets
set in the investment plan, it has no legal authority to influence directly
the management of thea enterprise or to force the enterprise directly to take
operational actions which it considers necessary. In practice, however, it
can request such act:Lons very effectively by reporting through the Ministry
of Finance to the Govlernment. To ensure that the Hatzeg Enterprise meets the
requirements specified in the Loan Agreement (Section 4.01) concerning the
operations phase, thej Guarantor will see that the enterprise complies with
these requirements (Esee Section 2.03 of the Guarantee Agreement).



- 12 -
The Investment Bank is the channel for all sources of major domestic
investment financing, but its own funds are still relativelv small. Its prime
source of funds is the State Budget. The Guarantee Agreement, therefore,
includes a orovision (Section 2.02) that the Guarantor will ensure availability
of sufficient funds for the implementation and operation of the Droject. The
Guarantor will ensure that the Investment Bank can meet the debt service on
the Bank loan.  In view of the status of the Investment Bank within the gov-
ernment svstem, it is considered sufficient to relv in this resDect on the
Guarantee Agreement (Section 2.01).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
47.       The project was identified in late 1974 and appraised in June 1975
on the basis of a technical and economic studv prepared bv the Government's
Institute for Hydroelectrical Studies ard Desigrs (ISPH). Negotiations were
held in Washington in January/February 1976. The Romarian delegation was led
bv Mr. Diamandonol. President of the Investment Bank.
Project Desc ri_ t_ion
48.       The Riul Mare Retezat Hydropower Project is the key component of a
complex development scheme on the Riul Mare and the Strei rivers. Its detailed
analysis, as well as the initiation of corstruction, was included in Romania's
Five-Year Plan for 1971-75. Major construction works will span the Period
1976-83.  The Project's main components include construction of:
(a)  a reservoir to be formed by a 173 m high clav cored rock-fill
dam across the vallev of the Riul Mare river with 25 secondarv
intakes and an 18.4 km long pressure tunnel to convey the
water to the power station;
(b)  a two unit minderground power plant of 335 'RW (Retezat) and a
14 MUl above ground powerhouse (Clopotiva) downstrear of Retezat;
(c) transmission lines at 110 kV to connect the Retezat and the
Clonotiva power stations and at 220 kV to connect the Retezat
power station with the existing svstem
(d)  roads required for the execution of the project which will later
serve general communication purposes.
49.       A further power station (Ostrovuil-Mic) doxnstream of Clopotiva is
being built and would he completed before commissioning of the project works.
This power plant will also serve to reregulate the short duration discharges
from the Riul Mare plant. i. Loan and Project Summary is given in Annex III.
The Appraisal Report entitled "Appraisal of the Riul Mare-Retezat Hydropower
Project' is being distributed to the Executive Directors separatelv.

Project Execution
50.       Responsibilities for project execution have been delegated to sev-
eraL agencies but the Hatzeg Enterprise will have overall responsibility for
the coordination of project execution. The Institute of Hydroelectrical Studies
and Designs (ISPH) of the Ministry of Electrical Energy and the Design Insti-
tute for Studies and Projects for Power Station Equipment (ICPET) of the Minis-
try of Heavy Machinery are responsible for basic design and engineering and the
technical aspects of b:Ld specification and evaluation. They will also super-
vise the construction of civil, electrical and mechanical works. Civil works
will be carried out by the Hydropower Construction Trust (TCH); the Electro-
Mechanical Construction Trust (TEnM) will perform the erection and commission-
ing of the electro-mechaanical plant in the power stations, the transmission
works will be undertaken by the Transmission and Substation Construction
Trust (TEM) and various other organizations are involved in roads, water sup-
ply, forestry, and other related matters. The procurement of equipment and
materials required for the project and financed by the Bank loan will be the
responsibility of the foreign trade enterprise ROMENERGO and other procurement
agencies. Goods and services required for the project and to be supplied from
within Romania will be procured directly by the Hatzeg Enterprise with the
guidance of the design :Lnstitutes ISPH and ICPET. The Investment Bank will
effect a technical and administrative audit during the investment period.
ProJect Cost and Financing
51.       The total cost of the project is estimated to be the equivalent of
US$250.1 million. The foreign exchange component is US$53.8 million or 21.5
percent of the total. The appraisal cost estimates for local works and sup-
plies are based on fixed Romanian prices which are unlikely to change signif-
icantly and a price contingency of 2 percent is considered adequate. Physical
contingency has been allowed at 10 percent on the cost of the project. For
directly imported foreign goods as well as the electrical and mechanical
equipment for the power stations, a price increase of 7-1/2 percent p.a.
during project execution has been assumed.
52.       The proposed Bank loan of $50 million is expected to finance about
20 percent of the estimated total project cost and about 93 percent of the
project's foreign exchange component. Interest on the Bank loan during con-
struction and the remaining project cost would be financed by Romanian sources.
For the sector as a whole, the investment program of the Industrial Central
over the period 1975-81 requires 87 billion Lei (about US$4.4 billion equiva-
lent) of which about 30 percent is expected to be derived from the Power
Central's own sources and the balance from the State Budget and external
sources.

Lending Terms
53.       The proposed loan to the Investment Bank would be guaranteed by the
Government. It is Romanian practice for the State to invest virtually all
funds in such projects through the Investment Bank without formal onlending
agreements and to recover investment costs from project beneficiaries through
a variety of financial mechanisms including net income transfers from State
enterprises, taxes and depreciation payments. For this reason the Investment
Bank would not actually relend the Bank loan to the enterprise. However,
the enterprise would be the beneficiary of the Bank loan and its provision
of funds to the State Budget and Investment Bank would be sufficient to cover
the lei equivalent of the debt service on the Bank loan (Section 4.01(h) of
the Loan Agreement).
Audit
54.       Romania has developed a system of auditing primarily to ensure that
the investment and production activities of enterprises conform to state plans.
Any deviations are brought to the attention of higher authorities. Each en-
terprise and the industrial central has its own internal controllers, appointed
by the Ministry of Energy with the approval of the Ministry of Finance, who
carry out a basic annual audit. As provided under the first power project the
Bank would receive annual reports of the Hatzeg Enterprise and the Borrower
prepared by the Ministry of Finance (Section 6.01(e) and (f) of the Loan
Agreement). Also, a letter supplemental to the Loan Agreement to be delivered
by the Guarantor and the Borrower would provide for the Bank to receive annual
audit reports by the Ministry of Finance on the accounts and results of the
Industrial Central for Electric Power and Heat. The form of presentation of
the reports received so far under the first power project was not fully sat-
isfactory; consequently, it has been decided that this matter would be subject
of further discussions during the Bank's next supervision mission so that the
Bank's information requirements in this respect would adequately be met.
Procurement
55.       In view of the procurement delays and difficulties experienced under
the previous power loan for the Turceni Project (see Annex II) a list of goods
has been agreed upon from which items to be financed by the Bank loan would
be selected; procurement of these goods would follow international competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines and would be coordinated by ROMENERGO.
Local suppliers are expected to participate in most of the international com-
petitive bids. Since Romanian currency is not freely convertible, international
tender documents would state that a conversion rate of US$1:20 lei be used for
bid comparison. For purposes of bid comparison, local suppliers would be ac-
corded a preference of 15 percent or applicable customs duty, whichever is
lower.



- 15 -
Disbursements
56.       The Bank loan would be disbursed against the foreign currency ex-
penditure for imported equipment, components and materials and against the
ex-factory cost of locally procured equinment and materials. Disbursements
are expected to be completed by' December 1981. A schedule of expected dis-
bursements is given in Annex III.
Environment
57.       The Government has given specific attention to minimizing the nega-
tive effects of the project on the richly endowed environment of the area.
In fact the project is adjac-ent to a national park which includes a special
scientific reserve. As a result of recommendations made in a detailed Govern-
ment study on this matter the main pressure tunnel from the water reservoir
to the Retezat power plant has been relocated from the right bank of the river
to the left in order to avoid negative effects on the national park. The
secondary intake tunnel which traverses the national park will be excavated
so as to place the adits outside the scientific reserve, and road access will
be arranged to cause a minimum of disturbance. Abstraction of water through
the secondary intakes has been restricted in accordance with the recommenda-
tions of the ecological, study.   The appraisal mission considers that these
measures are adequate.
Justification
58.       A power sector planning model developed by Romanians in 1972 in-
dicated that additional peaking capacity of 400 MW would be required in the
system not later than 1985. The Riul Mare Project (349 MW) is expected to be
completed in 1983 and, with its associated down-stream development, is the
least-cost alternative from available schemes to fill this need. A comparison
with gas-turbine and pumtped-storage alternatives indicates that Riul Mare is
the preferred alternativre at discount rates at least up to 10 percent.
59.       An internal rate of return on the project has been estimated in
accordance with standard Bank methodology for power projects. Benefits have
been measured by incremental revenue attributable to the project, and finan-
cial costs have been adjusted for taxes and other internal transfers. The
resulting 6-1/2 percent rate of return reflects current Romanian tariffs and
costs which are set as part of an administered price system under provisions
of a 1971 law on prices. The tariffs themselves, which in the past have been
adequate to generate a substantial cash contribution to investments in the
sector, are considered to be only minimum indicators of the value of the bene-
fit attributable to sale of energy. It is likely that increasing real costs
of power sector development will lead to higher real tariffs. In this case
the rate of return would be commensurately higher.
60.       Aside from the output of electric power, other benefits are associ-
ated with the Project. River regulation will provide a perennially secure
flow in the Riul Mare and Strei rivers, the Gura Apelor reservoir recreational
benefits and road works which by extension beyond the Project area will serve
to improve communications. Such benefits are judged to be relatively small
and would not materially influence the Project's justification.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTRORITY
61.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Investment Bank,
the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Socialist Republic of Romania and
the Bank, the report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section
4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the draft resolution approving the
proposed loans are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
The special features of the loan documents are described above.
62.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
63.       I recommend that the Executive Director approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Ln. No. 1020-RO     Bacau Fertilizer Project; US$60 million Loan of
June 28, 1974; Effectiveness Date: December 31, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
This loan was approved by the Executive Directors on June 27, 1974.
It was signed on June 28 and became effective on December 31, 1974. By agree-
ment between the Bank and the Borrower, the project site was changed from
Tecuci to Bacau which is more advantageous from the point of view of controll-
ing effluents. After a slow start, due mainly to the change of site, lack of
familiarity with Bank procurement procedures, and the floods of spring 1975,
the project is now proceeding satisfactorily.
Ln. No. 1027-RO     Otelinox Special Steel Project; US$70 million Loan of
July 10, 1974; Effectiveness Date: April 4, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
This loan was approved by the Executive Directors on July 5, 1974.
It was signed on July 10 and became effective on April 4, 1975. Execution
of the project has been delayed several months, primarily because of the com-
plexity of two large bid packages and because of the Romanians' lack of famil-
iarity with international competitive bidding procedures under the Bank's
Guidelines. Progress on procurement has been closely monitored by several
Bank supervision missions. Bids for the cold mill have been evaluated and
the final revisions of the contract for its construction are expected to be
submitted to the Bank for approval shortly. Bids for the hot mill are ex-
pected in May.
Ln. No. 1028-RO     Turceni Thermal Power Project; US$60 million Loan of
July 10, 1974; Effectiveness Date: November 6, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
This loan was approved by the Executive Directors on July 5, 1974.
It was signed on July 10 and became effective November 6, 1974. Physical
execution is proceeding smoothly. The project cost is likely to be US$377
million which is 6.6% above the appraisal estimate and the foreign cost is
now likely to be US$100 million which is 12.3% over the appraisal estimate.
Delivery times for vital foreign supply components threaten to delay the
commissioning of at least the first of the four steam-turbine units. There
have been some delays in construction works due to slowness in preparing
final designs for some works and in organizing timely delivery of materials
and supplies to site. As a result the critical path schedule for execution
of the project is being revised. Major problems were experienced with pro-
curement following a decision of the Council of Ministers to restrict the
value of contracts for thermal power station components and related equip-
ment to be awarded after international competitive bidding to US$20.0 million,
and to utilize the balance of the loan to finance imported supplies for local
manufacturers of thermal power station equipment. Discussions to resolve this
matter are in process.

Ln. No. 1982-RO      Giurgiu-Razmiresti Irrigation Project; US$70 million Loan
of February 6, 1975; Effectiveness Date: May 5, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
This loan was approved by the Executive Directors on January 28, 1975.
It was signed on February 6 and became effective on May 5, 1975. The first
supervision mission was in June 1975. Construction of two main pumping stations,
several pressure puaping stations, power supply lines, canal excavation and
lining, and canal st:ructures has begun. The rate of progress is slow, however,
because of shortage of construction equipment. International procurement has
been delayed because of a delay in appointing consultants to assist with this
work. Because of Romania's lack of familiarity with international competitive
bidding procedures, bid documents prepared for the project hacd to be revised
and bid opening was delayed to April 5. After completion of bid evaluations in
spring 1976, project execution and disbursement can be expected to improve.
Ln. No. 1083-RO      Sadova-Corabia Agricultural Credit Project; US$30 million
'Loan of February 6, 1975; Effectiveness Date: April 29,
l975; Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
This loan was approved by the Executive Directors on January 28, 1975.
It was signed on February 6 and became effective on April 29, 1975. Progress
of the project is satisfactory. Contracts for purchasing refrIgerated trucks,
building materials, steel products and electrical cables have been awarded.
Procurement of chemicals has been initiated. Bids for the premix feed mill have
been received and formula testing is being carried out as part of bid evaluation
which is scheduled for completion in April.
Ln. No. 1169-RO      Flood Recovery Project; US$40 million Loan of November 12,
1975; Effectiveness Date: December 2, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1979.
This loan wEIs approved by the Executive Directors on November 4,
1975. It was signed on November 12 and became effective on December 2, 1975.
Project execution is p,roceeding well and disbursements are ahead of schedule.
Documentation for international competitive bidding is being combined with that
for the Giurgiu-Razmiresti Irrigation Project above.
Ln. No. 1170-RO      Flood Recovery Project: US$20 million Loan of November 12,
1975; Effectiveness Date: December 2, 1975; Closing Date:
March 31, 1977.
This loan was approved by the Executive Directors on November 4,
1975. It was signed on November 12 and became effective on December 2, 1975.
Disbursements under the loan have been slower than anticipated because of dif-
ficulties encountered in Romania in preparing and assembling doclmentation for

Project
Description:  The Project would comprise the construction of:
(a) a reservoir called Gura Apelor to be formed by a
clay-cored, rock-fill dam, Tomeasa, 173 m high across
l:he valley of the Riul Mare in the neighborhood of
Mlount Retezat from which the Project takes its name.
I high pressure tunnel 18.4-km long conveys the reservoir
releases to the Retezat underground power plant of 335 MW
h,aving two units working with a gross head of 583 m.
Ihe tailrace of Retezat is also the headrace of the
above-ground 14-MW powerhouse, Clopotiva, which uses a
head of 25 m. There are 25 secondary intakes which
collect water from adjacent streams and drop it into
the pressure tunnel or convey it through a tunnel 34 km
long to Gura Apelor reservoir;
(b)  transmission lines at 110 kV will interconnect the
Retezat-Clopotiva power stations and 220-kV lines will
connect the Retezat power station with the existing
system at Burul Mare;
(c) rcadworks needed for the execution of the Project are
in hand. These will later serve general communication
and tourism purposes.
