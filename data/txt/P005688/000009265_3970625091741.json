        framework of a general macro-economic restructuring program.\n            The Government's macro-economic restructuring program\n            is focusing on measures to limit growth of domestic demand ,\n            to stimulate growth of non-traditional exports and to\n            improve the allocation and use of scarce economic resources.\n            It should also result in a more rapid creation of new\n            employment and reduced underemployment. The foreign exchange\n            provided by the Loan would be used to finance general\n            imports based on a negative list and technical assistance\n            for a study of productivity standards. The reforms supported\n            by the proposed Loan are expected to create a more favorable\n            environment for overall economic and sectoral growth at a\n            time of resource constraints."}, "docdt": "1987-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
