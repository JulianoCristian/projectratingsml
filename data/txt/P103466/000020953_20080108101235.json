        Credit (PRSC-11) of Mali is envisaged as a single-tranche\n            operation, to support the Government's medium-term\n            program ensuring budget support for Mali's fiscal year\n            (FY) 2008. The PRSC-11 would be the second in a series of\n            two programmatic loans (PRSCs) designed to provide support\n            to Mali's Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy\n            Framework (GPRSF), consistent with the Bank's Country\n            Assistance Strategy (CAS). Building on PRSC-1, the operation\n            would: a) strengthen oversight of public finances and the\n            procurement system, thereby enhancing efficiency and\n            effectiveness of public sector spending; b) provide the\n            incentive to implement key economic, social and\n            institutional reforms to strengthen overall economic\n            performance, growth and poverty alleviation; and c) ensure\n            delivery of basic services in view of reaching the\n            Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), particularly in the\n            health and water sectors."}, "docdt": "2007-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
