moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately unsatisfactory. Ratings for the Second\n            Poverty Reduction Support Credit Project for Mali were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, the risk\n            to development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance\n            was moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            a selective focus on policy areas with already concrete\n            reform actions or strong prospects for reforms is preferable\n            for a PRSC series. The first PRSC series did not make a real\n            break from the past. It was complex, lacked selectivity, was\n            heavy on processes and was not sufficiently focused on\n            outcomes.  Not surprisingly, the results are broadly similar\n            to those obtained in the previous ten years. While an\n            incremental approach can serve to build up a consensus for\n            parts of a broader reform agenda that require more\n            consensus-building, there is a risk of loss of focus when\n            this incremental process approach is applied across the\n            board to a broad and complex range of policy reform areas.\n            Monitoring and evaluation is an essential part of any\n            Bank-supported operation. It is important to ensure, during\n            preparation and approval of the operation, that there is a\n            sound but simple monitoring and evaluation system within\n            Government's institutions. Few indicators should be\n            selected, with an emphasis on outcome rather than output or\n            process indicators. The links between policy actions and\n            indicators should be clarified and credible, and the\n            selection of indicators should take into account limitations\n            in the availability of data and not impose additional costs\n            to the Government."}, "docdt": "2009-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
