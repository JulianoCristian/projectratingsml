Credit Objectives
The ERC seeks to assist the Government of Mali to deepen its
adjustment strategy, to ensure that the gains in competitiveness are
consolidated, social sector expenditures for 1994 are protected in
real terms, and the adverse effects of the devaluation on vulnerable
groups is minimized.
Credit Description
The African Members of the Franc Zone decided to devalue their
currency, the CFA franc, effective January 12, 1994. The proposed
credit would support the post-devaluation reform program for 1994 as
outlined in the Government Statement of Economic and Social Policy
dated February 26, 1994 whose main objectives are private sector led
growth and the alleviation of poverty. The Malian Government has
already taken a series of key macroeconomic and structural measures to
regain and consolidate competitiveness. These measures include: (i)
the devaluation of the CFA franc from 50CFAF to 100CFAF/lFF; (ii) an
increase in the base producer price of prime quality cotton of at
least 35w; (iii) a program of social measures to mitigate the effects
of the devaluation on vulnerable groups; (iv) prudent demand
management policies to reduce public sector absorption and limit
public wage increases; (v) reduction and simplification of the tariffs
and domestic taxation; and (vi) protection of social expenditures in
real terms. The ERC is designed to support implementation of these
measures in 1994.
Implementation arrangements (Procurement and disbursement)
The proposed Credit would be of SDR18.2 million (US$ million
equivalent). Due to the urgent nature of the operation, the entire
credit is proposed for disbursement in a single tranche shortly after



effectiveness.   Proceeds of the credit would reimburse 1009 of the
foreign exchange costs of eligible imports, of public or private
sector origin, except for negative list and imported goods already
funded under bilateral or multilateral credits. The proposed date of
eligibility would be set in light of the Government's preparation of a
deepened austerity program in August 1993. In order to permit timely
disbursements in the amounts needed to keep to program targets, the
full amount of the credit would be eligible for retroactive financing.
August 2, 1993 is proposed as the cut-off date for retroactive
financing.
Environmental Category
In conformity with IDA policies for adjustment operations, no
environmental rating has been assigned. However, the operation would
be consistent with IDA policy and would follow acceptable IDA
procedures.
