The main reason for\n            success was the strong ownership of reform agenda and\n            sustained commitment by the Malian Government to strengthen\n            its policy reforms and its open dialogue with the Bank. The\n            following factors, subject to Government control, positively\n            affected the program implementation: (i) strong commitment\n            of the Government and its open dialogue with the Bank-; (ii)\n            the Government's clear vision of the objectives of the\n            economic reform program and its willingness to adopt the\n            appropriate means to achieve the objectives; (iii) an\n            effective mass media campaign to inform and educate the\n            public about the merits and consequences of the devaluation\n            and the accompanying policy reforms; and (iv) effective\n            utilization of available funds from other donors which were\n            used to help design and implement economic reforms. Overall,\n            IDA's experience with the ERC has been positive. The\n            following observations emerge from the ERC's\n            implementation record and outcome: (i) Strong Government\n            Commitment. A sine qua non for success in the design and\n            implementation of an emergency financing program is strong\n            and sustained Government commitment to the policy reform\n            package, as well as dynamic leadership and full ownership of\n            the program by the Government. (ii) Up-front\n            Conditionalities and Single Tranche Disbursement. As a\n            short-term financing instrument, the ERC was well designed\n            to respond on time to the immediate constraints faced by\n            Mali after the devaluation. (iii) Retroactive Financing. In\n            light of the urgent and extraordinary nature of the ERC, the\n            Bank decided on an exceptional basis to extend the period of\n            retroactive financing to August 2, 1993, about nine months\n            prior to credit effectiveness, in lieu of the normal four\n            months guidelines.  This decision led to faster disbursement\n            arrangements and facilitated quick and easy availability of\n            the credit proceeds."}, "docdt": "1996-06-25T16:09:04Z"}
