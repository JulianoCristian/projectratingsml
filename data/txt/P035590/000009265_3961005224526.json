"The African member countries of the\n            Franc zone decided to devalue their currency, the CFA franc,\n            effective January 12, 1994. The Economic Recovery Credit\n            Project will support the post-devaluation reform program as\n            outlined in the government's Statement of Economic and\n            Social Policy whose main objectives are private sector led\n            growth and the alleviation of poverty. The Malian government\n            has already taken a series of key macroeconomic and\n            structural measures to regain and consolidate\n            competitiveness. The credit is designed to support the\n            implementation of these measures in 1994. The major measures\n            are: (a) the devaluation of the CFA franc from 50 CFAF to\n            100 CFAF/1 FF; (b) increase in the producer price of prime\n            quality cotton by at least 35%; (c) a program of social\n            measures to attenuate the effects of the devaluation on\n            vulnerable groups; (d) prudent demand management policies to\n            reduce absorption by the public sector and limit wage\n            increases; (e) reduction and simplification of tariffs and\n            domestic taxation; and (f) protection of social sector expenditures."}, "docdt": "1994-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
