The project\n            partially achieved its objectives, its impact on\n            institutional strengthening was limited, sustainability is\n            uncertain at this time, and the Bank's performance was\n            mixed while the Borrower's was not satisfactory.\n            Several lessons can be learned from this project. First,\n            future credits should be reinforced by systemic reforms,\n            through FSAL and related programs, that specifically address\n            the elements jeopardizing PFIs' sustainability. Second,\n            SAR risk assessment should address institutional\n            creditworthiness issues, not just credit delivery. Third, to\n            optimize TA grants and minimize abuse, there should be a\n            project wide reassessment in case of significant deviations\n            from estimates. Fourth, the GOP can promote the success of\n            PFIs if it refrains from assigning non-financial and\n            non-economic roles to them. Fifth, PFIs should initiate and\n            welcome mergers if these constitute real options for\n            survival and growth. Lastly, non-proprietary TA components\n            should be widely circulated."}, "docdt": "1993-05-03T00:00:00Z"}
