support the\n            Government's efforts to improve the efficiency of the\n            delivery system for industrial finance by providing loans to\n            medium and large industrial enterprises in the private and\n            the public sectors through five PFIs. To address\n            institutional weaknesses in the PFIs, technical assistance\n            and training is also included. While present Government\n            policies argue well for continued growth in the industrial\n            sector, the main risk for the proposed project is that the\n            PFIs would not achieve their lending targets because of\n            institutional difficulties or sluggish growth in the sector."}, "docdt": "1983-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
