The lessons\n            learned indicate that Problem projects that suffer from weak\n            initial design can be turned around - given concerted\n            efforts by both the Borrower and the Bank -- but there are\n            costs. In difficult institutional conditions, it is\n            especially important to match project ambitions and design\n            not only to borrower priorities but also to sector capacity\n            and broader public sector conditions. The challenges for\n            improving education quality and efficiency should not be\n            underestimated and the results of interventions cannot be\n            assumed. The development of secondary education faces it own\n            specific challenges that cannot be approached in the same\n            way as basic education. The Community Colleges component\n            yielded several lessons for post-secondary training in\n            Yemen: (i) fellowships for tutor training should be\n            conducted within the region whenever possible, to avoid the\n            need for extensive language training, and to increase the\n            likelihood that trainees will return to the country; (ii)\n            continuing to attract high quality applicants may depend on\n            accreditation of programs, with potential routes to further\n            or higher education, requiring in turn more coordination\n            between the Ministries of Technical and Vocational Education\n            and Training (TVET) and Higher Education; (iii) early\n            beneficiary participation is needed to ensure that courses\n            are matched to local demand and that equipment and space\n            needs are correctly identified."}, "docdt": "2005-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
