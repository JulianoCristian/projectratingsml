This will be\n            achieved through a Planned Change Program (PCP) designed to:\n            (a) enhance the learning achievements of secondary students\n            with special emphasis on science and mathematics education\n            and equality of teaching; (b) improve the access of girls to\n            secondary education; and (c) establish labor market oriented\n            two-year post-secondary education programs covering\n            business, commerce and industry. The project includes\n            national and school-based subprojects designed to address\n            the broad policy objectives in eight change areas: physical\n            facilities, teacher performance, curriculum development,\n            school management, learning resources, student evaluation,\n            female access and community colleges. The reforms pursued\n            under the PCP have a long-term perspective which requires\n            evaluation and adjustment at different stages. The sector\n            approach provides the necessary flexibility for making\n            adjustments as the Program progresses, promotes the\n            application of objective criteria for the allocation of\n            funds to subprojects, and encourages cooperation and\n            coordination among beneficiaries through an Intermediary Agency."}, "docdt": "1994-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
