This suggests that\n            environmental and social impacts of the project, for the\n            most part, will be minimal, site-specific and manageable to\n            an accepted level. Part of the implementation activities of\n            PUAPA, in terms of pest management and pesticide is designed\n            to minimize the potential negative effects on human and\n            animal health and the environment which may arise in\n            particular as part of vector control, and to promote\n            integrated pest management. The main risks, in the case of\n            conventional pesticides are: ground surface water, water\n            wells, air, biodiversity and human health."}, "docdt": "2011-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
