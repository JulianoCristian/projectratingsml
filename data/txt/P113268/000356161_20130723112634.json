Project for Guinea were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was moderate; Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory and grantee performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: strong\n            involvement of producer organizations in project\n            implementation is a key factor for success on the ground.\n            Innovative solutions enable project implementation to\n            continue in a context of political instability and social\n            unrest. The project lost momentum because seed was not\n            delivered on time for planting. Procurement of seed and\n            fertilizer was delayed, and the government lost the proceeds\n            of the grant. Such circumstances demanded innovative\n            mechanisms to help the project stay afloat. Capable producer\n            organizations may be a good entry point for a sustainable\n            input distribution mechanism. Capacity building is essential\n            for public entities to fully match their capabilities to\n            their responsibilities in project implementation."}, "docdt": "2013-03-24T00:00:00Z"}
