                         Implementation Status Overview
                           Project implementation has been satisfactory, particularly given the very difficult country context and operating environment since December 2008. Due to the freeze on
                         disbursements, project targets were scaled back to correspond to the funds available in the designated account. The planned procurement of 2,000 tons of fertilizer was decreased
                         to 400 tons, the purchase of 2000 tons of certified seed from the network of farmer seed producers was decreased to 500 tons , the production of base seed was reduced from 90 to

                         During the 2009-10 cropping season, 500 tons of certified seed, 300 tons of fertilizer and 2,600 liters of pesticide were distributed to a total of 23, 825 smallholders cultivating rice on
                         a total of 8,075 hectares. The remaining 100 tons of fertilizer was distributed during the 2010-11 cropping season, along with the 600 tons of improved seed received as payment for
                         seed distributed during the 2009-10 season. Only 15 of the targeted 45 tons of base seed were produced due to weather related constraints. A sample of beneficiary plots indicated
                         average yield increases of greater than 60% (versus the targeted 30% increase).

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                          With the lifting of the disbursement freeze in January 2011, a retroactive extension of the closing date to June 30, 2012 was approved. This will allow the project to disburse the
                         remaining USD 3 million and reach the original development objectives.
