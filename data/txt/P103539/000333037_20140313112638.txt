F. Results Framework Analysis
Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The objective of the project was “to reduce the Recipient’s vulnerability to the catastrophic
flooding of its low-lying coastal area due in part to the rise in sea level as a result of global
climate change”. The project Global Environment Objective (GEO) aimed to raise awareness
to promote the application of physical infrastructure upgrades to reduce vulnerabilities
brought on by climate change. This focus shifting of the GEF Adaptation Program from the
development and implementation of adaptive measures to strengthen infrastructure, was to
increase the program’s robustness and effectiveness.

Revised Global Environment Objectives (as approved by original approving authority) and
Key Indicators and reasons/justifications
There were no changes to the Project Development Objective (PDO) or to the Global
Environment Objective (GEO) throughout the life of the Project.

H. Restructuring

March 2011 Project Restructuring. The level two project restructuring approved on April
4, 2011 included: (i) withdrawing the Project indicator “increased drainage relief capacity of
the EDWC to the Demerara River by 35%” (outcome indicator 3 of the CAP project
document, Annex 3), to reflect the reality of the project activities and main focus of the
project to provide technical engineering baseline studies for future interventions, designed to
reduce flood vulnerability; (ii) reallocating unused related funds from component 2 to
component 1 to cover the costs of the engineering studies (the proposed government financed
Component 2.1 – Widening of key drainage relief canals was withdrawn from the project and
was considered as a stand-alone project for the Cunha Canal -- one of five options selected on
the basis of least cost, maximum improvement in discharge capacity and ease of
implementation according to the Economic Analysis of the CAP project document, Annex 9);
(iii) extending the project closing date from 30 June 2011 to 31 March 2013 to allow time to
complete the studies.

March 2013 Project Restructuring. The level two project restructuring, approved March
22, 2013 included extending the project closing date from March 31, 2013 to August 30,
2013 to allow quality control and appropriate review of the work under the ‘Pre-investment
Studies for Design of Engineering Works and Supervision of Specific Adaptation Works’ and
to allow for preparation and completion of a contingency plan, that in compliance with the
Safety of Dams policy, would serve in case of an emergency situation of a breach of the East
Demerara Water Conservancy.

                          14
 
   1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
   1.1 Context at Appraisal

1. At least three-quarters of the Guyanese population of 762,3001 live in a 30 km band along the
   Atlantic coast. This is an area of reclaimed lands, much of it below the regional mean sea
   level. At least 40% of the population resides in Region 42,3 Demerara-Mahaica with the
   majority living along the low-lying coastal plains situated between a water storage basin and
   a protective seawall complex that includes the City of Georgetown, the capital of Guyana4.
   The East Demerara Water Conservancy (EDWC) and East Coast drainage and irrigation
   systems together provide water storage and flood control mechanisms, and also allow for bi-
   annual harvests of rice and sugar sectors that account for approximately 27% of the nation’s
   GDP. The system is however, highly vulnerable to sea level rise and changes in rainfall
   patterns. Gravity-based drainage systems in these areas are increasingly compromised by
   rising sea-levels whilst unmanaged developments and poorly maintained infrastructure have
   limited the efficiency of the system to cope with excess rainfall.

2. Every year floods affect the population of Guyana and in recent years more extreme rain
   events have also highlighted the vulnerability of the system to catastrophic failure. For
   example in January 2005, extreme rainfall caused widespread flooding which affected almost
   half of Guyana’s population. It is estimated that total damages from the disaster cost US$ 465
   million or 59% of Guyana’s Gross Domestic Product for 2004. In addition to regular flooding
   along the east coast, water levels in the EDWC have also regularly been above safe operating
   levels, weakening the dam and putting the dam at risk of catastrophic breaching. These flood
   events highlighted the shortcomings in the infrastructure (the canals, the sluices and the
   pumps) to drain flood water away quickly enough.

3. Since the devastating 2005 flood, the World Bank (WB) has been working with the GoG and
   other donor agencies in the development of a comprehensive strategy to increase the drainage
   capacity of the EDWC and coastal drainage systems, a multimillion effort that requires
   careful long term planning and close donor inter-agency coordination. This Conservancy
   Adaptation Project (CAP) was developed as a way to identify key future interventions and
   provide the donor community with a strategic master plan of pre-designed priority works,
   generating comprehensive hydrological and topographical datasets as well as hydraulic
   studies and modelling to inform GoG’s decision makers. Strengthening the EDWC system is
   a top priority for the GoG, who requested WB assistance in accessing GEF resources and
   supporting its efforts to mitigate the country’s vulnerabilities to flooding. The project was one
   of the first to be funded under the GEF Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) and that fully
   met their criteria. The CAP built on the GoG’s Initial National Communication to the
   UNFCCC (2002), the Guyana National Vulnerability Assessment (2002) and the Integrated
   Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) Action Plan (2000).

4. This project emerged at a time when the Bank had a limited role in the country and was
   focusing on supporting the country’s Poverty Reduction Strategy and debt relief, in the
   context of the Enhanced HIPC (E-HIPC) of 2000. The Bank’s activities were more focused
   on providing non lending services on core economic and sector work. The GEF Special

   Climate Change Fund provided the opportunity to solve a national problem by assessing risk
   and generating analytical tools to effectively reduce vulnerability of catastrophic flooding.

   1.2 Original Project Development Objective (PDO)/Global Environment Objective
       (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

5. The Project Development Objective was to reduce the Recipient's vulnerability to the
   catastrophic flooding of its low-lying coastal area due in part to the rise in sea level as a result
   of global climate change.

6. This PDO was designed to be achieved through:
       Strengthening of GoGs and donor understanding of the EDWC system and coastal
          drainage regimes while identifying key drainage regimes for follow-on intervention;
       Implementing infrastructure investments aimed at increasing the drainage capacity of
          the EDWC; and
       Strengthening institutional capacity of the GoG to manage water levels in the EDWC
          and to guide interventions aimed at reducing Guyana’s vulnerability to floods.

7. Accordingly, the Project’s original key indicators were:
      1) Development of a hydraulic engineering foundation critical for flood control
         management;
      2) Identification of at least 10 key drainage regimes for follow-on intervention; and
      3) Increased drainage relief capacity of the EDWC to the Demerara River by 35%.

8. The project Global Environment Objective (GEO) aimed to raise awareness to promote the
   application of physical infrastructure upgrades to reduce vulnerabilities brought on by climate
   change.

   1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
   and reasons/justification

9. There were no revisions to the PDO/GEO during the life of the project, although following
   recommendations from the Project’s Mid-Term Review (MTR), a second level restructuring
   introduced changes to the scope of some of the components and to the PDO indicators.
   Details are summarized below.

10. This US$ 5 million-project included a contribution of US$ 1.2 million from the Government
    for widening of key drainage relief canals. The GoG sought external funding/co-financing
    from donors to secure these resources for the Cunha Canal Rehabilitation works, one of the
    works under Component 2. In March 2010, an Environmental Assessment (EA) for the
    Cunha Canal indicated that lands originally conceived as vacant (CAP PAD, section IV
    Appraisal- e: Environmental Management) were in fact occupied, and that the proposed re-
    alignment of the canal was encumbered by a fence, a steel bridge and a shed. The evaluation
    indicated that the proposed works at the Cunha Canal would require triggering the
    Involuntary Resettlement Safeguard (OP/BP 4.12), and the development of a resettlement
    plan, which would add considerably to the timeline for this investment.

11. A Mid-Term-Review (MTR) was carried out in June 2010, which considered the
    recommendations of the EA, and discussed with other partner agencies proposed next steps
    for implementation. At that time and considering the progress of the project, the UK’s

                                                    16
    
   Department for International Development (DfID) had to reallocate funds originally expected
   to finance works at the Cunha Canal.

12. Based on the final MTR recommendations, a project restructuring included the following
    revisions to the project: (i) eliminate the Project indicator “increased drainage relief capacity
    of the EDWC to the Demerara River by 35%” (outcome indicator 3 in the Project Results
    Framework and Monitoring), to reflect the reality of the project activities, reflecting the focus
    on providing technical engineering baseline studies to reduce flood vulnerability; (ii)
    reallocate unused related funds from component 2 to component 1 to cover the costs of the
    engineering studies, given that the proposed government financed Cunha Canal’s work was
    withdrawn from the project and was considered as a stand-alone project; and (iii) extend the
    project closing date from 30 June 2011 to 31 March 2013 to allow time to complete the
    studies. It is worth noting that some funds from component 3 were also reallocated to
    component 1 for the same engineering studies.

13. The MTR recommended a revision of the PDO/GEO objective to emphasize that the
    reduction of vulnerability to catastrophic flooding was going to be achieved by “providing a
    comprehensive engineering baseline and analytical tools allowing Guyana to develop a
    program of strategic interventions and policies to address recurrent flooding and the
    anticipated impacts resulting from climate change and sea level rise”. This new expanded
    PDO/GEO would have more explicitly reflected the main objective of supporting the GoG in
    the reduction of their vulnerability through a program consisting of structural and non-
    structural measures (i.e. repair of sluices and hydraulic modelling). However, given that the
    revised wording would not substantially change the PDO, and that the processing of a first
    order restructuring would have required approval from the GEF council resulting in an
    implementation delay at a time when moving forward and ensuring successful completion of
    the engineering designs was critical to meeting project objectives, it was decided to carry out
    a second order restructuring of the Project, maintaining the safeguards category and the
    PDO/GEO. A level two restructuring of the project was approved on April 4, 2011.

14. The Cunha Canal rehabilitation project remained a top priority for the country. Funding for
    this work was obtained from the Guyana REDD+ Investment Fund (GRIF) which was
    established in October 2010. The project is currently in its final stage of appraisal.
   1.4 Main Beneficiaries

15. The beneficiaries identified are the populations located to the north and west of the EDWC
    dam representing the majority of Guyana’s Region 4 population of 310,3005 (around 40% of
    Guyana’s population, 49% males, 51% females). Included in this population is the capital
    city, Georgetown with a population of 134,4976. The general population and in particular
    farmers and businesses will benefit because investments made during and resulting from the
    CAP are designed to help reduce the vulnerability of the highly populated coastal regions to
    catastrophic flooding, as well as reduce the impact of flooding on agricultural activities, one
    of Guyana’s main products, thus directly affecting GDP.

16. GoG national agencies dealing with drainage and irrigation and disaster risk management
    also benefit, including the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), the National Drainage and
    Irrigation Authority (NDIA), the Office of the President (OP), the MoA Hydrometeorological

   service (Hydromet), Guyana Land and Surveys Commission (GL&SC) and the Civil Defence
   Commission (CDC), Ministry of Works’ River and Sea Defence Unit and the Guyana
   Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) through better flood risk planning capacities,
   institutional strengthening and enhanced communications between agencies leading to an
   updated and strengthened national flood control strategy and through the availability and use
   of new datasets developed in the project;

17. GoG hydraulic engineers and hydrologists have benefitted through training in the operation
    and maintenance of hydro-meteorological monitoring instrumentation, and the use of new
    datasets and flow model technology to better plan follow-up interventions and more
    effectively manage water flows.

18. Indirect beneficiaries include coastal countries of the region (similar mainland areas and
    Caribbean islands at risk from flooding and sea-level rise) that could benefit from replicating
    tried and tested models and technologies used and developed within the CAP. The project
    serves as a demonstration for the development of adaptation interventions that can be
    implemented in similar contexts.

    1.5 Original Components (as approved)
19. The CAP was designed to finance a combination of non-structural and structural measures
    aiming at reducing the country’s vulnerability to flooding. This two-pronged approach
    involved, on the one hand, the development of a long-term comprehensive set of analytical
    tools that were needed for the design of a comprehensive flood management program for the
    coastal lowland drainage system. On the other, a few medium-term rehabilitation works and
    operational improvements aimed at enhancing the flood control capacity of the EDWC.

20. Component 1 – Pre-investment studies for engineering design of works (US$ 2.0 million
    from GEF). This component was designed to provide the hydrologic baseline necessary for
    contemplating rational interventions aimed at increasing the current discharge capacity of the
    flood control system, and included the following sub-components (from CAP, Annex 3,
    Results Framework and Monitoring):
              i) Detailed topographic and land use mapping;
              ii) Hydrologic modelling of coastal lowlands;
              iii) EDWC hydraulic modelling;
              iv) Assessment of EDWC system integrity;
              v) Pre-feasibility studies for coastal lowland interventions (omitted in the Annex 3
                   but included in the section II. Project Description); and
              vi) Operational capacity building.

21. One of the key outcomes of the pre-investment studies was a high resolution topographic
    model of the inhabited coastal plain designed to be used as the basis for hydrologic analysis
    of the region under observed and projected climate scenarios. The hydrologic analyses were
    designed to pinpoint key areas where interventions would improve the system discharge
    capacity critical for flood zone management. Pre-engineering designs for a set of prioritised
    interventions were also developed under this component. Training in the application of the
    analytical tools produced under the project was included for specialized staff within the GoG
    agencies.



                                                  18
    
22. Component 2 – Investments in specific adaptation measures (US$ 2.9 million; US$ 1.7
    million from GEF and US$ 1.2 million from GoG). Investments to be made under this
    component were designed to improve the ability of the GoG to manage water levels behind
    the EDWC dam during heavy rains by improving internal water flows in the EDWC and
    increasing EDWC drainage relief capacity to the Demerara River. This component allowed
    for additional upgrading of water control structures based on the analytical outputs produced
    in Component 1 and included the following sub-components (from CAP, Annex 3):
               i) Increased discharge capacity of key relief canal form EDWC to Demerara
                    river;
               ii) Improvement of water flow system within EDWC
               iii) Upgrading of water control structures;
               iv) Selected equipment purchase and installation; and
               v) Major infrastructure civil works and operational improvements.

23. The key outcomes of this component include an increased drainage capacity of the EDWC to
    the Demerara River by roughly 35% (with the exact figure to be finalised during the first year
    of implementation), and additional investments made by the GoG, through the NDIA, to
    strengthen the drainage and irrigation infrastructure based on the engineering foundation
    developed under Component 1.

24. Component 3 – Institutional strengthening and project management (US$ 0.1 million
    from GEF). This component was designed to strengthen the institutional framework for flood
    control within the context of the national emergency management sector headed by the Civil
    Defence Commission. The project was designed to also support an institutional consolidation
    of flood control in Guyana to help create consensus around a medium and long term
    intervention strategy to help Guyana adapt to sea level rise. Sub-components include (from
    CAP, Annex 3):
               i) Contingency plan for flood events;
               ii) Institutional Analysis of the Drainage Sector;
               iii) Development of flood control thematic committee (Implementation
                    Secretariat); and
               iv) Donor meeting to be held at project completion.

25. The outcome is to better position the GoG to respond to flood emergencies. The role of the
    Implementation Secretariat was to consolidate flood control work in Guyana, leading to
    greater information sharing and institutional memory throughout the government.

   1.6 Revised Components

26. The 2011 restructuring involved changes in the three components and sub-components that
    modified indicators:

          Component 1 was adjusted so that the capacity building activities originally listed
           under this component were transferred to Component 3.
          Component 2 key outcome and project indicator 3 “increased drainage relief capacity
           of the EDWC to the Demerara River by 35%” was dropped. This affected component
           2.1 – Widening of key drainage relief canals (i.e. Cunha Canal rehabilitation),

                                                 19
    
              withdrawn according to ISR report No.8. The funds of the withdrawn activities were
              transferred to component 1 to cover additional costs of the engineering studies.
             Component 3 activities and indicators related to institutional analysis of drainage
              sector was withdrawn and the scope of the Implementation Secretariat reduced. Some
              funds resulting from these changes were also transferred to component 1.

          1.7 Other significant changes

27. As mentioned previously, the 2011 restructuring included some reallocations:
        Unused funds from components 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 and 3.1 were mainly reallocated to
          component 1 to cover the costs of the engineering studies (see table 1. below).

              Studies for Design of Engineering Works and Supervision of Specific Adaptation
              Works” and (ii) to allow for preparation and completion of a contingency plan that, in
              compliance with the Safety of Dams policy, would serve in case of the emergency

           situation of a breach of East Demerara Water Conservancy. The latter was not
           completed within the project time-frame.

   2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

   2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

29. Soundness of background analysis: The project concept was developed after the
    devastating 2005 flood. The fundamental focus of the project was to reduce flood disaster
    risk. The strategic choices underlying the project design reflect the need to develop a
    technical baseline as a basis for making rational investment decisions. On this basis, the
    project design emphasised understanding the hydrological behaviour of the EDWC and East
    Coast drainage systems, alongside understanding the technical stability of the EDWC dam.
    The pre-investment studies are essential for proper planning and sighting of key investments.

30. The project design was based on recommendations resulting from previous projects (the 1998
    El Nino Emergency Assistance Project P057271 and the 2005 Water Sector Consolidation
    Project P088030) carried out with the Guyana MoA. The following lessons were taken into
    account:
          The project aimed at minimizing procurement delays due to poor response leading to
           re-bidding, higher than estimated bid-costs, inconsistency between bid-evaluation
           reports and recommendations, small pool of able contractors, system deficiencies
           including no penalties for delays or poor quality work, and slow decision making by
           limiting the number of tenders. This was done by bundling all technical tasks under
           one contract, which reduced and optimized procurement timing and processes.
           Overall risk for procurement and financial management was considered moderate at
           appraisal. However, the complexity of the main contract to carry out pre-investment
           studies and the required local technical and administration capacity may have been
           underestimated, resulting in contracting delays.
          The institutional capacity of the country was taken into account by limiting the
           number of contracts in the project, with implementation streamlined and executed by
           international experts. The implementation capacity at the local level and limited
           capacity in procurement and financial management were identified at appraisal as a
           substantial risk.
          Previous attempts to strengthen the capacity of Hydromet (under the 1998 El Niño
           Emergency Assistance Project) were thwarted by high turnover, lack of knowledge
           and poor physical condition of Hydromet’s facilities, therefore the CAP limited its
           assistance to Hydromet to donating hydro-meteorological instrumentation for
           management purposes and training initiatives.

31. Project Design & Quality: The implementation arrangements for the project were aimed at
    maximising cost effectiveness, promoting timely execution and ownership, and ensuring
    transparency amongst stakeholders. This arrangement consisted of:
       ‐   An Implementation Secretariat (IS) responsible for the project oversight and
           coordination. IS included NDIA, CDC, S&RD and L&SC and was consolidated
           through an MoU. Advisory members included the MoF, Ministry of Housing and
           Water, EPA, Hydromet and international donors (observers), with the Minister of
           Agriculture acting as chair and the MoA Permanent Secretary (PS) as deputy

                                                 21
    
                 chairman. The IS was successfully set-up, generally regarded as beneficial but met
                 officially only 4 times. Nevertheless, IS members were involved in all CAP activities
                 including dissemination and training events.
          ‐      The Project Execution Unit (PEU) ASDU, housed within the MoA, was responsible
                 for administrative and fiduciary aspects of the project, including payments to
                 contractors. However, the PEU was not funded directly from the project, so had
                 competing priorities. Moreover, the PEU was not familiar with Bank procedures and
                 specific training was not provided. The overall risk for procurement and financial
                 management was considered moderate during appraisal7 and despite the funding
                 issues, this rating increased to satisfactory near the end of project implementation8.

32. The PDO was and remains highly relevant to WB and GoG development priorities. The CAP
    was not included in the CAS issued May 17, 2002 however the catastrophic floods of 2005
    and 2006 showed the need for intervention and the development of the CAP. The CAS valid
    for 2009-2012 was based in part on the goals and objectives of the CAP.

33. Project components were clearly formulated and well-linked to the PDO. However the
    complexities of the planned structural-investments were underestimated as sub-component
    2.1, the main structural investment identified for the project (i.e. the Cunha Canal
    Rehabilitation), which was to be funded by or through the GoG (according to the PAD), had
    to be dropped following recommendations made in the MTR, which also pointed to the need
    to trigger the Involuntary Resettlement Safeguard should the GoG had decided to keep the
    sub-component. This safeguard could have been triggered as a precautionary measure at
    appraisal.

34. Some project intermediate indicators were not well defined. For example, only coastal areas
    in Region 4 were related to achieving the PDO key indicators, therefore Regions 3 and 5
    should not have been included in indicator 1.1 (as LiDAR data collection over these other
    areas would have involved excessive costs). Furthermore, the indicators related to the
    functioning of the Implementation Secretariat were overly ambitious and not calibrated for
    purpose and the need of the project, as noted in the mid-term review of June, 2010.

35. It is worth noting that a Bank Quality Assessment of Lending Portfolio (QALP-2)9 prepared
    by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG), rated the “Quality of Design” satisfactory overall in
    June, 2010, around the time the mid-term review mission was taken place. (The details of the
    QAG assessment are presented under Bank Performance in Section 5.1).

36. Risk rating: Overall, project risk was deemed Substantial at appraisal. In retrospect, the
    rating seems to have correctly gauged the challenges posed to the project. The substantial
    risks of limited implementation capacity at the local level and capacity in procurement and
    financial management materialised and were partially mitigated by support and
    communication with the WB. Regular, localised flooding events did occur throughout the
    project duration, but major risks were mitigated by continuous GoG maintenance and
    improvements along the EDWC dam wall and repairs to sluices. In particular the project
    found that the new GoG Hope-Dochfour canal, due to become operational early in 2014, will

   significantly lower water levels in the EDWC. Works to further improve the drainage system
   and rehabilitate the EDWC dam are being considered under a Bank funded DRM project,
   complementing JICA (dam wall rehabilitation works) and EU (sea wall retrofitting)
   investments.

   2.2 Implementation

37. For most of its lifespan, project implementation was rated Satisfactory (with some
    Moderately Satisfactory ratings at mid-project).

38. Factors that supported implementation were:
    ‐ Strong GoG commitment to the project. The GoG demonstrated its full commitment to the
       project objectives through financing of for example (i) the new Hope-Dochfour canal
       linking the EDWC with the Atlantic Ocean, and (ii) repair and rehabilitation of the
       EDWC dam and interventions along the East Coast. The CAP financed pontoon and
       excavator, with additional units provided by JICA, have helped the GoG monitor and
       immediately repair weaker sections of the dam, considerably improving dam safety. The
       newly installed hydrometeorological instrumentation and on-line database are used to
       monitor EDWC water-levels on a near-time basis for improved EDWC management.

   ‐   Continuous GoG and WB collaboration. The GoG and the WB collaborated closely
       throughout the project in order to improve implementation performance. The WB
       provided technical and project management support to the GoG when required. At mid-
       term review, the project had made substantial progress in strengthening its financial
       management capacity due to the hiring of additional staff within the PEU. Audit reports
       were unqualified and there were no internal control issues.

   ‐   Continuous GoG engagement with other donors. In particular, other donor projects such
       as those financed through the IDB working with ASDU, helped to build capacity and
       finance the PEU team.

   ‐   Successful contract awards. Despite delays, the project benefitted from limiting the
       number of tenders for the main technical part of the project to one. A further contract for
       quality control and assurance ensured that project deliverables were at a high standard.

39. Several factors however, adversely affected project implementation:
    ‐ A Slow disbursement rate (leading to extensions of the project closing date) was mainly
       due to procurement and other issues:
        Bidding processes were generally lengthy and unsuccessful due to a limited number
          of bids and / or excessive costs which required re-bidding or extension of deadlines.
          The main contract covering engineering studies, which represented more than 60% of
          funds, was awarded almost two years after effectiveness.
        Technical reviews were lengthy due to the highly technical nature of the project.
        The PEU was not familiar with Bank procurement procedures and didn’t receive
          training.
        Initial disbursement arrangements which did not include a Designated Account that
          would have facilitated operational expenses.
        Other secondary effects such as delayed primary data collection in two wet seasons
          and LiDAR data collection in the dry season due to the procurement delays (in
          contracting and procurement of equipment).

                                                 23
    
   2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

40. Monitoring and evaluation was mainstreamed under all project components through: (i)
    contract compliance, (ii) project implementation and (iii) impact monitoring. The PEU
    (ASDU) managed procurement, performance monitoring and acceptance certification. An
    external engineering firm with expertise in water projects, mapping and surveying was
    recruited to monitor and evaluate progress and project results. The Bank worked closely with
    the PEU and retained the services of the engineering firm to follow project implementation
    and review progress reports presented by the main contractor.

   The 2010 Mid-Term Review (MTR) was a turning point in project implementation. The team
   focused on: (i) progress in achieving outcomes; (ii) institutional arrangements for project
   implementation; (iii) effectiveness and suitability of the monitoring system; and (iv) review
   of project implementation plan, disbursement schedule and operation manual. The MTR
   mission recommended to: (i) adhere to the reviewed project implementation schedule, (ii)
   withdraw the Cunha canal rehabilitation works given the uncertainty of funds availability and
   newly identified resettlement issues, (iii) redefine the PDO/GEO and expected indicators
   subject to GoG decision, and (iv) extend the project closing date. Progress towards
   achievement of the Global Environmental Objectives and Implementation Progress was at the
   time rated Moderately Satisfactory. The last ISR (No. 11) dated May 2013 rated both GEO
   and Implementation progress Satisfactory.


   2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

    Safeguard compliance
41. The project is a Category B project. The following safeguards policies were triggered at
    appraisal.
        Environmental assessment (OP/BP/GP 4.01)
        Natural Habitat (OP/BP 4.04)
        Forest (OP/BP 4.36)
        Safety of dams (OP/BP 4.37)

42. Environmental Safeguards
    Environmental requirements for small maintenance works were applied in the form of
    contract clauses.

43. In accordance with the Environmental Implementation Plan (EIP) (from the initial EA), an
    environmental and social assessment of the proposed Cunha Canal works was completed in
    March 2010. The findings were incorporated in the draft construction TORs for the project
    and the GoG advanced on the recommendations in the report with respect to resettlement
    requirements (by preparing a draft resettlement plan). The EA was reviewed by the Bank and
    comments were incorporated into the final document.

44. With respect to Natural Habitat (OP/BP 4.04) and Forest (OP/BP 4.36) safeguards, the
    project did not involve interventions with respect to forests and natural habitats and no such
    activities were contemplated. The project included activities impacting Safety of dams
    (OP/BP 4.37) but these activities related to the assessment of the integrity of the EDWC dam
    and the development of engineering data not physical interventions.

                                                 24
    
45. Social Safeguards
    The triggering of the Involuntary Resettlement safeguard (OP/BP 4.12) was not foreseen
    during the design of the project but the March 2010 EA for the rehabilitation of the Cunha
    Canal indicated that this safeguard was necessary. The safeguard was not triggered however,
    as the rehabilitation of Cunha Canal (component 2.1) was removed from the project because
    of: (i) the complexity of the land-tenure issues related to the Cunha Canal, (ii) the subsequent
    withdrawal of donor funding and related financial uncertainties and (iii) completion of the
    component within the time-frame of the project.

   Fiduciary Compliance

46. No major fiduciary issues requiring Government or Bank attention emerged throughout the
    Project implementation period, as corroborated by audit reports and procurement post-
    reviews.

47. Financial Management. At project closing, the overall Financial Management was rated as
    Satisfactory.

   2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

48. The key indicator of success and sustainability of the project is the follow-on financing to
    climate change-proof the EDWC and other conservancy systems. The CAP generated a
    portfolio of recommended discrete and strategic investments totalling approximately US$ 123
    million (see Table 2. below).

49. The GoG is planning to initially finance CAP follow-up investments totalling US$11.89
    million from the IDA-16 allocation for a Disaster Risk Management Project (P147250, Board
    presentation scheduled May 20, 2014). The works being considered for the project given the
    available financing, involve the reconstruction of part of the EDWC North-East dam,
    identified during CAP as the part of the dam in most need of attention and/or the installation
    of 3 new pumping stations in catchments along the East Coast.

50. Furthermore, the Cunha Canal Rehabilitation project (P132408) for US$ 2.51 million is being
    developed as a stand-alone project through the Guyana REDD+ Investment Fund (GRIF) and
    is scheduled for presentation on April 15, 2014.

51. The CAP was designed in close collaboration with the donor community and is being used by
    the GoG to guide future interventions aimed at minimising flood risk in the EDWC and East
    Coast. A meeting held with the donor community (WB, EU, JICA, and IDB) at project
    completion (January 22, 2014) indicated that there is continued interest from the donor
    community in using the technologies developed during the project for follow-up work (e.g.
    LiDAR and DEM) as well as financing of specific works recommend by the studies.
                                                    26
    
52. The WB is also considering supporting the development of a proposed umbrella Climate
    Resilience Strategy and Action Plan for Guyana project through technical assistance.

53. The results of the CAP are being disseminated and communicated using an ACP-EU Global
    Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GRDRR) Grant (TF013119, Strengthening
    Guyana’s Coastal Land’s Information Systems and Adaptation Awareness) for US$260,000
    with the objective of improving knowledge and awareness of Guyana’s flood control efforts.
    Dissemination activities under the grant have included: the development of a technically
    accurate animation describing the EDWC and East Coast drainage systems for public
    dissemination; a further technical animation aimed at decision makers explaining in a visual
    way the results of the modelling study; and a booklet showcasing the technologies developed
    under the project and various stakeholder workshops. A further dissemination workshop is
    planned for March 2014.

   3. Assessment of Outcomes
   3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

54. The PDO and GEO remain highly relevant and are consistent with the current Bank strategy,
    country strategy (CAS) as well as Guyana’s national development plan, the 2013-2018
    Disaster Risk Management Plan for the Agricultural Sector, and for drainage and irrigation
    master-plan for Region 4 up to 2030.

   3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

55. The original key project development objectives were partially achieved:

       ‐   The project successfully delivered substantive non-structural vulnerability reduction
           measures aiming to reduce Guyana’s vulnerability to catastrophic flooding in the long
           run. The baseline hydrological assessment of the EDWC and East Coast drainage
           areas as well as technical studies identifying follow-up investment strategies and
           designs were fully completed, as originally proposed. The relevance of the pre-
           investment studies is exemplified by the follow on US$123 million of investments
           that has been developed, and that is to be partially financed by IDA, REDD and GRIF
           among others.

       ‐   As indicated above, potential mid-term structural measures originally proposed under
           the project to be financed by or through the GoG, namely the rehabilitation of the
           Cunha Canal, did not materialized, but are to be funded by other sources. Other
           structural measures, such as the upgrading of the flood control structures (i.e.
           complete rehabilitation of the two Lama sluices) were successfully completed and
           selected equipment (i.e. a pontoon barge and excavator) was purchased. These
           directly contributed to reducing flood risk by increasing the drainage capacity of
           EDWC and facilitated the mobilization of equipment to repair critical sections of
           dam, and respond to dam slips and breaches. Additionally, the hydro-meteorological
           instrumentation was purchased and installed enabling real-time management of
           EDWC water-levels, and contributing to the national weather-forecasting program..




                                                 27
    
56. In terms of key PDO indicators:

(i) Indicator 1 – Completed: A hydrologic engineering foundation suitable for
contemplating rational investments aimed at increasing the current discharge capacity of the
flood control system was developed for both the EDWC and East Coast drainage systems
using aerial surveys including LiDAR and aerial photography, ground-truthed using a
network of ground-control benchmarks.
    ‐ Hydrological and hydraulic models were set up, calibrated and verified against
       observed datasets to understand water movement within the EDWC system.
    ‐ Geotechnical studies of the EDWC dam enabled an assessment of its current stability
       and highlighted areas in critical need of repair.
    ‐ An assessment was made of the reliability with which the EDWC can meet the water
       demands placed on it and an operations manual for the EDWC was developed
       including flood management, water resources operation, maintenance and monitoring.
    ‐ An Environmental Assessment was developed for the proposed construction activities
       using EPA guidelines.

(ii) Indicator 2 – Completed: During the project, 11 key drainage regimes for follow-on
intervention were identified and pre-engineering studies for 14 interventions were
completed along Region 4’s East Coast. A multi-criterion analysis (based on frequency of
flooding, rate of dissipation, population, affected agricultural area and
infrastructure/agricultural significance) was used to prioritize and select drainage regimes to
be carried forward to the modelling stage. Pre-engineering studies were also completed for
additional drainage interventions from EDWC into the Demerara River (modifications to the
Kofi canal and internal drainage system) and for the rehabilitation of the EDWC dam.

(iii) Indicator 3 – Dropped at March 2011 Project restructuring

In addition to the above, the project also achieved the following:
    ‐ The results and investments identified under the CAP have contributed to and have
        been incorporated within the GoG drainage and irrigation master-plan for Region 4;
    ‐ Inter-agency coordination at the national level has been strengthened through
        continuous involvement in all aspects of the project, dissemination activities and
        training events;
    ‐ Capacity of GoG personnel related to disaster risk management has improved due to
        training in hydro-met instrumentation installation, monitoring and data usage,
        processing and use of LiDAR datasets, hydrological modelling and dam safety;
    ‐ The national hydro-meteorological network has been improved. Hydro-
        meteorological instrumentation purchased under the project consisted of 8 automatic
        tipping-bucket raingauges, 29 water level sensors and loggers and 1 Acoustic Doppler
        Current Profiler to measure flows. The raingauges and water level sensors include an
        inbuilt telemetry system. Data from the instrumentation is automatically sent via a
        phone signal to an internet data repository where it is available to policy makers,
        planners and conservancy managers on a near-real basis. The instrumentation has
        been handed over to Hydromet and now forms part of the national monitoring system;
    ‐ Improved access to information systems for DRM-related planning due to the
        availability of the new LiDAR and DEM datasets and the new on-line hydro-met
        database; and



                                              28
 
       ‐   Raised awareness of flood risk through Project dissemination activities funded
           through the ACP-EU GFDRR including workshops, animations, brochures and
           publications.

   Please see Annex 2 for summary table of outputs.

    3.3 Efficiency
57. Rating: Satisfactory

58. Project Outcome Impact. The Conservancy Adaptation Project (CAP) had positive impact
    in Guyana and its population, as it has: a) reduced the risk of overflow of EDWC; b) made
    more efficient the operational system of the EDWC; and c) provided tools to the GoG for
    planning and managing climate change events.

59. During appraisal, the economic analysis used a cost effectiveness approach to evaluate
    subprojects in Component 2, and specifically one related to the works of widening of the
    drainage Cunha Canal. This subproject, among 5 alternatives considered, was never
    implemented and was withdrawn from the project and therefore it was not evaluated in this
    analysis. Instead, the economic evaluation for this ICR was carried out for works actually
    implemented.

60. Overflow or dam-breach risk reduction was obtained through the rehabilitation of the two
    Lama sluices, which have enabled the conservancy to drain more water when needed, thereby
    lowering water levels and reducing the pressure upon the dam. Additionally, operation of the
    EDWC improved through the acquisition of equipment, such as: a) a new punt, pontoon and
    excavator that made it easier and faster to access and repair areas of the dam, b) a hydro-
    meteorological monitoring system, which contributes to the management of water levels in
    EDWC on a near real-time basis.


61. Details of the calculations and methodologies employed in the Economic analysis are given
    in full in Annex 3.

62. a) The Avoided Cost Approach for the rehabilitation works and heavy-duty equipment
    involves comparing the costs incurred in the operation of the two sluices, and use of
    equipment for maintenance of the dam before Project implementation and after. For example,
    before rehabilitation, the Lama sluices had to be opened with an excavator, at a higher cost
    and with less reliability than after rehabilitation. Similarly, before the punt and pontoon were
    purchased, in order to carry out repairs to the dam, an excavator was needed to be located,
    hired and brought to the EDWC then transported by pontoon to the relevant site, a procedure
    which could take several days.

63. The results of the analysis show that the savings in operating costs alone are twice as high as
    the costs of rehabilitation and purchase of the heavy-duty equipment and that the return on
    the investments is 29%.

64. Even though the results are satisfactory, the actual benefits of overflow and dam-breach risk
    reduction are huge and go beyond any savings made on operating costs, yet the magnitude of
    the project’s contribution towards risk-reduction could not be quantified. Past events have
    caused severe damages and any risk reduction is significant. The most vulnerable area if

                                                  29
    
   overflow or a dam-breach occurs is the coastal area of Region 4, which has a population of
   about 300 thousand (40% of total population of Guyana).

65. b) Benchmarking Methodology. This approach was used to calculate the potential benefits of
    investing in a hydro-meteorological system, and is based on a study by Hallegatte (2012)10
    using the country’s GDP.

66. When applied to the 2007 GDP of Guyana (US$ 1.7 billion), the results show that the
    likeliest benefit expected in Guyana from hydro-meteorological services is close to US$ 1
    million per year; US$ 59 thousand of those correspond to avoided asset losses, and US$ 870
    thousand correspond to additional economic gains in weather related sectors. Improvement in
    the use of the services could benefit up to US$ 3.7 million if strong management practices
    were adopted.

67. To quantify the net benefits expected from the hydro-meteorological system, the flow of
    annual benefits were projected during the life-time of the system (estimated as 10 years), and
    compared with the flow of costs of the system11 during the same period. The results show that
    net benefits for the low-estimate scenario are almost twice as much as the costs for the hydro-
    meteorological system; and are 16 times higher in the likely scenario. Net benefits are
    between US$ 134 thousand and US$ 4.6 million, with returns from 21% to 293%. If
    additional improvements are achieved, benefits will grow as well.

68. Additional benefits from the CAP: These are associated with strengthening of the GoG for
    planning and managing flood risk, which will give assurance to sustainability of future
    interventions. Moreover, the engineering studies financed under the project will allow GoG
    prioritizes investment in critical areas and coordinate the use of funds that may become
    available from donors. These studies generated a portfolio of investments amounting US$123
    million, including drainage interventions on the East Coast for a 1:50 year event and for the
    EDWC dam for a 1:10,000 year event.

    3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
69. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

70. The outcome rating reflects the satisfactory and moderately satisfactory ratings of the
    assessment of progress towards PDO achievement in the ISR reports. The project design and
    objectives remained highly relevant during project implementation. Most of the project
    indicators were achieved or partially achieved. This is reflected in the development of a
    hydrologic engineering foundation and the identification and recommendation of 14 most-
    effective engineering works to be carried out within 11 key drainage regimes along the East
    Coast, within the EDWC drainage system itself and recommendations and designs for EDWC
    dam rehabilitation. Despite the withdrawal of a GEO indicator that implied the cancellation
    of related intermediate outcome indicators, the results of the project are contributing to the
    GoG drainage and irrigation master-plan for Region 4 that contains at least 40% of the
    population and the capital city of Georgetown. Recommendations and designs are helping

   institutions.

   3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

    (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
71. The project’s main results involve the development of a technical engineering foundation for
    reducing the risk of flooding in Guyana’s low lying coastal area. As such, it has limited direct
    impacts on poverty, gender and social developments, but the medium and long term impacts
    on all of these sectors will be significant due to the follow-up projects (such as DRM and
    Cunha Canal Rehabilitation Projects). Since disasters affect the poor disproportionally,
    follow-up projects will contribute to the increased resilience of these more vulnerable
    substrata within the general population and will benefit both men and women equally for the
    reduction of flood risk.

    (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
72. The project contributed to institutional capacity-building through training workshops (in the
    use of hydro-monitoring instrumentation, modelling, data acquisition and storage, use of
    LiDAR data, etc.) and fostered inter-agency co-operation and communication, initially
    through the formation of the Implementation Secretariat and then through targeted workshops
    and meetings.

    (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
73. The project helped to promote GoG drainage and irrigation sector activities and raise
    awareness of the functioning of the EDWC system through a complementary project, the
    US$260,000 ACP-EU GFDRR grant (TF013119), which funded the communication
    activities of the project. Two short visually accurate animations, one for a general audience
    introducing the EDWC, and a one for policy makers to visually communicate the results of
    the project are being developed under the grant. In addition, a booklet showcasing the
    techniques applied in the project was developed, and various stakeholder workshops and
    public dissemination activities are in progress.

74. The LiDAR data is being used by the GoG for various other purposes (e.g. development and
    planning) and there is interest in replicating the technologies used within the project for other
    conservancies around Guyana. Further workshops on the use and application of LiDAR data
    are being planned with the GoG under the GFDRR grant. There is government interest in
    developing a data-storage and data-sharing platform (such as GeoNode) to make data such as
    the LiDAR and DEMs developed within the project, easily available to government agencies
    and other interested parties. The DEM produced by the project will be useful in many
    applications, including as a basis for further modelling studies, line of sight studies, biomass
    measurements, 3D building-modelling, further climate change impact studies and
    visualisations, and land-use planning.

75. The hydro-monitoring instrumentation has been incorporated within the national hydro-
    monitoring network. The availability of near real-time data sets are helping the GoG monitor
    water levels in the conservancy for management purposes and indicate areas where dredging
    of channels is required.

76. The excavator and pontoon bought under the project have been used in the Conservancy for
    emergency repairs and for other works and has a beneficial impact.

    3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
77. On Jan 22, 2014, a meeting was held in the MoA with representatives of MoA, MoF, NDIA,
    ASDU and WB to present and discuss the findings of this ICR and the comments received
    have been incorporated into this report. The participants commented on various sections of
    the report. Overall, participants found the meeting useful for reviewing project
    implementation progress and felt the lessons learned could be incorporated into new project
    designs (DRM and Cunha rehabilitation projects). Please refer to Annex 6 for details.

    4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
78. Rating: Moderate

79. The GoG has demonstrated a strong commitment to improving flood risk within the most
    populated coastal areas. Examples in the EDWC include (i) the development of the new
    Hope-Dochfour canal (ii) the rehabilitation of sections of dam, and (iii) securing additional
    donor funding (JICA) for excavation equipment and sluice rehabilitation. The CAP
    recommended engineering works to improve drainage in the EDWC and East Coast of the
    project are already being incorporated in follow-up activities (DRM and Cunha Canal
    Rehabilitation Projects) and are helping to shape the upcoming GoG comprehensive Drainage
    and Irrigation Masterplan Plan. However, there is a possibility that the implementation of the
    proposed investments and the identification of funding may not take place in a timely
    manner. There is also the possibility that during the implementation of follow-up activities,
    new floods could divert government attention from the need to formulate and/or implement a
    longer term strategic flood control plan.

80. Based on the above and taking into account the operational, sector and country context, the
    likelihood that changes may negatively affect the development outcome of the CAP are
    considered moderate.

   5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

   5.1 Bank Performance

    (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
81. Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

82. The CAP project design reflects both innovation and effective response to client needs. It was
    designed to finance a combination of non-structural and structural measures aiming are
    reducing the country’s vulnerability to flooding. The Project design was focused on the
    development of a long-term comprehensive set of analytical tools that were needed for the
    design of a comprehensive flood management program for the coastal lowland drainage
    system, and on a lesser scale on few medium-term rehabilitation works and operational
    improvements aimed at enhancing the flood control capacity of the EDWC. There was a
    close and continued collaboration between the WB and the GoG as well as the donor
    community during project preparation.

83. The project objective remains relevant. However, given the context, difficulties during
    implementation and the need for project restructuring to withdraw key activities, lead to
    conclude that the project objective was overambitious. Indicators were adequate but needed
    to be adjusted to reflect these changes.


                                                 32
    
84. The above would call for a Satisfactory rating. However, the rating also takes into account
    the following:
        ‐ The core of the Project was designed with non-structural risk reduction activities. The
            envisioned interventions12 of widening of key drainage relief canals such as the Kofi
            Canal, which operated under-capacity due to restrictions caused by sedimentation and
            vegetation growth and possibly widening of the Cunha Canal, were based on
            feasibility and availability of funds. A more in-depth assessment of the potential
            structural measures being considered would have likely resulted in the precautionary
            triggering of the Involuntary Resettlement Safeguard (OP/BP 4.12), during the
            preparation stage of the project;
        ‐ A more realistic assessment of the incremental staffing and training that would be
            required could have facilitated implementation.
        ‐ The modelling studies and technologies that were ultimately financed under the
            project were highly sophisticated and required advanced technical expertise. The
            project ultimately completed the technical studies that were necessary and delivered
            the proposed results, greatly strengthening the capacity of counterpart agencies.
            However, the technical level of support that was required was much higher than
            originally envisioned.
        ‐ Project implementation could have been more efficient if arrangements had been
            made to directly finance technical, financial and administrative staff to be devoted to
            the project.
        ‐ As indicated previously (2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry), some
            project intermediate indicators were not well defined (only Region 4 was related to
            PDO) or overly ambitious (the Implementation Secretariat did not function as
            expected).

85. In June 2010, QAG’s assessment rated the project quality of design as satisfactory overall.
    The report indicates that the team did a very good diagnostic analysis in identifying the main
    weaknesses in past flood control practices and identified clearly that a systems approach was
    needed to replace the existing water management practice. According to QAG, the team also
    correctly noted that a thorough planning study and systems modelling were necessary.
    However, the assessment also found that the design was less than satisfactory in the
    development objectives, which were too broadly defined, and in the results framework, which
    lacked baseline data. These weaknesses later showed to impact the implementation of the
    project.

    (b) Quality of Supervision
86. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

87. The rating reflects recognition that supervision missions were generally both timely and
    solution-oriented, and that the Bank team closely supported the GoG throughout
    implementation. There was at least one supervision mission per year and supporting grant
    was mobilized for communications. The 2011 restructuring adequately addressed all the
    issues that were identified in the Mid-term Review; and the project was extended to allow the
    completion of the engineering studies.

88. The rating also reflects the technical and administrative limitations experienced in the project
    causing delays in the hiring process. These may have been mitigated by providing
                                                               
   12
        As described in the CAP, Annex 16 GEF STAP Review and other sections of the PAD.

                                                                  33
    
   uninterrupted technical supervision of the main engineering studies and timely procurement
   training.

89. In June 2010, QAG’s assessment rated the project quality of Bank supervision satisfactory
    overall. The report reads “the Bank team has been very focused on the need for effective
    strategic planning as key to sustainability of the water management system and the prospect
    of avoiding floods”. The report also mentions that the aide memoirs provided clear and
    candid reporting of the main issues, which were also well summarized in the ISRs. The report
    found less consistency between ISRs’ supervision reporting and certain ratings and sub-
    ratings, “in particular in FY08 and FY09 when the task team was a year late in signalling an
    MS rating for implementation status”.

    (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
90. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

91. The overall rating takes into account the WB moderately unsatisfactory performance in
    ensuring quality at entry and moderately satisfactory quality of supervision.

    5.2 Borrower Performance
    (a) Government Performance
92. Rating: Satisfactory

93. The rating is based on consideration of MoF’s sustained commitment to the project and PDO
    achievement. The GoG, mainly through MoF and MoA, consistently supported the project
    implementation and dissemination of results, and has requested and supported the
    development of follow-on projects.

    (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
94. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

95. The rating reflects the performance and commitment of the PEU to achievement of the PDO.
    The PEU was involved in all aspects of the project including stakeholder consultations.
    Despite initial staffing and financial management computing issues (due to the project not
    directly funding the unit), and slow disbursement level (due to procurement delays), the
    project financial management at closing and implementation progress were rated
    Satisfactory13. The continued support of the implementing agencies towards successful
    delivery of the project is evidenced by the partial achievement of the original PDO/GEO and
    the preparation of follow-up projects.

    (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
96. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

97. The overall borrower performance rating is based on a combination of GoG and
    implementing agency moderately satisfactory performance.

   6. Lessons Learned

98. There are several lessons to be learned from the CAP as described below.

   Project design: (i) It is recommended that all future projects enable the use of a Designated
   Account as a mode of disbursement and budget should be made available to directly fund
   staff under the project; (ii) a detailed procurement plan should be established at appraisal for
   all key components of the project, especially those that directly impact the timing of other
   project components (such as equipment purchase, key contracts); (iii) TOR specifications
   should incorporate close and continued technical supervision to avoid delays and/or
   misunderstandings; and (iv) technical review of the project should run throughout project
   implementation and include aspects for quality control.

   Contract awards: Use of a single contract award, to implement large parts of the project,
   facilitated implementation and ensured consistency across deliverables.

   Training: Provisions for continuous training, practice and supervision (e.g. data acquisition,
   hydrological modelling, GIS) should be incorporated throughout the life-span of the project
   minimising the use of one-off workshops or training events.

   Communication: The CAP communication plan was funded by a GFDRR grant. It was
   found that this helped to regularly disseminate the results of the project, facilitate knowledge
   transfer, boost coordination and inform future activities. It is highly recommended that all
   future projects incorporate a communication/dissemination plan.

   Technical baseline: The remote sensing technologies and modelling methods used in the
   project have been tested in the CAP, and can be replicated for other regions in Guyana or in
   other Caribbean countries with similar situations. Development of a technical foundation for
   risk analysis conducive to rationalising key-investment strategies is a necessary step in
   reducing flood risk.

       7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

   The GoG participated in a meeting to discuss the ICR report in January 2014 (see section 3.6
   and Annex 6) and their comments have been included in this ICR report. The GoG has
   reviewed this report and have no further comments.

Annex 3. Economic Analysis

Project Outcome Impact: The Conservancy Adaptation Project (CAP) had a positive impact
in Guyana and its population, as it has: a) reduced the risk of overflow or dam breach of
EDWC; b) made more efficient the operational system of the EDWC; and c) provided tools
to the GoG for planning and managing climate change events.

Overflow or dam-breach risk reduction was obtained through the rehabilitation of the two
Lama sluices, which have enabled the conservancy to drain more water when needed, thereby
lowering water levels and reducing the pressure upon the dam. Additionally, operation of the
EDWC improved through the acquisition of equipment, such as: a) a new punt, pontoon and
excavator that made it easier and faster to access and repair areas of the dam, b) a hydro-
meteorological monitoring system, which contributes to the management of water levels in
EDWC on a near real-time basis.

The economic evaluation for this ICR was carried out for works actually implemented under
the project and therefore does not include the rehabilitation of the Cunha Canal under
Component 2.1, which was withdrawn following MTR. The two methodologies used for this
evaluation are: a) the “avoided cost approach” for both the rehabilitation works (i.e. the
rehabilitation of the two Lama Sluices) and the heavy-duty equipment purchased (i.e.
excavator, punt and pontoon); and b) the “benchmarking approach” for the hydro-
meteorological system. For other activities, such as the technical and modelling studies, the
benefits are qualified, but not quantified

a) The Avoided Cost Approach for the rehabilitation works and heavy-duty equipment
involves comparing the costs incurred in the operation of the two sluices, and use of
equipment for maintenance of the dam before Project implementation and after. For example,
before rehabilitation, the Lama sluices had to be opened with an excavator, at a higher cost
and with less reliability than after rehabilitation. Similarly, before the punt and pontoon were
purchased, in order to carry out repairs to the dam, an excavator was needed to be located,
hired and brought to the EDWC then transported by pontoon to the relevant site, a procedure
which could take several days.

The costs associated with those practices were estimated as follows:
     a) excavator hire: GD$ 10,000/hour;
     b) excavator operator: GD$ 5,000/day;
     c) mobilization costs: GD$ 500,000;
     d) contractor’s pontoon/barge; GD$ 75,000; and
     e) 30% for supervision, fuel, and others.

The excavator required a minimum of three days hire: a day to mobilize it, a day to work with
it; and a third day to demobilize. The whole operation is therefore valued at around GD$ 2
million, or US$10,000. According to information provided by the operators of the EDWC, it
was normal procedure during the raining season to hire at least two excavators at least 6 times
per year, or more, depending on the severity of the rains. For this evaluation, the cost was
estimated based on the normal use of 6 times per year and costs for the rehabilitation of the
sluices and purchase of the heavy-duty equipment included an additional 2% operating costs.
All costs were transformed to 2007 prices.



                                              40
 
The results show that the savings in operating costs alone are twice as high as the costs of
rehabilitation and purchase of the heavy-duty equipment and that the return on the
investments is 29% (see Table i).

Even though the results are satisfactory, the actual benefits that come along with overflow
and dam-breach risk reduction are huge and go beyond any savings made on operating costs,
yet the magnitude of the project’s contribution towards risk-reduction could not be
quantified. Past events have caused severe damages and any risk reduction is significant. The
most vulnerable area if overflow or a dam-breach occurs is the coastal area of Region 4,
which has a population of about 300 thousand (40% of total population of Guyana). Past
events that have caused flooding and overflowing of the EDWC dam which have created
significant damages to the population. Heavy rains occurred in January-February 2005 which,
according to the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC),
affected 37% of the total population and caused damages worth US$ 465 million, or 59
percent of Guyana’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP)14. Damages were the result of flooding
due to above average rainfall and overtopping in some areas of the EDWC dam. In lowland
areas, floodwaters persisted for nearly a month and the death toll reached 34, of which 27
were due to water borne diseases. One year later, floods caused by rainfall during December
2005-February 2006, generated further damages worth US$ 30 million according to
ECLAC15.

b) Benchmarking Methodology. This approach was used to calculate the potential benefits of
investing in a hydro-meteorological system, and is based on a study by Hallegatte (2012)16
using the country’s GDP. The study’s results show that the total potential benefits from
upgrading the hydro-meteorological data system and early-warning capacities of developing
countries to developed countries standards include: (i) between US$ 300 million and 2 billion

per year of avoided asset losses due to natural disasters; (ii) an average of 23,000 saved lives
per year, which is valued between US$ 700 million and 3.5 billion per year using the
Copenhagen Consensus guidelines; and (iii) between US$ 3 and 30 billion per year of
additional economic benefits.

The methodology states that to achieve the assumed benefits, investments would be required
in: (1) local observation systems; (2) local forecast capacity; (3) increased capacity to
interpret forecasts and translate them into warnings; (4) communication tools to distribute and
disseminate information, data, and warnings; and (5) institutional capacity building and
increased decision-making capacity by the users of warnings and hydro-meteorological
information. The CAP provided the platform for future improvement and investments in all
of these critical areas.

Hallegate estimated benefits from early warning and preparation measures in three
categories: a) reduction of asset losses; b) reduction of human losses; and c) other economic
benefits such as productivity enhancements.

    a) Reduction of asset losses: The study found that a well-functioning (European-like),
       modern early warning system reduces disaster-related asset losses by between 0.003%
       and 0.017% of GDP.

    b) Reduction of human losses: Not applicable here as this evaluation did not include the
       benefit of reducing the loss of human lives, due to lack of information

    c) Other economic benefits. The study found that hydro-meteorological services adds
       gains between 0.1 and 1% in weather-sensitive sectors, which would be
       approximately equal to between 0.025 and 0.0025% of GDP in European-like
       countries.

The study found that developing countries do not operate or respond to the hydro-
meteorological services the same way as European Countries, and so the expected benefits
are lower. The share of losses actually avoided depends on the income level of the country, as
follows: i) for low-income countries only 10% of the benefits are achieved; ii) for lower
middle income countries; 20% of the benefits are achieved; iii) for upper middle income,
50% of the benefits are achieved; and iv) for high income countries 100% of benefits are
achieved. In the case of Guyana, as a lower middle country, 20% of the benefits are expected
as a realistic scenario. If Guyana improves the use of these tools making them fully
operational and population responds to the weather information as directed by the weather
agencies, benefits could increase until they reach European-like countries. The room for
additional benefits is significant as shown in Table ii. The likeliest benefit for European-like
countries for reducing asset losses and from other economic gains is about 0.27% of the
GDP; while in a lower middle country as Guyana is expected to be 0.05%.

      The actual benefits expected for Guyana are estimated as 20% of benefits for European-
    like Countries.

When these percentages are applied to the 2007 GDP of Guyana (US$ 1.7 billion), results
show that the likeliest benefit expected in Guyana from hydro-meteorological services is
close to US$ 1 million per year; US$ 59 thousand of those correspond to avoided asset losses,
and US$ 870 thousand correspond to additional economic gains in weather related sectors.
Improvement in the use of the services could add benefit up to US$ 3.7 million if strong
management practices were adopted (Table iii).

To quantify the net benefits expected from the hydro-meteorological system, the flow of
annual benefits were projected during the life-time of the system (estimated as 10 years), and
compared with the flow of costs of the system17 during the same period. The results show that
net benefits for the low-estimate scenario are almost twice as much as the costs for the hydro-
meteorological system; and are 16 times higher in the likely scenario. Net benefits are

Additional benefits from the CAP: These are associated with strengthening of the GoG for
planning and managing flood risk, which will give assurance to sustainability of future
interventions. Moreover, the engineering studies financed under the project will allow GoG
prioritizes investment in critical areas and coordinate the use of funds that may become
available from donors. These studies generated a portfolio of investments amounting US$123
million, including drainage interventions on the East Coast for a 1:50 year event and for the
EDWC dam for a 1:10,000 year event.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

A stakeholder workshop was held in Georgetown, Guyana on Jan 21, 2014 at the Ministry of
Agriculture to discuss the findings of the ICR.

A total of 14 participants were involved:
    ‐ 5 WB staff
    ‐ 3 MoA
    ‐ 2 MoF
    ‐ 3 NDIA
    ‐ 2 ASDU

By means of introduction, participants were shown a 5 minute animation produced under the
ACP-EU GFDRR grant, introducing the EDWC, which was well received. A presentation
was then given on the proposed contents of the various sections of the ICR report. Each
section of the report was discussed and comments made are noted below.

The ICR findings were well received. In addition, some points were raised during the meeting
as follows:
    (i)     Indicators: The original project design was larger in scope and aimed to collect
            LiDAR data over Regions 3, 4 and 5, but the budget restricted LiDAR coverage to
            the coastal areas of Region 4 where most of the population lives. The project
            intermediate indicators 1.1 and 1.2 should therefore have been altered to reflect
            these changes. Despite the problem with the indicators, it was felt that the LiDAR
            data adequately covered the area of interest.
    (ii)    Training: It was felt that additional training both on the use of LiDAR data and in
            hydrological modelling would be beneficial and necessary for future planning
            purposes. The LiDAR training to be carried out under GRDRR grant was
            welcome and the incorporation of a soft component in the planned DRM project
            was discussed.
    (iii)   EPP: As the Emergency Preparedness Plan (EPP) relating to the EDWC was not
            completed within the project timeframe, there was interest in including this
            component in the planned DRM project.
    (iv)    Operational Capacity: The point was made that the PEU would have functioned
            better with direct resources made available from the project.
    (v)     Consultancy contract: Additionally, with hind-sight, it would have been
            beneficial to secure the availability of the Quality Assurance / Quality Control /
            LiDAR and Geodesy Support consultant throughout out project implementation.
    (vi)    Consultancy contract: PEU payments to the main contractor were initially to be
            based on deliverables not progress reports, but this was not accurately reflected
            and resulted in modifications having to be made to the contract at a later stage.
    (vii) Contract management: It was mentioned that contract management needs to be
            planned well upfront to ensure there are no delays within project implementation.

    The participants comments made during the meeting have been incorporated into this
    report.
