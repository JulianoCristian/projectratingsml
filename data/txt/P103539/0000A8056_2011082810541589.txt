                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the CAP is to reduce the vulnerability of catastrophic flooding in Guyana's low-lying coastal area that is currently threatened by sea level rise
                         resulting from global climate change.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         As of the last ISR, implementation progress was slow, with less than 20% of grant disbursed, largely due to the inability to award the main contract of the grant (amounting to 70% of
                         the total project grant). Since that time the project has witnessed an improvement in the implementation. 90% of the grant resources have been contracted, including the major
                         contract under the grant (awarded in March), and this provided the basis for the extension of the project to March 31, 2013 in order to complete these activities. Since signing,
                         progress under the main contract has been on schedule with the aerial photography and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging, the technology used for mapping topography) data
                         collection now completed. Disbursement for the project overall is now at 38%.
