                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the CAP is to reduce the vulnerability of catastrophic flooding in Guyana's low-lying coastal area that is currently threatened by sea level rise resulting
                         from global climate change.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project's closing has been extended from March 31, 2013 to August 30, 2013 through a formal Level II restructuring approved by the Vice-President. This extension would allow
                         the completion of Component 1 - Pre-Investment Studies for Engineering Design of Works, the completion of quality assurance of the results of the studies, and the finalization of the
                         Emergency Preparedness Plan. The Project has been disbursing well, with disbursements at 71% as of April 3, 2013. Results of the hydrologic model have been presented and
                         undergoing quality control and a preliminary set of investments have been identified and are under discussion.
