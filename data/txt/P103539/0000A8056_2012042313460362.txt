                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the CAP is to reduce the vulnerability of catastrophic flooding in Guyana's low-lying coastal area that iscurrently threatened by sea level rise resulting
                         from global climate change.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project has been disbursing well, with disbursements at 46% as of March 27, 2012. Progress under the grant's main contract has been advancing on schedule. Furthermore, the
                         Government of Guyana has identified funding for the Cunha Canal works, and has requested that the co-financing for these works be provided through the Guyana REDD+
                         Investment Fund (GRIF) with the World Bank as the Partner Entity. The Bank team in collaboration with the GoG has prepared a Project Concept Note for this co-financing, which as
                         part of the GRIF processing procedures has been posted for public comment. The Project Concept Note is pending submission to the GRIF Steering Committee.
