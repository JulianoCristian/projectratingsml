                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the CAP is to reduce the vulnerability of catastrophic flooding in Guyana's low-lying coastal area that iscurrently threatened by sea level rise resulting
                         from global climate change.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?
