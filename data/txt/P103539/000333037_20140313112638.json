moderately satisfactory, the risk to global environment\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: it\n            is recommended that all future projects enable the use of a\n            designated account as a mode of disbursement and budget\n            should be made available to directly fund staff under the\n            project; (ii) a detailed procurement plan should be\n            established at appraisal for all key components of the\n            project, especially those that directly impact the timing of\n            other project components (such as equipment purchase, key\n            contracts); (iii) Terms of Reference, or TOR specifications\n            should incorporate close and continued technical supervision\n            to avoid delays and/or misunderstandings; and (iv) technical\n            review of the project should run throughout project\n            implementation and include aspects for quality control. The\n            CAP communication plan was funded by a Global Facility for\n            Disaster Reduction and Recovery, or GFDRR grant. It was\n            found that this helped to regularly disseminate the results\n            of the project, facilitate knowledge transfer, boost\n            coordination and inform future activities. It is highly\n            recommended that all future projects incorporate a\n            communication/dissemination plan. The remote sensing\n            technologies and modelling methods used in the project have\n            been tested in the CAP, and can be replicated for other\n            regions in Guyana or in other Caribbean countries with\n            similar situations. Development of a technical foundation\n            for risk analysis conducive to rationalizing key-investment\n            strategies is a necessary step in reducing flood risk."}, "docdt": "2014-03-07T00:00:00Z"}
