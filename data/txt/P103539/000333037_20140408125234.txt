 Over 1 m of rain fell in January 2005,
 nearly 5 times the normal amount, with
 65 cm in just 5 days (an estimated return
 period of 1000 years).
 The extreme rainfall caused widespread
 flooding which affected almost half of
 Guyana’s population.
 Total damages from the disaster are
 estimated to have been US$ 465 million
 or 59% of Guyana’s GDP for 2004.
