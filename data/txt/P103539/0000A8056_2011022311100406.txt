                         The objective of the CAP is to reduce the vulnerability of catastrophic flooding in Guyana's low-lying coastal area that is currently threatened by sea level rise
                         resulting from global climate change.

                         investment study for engineering design works (US$2 million out of US$3.8 million) has not started yet. The bidding process was canceled in 2009 due to the fact that there was no
                         successful bidder. A new bidding process was launched in 2010, negotiations started in October and the government is in the final stages of awarding the contract.
