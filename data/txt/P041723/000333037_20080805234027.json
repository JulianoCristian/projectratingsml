PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the National Rural\n            Infrastructure Project in Support of the First Phase of the\n            National Rural Infrastructure Program for Mali were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was modest, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            effective implementation of reforms required a realistic\n            timeline to build capacity, consensus, and government\n            commitment. This process, which often takes more time than\n            expected, requires continuous policy dialogue. The\n            public-private partnership established for the new\n            irrigation financing mechanism is a good method of\n            increasing the area developed for irrigated agriculture.\n            This model should be extended to various actors in a more\n            cohesive manner. National Rural Infrastructure Project\n            (PNIR) investments should serve as a means of piloting a new\n            agricultural development model, characterized by new\n            modalities of access to land and water that will ultimately\n            make it possible to create an official market for land and\n            permit co financing of land settlement by beneficiaries. The\n            pilot undertaken for the project has demonstrated that, to\n            be effective, the package transferred to the private\n            producer must include completely finished plots (that is,\n            plots in which tertiary canals exist) as well as access to\n            credit, inputs, and extension advice. In addition, the study\n            of the irrigation funding mechanism and the pilot in\n            Koumouna showed that the Malian banking system is prepared\n            to finance land development when appropriate procedures are\n            in place and producers have clear title to their land.\n            However, this approach needs to be monitored and its impact\n            assessed with respect to: (i) the feasibility of collecting\n            the property tax on privatized land; and (ii) the risk of\n            land speculation and land ownership by a minority of people,\n            which will contradict the objective of reinforcing direct\n            farming by family businesses."}, "docdt": "2008-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
