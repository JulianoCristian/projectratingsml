There are major environmental and\n            social impacts concerning irrigation development,\n            particularly small-scale irrigation, rural road repair, and\n            rural water supply and sanitation. To offset some of the\n            expected negative impacts, regulatory actions, studies, and\n            actions are recommended. These include: strengthening the\n            ministry in charge of the environment, creating a\n            consultative forum of all concerned parties, setting up a\n            panel of experts, updating the environmental and social\n            clauses in contracts so as to comply with construction\n            guidelines, collaborating with local populations, providing\n            STD and HIV/AIDS awareness training, providing incentives\n            for gender participation, and including vulnerable groups.\n            Other proposals included conducting a drainage system study,\n            surveying soil salinity, addressing woodland depletion,\n            elaborating a water resource study, recommending a\n            groundwater management system, assessing the damage and\n            control of the water hyacinth and other aquatic pests,\n            managing excessive livestock numbers and their overgrazing\n            as well as the rights of herders within the irrigation area,\n            preparing a participatory relocation plan and analysis of\n            the different social groups affected."}, "docdt": "2000-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
