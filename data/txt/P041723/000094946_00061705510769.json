PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The National Rural Infrastructure\n            Program Project for Mali aims to reduce poverty and improve\n            the livelihood of the rural population by accelerating the\n            provision, and enhancing the sustainability, of basic rural\n            infrastructure in irrigation and transport; output markets\n            and social services; and water supply and sanitation. The\n            project has two 5-year phases and is supported through an\n            Adaptable Program Loan (APL). The project has five main\n            components in the first phase. The first component pilots a\n            capital cost recovery mechanism; promotes private irrigation\n            investments on large-scale schemes; improves irrigation\n            infrastructure management; and promotes cost reduction by\n            strengthening local private sector/nongovernmental\n            organizational capacity. The second component sets up an\n            autonomously managed road authority to conduct routine\n            maintenance on the main network and feeder roads; and\n            elaborates a national rural transport strategy. The third\n            component helps construct water supply and sanitation\n            facilities and provides community education activities. It\n            also provides training to construct on-site sanitation\n            systems for households, schools, and health centers; and\n            improves sanitation conditions and hygienic practices. The\n            capacity-building sub-component supports local governments,\n            private sector/NGO providers, and public sector agencies.\n            The fourth component implements environmental action plans.\n            The fifth component sets up the agency for rural works and\n            equipment (AGETIER)."}, "docdt": "2000-06-02T00:00:00Z"}
