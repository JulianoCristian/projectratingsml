The loan and grant agreements were\n            signed on August 4, 1997. However, the project did not\n            become effective as the financial and economic crisis that\n            hit the country in 1997 caused the project to be no longer\n            viable. Consequently, the loan and grant agreement were\n            terminated on July 15, 1998, the effectiveness deadline."}, "docdt": "2004-10-12T00:00:00Z"}
