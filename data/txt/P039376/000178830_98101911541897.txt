OZONE DEPLETING SUBSTANCE PHASE-OUT PROJECT
I. COUNTRY/SECTOR BACKGROUND
1.   The Montreal Protocol is an international agreement to reduce the consumption of
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons that deplete the ozone layer. The Protocol was
adopted in September 1987 and has been ratified by 128 countries marking the first occasion
in which developed and developing countries have agreed on a global strategy to address
a shared environmental problem. The Montreal Protocol was amended in London (June
1990) and Copenhagen (November 1992) which requires the phase-out of additional
substances' that deplete the ozone layer. Countries signatory to the Protocol and its
amendments have agreed to and are taking significant steps in phasing-out the use of ODS
which is commonly used in refrigerator and air conditioner manufacturing, foam production,
and as solvents for industrial washing.
2.    Bulgaria ratified the Montreal Protocol in October 1989 and is committed to meet
the Protocol's requirement of phasing out CFCs, which accounts for 90% of the ODS
consumption in the country, by January 1996. Montreal Protocol considers consumption
as production, exports, and imports. Since Bulgaria does not produce or export CFCs,
restricting CFC imports will allow the country to comply with Montreal Protocol
requirements. To this effect, enterprises using CFCs have prepared sub-projects for
technology conversion that will allow the use of non-CFC substances. However, due to lack
of resources in the current Bulgarian transitional economy enterprises have not yet been
able to implement their sub-projects. Thus, the Government of Bulgaria has requested the
Global Environment Facility (GEF) to finance investments for the technology conversion
and technical assistance. Although Bulgaria remains committed to meet the ODS phase-out
deadline, it is not realistic to expect that all enterprises will be able to convert their
technology on time. Bulgaria, along with other Eastern European countries in a similar
situation, is expected to request the Montreal Protocol Executive Committee (MPEC) for
an extension in the phase-out schedule. Given Bulgaria's pro-active role in ODS phase-out
activities, it is quite likely that the MPEC will grant the extension.
3.   The annual halon consumption has already been minimized to 2 tons and Bulgaria,
like other countries, plans to achieve a zero halon consumption level when effective non-
halon technology in fire fighting equipment is developed. Although Bulgaria is not a
signatory to the London and Copenhagen amendments and as a result not required to
phase-out the chemicals included in the amendments, it is also making long-term plans to
phase-out these chemicals. The priority, however, remains in the phase-out of CFCs which
is the focus of this project.

4.   Bulgaria is currently sharing many of the problems common to the economies in
transition. Per capita GDP declined about 50% between 1989 and 1994, and the industrial
sector's contribution to the GDP dropped from 51% in 1990 to 35% in 1993. Due to the
decline in the industrial sector where most enterprises are not running at full capacity, the
CFC consumption has had a dramatic drop of 80% between 1989 and 1994. The drop in
the consumption is also attributed to the technology conversion that has already taken place
in the non-pharmaceutical aerosol and flexible foam sub-sectors to non-CFC alternatives.
In 1994, the CFC consumption in Bulgaria was 487 tons of which 50 tons were used in the
essential pharmaceutical aerosol sector that has no phase-out schedule as per the Montreal
Protocol. The remaining 437 tons of CFCs were used in refrigeration servicing (100 tons),
refrigeration manufacturing (105 tons), refrigeration foams (73 tons), polyurethene foams
(36 tons), and solvents (123 tons).
II. ODS PHASE-OUT STRATEGY
5.    Bulgaria with bilateral assistance from the Government of Denmark prepared a
Country Program that outlines the ODS consumption pattern and presents a phase-out
strategy that includes key policy actions and investments that would substantially reduce the
ODS consumption. The Country Program has received wide support from various
Ministries, including Ministries of Environment, Finance, and Industry, the Customs
Department, the participating enterprises, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
The phase-out strategy has been reiterated as a Government objective in Bulgaria's
Environmental Strategy Study2. The Government has created an Ozone Task Force (OTF)
in the Ministry of Environment (MOE) to develop, implement, and monitor the phase-out
program. Key elements of the phase-out strategy are highlighted below:
imposing sector specific ban on ODS consumption where non-ODS technology is
proven and commercially available. For example, the ODS consumption in the
refrigeration, foam, and solvent sectors will be banned while in the pharmaceutical
aerosol sector the ban will be imposed after a suitable alternative to CFC use is
available;
developing an ODS license system, as in European Union, to control and monitor
imports and use in the country. Licenses would be issued to importers, end-users,
and refrigeration servicing enterprises;
identifying enterprise needs to convert to non-ODS technology, developing sector
specific action plans for a timely phase-out, and providing technical assistance in
preparing sub-projects for technology conversion;
requesting Global Environment Facility to finance the incremental costs of
technology conversion for key sub-projects that would substantially reduce the ODS
consumption; and
2J Environmental Strategy Study - Update and Follow-Up, Gray Cover Report, December 30, 1994.



developing enforcement mechanisms with a system of fines and regular enterprise
inspection to ensure compliance as per the Montreal Protocol guidelines.
III. PROJECT OBJECTIVE
6.    The objective of the project is to assist Bulgaria's transition into non-CFC technology
as required under the Montreal Protocol. The project will help Bulgaria reach its objective
by: a) supporting priority sub-projects, identified in the Country Program, for technology
conversion to non-CFC materials; b) initiating CFC recovery, reclanation, and recycling
operation; and c) strengthening the institutional capacity of the OTF to implement the
Country Program.
IV. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
7.    The project consists of technology conversion in 12 sub-projects in seven enterprises
and technical assistance and training component involving 4 sub-projects in the Institute of
Refrigeration and the Ministry of Environment. Some of the CFC consuming enterprises,
included in the Country Program, are undergoing financial difficulties due to the present
Bulgarian economic situation. Thus, the Bank performed a financial viability analysis to
ensure project sustainability by including enterprises in the project that are viable and do
not show signs of closure.
8.    Most enterprises included in the Country Program have been included in the project
with three exceptions. Enterprises DZU and Opticoelectron were excluded from the
original list of enterprises proposed in the Country Program because of poor financial
standing and uncertain future. VMZ-compressors, a new enterprise with no production so
far, was also excluded from the Country Program list since it did not meet Montreal
Protocol criteria of having an existing ODS consumption pattern, to be phased out. It is
expected that the Government of Bulgaria will review the future of these three enterprises
with the Montreal Protocol Executive Committee in the context of requesting extension on
the phase-out schedule.
9.    The present consumption of 437 tons of CFCs, scheduled to be phased out as per
Montreal Protocol guidelines, will be reduced by 83% by this project. The remaining 72
tons of ODS is consumed by DZU (maximum capacity 60 tons), Opticolectron (maximum
capacity 3 tons) and a number of small non-refrigeration foam enterprises with limited CFC
use. The non-refrigeration foam enterprises are converting to non-CFC technology without
GEF assistance since the technology conversion process is simple and does not entail major
investments.



- 4 -
10.   All sub-projects included in the project have been reviewed and approved by
specialists from the GEF Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP) who confirmed
the consistency of the project with Montreal Protocol guidelines and Country Program
objectives. In addition, the Bank's Ozone Operations Research Group (OORG) has
reviewed and approved the technology used, cost effectiveness, ODS replacement substance,
implementation time-frame, and incremental operating costs for all sub-projects. On
September 22, 1995 the GEF approved the sub-projects included in this document for grant
financing from the Global Environment Trust Fund.
Technology Conversion
11.   The technology conversion consists of sub-projects in the refrigeration, foam and
solvent sectors in seven enterprises. A more detailed description of each sub-project is
provided in Annex 2.
(a)   Refrigeration: The sector comprises of five sub-projects where HFC-134a will be used
as a refrigerant instead of CFC-12. The sub-projects will support design testing and
retrofitting of refrigerator and compressor production lines to use the replacement
refrigerant (HFC-134a). The sub-projects belong to enterprises MRAZ, Frigo, Brist,
and Klimat and will reduce a total of 99 tons in annual ODS consumption.
(b)   Foam: The sector comprises of six sub-projects where cyclopentane will be used as
a foam blowing agent instead of CFC- 11 in one polyurethene and five refrigeration
plants. The sub-projects will support design testing, evaluating energy efficiency of
refrigerators with a cyclopentane foaming process, and retrofitting of the production
line. Adequate safety equipment will also be installed since cyclopentane is an
explosive and flammable substance. The sub-projects belong to enterprises Vazhod,
Klimat, MRAZ, Frigo, Brist, and Zem and will reduce a total of 115 tons in annual
ODS consumption.
(c)   Solvents: There is one sub-project in this sector where CFC-113, used to wash ball
bearings, will be replaced by water, corrosion inhibitors, and kerosene. The sub-
project will support testing to determine the volume mix of the replacement washing
substances, retrofitting the production line, and installing ventilation for kerosene.
The sub-project belongs to enterprise VMZ-ball bearings and will reduce a 52 tons
in annual ODS consumption.
Technical Assistance and Institutional Strengthening
12.   The following sub-projects involve the Institute of Refrigeration and the institutional
strengthening component of the OTF in the Ministry of Environment.



- 5 -
(a)   Institute of Refrigeration: There are three sub-projects with the Institute that will
address: i) development of a CFC-recycling program; ii) training refrigeration
technicians use non-ODS refrigerants and providing adequate equipments for the
recycling program; and iii) retrofitting reliability testing equipments for HFC-134a
type refrigerators, compressors, and condensing units. These sub-projects will help
reduce the ODS consumption in the service sector by 100 tons.
(b)   Institutional Strengthening: This component involves technical assistance and training
to the OTF to implement, monitor and enforce the Country Program. The sub-
project will provide for consultants who will assist the OTF on technical, industrial
safety, procurement, accounting, and administrative needs. Details of institutional
strengthening are provided in Annex 2.
13.  Industrial safety in the use of cyclopentane in foam production is an important
concern and has been addressed by: a) including adequate safety equipments during project
preparation; b) additional sub-project review by experts; c) Bank review, with assistance
from experts, of the procurement packages. Industrial safety concerns will be further
addressed in the Environmental Impact Assessments (ELAs) that will include a section on
health and safety plan for each sub-project. The ELAs will have to be approved prior to
project implementation by the Ministry of Environment.
V. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
14.   The estimated total project cost is US $ 13.5 million which includes goods and
services, technical assistance and training, price and physical contingencies (15%), and fee
(3%) for First Private Bank, the local financial agent (LFA) as shown below in Table 1.
Details of project costs are shown in Schedule A. The project will be financed by a US $
10.5 million grant (SDR 7.1 million equivalent) from the GEF Trust Fund and US $ 3.0
million contribution from the enterprises. All costs are incremental in nature and have been
calculated in accordance with Montreal Protocol guidelines. Specifically, the requested
grant is only for items and activities included in the Indicative List of Eligible Incremental
Costs adopted by the Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol. The unit cost
estimates are higher than those reviewed by the Council. The difference is explained by:
i) the US Dollar exchange rate movements against the Deutsche Mark since the project was
prepared; and ii) upgrading of safety equipments to meet international industrial safety
standards.
VI. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION RESPONSIBILITIES
15.   The four-person Ozone Task Force (OTF) within the Ministry of Environment would
have overall responsibility for project implementation. The OTF has been established since



- 6 -
1992 and has had responsibility for development of the Country Program for ODS phase-
out. The OTF will also seek technical assistance as needed from the Refrigeration Institute.
Experts from both the Refrigeration Institute and the regional offices of the Ministry of
Environment have technical expertise in the refrigeration and foam subsectors and a well-
established working relationship with the enterprises. The Institutional Development
component of the project will also provide resources to the OTF for training and technical
assistance. The project implementation schedule and responsibilities of the OTF, First
Private Bank and the enterprises are outlined in Annex 1. The Government agreed to these
implementation arrangements during negotiations.

Implementation
16.   Since the project is expected to be completed within 3 years, much of the "upstream"
implementation work, including preparation of procurement packages and initial contacts
with suppliers has already been completed. Enterprises have already identified space
requirements and production arrangements for the equipment to be installed. The
Refrigeration Institute is preparing a detailed monthly program for training of refrigeration
service technicians. The focus of implementation will be on procurement and installation
of the non-ODS equipment as quickly as possible. It is expected that the grant will become
Effective in December 1995 and the project will be completed by April 30, 1998.
Procurement and disbursement arrangements are indicated in Schedule B.



-7-
Monitoring and Evaluation
17.   The OTF will have overall responsibility for monitoring project progress and it will
submit quarterly progress reports to the Bank. The objective of the progress reports will be
to monitor sub-project activities and assess the effectiveness of the GEF grant in assisting
with ODS phase-out. The participating enterprises and the First Private Bank will provide
information on a regular basis to the OTF for the progress report. The format of the
progress report is provided in the Project Implementation Manual. The OTF will continue
to monitor ODS consumption and phase-out on a regular basis and provide the status of
ODS consumption to the officials of the Montreal Protocol and GEF when required. With
assistance from the Regional Directorates the OTF will be responsible for preparing and
enforcing environmental and safety regulations regarding use of the new equipment. It will
also be responsible for preparation of a Project Completion Report, to be completed within
six months after the end of project implementation.
Retroactive Financing
18.   Consistent with the November 1994 GEF guidelines used to develop this project,
expenditures incurred by enterprises on the sub-projects after October 31, 1993 and before
the date of grant signing are eligible for retroactive financing. GEF will allow 40% of the
grant or US $ 4.2 million to be used for retroactive financing for sub-project expenditures.
However, based on the enterprise expenditures so far it is expected that retroactive
financing will be limited to about 15% of the total grant amount. Expenditures are eligible
for retroactive financing if the procurement process outlined in Schedule B is followed, the
procurement is on a competitive basis against acceptable specifications, and all records are
available for Bank's review.
Accounts and Audits
19.   A private Auditor, acceptable to the Bank, would: (a) audit First Private Bank, OTT,
and enterprise sub-project accounts; (b) apply auditing standards and procedures satisfactory
to the Bank that conform to generally accepted auditing practices; (c) carry-out auditing
work in a timely manner; and (d) render an audit opinion not later than six months after
the end of each fiscal year. The Auditor would provide preliminary assistance in financial
management and application of modern auditing procedures to First Private Bank staff as
necessary, including assistance in setting-up the format of maintaining sub-project accounts.
The First Private Bank will be responsible for employing private auditor(s) and will also be
responsible for paying the auditors fees.



-8 -
Supervision
20.   Supervision by a Bank team will take place semi-annually following the submission
of the progress report by the OTF. The supervision missions would be composed of the task
manager and a financial specialist, to be supported by ODS specialists as needed, and will
require about 12 staff weeks in the first year and 10 staff weeks thereafter.
VII. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
21.   The project will help the Government of Bulgaria in meeting its goal, outlined in the
Country Program, to phase-out the use of CFCs by compensating enterprises for incremental
costs incurred during the process of technology conversion. The Country Program is
supported by a broad spectrum of interested parties, including the Ministries of
Environment, Trade and Foreign Trade Relations, Economic Development, Regional
Development and Construction, Finance, Labor and Social Security, Industry, participating
enterprises, and NGOs. Technology conversion will allow enterprises to be competitive both
in the domestic and export markets since enterprises involved in the project have an export
market that varies from 10 to 65% (Annex 2, Attachment 1). Only one of the enterprises,
involved in the project, is privately owned. However, sustainability has been ensured by a
financial viability analysis of the enterprises, which currently receive no budgetary support
from the State. The presence of a well defined market, a credible business plan, prospects
of maintaining a positive cash flow from operations, and technical capabilities were used as
criteria for selecting enterprises. The Institutional Strengthening component of the OTF will
enable them to continue monitoring ODS phase-out activities as per the strategy outlined
in the Country Program.
VIII. LESSONS FROM BANK PROJECTS
22.   ODS phase-out projects are currently being prepared or implemented with the Bank
as a Trustee of the Montreal Protocol in about 15 countries including China, Turkey,
Tunisia, Jordan, Brazil, India, Thailand, and Venezuela. GEF funded ODS projects have
been prepared or are under preparation in the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Slovakia, and
Hungary. In Venezuela a project has been successfully completed and the project in Turkey
is being implemented satisfactorily. Experience indicates the need for flexibility and
simplicity in the project design and financing mechanisms, well prepared sub-projects and
implementation plans, and most importantly, the need to strengthen local capacity during
preparation and implementation of the project.



- 9 -
IX. RATIONALE FOR BANK AND GEF INVOLVEMENT
23.  This project has been developed and structured based on specific ODS phase-out
requirements in Bulgaria (as outlined in the Country Program) and the general project
eligibility criteria guidelines of the Montreal Protocol and the GEF Scientific and Technical
Advisory Panel (STAP). Funding for this stratospheric ozone layer protection project is
requested from the GEF on the basis that Bulgaria:
(a)  is eligible for GEF assistance;
(b)  is not classified as a developing country and is not eligible for funding from
the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol;
(c)   has completed the preparation of a Country Program; and
(d)   has ratified the Vienna Convention and Montreal Protocol.
24.  Funding for this project has been obtained from the GEF on the basis that: a)
Bulgaria is eligible for GEF assistance and the project satisfies the ODS phase-out objective
of GEF; b) GEF provides assistance to countries like Bulgaria which despite low per
capita GDP are not considered as developing countries as per the Montreal Protocol and
thus not eligible to receive funds from the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the
Montreal Protocol; c) Bulgaria has completed and submitted the Country Program by which
it has committed itself to follow the Montreal Protocol ODS phase-out schedule; and d) the
GEF grant assistance will allow enterprises to convert to non-ODS technology and help
them to remain in business.
X. PROJECT BENEFITS
25.  The project will contribute to global efforts to protect the ozone layer that will
benefit human health and the environment. The GEF grant financing will assist Bulgaria
to meet its obligations to the Montreal Protocol. The project will phase-out an annual
consumption of 365 tons of CFCs which corresponds to a 83% reduction in use of CFCs that
are scheduled to be phased out. The technology conversion will allow Bulgarian enterprises
to conform to international standards and retain and expand their domestic and export
markets.



- 10-
XI. PROJECT RISKS
26.   There are no significant technical risks associated with the project, since the proposed
technology is being successfully used in many West European countries and experienced
suppliers would supply, test, and install the equipments.  The risk of inadequate
implementation capacity of the OTF is addressed by the institutional strengthening
component of the project which will provide training and technical assistance to the OTF.
In addition, the OTF will be supported by the First Private Bank as well as a local
procurement agent for effective implementation.
27.   There is a risk of closure of enterprises due to poor financial standing in the
transitional state of the Bulgarian economy. However, the Bank conducted a thorough
financial viability analysis of enterprises and non-viable enterprises have not been included
in the project. The enterprises included in the project have a market for their goods, have
registered increases in first quarter 1995 revenues compared to the same period 1994, and
have prospects of maintaining a positive cash flow from operations. The careful selection
of enterprises minimizes the risk of providing GEF assistance to enterprises that may cease
operations due to poor financial standing.
28.  The project may be delayed due to slow Parliamentary ratification of the grant
agreement between the Bank and the Government of Bulgaria. The Government recognizes
that the project has to meet a critical deadline and will try to expedite the ratification
process of the agreement which will not include any major policy issues.
XII. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
29.   The project provides significant global environmental benefits with the reduction of
the ODS use. There are no major environmental concerns associated with the installation
or operation of non-ODS technologies and the Bank has classified the project as category
B that requires limited environmental analysis. The limited environmental risks are
associated with the use of cyclopentane, a flammable substance, in the foam sector and the
potential increase in wastewater in the solvents sector.
30.   All sub-projects will follow the industrial safety guidelines recommended by the
suppliers and the safety equipments proposed in the sub-projects to handle cyclopentane
have been approved by the OORG. The wastewater facility in the solvents sub-project is
adequate to treat the additional wastewater.  In addition, Environmental Impact
Assessments (EIA) as per the Bulgarian Environmental Protection Act will be completed
on all sub-projects. The EIAs will include health and safety plans for each sub-project which
will address industrial safety concerns in the use of cyclopentane. The Bank and the MOE



- 11 -
will address industrial safety concerns in the use of cyclopentane. The Bank and the MOE
will approve all EIAs prior to sub-project implementation. The MOE will monitor and
enforce regulations on industrial safety and the environment during project implementation.
XIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
31.   During negotiations, the Government agreed to the following:
a)   Project Implementation: The Ozone Task Force with assistance from the
First Private Bank and participating enterprises will be responsible for

BULGARIA: OZONE DEPLETING SUBSTANCE PHASE-OUT PROJECT
PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT ARRANGEMENTS
Procurement
1.   Procurement of goods and services would be made in accordance with 'Guidelines
for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits' (January 1995). As part of project
preparation, the enterprises, First Private Bank, and Ministry of Environment received
procurement training to assist them in implementing Bank's procurement procedures. The
Ministry of the Environment, with assistance from a procurement agent, will have overall
responsibility for procurement. To meet the Montreal Protocol requirement of ODS phase-
out, enterprises will have to purchase and install the equipment financed under the project
as soon as possible. Thus, the procurement procedures have been designed with special
attention to ensure expediency during project implementation. A summary of goods to be
procured is shown in Table B1. The Government agreed to these procurement
arrangements during negotiations.
2.    Goods. To the extent possible, contracts for goods have been grouped to allow for
the procurement of larger packages. However, each enterprise would procure its own
equipment with assistance and supervision from the OTF and the procurement agent. The
equipment procurement is expected to be for: (a) modification of refrigeration production
lines; (b) modification of foaming machines and replacement of injection pumps; (c)
modification of solvent cleaning systems; (d) up-grading safety systems and testing
laboratories; (e) limited office equipment; and (f) training by suppliers to the workers in the
participating enterprises that acquire new equipments.
3.    Contracts larger than US $ 400,000 amounting to about US $ 0.9 million would be
procured on the basis of Bank's Limited International Bidding (LIB) process since there are
limited number of suppliers for specialized refrigeration and foam manufacturing
equipments. Also, for equipment retrofitting there are a limited number of suppliers that
can provide equipments compatible with the existing production line. Contracts between
US $ 50,000 and US $ 400,000 amounting to about US $ 6.0 million would be procured on
the basis of International Shopping (IS) with at least three price quotations from at least two
countries. Such an arrangement will allow the enterprises to timely procure the goods and
maintain the ODS phase-out schedule. Local Shopping could be applied for contracts less
than US $ 50,000 up to an aggregate of about US $ 0.2 million based on at least three price



- 16 -                              Schedule B
quotations from local suppliers. Enterprises with foreign licensing arrangement would
procure from suppliers recommended by the foreign partners. In view of the technical
assistance, training, and guarantees provided by the existing licensors, such Direct Contract
procurement procedures amounting to about US $ 2.5 million are acceptable. All
procurement involving sole source and other contracts valued above US $ 400,000 would be
subject to prior review by the Bank.

4.     Services The project involves consultants' services for: a) developing and conducting
a training program for refrigeration technicians in the service sector; and b) technical
assistance provided to the OTF. The total value of services required is estimated to be $
0.6 million. The training program involves 1,200 technicians to be trained by the
Refrigeration Institute within a period of 2 years and is estimated to cost $ 0.4 million. Sole
sourcing to the Refrigeration Institute which has qualified staff and adequate facilities is
acceptable, since it is the only Institute in the country that has research and training
capacity. The technical assistance provided to the OTF will involve consultant services in
such areas as procurement, auditing, and refrigeration and foam technology. The hiring of
