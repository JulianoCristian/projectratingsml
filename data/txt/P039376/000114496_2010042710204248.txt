We refer to the GET Grant Agreement (Ozone Depleting Substances Phaseout

in dollars a special deposit account in the National Bank of the Republic of 
Bulgaria on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Implementing Agency. 
Deposits into, and payments out of, the Special Account shall be made in 
accordance with the provisions of Schedule 4 to this Agreement."
Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing amendment by signing, dating 
and returning to us the attached copy of this letter.
Very truly yours,
