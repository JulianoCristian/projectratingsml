MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN IN AN AMOUhT EQUIVALENT TO US$61 MILLION
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR THE THIRD JABOTABEK URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (JUDP III)
1.          The following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Indonesia for US$61 million equivalent is submitted for approval.
The loan would have a term of 20 years including five years grace, at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate, and would assist in financing a Third
Jabotabek Urban Development Project. The Government of Japan will cofinance
the project with a US$0.6 million grant from the Japan Grant Fund.
2.          Sector Background.  Jabotabek is GOI's mnemonic for the urban
region consisting of the Province of DKI Jakarta, and the surrounding local
governments of Bogor, Tangerang and Bekasi together with City of Bogor.
Jakarta is the national capital and seat of government, and commercial and
administrative hub of the country. A disproportionate amount of the burden of
population growth falls on metropolitan Jakarta. Between 1960 and 1980, the
population of Jakarta doubled and by 1986 fully 20? (8 million) of the urban
population, 5? of the total national population, lived and worked in the city.
However, urbanization has outgrown the administrative boundaries of DRI
Jakarta and, with the spread of industrial and informal sector residential
development (much of which lacks infrastructure and utility services), the
surrounding 'fringe" areas now contain a further 2.3 million people. The
metropolitan area now ranks among the 25 largest zonurbatiois in the world.
Jabotabek's size and rapid growth have helped to provide employment
opportunities for surplus rural labor and has expanded the production base for
Indonesia's industrial sector and 17? of GDP is now generated there. By the
year 2005 metropolitan Jakarta is projected to have a total population
approaching 20 million compared to 13 million in 1990. For Jabotabek as a
whole, the current population of about 15 million is expected to exceed 26
million by the 7ear 2005.
3.          Investment in Jakarta's infrastructure has not kept pace with
needs and considerable deficiencies remain both in coverage and quality,
particularly in transport, water supply and sanitation. In addition,
*      institutional and environmental problems include: (a) poor cost recovery,
organization and management resulting in restrictive practices for
distributing water and excessive prices to the poor; (b) severe pollution of
*      surface water and increasingly of groundwater, from human and municipal wastes
and from a rapidly rising volume of industrial and toxic wastes; (c)
inadequate micro-infrastructure and basic environmental sanitation services in
the urban kampungs, where most low-income people live, resulting in unhealthy
environment which limits the social and economic potential of the human
capital resources of the capital region; (d) inadequate policies and
operational programs for OWH of infrastructure and utility services; local
revenue generation and the use of municipal borrowing and private sector
participation in delivery of municipal services; and (e) unclear relationships



- 2 -
between municipal and central government authorities with respect to
assignment of responsibilities for preparation, appraisal, financing and
implementation and O&M of infrastructure services. Nevertheless, Jabotabek
local governments have significant manpower resources and growing experience
to address many of these challenges.
4.          To address these priorities, the Government issued, in 1987, a
Statement of Policies for Urban Development which represents a consolidated
view of the principal constraints arising and the objectives prescribed for
the eevelopment effort in the sector.  This Policy Statement includes2 (a)
stre.,gthening local governments to assume the leading role in developing,
operating atd maintaining local services; (b) carrying out planning,
programming and identification of investments on the basis of a decentralized
and integrated (Integrated Urban Infrastructure Development Program -- IWIDP)
concept; (c) mobilizing additional local revenues and optimizing their use;
(d) implementing a coordinated financing system for the development and
administration of local services; and (e) strengthening the consultative
process at various levels of government. The current five-year plan (Repelita
V) also promised greater attention to operation and maintenance of local
infrastructure and services and the welfare of the urban poor. To this end,
integration of urban kampungs more fully into their respective urban systems
through a community oriented Kampung Improvement Program (KIF) has been
adopted as the principal GOI policy for alleviating urban poverty.
5.          Experience with implementation in DKI Jakarta has been mixed, but
generally good where the local government has had strong commitment and close
control over project management. The KIP has been successful and popular.
9ED reports confirmed that the DII Jakarta KIP unit (Bappem MHT), which
consolidated implementation of this multisectoral program, has been a key
element in the success of the program there and that expansion and
acceleration of the program nationwide has been due, in part to the
establishment of similar units elsewhere. The First Jabotabek Urban
Development Project (Ln. 2932-IND--JUDP I is proceeding well and on schedule.
The Second Jabotabek Urban Development Project (JUDP II, Ln. 3219-IND) was
approved by the Bank's Board on June 5, 1990. Particular attention has been
given to improving project coordination and a Jabotabek Urban Project
Coordination Office (JUPCO) was established in May, 1988. JUPCO's experience
has been taken into account in the design of the proposed project for which
the role of JUPCO will be expanded to ensure satisfactory monitoring and
evaluation.
6.          Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Support for the KIP program in
DKI Jakarta in the early 1970's initiated the Bank's long association with
urban development efforts in Indonesia. Bank involvement has been
instrumental in focussing and coordinating the various government agencies
involved in the Jabotabek area on essential elements of urban policy and
investment needs and in addressing critical sector issues. Because of its
lcng association with urban development efforts in Indonesia, and the KIP in
particular, the Bank is well placed to help the government achieve these
objectives.

7.          ProJect Objectives.  The proposed project is designed to assist
GOI efforts in Jabotabeks (i) to introduce a more effective and sustainable
approach to provision of basic services, through extensive community
participation and incorporation of social and economic development in
recognized low-income urban communities; (ii) to strengthen environmental
protection and pollution control in the Jakarta region; and (iii) to improve
maintenance of existing infrastructure networks, and provide a firmer basis
for planning future development priorities-
8.          Project Description.  The project consists of: (a) a program of
upgrading of basic urban infrastructure and uitility services covering over 1.5
million people in over 402 of all predominantly low-income kampungs; building
on the experience of the earlier KIP, the community-based infrastructure
program proposed under the project would provide a full range of services in
existing and recently settled kampungs and would expand access to credit to
low-income groups and individuals for on-plot sanitation and small-scale
businesses; (b) secondary collection of household refuse to the 75 districts
(kelurahans) to be upgraded in DKI together with 8 districts in priority
flood-prone areas through transportation by private contractors for final
disposal; cleaning up informal dump sites, particularly along canals; and
technical assistance to improve resource recovery through waste materials
separation programs; (c) institutional strengthening and training in
monitoring and enforcement of pollution control in the responsible provincial
agencies in DKI Jakarta and West Java and equipment for monitoring ambient
water and air quality and waste discharges together with: (i) development of a
natural resources inventory and formulation of a pollution reduction strategy
for the Jabotabek region; and (ii) feasibility studies to prepare projects
for: industrial joint waste treatment; and high polluting small-scale
industries; (d) technical assistance for urban spatial management and
monitoring including assistance for: (i) updating of the Jabotabek
Metropolitan Development Plan; (ii) establishing a development monitoring
system; (iii) adding information to existing base maps for development
planning, tax administration and environmental management in Botabek, (iv)
planning studies for the urbanizing fringe areas; and (e) implementation of
improved O&M in DKI Jakarta and the Botabek local governments.
9.          The total project cost is estimated at US$97.0 million of which
about US$33.3 million is expected to be in foreign exchange. The Bank loan of
US$61 million would finance about 702 of total project costs (net of land and
taxes). Of the proceeds of the Bank Loan, US$54.8 million equivalent would be
onlent to DKI Jakarta and local governments of Bogor, Tangerang a d Bekasi for
a term of 20 years including five years' grace at 9.25 percent interest
including 0.25 percent bank fee, and 0.75 percent commitment charge on the
undisbursed amount. The Government would bear the foreign exchange and
variable interest risk. Retroactive financing of up to US$1.0 million
equivalent would cover eligible expenditures incurred after March 1, 1990.
10.         The total project cost and financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Procurement and disbursement arrangements are summarized in Schedule B. A

timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank operations
in Indonesia are given in Schedules C and D respectively. A Staff Appraisal
Report No. 8397-IND dated June 19, 1990 is being distributed separately.
11.         Agreed Actions. Agreement has been reached with GOI on the
following points: (a) the provisions of an Implementation Action Plan together
with a model Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for KIP to be entered into with
each involved community as a basis for; and prior to commencing works and
relating to policy guidelines: (i) on site selection criteria; cost recovery
arrangements; staffing schedules and training programs: creration and
maintenance arrangements; physical development and tenure; land acquisition,
resettlement and protection against redevelopment; design criteria and
physical services; small-scale credit; the community development process;
program organization, coordination and implementation arrangements; and
project monitoring arrangements; (b) onlending arrangements and terms; (c) the
role of the expanded JUPCO and its relationships with implementing agencies;
(d) private sector participation in secondary collection and acceptable
arrangements for the disposal site; and (e) Bank prior review of procurement.
DKI Jakarta has issued a Governor's Decree to establish the more
comprehensive, community-based approach to KIP. Conditions of effectiveness
are the execution of subsidiary loan agreements and the establishment of the
JUPCO coordinating division for the project and staffing of key positions the
staffing of key positions. Conditions of disbursoment are issuance of
kabupaten level decrees modifying RIP.
12.         Environmental Impact.  The proje ; will provide significant
benefits at the household and neightorhood level where residents, most of whom
are poor, suffer daily from environmental degradation. The project would
provide a more constant, accessible and higher qualitv water sup-ply for these
communities. Household and public toilets will reduce exposure to sewage. and
improved solid waste collection will reduce drain blockages and, together with
sanitation improvements, will reduce community exposure to disease vectors.
The public health information and education campaign will be ori nted towards
raising awareness of hygiene, primary health care, and proper v i of facili-
ties by the beneficiaries.  These activities will greatly enh:   ? personal and
household cleanliness and convenience, improve sanitary condi   is and aesthe-
tics, decrease flooding and odor. In addition, the environmental protection
component will establish a framework for improvements in environmental
planning for the industrial sector and prepare an institution-.- basis for
subsequent improved enforcement of environmentally souad disposal of wastes.
13.         Benefits and Risks.  The proposed project will implement a more
effective, community-based approach to expand access to basic urban services
through the Kampung Improvement Program (KIP) - designated by GOI as the
principal means of alleviating urban poverty: improve environmental health in
these communities; and help stem further environmental degradation. The risks
of inappropriate location and consequent poor use and deterioration of
facilities provided, as under previous phases of KIP, would be minimized
through stronger community participation, The lack of extensive experience in
responsible local governments with the social and community development



- 5 -
aspects of KIP would be addressed under the project through participation of
voluntary, community-based organizations with proven expertise in this area.
To avoid earlier problems with sanitation improvements, a variety of
appropriate, low-cost solutions would be used reflecting prevailing population
densities, ground conditions, etc. To minimize the risks on small-scale
credit, it will be initiated at a pilot scale in each district, and
conditioned by community savings mobilized by qualifying credit agencies. To
minimize the risk of uneconomic and poor operational performance of secondary
refuse collection, private sector involvement is to be sought and equipment
will be leased out to private contractors to reduce the risk of excessive down
time and siort effective life due to lack of maintenance. It would be
unrealistic to expect Institutional capability for monitoring and enforcement
of pollution controls to develop quickly and efforts under the project might
not become fully effective until clear standards are prescribed by the Central
Government, and a strong legal framework for enforcement emerges. GOI focus
in this area continues to crystalize but progress is likely to be gradual.
Possible minor environmental adverse impacts of the project related to on plot
sanitation and refuse disposal have been identified and will be monitored and
mitigated through the agreed project design and operation and maintenance
procedures. The annual program review. in which the Bank would participate,
provides an effective means of monitoring performance in this and other key
performance areas of the project.
14.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and I recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed lo4n.
