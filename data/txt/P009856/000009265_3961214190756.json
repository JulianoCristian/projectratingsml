The project aimed at helping reduce the deficits in\n            urban shelter, infrastructure, and services in the main\n            centers of the state. To this effect it included the\n            following items addressing a complex set of sub-objectives:\n            (i) development of 100 hectare in six cities, (ii) town\n            planning schemes covering 570 hectare in three cities\n            including land readjustment and basic infrastructure, (iii)\n            upgrading of 250 hectare of slums in five cities, (iv)\n            improvement of solid waste disposal services in five cities,\n            (v) other urban infrastructure (water supply, sewerage,\n            storm drainage, etc. in four areas, and (vi) institutional\n            strengthening at local and state level through technical\n            assistance. Bank\u2019s performance was unsatisfactory.\n            Borrower's performance was unsatisfactory. The key\n            lessons learned from the project were: (a) the project\n            lacked realism, partly due to hasty preparation apparently\n            related to  International Development Association (IDA)\n            concern to have a large impact on the sector quickly; (b)\n            the project should have had less components and objectives,\n            to allow for the weakness of the implementing agencies which\n            were already evident at Project preparation; (c) the\n            implementation prospects for complex projects involving\n            urban services and investments would be strengthened if, at\n            project launch, a strong intermediary capacity is\n            established; and (d) the monitoring framework should be\n            aimed at ensuring that supervision missions avoid spending\n            excessive time checking on procurement status and physical\n            progress in many sub-projects, and can focus on more\n            strategic issues."}, "docdt": "1996-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
