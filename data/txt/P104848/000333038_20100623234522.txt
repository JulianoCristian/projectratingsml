canals and to Sai Gon River. On the remaining sections there are no drainage 
system along the highway and the rain water flows through bothe sides by 
horizontal sewers. 
 
2.1.2. The environment issues of Ha Noi Highway Enlargement 
Subproject 
In the construction and exploitation of the Ha Noi Highway 
Enlargement Project must concern the following environment issues:   
 
1) Air pollution  
 
The activities are specified to emit the dust and hazardous gas include: 
Page  11
11
x
To break down to clear the site; 
x
To dig and level the highway base, drainage system at the 
enlargement section; 
x
Activities at the construction site, tents and the temporary waste 
soil, rock keeping; 
x
Activities of construction machines, equipments, transportation 
vehicles during the construction time;  
 
2) Noise and Shaking Impacts 
The construction activities may cause noise, shaking includes the site 
clearance, digging and soil transportation… As calculated in EIA the noise 
level created during the construction and traffic reduce to the allowable limit 
following to TCVN 5949-1998 at the distance of 130m during daytime; and 
in nighttime, especially the limited noise level at the very far distance from 
the construction site. 
The activities of the construction machines during the construction 
time will create the shaking level from 74 to 82 dB at the distance of 10m 
and from 64 to 71dB at the distance of 30m. Compared with the standard  
TCVN 6962-2001 on the allowable sshaking acceleration in the construction 
activities stipulated in the resident area, business, service and production 
areas do not exceed 75dB, the maximum allowable shaking level is 6dB at 
the distance of 10m. 
 
3) Waste water impacts   
 
The waste water created from the construction and domestic activities 
from the workers, in which the waste water from the operation, maintenance 
of the machines, construction equipments contains the large quantity of 
organic substances, oils, and suspended solids.  
 
4)  Waste solid impacts   
 
The waste solid from the construction machines and equipments and 
from the worker activities includes: 
·
The chemical waste solid: waste battery, the waste material 
contaning acid and alkaline, and most is waste containing oil. 
However this quantity is not large; 
·
The domestic waste includes the waste from officers, workers at 
the construction site. The composition of this waste contains 
mostly the organic, easily disintegrated and some difficultly 
disintegrated are plastic, metal cans.      
Page  12

2.2. Appraisal of the compliance of environment safety of the Ha Noi 
Highway Enlargement Subproject 
Appropriateness assessment to ES requirements of the the Subproject 
includes the assessment according to the requirements of GOV and those of 
WB as “Environment Safeguard Guideline” of HDP. It includes: 
1) Review the environment safeguard documents provided by the 
investor before building the subproject, particularly the approval 
decisions and appraisals of the authorities;  
2)  Compare the availlable ES documents to the requirements of HDP; 
3)  Visit the subproject site.  
 
Below is the consultant’s detailed assessment. 
2.2.1. The appropriateness of the government environment safety  
When the investor met with HFIC’s authorities to arrange the budget for 
the subproject, he had already the ES relating documents:   
 
(1) EIA of the Ha Noi Highway Enlargement Project with the 
section from Sai Gon Bridge to Tan Van Crossroad; 
 
(2) 
Decision No 1071/Q
-BTNMT of MONRE dated 11/6/2009 on 
the approval of EIA of the project of Ha Noi Highway Enlargement Project 
from The North of Sai Gon Bridge to Tan Van Crossroad. 
Some following assessments after consider the relating documents 
areas follows:  
·
Apart from the compliance with the ES requirements of GOV, the 
subproject needs also to comply with the ES requirements of HDP. In 
principle, one of the compulsory procedures to approve the project is the 
approval decision EIA of Ha Noi Highway Enlargement Project. The 
project EIA has also presented completely the measures to minimize the 
negative impacts during the construction time as well as in exploitation 
time. 
·
Because the project uses Ha Noi Highway as the main road and the 
present auxiliary road system in the project area to collect, transport the 
materials and the wastes to the suitable storage that the investor will sign 
the contract with HCM Environment Company to transport to Hoc Mon 
as in EIA. However in the tender document, this content has been 
included into the tender content and the contractor will implement this 
item. However to ensure the environment safety during the transportation 
the investor must include in the contract the tie item to cover to prevent 
the dust emission in the dry season and prevent the mud flow on the road 
during the transportation.   
Page  13
13
·
During the construction stage  some materials such as soil
,
rock, sand… 
bought from Hoa An Mine, Bien Hoa sand reservoir, Nhon Trach, Dong 
Nai…and transported to the construction site with large quantity, muc 
traffic that the cover, safety are very necessary. Discussing with the 
investor and considering the project contents showed that these 
transportation were compulsory (via contracts) to use the Ha Noi 
Highway is the main route. Actually, in project design  the design 
consultant had surveyed the material mines used for the project include 
the material mines in Binh Duong and Dong Nai approved by the 
investor so that the compulsory route is Sai Gon River and Dong Nai 
River and after that using Ha Noi Highway Route to the construction 
site. In this construction area there are only Ha Noi Highway which may 
undertake the heavy transportation, the nearest distance that ensure the 
economical efficiency for the contractors. 
·
In the rainy season, on the construction area there are the dangerous 
warning boards at the deep pits or the fences isolated. It is necessary to 
check permanently the stability of the fences especially in the rainy and 
storm season. During the construction time EIA presented the fences will 
be installed with the steel sheet with 2m in high to isolate between the 
construction site and the traffic in order to prevent the dust emission, 
noise and the traffic accidents of the workers and the trffic participants 
on the Ha Noi Highway. The cost for this work is in the cost tenders, so 
the contractors will implement as the tender documents. If the 
contractors do not implement completely or not ensure the technical 
conditions and safety, the investor will hire the 3
rd
 party to implement 
this work and the cost paid will be deducted in the contract. However the 
investor needs to supervise and check the stability of the fences and 
adjust in time when the fences are collapsed by collision, especially in 
the rainy and storm season.  
·
During the construction time and exploitation time, the environment 
protection in the material, soil,…transportation to the construction time 
and the waste material transportation out of the construction site as 
presented completely in EIA that is to constract with the functional 
agencies implementing as regulation. However it is necessary to inform 
the contents of environment protection in EIA to the contractors and they 
implement as the investor’s commitment in EIA.  
·
The cost to ensure the environment hygien in the construction site and 
workers’ tent includes the water pouring to reduce the dust, site clearance 
after construction… has been included in the tender cost. The number of 
water pouring is depended on the daily weather and the consultant’s

and specialized management agencies will check carefully. If the 
contractors do not implement following to the consultant’s requirement, 
the reflections of investor, specialized management agencies and 
inhabitants, traffic participants the investor will hire the 3
rd
 party 
implement in time and the cost paid for it will be deducted into the 
contraction cost.  
·
Reduce the impact of noise, shaking during the construction especially at 
the sensitive regions such as Ky Quang 3 (km 0+800), Health Center of 
An Phu Ward (km 3+000), Resident Are at North Rach Chiec (km 3+800 
–
km 4+000), Tourist Labor Union of Thu Duc District (km 6+500); 
International Sai Gon University (km 7+600) must implement closely 
with the control, inspection the construction time and vehicles as 
presented in EIA. 
·
During the construction stage EIA proposed to install the steel fence 
covered with steel sheet in 2m high in order to isolate the construction 
site with the traffic road and limit the dust emission, noise and prevent 
the accident of workers and the traffic participants. The investor will pay 
the cost of fence and it was included the tender price and the contractor 
will implement right as in the tender document. If the contractors do not 
implement completely or not safe and technical conditions, the owner 
will hire the 3
rd
 party to implement this work and the cost paid will be 
deducted in the value of the contract. However it is necessary that the 
owner’s consultant needs to inspect the firmness of the fence and repair 
on time when it has disproportion by collision, especially in the rainy 
season. Increase the construction in the evening and night excluding the 
region near Ky Quang 3 pagoda. 
·
In community consultation, the investor has consulted and received 
enough the responses with docements of the People Committees and 
Fatherland Committees of 13 wards related with the project in which 
there are 6 wards that related to the HDP project as follws:: 
-
People Committee and Fatherland Committee of  Thao Dien Ward; 
-
People Committee and Fatherland Committee of Bình An Ward; 
-
People Committee and Fatherland Committee of An Phu Ward; 
-
People Committee and Fatherland Committee of Phuoc Long A Ward; 
-
People Committee and Fatherland Committee of Phuoc Long B Ward; 
-
People Committee and Fatherland Committee of Truong Tho Ward 
with 100% of comments agree with the impacts and the mitigation measures 
presented in EIA.

·
Commitment to protect environment, the investor has committed enough 
the contents presented in EIA. However the investor pays attention to put 
the conditions in the contract with the contractors who deliver the 
materials to the construction site and with the HCMC Environment 
Company and dissimenate these commitments to the relating contractors.   
2.2.2   ES requirements of HDP  
Apart from the compliance with the ES requirements of GOV, the 
subproject needs also to comply with the ES requirements of HDP. The item 
2.10 “ES Guideline” of HDP guides to assess the appropriateness via some 
issues that often have the differences between the ES requirements of GOV 
and those of WB such as: 
·
Community consultation and information dissemination; 
·
Investor’s ES implementation capacity;  
·
Risk Management Plan of subproject that had EIA;  
·
Cost for implementing the mitigation measures, environmental 
works and monitoring plan and the investor’s commitments which 
reserves the budget to do these activities. 
 
The detailed assessments are as following: 
™
Community consultation and information dissemination
:
Via 
discussing with officials of the investor, community consultation and 
information dissemination of the subproject were implemented 
completely along with the local proposals in its EIA and it is unnecessary 
repeat. The investor needs to commit to implement the suggestions as the 
feedback of the local community as well as the overall commitment in 
EIA.    
™
The investor’s ES implementation capacity:
 
In EIA the investor has 
presented the estimated cost for the environmental treatment, 
management cost, supervision, the content and the cost for environment 
monitor, personel arrangement to administrate and supervise the 
compliance as presented in EIA. However the investor needs to 
supplement the group for environment supervision in technical 
Department of HNHC beside 2 environment supervisors for each 
package as in EIA. 
™
EMP/RMP (Environment Management Plan-EMP / Risk 
Management Plan-RMP)
:
According to “ES guideline of HDP”, the 
EMP/RMP is a compulsory requirement to comply with the ES 
requirement of HDP. The EMP/RMP needs to be prepared by an investor 
when the investor contacts with HFIC to borrow loan from HDP for a 
subproject. In the relating documents to ES of the subproject of Ha Noi 
Page  16
16
Highway Enlargement Project has EMP . However the investor has to 
supplement and develop this plan as follows:  
1) The articles supervised during the construction time 
·
Supervision of the temporary reservoir of the waste soil, rock 
during the construction time and transportation with covering 
and dispose the regulated area.  
·
Supervision of the dust mitigation measures at the construction 
area, the area for keeping the waste, the mud and the area to 
upload with soil, sand; 
·
Supervision of the implementation the mitigation measures of 
dust from the transportation of the waste materials, soil during 
the construction stage; 
·
Supervision of the implementation the mitigation measures of 
noise and shaking during the construction stage; 
·
Supervision of the implementation the mitigation measures of 
noise and shaking from the trasportation activities during the 
construction stage; 
·
Supervision of the activities of the waste management of the 
contractor including the waste management schedule, training 
and awareness enhancement, report schedule and storage 
location, transportation and waste disposal as stipulated in the 
tender documents and construction contracts;   
·
Supervision of the implementation the mitigation measures of 
the impacts to make the unsafety for the construction and people 
adjacent the construction site not belong to the project;  
·
Supervision of the implementation the mitigation measures of 
the impacts 
to the community’s healthy; 
·
Supervision of the implementation the mitigation measures of 
the impacts by worker gathering;  
·
Supervision of  the cleaning the mud flowing on Ha Noi 
highway;           
·
Supervision of the implementation the mitigation measures of 
the impacts to the traffic safety; and  
·
Supervision of the implementation of the plan to prevent and to 
save the traffic accident by the chemical and harzadous material 
spilling.

2) Monitoring the quality and the air pollution: 
 The Investor need 
to obey the VN air standards during monitoring at the project area 
adjacent to resident (TCVN 5938-2005) and apply VN waste gas in 
transportation (TCVN 5937-2005) to assess the air pollution in 
transportation during monitoring. Beside it must include more the 
monitoring parameters such as CO, NO
x
,
HC with PM10 dust (4 
parameters). 
Beside the locations as presented in EIA it must include some 
sensitive locations such as Sai Gon International University. Brieftly 
the sensitive locations in the HDP project are as follows:  
x
Ky Quang 3 Pagoda (km 0+800) 
x
Medical center of An Phu Ward (km 3+000) 
x
North Rach Chiec Resident area (Km 3+800 
–
Km 4+000) 
x
Tourist Area at Thu Duc District (km 6+500) 
x
Sai Gon International University (km 7+600) 
Frequency (as presented in the approved EIA)  
·
In the construction stage: Every 3 months monitoring 1 time/1 
location during the construction stage. Each time during 24 hours, 
from 6 a.m the day before to 6 a.m the day after, 1 turn of 
monitoring in 02 hours with 3 times. 
·
In the exploitation stage: Monitoring in the first 2 years, 3 months 
monitoring 1 time/1 location. Each time during 24 hours, from 6 
a.m the day before to 6 a.m the day after, 1 turn of monitoring in 02 
hours with 3 times.
 
In the peak construction time and when having the feedback of the 
local government the frequency of the air monitoring will be monthly (
in 
place of 3 months as in EIA
)
.
3) Monitoring of noise and shaking: 
Monitoring of noise and shaking 
obeys the guide of National Environment Monitoring System. 
Apply the Vietnam Standards about the noise for inhabitant area  
(TCVN 5949-1998) and traffic (TCVN 5948-1999) to evaluate the 
noise level created by construction machines and traffic. The 
locations of noise and shaking monitoring are the same with the 
locations of air monitoring.
 
Frequency (as presented in the approved EIA)  
·
In the construction stage: Every 3 months monitoring 1 time/1 
location during the construction stage. Each time during 24 hours, 
from 6 a.m the day before to 6 a.m the day after, 1 turn of 
monitoring in 02 hours with 3 times.

The above cost estimation includes for 3 packages of the HDP subproject. The estimation 
includes only worker cost, analyzing, does not include the other fees as car hiring, 
equipments, rooms, VAT… 
In Brief: 
In the above analysis that shows the ES documents of the 
subproject meet the requirements of GOV and HDP but it has to supplement 
some above articles as well as some commitments of the contractors who 
provide the materials, waste soil transportation.   
 
3.   CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION 
As the above analysis it shows that the subproject of Ha Noi Highway 
Enlargement of HNHC meets the ES requirements of GOV. However to 
borrow the budget from WB via HDP, the subproject needs to comply the ES 
of HDP as mentioned above.
