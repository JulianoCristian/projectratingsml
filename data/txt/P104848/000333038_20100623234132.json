This manual requires that\n            private sector parties who make unsolicited proposals must\n            submit enough details to allow HIFU and the Hochiminh\n            People's Committee (PC) to make a very informed\n            decision on the project. This information is the same that\n            would have been prepared by HIFU and the line departments if\n            the project had been initiated by the PC. In other words,\n            the private sector must meet all the requirements that HIFU\n            shall specify in accordance with this manual so that HIFU\n            can verify and interrogate the information and complete the\n            requirements for the feasibility study. The purpose of this\n            project preparation manual is to provide HIFU with an\n            outline of the various tasks required in the selection,\n            preparation, and management of investment projects as well\n            as providing information on the preparation of feasibility\n            studies and the various appraisal processes.
