                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project is making good progress toward the Project Development Objectives. HFIC (Ho Chi Minh City Financial and Investment State Owned Company) has dealt with the
                         negative impacts of the economic crisis relatively well, and has continued to invest in subprojects and developed its subproject pipeline despite a significant slowdown in private
                         investment in long-term infrastructure. HFIC has reviewed 69 subprojects in various sectors, including the social sectors, and thus far 8 subprojects have passed appraisal and
                         reached loan agreement. The Project has also maintained good leverage of private funding in its portfolio of disbursed subprojects.

                         State Owned Company) and Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee (HCMC PC) reached agreements to change the legal name of the entity from Ho Chi Minh City Investment Fund
                         for Urban Development (HIFU) to Ho Chi Minh City Financial and Investment State Owned Company (HFIC). 2) The World Bank also approved increased flexibility for HFIC between
