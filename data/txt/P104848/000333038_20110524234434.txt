                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER



SUMMARY
The proposed changes will: 1) change the legal name of the entity from Ho Chi Minh
City Investment Fund for Urban Development (HIFU) to Ho Chi Minh Financial
Investment State Owned Company (HFIC); 2) modify allocation of Eligible Expenditure
categories between loan and equity investments; 3) revise Project Outcome Indicators
and Intermediate Results Indicators to reflect the changes in Eligible Expenditure
categories.


PROJECT STATUS
The Project is making good progress toward the PDOs. HIFU has dealt with the negative
impacts of the economic crisis relatively well. Disbursement has been slightly slower
than planned, but HIFU continues to invest and develop its subproject pipeline despite a
significant slowdown in private investment in infrastructure.

The Project originally required that HIFU allocate a certain amount of the IDA credit
toward equity investments, in addition to debt. However, the current economic climate,
among other mitigating factors, including those that have negatively affected project
activity from the private sector, has hindered HIFU’s ability to make such equity
investments; as such no equity investment have yet been made. Allowing HIFU
flexibility to allocate the IDA credit toward loans or equity investments would enable
HDP to be successfully completed within the agreed implementation period. To date,
HIFU has provided loans to 6 subprojects. In the next year, HIFU expects to lend to an
additional 4 subprojects.

HIFU has continued to make significant efforts to identify opportunities to invest in
subprojects across numerous sections, while constantly and consistently consulting with
the WB team during subproject screening and appraisal where needed. In the midst of
the current economic slowdown, HIFU has reviewed 69 subprojects in various sectors, 7
of which have passed appraisal and reached loan agreement—in the wastewater, low-
income housing, and social sectors. The total loan commitment is 560.3 billion VND
(approximately US$ 32.9 million), of which 213.5 billion VND (approximately US$ 12.5
million) has been disbursed. It is also important to note that HDP has been able to
maintain good leverage of private funding, with private/HIFU investment ratio of 1.2 to 1
in the current portfolio of disbursed subprojects.



                                           4
HIFU continues to demonstrate that it is benefitting and developing from the capacity-
building component of HDP, toward establishing the entity as a model LDIF in terms of
policy and procedures, as illustrated in its thorough compliance with the strict financial
covenants to ensuring financial viability and sustainability, the project preparation and
appraisal guidelines, and the established requirements on safeguards, financial
management, and procurement. The increased responsibility and importance of the new
HFIC entity signals the HCMC PC’s further backing of HIFU based on its past success,
including its engagement with WB and performance under the Project.



PROPOSED CHANGES

   •   Institutional arrangements

       The Task team seeks approval of conversion of entity name from Ho Chi Minh
       City Fund for Urban Development (HIFU) to HCMC Financial and Investment
       State Owned Company (HFIC).

       HIFU reported that by Decision dated February 2, 2010, the GOV allowed HCMC
       to convert HIFU to HCMC Financial and Investment State Owned Company
       (HFIC), with additional mandates to cope with the needs of city development.
       The new entity, HFIC, takes on all the responsibilities (including WB
       requirements and expectations vis-à-vis the HDP) while expanding the entity’s
       scope to cover a broader range of investment activities. The change from HIFU
       to HFIC does not change the nature of the WB-assisted project—that is, the
       change does not affect the legal structure and mandate of the entity that the WB
       approved in any way that would jeopardize the implementation of HDP. In fact,
       the increased responsibility and importance of the new entity signals the HCMC
       PC’s further backing of the entity based on its past success, including its
       engagement with WB.

   •   Financing

           o   Reallocations

           The task team seeks approval to allow HIFU flexibility in allocating proceeds
           of the financing between the categories of Eligible Expenditures (Loans and
           Equity Investments)—by amendment to allocation between categories of
           Eligible Expenditures, under Part A (2) of Section IV of Schedule 2 of the FA.

           HIFU has reported reasons for the difficulty in delivering direct (equity)
           investments under the HDP. These include: significant negative impacts of the
           financial crisis on investment activity (projects were delayed or abandoned
           due in large part to a spike in perceived risks and interest rates); the long time
           requirement for processing of infrastructure investments; and a low level of
           comfort among investors in the current climate, especially in light of the lack

                                             5
    of consistent policy guiding competitive selection of investors in Vietnam.
    Given that the time remaining for HDP implementation would be insufficient
    for completion of a direct investment subproject from finalization of
    feasibility study to competitive selection of investor and investment
    implementation the task team supports HIFU’s proposal for using the funding
    allocated under HDP for loans to infrastructure subprojects in partnership with
    private sector.

•   Results/indicators

    In relation to the proposed reallocation of proceeds of the financing between
    categories of Eligible Expenditures (Loans and Equity Investments) as detailed
    above, the task team seeks approval to revise the corresponding Project Outcome
    Indicators and the Intermediate Results Indicators (specifically, those indicators
    that concern debt vs. equity investments). These will be revisions to existing
    indicators only; no indicators would be removed, and no new indicators would be
    added. The two types of modifications proposed are:

       o Indicators that previously broke target values into loans vs. equity
         investments would consolidate those numbers to capture the sum of loans
         and equity investments. These indicators are: PDO Indicators One and
         Two; and Intermediate Results Indicators (under Component 1) One and
         Two.

       o Indicators that specifically concern equity investments would contain new
         language to qualify that the indicator would apply in cases where equity
         investments take place. These indicators are: PDO Indicators Three and
         Six; and Intermediate Results Indicators (under Component 2) Three.

    Annex 1 of this Restructuring Paper details the changes above.
