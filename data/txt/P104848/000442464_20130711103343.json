"versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Ho Chi Minh City\n            Investment Fund for Urban (HIFU) Development Project for\n            Vietnam were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: among the major challenges encountered\n            during project implementation was the difficulty of many\n            prospective private sector investors in complying with the\n            project's safeguard and fiduciary guidelines, which\n            were not fully consistent with Government of Vietnam (GOV)\n            laws and policies. The efforts to move towards adopting\n            country systems for safeguards and fiduciary guidelines\n            should be continued by the Vietnam country team. The lack of\n            specific GOV legal guidelines requiring the competitive\n            selection of private sector partners as part of the\n            establishment of a new legal entity, Special Purpose Vehicle\n            (SPV) served as a disincentive for prospective private\n            investors to participate in direct equity investment\n            sub-projects under HIFU Development Project (HDP). The\n            financing agreement and Project Appraisal Document (PAD) of\n            HDP provided for possible amendments to the project manuals\n            subject to the clearance of the Bank and a resolution of the\n            Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee (HCMC PC). In cases\n            such as HDP where project implementation was affected by the\n            challenges in applying certain guidelines of the project\n            manual, such as those pertaining to procurement and\n            safeguards, the Borrower should be strongly encouraged to\n            review and to formally propose amendments. In the case of\n            HDP where there was an open menu for sub-projects, Ho Chi\n            Minh City Finance and Investment State Owned Company (HFIC)\n            should have been provided with the flexibility to appraise\n            eligible sub-projects in its pipeline on a first-come, first\n            served basis. In the absence of such requirements, the Bank\n            should not have postponed the appraisal of sub-projects from\n            certain sectors in favor of other those from other sectors,\n            particularly in the context where disbursement levels were\n            generally below targets. HFIC generally complied with the\n            financial covenants of the project with the exception of\n            isolated incidents that were a result of directed\n            investments of HCMC PC in sub-projects that were channeled\n            through HFIC. The sequenced preparation and implementation\n            of HDP and Local Development Investment Fund Project (LDIFP)\n            has strategically allowed the Bank to distill and apply\n            lessons from the implementation of HDP to the design and\n            implementation of LDIFP in real-time. In the case of HDP\n            which was implemented in very constrained economic\n            conditions for private sector investors, the strong\n            commitment of HCMC PC and HFIC to promote the project to the\n            investor community, to provide technical assistance to\n            private sector partners in applying the project manual, and\n            to collaborate very closely with the Bank team in\n            continuously developing the pipeline of subprojects and\n            appraising potential sub-projects, were critical in ensuring\n            the achievement of the Project Development Objective (PDO)\n            and the commitment of the full International Development\n            Association (IDA) credit."}, "docdt": "2013-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
