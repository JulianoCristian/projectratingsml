1. INTRODUCTION 
Safety Environment Guide HDP project requires when a sub-project 
had Report of environmental impact assesment (EIA) or commit to 
environmental protection (CEP) even approved the last evaluation report 
found that this did not meet the requirements of HDP ES is the borrower must 
prepare a  risk management plan(RMP). 
 
In this project EIA which was prepared by Ho Chi Minh city joint-
stock Company for Infrastucture Investment (CII) was approved by Ministry 
of Natural Resource and Environment (MONRE) for all the project of Hanoi 
Highway Enlargement from Saigon bridge to Tan Van crossroad. However in 
project implementing CII established the Hanoi Highway Investment and 
Building joint-stock Company (HNHC) which will be the project owner and 
the legal personality to borrow from HDP, so the following evaluation is for 
HNHC.     
Considering the legal documents to be based for the building contract 
signing, there is no EIA and Its Approval Decision, that it means the 
contractors may not know the commitments of the ownwer in enviroment 
protection. 
 
2.  RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Due to not having any standard for risk management plan RMP, 
consultant has proposed the basic content for risk management plan of Hanoi 
Highway Enlargement subproject. The contents of RMP include: 
 (1) Assessment of  the potential risks, mitigation measures and 
performance responsibility.
 
(2) Monitoring plan  
 (3) Estimated cost of monitoring/inspection 
 (4) Propose the ability enhancement program 
 (5) Internal monitoring/ inspection report
.
presented in turn below:  
2.1. Risk assessment, mitigation measures and implementation duties 
 
Considering the approved EIA contents and the contracts for building 
contract packages 1,2 and 3, the following comments are:  
·
As presented above EIA was approved in on June/2009 but it was not 
concerned in the legal documents based for contract signing. However 
in the contracts the articles “Contractor’s Interests and Duties” 
(contract packages 1 and 3 item 10.11, contract package 2 item 9.12, 
highlight “
The contractors must implement the environment protection 
Page  3
3
measures in EIA approved by MONRE in the Decision No. 
1071/Q
-
BTNMT dated 11 June 2009
). Propose the owner provide the EIA 
document for contractor refer to realize.   
·
Discussing with the project investor, in the contracting documents 
having the item to force the contractor calculate the tent cost in the 
contracting price. With this cost, the contractor has the responsibility to 
hire the site for tent building up to the site for constructing.  
·
In the contract signed between the owner and the contractors having the 
safety item, contracting package 1(item 10.6), 2(item 9.6) and 3(item 
10.6) stipulate the Contractors must comply all the labor safety 
regulations. Ensure to have the fence, lighting for working site 
protection until the completeness and transfer to the owner. The 
Contractor must do the temporary works (roads, walking roads, 
guardrooms and fences) necessary for building, protect the people  and 
the owners and residents in the sites next to the project work. The 
works will be inspected by the owner inspecting consultants and 
confirmed before executing. In the case of the contractor not comply as 
the owner inspecting consultants’ report or admistrative agency or 
traffic participants the owner will hire the 3
rd
 part implementing and the 
cost will be deducted in their contract cost. The contractors will be 
responsible for all the labor accidents and traffic accidents relating the 
work. Labor employing the contractor will be responsible to relate with 
the functional agencies (insurance…) to compensate properly the 
victim to overcome the consequence.    
·
Before to deploy the building the contractors must prepare the plan of 
traffic regulating as presented in the project (including the human 
arrangement) to be approved by specialized agencies before working. 
Briefly by contract the owner will tie the contractor to comply the items 
of labor safety, taffic safety in the working site as the state standards. 
·
In material transportation to the site the owner compels the contractors 
(via contracts) must use the main route is Ha Noi Highway. Actually, in 
project building, the design consultant company surveyed the material 
mine (region) used for the project in Binh Duong and Dong Nai 
Provinces and the owner had approved. It is compulsory that the unique 
route is the Sai gon river and Dong Nai river and Ha Noi Highway to 
the construction site. It is also that in the construction site region it has 
only the Ha Noi Highway which is able responsible for high load 
transportation, nearest distance and most economical efficiency.  
·
In the construction contracts do not concern that the transportation 
contractors from the delivery to the construction site have to protect the 
environment along the transportation route. Therefore the owner 
Page  4
4
requires and force the contractors have to cover fully during 
transportation which may cause the dust. When the trucks arrive the 
construction site the owner inspector will control with the writing down 
the truck number and its situations. 
If the owner’s enviroment 
consultants, inhabitants or local officer have comments, the 
transportation contractors must be responsible and have the measures to 
overcome on time. In the case of the contractors do not overcome on 
time following to the inspection consultant’s report or from the 
reflection of administrative agencies or the drivers the owner will hire 
the other company  (the 3
rd
 party) perform to overcome and the cost for 
it will be deducted into the value of the contractor’s contract.   
·
Following to EIA the investor will sign with the HCNC Environment 
Company the contract to transport the waste materials to Hoc Mon. 
However in tender requirements this work had been calculated into the 
cost of tender package and the contractor will have to realize as EIA.  
·
During the construction stage EIA proposed to install the steel fence 
covered with steel sheet in 2m high in order to isolate the construction 
site with the traffic road and limit the dust emission, noise and prevent 
the accident of workers and the traffic participants. The investor will 
pay the cost of fence and it was included the tender price and the 
contractor will implement right as in the tender document. If the 
contractors do not implement completely or not safe and technical 
conditions, the owner will hire the 3
rd
 party to implement this work and 
the cost paid will be deducted in the value of the contract. However it is 
necessary that the investor’s consultant needs to inspect the firmness of 
the fence and repair on time when it has disproportion by collision, 
especially in the rainy season.  
·
The cost for environment hygien protection in the construction site and 
workers’ tent, dust prevention by watering, site cleaning up after 
construction completeness… has been added in the tender price. The 
number of watering is up to the daily weather and as the inspection 
consultant’s requirement to prevent the negative impact to the 
environment. The owner and the specialized administrative agencies 
direct the inspection consultants check carefully. If the contractors do 
not implement completely as consultant’s requirements the owner and 
the specialized administrative agencies or the inhabitants, the traffic 
participants comment the owner will hire the 3
rd
 party to implement this 
work and the cost paid for the 3
rd
 party will be deducted into the 
contract value.

However in the estimated budget for the air monitoring which 
calculated the cost for only monitoring of 3 parameters such as dust PM10, 
CO and HC. The investor needs to comply Vietnam air standards during 
monitoring at the project areas adjacent to resident area (TCVN 5938-2005) 
and comply the traffic waste gas (TCVN 5937-2005) io assess the pollution 
during the traffic waste gas monitoring. Therefore it needs to monitor more 
parameter NO

The above estimated budget is for all 3 tender packages in HDP loan project. It 
calculated only for monitoring workers, sample analyzing, it does not include car hire, 
equipments, rent room for workers and VAT tax. 
2.3.  Suggestion the strengthening program  
 
In EIA the investor has presented completely the human resource for 
environment protection. Because the investor has established the subcompany 
whichis HNHC to realize the project and the manpower for HNHC are 
transferred from CII to HNHC that it is unnecessary to strengthen the 
capacity. However to ensure the follow of environment safety implementation 
for the subproject the investor must establish the specialized team with at least 
1
environment engineer in the technical department  of HNHC and 
disseminate the contents of environment protection to the contractors, 
construction units to comply the regulations in the law of environment 
protection, meet the requirements of the environment protection standards as 
EIA  presented. Specifically are as follows:  
·
Realize the commitments of the investor as stated in the approved 
EIA; 
·
Executing the inspection, checking and report regime in 
environment protection under the supervision 
of the investor’s 
environment officer.  
·
Coordinating with the local government at the construction site and 
along the transportation road to treat the arising problems.   
2.4.   Internal monitoring reports 
After participating HDP and put the project into operation, the investor 
of project is HNHC has to report periodically about the RMP implementation 
to HFIC. Based on the report, HFIC synthesizes with other subprojects to 
submit to WB. The reporting will be terminated after MONRE issues the 
approval of project. The internal monitoring reports in Vietnamese should be 
done every three months during the construction stage  and every six months 
after approved by MONRE in the first 2 years and submitting all reports to 
HFIC. The contents of internal reports could be referred to “Environmental 
Safeguard Guideline” of HDP. 
2.5   RMP implementation monitoring carried out by specialists of WB 
and HFIC 
Apart from internal monitoring is carried out by the investor, the 
subproject belongs to the pilot program of HFIC, therefore it will be 
supervised closely by WB and HFIC. Monitoring schedule of EMP/RMP 
Page  10
10
implementation will be informed beforehand by HFIC to the investor. The 
contents of supervision are mainly the assessment of level of compliance of 
EMP/RMP which approved by all sides. 
2.6   Responsibility to implement the RMP 
As soon as all sides approve the RMP, the investor is responsible for 
(1) Publicizing the RMP to the relating contractors; 
(2)  Implementing all contents stated in the RMP.
