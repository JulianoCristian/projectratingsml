                         to extend key infrastructure services of adequate quality standards that meet the needs of communities where infrastructure was damaged by the tsunami of
                         2004 and the subsequent earthquake.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The overall progress and quality of the project is good. Fifty-two infrastructure reconstruction sub-projects have already been completed in sectors such as water supply, roads, ports,
                         and drainage and flood control. The assets of completed sub-projects have been successfully transferred to the authorities responsible for their ongoing operation and maintenance.
                         The project has helped foster economic growth in Aceh and North Sumatra by improving connectivity via the roads and ports that facilitate movement of people and goods.
                         Reconstruction work is still underway on a 50 km section of Aceh'➂ s west coast road

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Status of unfinished reconstruction work under the project Additional Financing Grant (TF098082) will be reviewed to determine the need for a short extension of the closing date. The
                         next implementation support mission is scheduled to take place in March 2012.
