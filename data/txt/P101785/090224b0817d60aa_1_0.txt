                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the Project is to assist the Province of Aceh and 12 Local Governments in Aceh and Nias to reconstruct/rehabilitate strategic infrastructure and to
                         extend key infrastructure services of adequate quality standards that meet the needs of communities where infrastructure was damaged by the tsunami of 2004 and the
                         subsequent earthquake.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The overall progress and quality of the project is good. Fifty-two infrastructure reconstruction sub-projects have already been completed in sectors including water supply, roads,
                         ports, and drainage and flood control. The assets of completed sub-projects have been successfully transferred to the authorities responsible for their ongoing operation and
                         maintenance. The project has helped foster economic growth in Aceh and North Sumatra by improving connectivity via the roads and ports that facilitate movement of people and
                         goods. Reconstruction work is ongoing on a 50 km section of Aceh's west coast road from Calang to Meulaboh including Kuala Bubun bridge.
