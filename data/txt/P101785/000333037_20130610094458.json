Some lessons learned included: the\n            scope of the devastation caused by the tsunami, the size of\n            the reconstruction program and the specificities of the\n            historical institutional relationship between Aceh province\n            and the central government meant that achieving the right\n            implementation management for the recovery efforts was not a\n            given and that the reconstruction process will not be as\n            effective due to their weak capacity and the complexity of\n            the central government bureaucracy. Careful attention should\n            be provided to ensure the preparedness of local governments\n            to handle the assets, budgetary space for funding of\n            maintenance activities, existing capacity in infrastructure\n            management within local governments, and adequate status of\n            assets. The project is a successful example of stakeholder\n            participation and commitment, which led for instance to the\n            satisfactory design of the sub-projects priority list and\n            the support of the various authorities to facilitate and\n            safeguard project implementation.
