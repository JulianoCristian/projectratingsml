increase\n            agricultural production and farmers' incomes. This will\n            be achieved through the development of a tertiary\n            distribution system, the establishment of an operation and\n            maintenance service for the Marib Flood Control/Irrigation\n            Scheme, and the strengthening of agricultural support\n            services in the area. The project also aims at establishing\n            a strong institutional framework for addressing the longer\n            term agricultural development needs of the Eastern Region,\n            through the strengthening of ERADA (Eastern Region\n            Agricultural Development Authority) and the augmenting of\n            agricultural research. The project will provide to these\n            services and institutions: development facilities in the\n            form of technical staff, staff training, expert/consultant\n            services, tertiary canals, buildings, vehicles and\n            equipment. Also, the project will provide, through farmer\n            participation, investments needed for on-farm development."}, "docdt": "1988-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
