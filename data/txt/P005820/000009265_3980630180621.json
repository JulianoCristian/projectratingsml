Some of the lessons learned from the project\n            are: (i) in hardship areas, the early construction of staff\n            housing and the provision of special allowances are\n            necessary to motivate and attract qualified staff; (ii)\n            extension subject matter specialists (SMSs) should be\n            exposed to new technologies early on while they are being\n            developed or verified by researchers; (iii) success of the\n            technical assistance (TA) components can achieved when,\n            inter alia, a favorable environment for good performance is\n            created; (iv) early training and institutional building\n            helps in the achievement of project objectives; and (v) in\n            retrospect, the Abu Dhabi fund pullout had the unintended\n            benefit of allowing the empowerment of farmers to construct,\n            operate and maintain with Eastern Region Agricultural\n            Development Authority (ERADA's) assistance the earthen\n            tertiary canals, which were supposed to be constructed by\n            the project."}, "docdt": "1998-05-21T00:00:00Z"}
