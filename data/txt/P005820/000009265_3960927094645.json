The project will provide to these\n            services and institutions: development facilities in the\n            form of technical staff, staff training, expert/consultant\n            services, tertiary canals, buildings, vehicles and\n            equipment. Also, the project will provide, through farmer\n            participation, investments needed for on-farm development."}, "docdt": "1988-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
