{"cdata!": "The purpose of the Second Calcutta Urban\n            Development Project is to expand and upgrade the\n            capabilities of the administrative authorities in the\n            Calcutta Metropolitan District (CMD), to strengthen the\n            CMD's fiscal base, and to extend and rehabilitate the\n            city's urban service systems, particularly those of\n            critical importance to the urban poor. To accomplish this,\n            the project includes a program of organizational,\n            managerial, and fiscal reform for the CMD's\n            administrative agencies as well as a technical assistance\n            and service program including area development and slum\n            improvement schemes serving about 900,000 of the city's\n            poor; extensive improvements to the CMD's water supply,\n            sewerage and sanitation facilities; and a pilot health\n            program serving about 175,000 low-income people. The project\n            also includes measures to rehabilitate the system of solid\n            waste management in the CMD, the provision of credit and\n            expanded extension services to about 4,800 very small\n            enterprises, traffic and transportation improvements, and\n            construction or remodelling of 440 primary schools, mostly\n            in slum areas."}, "docdt": "1977-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
