PROJECT COMPLETION REPCRT
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AND EXP(RT PROMOTION PROJECT
Loan 1813-BAR
PREFACE
This document describes and assesses the design, implementation and
impact of a US10 million Wcrld Bank loan extended in 1980 to the
Government of Barbados in support of increased industrial output (destined
for both domestic and export markets) and efforts to strengthen
institutions assisting the Barbadian manufacturing sector. Loan proceeds
'were allocated among four project participants as follows: USS6.000
million (USS5.159 million ultimately disbursed) to the Barbados Industrial
Development Corporation (BIDC) for construction of industrial estates,
offshore promotional activities and technical assistance; US$3.200 million
(USS3.139 million ultimately disbursed) to the Barbados Development Bank
(BDB) for industrial subprojects and technical assistance; USS0.300 million
(US40.241 million ultimately disbursed) to the Export Promotion Corporation
for establishing a program of directed support to BarbadiRi% exporters and
for technical assistance, and US$0.500 milliorn (US$O.300 million ultimately
disbursed) to the Barbados Institute for Management and Productivity
(BLMAP) for developing training materials and technical assistancb and to
the National Training Board (NTB). The project, which experienced initial
implementation delays due to institutional difficulties and, later on,
reduced demand due to the 1983-85 regional and local recession, was
completed in March 198b, two years later than appraisal projections. Final
disbursements totalled US$8.849 million and the unused balance ,f US$1.151
million was cancelled April lb, 1986.
This report is based on research and analysis of Bank documents and
information provided by the Borrower and gathered during the project
completion mission in March 1987.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED), but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft report
to the Borrower for comments. These comments have be-en taken into account
in finalizing the report and are reproduced in Annex 11.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AND EXPORT PROMOTION PROJECT
LN. 1813-BAR
Highlights
1.       The Industrial Development and Export Promotion project was the
Bank's initial assistance to the industrial sector of Barbados. The Loan
was approved on April 28, 1980 and closed one year after the original
Closing Date (September 1984). The project included the following four
components: financing for the construction of factory buildings. in new or
existing industrial estates managed by Barbados Industrial Development
Corporation (BIDC); technical assistance funds for the export promotion
activities of BIDC and the Barbados Export Promotion Corporation (BEPC);
support for the business management and vocational training activities of
the Barbados Institute of Management and Productivity (BIHAP) and the
National Trainining Board (NTB); and, finally, a line-of-credit and
technical assistance to the Barbados Development Bank (BDB) for onlending
to viable import-substituting and exporting industrial firms (para. 1.01).
2.       The project was designed to provide a much needed boost to the
share of the industrial sector in the economy; in 1979, this share stood at
only 11.31 of GDP. The broad 4evelopment strategy pursued under the proj-
ect was to facilitate industrial investment with adequate term financing,
readily available physical infrastructure, and improved productivity
through vocational training. However, project implementation was affected
adversely by the downturn in the Barbadian economy, caused in the main by
the external recession; the collapse of the CARICOM market; and the loss of
export competitiveness, owing to the close relationship between the
overvalued US and Barbados dollars (para. 1.02).
3.       Since Ln. 1813-BAR was the first Bank industrial project in
Barbados, fundamental changes to the operating policies of the partici-
pating institutions were required. Above all, the fact that several agen-
cies were involved made the implementing arrangements quite complex and
difficult to monitor (para. 2.05). The procedural problems were further
complicated by the lack of working capital for the three technical assist-
ance entities, namely, BEPC, NITB and BIHAP (para. 2.08). The net result
of the delays was that, two years after implementation, the disbursements
lagged appraisal estimates by almost 70Z. But, just when the project began
to pick up momentum, disbursement rates suffered further, due to the effect
of the Government's austerity program, which included a budget cut for
BIDC's building program. The Bank supervision missions carried out an in-
depth review of the implementation problems and made sound proposals to
expedite project execution. As a result, both the commitment and disburse-
ment rates improved rapidly, even though it was becoming quite clear that
the factory building program tar6ets would not be achieved because of
faltering demand for new industrial space (paras. 2.09-2.11).



4.       The project impact on improving the financial operation of the
participating institutions, namely, BIDC and BDB, was minimal. With BIDC,
the crucial element was the dounturn in demand for industrial space, but
the underlying cause of weak performance was the issue of rental rates.
This issue in fact strained BanklBIDC relations, since there was a diver-
gence of views whether BIDC's financial viability and cost recovery were
medium- or long-term objectives. During implementation, BIDC's incentive
if any to charge economic rents was further diluted by the slack in eco-
nomic activity. In hindsight, the Bank's appraisal targets about occupancy
rates and virtually no rental arrears also proved optimistic. A major
lesson from the BIDC implementation is that a factory construction program
should be executed on a phased basis, and expansion undertaken as demand at
full price materializes. BIDC's institution-building aspect developed much
better, despite the operating and program implementation problems expe-
rienced (paras. 3.03-3.06). The project had a salutory effect on BIDC's
construction practices, project management skills, and cost-effective use
of SSE contractors engaged in constructing standard factory shells.
5.       There was only marginal success with BDB's financial operations,
as well as its institution building objectives (paraf  3.10-3.14).  BDB's
financial strength was rapidly eroded by its arrears snd by its losses due
to the foreign exchange risk under a previous IDB Loan. Moreover, its
operating spread remained narrow and did not cover any unforeseen financial
shocks (para. 3.12). The impact of BDB's lending at the subproject level
has been mixed: while the credits were given to a fairly large number of
clients, including SME's, the subloans were concentrated in two major sub-
sectors--and more than half were in Bridgetown (para. 3.14). The employ-
ment impact of investments also fell short of appraisal targets, and a high
proportion of the loans are now in arrears. BIDB's institutional capacity
to appraise and supervise sound investment projects remained weak; tech-
nical assistance under the project was not used to ameliorate these prob-
lems (para. 3.13). An important implementation lesson which emerges from
this first experience with BDB is that critical factors affecting project
implementation, such as action on arrears and decisions on the treatment of
foreign exchange risks in general, need to be discussed up front and, if
necessary, be made a condition of Board presentation, instead of being left
for resolution during implementation.
6.       BEPC was a nascent institution at the time of Appraisal., and took
one-and-a-half years after loan effectiveness to become operational (paras.
3.16-3.17).  Almost half the project resources earmarked for BEPC were
spent on activities outside the country, and no statistical evidence is
available to evaluate the direct impact of BEPC activities on Barbadian
exports.  BEPC's efforts were stymied to some extent by the rigorous per-
formance standards of extraregional markets, especially given the rela-
tively poor quality of Barbadian exportables and the lack of product range.
While it has taken several years for BEPC to establish its reputation with
the local businessmen, it it now equipped to provide more effective assist-
ance to Barbadian exporters. The project's smallest component, namely
assistance for the training activities of BIHAP and NTB, was quite success-
ful inspite of the severe counterpart funding problems (para. 3.20). The
teaching aids developed by these institutions under the project have had a
substantial impact on both the effectiveness and continous growth of
BlMAP's training activities (para. 3.21). In addition, the computer equip-



-vi-
ment and related software development financed under the project has
enabled BIMAP to introduce very useful training modules.
7.       Overall, the project achieved its broad objective of assisting in
the establishment of a nascent export promotion agency, which widened its
operations both within the country and overseas. Similarly, the financial
assistance to BIDC helped lay the foundation for improved tendering proce-
dures, development of small contracting industries and management skills.
The limited assistance zo BUMAP also had a positive impact on its training
quality and enhanced the image of the institution amongst private sector
clients. The quantitative targets of the project, however, fell substan-
tially behind Appraisal estimates, both with regard to industrial buildings
and credit components. Aside from the reasons enumerated above, one major
factor affecting project performance wa- the adverse macroeconomic
environment in which the project was implemented (para. 1.05).
8.       The comments of BEPC (Annex 11) to the initial draft of this
Report have been reflected in appropriate modifications to paras. 3.16 and
3.18 in pp. 15 and 16.

I. Introduction
1.01      Project Description  On April 28, 1980 the World Bank approved a
US$10.0 million loan (Loan 1813-BAK) in support of the Government of Barbados'
(GOB) 1978-82 Industrial Development Plan, which focused on expansion and
diversification of industrial output and exports, job creation and strengtheniag
of the main institutions responsible for promoting industrial development in
Barbados. The interest rate was 8.25% p.a., and the loan was repayable in 15
years, including 3 years grace period. The foreign exchange component of the
US$21.9 million project was met by the Bank loan and a parallel Caribbean
Development Bank (CUB) loan (US$2.5 million)j/; the GOB financed the remaining
local currency costs. The Bank loan was composed of four components: US$6.0
million was allocated to the Barbados Industrial Development Corporation (BIDC)
for financing factory shell construction in new and existing industrial estates
(US$5.0 million), overseas investment promotion acti.ities (US$0.6 million) and
technical assistance (US§0.4 million); US$3.2 million was allocated to the
Barbados Development Bank (BDB) to support its industrial lending program
(US43.000 million) and technical assistance (USS0.2 million); US$0.3 million was
provided to support the establishment and operations of the Export Promotion
Corporation (EPC), and US$0.5 million was to be shared equally between the
Barbados Institute for Management and Productivity (BIMAP) and the National
Training Board (NTI) in support of their business management and vocational
training activities. The project, which constituted the bank's initial
involvement with the Barbadian industrial sector, was not repeated upon
completion: a subsequent Bank Industrial Credit Loan (Loan 2260-BAR), which
became effective in July 1983, was a two-tier lending program focused equally on
financial and industrial sector issues.
1.02      Overall Context   Barbados, a small island (431 square kilometers)
situated at the south-easternmost extremity of the Caribbean island archipelago,
experienced a strong 5% GDP average aumal growth from mid-1960 to the end of
the 1970s on the strength of fiscal and industrial policies designed to broaden
output from a single traditional crop, sugar, to a more diversified economy
based on tourism and manufacturing. These policies met with success: by the
beginning of the 1980s agriculture, tourism and manufacturing together directly
contributed some one-third of the national product in roughly equal shares.
Barbados enjoys high levele of literacy, a relatively equitable income
distribution and generally &ood standards of health, education, social services
and basic infrastructure. These accomplishments are notable given that the
local resource endowment is limited, that political institutions are relatively
young (independence from Britain was achieved in 1966) and that rates of natural
ji According to CDB records.

increase have created high population densities (584 persons per sq. km.). Much
of Barbados' progress can be traced to its outward-looking economic development
strategy, a general reliance on market forces, political and social stability
and a judicious balance between the roles of the public (G,OB) and the private
sectors.
1.03           Manufacturing and Export Sectors  The Barbadian manufacturing
sector is dominated by consumer goods (food and beverage products, tobacco,
clothing and furniture), by its overall small-scale nature (averaging 50
employees per firm in 1977), and by larger, foreign-owned assembly-type plants
producing garments and electronic components for export markets.-9 Industrial
development has been shaped by incentive policies enabling virtually all
enterprises to import and export duty-free and without restrictions and by
tariff protection afforded through Barbados' participation in the CARICOM Common
External Tariff (CET). Provision of factory buildings in industrial estates,
sponsored by the GOB through BIDC, also played a prominent role in Barbados'
rapid industrialization throughout the 19609 and 1970s: over this twenty-year
period BIDC constructed over 1 million sq. ft. of factory space in nine
industrial parks where, at the time of Loan 1813-BAR appraisal, more than 5000
workers (one-third of the manufacturing workforce) were employed. Many
foreign-owned firms established productive activities within these industr:.al
estates, motivated by the range of amenities, the convenience and the subsidized
rents provided therein.3/
1.04      The industrial sector grew at about 6% per annum between 1970-79,
principally througa direct foreign investment in assembly operations:
nevertheless, at the time of Loan 1813-BAR appraisal (1979) manufacturing still
provided only 11.3% of GDP (which totalled US$468.6 million in 1978) and about
16% of total employment. *   lanufactured exports rose more than four-fold between
1970-78 (from BUS$25.6 million in 1970 to BUS$120 million in 1978), and their
share in total domestic merchandise exports increased from 41% to 64Z during
this period (Annex 3). Most of this dynamic growth was due to rapid expansion
within the garment and electronic component industrial subsectors. The
direction of trade for Barbados' manufactured exports is a function of either
the home country of foreign enclave industries or Barbados' links to regional
markets through CAKICOM, and over the past decade these trade relationships have
shifted markedly.   At the time of Loan Appraisal, for example, approximately
3bZ of Barbados' exports went to the United States, 25% was shipped to trading
partners within CARICOM and almost 20% went to EEC markets: in 1985, by
contrast, CARICOM countries received 23% of Barbados' exports, the United States
purchased 18% of the total, and the EEC imported only 7%.4/
1.05       Hacroeconomic Context The overall thrust of the 1978-82 Industrial
Development Plan was to strengthen, diversify and expand Barbados' industrial
9f These offshore operations in 1979 provided 70% of industrial employment and
generated about 80% of industrial exports.
/ Rents and purchase prices of factory space in the industrial estates were,
previous to Loan 1813-BAR, lower than or equivalent to market rates for
caparable facilities throughout the Caribbean region.

sector which would, in turn, ameliorate rising unemployment (which had peaked at
22% in 1975),5/ build upon the existing development strategy, and contribute to
gross and per capita output. Loan 1813-BAR was specifically designed to
increase industrial output through new foreign and local investment (BIDC and
BDB components) and to address perceived needs6/ within the Barbados industrial
sector (EPC, BIMAP and NTB components). The outcome of project-related
activities initiated under the BIDC and the BDB components depended in
substantial part on prevailing macroeconomic conditions, which deteriorated
during loan implementation due to (i) the 1981-83 recession in the
industrialized economies (which precipitated a domestic recession), (ii) the
collapse of the CARICOM market (and the resulting domestic recession that lasted
from mid-1983 to 1985), and (iii) the close relationship of the Barbados dollar
to the overvalued US dollar (which reduced Barbados' export competitiveness
vis-a-vis other countries). Between 1980 and 1985 average industrial production
per annum fell from BDS$147.5 million to BDSS100.6 million (in constant terms),
investment as a percentage of GDP fell from 25% to 15%, and unemployment rose
from 12X to 19X (Annex 2).  Merchandise exports leaped from BDS$202 million in
1980 to BDSS502 million in 1984 before falling to BDS$422 million in 1985. Most
of this growth was due to a spectacular rise in electronic components (which
rose from 31% of total manufactured exports in 1980 to 72% of manufactured
exports in 1985) at the expense of virtually all other domestic manufactured
exports.7/ Incipient structural adjustment in the electronics and garment
subsectors (due in part to the oversaturated global semiconductor market and
Barbados' escalating real wage rates) is presently creating employment and
output attrition and contraction.
II.  The Project
A. Description
2.01      Loan Objectives  The objectives of Loan 1813-BAR were to:
(a) expand industrial output and exports;
(b) generate increasing levels of employment; and
(c) strengthen the main institutions responsible for promoting industrial
development in Barbados.
2.02      At the outset of project implementation Bank monies were scheduled to
finance (i) the construction costs of 35 factory buildings in four (three
The manufacturing sector was perceived as a potential source of
cost-effective employment (having supplied one-third of the 10,000
additional jobs created between 1970 and 1979).

more economic plant size, improve product quality and production
efficiencies, and broaden both their export product mix and export market
reach.

over the relevant period (Annex 3).

existing and one new) Industrial estates; (ii) promotional expenses related to
industrial estate expansion; (iii) approximately 30 industrial subprojects
through the BDB; (iv) manufactured exports promotion, design and marketing; (v)
business management and vocational training, and (vi) consolidation and
strengthening of tth institutions serving the industrial sector.
2.03      Special Loan Terms  Loan proceeds were distributed according to two
arrangements: EPC, BLMAP and NIB were directly reimbursed by the GOB for
project-related expenditures approved by the World Bank, while BIDC and BD-
established subsidiary loan agreements with GOB against which disbursements were
effected once Bank approval had been secured.!/ Specific terms and conditions
of the Loan Agreement governing the operations of BUB and BIDC were as follows:
(a)  BIDC   So as to ensure that BLDC would recover real capital costs and
achieve positive net Income by FY 1983-84, a new pricing policy based
on actual construction and operating expenditures was established that
set (1) anwual rects at 14X of construction costs for new applicants
(7X for small-scale enterprises) with step Increases on contract
renewals for existing clients uctil parity with new building rental
rates was achieved; (1i) annual rentals on leases with option to
purchase contracts at 10-151 above the rental level defined above;
(iii) the option price for lease purchase contracts as a function of
actual replacement cost or fair market value and discounted
accordingly, and (iv) rental and lease contracts at three and five
year maturities, respectively, with provision for inflation adjustment
at the time of renewal.
(b)  5DB  Subloans granted by BDB were dot to exceed the maturity of BDB's
subsidiary loan agrement and were to be onlent at 1 p.a. plus a
flat service fee of 1X and a commitment fee of 1Z on undisbursed
amounts. BDB lending rates were to be periodically adjusted to
reflect current and projected inflation and changes in the cost of
IDB's resources.
2.04      Bank review of BIDC and BDB project-related activities was subject to
free limits once the first three BIDC construction contzacts and the first five
BUB industrial subloans were reviewed and approved. These limits varied to
reflect differences in project sizes, the possibility of conflict of interests
and the appraisal and Implementation capabilities of project participants.
Free limits were defined as follows:
(a) BIDC All Bank financed construction contracts were subject to prior
review and approval by the GOB Tenders Committee and contracts
awarded to BIDC's construction division exceeding US$350,000 were also
subject to World Bank prior review and approval.
(b) BDB Subproject free limits were set at US$150,000 and economic rate
of return calculations were to be calculated on all subprojects above
the free limit.
"/ On-lending terms to BIDC were 15 years including 3 years grace at 10% per
annum, while BOB on-lending terms were identical to the terms of the Bank
loan to the Goverment. The Borrower was to absorb the foreign exchange
risk.

2.05      Loan Covenants/Conditions  Due to the fact that Loan 1813-BAR was the
first Bank industrial project in Barbados, that fundamental changes to operating
policies were required of major project participants, and that the Project was
sufficiently complex in terms of scope and institutional arrangements, numerous
agreements were reached during negotiations between the Bank and the GOB (acting
both for its own account and as fiduciary for EFC, NTB and BI14AP), the Bank and
BIDC, and the Bank and BDB. Specific performance requirements are detailed as
follows:
(a)  GOB   The GOB agreed (by the referenced date) to:  recruit EPC's
airector General (by September 30, 1980); approve a restructuring of
BOB's Board and an increase in authorized capital, approve a plan and
timetable for increasing BDB staff and revising its salary structure,
organize and staff EPC (by December 31, 1980), and carry out a study
of the structure of interest rates in Barbados and appropriate policy
measures (by August 31, 1980).
(b) BIDC BIDC agreed to: prepare plans relating to (i) increasing the
participation of smaller contractors on construction and engineering
contracts and (ii) the utilization of Bank funds for promotion,
technical assistance and staff training (by Sept. 30, 1980); and adopt
a revised accounting system (by March 31, 1981).9/
(c)  BDB  BDB agreed to:  prepare a plan ard timetable for increasing BDB
staff and revising its salary structure (by June 30, 1980);  prepare a
plan for (i) portfolio recuperation (including exercising guarantees
and writing off bad debts) and (ii) staff training programs and use of
Bank technical assistance funds (by Sept. 30, 1980); fill then-vacant
positions of Financial Comptroller and Manager of Operations with
qualified candidates, and revise BOB's statement of Policies and
Procedures (i.e. providing for a 5:1 debt/equity ratio, the procedure
for reviewing lending rates and on-lending terms for subloans).
B. Implementation
2.06      General  Loan 1813-BAR was approved on March 3, 1980 and became
effective on August 28, 1980, four months later than originally scheduled due to
delayed receipt of relevant legal documents. The Project's initial hurdle was
completion of the interest rate study (stipulated in a side letter to the Loan
Agreement), which was to be canpleted by August 1980 and used as the basis for
determining BDB on-lending rates: the study (delayed by staff constraints at
the Central Bank) was completed by March 1981 and BDB lending and BIDC rental
rates were adjusted accordingly.
2.U7       Prompt submission of and compliance with the terms of Loan conditions
by participating institutions (see para. 2.05) proved to be difficult:
the Banit agreed in December 1980 to extend final compliance dates to March 31,
1981 for BDB (regarding its plans for reorganization, salary structure
adjustments, and reducing arrears), BIDC (concerning its plans for increasing
/ BIDC's Board approved the new rental pricing policy (see para 2.03 (a)) on
January 17, 1980, approximately one month before loan negotiations took
place.

SSE contractor participation and its staff training ptogram), and GOB (regarding
the appointment of a Director General for EPC). By December 1980 only BDB had
submitted all required programs and documents and the Bank had approved the
first five subprojects: thereafter BDB subproject approvals and disbursements
proceeded at a rate that exceeded appraisal estimates. BIDC revised its
start-up schedule for Bank-financed construction to February 1981 after
experiencing delays caused by (i) unfamiliar and complex prequalification
procedures (for construction companies bidding on prospective contracts) and
(ii) a change of project managers.  By January 1981 BIDC had devised a plan to
disaggregate construction contracts so as to encourage SSE contractor
participation, and within three months BIDC had complied with all other
outstanding Loan Commitment terms. BIMAP submitted its technical assistance
financing plan to the Bank by December 1980, but NTB and SPC were unable to
submit similar documentation until July 1981 due to administrative and
procedural inefficiencies (both of these implementing agencies had been created
just prior to Loan Appraisal and suffered from inadequate staff, funding,
organization and management). The Loan disbursement schedule was revised
downwards to reflect the slow start experienced by most implementing agencies
(BDB constituting the sole exception).
2.U8       Further operational problems surfaced in July 1981 when the Bank
notified the GOB that disbursements by EPC, NTB and B1IAP for eligible
expenditures under the Project were hampered by working capital constraints,
which prevented these agencies from providirg the up-front financirg against
which the bank -- through GOB -- disbursed Loan 1813-BAR monies. The Bank's
request for additional budgetary allocations or alternative bridge financirg
arrangements was not promptly acted upon by the GOB. This problem, in
conjunction with the aforementioned administrative delays and frequent changes
in priorities experienced within BIDC, NTB, BIMAP and EPC, contributed to slower
Loan disbursements: by June 30, 1982 disbursements lagged appraisal projections
by 69%10/ (USS5.8 million projected vs. US$1.8 million actually disbursed).
Further disbursement difficulties arose in late 1982, when the CARICOM market's
collapse and concomitant regional economic contraction began to affect trade and
industry and, in derivative fashion, national liquidity. The GOB adopted an
economic austerity program that forced cutbacks in BIDC's budgetary allocation
(which, originally established at BD$9 million for FY 1982/83, was revised to
BDS$5 million before it was ultimately raised -- after Bank intervention -- to
BUS$7 million), and local demand for factory space began to falter. By July
1982 BDB had fully committed its credit component, while BIDC had committed only
50% of its allotment and EPC, NTB and BIMAP had yet to register a commitment
under the Loan.
2.09      EPC and BIMAP succeeded in reversing this trend in mid-1983, when EPC
launched its first export promotion project (summer lawn furniture) and BIMAP
completed construction of its new headquarters (offices and classrooms). BIDC
continued its factory shell construction program (substituting the new Spring
Garden estate - tailored to the needs of domestic furniture producers - for
the proposed Speightstown facility), but working capital constraints (see para.
2.08) and weaker domestic demand induced by the local recession (which began to
generate higher client arrears and increased inventories of unoccupied space)
10/ Most disbursements as of this date stemmed from BDB industrial lending
activities.

began to affect prospects for fully disbursing BIDC's loan component. In June
1983 the GUB first requested an extension of the loan commitment and closing
dates to September 31, 1984 and June 30, 1985, respectively, but the Bank
demurred pending review of a November 1983 full supervision report. This report
revealed that only 47% of the loan had been disbursed (vs. the Appraisal
Report's projected 90% profile), and noted (i) that only the BDB component was
fully disbursed (as of Oecember 1983) and (ii) that BIDC had disbursed merely
35% of its industrial estates subcomponent and 25% of its industrial promotion
and technical assistance subcomponents. Major problems outlined at this
juncture of loan implementation were:
(a) BIOC had committed loan proceeds slower than expected due to the
initial year-long start-up delay, difficulties in using Bank
procurement procedures, reduced funding from GOB and the recessionary
environment;
(b) EPC had been reluctant to advance monies against its US$0.3 million
Loan allocation for its Export Grant Incentive Scheme due to lack of
working capital resources;
(c) NTB had decided to use other funding sources (which incurred no cost
to the government) to finance the agreed-upon Bank program and had
failed to come up with a suitable alternative despite considerable
effort from several bank missions, and
(d)  Loan proceeds were not directly disbursed to participating agencies:
they nominally received loan monies through annual budget allocations
from the GOB. Thus, there was no incentive for implementing agencies
to provide the documentation required for disbursement to the Bank on
a timely basis, further impeding loan disbursement. In the case of
projecttiolders with subsidiary GUB loan agreements, this situation
worked to their advantage since, by delaying the paperwork, they could
thus delay interest payments.
2.10      The November 1983 Bank supervision mission recommended (i) a one-year
extension of the then-present March 31, 1984 closing date; (ii) consideration of
a proposal to drop NTB from the Vocational and Management Training Component and
reallocating its informal allocation to BI.IAP and BOB, and (iii) that EPC be
authorized to request reimbursement directly from the World Bank. On February
X, 1984 the Bank formally agreed to extend the Loan Closing Date to March 31,
1985 and shortly thereafter EPC secured an additional budgetary allotment of
US475,U0O from the GOB after its request for direct reimbursement privileges
from the World Bank was denied.
2.11      Commitments and disbursements for Loan components implemented by EPC
and BIMAP accelerated thereafter: EPC expanded its criteria for reimbursement
under the Export Grant Incentive Scheme, organized several trade missions and
arranged additional sector studies and specialized consultancy services for
local manufacturers, while HIMAP used its additional allocation from the
now-defunct NTB component to finance the costs of four more training manuals and
hardware and software requirements for eleven microcomputers, both of which were
used in conjunction with office technology training courses.  BIDC, however,
found that its proposed construction schedule was increasingly less viable in
view of the protracted business recession. On March 20, 1985, with 84% of Loan



-8-
1813-BAR committed and 76% of it disbursed, the GOB requested a six-month
extension of the Loan Closing Date. This second extension, from March 31, 1985
to September 30, 1985, was approved by the Bank six days later. A subsequent
supervision mission (June 1985), which assessed prospects for full Loan
disbursement, concluded that (i) BIDC would not be able to complete its full
construction program due to reduced demand and higher vacancies related to
generalized business sector malaise11/ and (ii) that BDMAP would only utilize
US$O.350 million of the USS0.500 million nominally allocated to the Vocational
and Management Training Loan Component. All other components were expected to
be disbursed within the revised project completion timeframe. On October 1,
1985 the GUB indicated its willngness to cancel undisbursed loan proceeds, and
on April 16, 1986, the Bank cancelled the undisbursed balance of Loan 1413-BAR
equivalent to US$1,151,241: final disbursement figures among Loan 1813-BAR
components are detailed below.

A. ISIDC
3.01      General   Since its creation in 1965 the BIDC has established itself
as the key Barbadian institution responsible for stimulating, facilitating and
undertaklng industrial development. In pursuit of this mandate it administers
fiscal incentives provided under the Industrial Development and the Fiscal
11/ In mid-April 1985, 21% of a total of 1,113,000 million sq. ft. of factory
space owned by BLDC was not rented and 28% of the 222,516 sq. ft. of
factory space financed with World Bank resources was unoccupied.

Incentives Act(s), constructs and maintains industrial estates and factory
buildings, stimulates foreign investment promotion through its New York and
Brussels offshore offices and undertakes the planning and coordination of
national industrial policy. At the time of Loan 1813-BAR appraisal BIDC had
established and was maintaining nine industrial estates located in the island's
most populous parishes wherein a total of 109 new industries had been
established.12/ In 1981 the Corporation acquired two sites -- Speightstown and
Spring Garden -- for additional industrial estates. BIDC's current industrial
park holdings (which vary in size from 6 acres to 22 acres) total 1,659,616 sq.
ft. of factory space (composed of basic shells, industrial workshops and
special-purpose facilities) constructed on 165.31 acres.
3.02      Delays affecting BIUC's construction activities (para. 2.07) threw the
project timetable off by nearly two years: by the end of FY 1982/83 41,235 sq.
ft. of factory space had been completed as opposed to appraisal projections of
49U,000 sq. ft., although the following year BIDC completed an additional
127,000 sq. ft. and finished 96X of total land development activities initiated
under the project (see Annex 5). Implementation problems related to the BIDC
loan component began to surface soon after construction activities began:
(a)  by mid-1981 tIDC had demonstrated reluctance to enforce the new rental
policy (reflecting a fundamental variance with the Bank's belief that
financial viability was a medium-term institutional objective), and
(b)  sharp increases (4UX)13/ in construction costs in the first year of
project implementation resulted in:
(i)  higher rental rates that exceeded regional rates by a factor of
two and, as the implementation period extended further into the
local recession, created greater resistance by tenants to rent
Bank-financed facilities or to promptly pay rental obligations;
(ii) project co-financing constraints due to GOB austerity program
limitations;
(iii) a reduced number of factory shells actually constructed under
the Project, and
(iv) BIDC's worsening financial position due to higher expenses and
static revenues.
3.03       Relations with the Bank grew somewhat strained as the local recession
deepened and the existing clients began to cut back on rented space, to fall
behind in payments, or (in some instances) to close operations (due to business
failures). Arrears (as a percentage of collectable rents) steadily grew from 25%
in FY 1981/82 to 44% in FY 1983/84 to 47% in 1984/85. Actual rental revenues
began to sharply lag behind appraisal projections in 1983 (i.e.BDS$3.39

production to Third Country markets.

million vs. ADS$6.37), while expenses continued to increase in proportion to
BIDC's expanded physical assets: in 1984 BIDC registered a loss of BDS$3.22
million (Annex 6), substantially at variance with the Appraisal Report's
BUSSO.270 million surplus. The bank found it difficult to agree with BIDC's
perception that bank-mandated rent increases were creating hardship for local
enterprises and contributing to arrears, default and attrition, in view of the
fact that rental costs as a percentage of total costs of firms operating in
Barbados averaged a marginal 2.8Z (BIDC research). This impasse -ws pre-empted,
in September 1985, by the GOB decision to grant a 20X rent subsidy to all BIDC
industrial estate clients. The fact that this subsidy was awarded
indiscriminately (as opposed to solely to those companies experiencing financial
difficulties and/or substantial rental arrears), had marginal impact on total
costs (see above), and was implemented just prior to the 1985 general election,
strongly suggests that this decision was prompted by political concerns. As a
consequence, by the closing date of Loan 1813-BAR iIDC reverted to the rental
pricing schedule that had prevailed prior to the Loan.
3.04      CDB  In December 1983 Cob and GOB signed a US$2.500 million loan
agreement providing co-financing support for 267,589 sq. ft. of the 530,000 sq.
ft. of factory shells designated for development under Loan 1813-BAR.14/ CDB
had financed 400,379 sq. ft. of new BIDC factory shells and the rehebilitation
of 2,000 sq. ft. of factory floor space through two previous loans to BIDC.
When BIDC extended the building construction program and reduced the scope of
works to meet immediate and critical needs in 1985, CDB's share of factory shell
co-financing was reduced to 181,277 sq. ft. (at four industrial estates) and
land development co-financing was cut from 1.841 million sq. ft to 1.001 million
sq. ft. (at five industrial parks). On October 25, 1985 CDB officially
cancelled the remaining undisbursed loan proceeds, which totaled US$1.380
million.
3.05      Technical Assistance and Investment Promotion  BIDC financed three
technical assistance studies/projects (carried out by different consulting
agencies) with Loan 1813-BAR monies, exceeding its US$.400 million allocation by
US$.047 million. The first consbltancy, a study outlining a national industrial
sector strategy, provided the basis for the GOB's eventual 1983-87 Industrial
Development Plan,L5/ which in turn was followed (in 1985) by direct
presentations to five potential foreign investors. BIDC also arranged for an
organizational and financial management study which, not falling within the
scope of technical assistance activities defined within the Loan Agreement,
necessitated an amendment (whicn was approved by the Bank in December 1981).
The findings of this study have been selectively and partially implemented. The
third consultancy provided direct diagnostic assistance to eight manufacturing
14/  of this amount, CDB was to assist in the construction of 195,357 sq. ft.
throughout March 1983-March 1985: the remainiag 72,232 sq. ft. of
construction were accounted for by three factory shells completed prior to
CDB's involvement in tne project.
15/ This plan affirmed Barbados's private-sector/export led development plan
and proposed a strategic shift from 'labor'-intensive to 'skill'-intensive
industries as well as targeted support to four industrial subsectors --
electronics, information services, medical supplies and apparel.

firms, followed by asisistance during the subsequent implementation phase and a
wrap-up seminar.  Ac. rding to BIDC statiatics, 55 major recommendations were
proposed for the ei,bc participating companies, 6b% of which were fully
implemented: all companies reported improved operations and financial
performance.lb/  BI)C utilized US$0.629 million of the US$.600 million
allocated to investment promotion to cover the costs of maintaining its New York
representative office and advertising.
3.06      Impact Assessment  Due to adverse economic circumstances the scope of
the BLDC overall project was reduced from BDS$20 million to BDS$15 million
(para. 3.08), following BIDC's second project extension request in March 1985.
The original project envisaged construction of 520,000 sq. ft. of factory space
on some 30 acres of improved land, based on a BDS$33.75 per sq. ft construction
cost in mid-1979 and price escalation factor of 15% for 1980 and 12%
thereafter. In fact, the average construction costs (usirg competitive bid
procedures) were BDS$55.00 per sq. ft. in 1980 (due in part to wage increases):
further cost increases were limited to 18% for the years 1981-85 (to BUS$65.00
per sq. ft.). Thus, two factors limited implementation of the original program:
actual construction costs were some 40% higher than originally anticipated and
market demand for space fell mid-way through the program. The result was that
new factory space totalling 222,512 sq. ft. was created (22 of the projected 35
buildings) and some 24 acres of land (out of a projected 30 acres) were
developed. Construction cost overruns were moderate (within 10% of estimated
costs), and completion delays -- when significant -- were due almost exclusively
to inclement weather. At present, approximately 50% of the factory space
financed by Loan 1813-BAR is unoccupied and tnerefore not earning income. Rents
are currently renegotiated at three-year intervals and are structured around the
World Bank Loan 1813-BAR terms: the 20% rent subsidy will be effective for the
period January 198b to December 1987.
3.07      Among the benefits accruing as a consequence of the project, BIDC
stressed an overall improvement in construction quality (materials, design ard
techniques), greatly enhanced project management skills and the cost effective
use of SSE subcontracting which has been widely adopted by similar agencies in
the region engaged in factory shell construction. On the other hand, BIDC felt
that the Bank unduly stressed financial viability (i.e. the Bank's intransigence
regarding a downward revision of the rental rate structure), which they
perceived to be secondary to the principal Loan objectives: increasing
industrial output, industrial exports and employment. BIDC is of the opinion
that the Bank may have modified its stance had it considered the limited
potential of the domestic market and Barbados' manufacturing capabilities (i.e.
problems BIDC faces in stimulating local industry), stiff regional competition
for enclave and local investment in industrial estate projects, and the gravity
of the manufacturing sector's distress (i.e. heightened sensitivity to cost
changes) by 1985, after four consecutive years of global and local recessionary
conditions (Annex 2).
1/  There appears to be scope for a similar, follow-on project targeted on
technology (technology choice, production engineering, factory layout,
etc.).

3.09      General   BOB has been 3roviding medium- and long-term financing for
private enterprises in the industry, small manufacturing, tourism, and fishing
subsectors since its creation in 1969 as an autonomous, Government-owned
institution. At the time of Loan 1813-BAR appraisal, BDB was still very small,
having achieved only moderate growth due to high staff turnover and limited
interaction with the manufacturing subsector. It was marginally profitable, its
lending was concentrated in the tourism sector (65X), it lacked a financial and
lending policy which reflected strategic and financial goals, and its portfolio
was of somewhat poor quality and subject to arrears. Provisions in the Bank
Loan (para.2.05) addressed these issues and, in conjunction with the Loan's
technical assistance subcomponent, laid the foundations for a financially
stronger, administratively more capable institution to carry out the ambitious
lending program BDB had scheduled involving net loan portfolio growth from
USS9.45 million to U1S36.79 million between 1979 and 1984. The BDB Board voted
in November 1980 to (i) hire qualified operations staff; (ii) raise salary
levels to parity with that of the Central bank and Barbados National Bank; (iii)
accept the Loan 1113-BAR staff training program developed by management, and
(iv) adopt a plan for portfolio recuperation, thus substantially complying with
Loan Agreement commitments.
3.10      In Uecember 1980 the World Bank approved the first five subprojects
(one exceeding the US$150,000 free limit) which together summed to 20X of BDB's
Loan 1513-BAR onlending component.  By March 1981 1DB had increased its lending
rate to 12Z (on the basis of the just-completed Central Bank study of interest
rates), the Central Bank had approved a USSl million equity contribution as per
previous agreement with the Bank, and financing for the first of two subsectoral
studies (electronics) had been initiated. At this stage of loan implementation
the following problems had surfaced: (i) in 1981 BDB had accepted the foreign
exchange risk on a USS7.75 million IDB loan; (il) BDB financial results showed
strong growth but poorer repayment performance and profitability (in the first
instance exacerbated by the somewhat higher salary structure and increased staff
levels recommended by the Appraisal Report); and (iii) progress on aggressive
portfolio recuperation was stymie. by political and social pressures. Despite
these difficulties, BDB continued to consolidate the reorientation of its
lending operations towards the small manufacturing/industrial sectors and
speedily committed Loan 1813-BAM monies:  by November 1981, BDB had committed
US02.O million of its USS3.0 million lending component and disbursed US$0.814
million; raising the possibility of a follow-on Bank loan.



- 13 -
3.11      BDB's portfolio continued to grow vigorously in 198217/ and profits
briefly spurted (reaching a 3.57X return on equity in 1982) due to successive
interest rate increases that matched market interest rate adjustments, but by
1983 the impact of regional trade problems and reduced tourist treffic nad begun
to affect loan collection levels and BOB's profitability. In addition, GOB
austerity measures precluded acceptance of BDB's revised salary structure or its
assumption of MDB's foreign exchange risk. Nonetheless, BDB disbursed its final
subloan under Loan 1813-BAR in December of 1983 and received Bank approval for
financing a management information system with the remainder of its technical
assistance subcomponent (USS.171 million), which was fully operational by
mid-1984. BDB's final disbursements under Loan 1813-BAR were USS3.000 million
for subloans and USS.139 million for technical assistance.18/
3.12      Financial Performance  (Annexes 7, 8, 9)  BDB's loan portfolio grew
from BDSS23.6 million to BDSS71.4 million between 1980 and 1984 and its
composition shifted towards the manufacturing sector: the relative shares of
tourism and manufacturing/industry were BDS$16.1 million and BDS35.75 million in
M98O and in 1984 these relative shares were BDS$28.8 million and BDSS36.7
million. D Net profits rose from BDS$0.076 million in 198& to BDS$0.455
million in 1982, but BDO's performance in terms of invested capital and total
assets was not promisiug: return on equity rose between 1980 and 1982 from less
than 11 to 3.57X, but in relation to total assets the return continued low (.18Z
to .74Z) due to the rapid growth of BDB's total assets (see Annex 15).
Thereafter BOB's profitability began to decline, principally due to a narrower
operating spread (which fell from 4.81 in 1982 to 3.89 in 1983, the first of
successive years of declining spreads). BDB's problems were exacerbated by its
increasing inability to collect accounts due: in 1981 67X of principal and
interest falling due were collected, while in 1983 this dropped to 57% and in
1985 to 43X. In 1984 BDB initiated tentative steps towards writing off its bad
debt portfolio, which culminated in 1986 with a BDSS8.082 million charge against
income. By end-February 1987 BDB's doubtful loans in its tourism and industry
portfolios totalled BDS$32.4 million, while provisions amounted to BDSS18.7
million and equity summed to only BD0$10.1 million. A BDS$12 million
Interamerican Development Bank (IDS) loan for industrial lending, signed in
Harch 19t6, was transferred from the GOB to BDB as equity, which has enabled BDB
to begin recognizing substantial loan1 losses.  A technical assistance component
attached to the IDB loan provides fo d i) a financial analyst to assist in the x
recovery of BOIl's loan portfolio; (i- an industrial engineer to assist in the
technical assessment of projects, and (iii) a specialist in cost accounting to
assist in setting up standardized accounting systems for small hotels. In the
future BDB will continue restructuring its loan portfolio and extend assistance
to ailing projects through the use of outside consultants and advisors.
7, Commitments grew 27X p.a. and disbursements grew 1OO1 p.a. during the
1979-82 period, and the manufacturing sector supplanted tourism as the
lead sector.
8/  US*.100 financed acquisition of a computerized management information
system and the rest financed the costs of two studies done on the plastics
and electronics/small machine shop industrial subsectors.
19, The GOB's 1983 decision to Impose credit ceilings on the tourism sector
effectively restrained its growth within BDB's portfolio.

3.13      Impact Assessment  The Bank sought to accomplish specific
institutional objectives with BOB through project implementation: (i) improve
BOb's financial viability by introducing a fee structure and marLcet-competitive
interest rates; (ii) bolster the scope and criteria of subproject appraisal and
supervision activities; (iii) implement a decisive action plan for portfolio
recuperation (exercising guarantees and writing off aged delinquent accounts);
(iv) protect BDB's long-term financial viability by taking appropriate measures
to offset its existing foreign exchange risks; (v) upgrading BDB's salary
structure so as to attract and retain qualified staff; (vi) hiring new staff,
and (vii) establish institutional objectives and revised policies and procedures
to protect and sustain BDB's operations. Marginal progress was achieved in
these areas: BDB's profits briefly rose on increased revenues and its revised
lending rates appear to have a permanent character, but the industrial recession
and BOB's inability to constructively deal with existing portfolio arrears have
exacted costs that are only now being recognized. Barbados' macroeconomic
difficulties limited BDi's ability to hedge its foreign excharge risk (currently
BOB's foreign exchange ex-posure is US$15.1 million against which provisions
total- US$0.050 million).2U/ Recent developments (para 3.12) indicate that
serious loan appraisal and supervision deficiencies in the past have contributed
to BDB's current operating difficulties. Technical assistance financing under
Loan 1813-lAR which was largely used or acquiring a computerized Management
Information System, has greatly enhanced BOB's control procedures but not added
to the institution's ability to appraise and manage its portfolio. Secondarily,
the sectoral composition ard quality of BDB's loan portfolio suggest that the
institution has still not adopted an effective risk-diversified lending
strategy.
3.14      Subprojects  (Annex 10)  World bank loan proceeds on-lent by BDl
provided expansion and start-up financing for 21 Barbadian enterprises (ore firm
received two loans). The majority of the subloans went to smaller companies:
b3X of the subborrowers accessed merely 12% of the total lending component. A
substantial number of these smaller loans (under US$50,000) financed the
purchase of vehicles for the transport and the construction sectors and printing
equipment. The two largest loans (accounting for 4bX of BDB's total loan
allocation) supported expansion activities of food processing firms, while the
next-largest loans went to enterprises in the construction sector. Between
them, these two industrial subsectors utilized US$2.526 million of the US$3.000
million industrial lending component. Geographically, most of the loans went to
firms located in and around Bridgetown (55% by number and 56% by amount); five
of the subloan recipients are located in BIOC industrial estates.
3.15      The larger loans in the BDB's Bank portfolio were extended to
financially viable, well-managed companies, thus creating high prospects of
ulttaate loan recovery, provided supervision and collection efforts by the BDB
are upgraded and maintained. A review of a sample of Loan 1813-BAR subborrowers
2L/ 1986 audited financial statements indicated that BDB's debt-equity ratio
exceeds 5:1 and that the Manager of Operations staff position is vacant:
both of these developments contravene Loan Agreement convenants.



- 15 -
indicated that many loan decigions were based on optimistic forecasts reflecting
the 1979-81 business boom, which resulted in substantial excess capacity in the
construction and transport subsectors. BDB post-loan statistics show
exceedingly high arrearage (28Z) among Loan 1813-BAR clients. For smaller
loans, 45Z of total number of subborrowers (l1Z of the Bank portfolio) have gone
bankrupt, mostly in transport and construction subsectors. BDB attributes this
poor loan servicing performance to the recessionary business environment
prevailing from 1983-85 (which created tremendous difficulties for companies
just as they began to implement operations), poor financial and administrative
management by the enterprises, and project implementation delays.21   It is also
clear that actual employment created through Bank sub-loans was substantially
less than tne 1,500 jobs projected at appraisal, due to contractior. and
progressive restructuring within the manufacturing sector, overly optimistic
appraisal projections, and financing of more expanston than new investment
projects.
C.       EPC
3.16     General.  EPC was officially established in July 1979 upon passage of
the Export Promotion Corporation Act, which provided for its statutory autonomy
from the Ministry of Trade and Industry. The new institution has been
explicitly mandated to provide well-focused support to Barbados' manufactured
exports sector. EPC has supplemented its services by developing a comprehensive
information center, which provides specific market data for Barbadian
manufacturers, such as (i) tariff, licensing and import regulations; (ii) names
of manufacturers, importers, and distributors overseas; (iii) fashion trends
relating to colors and styles, and (iv) specific product industry journals. The
number of exporting manufacturers in Barbados covered by EPC has risen from 176
to 235 since 1980, and, in the interim, EPC has organized or provided
ubstantial assistance to some 23 trade missions overseas.
3.17     EPC was neither staffed nor functional at the time of Loan appraisal;
more than one-and-one-half years were spent subsequent to loan effectiveness in
recruiting staff and developing programs. Progress was retarded by the
institution's inability to find a qualified expatriate executive director, whose
initial three-year contract was to be financed by Loan 1813-BAR monies.22   Soon
after EPC's Board appointed a local businessman to thie position in June 1981,
the Bank received EPC's financing plan, which proposed to spend a part of loan
proceeds to support the newly initiated Export Grant and Iacentive Scheme
(EGIS), wherein exporters were reimbursed for up to 75Z of the direct expenses
incurred by market research, product design and testing, advertising and
promotion, preparation of sales literature, participation in fairs and
21/ A comprehensive 1985 portfolio review of BDB's total loan portfolio found
that 27Z of arrearages were caused by marginal enterprise/over-expansion of
facilities and 23? were due to a lack of managerial and technical
skill/absentee owner or operator.
22/ Approximately US$.100 million of the total US$.300 million allocation was
used for consultant services and for a review of the system of export
incentives available to Barbadian manufacturers.

exhibitions, and promotion missions to and from Barbados.23   The substitution
of financing the costs of hiring an expatriate executive director for financing
EGIS activities did not expedite loan disbursements: EPC'e use of loan proceeds
did not really begin until 1984 due to: (i) lack of working capital (para.
2.08), and (ii) EPC's inability to quickly gain the confidence and support of
the manufacturing sector. By December 1983, only US$0.063 million of the
US$0.300 million component had been committed. Thnde months later, the Ministry
of Finance agreed to supplement PEC's operatinv subvention by US$0.075 million,
which effectively reactivated the EGIS. EPC ultimately disbursed US$0.241
million of its US$0.300 million loan component.
3.18     Impact Assessment.  EPC channelled approxirmately 53Z of its total
US$0.241 million 1813-BAR disbursements to EGIS activities, most of which were
used for outward missions (332), trade fairs and exhibitions (29S), and
advertising and promotion (23X). In addition, US$0.114 million (about 47Z) was
spent on short-term technical assistance projects. (principally to firms in the
garments and furniture subsectors). The EPC was a nascent institution at the
time of Loan appraisal: its delayed start-up was prolonged by the fact that its
staff had to acquire practical understanding and experience regarding export
markets, export requirements (i.e., product design and quality, production
management, import regulations, etc.), and exporting k:now-how (i.e.,
documentation and trade requirements, establishing an external market presence,
effective distribution arrangements, proper pricing and negotiating strategies,
etc.). No hard statistical data is available to quantify EPC's direct impact on
manufactured exports. However, much of EPC's specialized assistance to
individual exporters could not be fully effective, due to both the rigorous
performance standards required by extra-regional export markets and, to a lesser
extent, the institution's lack of experience. EPC notes that its efforts to
increase exports have been frustrated by the decline of the regional export
market, difficulties in penetrating Third Country Markets24 (i.e., due to the
limited range and quality of local export products, serious financial and
production management deficiencies in indigenous exporting companies, and high
local shipping costs), and the absence of indigenous design capability. During
its short existence, the institution has acquired invaluable experience, and, in
the future, will be able to provide more efficient and effective assistnace to
Bartadian exporters.
D.       NTB and PBIMAP
3.19     Vocational and Management Training (NTB and BIMAP).  BIMAP was
established in 1971 through the collaborative efforts of the private sector and
the GOB as a private, not-for-profit corporation offering instruction designed
to improve management skills in both the public and private sectors and to
increase national productivity. BIMAP offers a range cf covrses in business
231 Later EPC included financing for production of samples and demonstration
kits.
241 The increase in export figures shown in Annex 4 to "other, countries is due
to the assembly industry and the INTEL exports (an American electronic
company) to Puerto Rico, which is classified separately from the U.S.A.

administration and management at its small campus located next to the BOB 25/
and provides as well specialized technical assistance to small-scale enterprises
(financed through GOB grant resources and various donor agencies), consulting
and research-related services to larger enterprises and in-house training for
corporate clients. Operating revenues are derived from training and consulting
fees (comprising 7OZ of total revenues in 1985), grants and donations (20X of
total revenues), and membership subscriptions (approximately 195 companies
provided 6X of total revenues). In 1985 BII4AP completed its tenth consecutive
year of profitab' operations, recording a USS83,907 profit on revenues
totalling US$863,381.26/
3.20      BIMAP was originaldy allocated USS0.250 million under Loan 1813-BA to
finance the foreign exchange c osi  of developing and publishing training manuals
and related materials in the areA-s of general and financial management,
marketing, personnel and indua.Llal relations, management of human resources,
production management and taxation. Although BIMAP promptly presented its
financing proposal to the bsank (previous to departure of the first supervision
mission in October 1980), commitments did not begin until July 1982 due to
disruptions caused by ongoing construction activities (para. 2.09) and
constraints related to working capital (para. 2.08) and staff adequacy. By May
1984 six manuals had beep substantively completed and contracting arrangements
for four more manuals ha|d been initiated, requiring a US$0.018 million increase
in Bank financing which was informally agreed to by the Bank. NTB's inability
to define an alternative program for Bank financing under the Vocational and
Management Training component of Loan 1813-BAR freed up additional resources for
BIMAP activities:  BIMP requested two subsequent increases in its resource
allocation (to USS0.315 million in January 1985 and then US$0.350 million in
June 1985) to finance the purchase of a computer training system and 16 computer
terminals. BMP ultimately utilized USS0.309 million from Loan 1813-BAR, which
financed 88Z of the total costs of producing the manuals (accounting for 70Z of
BIMAP's Loan 1813-BAR allocation) and computer software and hardware (accounting
for 30% of BIHAP's Loan 1813-BAR allocation).
3.21      Impact Assessment Ten manuals were destgned, tested and published
under the Bank loan which today constitute the core teaching materials for
numerous BIMAP courses: more than 1,094 copies have been reproduced and
distributed to students since June 1983. Each manual has been designed in a
modular format, enabling both selective reproduction and continuous revision and
development of training materials. These teaching aids have had substantial
impact on both the effectiveness and continuous growth of BIMAP's training
activities (in 1985 53 courses were offered by BIMAP to 1,018 participants,
exceeding the previous year's performance of 33 courses offered to 756
participants and leading to a 37X increase in revenues arising from training
activities). In addition, BIMAP acquired personal computers, peripherals and a
high speed copier with Bank loan proceeds, all of which are being used as
envisaged. The computer terminals have enabled BIMAP to introduce modules in
computer applications within existing course outlines of various business
administration courses, which has been enthusiastically received by course
participants.
25/ Construction of this facility was partially financed by a World Bank loan
disbursed concurrently to Loan 1813-BAR.
26/ Kevenues included grants and donations totalling USS172,935.

E. Bank
3.22      General   The Bank paid scrupulous attention to procurement decisions
(i.e. factory estates) and bidding procedures (i.e. consultancy services),
striving to maintain cond&tions (i) fostering competition and selection based on
performance and merit; (ii) increasing the participation of small-scale firms;
(iii) ensuring the appropriateness of technical assistance (i.e. scope and
method of sectoral studies, relative cost/benefit of the range of factory shell
prototypes developed, selection of computer hardware and software, etc.), and
(iv) establishing and sustaining arms-length relationships (i.e. bids awarded to
BIDC's construction division were certified as cost competitive by outside
consulting engineers). BDB supervision and appraisal activities, targeted for
focused technical assistance at Loan appraisal, did not receive the level of
support the Bank anticipated and that its portfolio quality and past performance
required. Bank supervision missions continually stressed the importance of
acquiring this type of technical assistance, but, BDB used minimal amounLs of
Bank monies for these purposes.
3.23      While Bank major supervision missions were scheduled annually (except
for 18 months gap between 11/83 and 05/85), bottlenecks affecting project
execution (i.e. working capital constraints, BIDC's reduced budgetary
allocation, NTB's inability to devise an appropriate program for Bink financing,
etc.) and events leading to non-compliance with the Loan Agreement (i.e. BDB
foreign exchange risK, BIDC rent subsidy etc.) were promptly identified by Bank
personnel and explored in continuous dialogue with the GOB. Still, the 18-month
hiatus between supervision missions (1983-85) may have fostered an
overly-optimistic assessment of BIDC's ability to recover construction costs,
considering the duration and depths of the domestic recession.
IV. Conclusions and Recommendations
4.U1      General   The objectives -- both explicit and implicit -- defined at
the outset of project implementation have been largely achieved as envisioned:
the nation's stock of developed industrial estates and new/expanded enterprises
has increased, export promotion and information/support facilities have been
provided to industrial enterprises, industrial productivity and viability has
been enhanced by the provision of teaphing materials and computer hardware, and
the institutional capabilities of all implementing agencies have been
strengthened. The country's deteriorating economic performance prevented
project outputs from achieving appraisal projections: merely 340 net new
jobs were created in the manufacturing sector from 1978-81 vs. 5000 new jobs
forecast at appraisal, 27 and manufactured output (as measured by GDP) and
exports of manufactured goods grew at an inflation-adjusted rate of 2.8% and 15%
per annum, respectively vs. 20% growth per annum projected at appraisal. As
well, a subsidiary project objective -- adjusting BIDC rental policies to
reflect real costs, thus permitting full cost recovery and ultimately financial
and economic viability - has not been accomplished due to the GOB's decision to
grant a 20% discount on BLDC rental rates in late 1985.
27/ Approximately 5000 of the 5340 new jobs created 1978-81 were the
consequence of job turnover as structural changes occurred within the
manufacturing sector in response to increased wage rates and skill levels.



- 19 -
4.02      The relationship between the Bank and BIDC soured during the course of
project implementation, exacerbated by differences regarding project objectives,
BLDC's role and the relative importance of factory rents in total manufacturing
costs. More frequent supervision missions (para. 3.22) might have ameliorated
this situation.
4.03      Crucial elements affecting the outcome of BIDC's project component
were:
(i) that at the outset (and throughout project Implementation) BIDC
did not share the GOB's and the Bank's view that financial
viability and recovery of economic costs were to be achieved in
the medium-term;
(ii) that a basic difference existed between the GOB's desire to
stimulate private sector involvement in the provision of factory
space (through increased rental rates) and BIDC's institutional
interest to perpetuate its subsidized construction division
(accounting for approximately 55X of BIDC's total staf: at Loan
Appraisal);
(iii)  that a basic inconsistency existed between the GOB's   sire to
maintain exchange rate stability and its planning objective of
attracting foreign investors (i.e., labor costs in terms of US
dollar were not competitive regionally); and
(iv) that the Bank's appraisal projections were too optimistic in
assuming: (a) BIDC's positive cash flow by 1983-84 based on full
occupancy rates and minimal arrears; (b) a rather short payback
period and correspondingly high rental rates; and (c) a lower
than actual rate of increase in local construction costs.
Moreover, BIDC was hard put to reconcile two Loan objectives -- to establish
prices that ensure full construction cost recovery and to attract foreign
investors in competition with similar facilities in the Caribbean region. In
view of the overvaluation of BDS dollar, this reconciliation has not been
achieved.
4.04      Initially, Bank efforts to improve the financial performance of
project participants were frustrated by two factors: (i) BIDC was not able to
begin to collect increased rental revenue until Bank-financed factory space
began to be completed (end-1982) and (ii) BDB's increased lending rates were
only gradually extended to its full portfolio and augmented staff levels at
higher salaries led to higher operating expenses. The Bank's efforts to
strengthen BDB have met with mixed results: while a computer system acquired
with bank technical assistance funds has had a positive impact on portfolio
management and financial control, BIDB's supervision and appraisal capabilities
did not receive the attention and resources that its worsening performance
record called for. bank missions always discussed supervision and collection
efforts and pushed for the necessity of technical assistance in these areas, but
there was no will within BI)B to carry out its espoused technical assistance
plans, partly because BOB believed its portfolio problems were of a more
political nature. As well, BDB was not able to secure (i) GOB approval for a
revised salary schedule; (ii) GOB's assumption of foreign exchange risk on
external loans or adequate exchange loss provisions to offset related losses



- 20 -
(which should have been a precondition of loan approvals), and (iii) effective
Implementation of its action plan to reduce arrears and cleanse its portfolio.
4,05      Although the technical assistance component of the project relied on
the effective performance of institutions that were largely unformed and
untested at the outset, the risk proved to be worth taking. Indeed, ex post
discussions with businesses and exporters assisted through the projectTs export
promotion and management training components indicate that these activities
were, overall, helpful for companies and institutions alike. Thus, despite the
lm'pact that significant trade problems, a prolonged domestic recession and
related austerity measures had on project activities, Loan 1813-BAR has
achieved, at least in part, its original project objectives.
4.06      Lessons Learned
(a) Infrastructure and factory shells should be dimensioned on the basis
of conservative estimates of demand and expanded only as demand at
full price materializes. While maintaining cost recovery as a
long-term objective, (during the life of the factory shells
constructed and within the amortization period of the loan) full cost
recovery for industrial parks in the short run may not be feasible:
i) When due to macro-economic or market conditions firms experience
financial difficulties, temporary rent relief should be
considered, particularly if the alternative is underutilization
of existing capacity.
ii) When the site itself is temporarily uncompetitive vis-a-vis other
locations, the objective should be to fill the vacant factory
space at the price where demand meets supply in the market
place, as long as rents exceed variable costs.
In summary, pricing of existing capacity should be flexible and adapt
to market conditions (para 3.06-07). If the temporary conditions last
for an extended period of time, the future use and/or disposition of
the factory shells should be reexamined. Capacity should be increased
in relatively modest increments as demand is manifested.
(b) The product design, production and marketing challenges faced by
manufacturing companies shifting from domestic/regional markets to
third country markets call for specialized, highly technical skills
and assistance (para 3.18). In similar projects the bank should
ensure that exporters and Government agencies huve access to adequate
consultant information, and that exporters are receiving the
specialized and professional assistance that would help them in
reaching their goals.

Dear Mr. Nowicki,
Ref: Project Completion Report on Barbados -
Industrial Development and Export Pro-
motion Project (Loan 1813)-BAR)
Further to your letter of November 17th, 1987 concerning e-he
above, we have the following comments on Section III C of the
above report.
1.    The BEPC has sought from its inception to recruit and
train its technical staff to provide a range of appro-
priate services to exporters. The use of consultants is
merely in support of and to supplement the range and
depth of technical skills existing within the Corpora-
tion. Therefore the third sentence of 3.16: 'Thus,
instead of providing a full range of export promotion
services and market surveys, EPC's principal activity is
arranging and employing foreign consultants ....', is
quite misleading.
2.    Paragraph 3.17's reference to 'the institution's
inability to find a qualified expatriate executive
director' is also inaccurate, since despite the original
provisions of the loan, the EPC Board from its inception
sought to recruit a Barbadian national as the Corpora-
tion's executive director.
3.    The statement in paragraph 3.18:  'It took several years
for EPC to establish a visible profile within the
Barbadian manufacturing community,' is too sweepinq and
could be misinterpreted. The manufacturers were.aware of

the EPC from day one because we were the authorised Government
body to issue certificates of origin to exporters and by 1981
were providing some export services to manufacturers.
Similarly, references to the lack of fully effectiveness of the
Corporation's programmes and "the institution's lack of
experience' fail to recognise the use by the EPC of foreign
consultants where necessary to augment its lack of experience.
Also, the main problem here, which regrettably persists, is the
almost non-existence of export marketing skills amongst the
management of the local manufacturing community and the very
limited product range immediately available to penetrate
extra-regional export markets.
Please let me know if you require any further information.
Yours sincerely
