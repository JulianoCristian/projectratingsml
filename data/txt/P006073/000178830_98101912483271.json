         of: (a) an investment promotion program and the construction\n            of industrial estates through the BIDC; (b) industrial\n            lending for fixed assets and permanent working capital\n            through the BDB; (c) promotion of manufactured exports,\n            training and marketing assistance to domestic exporters\n            through the EPC; (d) management and vocational training for\n            industry through BIMAP and the NTB. The project will not be\n            subject to any extraordinary risk. BIDC's proposed\n            policy for increased rental rates of factory space, to\n            enable it to generate a positive rate of return, may reduce\n            the demand for space in Barbados. This reduction, however,\n            is not expected to be large as the rentals will still be in\n            line with those charged by BIDC's competitors in the Caribbean."}, "docdt": "1980-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
