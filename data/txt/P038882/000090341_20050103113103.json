The lessons learned indicate that the\n            decentralization of urban rail systems from the Federal to\n            the State or a lower level of government is desirable\n            because it brings the operator closer to the users, thus\n            allows for the service to be more responsive to user needs\n            and wishes. All over Latin America and in many other parts\n            of the world, informal transport is provided with small and\n            often old and very polluting vehicles, that bring congestion\n            and air pollution to intolerable levels. Fare integration,\n            with the full inclusion of the rail system into the tariff\n            clearing house mechanism, requires a complete reformulation\n            of the current compensation criteria and procedures, which\n            will only be possible once the Federal Government subsidies\n            are clearly defined. This project confirmed that private\n            firms responsible for the delivery of rehabilitated rail\n            cars in Brazil have great difficulties in keeping to the\n            schedules agreed in their contracts. The construction works\n            for the stations on the South Line was split into three lots\n            and they were all bid at the same time. This implied that\n            payments also had to be carried out at the same time. The\n            experience of resettling small, informal businesses was\n            fairly unique in Brazil and in fact in the Bank. Its success\n            was due to the detailed information collected by Brazilian\n            Urban Railway Company (CBTU) and its consultant and the good\n            relationship built with the affected business people."}, "docdt": "2004-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
