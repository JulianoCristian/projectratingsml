Corporation's\n            (IOC) pipeline and refinery operations. In particular, the\n            project will provide financial support for: (i) a 1,450 km\n            products pipeline from the port of Khandla to Bhatinda; (ii)\n            a single buoy mooring (SBM) system at Salaya; (iii)\n            facilities to reduce the lead content of gasoline in two IOC\n            refineries; (iv) distributed digital control systems (DDCS)\n            in IOC's refineries; (v) two 15 MW gas turbine power\n            generators for the Digboi refinery; (vi) equipment and\n            services required to improve product yield and energy\n            conservation in refineries; (vii) expansion of the\n            lubricating oil complex and provision of a sulphur plant at\n            the Haldia refinery; and (viii) consulting services for\n            pipeline inspection, energy conservation, and yield\n            optimization studies and training."}, "docdt": "1989-04-06T00:00:00Z"}
