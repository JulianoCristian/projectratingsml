EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Government Of Yemen via the Ministry of Water and Environment- National Water
and Sanitation Authority signed a Consultaney Service Contract with Domier
Consulting to conduct the necesury ast.ignrnents of the Urban Wfll.er Supply and
Sanitation Project Contract No. NWSACS-3;

The assignment Is divided Into two main components: the preparation of Sectoral
Environmental Assessment for the water and sanitation sector In addition to the
Specific Environmental Impact Assessment studies for the fourteen urban centers all
over the Country. Preparation of the specific environmental assessment entaUs the
preparation of the Draft Environmental Impact Assessment Reports and the
Management Plan. followed by the revision of the Client before subnittlng the Final EIA
and EMP Reports. as the last component of the assignment.
Based on the contrad agreement of conducting the specHlc environmental Impac
assesament studies of.a total of fourteen urban centers. The assessment was a
condition of the donors for Implementing the development plans under the water al'ld
sanitation sector. Each of the urban centers was studied thoroughly through other
contracts; A feasibility studies and preliminary design were prepared for propoted
water ~opment and supply systems. In addlUon to studying the sanitation systems
and wastewater treatment plant and reuse facilities.

The proposed development projects at Dhamar urban center was classified ии
Category "A" under the Wor1d Bank project category list, whiCh requires a lull EIA
study. The study was commenced with the fteld fnvestfgatJons and conectlng' the.
necessary environmental and socioeconomic data. ThiS was followed by conducting a
comprehensive public consultation sessions at the targeted center. The results of thtf
consultations were considered in the analysiS.

The Consultant defined the valued environmental components in Ofder to analyze and
evaluate the anticipated negative impacts for the new water and sanitation projects and
the ~ Improper measures at the center under impl~mentaUon, After conducting
the analysis of the anticipated negative and positive impacts, it was possible to define
the necessary mitigation and protection measures that need to be taken during the
construction and operation phases. These measures were translated into ~n
environmental management and monitoring plans with all required implementation
meChanisms.

The Consultant adopted the Wodd Bank Operational Guidelines 4.01 for the year 1994
and the related safe guards' poOoIea to conduct the required EIA components. TI1e
current Yemeni laws and bI laws that are llIIated directly and indlrect1y to the
environmental impacts of the project were reviewed and considered.

This EIA Report entails ten Chapters. four of them are related to the environmental
asseslment and mitigations at 1he project sites and the Environmental Management
Plan. wI'tefe the others diSCUHed the legal aspects, community consultations, base line
conditions and the results and I'8CDrnmendations. The proposed water development,
water supply. sanitation and wastewater treatment projects will definitely create a
number of negative Impacts during the conatrudion phase and tninimum impads_
~~The generated Irnpads differ from one caSe to another, but
n,oaCof tfieM im~s ararnanageabfe and mltlgable. The main impacts were the land
and property acquisition near the proposed expansion project of the 'WWTP in addition

Draft E!A ~eport of Dhamar City                                                     2

    to the Interference with the traffic and the current services to the residents. The
    uncontroHed usage of treated wastewater by the fanners is another challenge that was
    defined and the ~ssary mitigations were proposed. Details of an the anticipated
    negative Impacts and the requested mitigation measures were provided in the Report.

    The proposed development projects will improve the standard of living of the local
    communities within the project area and deliver the necessary water and sanitation
    services to the citizens of Dhamar City. This project will improve wastewater treatment


-   and reuse aspects for the residents and, farmers through introducing a civilized
    infrastructure to the required standards in Yemen. These projects will relief some of the
    city districts from the dally suffering of discharging the sewage from their septic tanks
    and minimize the risks of pollution due to the flooding of the cesspits.

    The scoping session activity was fruitful and touches base with the main concerns of
    the communities and resident. The main concerns were the expectations of Jhe traffic
    congestions due to the narrow roads in the City and the suffering due to the
    introduction of the detours and secondary roads, I fear of land acquisitions, I expected
    delay in the construction, dust and noise poIIution...:xpected interruption in the pubHc

    It is essential that most of fhe mitigation measures IiVIIi be implemented at the impacted
    areas level in order to ensul9 the sustainability of the projects particularly during the
    construction and operation of the project with an effective participation of community
    and beneficiary groups. The Client should ensure that communities al9 involved in the
    progress of Implementing the project with proper usage of the new infrastructure

    It is also important to undertake monitoring program In terms of Implementing the
    proposed environmental plan so that the proposed mitigation measures are
    implemented. The monitoring should also foresee other environmental impacts that are
    probable to emerge and lay down strategies to overcome these impacts. The CHent,
    represented by the local corporation in Dhamar City, should create a specialized unit
    supervised by an Environmental Control Officer to follow up the implementation of the
    proposed mitigation measures and the management plan.

    Proper implementation of the EMP requires sound cooperation and coordination
    among all the stakeholders that will participate in the planning, Implementation and
    monitoring of all the proposed mitigation and preventive measures.

1.1.     Background

The Government of Yemen via the Ministry of Water and Environment signed a
consultancy setvtce contract with Domier Consulting GmbH on the 2!11' of September~
2005 to conduct the necessary assignments of tha Urban Water Supply and S8n1tatior1.
Project - Water Sectoral Environmental Assessment and Specific Environmental
Assessment, Contract No. NWSACS-3.

The rational behind the study was stemmed from the fact that water supply ~
sanitation sector of Yemen has currently employed remarkable efforts to meet great
challenges, particularly for the next 10 to 20 years. Major deep groundwater aquifers
are depleting causing often-serioUS groundwater quality deterioration. Addlllonafly, on~
Insufficient Information about distribution networks and house connections exists
                                                          "on

and maintenance of water supply faCilities as well as the economic operation and
management of water resources.

In connection with reduction of water avaiability, increase of the population and their
water demand, the Gowmment of Yemen dewloped an appropriate 6trateg/c water
polley and pubnshed several programs and projects to improve the water supply and
sanitation for several urban centers. Presentty the existing water sector planning will be
asseued under environmental aspeds by the means of the Sectoral Environmental
Assessment (SEA) which Is a userul tool for the poley to Incorporate important
environmental aspects into the manag.ement of groundwater resources, the wastawater
treatment and the water reuse.

Due to .the lack of information and approved feasibility studies and water re8OUn::fP*
reports of the fourteen urban centers durtng the progress of phase II of this study (end.    J


of 2006 and all the year 2007), it was more practical fonn the Client's point of view.~~
based on the Consultant request, to freeze the WOI1aJ unfit the feasibilities documents
of the huo Consultants of Groups I and If accomplished their works and their reporJs
became accepted and official by the Cnant. By the end of 2007, both the Consultants
CECI and Arcadia accomplished their works on the Water resources reports (Task A)
and the feasibility studies and preliminary dealgn reports (Task B).

The ClIent requested the consuttant to resume the works (Reference PMU lettfr
0112608 dated 22f9I2OO7) regarding the RtIUlIIPUon of the work. This wu foDowed trY
revising the wo""
                schedule and sot ups to meet the deadllnea of the project.

This Draft EIA Report entails the analysis of the exist environmental conditions at the
City of Dhamar and the anticipated impada after the construction of theJWater 8fld
sanHation projects as scheduled until the year 2025. The report entailed the propoaed
mitigation measures and environmental management and monitoring plans.

        Phase II: Project Specific Environmental As....mems (PSEA)

        Phase II consists of the following tasks which were partially accomplished:

        )-      Stage (1): Seeping and basing on the SEA report

        Preparation of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) for 14 selected uman
        centers in Yemen will be based upon the guidelines developed by the SEA in Phase I.
        A standardized tool will be available for Wortd Bank claSSification of water supply and
        sanitation projects In these centers.

        )-      Stage (2): Preparation of Environmental Assessments

        That will entail the following sub -tasks:

             .r Inventory of documents and information:
        Acquisition of data and information from studtes, maps, Interviews with agencies and
        specialists, about all relevant water supply and sanitation projects Issues and under
        consideration of special requirements of each project (e.g. nature and COI1tefVatiO(I.
        local economy, mining if any, health service, urban planning, infrastructure
        development) .

Each water supply and sanitation project has impacts on the environment and belongs
to the category A or B-dass of the World Bank Environmental Assessment
cfassification. so PSEA must be carried out In several screening and scoplng meetings
the essential Issues and InvettIgations (ct, lQ!.eractions between the _pmIIc! arKt
public/private adMtIes) must be dlKussed with all relevant authorities and agencies,
taking the criteria of the guidelines of the SEA-Report into account. In the meetings all
documents. information and Atmarks on the subject must be pnJsented by all relevant
authorities and related groups.

  -/'   Field investigations and data analyses:

It should be checked, whether Investigations on potentially ifT1lacted areas and
analyses of existing data set. might be supplemented by field measurements or
laboratory analyses, performed by the engineering consultant.

Main objective of the EIA Is the assessment of ecotogical and socio-eultural effects
Atsulted from proposed facilities and their operauons In the project area. These effects
could be caused by water extraction, construcllon of water supply facUlties; leaky
sewage network, raw or Insufficient treated sewage and inadequate operating waste
water treatment plants.

╗       Stage (3): Environmental Management Ptan
For each urban canter that entails water supply and sanitation project an
Environmentaf Management Plan (EMP) has to be developed. Based on the results of
the PSEA, the EMP pnJlents the poeitive expected effects and points out all the
measures required to mitigate potential negative effects of the project.

The EMP will contain Information, adMties, results and recommendations concaming

                        Yernen natural resources are the basis for the nation development. The/depletion or
                        degradation   rJ these resources leads to и loss rJ the country assets and undermined
                        the future development. Therefore, the GOY has established institutions and
                        responsibilities for environmental management, joined intemetional conventions and is
                        currently developing additional sector legislation and procedures. A National
                        Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) was adopted in 1995 and the environmental
                        Protection Law was enacted at the same year. The NEAP established priority issues
                        and actions In the main environmental field such as:
                               и   water resources;
                               и   land resources;
                               и   natural habitats; and
                               и   waste management.

                        During the late 90's and the beginning of 2000's, the Govemment developed major
                        strategies such as the Soootra Archipelago Master Plan and the Biodiversly,
                        Ecotourism, Women and Environment strategies. Parallel to this, the pubHc awarenns
                        and concerns have grown, supported by the increased 000 actiVi1y and the media
                        involvement in the environmental issues.

                   Regardless of these efforts, Yemen is facing seOOUI environmental problems: a severe
                   water crisis, large land. forests and unique habitats are being lost; waste pollutiOn Is
                   negatively affecting population health. poverty and development opportunities. It has
                   been clear that the country needs more investment in sustainable environmental
                   management. Conscious of this ne,!d. in October 2002, the Environmental Protection

                    Recently, the MinislJy of Water and Environment (MWE) proposed a National Water
                    Sectoral Strategy and Investmem Program (NWSSJP) for the period (2005-2009). The
                    Ministry of water and Environment is in charge of the most complex development
                    problems such   as:

                          и   management and planning of the wastewater treatment; and

                              the Water law.

                    The importance of water is not just for drinking and food production but it is considered
                   ?the basis for the nation development. Water availabiJly is an essential factor In pubfic

                  Jdevelopment. Therefore, the establishment of MWE (2003) came to reftect the genef'filf
    .' ,           !believe that it is necessary to in charge a single govemment agency comptetety
                   lresponsible for water development and management. to ensure that the development

    ~ -. ;          MWE is charged with achieving a rational and sustainable management of the
    :.:"'           environment in the various natural resources. In addition to that, the rote of MWE is to
                    support the implementation of the Water and Environmental Laws and raise the
                    awareness to protect water and other environmental resources from depletion and
                    pollution.

                    The expected investment (financing) from govemment budget is assumed to continue
                    at the level of 5O-S5 M USD annually for UWSS and 18-22 M usn annuaHy for ~.

The selection of criteria for the evaluatIOn of the environment and soQCHconomic of
the program requires an intenslve review for all potential environmental impacts of the
project Is necessary. Regardless, if it has direct or indirect affects with regards to the
general environmental categories (Wood Bank classiftcation category A, B. C, A), The
selection criteria and characterizatIOn will consider the following measures:

         и favorable or unfavorable impacts of the program from design. construction and
           operational;

         characteristics of the Yemeni environment;

The collected data and infonnalion are re\liewed and characterized in a scientific
manner, to achieve the best govemmental framework for the program objectives.


2.4.       Analysis and assessment of the alternatives for water and sanitation
           sector
The data should be investigated whether it has potentially affected areas and analyses
of existing data  sets might be supplemented by field measurements or laboratoty
analyses. These investigations coutd provide additional Informatlon for the
characterization of the project conditions or initial levels of water pollution with
quantitative information. The major Impacts of water supply and wastewater project
activities on natural and lOCio-eeonomlc conditions; project or facility
alternatives/modifications weAt evaluated.

Alternatives reviewed, compared and classified corresponding to their potential impact.
For each alternative measure total costs and benefits must be taken into account. Co'"
effectiveness and feasibility of the altematives are main aspects for the cfassification.
Assessment of alternatives will consider the fotlowing issues:

       и Review all the proposed alternative approaches from engineers to achieve the
         objectives of the program In cases of significant Impacts.
       и Consideration of altematives to the present and Intended water sector policy, If
         major et'I'ects must be feared for the environment.

2.5.       environmental Management Program
Environmental management has been given attention in Yemen. through various
actMties such as:

       и   The national environmental organization.
       и   The national fund and
       и   The environmentallegislatlon.

It became clear that despite important efforts in the environmental management made
In recent years, Yemen still lacks adequate institutional and regulatory frameworks to
manage Its natural resources, disseminate Infonnation concerning environmental
issues, and fully promote public awareness and participation. Environmental
management Is considered in an intemational context.. Yemen's has international
treaties and obligations are ratified by the Government.

         и to develop and implement sustainable management and monitoring programs
           for water resources, land resources and agriculture. coastat zones,
           biodiversity and waste;                                               "- ".
         и to develop a desertification combating program;
         и to provide energy substitution;
         и to use environment friendly technology and enhancement of renewable energy
           resources;
         и to implement environmental Impact assessment for projects; and
         и to increase public awareness in aU environmental fields.


2.6.3.     Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRSP)
A key issue confronting Yemen is poverty. and the linkage with environmental
degradation, and resources depletion occurring in both rural and urban areas. There
are high levels of poverty In rural areas, people are living below subsistence levees and
they are using soils, forest and other resources at rates exceeding sustainable limits for
recovery and renewal. The poor have no other option than to adopt short-term survivpl
strategies. Also. Yemen's urban areas IllUstrate tne mutually reinforcing effects Of
poverty and environmental degradation. Foremost among the envtronmentallssues are
the healh problems resulting from substandard living conditions (like that do not shiefd
them from) human extracts, domestic refuse and other wastes.

The Govemment of Yemen adopted the poverty Reduction Strategy (PRSP) which
reflects the roJe of the environment for the living standard of the people in Yemen
whare the poor ant primarily reliant on the environment for their livelihood. They are
directly affected by the methods by which the environmental resources are exploited.


Draft EIA Report of Ohamar City                                                       14
AUQust, 2009
The Govemment has therefore decided that the following environmental pondes are to
be strengthened within the PRSP:

         и enhance the technical capacities of relevant institutions to develop
           comprehensive environment as wen as development projects and programs
           relying on community participation;                            '''7;' :

         и develop a legal framework;
         и institutional empowennent of local organization;
         и cany out field studies to assess environmental conditions;
         и find Incentives accompanying awareness campaign;
         и provide job opportunities through environmental projects; and
         и finance projects that provide soft loans for the poor.

In spite of the emphasis given to environmental issues in the PRSP, the budget
allocated by the GOY does not allow significant environmental measures to be taken in
support of poverty eradication. Out of the total planned spending of YR 446,384 Million
for the period 2003-2005, environmental measures will only amount to some 0.8% of
the PRSP budget.

2.6.4.     Gender Policies
Yemen's constitution dedares equal rights and obligation for men and women, and
makes discrimination on the basis of sex lUegal; the govemment capacity to enforce
such laws is weak, mostly due to inadequacy of the administrative apparatus. New
laws Introduced since Yemeni unification provide women more security rightS, yet
without effective enforcement, these are virtually ineffectual.

In 1997, the govemment adopted the Yemeni Women's National Strategy. Among the
institutions established to work on women's issues Is the women National Committee.
Its duties include cooperating with local, regional and intemational organizations
involved in women's projects, conducting studies relating to women, contributing to
women's legal awarenass, and hOlding workshops and conferences. Its effectiveness is
hampered, however, by lack of adequate fUnding; abSence of coordination at a nationfII
level. unavailability of data disaggregated by gender. and ambiguity of Its goals.


2.7.       Legal Framework

EIA. in Yemen, is enabled by the Environment Protection Law No 26 of 1995 (EPl).
The provisions of this framework law are implemented through Executive Regulations
(By-Law 148--2000), Issued by a decree Of the Council of Ministers. A copy of the
Environmental Protection Law for the year 1995 and the EIA regulations for the y"r
2000 are attached in Annex 1 of this report.

The objectives of the Environment Protection Law are to protect the environment, to
reduce pollution, and to protect natural resources, society, human health, and living
beings from activities that damage the environment. In addition, the law is designed to
protect the national environment from acti\'fties practiced beyond the national
boundaries and to implement international commitments ratified by the Republic of
Yemen in relation to environmentsl protection, control of pollution, conservation of

 natural resources, and the protection of such globally important environmental
 ele~.nt$aJ Ull Q~fW layer and climatic Changes.

 To     a~oKf'fJtu~ i~e     environmental effects, the law stipulates the Incorporation of
 environmental considerations in economic development of plans at all level and stages
 of planning for all sectors. It requires the preparation of environmental assessment for

                                          i 'Ii
 all projects proposed by the govemment, public, private and cooperative agencies, and
 foreign companies. No licenses are                Issued fCLProjects t.hat degrade the
 environment However. there is as . ... . $,.ulatotV""framework. to support the
 implementation of the Environment Protection Law and the provisiOn of undertaking
tenvironmental assessment for projects is not enforced.

 The competent bodies for EIA defined in the EPL ate those government bodies with
 powers under other legislation to approve development activities (e.g. line Ministries).
 The Envkonmental Protection CouncIl (EPC) was given the responsibility of
 coordinating the actMtles of the competent bodies, and providing advice to them. In
 2001 the Government of Yemen transfelTBd the EPC into the Environmental Protection
 Autholfty (EPA).

 Environmental Standards and SpecifICations have been prepared by the former EPC
 as amexes to the Executive Regulation., covering potable water quality, wastewater
 quality for agrtculture, and ambient air quality, emissions, noise, biodiversity and
 protected areas. These Include standard application forms intended for use by all
 relevent government bodies.


 2.B.      Envlronmentallnstituttons

 In the following sections there will be elaboration about the inStitutions that are worklng
 directly or indirectly in the environmental sector with more focus on the water and
 sanitation activities in the country.

 }r      Ministry of Water and Environment (MWE)

The Ministry of Water and Environment was created after the election of April 2003.
The estabfishment of MWE came as a natural development of previous governmentel
efforts on the Water supply and Sanitation Sector Reform. The efforts started with
establishment of the High Water Council (HWC) in 19808, than foIk:Jtl.led by
establishment of the National water Resources Authority (NWRA) in 1995. The effort
continued and actions are taken in the direction of decentralization of urban Water
Supply and sanitation Sedor through the transformation of eligible branches of the
National water and Senitation Authority (NWSA).

Previously, the Ministry of Tourism and Environment (MOTE), created in 2001 with tf1e
Republican Decree 32912001-Art1de II. had the mandate to manage and orga~e
tourism, with aim of developing It into a prosperous Industry resource, while
maintaining and protecting the environment. figure 2.1 is schematic organizational
chart of the MWE.

    1990 with the responsibility of coordinating the activities of the competent and providing
    advises to them to manage and protect the environment. It was an official organ of the
    state under the Council of Ministers on the implementation of the Environment
    Protection Law.

    The aim of the EPA is to ensure that all planned investments in Yemen are sustainable
    and not in conflict with long-tenn preservation of the country's national resources which
    are the very basis of its economic and human development.

             prtvate sedors In different environmental protection fields.

   ,       Other Government Agencies (Indirectly related to environmental protection)

  At present there is no formal role for other Government agencies in enforcing the EIA
  process, whether it is through the central Government or though local governments cd
  the different governorates. Most of their roles are in development plamingt especially
  In Initiating and Implementing projects and in securing support through the Govemor
  where appropriate.

  Ministries and Govemment bodies, which may have indirect relationship with EIA
  implementation. are listed here below:

       ~   Ministry of Agriculture .nd irrigation (MAl):

,.,~he Ministry of Agriculture and Irrtgation has overall responsibility In overseeing the
,li"rrigation sector. Imgatlon consumes about 90% of the national available water
    resources.

       t/National Water Resource Authortty (NWRA):

  establshed In 1995, the NWRA is charged with the responsibHIty of managing,
  developing, exploiting, end conserving the nation's water resources. NWRA is
  mandated to prepare basin plans and monitor water resources.

 the Ministry of Public Heafth (MOPH) Is responSible for the overall health sector in
 Yemen, including financing, planning, regulation, management, and provision of health
 servtces at all levels (specialized hospitals, district and rural hospitals, governorate
 hospitals, health centers and primary health care in MOPH facilities either free of
 charge, if indigent, or by paying subsidized user charges for better-off collected at the
 faciity level. Yemen does not have a compulsory health insurance system.

  )-        Non - Governmental Organizations

 There Is evidence, however, of the expanding role of the private sedor and NGO in the
 delivery of basic serviCes to the citizens and preserving the environment. Thefe is at
 present no official role of NGOs In EIA, except as organized for international funding
 bodies. There are however a reasonable number of Yemeni NGOs that, in theory. may
 have a role to play In the EIA process. A list of NGOs that may refevant to the Walel
 and Wastewater Project Is shown in the table belO'N.

 Unfortunately. the I'$ality is that just these NGOs can be considered truly effedive, ~r
 potentlalty, as key players in the EIA process or the implementation of a sector strategy
 in the tutUI'$. There are a number of reasons for this:

        1. The NGOs are in fad qusst-govemment agencies in Yemen therefore cannot
           be viewed as independent bodies by the poputation. tn effect any NGO
           operating effectively Is perceived to do so only as a resuft of through
           government patronage.

2.9.       International Conventions
Yemen has International environmental law obligations that are directly A!tIated to its
national environmental planning activities and concern the marine and terrestrial
habitats. Many of the global treaties were rattfIed by either the farmer YAR. and/or by
the fanner PORY. According to Unification Declaration. the international conventions
ratified in this manner remain valid and are applicable to the whole nation.

Intematlonal conventions have little or direct Impad on environmental conditions In
poor developed countries. In most cases the international law is implemented through
the national local legislation and en'itronmental actions, various scenarios may OCCI,If
which Is depending on each particular case:

       и The international agreement may already cover by similar national laws. and
         no particular adIon is required to be taken to comply with the international
         agreement.
       и The implementation of the international law may be in line with national
         legislation
       и International agraements may require new or substantially changed national
         laws and new compliance measures.

Yemen is signatory of more than 20 international conventions on environmental issue,s.
Those relevant for the environmental are indicated In the table below.

    The Yemeni Government is concerned about effective implementation and
    enforcement of international obligations in light of national financial and managerial
    constrains. Some conventions heve not been signed by Yemen due to the tack of
    funds. Ratification of other international environmental conwntions has been slow for
    similar reasons. These Include:




-
          и Convention on the conservation Of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (Bonn.
               1997).
          и    Convention on international Trade in Endangered Species of \MId Fauna and
               Flora-CITES, (Washington, D.C. 1973).
          и    Convention on Wetlands of Intemational Importance EspeciaHy as Waterfowl
               Habitat (Ramsar. 1971).

    Implementation of intematlonal treaty obligations Invariably becomes the responslbillt)
    of national agency. It appears that, in Yemen, the capaciUes of national agencies to
    deal with the technical complexities and reporting requirements of intemational
    agreements are not sufficient. For example, Yernen is a party to several international
    conventions dealing with the marine environment, but does not haw sufficient capacity
    to enforce them. It is clear that the assignment of new responsibilities to an agency te
    imptement internationaf treaties should go parallel with technical strengthening Of thE
    agency concerned.                       '

2.10.      Environmental Application

This section includes information on Yemen's environmental application. The
Govemment general environmental policy provides a broad framework for
environmental management, and there ara some regulations, policies and laws
available in hand which should be improved and Implanted to environmental application
for the water sector.

Th~nt Government policy in water sector is mainly to solve the probfem Of water
scarcity, stop the depletion Of groundwater aquifers, and provide a clean drinking water
for urban and rural population, management and planning for wastewater treatment
and the water resources. The govemment of Yemen has developed different projects
and programs with international links to achieve these policies. An example Of these
efforts is a project to strengthen water resources management capabilities aimed at
national capacity-buildings in water re80WC8S management to establish an
independent and natural water resources authority. This projed funded by UNDPI and
the Netherlands Government.

Other important issues related    to   the water sedor were embodied in laws and
regulations as follows:

        и Water Law No. 3312002
        и Project for Water standards and Reuse. 1999
        и Environmental Protection Law 2611995
        и Established EPA, by Decree 60112005 and the framework By-Law 14812000
        и Additional regulations, procedures and specifications.

The lack of proper sedoral environmental policy, enforcing regulations and
imptementation of management programs which are the main driver to the
development of the water sector. Copies of Water ~~I E;P~ -~i~~~~

               3.6.2.       Non-Oomestlc Demand
               Non-Oomestic water demand (Commercial, Institutional and Industrial) will be set to
               15% of the domestic demand along the project horizon after the agreement with the

-              Client of the project.

               3.5.3.      Water Losses
               The water losses in distribution system are estimated to about 40%. The excessive
               leakages in old distribution system and damaged/non working water meters are the two
               main reasons for this high figure of water loss percentage.

               3.5.4.      Required water Production
               According to the required water demand the following yields, 8S summarized in the
               table below, will be required based on 20 hrs daily pumping.

The average well production for Dhamar existing wells was calculated to amount of
220 IIsec assuming the wefl operation duration to 2Ohrslday. The total daily production
capacities of the 14 existing water wellS are about 15,840 rna/day, the accumulative
number of needed wells are three. sewn and eleven wells for the years 2015. 2020
and 2025 respectively.

It is evident from the above table that additional water production source/s will be
required with a combined produdion capacity of 7,816 rrr/dayor 110 Vsee.
At present only about 163 Vs is pumped from eight production wells in Samah well field
and 57 Vsee Is supposed to be pumped from other six existing wells, a total of 220 Vs
will be available for domestic water suppty.
To make up for the deficit supply of 110 I/sec by the year 2025, quantity of addltlonal
water supply can be taken from the following proposed well sites according to the
results of exploratory wells.
      и 3 wells near Ohamar University
      и 3 wells in Samah well field
       и 2 wells between Ohamar and Yareem
      и 3 wells near Dhamar Town

The second implementation phase up to year 2025 will require well points discharging
329 lis at 20 hours daily pumping.


3.6.     Proposed Water Supply System

The water supply system of Ohamar in 2025 is visualized as:

Two new supply ground reservoirs will be added in the present system baled on ont
supply ntHNOir. one of the two new reservoirs will be constructed to the north of
Dhamar city at Hanan Mountain. The reservoir will have a water storage capacity of
        3
6000 m и This reservoir will be used to serve the Northem and Northиwestem areas (If
Dhamar. The second proposed ntServoir will be constructed at a hiD located at the
southem part of Dhamar city and it will have a water storage capacity of 6700m3. This
reHrvoir will be used to serve South and South-westem antas of city. The third
proposed reHrvoir will be constructed ~ to the existing eastern reservoir and it
will have a water storage capacity of 5000 m3и This reservoir In addition to the existing
6000 nf reservoir wtll be uled to serve the rest of Ohamar city. Addition" 11 wells
shall be drilled, to supply the north and south reservoirs.

The Dhamar existing water dl&UibuUon network will be rehabilitated and extended to
provide connections for aN consumers of the newly developed areas of the Urban
Center. The nature of further extensions to the system will depend on the town
planning layouts to be developed in future.

For this purpose. a new reservoir of 5000 m3 capacity is proposed to augment thf,
existing storage capacity (8000 m:; of the eastem reservoir. In addition, construction of
2 new reservoirs of capacities of 6000 m3 and 8700 m3 is proposed at the north and
south areas of Dhamar city respectively.

3.7.3.     Transmission and Distribution Mains
The transmission main will convey water under pressure from the well fleld up to the
proposed storage reservOir, whereas, the distribution mains will convey water b)

3.9.     Proposed Wastewater Collection System
The preliminary design will concentrate on the rehabilitation of the existing networ1< in
Dhamar to improve the situation of the frequently plugged sections. With help of field
investigations breakage, blockage and overflows, problematic pipe sections will be
identified. These will have to be replaced In the frame of the rehabflitation measures.
Acconting to hydraulic requirements, the existing sewer pipes will be examined for
suitability for future operation.

Furthermore, the extension of sewage networ1< wiN Indude the new populated areas In
the centers that will be connected to the sewage collectors.

The design calculations for both, sewer networtcs and wastewater treatment plant will
be performed, so that they can hande the generated wastewater from the project area
tm the horizon year 2025. The general layout of the sewer networks and the pipe sizing
will be determined according to the population distribution in the project area, a8
expected in year 2025 (according to TOR requirement).

3.9.1.   Design Outline of Wastewater Collection
In order to ensure an environmentally sound wastewater diSCharge within the Centers,
the following measures concerning the instalation of the wastewater disposal facilities
will be Implemented:
       и Rehabilitation and construction of the sewerage trunk system In defined
          priority areas,
       и Rehabflitation and construction of seeondary network in defined priority areas,
       и Rehabilitation Of the existing Wa5tewater Treatment Plant (tagoon&) and
          treatment structures with extensions to overcome the Increase of the received
          quantity,         _!'z        r                  r:
      и Extension of wastewater system in Dhamar to c6vefffle rema~иr~n'l'!Ag!l!area!!!ls,!I

In tenns of alignment. the Consultant's concept for the jnstaDation of the trunk sewers
is based on the concept developed and gained from the Dhamar future extension
directions with all growth factors.

The topographical feature of Dhamar city is flatness. with average elevation of 2,400 _ _
2,450 mas!. Therefore the sewer networks shall be laid with appropriate slope and wIt~
minimum depth If needed to avoid deep trenching and pumping stations. Accordingly
Dhamar wastewater will be conveyed to the treatment plant through main trunk line and
sewer networtc.

4.2.3.   Water and Sanitation
The water supply system of Ohamar depends on the groundwater resources. The main
aquifer in Ohamar area Is the complex system of aUuvium deposits and the tertiary
volcanic rocks. which are hydraulically interconnected. Local water resources are of
good quality. Recharge to the aquffer may cover the domestic water needs if
groundwater is used only for domestic water supply. Spacing of the pumping wells to
be driUed in the future has to be well located to prevent any interfaces of cones б
depression in the pumping wells. The city has 14 wells in total. Out of these total 14
wells 12 wells are opemtional while the remaining two are not connected to the system.
Eight of the total 12 operational wetls are located in Samah well field. TIle drflling of
these wells carried out in 1990 with average depth of 150m. The Samah field wells are

4.2.4. ExIsting Water Supply Syatam
Most of the existing water supply network in Dhamar was constructed in two Stages i-e
Stage-1 and Stage-2. Works under stage-1 were completed In 1967, whemas stage-2
started In 1985 and completed in yesr 1992. The stage-1 was constructed by USAlD,
while the stage-2 works was constructed utilizing funds from Arab and OPEC Funds as
well as the Government of Yemen. The works under stage-2 were being Implemented
and operated by NWSA through Ohamar branch, and were put into service in 1992.

The works carried out under stage-1 comprises construction of distribution network
inside old city area by laying 25mm-100mm diameter GMS pipes. However WSSLC
Ohamar replaced about 50 % of the pipes previousty laid under stage-1. There are stili
about 15km length of distribution network lines of old net work and some more lines
laid afterwards, which needed replacement. WSSLC expected replacement of all pipes
by the year 201C

Under Stage-2, in addition to construction of Ground water reservoir. 0.1 pipes of
diameters from 100mm to 500mm and house connection GMS pipes (with polythene
sheets wrapping) of diameters from %- to 2- were laid. After completion of stage-2, the
extension in distribution network and provision of house connections (using %" to 4-
diameter pipes) has been carried out from time to timt"

The city is supplied continuous water supply [I-e 24 hrs supply). The Ea: n areas of
city are fed from a Ground water Reservoir located in an area caRed Thamar. The
water storage capacity of Thamar reservoir Is 6,000 m3 and elevation Is 2,473 masl. A
Ductile Iron (0.1) distribution main of 500mm diameter carry water from reservoir to the
distribution network. This happen to be the only working Ground Resef'llOir In the city
that is supplying water under gravity. Moreover, chlorination unit is provided B
reservoir site that is in operation since september 2007.

There also exists a non functional OIH reservoir near the Ground reservoir site. thE
height and storage capacity of OIH Tank are 12m and 140 m3 , respectively.

In addition to Eastern areas of city, there are four villages (The mar, Mawaheb,
Lakhmah. and Kharabah) which AJeeive water from Thamar water reservoir. The total
estimated population of these four villages is around 20,000. Due to priority of water
supply to city, the villages are not getting water In required quantity and pressure from
the east reservoir, but actually they are connected direcUy to the main SOO mm
transmission line.

The reservoir Itself is being fed from 8 weDs located In Samah well field. 'le south -
eastern part of Ohamar. The city is also supplied water through direct pumpIng through
existing operational 4 wells located In Shuaibah, Jodad, Hanan and sports stadium.
Two mof9 wells, are located in the we"'southern part of city at AJ..Mehlah and At-
Q0800r, However they are not connected to network yet.

Presently. there is a project under construction which is aiming at enhancing the watel
networt< of the west area of Ohamar city. Under the project, wells located at Sport
stadium, Al-Mehlah, Al-Qosoor and Shuaibah will be connected to distribution network
of western area of the city. The project indudes construction of one O/H balancing
Reservoir (capaclty=1  oonr  and height=12m) in South of city at a place caUed Roms. In
addition to above. the project a'so includes construction of a pu"" station (piping,
building and pumps) and laying of 1OOmm to 250mm diameter transmission lines.

    The number of subscribers of water supply to-date stands at 15.199 that cover about
    76% of city area. The house connections are still in good CO~$.

    As slated before, the water supply system of Ohamar was oonSfruded in tWo stages;
    the first stage was completed in 1967 and stiR in operation which means that part of the
    distribution network is very old. almost 38 years old which explains the high percentage
    of water losses .(almost 40%). The water system was extended thro,l:l,h, the second ~
    stage by NWSA In 1992.                                                      . &kSiH1 "

    From Thamar reselVoir. water is conveyed by gravity through a 01 Distribution main of
    DN 500, with a total length of 4.20 km to the distribution system of Ohamar city. The
    distribution network is made of 01 (diameter 100 mm - 400 mm) and GMS (ON 50-
    150 mm).The total pipe-length of the distribution system Is about 64 km. Most of the
    GMS pipes of ON 5()..1oo Installed In the old city are deteriorated and should be
    replaced by new and bigger diameter pipes.

    The existing distribution network constructed during the second stage (In 1992) Is stli
    In good condition. All new and good condition pipes will be integrated In the system; the
    deteriorated and small diameters pipe will be either replaced or reinforced respectively.
    Detail of Ohamar Existing piping system is summarized below.

have no wastewater collection system and cesspits are being used to coReet
wastewater.
Recently, a small sewer laying contract was being undertaken in ~mmar's western
areas of Omer berI AJ-Khatab and Al-Methaq. Under the contract, about 2.5 km of
200mm and 160mm diameters of uPVC pipes were laid. The works under this
contracts completed in 200ft The source of financing for this contract. was arranged
from Social fund.
The number of sewer house connections Is around 8660, covering about 42% of the
town population. The detail of e.xisting wastewater network i-e lengths, diameters and

4.3.2.   Fauna
As mentioned eal1ler, the Governorate hosted a remarkable number of sheep heads.
cows and camels. The intensity Of the Uvestock in the City Of Dhamar is very minimal
due to the type Of works and jobs that are available. Most of the animals are distributed
within the villages and sub villages of the Governorate. There are no records Of
endangered fauna spedes at the City.

4.3.3.   Archaeology
Dhamar Governorate IS considered the geographical center of the (Hymirit Civilization).
Dhamar has ruled in the past by strong King of Hymirit tribes whose name was Dhamar
Ali. Ohamar is famous and known by natural minerai baths which are considered an
important feature in Yemen whioh are located in Annes district and AI Hassin village.

It was a trade center and situated in the middle of the country. It connects all Yemeni

third age. On the other hand the southern part is malnty composed of clay and sill that
are mixed with sand.

Ohamar area has been eJCPosed to several seismic events. One major earthquake tOQk
place in 1982, which is considered the mBior earthquake that hit Yemen in the modem
age. One of the major natural faults is passing through north eastem part of the city.
This fault is seismicaly active. On the other hand, in the northern. the north western
and western sides of the city Ieft..tateraI- normal faults can be noticed. As for . .
southern side of the city. it is considered an active area from seismic point of view,
where medium and week seismic actMties are still recoded to date, which renders ~
area as one of the active seismic areas in Yemen. The next figure shows Dha"..r

emphasis on speciaf characteristics of the Yemeni environment,

The guidelines for conducting environmental impacts assessments and the
the semening to define the project category have been discussed in this chapter. This
guideline was developed under phase I of this study, named the Sectoral
Environmental Assessment guidelines for the water and sanitation sector. It was
                                                                                        Of

our analytical procedures at this stage,


5.2.     Objectives

Scoping and screening wll consist of identifying, for each potential project, the major
issues, the appropriate environmental category, and establishing a plan for appropriate
environmental assessment (EA) studies. It will also serve to heighten awareness of
these issues among stakeholders and Institutes, which are engaged In the plarming
process. Scoplng will rely on baseline data drawn from refated reports, lnteMews,
photographs and maps, supplemented by on-site Inspection and initial stakeholder
consultations.

The main objective of these guidelines Is to set procedural framework for thtr
Environmentalists in Yemen to perform scteening, and sooping before deeiding on the
level of Environmental Impact Assessment of any Water and Sanitation Project.

These guidelines will be adopted for conducting the specific EIA studies of the 14
urban centers that were mentioned in chapter one of this report. The terms of reference
Of this study requested the Consultant to develop the EIA guidelines In phase I and
consider it during the preparation of the EIA in phase II.

The process of EIA study started with dec::kllng on the category of the project based on
the anttclpated negative Impacts. The figure on the next page shows the recommended
steps toward dec::kling the level of EIA that need to be done, and usually called
screening process. Categories of -A". -B", "Cи and "FI- are related to the Worid Bank
categorization that gave an indication of the sensitivity of the project from the
environmental aspects. The highest environmentally sensitive is "A" and the lowest is
"FI", All the details of these categories are attached in annex 2 of this Report.

After deciding on the Category, which Is an indication of the level of detals for Iha
environmental Impact assessment study; the second step will be to check thE"

    Environmental category checklist is prepared to support the environmental
    categorization process and focuses on the antidpated environmental potential impacts
    of the Water and Sanitation projects in refatlon to the following aspects:

           и Land Resources;
           и Hydrology, Hydrogeology and Water Resources Management;
           и   Air Quality and Noise Nuisance;

           и Socio-Economic and Cultural Resources

    category Checklist was developed to assists the deciSion maker to pin point on the
    category level of the project as shown in the next table. The definition of these
    categories is shown In after it.

For the case of Dhamar water and sanitation projects, it will be considered as a
Category -A- project. which may produce negatiVe Impacts on the project area and
surroundings and requires an EM? at the end of the process.


6.4.       Policy Frameworks and selected Safegcards

After deciding on the Category of the project (A), the neld step will be to select the
applicable safeguard policies that need to be ccnsidered for each category. For the
case of Dhamar, these policies are related to:

         и Resettlement Policy Framework, (OP 4.12)
         и Natural Habitats Policy Framework. (OP 4.04)
         и Cultural Resources Framework, (OPN 11.03, being revised 8S OP 4.11)

These safeguard polk:ies were quoted from Wortd Bank Guidelines and ara applicable
forthe case of water sector in Yemen.


5.5.       Details of safeguard Policies
5.5.1.     Resettlement
Projects involving "major" resettJement Impacts (i.e. more than 200 aft'ected persons)
shaH automatlc:ally be placed under environmental screening categoty (A) and will
require a Full Resettlement Plan a8 defined in the ResetUement Policy Fran18'NOrk.
Projects with less than 200 aft'ected persons shall be placed under categoty (8) and
Will require an Abbreviated Resetttament Plan.

The failure to take into account potential iovok.lntary resetUement in the devefoped
urban centers can increase the risk of hardship, poverty and increase environmental
damage. The over all policy objectives ant:

   a) Resettlement must be avoided or minimized, explorfng alternative project
      designs;

Draft SA Report of Ohamar City
Auaust, 2009
    b) Where it is unavoidable, resetUement must be handled as a sustainable
       development program, where the displaced persons are given the opportunity
       to join the planning and implementation process, while sharing the benefits of
       the project; and                 . , r:~:             :., ,'/\~w.
    c) Displaced persons I1'IJst be assisted to Improve their lIVelihOod' or, at Iea$l,

        assets or access to assets such as land, or Qii) loss of income sources or
        means of livelihood whether or not the affected persons I1'IJst move to another
        location, such as shops or productive activities on the land; or
      и The involuntary restriction of access to legaly designated partes or protected
        areas resulUng In adverse impacts on the livelihood of displaced persons.

The Yemeni Constitution (Article 7.c and 20) protects citizens from general
expropriation of their assets. The Public utility Owner Law (111995) (PUOL), gives
governmental bodies (inclUding govemors) the right to acquire private property for
projects in the public interest. Yemeni law stresses that land expropriation is to take
place only in the event that no suitable land alternatives exist that are already in the
public domain. In such Instances the legal provisions for expropriation and
compensation will apply. The law describes the foRewing:

      и Situation of legal expropriatiOn
      и Procedures for expropriation; and
      и The agency responslbte for vatuation of the compensation and its procedures.

Former regulations exist for land acquisition in urban areas, under Executive
Regulations (280/1997) to the urban Planning Law (No. 20/1995). In th. . casea.
compensation for land taken for urban streets and services when the percentage crt'
area taken for public interest exceeds 25" of the property affected. When such
conditions apply, the procedures and documentation requinlmentl ant quite extensive
and time consuming and, as a result, the Law Is effectively applied in 10% of the cases.

Land-taking practice is rooted in longstanding traditional community-level agreements
geared to awid the expensive, time consuming litigations set up for the urban areas
which also trigger legal proceedings warranted by eMf law and the judicial proceSIJ.
The current practice consists In negotiating land donation by affected landowners,
and/or in-kind property replacement for buildings and structures, under the tutelage of
local authorities, generally the Govemor..

Assets developed by private individuals on Government land are not compensated in
case of demolition for public interest. Religious trust land (waqIJ is oonsidered public
property. However, assets devetoped by, and the benel'lts accruing to the priVate
renters of weqf states are liable to oompensation, including houses, taRns and shope.
The facilities built on trust land for aociaI or religious purposes, such as community
-   buildings; mosques and graveyards must be relocated and reconstructed in the nearest
    ~ntswt      place.

    In c:Oitcf~sIon,formal provisions for land elq)roprtatJon existlif Yemen.'   11~t=lasи
    over land acquisition have been settled through consultations and Internal
    arrangements, which generally involves land donation and/or In-kind compenaation for
    loss of buildings. This practice provides guidelines for implementing a Resettlement
    Policy for UWSSP's Inconsistent with the WorkJ Bank OP 4.12 policy.

    5.5.2.   Natural Habitats
    Any proposed project located, or is adjacent to, any of the "dedared", "proposed
    declared" protected areas In Yemen shan automatically be placed in Envilonmental
    category A and wiH require to carry out a detaHed impact assessment and
    environmental Management Plan (EMp). a8 defined in the Natural Habitats Policy
    Framewolt (BP 4.(4), as part of tile overall EA Projects whose proposed alignment
    pass through or are adjacent to any "non-crltical habitat" may be category A or B
    depending on its relative locatiOn and ment of anticipated Impacts, but in either C8SO
    need to carry out the detailed impact assessment and EMP.

    The proposed projeCts could significantly convert or degrade natural habftats. which
    would trigger the application of the Natural Habitats Safeguard Policy, Operational
    Policy (OP) 4.04.

    Due the unknown exact location of the UWSSPs facilities, it is not possible to
    detennine which WSSP projed could significanUy convert or degrade natural habitats
    and thus It is necessary to establish a Natural Habitats Poflcy Framework (NHPF)
    which provides procedural guidelines on how to address thi~ ~y(l.i1.1 is occurred:

    The conservation of natural habitats is essential to   safeg~id 'ffietp ~!e
                                                                          biodiversity
    and to maintain environmental services and produds for human society and for Iong~
    tenn sustainable development.

     International Donors do not support projects invoMng the significant conversion Of
    natural habitats unless there are no feasible aJternatiws for the project and Is sitting,
    and comprehensive analysis demonstrates that overall benefits from the project
    substantially outweigh the environmental costs. if the environmental a$S8ssment
    Indicates that a project would convert or degrade natural habitats, the project must
    include mitigation measures acceptable to the donors. Such mitigation measures
    include, as appropriate, minimizing habitat loIS (e.g. strategic habitat nRention and
    post-development restoration) and establishing and maintaining an ecoi0gicaliy stmllar
    protected area The Wor1d Bank accepts other forms of mitigation measures onfy when

In general terms. the EPL provides for the establishment of individual protected ar&$s

The EPL does not designate one institution which Is to be responsible for protected
areas and ecosystems. However. it provides that the Environmental Protection Council
(EPC) (Now the Environmental Proteetion AuthOrity (EPA╗ or any other concerned
body" may present to the Councft of Mlnillers a proposal for establishing a protected
area. and that the Council of Ministers will designate the entity competent to adninlster-
the area.

The state has absolute sovereignty over and ownership of an natural resources,
according to Micle e of the Constltliion. Wild animals are owned by the state and not
by the owner of the land on which they are found. WrId plants enjoy the same
protection as wild animals, in accordance with the Constitution, even if grown on
plivatety owned land.
The EPL provtdes broad protedlon for wild animal species In..situ. The law states that
all fauna and binis that haw their habitat in Yemeni territory, as well as migratory binis,
have legal protection. Protection for wild plant species is limited to rare and endemic
spedes

The EPL does not address the issue of managing wild species generally. It allocates
responSibility for controlling hunting to the EPC (now EPA) or any other competent
body". The Fishenes Law gives the Minister of Fishef1es broad powers in the field of
protecting, developing and managing fisheries and mar1ne resources.

5.5.3.    Cultural Resoun:ea
Projects, whose proposed alignment runs through or is adjacent to any physical cultural
resources shall tngger the applcatJon of the Cultural Resources Policy Framework, b\rt
may be placed in Environmental category A or B. depending on the relative location
and extent of anticipated impacts.

Cultural Resources Policy Framework, which provtdes procedural guidelnes on how to
address this issue should the case arise. This Policy Framework has been developed
in conformance with OP 4.04.

The World Bank seeks to agSl countnes to manage their physical cuttural resources
and to avoid or mitigate adverse impacts of development projects on these resources.
To this end, the Bank seeks to:

      и   Enaure that physk:al cultural resources likely to be impacted by Bank...financed
          projects are identified, protected and managed
      и Ensure that project design and implementation comply with the lJOimwer's
        national laws governing the pmteclton of physical cultural resources
      и Conbibute to the development of the BoIT'OW9r's capacity to identify. protect
        and manage physical cultural resources.
      и The Bank nonnally declines to finance projects that wiU significantly damage
        nonreplicable cultural resources and assists only those projects that are sited
        or designed so as to prevent such damage.

The Bank assists in the protection and enhancement of cultural properties encountered
in Bank-financed projects, rather than leaving that protection to chance. In some cases,

    To ensure that all the environmental issues wiD be adequately addressed in the EIA

    environmental impacts are adequately addressed.

   In this case, scoping will determine those potentially signiftcant enVironmentallmpacta
  .likely to result from the construction and operations of the proposed water and
  'wastewater projects. The outcome of scopIng would be that only potentiaHy signiftcant
  "impads associated with the project are carried forward to the assessment stage. Ottt,r
   impacts would therefore not be asaessed further. Scoping ensures that mitigation and
   enhancement measures are ldentifted at an eatly stage tn the design process for a
   project.. This should minimize the need for subsequent design amendments and ensure
   that environmental protection and su&talnability are key factors in the design.     ...~

       7.1.       General

       Potential environmental impacts of the project including direct/Jndfrect impacts were
       identified and quantified for the proposed project. The environmental impact
       assessments trigged the fawrable and unfavorable impacts of the program from
       design, construction to the operational phases, as well as resettlements and land
       acquisition. Also, the assessment of the project significance such as likelihood,
       intensity risk, and environmentat sensitivity, which was identified with emphasis on
       special features of the Yemeni environment. Once implemented and put into operation
       the project will have several positive Impacts on Dhamar inhabitants. Some of the
       positive Impacts are;
              1. Improving the water supply ability to Dhamar residents and meet the increasing
                 demand on drinking watel
              2. Supplying good quality drinking water quality and improving the inhabitants'
                 sanitation level
      ;1 3. Increasing the wastewater coIection rate which will protect the city water
                 resources and protecting the tegional Environment
           4. Through the construction of infrastructure, investment environment is improved,
              channels of financial Investment are opened up, and employment opportunity is
                 increased. и- ---WIiiWS    aJ% tE"C       Nи~;~~         "и0 '-'-'''''';'''   .:Ц4~

      positive Impacts, direct or indirect Impacts and then the impacts due to the ~r
      supply project in comparison with the sanitation and wastewater treatment
      components. It is obvious that there are shared impads of both the water and
      sanitation projects, but stiR the sanitation and wastewater treatment will generate more
      negative impacts dur1ng construction and operation.

      These impacts will Influence specifically the proposed project area and widely tne
      surrounded areas. Specific non-technical impacts are also relevant and induded as a

 periods. The same is applied for the services of wastewater colection where the
 benefidaly groups will face problems in discharging their wastewater.
 The same problem will face the existing wastewater treatment plant which win be
 intenupted by the expansion project whfch wID temporarily stop the process of
 treatment and will generate effluents with poor quality and cannot be reused for
 irrigation purposes, All such c~ need to be studied during the preparation of
 the project in order to d8'!8lop the required mitigation measures.

 )0     Traffic InfBrrerBritea
 " is expected that there will be traffic Interferences mainly at the minor roads due to the
 activities of excavation and laying the pipelines in the trenches. It Is known that Dhamar
 city has narrow roads networks which make It more vulnerable for the possible
 interferences during the construction periodI. That will impact negatively on thft traffic
 flow and the necessary time for the l'elidents to reach their destinations. This will only
 valid duling the construc:tion of the project and not during the operational stage.
 Construction mey result in short-term impacts to local area residents. and uses of
 route. It is expected that traffic circutatton wi. be negatively Impacted In the cfty during
 the construction phase particutarly In the aANIs where new sewer systems will be laid,
 such as In the southern BANI of the city (Figure 5.1), Traffic problems wi. occur when
 traffic must be moved through or around construction areas. This may lead to trafl'ic
 accidents and injuries, especially in the nslTOW streets of the city. The proposed
 construction activities will also ntsuH In tempol1llry congestion and longer travef times
 through the project area.       ~~~     >(";   и    . : .';~~;.-~"

 }lo     Misuse of the unlnNded wa8lewatar during construction
  It Is witnessed at present that the farmers are not eontroHed by the responsible
  ageodes for the reuse of treated wastewater for the restricted irrigation. This problem
 'wiN be scaled up during the expansion of the WVVTP and the untreated quantities of
~emuents towarcls the farming activities. This will cause more health probfems and
lpossible contamination on the products Ihat win be cultivated such as the vegetables.
  AI. the reuse activities should be STOPED durfngr!!l~~nДipn of thS'trutment PIII:d.
                                                              -:-

to avoid any mliUie Oftfie emuents for the Irrigation purposes. Controlling the fanning
activities downstream the plant is a must and should be taken at the higher level of the
local govemment.

> Noise Impact
Noise will typically be an impact associated with the project as long as It is in
construction. H Is not envisaged that the dally operational activities will Increase to
such an extent that the noise levels wi. present a problem. Noise In significantly
sensitive social areas can be mitigated by benns and barriers where and If requifed.
The operation noise could bring about Increased noise levels, which could disturb local
residences, hospitals, schools or wildlife. Given anticipated operational level, this
Impact Is conSidered to be relatively low, excem where sites Impact on hospitals.
schools or identified sensitive habltata.
The Contractor shall adopt the best practicable means of minimizing noise during
construction. For any particular job, the quietest available plant/and or machinery shall
be used. Equipment such as jack hammers, compressors, percussion tools and
vehicles shall be fitted with attenuation facilities. Pneumatic drills and other noisy
equipment shaH not be used during days of rest or after normal working hours without
the consent of the Beneftciary Committee.

}10    Ambient Air Quality
Construction of water and wastewater facilities could release various types of gaset
which could bother the community IMng in the adjacent areas. Therefore, some people
will leave these areas to stay far away from the created gases.
The Contractor shall take all necearary measures to    "mit pollution from dust and any
wind blown materials during the works and such measures are:
Utilize water spraying during openllion on sections within 500 m of settlements or
crops.
Trucks leaving the site are properly cove"", to prevent discharge of dust, rocks, sand,
etc.
Crushers and other equipment conform to relevant dust emission control.
Stored materials and heaps should preferably be located away from communities and
farmlandS; or materials should be covered and fugitive dust should be effectively
controlled during delivery.

> NuIsance Dust
The major effects on air quality during construction would be an increase in suspended
particles from excavation as well as movement of heavy machinery and trucks over
unpaved roads and the resultant dust caused when all traffic Is diverted to I.I1paved
detours. Many of these operations will take place near the populated settlements.
During construction, fugitive dust emisSions would occur from construction vehIcles and
equipment creating dust. Wind erosion may occur during the construction phase In
areas where the soil Is disturbed along the road widening. The dust depoallon dlstanqe
Is estimated to be from 30-100 m of the activity with a wind velocity of 15 kmph (4m11l).
The average wind speed in Dhamar Is less than 4 mis, which implies that in most of t~e
cases the dust impact, wlH not be extended beyond the construction area (maximum 30
m from the excavated trench).
The deta~ed project design should ensure, that the cut and fill operations wlH be
minimal to extent possible. However, these operations will include earthwork which will
cause disturbance to the eXisting soil in case of cut operations and hauUng of borrow
materials from borrow pits and crusher plants.

)0    Debrta and Sludge Dispoeal
During the construction activities there will be debris, construction waste and sludge
production and other wastes from the labors and the works itself. This requires facilities
for disposal otherwise may pose health risk to the community and pollution of
environment. The destination of trarttpOrtlng the wastes should be agreed upon with
the local govemment and the municipality of the City.

                          activities it Is expected that                will happen in
terms of interruption of the current eervices to the communities such as the electricity
and communications. The districts which wiD be under construction will face posaible

      compounds and machinery
                                         d.....spills from the contractor sites

The source of these pollutants Is uncontrofled as a result of disposing liquid or solid
construction waste. Examples of theBe wastes are uncontrolled disposal of construction
wastewater, spillage of diesel. oil and grease. Excessive pollutants discharge hal
adverse impacts on surface water and SOils. Therefore, tbe contactor has to consider
certain measures to minimize such pollutants from reaching the water body and soil
Locating a high-risk zone with a concrete pavement will help In reducing the 1rJ1)8Ct of
diesel, oil and grease spills.

)0    Cross drainage and scour eft'ecta close to the existing WWTP
The constructions fill should be adequately compaded, and in faling to do so large
number of scour points can be cntated around the sites facility especially the WNTP,
which will eventually erode the various sites. The area around the plant Is a domain for
possible floods during rainy seasons which require flood protection measures durinr
the construdlon period.

)-    Safety Risk
During the construction phase, there may be an increased risk of accidents involvln"
local population, especially children. These may result from one or combination of the
following:
      и unauthorized access to a construction site
      и   conftlct with construction equipment and vehicle
      и poor site safety
      и Inadequate management oftbe Site

By their nature construction activities generate elevafiQ liMis-Qf iiCCkfif6 risks.
However, three factors suggest that the Impads from the proposed projects activities



in some cases are ciearty dangerous and equaly Importantly importari         that
                                                                                off site
aaMUes, such as construction traffic, are poorly controlled.
Extensive linear construction sites along urban streets, especially when the roads are
narrow (which is the case in Dhamar) will expose large part of population, especially
children who use streets as a play area to risk.

Draft EIA Report of Dhamar City                                                       80
AUQust. 2009
Therefore. there will be an unavoidable increase In truck tratTic during construction of
the roads infrastructures. There is thus a potential safety Issue associated wi.th
increase In traffic In the vicinity of residential areas and schools. There are also riskS
aSSOCiated with infrastructure construction like Injunes, failing etc. among the
population and workers.

)- orr Site Work.
As a result of the project construction activities, five types of offsite activities an
expected to be developed off site to support the project:

    1. Project omces and camps
       Project otftces may be located anywhere wtthin Dhamar, i~1 tiny UI Ole elelStlflY
       blildlngs. Labor camps win be established so as to accommodate the labor
       force. This camp will produce a wastewater, solid waste that should be
       collected and managed property.

    2. Materials stockpUes
       The construction activities wit require malerfafs such as pipes, valves and
       backflJl materials. The88 materials should be stockpiled In a special sHe
       aSSigned by the client. Although, there should not be any hazardous materials,
       there will be some impacts like dust and noise from the stock pile site.

    3. Pre-Cast. Yard
       Manholes of different sizes wil be p/'8catt on I ~I precast yard. A yard will
       therefore be required to store cement. chemicals (Oil) for mould, which is
       expected to generate 01 spills. At the yard, materials will be stockpiled, sud1 al
       cement, gravel and sand, which are expected to produce a dust. The site will
       require access to adequate water supply and suitable road access

    4. Equipment maintenance and cleaning workshop
       The contractor will establish a workshop for 1he equipment maintenance and
       cleaning. Such a WOfUhop win produce a threat to the environment. as a result
       of chemicals that will be produced at the workshop. on and chemical spHIs ~y
       lead to contamination of soil and groundwater.

    5. Borrow materials and aggregates
       Aggregate and backfill materials will be needed for the construction activities.

During construction. worXers are expected to come from the project areas and other
places. In this case there I. a posaIbIIty of additional health risk related to mlgrwtt
worX8I'S. project activtties may afso lead to creation of stagnant water in borrow Pits
and quanies associated with the consbudion aclMties like hmnels and drainaqe
systems. The resultant stagnant water bodies will favor breeding of mosquitoes, &rIalls,
and other disease 'II'8Clors.

During construction, a lot of solid wastes will be produced at the campsites as well as
at the construction sites. The type of waate to be produced indudes scrapers, domestic
waste, boxes, building materials etc.

 The construction wor1(ers will require proper IUJl"\Il'cffs for sanitation. The wastes to be
 produced necessitate providing gOOd and hygienic sanitation fadlities otherwise the
 waste produced. if not handled carefully would affect the aesthetic conditions of the
 area. Depending on the mode of management, construction camps may experience
 poor sanitation and poor waste disposal problem~;'и

   The construction of related infrastructure might be perceived as a degradation of the
 'landscape. Other construction activities may also lead to landscape dlsfiguralion.
, Upcoming construction structures excavations, presence of soil mounds, machinery
   and ether materials on the construction site will be visually intrusive.
 J The presence of borrow pits, quarries and other structures in the project area are
   vtsually Intrusive. The slgnlftcance of the visual Intrusion wll, however, depend on
 . several characteristics including the size, shape and color of the installations and their
   location on the site.         ]

 )0    HiStorical and Cullurallmpacts
 There are several sites of cultural 81d heritage value In [)hamar govemorate. However,
 in [)hamar city there are two main sites of hiStorical value. The grand mosque and the
 Shamsi School in AJJarajeesh Area. The two aites may be affected during the
 excavation and construction works by the heavy equipment. Therefore, the contractor
 'should avoid using eqUipment that will generate vibration which will threaten the
  stability of such sites.
  Since Dhemer witnessed several civlizations durtng the history. during the construction
  actlvHies and opening the trenches, hllloncal and cuftural sites and monument. may
  be discovered underground. Construction activity can destroy those monuments if no
  measure Is undertaken by the contractor to protect those sites by inviting the hlatorical

 Dhamar. However, since the Yemeni Environment Protection Law prohibits any actiVlY
 which affects the qumltity and quality of the vegetation cover, the designer should to try
 to avoid any area that ;s covered with vegetatJon to be included within the construc:tIQn

'-~   Negative impact can be considered as those Induced by the activity, either directly or
      indiredly. that caused negafjve impacts to the local communities and receiving
      environment during the operational phase. Utually such impacts are very minimized
      and scaled due to the type of service project like water supply and sanitation services.
      In the following sedlon there wi. be etaboration on the anticipated impads due to the
      water and sanitation projects.

      7.3.1.   Negative impacts during operation phase due to the water development
               and supply project
      The expected negative impacts due to the water project during the operation phase are
      very limited and all considered as low significant Impacts:

)0-   Misuse of the treated wastewater and Increase of sludge quantities durtng
      operation
It is witnessed at present that the fanners are not controHed by the responsible
agencies for the reuse of treated wastewater for the restricted irrigation. This problem
wm be scaled up during the expansion of the WWT? and the untreated quantities of
effluents towards the farming activities. This will cause more health problems and
possfble contamination on the products that will be cultivated such as the vegetables.

It is. the responsibility of the Client in cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture and
the local government to control the reuse of the treated wasteWater for the restricted
irrigatiOn and take the necessary measures to implement the regulations.

The other side of the problem is the expected remalUbie increase in the quantities of
sludge that will be genenrted from the plant after expansion. Wrth the absence of
sludge disposal and treatment plan, this Wl1' be a big chaUenge for the operator and
may cause negative impacts on the environment and the residents dose to the plant.

,      GeneratiOn of odor and flies from the WWTP
It is expected that the new and expanded WNTP will generate more odors and flies
during the operation. This will be worse in case of improper operation and maintenance
of the plant. Since the dominant wind direction is eastern and as the WWTP is located
in the north east side of the city of Ohemar (see Figure below), some parts of the
northern side of the city will be suffering from WNTP odor. Necessary measures
should be taken to minimize this impact on the surrounding residents and downstream
farmers and the labors at the plant.

           Dhamar City




╗ Aesthetic Impact
The construction of related infrastructure might be perceived as a degradatiOn of the
landscape. Other construction activities may also lead to landscape disfiguration.

Upcoming construction structures excavations, presence of soil mounds, machinery
and other materials on the construction site wilt be visually intrusive.
The presence of borrow pits, quarries and other stfl.lCtt.lreS In the project BAta aAt
visually intrusive. The significance of the visual Intrusion will, however, depend on
several characteristics including the size, shape and color of the installations and their
location on the site,

)0     Lowering the value of the areas around the WWTP
It is expected that due to the expansion of the WVVTP at the same location of the
existing plant, there will be more drop on the values of the lands and properties of the
residents close to the plant. This will cause negative social impacts on the residents.

)it    More Immigration from the peri-urban areas towards the city due to the
       high level of services
Due to the improvement of the facilities in the water and sanitation sectors at the city. it
is expected that there will be more Immigration from the peri-urban areas towards the
city. This will cause more pressure on delivering the services of water, sanitation and
other basic nesds such as eIectridty and communication. Unless the peri-utban areas
were considered In the future with development projects, there will be no doubt of
continuous immigration from the peri urban and rural areas towards the urbanized
areas.

joo     More burden on tha responsibilities of tha local corporation of water and
        sanitation In terms of operation and maintenance
With the additional facilities at the city in terms of water and sanitation and treatment
facilities, there wIN be more pressure on the local corporation to operate and maintain
the facilities in the proper way. This will require additional human resources and
equipments to conduct the necessary responsibHitles.


,     More burden on the new subscribers in terms of service bUIs
The new subsaibers for the watar and sanitation wilt be facing incremental payments
due to the new selVices of water and sanitation. The scaJe of this problem wilJ depend
on the ability to pay and the willingness to pay. The citizens will recognize that the
generated benefits of using the new serviceS will suffice any coats that Will pay during
the operatiOn of the services.


7.4.     Anticipated Positive Impacts for the water and sanitation projects during
         the construction and operation phase

The construction of the water and sanitation projects will generate numerous
environmental and socio-economlc benefits which are expected to occur following the
construction and implementation of the project. The generated benefits during the
operation phase are more than the benefits during the construction phase.

7.4.1.      Benefits due to the construction of the water development and supply
            projects
Such benefits are:
         и Creation of more jobs for the local communities during the construction and
           operation phase.
         и Social welfare and economic improvement
         и Upgrading and rehabilitation of current water and wastewater infrastructure
         и Improve standard of living of the residents due to the new services.
         и Improve health of the residents due to providing potable and reduce water-
           borne diseases;
         и Creation more business for the shops, restaurants and hotels owners during
           the construction phase.

7.4.2.      Anticipated Positive Environmental Impacts of the sanitation and
            wastewater treatment projects during construction and operation phase
Positive impact can be considered as those induced by the activity, either directly or
indirectly, that provides benefits to the local communities and receiving environment
during the constructIon and operation phase. These can be Identified as the following:

         и Employment creation through involving local labour forces in the activities
           during the construction and operation periods;
         и Providing more quantities Of treated wastewater for more restricted irrigation
           activities.
         и Reuse possibilities of treated wastewater and improving the vegetation
           coverage due to the incremental quantities of treated wastewater.
         и Social welfare and economic improvement
         и Upgrading and rehabHitatlon of current sanitation and wastewater treatment
           infrastructure;
         и Improve standard of living Of the residents due to the new services.
         и Improve health of the residents due to providing proper sanitation facilities and
           phasing out the septic tanks;
         и Creation more business for the shops, restaurants and hotels owners dur1ng
           the construction phase.

These impacts are discussed In more details in the fOllOwing paragraphs:

In the following paragraphs there wlh be more elaboration on the anticipated benefits of
constructing the water and sanitation projecls in the city.

,     SociaJ WeW... and Economlca' Jmprovement
There is a tremendous positive impact in terms of socio-economic development since
the project is aiming at improving the current infrastructure to low and medium-income
areas where access this facility Is not avaBabie. As the implementation of the project
will contribute to the employment of the local community, there will be lignificant

improvement in the welfare of the households as most of the casual workers shall
come from the area.
Another positive impact is enhancing the water supply Infrastructure in the project area
and provides good quality water which will impaa positively through the improvement
of pubNc health conditions and In terms of minimizing the probabilities of Ulness
accidents due to water borne diseases. That wi" save a lot of lives and reduce the
number of patients and so the number of deaths in the project's region.

,.      Upgrading and Rehabilitation of Cunent Infrastructure
The project wilt upgrade the existing Infrastructure to an acceptalHe standard level
through constructing a water supply network. water storage facUlties. sanitation
facilities and wastewater treatment plant. This will maintain a good water quality with
the necessary quantities for the residents along the day. It should be noted that the
new water supply regime should be accompanied by public awareness campaigns for
promoting the ways of rational uses of water.
From the other side the new sanitation and treatment facilities will improve the
standards of services at the City which will have remarkable positive impacts on the
residents.

).      Employment Creation
The implementation of the project will create more permanent jobs for operating the
facilities. It is expected that the Client wiD hire more technical staff to operate and
manage the extensiOn of the water supply system. Also the project will assist in the
dissemination and transfer of knowledge and modem technology from the Consultant
and Contractor side to the Client side.

)r     SociallmpUcations - Health
Due to the improper taped water supply for parts of the project districts, water borne
diseases were reported In high levels In the City such as Typhoid and Diarrhea mainly
for the infants (1-4) years old. The delivery of good water quality through dosed water
system will remarkably scale down the number of cases and patients due to the bed
water quality. That will improve the standard of life and suffice the worries of the
famnies regarding the possible itlness due to their current water resources. Also, this
witt improve the water quality after improving the wastewater facilities,
The introduction of the _nttatlon system will phase out the use of septic tanks which
are considered as a hot spots and sources of contamination of the residents. This will
have positive impacts on the residents from the health aspects and financial aspects
through saving the costs Of discharging their septic tanks.

).    Treated wastewater reuse availability and improving the Flora of the project
      area
It is expected that the additional treated wastewater to the farmers will enable them 10
reuse more quantities for their irrigation aCtivities which entail restricted farming and
producing more productS. That will positively impact the green areas and improve the
flora of the project areas.

    CHAPTER 8~            PROPOSED MlTIGATJON MEASURES

    Environmental management is concerned with the implementation of the proposed
    mitigation and preventive measures that are necessary 10 minimize or offset adverse
    Impacts and to enhance beneficial impacts. In order to be effective. environmental
    management plan must be fully integrated within the overall project management
    efforts at all levels, which itself should be aimed at providing a high level of quality
    contro' , leading to a project which has been property designed and constructed and
    functions effectively throughout its Me.
    The key players in the imp4ementation of the mitigation measures are the COntractor to
    be appointed to undertake the construction works, the Client and the Engineer. The
    Environmental Control Officer (ECO) Will ensure and monitor the implementation of the
    Environmental Management Plan (EMP).
    The mitigation measures of this study will be presented in the form of impact matrix that
    shows the type of the anticipated negative impact, the level of significance and the
    duration and the proposed mitigation measures.


    8.1.         Impact Matrix

    The following evaluation matrices are used to show the possible impacts of the
    proposed project components on the environment and the proposed mitigation
    measures. The chapter will be divided into two main parts; the first is related to the
    water development and supply project and the second for the santlation and treatment
    projects. Under eath of these projects. the mitigations will be divided based on the
    phase of the project; either construction or operatIOn. These proposed mitigations are
    the core of the environmental management plan which is considered as a binding
    document for the Client and the contractor and part of the tender documents that need
    to be implemented during the construction and operation of the project.

Mitigation measures are presented in the assessment tables in the coming pages.

Table 8.1      Mitigation Measures - Changes in water regime




It Is anticipated that the existing water supply services and the wastewater collection in
addition to the treatment facilities wiD be interrupted due to the construction of the new
projects. This will result with water cuts for certain districts during the construction
periods. All such challenges need to be studied during the preparation of the project in
order to develop the required mitigation measures.




                                                                           Short term

Steps to avoid water pipeline damage should be take. This includes providing the
contractor with water main as built drawing. and Implementing inspection pits before the
commencement of excavation works. local corporation should start a plan of delivery
for the citizens during the water cut durations. The plan should minimize the duration of
water cut and provide water tankers and altematlves for the citizens. Water tankers
should be subsidized by the LC to minimize the over prices of the water tankers owners.
A public awareness campaigns should be started before starting the construction at
each of the districts to aware the citizens of the possible water cuts and the expected
periods of the cut

Table 8.2      Mitigation Measures - Traffic Interference




 It is expected that there will be trafllc intefferenees mainly at the minor roads due to the
 activities of excavation and laying the pipelines in the ditches. It is known that Dhamar
 city has narrow roads networks which make It more wlnerable for the possible
 interferences during the construction periods. That will impact negatively on the traffic
 flow and the necessary time for the reSidents to reach their destinies. This will only valid
 during the construction of the project and not during the operational stage.




                           The impact will be of short duration. limited to   Short
                           periods of construction

                           The impact will have high significance


 A project construction phasing plan and appropriate traffic control plan would be
 developed as part of the final design to coordinate construction activities and minimize
 disruption of traffic flow. The Contractor should wort with the Client on proposing a
 traffic plan for the roads that will be Impacted and closed in order to find alternative
 roads and detours. ThIs should be done before starting the construction of the project
 and in coordination with the traffic department and the local government.

 A local campaigns should be started for the citizens to aware them about the changes in
 the traffic routes and the alternative travel opportunities. Proper sings and signals to
 direct and guide the drivers through detours should be in place, so as to minimize the
 travel time and traffic congestions.

 It is expected that there will be traffic interferences mainly at the minor roads due to the
 activities of excavation and laying the pipelines in the ditches, It Is known that Dhamar
 cit has narrow roads networks which make it more wlnerable for the possible
 interferences dumg the construcIIon penods. That will impact negatively on the traffic
 flow and the necessary time for the residents to reach their de$tiniea, This will only valid
 during the construction of the project and not during the operational stage,




                        The impact will be of short duration, limited to

 The Contractor should work with the Client on proposing a traffic plan for the roads that
 will be Impacted and closed in order to find alternative roads and detours. This should
 be done before starting the construction of the project and in coordination with the traffic
 department and the local govemment.

 A local campaigns Should be started for the citizens to aware them about the changes in
 the traffic routes and the alternativeS. In order to minimize the duration of interrupting

 It is witnessed at present that the farmers are not controlled by the responsible agencies
 for the reuse of treated wastewater for the restricted irrigation. This problem will be
 scaled up during the expansion of the WWfP and the untreated quantities of effluents
 towards the farming actfvitjes. This will cause more health problems and possible
 contamination on the products that will be cultivated such as the vegetables.
 The other side of the problem Is the expected remarkable increase in the quantities of
 sludge that will be generated from the plant after expansion.


                         The Impact will be within the limit of project area

                        The intensity of the impact is high



 It is the responsibility of the Client io cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture and the
 local govemment to control the reuse of the treated wastewater for the restricted
 irrigation and take the necessary measures to Implement the regulations. Public
 campaigns for the farmers regarding the reuse possibHities and the restrictions of
 misusing this water for unrestricted irrigation should be planned and organized.
 With the absence of sludge disposal and treatment plan, this will be a big challenge for
 the operator and may cause negative impacts on the environment and the residents
 close to the plant.

 It is expected that the new and expanded WWfP will generate more odors and flies
 dUring the operatlon. This will be worse in case of Improper operation and maintenance
 of the plant. Necessary measures should be taken to minimize this impact on the
 surrounding residents and downstream farmers and the labors at the plant.
 It is expected that due to the expansion of the WWfP at the same location of the
 existing plant, there wtll be more drop on the values of the lands and properties of the
 reSidents close to the plant. This will cause negative social impacts on the residents.

 The operation and malnlenance of the WWTP after expansion should be the first priority
 for the LC operational plan. This wiN reduce the possibilities of generating odors and
 flies. A water quality labOratory should be introduced at the 'WWTP to check the quality
 of file effluents to ensure the proper process of the treatment.

9.1.        General

Environmental management is concerned with the implementation of the proposed
mitigation and preventive measures that are necessary to minimize or offset adverse
Impacts and ta enhance beneficial impacts, In Older to be effectiVe, environmental
management plan must be fully integrated within the overaH project management
efforts at all levels, which itself should be aimed at providing a high level of quality
control, leading to a project which has been properly designed and constructed and
functions effectively throughout its life.

The EMP is a binding document and should be provided to the Contractor asa stand
alone document and as part of the tender documents for the construction of the
projects.

The key players in the implementation of the mHigation measures are the Contractor to
be appointed to undertake the construction WOlks,the Client and the Engineer. The
Environmental Control Officer (ECO) who will be employed by the Client. Ministry of
Water and Environment, will ensure and monitor the implementation of the
Environmental Management Plan (EMP),



9.1.1.      Responsibilities of the Client representative (eCO)
The ECO will have the foHOWing responsibilities:

         и To advise the Engineer on the interpretation and enforcement of the
           environ mental requirements;
         и To monitor the Implementation of the EM? by the concerned parties;
         и To provide environmental information whenever Its necessary;
         и TO undertake regular inspections and submit reports on the Contractor's
           compliance;
         и With the environmental requirements; these reports shall be copied to the
           Employer and Engineer; and
         и To demarcate particular sensitive areas and pass Instructions through the
           Engineer concerning works in these areas.
         и To maintain the communicatlon among all the concerned parties including the
           local communities' representatives and NGOs.


9.1.2.     Responsibilities of the Contractor
The Cont.ractor shall:

         и Comply with the enVironmental requirements contained in this document;
       и Be familiar with the EM?;
       и Notify the    seo  and Engineer Immediately In the ewnt of any accidental
         infringements of the environmental requirements to enable appropriate
         remedial action to be taken;

         и Notify the ECO and Engineer. at least ten working days in advance, of any
           activity he has reason to beHeve may have significant negative impacts. so
           that mitigatory measures may be implemented timeously;
         и Ensure environmental awareness among his employees and subcontractors
           so that they are fully aware of, and understand, the environmental
           requirements and the need for them;
         и Undertake rehabilftation of all antas affected by construction activities to
           restore them to their original states. as determined by the Engineer; and
         и Undertake the required works within the designated working areas.

9.1.3.       Responsibilities of the Engineer
The Engineer shall:

      и Be familiar with the contents of ttIe EMP;
      и Monitor the Contractor's compliance With the environmental requirements on a
        daily basis and enforce compliance (the ECO should be monitoring
        compliance on a daity basis, in most Instances I is difficult for the Engineer to
        monitor these tasks effectively as well as the construction programme);
      и Communicate to the contractor the advice of the ECO and the contents of the
        ECO reports and issue site instructions giving effect to the ECO requirements
        where appficable;
      и Communicate to the ECO, at least ten working days In advance, any proposed
        actions which may have negative impacts on the environment;
      и Designate all working areas;
      и Communicate to the ECO any infringements of the enVironmental
        requirements and accompany the ECO during site inspections;
      и Maintain a record of complaints from the public and communicate these to the
        Employer and Contractor;
      и Facilitate communication tietween all role players in the interest of effective
        environmental management; and
      и Monitor the compliance ofthe COntractor through the ECO reports.

  are set out in the sections as follows:

  9.3.1.        Pre-construetion Phase
  ╗        Management
  Prior to contractor mobilization and the commencement of construction. environmental
  management activities will include:

          и Ensuring that the financing agency requirements relating to EIA are complied
                with. In this case the World Bank requirement is complied with;
          и
          и Preparation of tender and construction contract documents which contains
            appropriate clauses to allow the control of impacts arising from construction

the contract documents to allow control of actions by the contractors, which are
potentially damaging the environments.

9.3.2.     Construction Phase
,     Management
Most of the project environmental management activities will be carried out during the
construction phase. since this is when most impacts can be expected to lise
Management will largely be concentrated on controlling impacts Which may result from
actions of the contractor, through enforcement of the construction contract clauses
related to protection of the environment as a whole and the components within it. In this
respect, it is Important to recognize that success of the mitigation of construction
impacts can only be achieved If environmental protection measures, as set out in the
construction contract. are properly enforced.

OveraU primary responsibility for environmental management during construction will
be vested in the Project Engineer as to be defined in the construction contract. The
ECO to be appointed by the Client will in liaison with the ward councils make sure that,
implementation of this project taking into account among others, the findings of
Environmental Assessment.

).       Monitoring
Environmental monitoring during construction phase will comprise two principal groups
of activlUes:

Review of the contractors' site environmental plans, method statements and temporally
works designs to ensure that environmental protection measures specified In the
contract documents have been given due consideration in their preparation and, that
the contractors' proposals will provide an acceptable level of Impacts control. The
contractor has to prepare site environmental plans and these reviewed by the Project
Engineer;

Systematic observation on a day~to-day basls of all site activities and the contractors'
offsite faciflties, as a check that the contract requirements relating to environmental
matters are In fact being complied with. and that no unforeseen impacts are occurring.
These activities will be fully integrated with the construction supervision and monitoring
aellvities to be carried out. Primary responsibility for ensuring that an adequate level of
environmental monitoring is carried out will be vested in the power of the Project
Engineer as defined in the construction contract. The Project Engineer from the Client's
side win coflaborate with ward councils and other stakeholders to execute the project.
Site staff, under the direction of a Project Engineer, will cany out aelual monitoring on a
day-tO-day basis.

It is recommended that the Project Engineer should delegate specific responsibilities
for day-to-day site environmental monitoring matters to one of his subordinates to be
carried out as an integral part of r,is site supervision activities, in coordination with
ECO. To avoid the problems which often occur, responsibilities should be clearly
defined and allocated. However, the Project Engineer will still retain overall
responsibiHties for environmental matters, and this should be reflected in the contract
document.

Majority of monitoring will comprise visual observation, carried out at the same time as
the engineering monitoring adMtles. Site inspection will take place with the emphasis

     on early identification of any environmental problems and the initiation of suitable
     remedial actions. Where remedial actions have been required on the part of contractor,
     further checks will need to be made to ensure that these are actually being
     implemented to the agreed schedule and in the required form, As experience of the
     principle problem areas is gained, attention will be concentrated on locations and
     actMtJes which are known to be the most troublesome, with a lower frequency of
     inspections at problem-tree locations. Nevertheless. each part of the site needs to be
     formally inspected from an environmental view point at least once every month. The
     Client will decide on the appropriate course of action to be taken in cases where
     unsatisfactory reports are received from the field staff regarding environmental matters.

     In addition to visual observation, it is particularly important that monitoring should also
     include limited Informal questioning of people who live near to the woJ1ci:sites. since they
     may be aware of matters Which are unsatisfadory, but which may not be readily
     apparent or recognized during normal site inspection and viSits.

     9.3.3.       Operation and Maintenance Phase
     ╗    Management
     FollOwing completion of construction of the works, it is expected that there will be a six
     months maintenance period, during which the contractor will be responsible for
     remedying any defects in the works. The Client win be responsible for supervising
     maintenance during this period, including responsibility for environmental management
     and monitoring. However, it is anticipated that, these latter aspects will be restricted to
     ensuring that site ofearance has been carried out in an acceptable manner.

     Long-term continued enjoyment of the benefits arising from implementation of the
     wot1<s wilt only be achieved If effective routine and periodic maintenance Is carried out
     in a timely manner. Environmental management and monitoring in a long run will be
     vested to the local community in Project areas.


     9.4.         Environmental Monitoring

     Environmental monitoring as an essential tool In relation to environmental management
     which will provide the basis For rational management decisions regarding impact
     control. Compliance monitoring (which checks whether prescribed actions have been
     carried out, usually by means of inspection or enquiries). as opposed to effects
     monitOring (whIch records the consequences of activities on one or more
     environmental components, and usually involves physiCal measurement of selected
     parameters or execution of survey, to eatablish the nature and extent of Induced
     changes), is the most appropriate for the present project.

     The monitoring programme will be undertaken with the objective to:

            и Check on whether mitigation measures have actually been adopted. and are
              proving effective in practice:
            и Provide a means whereby any impacts which were subject to uncertainty at
              the time of preparation of this EMP, or which were unforeseen, can be
              identified, and to provide a basis for formulating appropriate additional impact
              control measures; and

:~


     Draft EIA Report of Dhamar City                                                         128
     AUQust. 2009
         и Provide information on the actual nature and extent of key impacts and the
           effectiveness of mitigation measures which, through a feedback mechanism,
           can improve the planning and execution of future similar projects.

Environmental monitoring will involve the coDection of data and information pertaining
to project characteristics, quantities and functioning of environmental variables over
space and time. Environmental monitoring will be an integral part of the environmental
project management process. It win rationally complete the process that begins with
estab6shing the environmental baseline, carrying out the environmental impact
assessment, implementing of mitigation measures and finally monitoring the success of
those measures.

There are three basic forms of monitoring:

         и To check whether the implemented project is operating as planned;
         и   Compliance monitoring, which checks whether prescribed environmentai
             action plan have been carried out, usually by means of Inspection or enquiries;
             and
         и Effects monitoring, which records the consequences of activities on one or
           more environmental components and to establish the nature and extent of
           induced changes?


9.4.1.       Monitoring Activities
Environmental monitoring is envisioned as an important process in project
management. The monitoring programme wilt reveal changes and trends brought about
by presence and operations of the project. SUch information will be useful In the
formulation of sustainable project management, operations strategies and action plans.

The basic activities for a sound-monitoring programme should at least include the
following parameters:

      и      Collection and analysis of relevant environmental and social (health) data of
             the project area.
      и      Preparation of periodical reports on the environmental status of the project
             area and liaison with other agents and stakeholders.
      и      Identification of unexpected environmental impacts
      и      Formulation of counterиmeasures to mitigate against the unexpected negative
             impacts.

The Project Engineer will monitor the Contractor's performance in relation to the
environmental requirements on a daily basis. He will be assisted in his monitoring by
the ECO. The ECO shaD inspect the site on a regular basis. After such visits a report
will be submitted to the Engineer and the Employer. The reports will contain any
infringements of the environmental requirements. The reports may also aim at
anticipating problems and so alert the Contractor to potential environmental risks and
the appropriate action that may be taken. The Engineer will make the content of these
reports known to the Contractor. The ECO may undertake an Environmental Audit of
the works.

9.4.2.       Environmental Variables
In order to sustain a healthy environment in the project area, the project management
shOuld undertake to monitor the quality of the environment in project area and its
environs as a routine practice.

Monitoring will involve measurements, observations, evaluations, assessment and
reporting on the following variables during the construction and operation phases of the
programme:

         и   Natural resources regeneration/depletion (I.e. Changes in biodiversity);
         и   Soil erosion and siltation;
         и   Socio-economic changes;
         и   Reclamation activities;
         и   Health and working conditions,
         и   Pollution management:
         и   Waste management (Chemical spills, soil waste etc);
         и   Environmental awareness;
         и   Ground and surface water quality due to possible 011 and pollutant spills.

Samples witt have to be collected from the nearest point as quick as possible and
monitomd for the spilled compounds. For example. if a gasoline truck has an accident,
dissolved hydrocarbons will be measured. The above table shows examples of the
parameters that need to be checked.

The key stakeholders In undertaking environmental monitoring Include Client (NWSA).
LC, Ministry of Health, ECO and NGOs.

9.4.3.       Monitoring System
In the context of this project, the most crucial aspects of monitoring refer to maintaining
the safety measures on the new infrastructure facilities such as pipetines, valves and
storage tanks. That will entail the quality of the water that is supplied to the customers.
Monitoring for the project should at least include routine visual Inspection and flow
measurements and laboratory anaJysis.

9.5.        Environmental Cost

The environmental cost for implementing the mitigation measures should be involved in
the engineering design and being embodied In the engineering costs. The following
table entails the mitigation measures items with their related unit costs. These costs
were stemmed based on the market prices and the on-going construction projects in
Yemen.

CHAPTER 10:       PROCEDURES    FOR   IMPLEMENTATION                       OF       THE
                  ENVIROMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN

10.1.    Management Plan Concept

10.1.1. Introduction
This Environmental Management Plan (EMP) document describes mitigation measures
to be implemented duling the construction and rehabilitation phases of the project It is
partly prescriptive, Identifying specific people to undertake spedfic tasks, in order to
ensure that impacts on the environment are minimized.

This EMP Is seen as a 'living' document. Methodologies can be updated and improved
during implementation, as site conditions become clearer. However. the EMP attempts
to provide the most practicable methods to promote sound environmental management
during the construction and rehabilitation phases of the project. Some notes and
recommendations on the operational aspects are also included.

10.1.2. Environmental Control Officer
The Environmental Control Officer (ECO) Is the person involved with the development
project. responsible for monitoring the implementation of the environmental
management plan. 11 may be different parties during the different phases of the project.

This person should be employed by the local corporation in Dhamar. It must, however,
be a person with adequate technical and environmental knowtedge to understand and
Implement this management plan. The ECO may not be someone appointed by the
contractor or the engineer. The ECO must report to the developer.

The ECO has the authority to stop workS during construction if in his opinion there is a
serious threat to, or impact on the environment caused directly from the construction
operations. This authority is to be limited to emergency situations (see definitions)
where conSUltation with the engineer or developer Is not Immediately available.    'n
such work stoppage situations the ECO is to inform the engineer and developer of the
                                                                                      all

reasons for the stoppage as soon as possible.

Upon failure by the contractor or his employees to show adequate consideration to the
environmental aspects of this contract. the ECO may recommend to the engineer to
have the contractor's representatIVe or any employee(s) removed from the site Of work
suspended until ttle matter is remedied. No extension of time will be considered in the
case of such suspensions and all costs wilf be borne by the contractor.

10.1.3. Environmental Awareness Training for Site Personnel
All contractor teams involved in work on the devefopment are to be briefed on their
obligations towaras environmental controls and methodologies in terms of this EMP
prior to work commencing. The briefing will usually take the form of an on site talk and
demonstration by the ECO. The education I awareness programme should be aimed at
all levels of management within the contractor team,

Construction workers must also be given baste health awareness training to diminish
the spread of diseases in the project area.

Draft EtA Report of Dhamar City                                                      132
Auaust 2009
10.1.4. CommunIcation Procedute$ on Site
)00   Site Instruction Entries
The Site Instruction book entries will be used for the recording of general site
instructions as they relate to implementation of the EMP with regard to the worts on
site. It will also be used for the issuing of stop work orders for the purposes of
immediately halting any particular activities of the contractor in lieu of the
environmental risk that they may pose.

)00    ECO Diary Entries
The purpose of these entries will be to record the comments of the ECO as they relate
to activities on the site.

Each of these books must be available in duplicate, with copies for the Engineer and
ECO. These books should be available to the authorities for inspection or on request.
The contract site meeting minutes must reflect environmental queries, agreed actions
and dates of eventual compliance. These minutes form part of the offICial
environmental records on site.

)00    Method Statements
Method statements from the Contractor will be required for specific sensitive actions on
request of the authorities or ECO. A method statement forms the base Hne information
on which sensitive area WOIk takes pJace and is a "live document" in that modifications
are negotiated between the Contractor I Engineer and ECO, as circumstances unfold.
All method statements will form part of the EMP documentation and are subject to all
terms and conditions contained within the EMP main document.

A method statement describes the scope of the intended work in a step~by-step
description in order for the ECO and RE to understand the Contractors Intentions. This
wiJJ enable them to assist jn devising any mitigation measures, which would minimize
environmental impact during these tasks. For each instance wherein it is requested
that the Contractor submit a method statement to the satisfaction of the ECO, the
format should clear1y indicate the following:

What       Brief description of the work to be undertaken;

How        Detailed description of the process of work, methods and matenals;

Where      Desaiption/sketch map of the locality of work (if applicable); and

When       Sequencing of actions with commencement dates and completion date
           estimates.

The Contractor must submH the method statement before any particular construction
activity is due to start. Wort may not commence until the method statement has been
approved by the ECO.

10.1.5. Record Keeping
All records related to the implementation of this management plan (e.g. site Instruction
book, ECO diary, and method statements during construction and other EMP records
during operation) must be kept together in an office where it is safe and can be readily

Draft ElA Report of Dhamar City                                                      133
AUQust.2oo9
retrieved. These records should be kept for two years and should at any time be
available for scrutiny by any relevant authorities. It is recommended that photographs
are taken of the site prior to, during and immediately after construction as a visual
reference. These photographs should be stored with other recoros related to this EMP.

 10.1.6. Environmental Completion Statement
An Environmental Completion Statement is a report by the ECO to the relevant
authorities stating completion Of the construction of the project and compliance with the
EMP and conditions. This statement wilt be ISsued after a final external audit of EMP
implementation.

10.1.7. Institutional Matters
The ECO is responSIble for the dayиto-day implementation of the EMP. The ECO will
commiSSion external audits of EMP Implementation by an independent environmental
auditor on a bf..monthly basis during the construction period. This external auditor will
prepare a short audit report after each audit. These reports will be discussed at the
construction site meetings and will be retained for record keeping purposes.


10.2.         Site Establishment

10.2.1. Sensitive features and wetland areas

  ./        Cultural and Historical Elements

Before commencement of the clearing activity, the Contractor must familiarize himself
with the type and location of any sites of cultural or historical importance enumerated in
this report but shall not limit himself to those mentioned. The elements ultimately to be
affected can only be determined during construction.

The activities that are likely to resuH in these impacts include:

        и     Quarries and borrow areas
        и Contractors' yards. labour accommodation. etc
        и Storage
        и Access roads
        и New alignments and detours
        и Cuts and fils
        и Maintenance
        и Earthworks

The Contractor must then present the EnVironmental Control Officer (ECO) aa well as
the Resident Engineer (RE) with a layout of his works including haul roads, borrow
areas and construction camps and satisfy the ECC that the known elements mentioned
in this study are either avoided aftogether or, In the case of grave Sites, will und8fgo
translocation after thorough consultation With the affected communities and authorities.



Draft EfA Report of Dhamar City                                                       134
Auaust.2OO9
Special features demarcated on the maps or matrixes must be Identified and located.
Care must be taken to prevent accidental damage during the construction stage.
Workers on site must be informed about the possible consequences of inteffering with
these elements .

  .('   Gravesltes

The issue of transJocation of graves is an extremely sensitive one. There Is a strict
order of events, which must be adhered to.
The grave site Ifke the one in the northern part of the project area must be reported to
the RE who will then forward the information to the local Government.
The local Government and LC must then negotiate with the family of the deceased to
reach an agreement on e)(humatlon and reburial.

Once an agreement is reached, the exhumation and reburial must be pefformed in
accordance with the applicable rituals. It will be the duty of the contractor to supply
caskets, dig new graves and pefform the exhumation and reburial upon request by the
eMl authority. This wiD be over and above the cost of the ordinary contract
requirements.
It is recommended that all gravesttes remain In sito, and are avoided as far as possible,
through road rQalignment.
Gravesites or other sociaUy significant structures should be protected by means of
physical barriers both during construction and operation to prevent disturbance,
vandalism or destruction.

  ./    Responsibility of the Compensation I Resettlement Unit

Compensation/resettlement plans should be based on socio-economlc surveys
describing the full resource base of the affected population including income derived
from informal sector and non farm activities and from common property, the extent to
which the groups will experience total or partial loss of assets, and public infrastructure
and social services that will be affected.

Legal frameworks should be set up in consultation with the community including the
nature of compensation, in terms of the valuation methodology and the timing of
payment, the legal and administrative procedures applicable including the appeals
process and the normal tlrne--frame for such procedures.
Ensure the communHy participates in pfanningldevfsing the most appropriate means of
compensation. It Is important that the communities' needs flosses are identified rather
than assumed and are thereby appropriately compensated.

A list of names of affected famlJ1es should be compiled as earty as possible to prevent
an influx of Ineligible people claiming compensation.
Information relating to the raws and regufatfons affecting the valuation and
compensation of eUglbie families' households I businesses I goods needs to be
timeously disseminated.

Valuation of lOst assets shOuld be made at their replacement cost prior to the actual
move.
Assessment of cash compensation for property should be carried out in a wholly
transparent manner, resulting in payments, which truly reflect current rebulJding costs,
taking into account the Inevitable rise In buRding material prices, which occur when it is
known that compensation money win be available.

Draft EIA Report of Dhamar City                                                        135
AUQust, 2009
All affected persons should be freely allowed to salVage building materials, trees and
other assets on affected land as additional compensation for displacement.
Some types of loss such as access to public services, customers and suppliers cannot
easily be evaluated or compensated for in monetary terms. Attempts must therefore be
made to establish access to equivalent and cuHurally acceptable resources and
earning opportunities.

In the case of businesses, the compensation payments should be adjusted to take into
account any anticipated loss of income which may arise as a result of the need for
relocatiOn to a less suitable location away from the main centre of business activities.
Where replacement land is provided by the local authorities any costs associated with
registration of right-of-use should be met by the project, and clear right-of..yse titles
should be granted. In the case of agricultural land, the area of replacement land should
be determined so as to take into account productivity, so that crop production remains
as previously.

Resettlement plans shOUld be built around a development strategy and package aimed
at improving or at least restoring the economic base for those relocated.
Communities must be assisted in their efforts to improve their former Itving standards,
income earning capacity and production levels, or at least to restore them.
Absence of legal title to land by adversely affected population should not be a bar to
compensation.

Any payment due to the hosts for land or other assets provided to re-settlers should be
promptly rendered.
Conflicts between hosts and the resettled may devefop as Increased demands are
placed on land, services or if re-settlers are provided services and housing superior to
that of the hosts. COmpensation therefore needs to be equitable and the host
populations included In resettlement discussions.

  tI'   Cultivated Fields, Fences and livestock

Care should be taken to ensure that the minimum of cultivated fields and crops are
damaged by construction activities. If the pipelines route impacts on any cultiwted field
or cropland, fences and cultivated fields, then the owner thereof must be notified and
the compensation plan be implemented. Residents should be compensated for the loss
of crops and fences and care should be taken to ensure that the farmer is not worse of
as a result of the constructiOn activities.

Care must be taken during construction activities to ensure that livestock of the
surrounding communities are not InjUred or killed as a result of the construction
activities. If an inciefence occurs, then proper compensation procedures must be
Instituted.

  tI'   Accommodation of Traff'1C

The existing routes at the project areas are extensively used on a day-ta-day basis by
pedestrians, vehicle users as well as for the movement of stocks.
The contractor must accommodate vehicle, human and animal traffic safety at all times,
with the exception of limited short periOds duting trenching.
The contractor must demarcate and/or fence unsafe areas to ensure that access is
restricted until it is safe and must post appropriate signage to indicate these areas.


Draft EIA Report of Dhamar City                                                      136
AUQust.2009
The contractor must ensure that the surrounding community is educated about the
construction process and the constraints placed on them during this periOd .

  ./   Rehabilitation of Old Roads

Mer construction has been completed the oJd roads must be rehabilitated according to
the follOwing procedure.
The surface material that can be recovered must be removed from the top soil layers
and used as far as possible on the new alignment further on.
The compacted soil below must be ripped and covered with topsoil if available.



10.2.2. Clearing and Grubbing

  ./   Topsoil

The area of ground clearance should be minimized and sensitive alignments avoided,
such as those which include steep hillsides, as far as possible. Topsoil shall be cleared
of woody vegetation before ripping and removing.
The topSOil is regarded as the top 150mm of the soil profile Irrespective of the fertility
appearance or physical depth. Topsoil is to be stripped when it Is in as dry a condition
as possible in order to prevent compaction.

The topsoil, including the existing grass cover is to be shallowly ripped (only the depth
of the topsoil) before removal. This is to ensure that organic plant material, and the
natural seed base is included in the stripping process.
Soil stockpiles shall not be higher than 2.5 m or stored for a period longer than one
year. The slopes of soil atockpiles shalt not be steeper than 1 vertical to 2.5 horizontal.
No vehicles shall be allowed access onto the 'stockpiles after they have been placed.

stockpiles shall not be allowed to become contaminated with Oil. diesel, petrol, garbage
or any other material, which may inhibit the later growth of vegetation.
The contractor shall apply soil conservation measures to the stockpiles to prevent
erosion. This can include the use of erosion control fabric or grass seeding.

If at any stage of the clearing operations archaeological artifacts are unearthed or
identified the Archaeological Department is to be immediately contaded to conduct
thorough scientific investigation of the finds and worn suspended until further notice,

The contractor shall devise a soil conservation and stockpiling plan. to be approved by
the ECO and RE. which shall detail stockpile sizes, layout and form and means of
erosion (wind and water).

The rehabilitation measures to be taken for the area occupied by the stockpile. should
the ECO deem it necessary. ,

  ./   Fauna and flora

Natural vegetation shall be kept in as undisturbed a state as possibfe. SpeCial
attention shall be paid to preserve large trees and plant communities. Vegetation
removals as part of the development requirements are excluded.


Draft EIA Report of Dhamar City                                                        137
Auaust. 2009
All Incidents of harm to any animal or natural vegetation (apart from the agreed areas)
mllst be reported to the ECO.
Endemic vegetation species listed in the EIA Report must be relocated to a suitable
growing area, If at all possible.

  ./   Fencing

The purpose of fenced areas shalf be to sacure the contractor's equipment. Gravesites
should be fenced during construction and removed as soon as construction is finalized
in an area. Temporary demarcation with white boulders or other suitable materials such
as white painted wooden stakes of 1.5m high will be required to demarcate sensitive
environments as stipulated above to minimize construction damage. These boulders or
other materials must be removed when construction is finished .

  ./   Fencing at Construction campa

Fencing shall be suitably secured
     и No unauthorized pedestrian or vehicular access shall be allowed Into renced
        off-limits areas.
     и FenCing shall be kept neat at al times. The contractor shall be responsible for
        the maintenance of all fences. Breaches in the fenCing must be repaired
        immediately .
     и All exclusion areas are strictly out of bounds.
     и The clearing for permanent fencing shall be limited to the removal of shrubs
        within 1 m of the fence line. No grass cover and topsoil is to be removed within
        the fence alignment.
     и GalVanized diamond mesh fencing, preferably with a matte coating, will be
        used.

10.2.3. Construction camps
The planning and design for the Construction Camp must ensure that there is a
minimum impact on the environment. The plaCement of the construdion camp and
compensation must be negotiated With the landowner.
The construdion camps must be placed sway from residents in the surrounding area to
ensure that the cultural heritages of the communifiEts are not impacted upon by
construction workers from different CUltural baCkgrounds.
Local labors must be used as far as posSible to minimize cultural intrusion of the
communities in the area.

All site buildings shall be founded on a platform. Which wiN be compacted sub-soil or
screed slab. The screed slab and compacted sub-soil win be removed from site on
decommissioning Of the structures. All buildings will be souncffy built and wffl not posa a
danger to personnel. No fires may be allowed outside the constru<:tton area I
construction camp and adequate fire fighting equipment according to the tire hazard
during the construction period must be awUabie on site in good WOfklng order (at least
one type ABC (all purposa) 12.5 kg extinguisher).

Welding, gas cutting or cutting of metal will only be permitted inside the working areas.
Two separate activities fall under the scope of thiS EMP, namely the construction of a
series of bridges and a major link road.

Draft EIA Report of Dhamar City                                                        138
Auaust. 2009
The construction camp to be set up for the bridge construction is to be constructed in
one place for the duration of the construction activities and must be rehabilitated after
construction Is finished (permanent camp).
The construction of the road could involve either at two scenarios
      и A temporary camp which is moved as the road progresses
       и A set of camps, which are placed midway along their respective sections of
         road for the duration of the construction phase (permanent camps).


10.2.4. Site Building at Construction camps

  ./       Permanent and Temporary camps

       и AJI buitdings will be soundly built for the benefit Of the personnel. The relevant
         safety codes pertaining to inter aHa load, strudure, lighting, noise are
         appllcable here. Buildings should preferably be pre--fabricated or constructed
         of re-usablelrecyclable materials.
       и The structure and its alignment, must, as far as possible, reduce the need for
         air conditioning and artificial lighting but it must be ventilated property.
         Buildings should be built of materials, and aligned In such a way as to
         minimize the visual Impad.
       и Temporary site building footprints are to be rehabilitated and re-vegetated. to
         the satiSfaction of the eco, when construction is complete .

          the ideal profile for re--vegemtion purposes lies between 1:3 and 1:4
        и Steep slopes should be protected against erosion with soil stabfflzatlon
          mechanisms. The proposed method Is detailed under storm water Drainage.
          If the upper slope of the cut face is likety to be unstable, leading to rock fall,
          then it must be stabiUzed as soon as possible to prevent erosion.
        и 00 not cut slopes and embankments to an angle greater than the natural
          angle of repose for the focal soif type.
        и Bare rock on cut embankments, must not be top soiled, but only stabilized.

10.3.2. Fill
        и Steep slopes mu$! be protected against erosion.
        и Bare rock on fiH embankments must be stabilized and not top soiled.
        и Care must be taken to ensure that large boulders (spoil material) do not roll
          down hill and demolish houses or crops or endanger peopte.
        и Spail that tumble down Into cultivated fields must be remOVed. Where removal
          is not feasible, the field owners must be compensated by suitable means.

10.3.3. Unstable Slopes
        и Ditches must be intercepted at the tops and bottoms of slopes and gutters and
          spillways can be used to control the flow Of water down a stope.
        и Stabilize the slope by building retaining structures such as gabions, cribs or
          other types of wooden barricades and grid WOrk, usually battered against a
          Slope.
        и Constructed retaining waUs can be built to Withstand pressures at the base of
          the slope.
        и Build reinforced earth and embankment walls, with anchors compacted Into
          the fill material-
        и Armour the sulface against erosion and abrasion by intercepting raindrops
          Oeaves).

10.4.2.   Borrow PHs
Borrow pits shall be filled with as much excess fflt material as possible but shall be kept
free of any other waste.
They shall be covered in soil stockpiled either from the original excavation of the
borrow pit or from other sources.
tr there are inadequate amounts of topsoil, then alternative f&habilltation measures
must be implemented such as:
      и Transforming quarries into lakes for recreation, aquaculture, or wildlife habitat
      и Conversion of borrow pits and spoil dump sites fnto roadside picnic areas and
         scenic lookouts.

10.4.3. Stockpiles
Once stockpiles have been removed the ground surface is to be inspected for
compaction. ShoUld it be required, the surface is then to be ripped and the re-.
vegetatfon process follows.

10.4.4. Operational Phase
Regular monitoring and maintenance of the construction areas 3hould be done by the
LC to ensure that rehabiJitation measures was successful and to observe whether
unstable cut and fitt areas need to be stabilized (eSpecially after heavy rains).
LC should make start a water quality monitoring program for the Implemented water
supply network in order to maintain the quality of water for domestic uses.

CHAPTER 11:       CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This Environmental Impact Assessment concluded that the proposed water supply and
sanitation projects in Ohamar City- under Group I urban center development program
IS environmentally viable to be implemented as far as the mitigation meaSUNS
proposed will be Implemented.

The compensation for the acquitted private properties at the proposed expansion site
of the WNTP and possibly some of the pumping stations areas should be made for
sites eJqlropriated by the Govemment for this project. The current socio-economic
aspects at the project site should be maintained and preserved through following the
proposed preventive and mitigation measures that were mentioned in Chapter seven of
this report.

The project will improve the health aspects and raising the standard of living of the
residents of Ohamar. The project will provide the residents with clean and drinkable
water according to the required standards in Yemen. In addition to that it will relief the
residents from the daily suffering via requesting the water from far distances and utilize
their time in a more fruitful activities. Public awareness campaigns should accompany
the implementation of the project and should target the residents at the impacted
areas.

The provision of the wastewater collection system and expansion of the existing
WWTP will improve the standards of Ufe and reduce the risk of contaminating the water
sources. The provision of the WWTP will ensure the reuse possibilities of treated
wastewater for the restricted Irrigation. The farmers should be controlled and their
irrigation activities should be watched by the Ministry of Agriculture and the local
Government.

The untreated wastewater during the expanSion of the existing WWTP should be
avoided and diverted to prohibit the reuse of this water by the farmers.

The Contractor should minimize the interference and interruption of the current
services to the citizens during the construction period. Re-instatement should be
provided for all the services after the completion of the work as it were before.

The local corporation of water and sanHation in Oharnar should work closely. through
the ECO with the Contractor and Engineer to guarantee the consideration of the EMP
as requested in this report. That shOUld be done during and after the construction of the
project. Concerned parties such as National Environmental Protection Agency and the
local Government need to be involved in the process from the beginning.

It is recommended that a site management plan should be agreed during the
Contractor's mobilization.

It is necessary that most of the mitigation measures will be implemented at local level
in order to ensure the sustainability of the projects particularly during the construction
and operation of the water supply system with an effective participation of local
community. The Client, in cooperation with NGOs should ensure that local communities
are involved in the progress of Implementing the project and ensure proper usage of
the new infrastructure.

It is also Important to undertake monitoring programme in terms     of water quality and
implementation of the proposed environmental ptan so that the       proPOSed mitigation
measures are implemented. The monitoring should also foresee        other environmental
impacts that are probable to emerge and lay down strategies         to overcome these
impacts.

Proper Implementation of the EMP requires better cooperation and coom/natlon among
all the stakeholaers that will participate in the planning. implementation and monitoring
of all the proposed mitigation and preventive measures.

The Consultant introduced Annex no. 4 of this report which entaits the environmental
management plan and the Implementation proeedures as a stand alone document.

This Annex can be provided to the Contractor as part of the tender documents to be
conSidered and implemented during the construction period.

social aspects; and obligations of the country, pertaining to project activities, under fe/evan!
international environmental treaties and agreements. The Bank does not ftnance project activities
that would contravene such country obligations. as identified during the EA. EA is initialed as early
as possible in project processing and is integrated closely with the economic, fmancial, institutional,
social, and technical nnalyses of a proposed project.

                                                                                         S
и1 The borro\\-er is respon;)ible   ror carrying otlllhc EA, For Category A projects. the borrower
retains indept;:ndent EA experts not affiliated with the project to carry out the EA.~ For Category A
projects that are highly risky or contentious or that involve serious and multidimensional
cnvironmental concerns, the borrower should normally also engage an advisory panel 1.,1f
independent, internationnlly recognized environmental specialists to advise 011 all ilspeds of the
project relevant to the EA,7 The role of the advisory panel depends on the degree 1O which project
prt!parution has progressed. and on the extcnt and quality of any EA work completed. at [he time (h..:
Bank begins to consider the project.

5, 'fhe Bank advises the borrower on the Bank's EA requirements. The Bank re,jews the findings
nod recommendations of the EA to determine whether they provide an adeqLUte basis for processing
th..: project for Bank tinancing, When the borrower has completed or partially compll!lcd EA work

 g, The Bank undertakcs environmental screening of each proposed project to detcnninc the
 approprinte extent and type of EA. The Bank classi tics the proposed project into one of four
 categories. dcp<!nding on the type, location, sensitivity, nnd scale of the project and the nature and
 rl1a;i,nitudc of its potential cnvironmc:ntal impatts,

              (a) O.u(.'gory...4: A propo.scd project is classified as Category A if it is likely to   hil\l~

             unprecedented. These impacts may arrect an area broader than the sites or tudliries
             subject to physical works. EA for a Category A project examines the project's potential
             negative and positive environmental impacts, compares them with those of feasible
             alternatives (including the "without project" situation), and recommends any measures
             needed to pre,cnt, minimize, mitigate, or compensate for adverse impacts and improve
             environmental performance, For n Category A project, the borrower is responsible for
             preparing a report. normally an CIA (or a suitably comprehensiyc regional or scctoral
             EA) that includcs, as necessary, elements of the other instnlments referred to in para. 7.

             (b) Oucgory B: A proposed project is classified as Category B ifits pOtential adverse
             environmental impacts on human populations or environmentally important areas-
             including wetlands, forests, grasslands, and other natural habitats--"arc less adverse than
             those of Category A projects. These impacts arc site-specitic; few if any of them are

systematic approach to organizing and analyzing scientific infonnation about potentially hazardous

requires risk assessment for projects involving handling, storage, or disposal of hazardous materials
and waste, the construction of dams, or major construction works in locations vulnerable to seismic

and institutional measures to be taken during implementation and operation to diminate advt:rse
environmental ;:md social imp<lc!.s, offset rbem, or reduce them rc acceptable levels. The plan also
includes the actions needed to implement these measures! Management pians Urc cssential elements
(If EA repons for Category A projects; for many Category B projects, the EA may result in a
I)):magcmcnl plan only. To prepare a management plan, the borrower and its EA design team (a)
identify {he set of respons~s to potentially adverse impacts: (b) determine resuirements for ensuring
that those responses are mude effectively and in a limdy manner; and lC) describe the means for
