for Yemen were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was high, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and borrower performance was also\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            achieving full cost recovery is a very common objective in\n            Bank funded projects but which is rarely achieved in\n            practice and the present project does not make any\n            difference to that rule. One of the main reasons is that\n            cost recovery highly depend on tariff policy on which bank\n            funded activities have little leverage (except through\n            conditionality's which are rarely enforced). A better\n            objective (and more realistic) could be worded as \"to\n            put in place tariff setting and regulation mechanisms that\n            can allow a full cost recovery of the service\". This\n            Project shows that infrastructure financing is not\n            sufficient to improve service delivery. In weak capacity\n            countries like Yemen, sufficient resources should be\n            allocated for institutional development, capacity building\n            and governance improvement. In addition, the content of the\n            assistance to be provided should be defined as soon as\n            project's preparation (if possible in the form of Terms\n            of Reference) to avoid later resource diversion. The design\n            of a UFW reduction program is a complex process which needs\n            to begin by important preparatory work (update of network\n            maps and customer databases) and tests for loss assessment\n            and locating the defects (leak detection). Commercial losses\n            should also be investigated ~carefully as they may be\n            significant before investing heavily in network\n            replacements. In situations of serious water scarcity,\n            rehabilitation of networks - through replacement of pipes\n            and installation of water meters - is likely to have limited\n            effects as less water is flowing through the pipes. The\n            decline in the water consumption per connection means that\n            increased metering results in less revenues for the\n            utilities, and hence it is likely that the costs of the\n            investments are not covered by the benefits. Expanding\n            networks while the water produced is declining, results in\n            under-used infrastructure, and hence provides only partial\n            benefits. All urban water projects should be closely\n            coordinated with Urban Planning authorities to minimize the\n            risk of project's modification during implementation."}, "docdt": "2011-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
