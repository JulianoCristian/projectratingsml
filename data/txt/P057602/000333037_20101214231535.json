The project will provide efficient and\n            sustainable water and sanitation services in Yemen's\n            urban areas through: a) increase in urban water supplies\n            initially through improved operation and reduction of water\n            losses (phase one), and subsequently, through development of\n            new water resources including the reuse of wastewater (phase\n            two); b) improvement of sector management through\n            establishment of financially viable regional corporations\n            with significant participation of the private sector; and c)\n            provision of affordable sewerage facilities that assure\n            protection of the environment and permit the reuse of\n            wastewater for agriculture or artificial recharge.
