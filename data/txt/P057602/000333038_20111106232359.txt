   To provide efficient and sustainable water and sanitation services in Yemen's urban areas
   through:
   A. Increase in urban water supplies initially through improved operation and reduction of
   water losses (Phase I), and subsequently, through development of new water resources
   including the reuse of wastewater (Phase II).
   B. Improvement of sector management through establishment of financially viable
   regional corporations with significant participation of the private sector.
   C. Provision of affordable sewerage facilities that assure protection of the environment
   and permit the reuse of wastewater for agriculture or artificial recharge .

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The urban water and wastewater sector in Yemen faced major challenges at the time the project was
designed. Upland regions suffered (and continue to suffer) from increasing water shortages. Groundwater
was and still is being depleted at a nipid rate, and the exploration and exploitation of new resources is
plagued by complicated hydrogeology, entrenched traditional and tribally based water rights, and the
expense of developing limited alternatives.

The sector was not yet on a sound financial footing. However, the government had shown a willingness
to raise tariffs, having done so in 1995, 1998, 1999 and 2001. Further increases were incorporated on
January 1, 2002. Over this period, the monthly bill increased over 350% for a domestic customer
consuming 15m3/month, and the industrial tariff increased over 150 percent per m3• In many cities the
tariff level was considered sufficient but, because of poor management, cash receipts were still below that
needed to cover expenses and new investments.

The National Water and Sanitation Authority (NWSA) and its branches suffered from inadequate
managerial and technical capacity. As a result of external factors outside of its control, salary levels for
NWSA employees have been at very low levels (on a purchasing power basis) for several years, and only
a limited number of highly trained and qualified people remained in the organization. This has led to a
steady deterioration in NWSA's performance, documented by several key indicators for the major
branches, including: unaccounted for water normally around 50 percent; the number of staff per 1,000
connections typically over 10; water service coverage ratios of 50 percent or less; sewerage coverage
levels of around 20 percent; and accounts receivable that were often more than six months of sales.

The GOY was fully aware of these problems and, in 1997, formulated an Urban Water Sector Strategy
that laid out a detailed plan for addressing the formidable challenges ahead. The Strategy emphasized a
decentralized approach for resolving the managerial and financial issues for the municipal sector and
establishment of a separate entity, the National Water Resources Authority (NWRA), to work on the
problem of water resources. Specifically, the Government of Yemen (GOY) envisaged corporatization of
the sector through the establishment of autonomous local water and wastewater corporations that are
wholly state-owned, but that act independently on a day-to-day basis under formal regulatory control.
These local corporations (LCs) were expected to be financially self-sufficient, based on revenues
collected from customers and long-term borrowing for capital investments and may have private sector
management. Debt service and a portion of capital investments were expected to be paid from revenues.
The Strategy called for the establishment of the LCs between the years 2001 and 2007, and the first of
these, for the Sana'a region, was established in February 2000 as part of the Sana'a Water Supply and
Sanitation Project. In addition, the Sana'a Corporation was expected to have a private sector operator
starting in early 2003. Six other autonomous corporations were established in 2001, including for Taiz,
AI-Hodeidah and AI-Mukalla.

As more local water and sanitation corporations were established, the government and IDA envisaged a
new role for NWSA. NWSA was to concentrate on providing technical assistance, management of
NWSA branches, establishment of sector standards, organizing and implementing training programs,
establishment of a data. base for all LCs and branches, and until the establishment of a Regulator, monitor
performance. In this context, a comprehensive and IDA-financed study of NWSA's future role was
completed in 2002. Overall, IDA fully supported this strategy and, observing that it was already being
implemented by NWSA, saw little risk to the sector in this approach. NWRA was charged with
identifYing and developing sustainable water resources to meet the overall country needs including the
needs of the urban areas. NWRA was the recipient of increasing' attention inside the government,
receiving increased budget allocations and more support from donors. It established several branch offices
and completed major hydrological studies for the country's most water-stressed areas.

Within this overall strategy, and starting with the Sana'a Water Supply & Sanitation Project (Cr. 3209),
IDA explored several strategic choices. One choice was not to invest in the sector at all and await the
eventual creation of the local corporations, improvements in management and an amelioration of the
sector's overall financial condition. The second alternative was to support the GOY's time schedule for
sector reform (a ten-year program that was to finish in 2007) and to place an emphasis on technical
assistance and the financing of emergency civil works. A third alternative was to· recognize that Yemen
needs a series of orban water sector projects to address financial and coverage issues. and to complement
IDA supported projects to enhance water resources availability and mariagement. Under this option, IDA
would stay engaged in the sector, while at the same time strongly advocating for strengthened
management ability, financial performance and the degree of private sector participation.

Under ~he Sana'a Water Supply & Sanitation Project.{Cr. 3209-YEM, FY 99), IDA adopted the'third
alternative, initially making a small US$25 million investment to test the GOY's commitment to the
reform agenda. Given encouraging signs that the GOY was moving ahead with sector reform, the Urban
Water Supply & Sanitation Project (APL) followed the same strategy i.e. supporting the GOY's sector
policy jUld placing an emphasis on improving its financial viability, autonomy, and the creation of
opportunities for increased private sector participation.

For many years, the government was unable to bring most ofthecCluntry's water and sanitation utilities to
an acceptable level of performance. For this reason, and starting in the late 1990's, the GOY began to
investigate the ·possibility of increasing private sector participation (PSP) in order to improve service
levels and expand coverage. After careful study· in the summer of 2000 of alternative methods to increase
PSP,the GOY preferred a lease arrangement for private sector management of water and sewerage
services in Sana'a and would consider subsequent additional leases or other modes of PSP in its large
cities. Management contracts were considered to be too short (4-5 years) and too expensive given the low
level of revenues (about US$5 million per year in FY01 for the largest center; Sana'a), and the GOY's
inability to guarantee bulk water over the long term in many cities makes concessions unattractive for
private operators. Thus, a self-financing long-term lease (of at least 10 years) with an experienced private
operator was the most attractive PSP option, and it was to set the stage for awarding concessions once the
issue of long-term supply of bulk water was successfully addressed. In some cities, where there' was
exceptional management, the utility operated on a commercial basis and had achieved financial self-
sustainability, the government was not expected to adopt a large PSP' intervention. In these instances, the
appropriate level of private sector involvement was to be determined locally on a case-by-case basis.

IDA and the GOY preferred an Adaptable Program Lending (APL) approach for the sector, rather than
addressing investment needs city-by-city and project-by'"project. It was felt that the sector's policy issues
were basically identical in all the country's urban areas and the model for addressing them was established
with the Sana'a Water Supply & Sanitation Project. The objective was then to expand the agreed approach
starting with the major urban areas. Thus a vertical APL, with triggers designed to deepen the sector's
financial, regulatory and management policies and, practices, was the logical choice for IDA's next
intervention. In order to accommodate the speed with which the government and different urban utilities
can implement the envisaged policy measures, the APL was designed in two Phases. Phase I eligibility
criteria concentrated on achieving a minimum level of operational autonomy and financial stability, while
moving to Phase II required that a sector regulator be in place, further financial strengthening and
                                                                                .                         /

enhanced private sector management of the sector's assets. Overall, an APL Program estimated at US$250
million was envisioned, over a period of about eight years for both phases.



                                                     2
IDA and the GOY agreed that the important triggers for processing the APL would be the establishment
of the Sana'a Local Water Supply and Sanitation Corporation and the launching of tendering for a private
sector lease contract for operation of the Sana'a water and wastewater systems. In line with this objective,
the Presidential Decree No. 53 for establishment of the Sana'a Local Corporation was issued on March 9,
2000 and tender documents for a private operator were prepared. The Request for Proposals from pre-
qualified operators was expected to be issued in early August 2002. These achievements were ahead of
the targets set under the Sana'a Water Supply and Sanitation Project (Cr. 3209-YE) and provided good
indications of GOY commitment to the sector reform agenda.

Criteria for urban centers to participate in Phase 1 of the APL included the following:
        Completion of an environmental assessment acceptable to IDA;
        The existence of a billing and collection system acceptable to IDA;
        Full coverage of O&M expenses on a cash basis;
        An autonomous regional/local corporation is in place with clear criteria for tariff setting; and
        The existence of an investment program that has been endorsed by the Ministry of Planning.
At the outset of the project, four cities met the Phase 1 criteria: Sana'a, Hodeidah, Taiz, and Mukallah.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The overall APL objective as stated in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) was to assist the Republic
of Yemen in providing efficient and sustainable water and sanitation services in its major urban areas by:
i) increasing urban water supplies, initially through improved operation and reduction of water losses
(Phase I) and subsequently through development of new water resources including the reuse of
wastewater (Phase II); (ii) improving sector management through establishment of financially viable
regional corporations with significant participation of the private sector; and (iii) provision of affordable
sewerage facilities that assure protection of the environment and permit the reuse of wastewater for
agricultural or artificial recharge. The end-of-project indicator for Phase 1 as stated in the Project Design
Summary was "a deepening and broadening of GOY's commitment to sector reform and sustainability.

There were four expected outcomes for Phase I. First, there was to be a significant increase in the
availability of water and sewerage services in the project cities. Next, a sector regulator was to be
established. Third, it was expected that there would be significant Private Sector participation in the
management of Sana'a facilities. Finally, the Phase I project cities were to have achieved financial
viability and accountability, improved implementation capacity and be eligible for on-lending
arrangements in Phase n.

Triggers for going ahead with Phase II were defined as follows:
•   The regulator is in place and functional;
•   The performance indicators for Phase I efficiency improvements have been met, including wastewater
    coverage;
•   Tendering Private Sector Participation (PSP) contract for at least two additional local corporations;
•   Achieving a level of disbursements equal to 40 percent of Phase I;
•   For each urban center seeking investment under Phase II:
        Completion of an environmental assessment acceptable to IDA;
        The existence of a billing and collection system acceptable to IDA;




                                                     3
        Cash 'coverage of water related debt service plus self-generation of 5% of the three-year average
        water investment program;
        An autonomous regionill/local corporation is in place with clear criteria for tariff setting; and
        The existence of an investment program that has been endorsed by the Ministry of Planning.

The achievement of the PDQ for the first Phase was to be monitored through the following indicators (see
targets in the Data Sheet):                                      .

Outcome/lmpact Indicators: 1) Twenty percent increase in the availability of urban water and sewerage
services from current coverage; 2) Establishment of local water and sanitation corporations in AI-Hodeida,
AI-Mukalla and Taiz; 3) Significant Private Sector Participation in the management of Sana'a water and
sewerage services and tendering for PSP contracts in at least two other project cities; 4) Achievement of
financial viability in the project cities; and 5) Achieving an equitable balance between improving water
and wastewater services and expanding coverage.

Output Indicators: 1) Unaccounted for Water (UFW) not greater than 35% in the project cities; 2) 50
percent increase in the frequency of water availability from the public system for all customers; 3) 60,000
new and rehabilitated water and sewer connections; and 4) Collected revenues cover at least operation
and maintenance (Q&M) costs, debt service and 5% ofthe next year's water investment program.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key IndicatorS, and
reasons/justification

No change was made to the PDQ or key associated outcome targets during the course of the Project.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The primary target group was the urban residents of Sana'a, Taiz, Al-Mukalla and Al-Hodeidah and any
additional urban centers that would meet the qualification criteria defined for APL I. In addition, the
residents of up to six small urban centers with critical needs but not fully meeting the conditions for Phase,
1 were expected to benefit. Priority on investments was given to areas: (i) with serious environmental
concerns; (ii) without adequate services; and (iii) that were densely populated and characterized by low-
cost housing.                                                          '

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The project as originally planned in the PAD included three components.

Component 1. Rehabilitation, and Improvement of Water and Wastewater Facilities (USS122 million)
as designed to finance the infrastructure works and equipment required to improve the water and
sanitation services in the Project cities~ It included: .
•   Civil works, goods and equipment for the rehabilitation and expansion of the water supply networks
    and related facilities (pumping stations, reservoirs);
•   The rehabilitation and drilling of new boreholes;
•   The rehabilitation and expansion of wastewater networks, treatment plants and related facilities.
•   Basic water supply and, wastewater treatment works for six small urban centers with undeveloped
    networks that could not qualify to participate in Phase 1 of the APL.



                                                     4
Component 2. Institutional Support (US$16 million) was designed to provide technical assistance,
training and equipment to support the implementation of the project, build the local corporations' capacity
and prepare the second Phase of the Program. The assistance was to include training and workshops for
local corporations, NWSA, and Ministry staff, local and international advisors for institutional
development, and capacity building to establish a regulatory body for the water and wastewater sector.

To address the need for comprehensive investment planning for the wastewater collection, treatment,
sludge disposal and wastewater re-use, this component also included:
•   A stand alone Sector Environmental Assessment (SEA) for the Sana'a Capital Trust area that would
    result in: (i) a government policy on the wastewater issue; and (ii) a wastewater investment plan for
    the short, medium and long terms.
•    A feasibility study for new wastewater treatment capacity in the Sana'a Trust area.

Component 3. Maintenance Works in Sana'a (US$10 million) was designed to finance maintenance
related works, equipment and services for th.e existing water and w,astewater facilities in the city of Sana'a.

1.6 Revised Components

There has been no modification of the components during the implementation period of the Project.

1.7 Other significant changes

The signing of a Lease Contract for Sana'a was a disbursement condition for Components 1 and 3 in the
capital city. Three international companies were short-listed and participated in a Pre-Bid meeting in
October 2002. However, none of them submitted a bid on January 14,2003, citing unfavorable security
conditions. Upon GOY's request and commitment to move from a lease to a management contract, the
Bank then agreed (June 2003) to unblock the funds allocated for civil works in Sana'a (US$16 million),
but continued to block the funds allocated to Component 3.

The programmatic approach chosen which kept flexibility in the allocation of resources resulted in some
adjustments as shown in Annex 1.

The feasibility study for new wastewater treatment capacity in the Sana'a Trust area (part of Component
2) was funded by a grant from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA).

The Closing Date (initially December 31, 2007) was extended twice to accommodate implementation
delays. A first extension until December 15, 2009 was granted on December 17, 2007 to complete the on-
going works in some of the project cities and also to allow an opportunity to usefully allocate the excess
funds (resulting from the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) appreciation) to new sub-projects and other
activities. A second extension until December 31, 2010 was granted on August 20, 2009 in order to
complete all contractual commitments under the project.

Finally, the Bank cancelled funds in the amount of 3,253,740 SDR for Consultant Services in February
2006 as a consequence of a misprocurement case, and 16,273,499 SDR of uncommitted funds on
December 8, 2010 as indicated in Annex 1.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The Project design built on the Sana'a Water Supply and Sanitation Project (SWSSP, Cr. 3209-YE, 1999-
2003) which ~nded the preparation studies for the new project. Feasibility studies for Sana'a were
completed early and were available for the project appraisal. Those for Hodeidah and Taiz were
completed in May 2003 and October 2003 respectively. The Mukalla feasibility study was completed in
A~WM.                                                                                           '

A study on privatization options was also carried out within the SWSSP and, as a result, the government
decided to accelerate the decentralization program and prepare the sector for the introduction of private
sector participation in the provision of water supply and sanitation services in Sana'a through a lease
contract. A legal expert firm was hired to help the GOY draft the transaction documents for this operation.

A PAD Review was organized on November 7,2001 well before appraisal which decided inter-alia that:
(i) the condition of Board presentation for the Project would be the opening of the technical bid envelope
from pre-qualified bidders for the lease contract in Sana'a; (ii) the Regulator should be in place and
functioning by the end of APL I. The meeting also decided that, as the Project was only the second APL
in MENA to go to the Board, it should be presented to the Operations Committee. In view of the delays of
the Lease Contract tendering process, the condition of Board presentation was lifted during negotiations
and replaced by the issuance of the Request for Proposal.

A virtual Operations Committee (OC) review took place, then, during December 2001which asked to
include a' disbursement condition 'for the city of Sana'a that requires a signed lease contract before civil
works are tendered. In the same time, the OC asked to make it clear that private sector provision of water
would not be sought as an end in itself, but rather be seen, in some cases, as an effective means to achieve
the primary objectives of enhanced access, quality/reliability, and efficiency.

Also, the initial idea to implement the Project with the existing SWSSP's PMU was dropped during
negotiations as GOY asked the PMU's salaries to be paid by IDA Credit, which required recruiting the
staff competitively.                                                .

2.2 Implementation
(a) Factors outside the control of government or implementing agencies:
The poor security conditions in the Country have caused major disruptions to project implementation. It
discouraged private operators from submitting bids for Sana'a Lease Contract and delayed consultants'
visits and Bank's supervision missions.'
(b) Factors subject to government control:
The decision to hire new staff for the Project Management Unit (PMU), including the Project Director,
contributed to delays at the beginning of the Project. The Project Director was hired on April 26, 2003
and the Procurement Specialist in June 2004 only. In the meantime, the PMU in place at that time for
SWSSP had little incentive and was understaffed to deal with a Procurement Plan that included more than
50 packages. As a result, although at the time of appraisal the Bank had granted its No Objection (NO) to
most of the Prequalification Documents of Contractors and reviewed draft versions of some Tender
Documents, first Prequalification Evaluation reports and Tender Documents were received only one year
later.                                                                         .




                                                    6.
In Mukalla, land acquisition problems and the. issuance of a new urban Development Plan required the
relocation of the Wastewater Treatment Plant a few weeks after Contract award. This resulted in
extensive delays, a need for new de~igns, and conflicts with the contractors, which could have been
avoided with better coordination and planning.
(c) Factors subject to implementing agencies control:
Execution of procurement processes by the implementing agency was very slow and inefficient, and
affected by significant shortcomings (see section 2.4). This was exacerbated by the delay in recruitment
of new staff within the PMU (see above), but was a factor throughout the life of the project.

As mentioned in Section 1.7, one case of misprocurement resulted in a partial cancellation of the IDA
credit.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
(a) M&E Design
The M&E framework included five outcome indicators as described in Section 1.3. Of these, the
establishment of local water and sanitation corporations in Sana'a, AI-Hodeida, AI-Mukalla and Taiz)
was irrelevant as it was already met at the time of appraisal. One indicator (achievement of an equitable
balance between improving water and wastewater services and expanding coverage) was not adequately
defined to function as a measurable indicator.

The design also included four output indicators. The number of connections was adequate to monitor the
infrastructure component of the Project. An indicator to monitor the works related to wastewater
treatment would also have been useful, such as the percentage of wastewater treated or the quantity of
Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) removed.

The UFW indicator and the financial ratio are standard indicators useful to enrich the policy dialogue and
progress towards achieving financial viability.

(b) M&E Implementation
Although anticipated in the PAD, no baseline survey was carried out to establish the situation of the
targeted beneficiaries and the status of monitoring indicators at the outset of the project. Several of the
indicators therefore could not be used as a basis for monitoring project achievements.

Three indicators were consistently reported through progress reports and supervision missions: the UFW
ratio, the number of additional connections provided, and the revenue/expense ratio.

Faced with the difficulty to collect accurate population data and the lack of a baseline, the 20% increase
in "service -availability" indicator was replaced by the volume of water provided by connection (in
M3/connection/day).                                     .         .

The Performance Indicators Information System (PHS) put in place by the Ministry of Water and
Environment (MWE) in 2006 with the support of the Techoicai Secretariat and GIZ which is monitoring
17 performance indicators for each utility, including two of those mentioned above, could have been very
useful for monitoring the project but the value ofthis tool was jeopardized by the very late publication of
the data (more than two years between data collection and publication). At the time of the ICR
preparation, data were available for 2006 and 2007 only.




                                                    7
(c) M&E utilization
Indicators were mainly used to determine the degree to which triggers for going ahead with Phas~ II were
met.
However, further initiatives are noteworthy for the sector and for measuring project impacts:
• The PIIS developed within the MWE (see above).
• The Performance Agreement for the Sana'a LC signed on January 17,2010 by the Mayor of Sana'a
  which defines a set of performance objectives and indicators.
• The M&E framework put in place within the National Water Sector Strategy and Investment Program
  (NWSSJP) update which uses some of the project's indicators.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environmental Assessment (OPIBP 4.01): The Project was rated as Category B, on the basis that it
would mainly rehabilitate existing facilities. This was justified for Sanaa and Taiz, but not appropriate for
Mukalla, which included a ne\\, wastewater treatment plant.

pnvironmental Mitigation Plans approved by IDA were developed for each of the sub-projects within the
Project. An Environmental Safety Officer (ESO) was hired by the PMU but resigned in July 2005. The
gap was filled by an expert mobilized by the Consultant contracted to provide technical assistance to the
PMU for project management.

The audit carried out by this expert upon Bank's request in October 2008 reported that the civii works
contractors didn't always have the experience and capacity to actually implement the environmental
mitigation measures specified in their contracts. This was the case, in particular, in AI-Qaida (contract
was terminated) and Taiz. The main deficiencies noted concern: (i) the safety precautions that are
generally very weak; and (ii) the irregular collection of debris and waste which raised complaints from
residents in some areas.

Lastly, the Malaria Abatement Program recommended in Taiz by the Environmental Impact Assessment
(EIA) to mitigate the likely breeding of anopheles mosquitoes in the sewage lagoons was not
implemented as the public health and malaria specialist foreseen to help the ESO was never hired.

Involuntary Resettlement (OPIBP 4.12): The Project included some limited unoccupied land acquisition
in Mukallah and Taiz, which didn't require resettlement. Provisions of the Land Acquisition and
Resettlement Policy Framework prepared for the Project were respected. However, although the· Bank
requested the PMU to publish the Arabic version of this document in December 2008, it was made
available only toward the end of the Project (March 2010).

In Mukalla, project implementation was delayed by land acquisition issues that had to do with tribal
access rights to Government lands. The courts ultimately resolved the case in Government's favor.

In Taiz, Ii prior environmental and social issue had severe impacts during the project life. The community
within which the Taiz waste stabilization ponds were built before the project began claimed that they
were not provided with the compensation (electricity and piped water connections) promised by the local
government. As a result, new sewer lines built by the project were broken, untreated waste is being used
for irrigating food crops, and the ponds that. were rehabilitated by the project have been "reclaimed" by
the local sheikh for grazing livestock. Bank supervision missions repeatedly noted this problem and
required mitigating actions. A protracted negotiation with the community began in the final years of the


                                                     8
 project but the problem was unresolved at the time of project completion and raw sewage continued to be
 used for food crop irrigation.

Financial Management (OPIBP 10.02) and Disbursement (OPIBP 12.00): The Project benefitted from
the previous IDA Sana'a Water and Sanitation Project (Cr. 3209-YE) and the PMU had in place adequate
staff and a sound and developed fmancial management system at the start of the Project. The Project used
both Statement of Expenses (SOE) and direct payment disbursement methods and the flow of funds ran
smoothly between the Bank and the Project. Timely submission of audit reports was an issue for some
Local Corporations at the beginning of the Project. This was gradually corrected.

Procurement (OPIBP 11.00): Overall, procurement activities were acceptable but with' substantial
deficiencies. One case ofmisprocurement r:esulted in a partial cancellation of funds (SDR 3,252,740).

 In most of the civil works contracts, a completion period of 18 months was systematically specified
 although the actual estimated completion period was well beyond that date with intent to avoid the "Price
 adjustment provisions" specified in the Bank's Procurement Guidelines. This seems to be a generic issue
 in Yemen since the Government does not publish indexes for construction costs.

Minimum Qualifications of bidders for Works contracts did not alwa.ys comply with Bank's guidelines
(turnover should exceed 2 times the annual cash flow for the contract). For instance, the Tender for
drilling 10 boreholes in Sana'a required the bidders to have a minimum turnover ofUS$2 million, while
it should have been at least US$6.7 million (the contract cost was estimated to US$5 million to be
implemented in 18 months). Also, in Mukalla, the same Joint Venture was awarded two contracts while
the Prequalification Report stated· that the average annual turnover of the local joint-venture partner
qualified the N for one contract only. It appeared afterwards, that this local company was also the civil
works subcontractor for Mukallah WWTP and was also selected for two contracts in Hodeidah. Clellfly.
the volume of work given to this N was far above what they were able to handle within a so short period
of time, and this was reflected in poor contract performance.

2.S Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(a) Transition and post-completion arrangements
The Qperation and maintenance of the infrastructure financed by the project is the responsibility of the
concerned Local Water Supply and Sanitation Corporations or NWSA branches. As these entities were
also closely involved in the construction supervision and the works commissioning, the transition
between the construction phase and the operation phase ran very smoothly. However, some progress is
still required on the resource allocation and financial sustainability fronts to ensure that service provision
is in accordance with the facilities constructed.

The on-going Water Sector Support Project (WSSP) designed within a Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp)
built on the experience of the on-going Bank and other donor projects and programs, as well as country
programs, to fill the financing gap within NWSSIP. The WSSP is intended to accommodate investments
initially planned for APL 2 and includes components that will continue the project's capacity and
performance enhancement activities for local corporations.
(b) Performance indicators
The Performance Indicator Information System (PIIS) established within the MWE covers a large
proportion of the urban utilities in Yemen, including those supported by the project. It allows for a
meaningful analysis of the performance of the urban water sub-sector and creates a good basis to develop
accountability and transparency.      .



                                                     9
 In addition, the monitoring framework for the water sector developed within NWSSIP and followed by
 the WSSP will give useful information on overall sector performance, including the activities initiated
 under the UWSSP.
 (c) Recommendations for follow-up
 The Bank is a key donor for the recently-launched WSSP and will continue to be engaged in the urban
 water sector. Investments planned under APL 2 were transferred to WSSP when this new approach was
 decided. Close attention should be paid through the supervision of WSSP towards actions required to
 continue improving the performance of utilities such as: (i) capacity building; (ii) development of the
 institutional framework for increased autonomy and accountability; and (iii) better demand management
 through metering and adequate tariffs.

 In addition, the funding gap for achieving NWSSIP objectives is still significant and follow-on projects
 especially to support the urban water sector would be appropriate.

 3. Assessment of Outcomes

 3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
 The project's objectives were and are still highly relevant. As confirmed by the recently updated
 (December 2008) NWSSIP, the GOY's goal is still to "increase urb~n water supply and sanitation
 coverage while keeping services affordable to the poor, safe, sustainable and properly regulated".

 The utility decentralization program is moving forward and has to be completed by 2015, coupled with
 strengthened autonomy of the utilities on a business basis. The need to involve the private sector in both
 service provision and outsourcing of functions has also been reaffirmed in NWSSIP update and WSSP.

 However, the current Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) has reduced its support to the urban water
 subsector. For the period 2010-2013, the Bank group will direct its assistance towards (i) increasing
 annual water savings through improved water efficiency (mainly in irrigation) and (ii) extending rural
 access to water supply and sanitation services.

 3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

 Although, the Project only partially achieved its overall PDO (see details on indicators in Appendix 2), it
 produced significant outcomes.                                              .     .

 In Sana'a the production capacity increased at the beginning of the project as a result of prior SWSSP
 investments and decreased then due to the delay in drilling new wells. The production capacity expected
 should be reached by the end of 2011, once the wells are commissioned. The reliability of the water
 service was also increased in the oldest sectors of the city where the project worked.

 InTaiz, Hodeidah and Mukalla, sewerage networks were expanded to cover new areas .

. Despite the failure of the attempt to involve the private sector in the management of water and sewerage
  services due to the security situation that discouraged the prequalified operators to submit a bid, some
  progress was made towards achieving financial viability in the project cities, but this is still fragile as
  there is a strong political resistance to further adjust the tariffs (see Annex 3).
 One ofthe·smaller cities (Dhamar) was able to meet the criteria to get funds under the project.




                                                     10
 3.3 Efficiency

 Replicating the economic analysis was fraught with. difficulties including: (i) the lack of clarity aboutthe
 economic analysis as described in the PAD; (ii) the decline in the supply of water during project
 implementation; (iii) the implementation of investments funded by other donofs in supplement to Bank
 funded investments; (iv) the incomplete information on actual benefits; and (v) the impossibility to collect
 further data due to the security situation in the country. TheICR Team therefore made a qualitative'
 assessment based on unit costs as detailed in Annex 3, which identified that the expected economic
 returns from the investments funded by the Bank were affected by the depletion of the groundwater,
 which is the primary source of water in all of the project cities.

 On the financial side, despite some improvements, most notably the increase in access to water and
 wastewater services, the performance of the utilities is still unsustainable, whether in the short-, medium-
 or long-term. Although it is important that customers get access to services, the current model of service
 provision is not financially sustainable. In general, the utilities do not generate enough revenues to cover
 their basic operation and maintenance costs, and are also not able to cover their cash expenses with the
 cash collections.

  The lack of revenues is partially linked to low tariffs. Apart from Sana'a,· real tariffs have hardly
  increased since 2001. At the same time, alternatives to piped water - including water from vendors - sell
  for $1.40 to $3 per cubic meter. Yet, the small revenue basis of the utilities is also linked to very low
  consumption levels. Household surveys suggest that the number of people per connection is very high,
. and hence the average per capita water consumption is in some towns not more than 30 liters per capita .
  per day. Obviously, this consumption is critical for people's livelihood.

 3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

 Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

 The pefformance of the utilities is still unsustainable, whether in the short-, medium- or long-term and the
 approach selected to involve the private sector proved to be inappropriate to Yemen's context. The
 regulator is not formed yet.                                                                  .

 The operation's objectives were fully achieved on the wastewater systems subcomponent but only
 partially on the water supply systems and water resource development subcomponents. After two
 extensions of the closing date, a substantial portion of the credit remained unspent and the GoY
 accordingly requested the cancellation of $25 million of the credit which was approved on 8 December,
 2010. The long-standing implementation delays and contractual disputes that affected project
 implementation in Mukallah and to a lesser extent elsewhere were not solved at project's closing.

 3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

 (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
 There were no specific poverty reduction, gender, or social development outcomes defined for the project.
 To the extent that services were improved for the project cities as a whole, low-income groups benefited
 from the project outcomes, but this was not monitored.

 (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
 The operation was a catalyst to move forward with institutional reforms. Urban service provision is now
 decentralized to commercially run local corporations in an increasing number of cities. The utilities


                                                     11
substantially increased tariffs, despite the political sensitivity of the topic in Yemen, and managed to
increase cost recovery. The Local Corporations are progressively receiving the assistance required to
improve their efficiency and level of services.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
The Project funded several preparatory studies which have allowed other donors to ~tep in and contribute
to the sector's development. In particular, the project funded two contracts for 14 small cities to develop:
water resources studies, feasibility studies, and detailed designs. This was a major effort that was meant to
prepare packages for the next phase of the APL. These studies have helped the GOY implement a second
stage of works with financing amounting to US$150 million funded by various regional funds (Arab Fund,
Saudi Fund, Abu Dhabi Fund, Islamic Development .Bank and Oman).

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
No Beneficiary Surveyor Stakeholder Workshop was carried out at the end of the Project due to political
instability and security concerns.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: High

The lack of commitment of GOY to proceed with agreed reforms is beginning to affect the commitment
of donors to the sector. Although the framework in place through NWSSIP and the newWSSP ensures
alignment of donors and GOY towards support to the sector, the sector is still very much underfinanced.
Regional development funds are progressively stepping in to fill the gap and are now the main
contributors to the urban water sector. Better coordination with those funds should. be encouraged to
harmonIze the approaches and support to the GOY.

The inability of the Government to address water usage conflicts and effectively manage water resources·
in the Mountain Region (Sana'a, Taiz) jeopardizes the sustainability of the project and prevents the
affected Local Corporations from developing their production capacity and satisfying current and
projected demand.

Finally, the capacity of the LCs and inefficient tariff policy are still a concern and affect the utility
performance.

s. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
S.l Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The APL was an appropriate fmancing instrument to accomplish the complex objectives of the program
within a wide geographical area. Built on the satisfactory implementation of the SWSSP, it was a
promising vehicle at the time the project was designed to support the progressive creation ofautonomous
regional corporations, to establish sufficient cost recovery in several major cities and to prepare the
introduction of the private sector in the management of the water and sanitation servic.es.




                                                   12
 The ambitious inclusion of private sector participation in the outcomes, was questioned d.luing Project's
 preparation by the Operations Committee on the basis that the project should rather focus on improving
 the operational efficiency of the utilities and on enhancing water and sewer services. The project could
 have given less emphasis to "~ignificant private sector participation" as a desired outcome of the project
 and instead emphasize improved management practices and strengthened managerial and technical
 capacity.

, Measuring financial sustainability by cash flows alone was a bit restrictive. Financial sustainability can be
  achieved only if sound and solid corporate governance arrangements are in place within the Local
  Corporations. The project could have benefitted from a better adjustment of the outcomes indicators to the
  actual phasing of the operation, with more time allocated for achieving financial sustainability

 Finally, Sana'a and Taiz would have deserved more emphasis towards addressing water resource scarcity.
 In Sana'a, the assumption was that the Sana'a Basin Water management Project (Cr. No. 3774-YEM)
 would help conserve water that will be available for urban uses. In Taiz, there was an understanding that
 if the leaks were controlled and ,the network redesigned to work' as sectors, then there would be a better
 service, but in the absence of adequate supplies the impact of network improvements was negligible on
 overall service quality.

 (b) Quality of Supervision
 Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

 With a total of 20 supervision missions over the life of the project, IDA spared no effort in supporting
 Project implementation, despite several travel bans due to security conditions. However, once the Lease
,Contract bidding process failed, the Bank's decision not to disburse the funds allocated to maintenance
 works in Sana'a was unfortunate as it prevented Sana'a Water Supply and, Sewerage Local Corporation
 (SWSSLC) from receiving funds aimed at improving its performanct(.

 Institutional support planned to the Local Corporations did not materialize as most of this component has
 been consumed at the central level (MWE and PMU) while very little was done to improve the situation
 at the local level.

 Some proactive actions could have been taken earlier in the project. In particular, the Mid-Term review
 carried out in February 2006 while 90% of the credit was committed but only 22% of the funds had been
 disbursed may have be too optimistic when concluding that the project was "on track" to achieve its
 objectives. The opportunity could have been taken then to carefully review and restructure the, project
 with more realistic targets.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Overall, the Bank did its best to support a very ambitious agenda within a difficult context.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Central Government, in particular the Ministry of Water and Environment and the TechnicafSecretariat,
provided crucial support to move the project forward at difficult junctures. For example, the Government



                                                      13
 kept on pushing the PPP agenda forward after the failure of the Lease Contract. The Minister also
 involved himself personally in trying to resolve deadlocks with the Contractors in Mukallah.

 (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
 Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

 Progress by the PMU was initially very slow due to inadequate staffing arrangements. Procurement
 activities did not always meet ~e standard'required on a Bank funded project (see section 2.4).

 At the local level, the PIUs set up within the Local Corporations proved to be ineffective in Taiz and
 Mukallah which resulted in significant delays.

 (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
 Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

 6. Lessons Learned

  Private Sector Participation: Attracting international operators in a new country is not an easy task and
  needs extra caution. The perception by the private sector of the security as well as the quality of the
  governance in the. country, the institutional framework reliability, the project's size aod expected benefits
  compared to the required commercial investment, the actual service condition are all factors that need to
  be carefully assessed. Dialogue with private operators associations should be encouraged in order to build
  mutual trust and address every concern as soon as the concept stage. Also, PPP operations need to be
. benchmarked within the global world market. To be attractive, an operation must pre'sent competitive
  advantages in terms of size and financial returns compared to similar operations in other parts of the
 ~~.                                                                                                        '




 If the country and/or the project are not likely.to raise-international operators' interest, domestic solutions
 should be promoted through, for instance, partial privatization of selected utilities through an increase of
 their capital.

 Cost recovery: Achieving full cost recovery is a very common objective in Bank funded projects but
 which is rarely achieved in practice and the present project does not make any difference to that rule. One
 of the main reasons is that cost recovery highly depend on tariff policy on which bank funded activities
 have little leverage (except through conditionalities which are rarely enforced). A better objective (and
 more realistic) could be worded as "to put in place tariff setting and regulation mechanisms that can allow
 a full cost recovery of the service".

Institutional development and capacity building: This Project shows that infrastructure financing is not
sufficient to improve service delivery. In weak capacity countries like Yemen, ,sufficient resources should
be allocated for institutional development, capacity building and governance improvement. In addition,
the content of the assistance to be provided should be defined as soon as project's preparation (if possible
in the form of Terms of Reference) to avoid later resource diversion.

Unaccountedfor Water reduction: The design of a UFW reduction program is a complex process which
needs to begin by important preparatory work (update of network maps and customer databases) and tests
for loss assessment and locating the defects (leak detection). Commercial losses should also be
investigated ~arefully as they may be significant before investing heavily in network replacements.




                                                      14
Design of water and sanitation infrastructures in water constrained environments: In situations of serious
water scarcity, rehabilitation of networks - through replacement of pipes and installation of water meters -
is likely to have limited effects as less water is flowing through the pipes. The decline in the water
consumption per connection means that increased metering results in less revenues for the utilities, and
hence it is likely that the co~ts of the investments are not covered by the benefits. Expanding networks
while the water produced is declining, results in under-used infrastructure, and hence provides only partial
benefits.

Yet, it also suggests that when a project is designed, alternative solutions are to be looked into. Building
a piped network system for such low consumption volumes means high investment costs, and high cost of
operation and maintenance. In the context of increasing water scarcity, and fierce competition for scarce
water resources between sub-sectors (most notably between irrigation and water supply), the question
arises whether the current business model of providing relatively high levels of piped water service to a
relatively small group of customers that require significant government subsidies and that essentially
benefit richer households is the best way to provide water supply and sanitation services. It is therefore
advisable to investigate other water resource development options such as rainwater collection. The
assessment of the most economical solution should also include an estimate of the buy-out of the wells
used for agricultural purposes as the last recourse option.

Land acquisition: All urban water projects should be closely coordinated with Urban Planning authorities
to minimize the risk of project's modification during implementation.

M&E framework: Urban water projects are very city specific and projects design is more effective if the
SUb-components and outputs are detailed for each city to take into account their specific needs and
objectives. Careful atten.tion to the consistency between the M&E framework and the Project's outputs is
also very important.

Risk Mitigation: Risks (especially high risks) need to be addressed more seriously as soon as the concept
stage. The new Operational Risk Assessment Framework designed by the Bank as part of its overall
investment lending reform is a valuable tool that should help teams to better address risk mitigation and
impact during project; s preparation.

Implementation arrangements: The current implementation arrangements proved to be SUb-optimal. The
supposedly transitory PMU is still in place and the Local Corporations still rely on it to manage their own
infrastructure investments as well as on the German-supported PCU for their technical assistance and
capacity building needs. Although the PMU has been very valuable for the coordination of Project
activities, future Bank's operations should encourage that more tasks be delegated to Local Corporations
in the implementation of Project's activities.

Effectiveness condition: The Project shows that it is necessary to ask for all implementation arrangements
to be in place before a project can be declared effective.

Prequalification criteria: This project confirms the need to respect worldwide accepted qualification
criteria for Contractors. If there is a fear that this may reduce competition, it is better to split the Contracts
into smaller packages rather than stretching the qualification criteria and awarding the Contract to a too
small enterprise.

Construction Contract Periods: "Seemingly intentionally" shortened civil works contract periods with
expectation of application of "price adjustment provision" is a systemic problem of Government
procurement. This should be avoided under WSSP and other future Bank projects in·Yemen.



                                                       15
 Definition of the project's benefits. It is important to define the benefits of the different project
 components. If the Bank funded investments are part of a larger investment plan, they should be assessed
 as part of the total investment plan and associated benefits that are funded by multiple donors.

  Cost-effectiveness criteria: Programs funded by the Bank that are not fully defined at the time ofappraisal
. should include some cost-effectiveness criteria to guide the Borrower in the definition of priority
  investments during implementation.

 Project's ratings and supervision: The project storyline has shown the difficulty for the TTLs to report on
 Project's performance in a realistic and objective manner. Efforts of TTLs to support project's
 implementation tend to put them in a ''judge and party" position. Just as the Bank advocates having
 independent auditors to monitor the projects, Projects performance ratings realism would certainly
 increase if those ratings were given by entities independent from the supervision teams.

 Support from Country Offices: Country Offices often playa critical role to enhance project's performance,
 provided this performance is properly reported.

 7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

 (a) Borrower/implementing agencies

  On the negative impact of the late change ofthe TTL, the position of the Borrower is well noted. However,
  Mr Bakalian has been TTL of the Project for more than 5 years and it is normal that after such a long
. period a time,the TTL be replaced in order to allow for Bank staff professional career evolution.

 On the project rating, the Project rating was downgraded in September 2009, not as a result of the change
 in TTLship, but as a result of a review of the Project by the Bank's regional Quality Team that estimated
 thatthe Project's rating was not realistic. This was not based on the disbursement ratio but on the non-
 achievement of the project outcomes.

 On the implementing agency performance, we agree that part of the MU outcome is due to the poor
 performance of the Local Corporations. However, we have noted that one of the objectives of the project
 was to transfer capacity to those LCs and this objective was not achieved.

 On the design oj the Lease Contract, the comments of the technical Secretariat are well noted and were
 taken into account in the lessons learnt.

                                 ANNEX .2: Outputs by Component

Component 1: Rehabilitation and Improvement of Water and Wastewater Facilities

This component aimed to improve the water and sanitation services in selected cities based on
comprehensive development plans. It was divided into four subcomponents: (i) water supply; (ii) water
resources; (iii) wastewater; and (iv) basic works for .six small urban centers. This division was unfortunate
as a monitoring of the different indicators on a consolidated basis did not allow taking into account the
specific objectives of each city, nor the real impact of the project. A division of subcomponents per city
would have been more meaningful.

Lack of studies in the six small cities selected within the last subcomponent, prevented it to achieve its
objectives and works took place in only one city out of the six (Dhamar).

The specific outputs of this component are detailed below, according to the different project cities.

Sana'a: IDA's intervention in Sana'a focused on the rehabilitation and expansion of water networks,
water related facilities (pumps, reservoirs, etc.) and drilling of new boreholes. The sanitation component
was funded by the Arab Fund under a separate project. Key Component 1 outputs in Sana'a are given
below:
•   Production: This component took a lot of time. A first contract for the drilling of 10 boreholes was
    terminated for Contractor's default, after the successful completion of one well only, which is now in
    operation. A new contract for drilling 5 deep boreholes was signed lately but, at the closing date, only
    two wells had been drilled. At the time of this ICR (April 2011), these two. wells are not yet in
    operation and still need to be connected to Al-Sabaeen reservoir. Due to these delays, the water
    production is Sana'a has been decreasing since 2006 as a result of the water table depletion and the
    shutdown of several wells that have collapsed or were in need of major rehabilitation works. A 5,000
    m 3 ground storage tank was built.
•   Distribution: By the closing date, 47 km of secondary water pipes and 161 km of tertiary mains were
    installed to renew and extend the network in the Low Level Distribution Zone, including 12,547 new
    connections. In addition, 20,000 water meters and valves were procured making 7,500 available to
    SWSLC for future needs. However, despite the additional 12,500 households being connected, the
    coverage ratio has decreased as a result of the extremely high growth of the city
•   Unaccounted for water: At the time of preparation, the overall UFW was estimated to be about 50
    percent for NWSA as a whole. But it appeared further that SWSLC UFW stood at 36 percent by the
    end of 2002. The network rehabilitation seems to have had an impact in the reduction of UFW in the
    oldest part of the city but there is no data available for this area only.

Taiz: Outputs forTaiz include:
•   Production: The extension of additional resources for Taiz was not included in the project as further
    studies were required for exploring potential groundwater and surface water availability.
•   Distribution: Approximately 615 km of new pipes were laid to replace the old leaking network and
    33,000 meters were replaced. Two reservoirs were constructed. This extensive replacement program
    has resulted in an important decrease of the Unaccounted for Water (from 45% in 2001 to 22% in
    2010).




                                                    21
•    Sewerage: The project added over 31 km of sewer lines in Taiz eastern area, including 1,312
     connection chambers. An interceptor was built to convey the eastern area wastewater to the
     wastewater lagoons that were rehabilitated.

AI Bodeidah: IDA's intervention covered the water distribution system and the sewerage network The
development of new water resources wa~ funded by the Islamic Fund through a separate project. Key
outputs are listed below:
•    Production: IDA financed a 27 km Ductile Iron transmission pipe to connect the new well field
     funded by the Islamic Fund to the distribution network.
•    Distribution: The works included 19 km of ductile iron and UPVC pipelines and the replacement of
     12,000 connections.·
•    Sewerage: Expansion of the sewerage network (l,6~0 new connections) and rehabilitation of 1,855
     manholes. Rehabilitation and expansion of the WWTP.

AI-Mukalla: IDA funded water and sanitation infrastructure as follows:
•   Production: Existing boreholes were rehabilitated and new boreholes were drilled.
•   Distribution: No water supply network works funded by the project.
•   Sewerage:
         - Mukalla city: Rehabilitation (old Mukalla) and expansion of networks (October, 30 November
           and Ba'Jiman neighborhoods, An'Nagaa village - total of 2,000 connections). WWTP for
           An'Nagaa.           .
         - Fowah: new network (60 km) - 2,000 connections.
         - WWTP for AI-Mukalla and Fowah (2 x 7,000 m3/day).
         - Ghail Bawazir city: new network (2,7000 new connections). WWTP.

Dhamar (NB: was initially part of the small urban centers):

Works including transmission mains, sewer trunks, reservoirs of 6000 m3 capacities and distribution
netw9rks covering a large part of the city extensions reached 80% achievement at the end of the Project.
They will be fully completed in May 2011.

Aden and 14 small urban centers:

Drilling of test wells.

AI-Qaidah:

Works for a new wastewater collection and treatment system were initiated but suspended for
Contractor's default. They will be completed by March 2012.

Component 2: Institutional support

This component aimed: (i) to support institutional restructuring and to improve managerial capacities of
local corporations; (ii) to put in place an appropriate structure for a regulatory body for the urban water
and sanitation sector in Yemen; (iii) to finance measures to monitor and audit the Private Operator in
Sana'a; (iv) to prepare studies related to the project; and (v) to prepare other water sector projects through
Yemen.


                                                     22
Almost half of the component (US$11.8 million) was used to fund the consulting services required for the
project supervision and the PMU costs.

The support to institutional development and capacity building included mainly: (i) a comprehensive
Technical Assistance to the MWE, the TS and the PMU for water and sanitation sector reform including a
review of the organization, methods, staff and capacity of MWE to identify major shortcomings,
performance evaluation of the 9 LCs and support to the PMU; and (ii) a Technical Assistance for
decentralization of6 branches ofNWSA (AI Bayda, Attaq, Dala'a, Damt, Maber, Mahweet).

The s~dy for the establishment of a Water Sector Regulatory Authority has been carried out but the
Authority has not been created so far.

The project has also funded feasibility studies, environmental assessments and the preparation of Tender
Documents for additional cities to be covered by the Program:
    -   Ibb
    -   Seyoun & Tarim
    -   14 smaller urban centers
    -   A further group of small cities (Haradh, Abs, Sayhout)

It has also funded the feasibility study and preparation of Tender Documents for a brackish water
desalination plant in Taiz and a hydrogeological model for AI-Hodeidah. These studies will be useful for
the GOY to develop the next phase ofthe Program.

A large number of Local Corporations and Autonomous Utilities received basic training on utility
management, but this was certainly far from what was actually needed.

Some office equipment, computer hardware and software, vehicles and machinery were also for the PMU
and five small centers that have been corporatized during the project period.

Component 3: Maintenance Works in Sana'a

This component, to be implemented by the Private Operator, aimed to finance: (i) civil works related to
the maintenance of water and sanitation systems and facilities in the service area; (ii) material and
equipment to carry out the piping network and pumping system maintenance; and. (iii) consultancy
services related to the above two'items.

As neither the Lease Contract nor the Management Contract materialized, those funds were never
disbursed, although they would have been very helpful toSWSLC.

1. Financial Analysis

When recreating the financial analysis as undertaken in the Project Appraisal Document of the Project, it '
should be noted that:

•   The period in which the project was implemented was characterized by high levels of inflation.
    Between 2001 and 2010, the inflation index rose from III to 258 in 2009, which is an annual
    inflation rate of 11 percent (compared to the 5 percent originally anticipated in the PAD). This high
    level of inflation has likely resulted in changes in the relative prices that may have affected the
    performance of the utilities.                          .
•   The scarcity of water has continued unabated. At the time of appraisal, it was also assumed that the
    consumption patterns would remain unchanged, and that water consumption per connection would
    gradually increase. Yet, in all four utilities the average consumption per connection has declined
    compared to the appraisal estimates.
•   The -quality of the data is an issue. The financial data is where possible based on financial audit
    statements, but for 2008, 2009 and 2010 these data are not available. In addition, 2010 data are mostly
    missing partially due to the turmoil in Yemen at the time of the preparation of the ICR that made it
    difficult, if not outright impossible, to collect any additional data.

ThePAD mentions that improving the financial health of the sector is a major objective of the APL
Program. Yet, at the same time, the PAD flagged implicitly the difficulties to achieve sufficient financial
returns from the water supply and sewerage investments. The financial analysis at appraisal assumed that
the Government would continue to provide subsidies that were part of the revenue flow of the utilities
until the end of the project. The fmancial analysis estimated that the subsidies provided by the
Government would continue. During appraisal it was estimated that the four utilities would be provided
with government subsidies of YRL 1,855 million during the lifetime of the project. In addition, the
project also included a component that would provide US$lO million for a maintenance fund for Sana'a.
This project component was eventually cancelled, but essentially the financial analysis at appraisal did
not expect that all, if any, of these utilities would become financially self-sufficient by the end of the
project.

The PAD noted that to be eligible for funding the utilities should be able to ensure full coverage of their
operation and maintenance costs on cash basis. This would imply that the cash collections from water and
sewerage services, new connections and consumer contributions cover all cash operating expenses other
than depreciation. In the four original toWns (Sana'a,. Taiz, Al-Mukallah and Hodeidah), the cash
collections from water and sewerage services has exceeded most of the time the cash expenses. Yet, part
of this achievement is artificially as the accounts payable· have increased very rapidly meaning that
utilities have not been paying their outstanding bills and hence reduced their cash outlays. From 2008
onward, due partially to the escalation of costs, except for Mukallah, none of the other three utilities were
able to cover the cash expenses through their cash income from billing.

Most of the emphasis in the financial analysis was on increasing consumption and tariffs, timely
collection of bills (through a sharp reduction of the accounts receivables), reduction of non-revenue water
and reducing operating expenses (mostly by improving staff productivity). Against these four focus points
to improve. cost efficiency, the utilities showed very mixed progress. Because the progress is so mixed,
we will discuss the performance of each utility separately against these criteria.

Saoa'a

Sana'a has serious water issues. Water production is lower at the end of the project than was foreseen at
appraisal. The water scarcity is also reflected in the high number of operating wells which suggest that it
is getting more difficult to find sustainable water sources. As a result of the· production problems; the
volume of water sold increased significantly slower when the project was under implementation. Because
the number of water and sewerage connections has expanded since the. project started, the volume of
water consumed per connection has been significantly lower than was expected at appraisal. Tariffs
increased, both in nominal and real terms. Collection efficiency remains an issue. In Sana'a, little has
been achieved in improving the collection efficiency - in 2008, the accounts receivable mounted to more
than 8 months of revenues (including government transfers that were booked as revenues).

As far as operational efficiency is concerned, Sana'a utility performance has not really met expectations at
appraisal. Non-revenue water declined, to more or less the levels forecasted at appraisal, but it is likely
that this decline was more the result of lower levels of production than that it was the .result of
improvements in performance. The lack of utilities' management to contain costs is also reflected in the
staff productivity ratio. In Sana'a, staff productivity declined between 2001 and 2008, but has since then
increased rapidly too.

Hence, even though revenues did increase, this increase did not result in much improvements in the
financial sustainability of the company. The operating cost coverage ratio stands at 1.11 in 2007 while it
was 1.05 in 2002. The cash collections from water and sewerage services has also exceeded most of the
time the cash expenses.                                                              .

Taiz

Taiz water scarcity is a major issue. Water production is declining fast. In 2009, the utility produced only
5.4 million cum per year compared to 7.4 million in 2001. The deterioration in water availability is also
reflected in the well drilling profile of the utility. In Taiz, for instance, the PAD forecasted, that the utility
would have 45 wells in 2007 (at the end of the project) with 2 not operating. However, in that year, 98
wells were being managed by the water company Qfwhich more than half (50) were not providing water.
As a result of the production problems, the volume of water sold increased significantly slower when the
project was under implementation. Because the number of water and sewerage connections has expanded
since the project started, the volume of water consumed per connection has been significantly lower than
was expected at appraisal. Tariffs increased, both in nominal and real terms - albeit less rapidly than
forecasted at appraisal. Collection efficiency remains an issue. In Taiz, little has been achieved in
improving the collection efficiency - in 2008, the accounts receivable mounted to more than 7 months of
revenues (including government transfers that were booked as revenues).

As far as operational efficiency is concerned, Taiz utility performance has not really met expectations at
appraisal. Non-revenue water declined, to even below the levels forecasted at appraisal, but this decline
is more the result of lower levels of production than that it was the result of improvements in
performance. The lack of utilities' management to contain costs is also reflected in the staff productivity
ratio .. In Taiz, staff productivity declined between 2001 and 2009, albeit slightly.



                                                         27
Hence, even though revenues did increase, this increase did not result in much improvement in the
financial sustainability of the company. The operating cost eoverage ratio stood at 1.09 in 2009 compared
to 1.10 in 2001. Yet, in 2007 and 2008, the operating cost coverage ratio was around 0.82 - and it is only
the recent tariff increase that has helped this increase in the operating cost coverage ratio. Government
subsidies to cover basic operation and maintenance are hence still needed to ensure that the utility can
operate.

Also, since 2004, the utility has not been able to meet its cash operating expenses with its cash
collections. Although no data is available for 2009, the accounts receivables are increasing suggesting
that the combination of higher tariffs and low levels of consumption does not help to improve collection
efficiency.

Hodeidah

Even though Hodeidah's water problems are less urgent than in Taiz and Sana'a, water production in
Hodeidah increased but much less than what WaS foreseen at appraisal. Subsequently, the volume of water
sold increased significantly slower. Because the number of water and sewerage connections has expanded
since the project started, the volume of water consumed per connection has been significantly, lower than
w,as expected at appraisal. Tariffs increased, but in real terms tariffs actually decreased between 2001 and
2009. Collection efficiency remains an issue. In Hodeidah, collection efficiency declined between 2001
and 2009 as a result the accounts receivable increased to more than 7 months of revenues (including
government transfers that were booked as revenues).



                                                     28
As far as operational efficiency is concerned, utility perfonnance has not really met expectations at
appraisal. Non-revenue water increased. The lack of utilities' management to contain costs is also
reflected in the staff productivity ratio. Staff productivity declined between 2001 and 2009.

Hence, although revenues did increase, this increase did not result in any improvement in the financial
sustainability of the company. The operating cost coverage ratio stood at 1.23 in 2009 compared to 1.50
in 2001. Yet, in 2007 and 2008, the operating cost coverage ratio was around 1.00 - and it is only the
recent tariff increase that has helped this increase in the operating cost coverage ratio. Government
subsidies to cover basic operation and maintenance are hence still needed to ensure that the utility can
operate.

In Hodeidah, the cash collections from water and sewerage services have been decreasing to 90 percent in
2009 and the utility has not been able to meet its cash operating expenses with its cash collections.

MukaUah

Mukallah is the only town in which water consumption per connection has actually increased. Water
production increased from 11.9 million cum per year in 2001 to 22.8 million cum in 2009. Water sold
increased by almost half. Even though the number of water connections increased rapidly, water
consumption per connection increased from 194 cum per connection in 2001 to 211 cum in 2009.


                                                   29
Because the number of water and sewerage connections has expanded since the project started, the
volume of water consumed per connection has been significantly lower than was expected at appraisal.
Tariffs increased, but in real terms tariffs hardly increased between 2001 and 2009. Collection efficiency
remains an issue. In Mukallah, collection efficiency has remained relatively high - fluctuating between
93 and 119 percent between 2001 and 2009. As a result the accounts receivable are very low.

As far as operational efficiency is concerned, utility performance has been able to make improvements.
Non-revenue water has improved between 2001 and 2009 - with NRW declining from 39 percent in 2001
to 34 percent in 2009. The utility was also able to increase staff productivity from 12 staff per 1,000
connections in 2001 to 11 in 2009.

Hence, although revenues did increase, this increase did not result in any improvement in the financial
sustainability of the company - as tariff increases have been limited while costs have increased rapidly.
The operating cost coverage ratio stood at 0.91 in 2009 compared to 1.04 in 2001. Yet, in 2007 and 2008,
the operating cost cdverage ratio was around 1.00 - and it is only the recent tariff increase that has helped
this increase in the operating cost coverage ratio. Government subsidies to cover basic operation and
maintenance are hence still needed to ensure that the utility can operate.

Last, the cash collections from water and sewerage services have been decreasing to 90 percent in 2009
and the utility has not been able to meet its cash operating expenses with its cash collections.

Conclusions
  Despite some improvements, most notably the increase in access to water and wastewater services , the
  financial performance of the utilities is still unsustainable, whether in the short-, medium- or long-term .
. Although it is important that customers get access to services, the current model of service provision is
  not financially sustainable. In general, the utilities do not generate enough revenues to cover their basic
  operation and maintenance costs" and are also not able to cover their cash expenses with the cash
  collections.
The lack of revenues is partially linked to low tariffs. Apart from Sana'a, real tariffs have hardly·
increased since 2001. At the same time, alternatives to piped water - including water from vendors - sell
for $1.40 to $3 per cubic meter. Yet, the small revenue basis of the utilities is also linked to very low
consumption levels. Household surveys suggest that the number of people per connection is very high,
and hence the average per capita water consumption is in some towns not more than 30 liters per capita
per day. Obviously, this consumption is critical for people's livelihood.
Yet, it also suggests that when a project is designed, alternative solutions are to be looked into. Building
a piped network system for such low consumption volumes means high investment costs, and high cost of
operation and maintenance. In the context of increasing water scarcity, and fierce competition for scarce
water resources between sub-sectors (most notably between irrigation and water supply), the question
arises whether the current business model of providing relatively high levels of piped water service to a
relatively small group of customers I that require significant government subsidies and that essentially
benefit richer households is the best way to provide water supply and sanitation services. The Social
Assessment undertaken in November 2001 mentioned the importance of looking into water resource
development as an urgent priority and included alternative options such as rainwater collection and
optimization of water use in irrigation.
The project in hindsight did not address the water scarcity issue into much detail. It was not included in
the critical risks that the project may have to deal with. As such, its assumptions were very optimistic and
it assumed that the project benefits would materialize in an increase in consumption volumes, and
improved performance of utilities that would reduce the cost of the service. Although the project was
based on the premise that the performance of utilities would improve as a result of the Bank's
intervention, almost all project funds were directed towards building infrastructure. The funds available
to strengthen the utilities were very limited, and were not even fully used during project implementation.
Experience from elsewhere shows that building infrastructure without regard to building the capacity to
manage the infrastructure will have a detrimental impact on the long-term sustainability of the project.

2. Economic Analysis

Replicating the economic analysis is fraught with difficulties for a number of reasons:
•   Lack of clarity about the economic analysis as described in the PAD. The PAD does not describe the
    "without project" scenario beyond· the description that without a project overall utility efficiency
    deteriorates and indicators such as unaccounted for water, collection ratios and cost containment
    worsen over time. Yet, in how far these variables would have deteriorated is unclear from the existing
    information, and hence any replication of the economic analysis is likely to be based on a rather
    different "without" project scenario".



1 Access to piped water services in urban areas in Yemen in 2006 was estimated at only 55 percent of the population.
In rural areas, about 28 percent had access to piped water services. Most of the access to piped water services is
benefiting richer households.

•   Supply of water has declined during project imple7f}entation. There is increasingly less water
    available and this is seen in the lower consumption per connection - which has been declining in
    three of the four towns in which the project was implemented. ill the case of Sana'a, tariff increases
    may have put further pressure on water consumption. At appraisal it was assumed that the average
    consumption per 'connection would equal 150 cubic meters per year. Yet, household survey data
    suggests that the number of households per connection exceeds one, and hence these levels of
    consumption are unlikely to be met.
• In several of the four towns, Bank investments were supplemented with investments of other donors.
    This makes it difficult to disentangle the effects of Bank investments and that of other donors and so
    it is also difficult to disentangle the benefits of the project. In the case of Hodeidah, for instance, the
    development of the water resources was funded by the Islamic Development Bank, whereas the Bank
    paid for the transmission and distribution of works.
• Benefit information is incomplete. The benefits of the different projects are hard to assess without the
  . benefit from additional data collection in the field. In the case of Sana's for instance, the project
    included 12,547 new connections, but the additional water provided would only benefit an additional
    2,700 connections.
• Data quality is an issue. Due to the security situation in the country - at the time of data collection
    for' the ICR - many of the data that is needed to undertake an economic analysis could not be
    collected due to the security situation in Yemen.
As a result of the many data deficiencies, it has not been tried to conduct an economic analysis. But we
looked at the cost per unit as described in Annex 2 of the ICR.

Table 3.5 shows the following:

•     The composition of investments funded by the Bank shows some major weaknesses.
         o      In the case of these four towns, water availability is a major concern. Planning an investment
                project without taking these constraints into account results in reduced benefits ... The most
                obvious case is expanding networks while the water produced is declining, and hence the
                expansion investments will be under-used, and hence providing only partial benefits.
         o      In situations of serious water scarcity, rehabilitation of networks - through replacement of
                pipes and installation of water meters - is likely to have limited effects as less water is
                flowing through the pipes. The decline in the water consumption per. connection means that
                increased metering results in less revenues for the utilities, and hence it is likely that the costs
                of the investments are not covered by the benefits. This is. especially the case of the
                rehabilitation investments in Hodeidah, Taiz, and Sana'a. As can be seen in Table 3.6, in
                Taiz the cost of avoiding a reduction in water sold costs $12.98 - significantly higher than the
                costs of water vendors ($3 per CUlU) and about equal to the average costs of bottled water
                ($15).

         o   In case of serious water scarcity, the question also arises how to plan for wastewater networks
             and treatment plants. Treated wastewater can be reused, but with less water being consumed,
             the capacity put in place may also be significantly underused.

•   There are large differentials in the costa/investments. It is likely that some of these differences can
    be due to different hydrological conditions, soil conditions and terrain. Yet, it is worthwhile to better
    monitor the different costs.

•   Too often the benefits 0/ the project cannot be defined. It is important to defme the benefits of the
    different project components. If the Bank funded investments are part of a larger investment plan,
    they should be assessed as part of the total investment plan and associated benefits that are funded by
    multiple donors.

4) Achievements - Outputs and Outcomes:

The First Sta~e:

As we are approaching the end of this stage, which has witnessed implementation of a considerable
number of water supply and sanitation contracts spreading over most of the country particularly in the
main cities and towns, it should be emphasized that the project has been able to complete projects with a
total cost ofUSD 185,000,000.

The overall objective of UWSSP was consistent with the country poverty alleviation strategy, the national
water strategy and the Millennium Goals. The achievement of the overall objective was pursued through
the implementation of the project activities. The project physical progress of activities has been consistent
with targets leading to the achievement of the overall project objectives.

The Most Important Achievements of the Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Project:

        Extension of 800 km of water supply and distribution mains.
        Execution of 251 km of sewer lines.
        Construction of 6 large water reservoirs (6000 cm each).
        Construction of 10 large sewerage rising and pumping stations.
        Implementation of three sewerage treatment plants.
        Drilling and construction of 45 production and investigation boreholes.


4.1 Sana'a:

The Capital of Yemen was one of the first cities to implement major works in rehabilitation of water
supply networks to improve supply and expand the services. This was implemented in three contracts for
rehabilitation works which included installation of mains and secondary lines of polyethylene and ductile
beside the expansion of the water supply network to cover part of south Sana'a. The total cost of these
works under the three contracts is amounting to USD 15,000,000. Direct results in consequence of these
works has been the improvement of water supply and distribution, reduction of water loss and eventually
increase of water supply which contributed to solve the water shortage crises in a major area of the
Capital Secretariat.



                                                    39
A contract for the expansion. of the water network and construction of reservoirs south of the Capital
Secretariat at a cost of USD five million has been implemented. The works included construction of two
five thousand cubic meter reservoirs, distribution and pt.mping lines at the length of 6000 meters with
diameters ranging between 150-500 mm.

Five deep boreholes were drilled south of the Capital at a cost of two million USD. (Three of these
boreholes are fully completed while the other two still to be fitted with casings).

Within the framework of improvement and capacity building of the local cOl:porations and utilities 40,000
water meters were supplied at a cost of USD 1,200,000 to reduce water loss.

The results from implementing the contracts:

a) Improving water resources through the excavation of five deep water wells leading to the increase of
   an estimated water production of 25%.
b) Implementing three contracts for rehabilitation and improvement of the existing water networks to
   serVe a large areal section of the capital and decreasing water loss from 40% to 34%.
c) Importing new water meters that improve water supply and to decrease water loss.
d) Increasing household water connections to about 6000 new houses.
e) Replacing old water meters with new meters in order to improve water supply and Local Corporation
   revenue.

4.2 Taiz:

 The city of Taiz has been suffering, for a long time, from the high percentage of water loss because of the
 deteriorated network and bad distribution of services. As a result, some parts of the city were not covered
 by water and sanitation services. Therefore tender documents were prepared for the rehabilitation and
 replacement of the old water network and expansion of the sewerage networks to cover new areas. The
.total costs of these two contracts are approximately twenty five million USD. As a direct resulte>f the
 implementation of these two projects, the water supply service has considerably improved because of the
 reduction of water loss.

Another ten million USD were spent to extend the sewerage network and rehabilitate the Wastewater
Treatment Plant.

a) Implementing rehabilitation works to the existing deteriorated water networks through the
   implementation of two contract (TAZCW-l & 2) resulted in:
        Reducing water loss from 40% to 22%.
        Fairness and regularity in the distribution of water through the pressure zones.
        Increasing household water connections to about 6000 new houses.
        Improving Local Corporation revenue by reducing water loss and connecting new water meters to
        houses.

b) Expanding the existing sewage lines through the implementation of two contracts (TAZCW-3
   & 5) resulted in:
       Improving health facilities where household wastewater used to run on the streets causing the
       spread of epidemics.


                                                    40
       Extending the new sewer connections to about 8000 new household leading to the Improvement of
       the sewage services and the Local Corporation revenue.
       Through the construction of a wastewater lifting station, a significant disaster was overcome
       where the Western area ofTaiz suffered from the sewage polluting the Basin wells.
       Improving and expanding the wastewater treatment plant to increase its capacity to accommodate
       the wastewater coming from the new sewer lines.

4.3 AI Hodeidah:

Major works were implemented in the City of Al Hodeidah which contributed to the Improvement of
Water Supply Services, details are as follows:
a)    Contract No. (HODCW-4) has been implemented to rehabilitate the water network and house
connections. As a result of these works the water loss has been reduced from 42% to 37% and eventually
water supply improved. Rehabilitating the existing water connections in houses and installing about 4000
new water connection and new meters led to the reduction of water loss, improving water supply and
revenues. The total cost of this project has been around three million USD.
b)     Contract No. (HODCW-l): Installation of Water Transmission Pipeline from a new well in
Marawa'a with a length of 30 km at DN 800 mm. The total cost of this project has been around ten

increasing the Local Corporation's revenue and to meet the increasing needs/demands of the city.
c) Contract No. (HODCW-4A): Completion of Water Transmission Pipline at a length of 7 km and a
cost of two and a half million USD.
d)   Contract No. (HODCW-2): Construction and Extension of the Wastewater Collection System for
new areas in Hay Al Tigari helped to improve the health services. The total cost of this contract has been
six million USD inclusive of the Construction of a Pumping Station.
e) Contract no. (HODCW-3): Expansion and Rehabilitation of the Wastewater Treatment Plant in order
to accommodate the population increase in the city which represents a big achievement. A fence was
constructed around the wastewater treatment plant to protect it.
The total cost has been about six million USD.

4.4 AI Mukallah& Ghail Bawazir:

In spite of the difficulties and delay in implementation of some contracts of Mukallah and Ghail Bawazir,
the executed works should be considered by all measures as great achievements which have provided the
essential services to the population of the two cities, namely, Water Supply and Sanitation Services. The

          Islamic Development Bank (IDB) including the            12,000,000
             grant from the Department of International
              Development (DFID) ofUSD 2 million

                              Total                              150,000,000

 The total cost of these. projects exceeds USD 150 million when add,ing the Government share. These
 amounts are mainly allocated to implement sanitation projects for some urban centers, especially tourist
 centers such as (Damt, Manakhah and Shibam Kawkaban) some other centers will combine both water
 and sanitation projects according to their need.

 The Third Stage:

 In light of the technical Studies carried out by the UWSSP during the first stage and subject to the
 availability of funds more studies have been prepared for the implementation of water and sanitation
 works whether new or improvement and rehabilitation of projects in the following centers and towns:
 (Dhalea, Mahwit, Ataq, Dhamar, Mabar, AI Baidah, Mareb, AI Jawf, Manakhah, Damt, Khamer, Shibam
 Kawkaban).

 Moreover studies have been prepared for the implementation of water and sanitation projects in the
 following towns: (Haradh, Abbs, Habilen, Rahidah, Sayhout, Nadirah).

 The total estimated cost for these projects will, approximately, amount to USD200,000,000.

 5) Project's ratings

 The rating (moderately unsatisfactory) especially in the last years reflects the reduction in disbursement
 and that was not due to the performance of the PMU but came as a result of:

  a) Most of the programmed and scheduled activities during that period have already been completed and
  the accumulated savings came as a direct resJ,llt of the fact that the actual costs of activities such as the
. case in the Taiz and Sana'a contracts were less than the contI:act's value.
 b) The existing saving s from the credit's amount was a direct result of the difference in the prices of the
 dollar and the XDR which contributed to the increase of the credit's provisions.


                                                      44
The rating of project perfonnance should be reconsidered while the project did very big efforts to reach to
those significant outcomes and overcame all obstacles within limited area for movements where all
contracts were signed by incapable LCs. Therefore for justice at least the rating of the project should be
"moderately satisfactory" especially when we differ theperfonnance of the projectand the LCs.

6) PMU Performance:

Throughout the project period the PMU has successfully coordinated with its main partners (WB, MWE,
LCs, LAs and other line of Ministries) and carried out the project procurement of goods, works and
consultancy services as well as the financial issues with acceptable standard. All planned activities of the
project in the PAD have been achieved, as well as the proj~ct DO.

Although some problems have been encountered during project implementation and have slightly affected
the PMU perfonnance, it remains positive from the borrower's perspective and we believe that the PMU
perfonnance can be rated as Satisfactory.

As a matter of fact the PMU should have been worthy of praise because of its ability to implement all the
activities with the minimum of resources and in consequence saved an amount of us $25million which
has been added to the government interest. This should be considered in favor of the PMU perfonnance.

At the same time the PMU undertook successful additional activities in Dhamar and Hodeidah and
prepared studies for six new towns therefore payments were made only for actual implemented activities.

In light of the above we believe that fairness requires reconsideration of the PMU rating. The effort made
towards achievement of the whole activities within the credit provisions and carefulness in disbursements
to ensure that it was made only for actual activities. All these should be fairly evaluated.

It should be taken into consideration that project such with its huge bulk was unique in Yemen its
implementation with all its activities has been a great achievement and needless to say some small defects
should not blur the last outcome particularly when we compare this project other projects financed by the
world Bank which do not represent even 10% of this project's enonnity and diverse activities.

Under item 5-2 implementing agency perfonnance: it has been also mentioned that procurement activities
did not always meet the standard required on a Bank funded project.

Unfortunately this was also not true because:

1- All procurement activities were processed after ensuring acquisition of the WB ''No objection".
2- All procurements procedures were checked by an independent expert hired by the WB.               .
3- Also it is mentioned in this report" Procurement (OPIBP 11.00): Overall, procurement activities
   were acceptable but with substantial deficiencies."
4- The misprocurement mentioned in the report is due to conflicts of interest not related to meeting to
   the procurement standards.

7) Borrower Performance:

The borrower has shown considerable political will to address the water issues and expand the dOQor
recommendations. Many resolutions were made in support of the IDA proposals aiming at improving the
water and sanitation sectorperfonnance.



                                                   45
The borrower has continued to provide the project management with all kinds of support necessary for
project operation.

The project steering committee role has not been decisive in a number of complicated issues and disputes
and did not contribute to a smooth completion of many operations.

8) IDA Performance:

Regular IDA missions were visiting Yemen during the course of the project implementation in order to
follow up activities, provide guidance and recommendations to the project management.

The missions had been launched twice annually and comprise professional technical and financial experts
who were ready to help and exchange their expertise.

The IDA performance during the course of project implementation was generally constructive and
facilitated achievement of the project overall objectives.

The flexible attitude exerted by the mission members was a major factor in solving many problems during
the course of project implementat.ion .

. 9) IDA - Borrower Relationship:

At the beginning of the Project operations the IDA performance was good through the. effort of the TTL
Mr. Alex Bakalian and there were considerable support offered to the project which contributed to an
exceptional performance at that time. The replacement of the TTL by Mr. Richard Pollard at the
beginning of 2009 did not help to continue the successful performance. Perhaps enormity of the project at
the one hand besides the separation of the procurement activity from the TTL overall responsibilities on
the other did not contribute to better manipulation. The assignment of the procurement activity to a
different person in the Sana'a office created a number of problems which might be attributed to inflexible
attitudes assumed by the Procurement Specialist. A lot of rejections and non approvals were suffered
because of minimal mistakes or errors. The result was a delay in some activities which culminated in the
underestimation of the project's grade.

In general terms the overall relationships between IDA and the borrower had been fruitful in terms of
addressing the project needs and achieving its objectives.

10) Sustainability and Future Operation:

In order to ensure sustainability of the implemented' projects the following points were taken into
consideration:
      1)   Completion and integration of"activities through confirmation of operation and maintenance
           by a well equipped LC.
      2)   Exploration and improvement of water resources to ensure sustainable supply.
      3)   Training and capacity building for LCs and utilities besides full support. provided by the PMU.

11) Probl~ms encountered during UWSSP implementation

Three serious problems encountered during the course of implementation and led to a notable delay in the
Project implementation beyond its targeted time framework. As a result, the project was granted ~


                                                   46
extension period, and PMU was instructed to shift the uncompleted activities after the extension period
and credit closing date to the new existing water sector support program,- WSSP. The problems include:
1) Frequent interventions by the residents in the contractor's works and stoppage of the work in order to
   change the sites and locations of the sewerage structures and pipelines, and lack of prompt action
   from security authorities in resolving such disputes between the contractors and the residents.
2) Poor performance of some contracted companies which failed to' carry out the intended work in an
   efficient way and timely manner, therefore enforcing the PMU, in critical cases, to terminate the
   contract and reissue the task.
3) Weak participation of the LCs during the course of implementation in terms of support, or
   supervision or solving problems.


12) Key Lessons Learned

1) 'Verification should' be done on the ground for the selected locations of the sewerage structures and
    pipelines before designing, in order to ensure site clearance and avoid any problems and stoppages
    that may occur by inhabitants during implementation. An example of such problems was the selected
    sites of lifting and pumping stations for Al Mukalla sanitation and Treatment Plant.
2)   Participation of all related entities (LCs, security authorities, line of ministers, local communities
     etc.) during the course of implementation is essential to avoid unforeseen obstacles and ensure
     smooth achievement.
3)   The relationship between the Project Management and Local Corporations was not clearly defined as
     well as responsibilities which adversely affected implementation. In this regard some decisions taken
     by the Local Corporations eventually led to disputes, contract terminations, prolonged legal
     procedures and financial liabilities.
4)   The saved amounts resulting from the (XDR) difference against the dollar (around US$30 million)
     has been considered as bad performance in absorbing the credit proceeds which ultimately adversely
     affected the project grading.
5)   The TTL replacement, towards the end of th~ Project closing date, played a negative role in the
     project progress therefore such decisions must be profoundly studied. As we have indicated earlier
     the problem did not arise from the action of replacement in itself or caliber of the person replaced but
     from the timing of the procedure towards the end of the project completion. Needless to say,
     sufficient time is needed to enable any new TTL to address and to familiariZe himself with the
     project operations in the different Yemeni Regions with their diverse complexities and problems. It
     was natural, for any new arrival, to take time before initiating approvals or disapprovals.
     Unfortunately that happened while the project was approaching the closing date and time was very
     precious. Moreover, the fact that the procurement task had been assigned to a different person, who
     assumed throughout an inflexible position, led to delays in many operations and therefore directly
     affected the project performance.
6)   The Steering Committee did not play the required role in ,support of the Project. The selection of its
     members has not been perfect. In some urgent situations it had been impossible to hold the required
     meeting since some of the members belonged to different entities and therefore couldn't attend these
     meetings for being busy elsewhere. Some members intervened sometimes in tasks and procedures
     inconsistent with their responsibilities.

           ANNEX 6: Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders


Comments received from the Technical Secretariat of the Ministry of Water and Environment: .

Only one year after the establishment of the autonomous Sana'a Water Supply and Sanitation Local
Corporation (SWSLC), the World Bank came to the conclusion that it is not performing well and that if it
enters into a PPP option it would improve its performance indicators. In the late nineties of last century
the World Bank was provoking the necessity of PPP. In order to introduce PPP in SWSLC, the WB
promised the Yemen government that it will provide Yemen with 120 mi $ soft loan for the urban water
sector. A quick cost benefit analysis was made by the World Bank which concluded that lease contract
option is the most appropriate for SWSLC. Neither SWSCL nor the Ministry of Electricity & Water were
convinced that the private sector will be interested to enter in a PPP lease contract in Yemen because the
framework conditions which were not conducive were taken into consideration. Nevertheless, the
government accepted the WB proposal, and started the transaction process w~ich took about 18 months
with help of an international legal firm.                           .

The process failed because it was donor driven, SWSLC was advocating that it· just became an.
autonomous corporation and that if it were given the same tools and freedom as the private operator it
would perform better. In addition, the private operators were not convinced because of water scarcity,
high level of poverty, lack of interest on the SWSLC, very high bank guarantees included in the LC
tender document, absence of an independent regulatory agency, difficulty in adjustment of the tariff, lack
of communication strategy together with a strong opposition from Sana'a LC employees to the lease
contract concept and the difficulty of law enforcement.
