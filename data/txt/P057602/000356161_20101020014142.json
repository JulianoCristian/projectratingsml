the Municipal Water Project implementation, and,\n            focuses specifically on the city of Taiz, based on a\n            comprehensive strategy, planned for the development of water\n            supply, and wastewater collection and disposal in the city,\n            to cover a period through 2020. Despite expected\n            overwhelming, positive environmental impacts, the EA\n            identified both major, and secondary environmental issues,\n            proposing mitigation measures as follows. The major issues\n            are: 1) incidence of malaria surrounding water, and\n            sanitation works - the health sector's national malaria\n            program will be supplemented primarily through vector\n            control strategies, targeted at controlling mosquito\n            breeding areas, while, Insecticide Treated Bed-nets (ITB)\n            will also be provided; 2) disposal of dried sewage sludge -\n            the development of a wastewater treatment, and sludge reuse\n            policy will address the long-term solutions needed,\n            following the rehabilitation of lagoons, and water supply\n            systems; and, 3) handling of chemicals during the process of\n            the water system rehabilitation - precautionary clauses will\n            include contractor's responsibility for training\n            workers on chemical handling, and on provision of adequate\n            safety gear, and, a contingency plan will specify measures\n            for spill prevention, and hazardous chemical control. Other\n            measures include soil contamination testing; fencing the\n            surrounding areas to safeguard traffic; appropriate\n            wastewater disposal at selected sites during construction;\n            and, installation of screens, and barriers to abate noise,\n            and air pollution."}, "docdt": "2009-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
