7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
PDO: To provide efficient and sustainable water and sanitation services in Yemen's major urban areas.
APL Program Purpose and Phasing: To provide efficient and sustainable water and sanitation services in
Yemen's urban areas through: A. Increase in urban water supplies initially through improved operation and
reduction of water losses (Phase I), and subsequently, through development of new water resources
including the reuse of wastewater (Phase II). B. Improvement of sector management through establishment
of financially viable regional corporations with significant participation of the private sector. C. Provision
of affordable sewerage facilities that assure protection of the environment and permit the reuse of

2.      The project is entering its final year of implementation. The Project Management
Unit (PMU) is working diligently to ensure that all ongoing and planned activities are
completed during the final year of implementation without the delays that have affected
the project in previous years.

3.       The proposed reallocation is necessary for the following reasons:

                                             3
a. Category 1-A ­ additional XDR 11,750,000: Additional Works within the
   overall scope of the project activities outlined in the Project Appraisal
   Document (PAD) have been or are under implementation in Hodeidah
   (connection line), Dhamar (Water expansion and sewage), 2 more wells for
   Sana'a (after cancellation of previous contracts) and variation orders to
   complete the Mukalla Sewage Project. Environmental and social assessments
   have been completed for all sub-projects.

b. Category 1-B ­ less with XDR 7,500,000: This category was expected to be
   used in Phase II of the Adaptable Program Loan (APL) project, which was
   cancelled. The PAD expected rehabilitation and expansion of water and
   sanitation services in six towns. Only smaller proportions are complete and a
   total of US$6.2 m is expected to be contracted for Al Qaeda Municipality very
   shortly.

c. Category 1-C ­ less XDR 4,000,000: This category was earmarked in the
   PAD to support a lease contract to manage the Sana'a water and sanitation
   corporation. In practice a Performance Contract has been put in place instead
   of a lease contract, with the agreement of the Bank. To help management
   achieve their performance objectives the project supported the performance
   contract with procurement of additional meters and equipment, which is now
   accounted for under Category 1 B. Additional training provided is now under
   Category 3.

d. Category 2 ­ Goods ­ less with XDR 1,950,000: Some goods, e.g. meters,
   cars, equipment, have been packaged into construction contracts. This
   includes meters acquired for Sana'a and Hodeidah. The savings are therefore
   shifted to Category 1A.

e. Category 3 ­ Consultants and training ­ additional XDR 3,000,000: As a
   consequence of the increased activity under Category 1A there is a need for
   additional studies and supervision contracts. Increased training activities
   during the last year with more to be completed before project closure also
   adds to this category.

f. Category 5 ­ Unallocated ­ less XDR 1,300,000: The project is now so
   close to completion that unallocated amounts have to be utilized in the
   categories that need it.
