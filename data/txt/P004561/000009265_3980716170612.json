Some lessons learned included: multi-agency\n            type of projects should be avoided; where National\n            Government Agencies are involved, it is recommended that a\n            single agency serve as the executing agency. Projects should\n            support decentralization where projects are planned and\n            implemented by the Local Government Units (LGU), National\n            Government Agencies (NGA) can provide the executing agency\n            role, Provincial Government can assist with technical\n            assistance, supervision and monitoring, and the Municipality\n            and Barangay should be the focus of implementation. Cost\n            recovery principles should be promoted and implementing\n            agencies, i.e., LGUs, should borrow funds for investments\n            and be fully accountable for them. All Government agencies\n            with both direct and peripheral responsibility to the\n            project should be involved from the earliest stages of\n            project preparation. Planning, designing and implementation\n            of sub-projects by LGUs should be based on need and demand\n            and in close consultation and participation with the community."}, "docdt": "1998-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
