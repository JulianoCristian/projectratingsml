ODS (ozone depleting substances)\n            production and use of primary CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons)\n            were phased out through the implementation of the\n            sub-projects and legislative enactment. In addition to\n            meeting some of the incremental costs of phase-out, this\n            GEF-funded (Global Environment Facility) project enabled\n            appropriate Western technologies to be identified and\n            introduced into the country. Despite these positive\n            outcomes, the performance of the 3R component (recovery,\n            reclamation, and recycling) was unsatisfactory. Lessons\n            learned from this project include: 1) Establishing and\n            improving the proper legal and regulatory framework, and the\n            institutional system were essential. 2) All sub-projects\n            experienced a \"learning curve\" as ideas and\n            technologies imported from the West needed adapting before\n            they could be transferred. 3) Earlier legislation\n            encouraging the recovery of refrigerants by imposing a heavy\n            excise duty on CFCs backfired to some degree. The report\n            also evaluates the cooperation of beneficiaries; bank\n            performance in preparing, appraising, and implementing the\n            project; the need for the project implementation unit and\n            its manager to be given authority to take a more proactive\n            role; the effect of commercial incentives for participants;\n            and the now principal challenge of making the entire 3R\n            scheme reach its anticipated capacity."}, "docdt": "1998-08-27T00:00:00Z"}
