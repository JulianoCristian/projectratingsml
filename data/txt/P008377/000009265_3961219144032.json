Specifically this project will assist the Czech\n            Republic to: a) initiate the phase out of the production of\n            chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs); b) phase in the operation of a\n            national network for refrigerant recovery/reclamation/\n            recycling; and c) support applied engineering efforts to use\n            ODS substitutes in manufactured goods, thereby reducing the\n            immediate and future needs for regulated subjects. There are\n            5 sub-projects including: a) engineering assistance for ODS\n            production phaseout; b) design and operation of CFC\n            refrigerant reclamation facilities and establishment of\n            refrigerant recovery capacity in the national network of\n            servicing companies; c) introduction of non-ODS refrigerant\n            in the commercial, industrial and refrigerated transport\n            sectors; d) introduction of non-ODS insulation technologies\n            in cold room panel manufacturing; and e) setup of a project\n            management unit (PMU)."}, "docdt": "1994-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
