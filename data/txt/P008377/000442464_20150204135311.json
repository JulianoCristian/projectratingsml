All\n            chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) production was phased out, a\n            national network for refrigerant recovery reclamation and\n            recycling (3R) was introduced, and technology changes were\n            implemented to use ODS substitutes in manufacturing goods,\n            mainly refrigeration and commercial, industrial cooling\n            applications. GEF support provided an incentive for the\n            early adoption of ODS phase-out activities and captured\n            additional environmental and economic benefits which\n            otherwise will have been lost or delayed. The GEF project\n            consisted of five subprojects, including four investment\n            subprojects and one institutional strengthening subproject.\n            One sub-project, which involved funding a feasibility study\n            to convert CFC production facilities was abandoned when it\n            was assessed that there will be no profitable market for the\n            new products. The Czech Ministry of Environment considers\n            improving the effectiveness of the 3R scheme by a national\n            program and hopes to address the shortcoming in particular\n            by special training activities to be conducted by the\n            association of refrigeration servicemen (green card)."}, "docdt": "2004-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
