3. Program Description

3.1 Overall Program

1. The adjustment loan under review, in the amount of Euro 82.5 million (US $100 million
equivalent), is the first of a three single-tranches programmatic Public Administration Reform
Adjustment Loan (PARL) for Morocco. The operation, approved by the Board on July 1, 2004,
supports the implementation of the government's public administration reform program while
ensuring long term fiscal sustainability. The reform program supported by the PARL includes
three components: a) budgetary reforms designed to improve the efficiency of public expenditure;
b) a reform of civil service management; and c) measures to keep the wage bill at a sustainable
level over time. The reform program was built on a solid diagnostic background, including a
2002 Bank-supported participative Public Expenditure Review (Annex 4), and it was
complemented with technical assistance through Programmatic Economic and Sector Work and
Institutional Development Fund grants. PARL I was developed jointly with the EU, which added
a structural adjustment grant of Euros 79 millions to be disbursed in four tranches. The AfDB
also prepared a structural adjustment loan of about 120 million units of account.

2. The task is fully consistent with the CAS 2001-2004, which stresses, inter alia, (page
numbers in parentheses) the reform of the State (9-10), the heavy burden of the wage bill (10-12),
the fiscal sustainability issue (13-14), institution building (21), and the efficiency of public
expenditures (23). Moreover, the fiscal and other triggers include containing the wage bill and
other current expenditures, and improving the incentive framework for the civil service (28).

3. The PARL full policy matrix is provided in Annex I.                    The main policy actions were
developed through extensive consultations with all relevant government counterparts. The matrix
covers the period 2003-2006 and includes three components, with the following objectives: (A)
improving the efficiency of budget expenditure by deconcentrating expenditure and
accountability and introducing performance budgeting and auditing: (i) strengthening medium-
term expenditure planning, (ii) delegating responsibilities to field managers while introducing
performance related budgeting, and (iii) streamlining compliance controls, while strengthening
reporting and performance auditing and evaluation. (B) Implementing a reform of the civil
service by: (i) improving consistency between staffing and missions within ministries, (ii)



                                                       3

rationalizing personnel management, while increasing efficiency in evaluation, remuneration, and
promotion, and (iii) In-service training.      (C) Ensuring a sustainable macro framework by
controlling inter-alia the magnitude of the civil service payroll.

4. The fiscal adjustment program supported by this loan covers the period 2003-2007. It targets
a reduction of the fiscal deficit of some 0.5 percentage points annually and a drop in the central
government's total-debt-ratio from 69.8 percent in 2003 to 66 percent in 2009. Key actions to
improve the fiscal position include the restructuring of the public sector and lowering the wage
bill from 12.4 percent of GDP in the 2004 Budget Law to less than 11 percent in 2009; the latter
is to be achieved through an early retirement scheme over four years targeting some 60,000 civil
servants. Additional savings are expected from the adoption of an improved civil service statute
able to increase efficiency in the promotion and remuneration system, and the progressive move
towards deconcentration and results oriented budgeting.


3.2 PARL I


5. The specific actions for the loan under review, PARL I, are outlined and discussed in Annex
II. This loan addressed issues related to the effectiveness of government services and the
sustainability of the fiscal framework. The Loan's administration was under the responsibility of
the Ministry of Finance and the coordination and monitoring of the program was supported by the
Inter-ministerial steering committee through its permanent secretariat provided by the Ministry of
Economic Affairs and General Affairs.


4. Achievement of Objectives and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/ achievement of objective

6. ICR Rating: Satisfactory. Overall, the PARL I program was successful in meeting its
objectives, despite a few shortcomings, discussed below and with more details in the matrix. As
shown in ANNEX III -Table 1, the overall macro economic framework was satisfactory with the
exception of the rise in the ratio of the wage bill from the projected 12.4 of GDP to 13 percent of
GDP, the results of wage rate increases to particular sectors of the civil service. Most conditions,
triggers and targets for 2004 identified in the policy matrix and prior actions for the PARL II have
been met without modifications and few exceptions. Implementation of the program made strides
towards improving public resource management and set the basis for an efficient management of
the civil service.


4.2 Output by Components

7. A detailed presentation of the accomplishments of the program per component is presented in
Annex II with their respective ICR ratings for each subcomponent. One subcomponent (B3) and
one component (C) received an unsatisfactory rating. The rationale for the valuation of each
component is provided below




                                                  4

A. Improving the efficiency of budget expenditures by deconcentrating expenditure and
accountability and introducing performance budgeting and auditing

ICR - Satisfactory

8. The process associated with the development of a medium-term expenditure framework
(MTEF) is being implemented and - with some difficulties - mainstreamed. The consistency
between the macroeconomic framework and the sector strategies in the pilot institutions is
beginning to appear and the Government is serious in its intention to delegate responsibilities to
field managers while introducing performance-related budgeting. Compliance controls are being
streamlined, reviewed and monitored according to plans. The strengthening of reporting and
performance auditing and evaluation is a process which is ongoing, and has had some delays.
However, in this arena too, the progress is tangible and initial delays are being progressively
absorbed.    These are important achievements which warrant the satisfactory rating above.
Nevertheless, the present lack of a steering committee which actively monitors the reform efforts
could have sustainability implications and thus should be put in place very quickly, as it will
provide invaluable leadership in reform implementation.

B. Implementing civil service reform

ICR - Satisfactory

9. The bulk of the work under in this area is in sub-component B1. This type of work tends to
be extremely time and resource consuming. Yet the Government has taken ownership buying
into all aspects of this very massive and long winded endeavor. They have created an
implementing structure headed by the highest levels of Government, and have met regularly on
average every six months. The requirements of component B are mostly associated with creating
a legal and regulatory framework, which will enable reform at this stage.           Most of these
requirements have been met. The technical work undertaken in the two pilot ministries is
ongoing and virtually on time. On the basis of these achievements, a satisfactory rating is
warranted for the implementation of the civil service reform.             Subcomponent B3 was
unsatisfactory because the Government failed to approve a draft decree on in-service training, yet
this is not surprising because pilot re-engineering work has not yet been finalized. This should be
taken into account in the design of the next phase.

C. Consolidation and control of the public payroll

ICR - Unsatisfactory

10. The objective of component C was to control the unsustainable rise in the civil service wage
bill. Diagnostics indicated that while the number of civil servants was not excessive, the average
salary of civil servants appeared well above international comparators both in absolute terms and
in comparison to countries with similar income levels. Measures identified under this component
aimed to keep the wage bill under control or even reduce it in the interim. They included an early
retirement mechanism, and yearly quantitative measures on recruitment and promotion aimed at
avoiding promotion bottlenecks experienced under the current extremely restrictive system. The
setting up of a voluntary early retirement mechanism was studied by the MoF on the assumption
of 20,000 to 60,000 departures and these assumptions had been tested. However, only 6,700 civil
servants were retired under the original scheme layout for the years 2004/5. This is well below
the anticipated level of 20,000 employees expected to exit the civil service by the year 2005.




                                                  5

11. The early retirement scheme benefits was recently amended and enhanced. Eligibility for the
program was extended to all levels of civil service, contrasting the previous scheme which
applied only to levels 1-9 and banned the participation of senior servants. Benefits were increased
from 1 to 1.5 months of gross compensation per year of service with a ceiling of 36 months for
grades 6 and over. Additionally, the system considers in the budget law 2005 a pension increase
of 2.5% by year of service for agents that attained the age limit. Early returns on the new scheme
are encouraging. The new structure of the early retirement program expects to attract 8-10,000
employees in 2005, which would have great impact on payroll, but its effects will only
materialize with the effective enforcement of the zero net increase clause in the public sector. In
order to enforce greater control over the wage bill, decrees were passed for a hiring freeze at the
levels 1-4 in 2004 and were included in the budget law for 2005. A ministerial circular was
produced to prohibit the hiring of temporary personnel in accordance to the gradual elimination of
it, as considered in the PAD, which was also included in the budget law 2005. The adoption of a
zero net hiring freeze will have a long term effect stabilizing the number of civil servants.

12. Despite eventual progress with the early retirement scheme, the wage bill increased during
PARL I and is a cause for concern. In contrast with the overall objectives of the reform, the
Government introduced targeted salary increases for civil servants in the early period of project
implementation. While understandable in terms of political economy these increases worsened
the fiscal situation. A principal objective of the PARL was to help provide discipline to a
government subject to many political pressures. This discipline was not achieved during the
period of PARL I. On the basis of these results, the ICR must conclude that the performance of
this component was unsatisfactory.


4.3 Institutional Development Impact and Sustainability


13. Institutional Development Impact ICR Rating: Modest. The PARL is a comprehensive,
detailed and coherent economic framework for reform, with a strong emphasis on multi-sectoral
cooperation and extensive interchange between donors and the government. Reaching the desired
outcomes will require significant institutional changes that are likely to improve the effectiveness
of public service. It is expected that the impact of implementing the MTEF, conducting in-depth
civil service reform, and the reduction and management of the wage bill would be quite
substantial in the medium term. At the moment, however, work is just beginning.

14. The main impact of the PARL project during the review period has consisted in creating an
environment conducive for reforms and in strengthening inter-ministerial collaboration. The loan
and the accompanying P-ESW (Annex 4) have served as a vehicle for the articulation of a
comprehensive medium-term framework for economic policy and institutional reform, a rallying
device to push the implementation of key measures in the public sector reform program.

15. Sustainability ICR Rating: Satisfactory. The multiple single tranche operation design
accompanied by the Programmatic ESW, around a comprehensive program with clearly
identifiable milestones and triggers, provides the framework for a systematic monitoring,
evaluation and dialogue with the Moroccan authorities. The participation of multiple donors in
support of the Government's reform program, the current geopolitical situation which seems to
heighten international scrutiny to the process of governance reform in the region, and the
pressures of the Association Agreement with Europe, provide additional incentives for the
Moroccan Government to maintain the course on the program. The effort to institutionalize a
body representing different parts of government and civil society to guide the civil service reform
program     (The Supreme Council of Civil Service) is a promising way to improve both


                                                 6

implementation and sustainability of reforms, but needs further strengthening. Finally, the Bank
has provided critical international experience, thus ensuring quality control.


5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome


16. The project enjoyed strong endorsement from the highest authorities in Morocco, the King,
the Prime Minister, and the Minister of Finance. The Prime Minister supported the reform from
its start and put pressure on the government to move ahead and to solve problems that emerged.
The end results are tangible actions undertaken on issues that had been previously stalled and the
development of momentum for continued reform.

17. The implementing agency performed well in pursuing a complex reform program.
Cooperation with other ministries and administrations proved to be difficult at first, but is
improving. The reform program and the work under the P-ESW have placed a significant
administrative burden on the agency, nevertheless, it was able to maintain close and fruitful
contact with the donors and was very effective in facilitating the work of very large missions.

18. On the negative side, there has been great difficulty to date to obtain and provide
coordination and sustained dialogue on difficult policy items. Far too often, coordination between
ministries is cumbersome and steering committees, which aimed to play that role, are not being
set up in a timely fashion or are ineffective. This end result leads to an occasional loss of
momentum on important items of the program.

6. Bank and Borrower Performance


Bank

19. Satisfactory. The Bank's performance is rated satisfactory. The design choice of a series of
single tranche adjustment which are governed by a medium term program with triggers for each
subsequent operation allows for flexibility in achieving programmatic objectives. This design
maintains donor leverage and reinforces the hand of the reformers in the government.

20. Throughout preparation and implementation the Bank played a catalytic role in gathering
ideas and people, as well as transferring knowledge and debunking problems and contentious
issues. The design of the program greatly benefited from a base of analytical work done in a
highly participatory way as part of the PER while implementation of the PARL was aided by
analytical work undertaken under the PESW and close supervision of the PARL which provided
follow-up missions, and a mid-term review (Annex 4). Indeed, Bank and EU resources were
effectively utilized to closely monitor development on an average of every three to four months.
IBRD missions systematically maintained contact with all project stakeholders ­ government
officials, unions, ­ thus removing potential roadblocks to project implementation.

Borrower

21. Satisfactory.    The Moroccan Government's performance is also rated satisfactory. The
Borrower took ownership of the reform effort and reiterated its willingness to reform at all levels
of the executive. To achieve the reform goals, the Government involved excellent professionals
in the work of the P-ESW, and worked diligently to solve problems and arrive to a
comprehensive multi faceted program. The Government had shown some difficulty in achieving




                                                  7

cooperation before along different ministries or in the context of a multi-pronged operation, and
this has improved during implementation.

22. The Ministry of Finance and the MMSP were constructive counterparts for the Bank and
other donors throughout preparation and implementation. They were effective in managing the
program despite the difficulties associated with cooperating across government departments. As
the program proceeds into the implementation stage, the ability to rely on a core group of very
motivated, competent counterparts will become increasingly difficult and will not be able to
substitute for real cross government coordination. The reform program placed a significant
burden on the MOF, which led sometimes to incomplete reporting practices. In those instances,
the Bank was able to engage such ministry significantly and problems were solved quickly and
without controversies.


7. Findings and Implications for Subsequent Operation(s) in Series


23. Ownership by multiple stakeholders is necessary for success of reform programs; PARL
II should consider how to broaden support for the reforms, including the need for wage bill
containment. Ensuring ownership at the highest levels of government as well as at the technical
levels is essential for increasing commitment to the project development objectives and
facilitating implementation. Involving other stakeholders in discussions of the reform program
would be useful, particularly with regard to the wage bill and the need to halt salary increases.
The Bank can play a role as a "technical resource" and help build this ownership.

24. The link between the civil service reform program and the more macro objective of
wage bill containment has not been strong in the early years of the PARL program and
PARL II should consider how to strengthen the linkage. Containing the wage bill appears to
have been more difficult than anticipated since program measures were completed yet the wage
bill still rose. Resisting the political pressure to increase salaries is difficult for any government
and indeed was one of the principal motivations for the government to request this loan.
Preparation for PARL II should involve a careful discussion with the government about the wage
bill and consideration of how to possibly design stronger measures to help the government resist
further increases.

25. The early retirement scheme was eventually able to attract sufficient participants but an
analysis of this scheme should be completed to understand both its fiscal costs and the
human resource costs. While the early retirement scheme eventually drew the number of
participants sought, it did so by changing the rules of the scheme (i.e. permitting higher level civil
servants to retire and providing more generous benefits).

26. Reforms requiring interministerial coordination moved slowly; thus attention needs to
be placed on how to strengthen coordination. While many actions were taken under this loan,
ones requiring inter ministerial coordination did not proceed well and the spirit of the public
sector reforms lies in implementation across ministries.             The issue of inter ministerial
coordination was addressed in PARL I through support of the Supreme Council of Civil Service.
Details of this council need further attention and support under PARL II e.g. membership,
leadership, mission and accountability. Experience in many countries indicates that public sector
reform must be led by a body above all others (e.g. prime minister's office).

27. Institutional reform requires long term involvement and partnership between the Bank
and the client; thus the PARL instrument appears to be appropriate, albeit with risks. The



                                                   8

programmatic adjustment loan appears to be the appropriate instrument for supporting public
sector reforms in Morocco as the country is proceeding step by step in a medium term program.
Using successive single tranche adjustment loans is an effective way to assist structural reform,
provided it is linked rigidly to an agreed medium-term reform program with well defined
milestones and transparent triggers per subsequent operation. The risk of the PARL is twofold.
First, a medium term program supported by the PARL does not provide a sufficiently long
timeframe to ensure that all the little steps taken eventually lead to the public sector reform and
results envisioned. Second, the nature of the programmatic loan is such that it provides the
flexibility to modify milestones and triggers and thus, there may be a risk of continually
proceeding with easier measures and continuing to be blocked on others posing persistent
institutional challenges (e.g. the interministerial coordination necessary for the MTEF).

28. The Bank's analytical work and technical assistance helped the Government design the
reform program; continuing to support the program through the PESW is important but
must be tailored appropriately and flexibly to demands. The Bank's AAA and ESW program
played a key part in helping Morocco prepare and internalize the necessary reforms. This
program, started in 1995 and provided in depth analysis and benchmarking which eventually
proved useful in the design of the project in 2004. Ongoing analytical work, technical assistance,
short policy notes or convening roundtables or workshops are all valuable forms of assistance but
need be tailored appropriately to the demands at the time. The programmatic PESW provides
resources to accompany the government in this reform.

29. Donor coordination plays a major role in program success and the Bank should make
great efforts to preserve this unified dialogue. The Bank's lending operation and the EC
Structural adjustment grants, and in some respect the AfDB support of the Moroccan government
are based on the same programmatic framework. This has benefited the client by building
credibility for the reforms, but also focusing the attention and expertise from multilateral donors
to a complex program of reform. For the Bank and donors it has helped to mitigate the
reputational risk of this type of reform and has reduced the supervisory burden on each donor.

                          contracts with their ministry in which their operations are presented on a program-budget basis, which will greatly impact
                          results. The managers will be authorized to shift resources between line items within a same program, provided they commit
                          to results, as measured by the program performance indicators.

                              Done. The early retirement scheme was launched and 6,700 civil servants retired under the original scheme layout for
                              the years 2004/5; well below the projections of 20,000 employees by the year 2005. It was later redesigned with a more
                              attractive package and eligibility extended to all levels (the previous scheme applied only to levels 1-9). Benefits were
                              increased from 1 to 1.5 months of gross compensation per year of service with a ceiling of 36 months for grades 6 and
                              over. Additionally, the system considers through the budget law 2005, a pension increase of 2,5% by year of service for
                              agents that attained the age limit. Early returns on the new scheme are encouraging. The new structure of the early
                              retirement program expects to attract 8-10,000 employees in 2005, which would have great impact on payroll, but its
                              effects will only materialize with the enforcement of the zero net increase clause in the public sector.

                    Brief Overview of the Programmatic P-ESW on Public Administration

A multi-year programmatic ESW (P-ESW) to provide analytical and advisory services to the Government of
Morocco in support of a variety of public sector issues and reform opportunities was undertaken in parallel with
the structural adjustment operation. In its first year, FY03, the general objective was to help design an overall
reform strategy for public financial and human resources, whether or not it might be followed by a lending
operation.

In the second year, FY04, the activities under the task were wholly linked to the SAL preparation, and the
substantial task budget constituted in effect supplementary financing for the SAL processing. The strongest
component of the P-ESW is on the financial resource management side, where program budgeting is being
introduced gradually in Morocco and without either compromising the overall budgeting system or weakening
financial integrity and compliance. The civil service reform component is a position classification exercise.

This was a task that combined advisory services, technical information brokerage, and direct technical
assistance. Outputs consisted of various aide memoirs of joint missions with the EU, and various technical
papers. The outputs were:

    · A paper summarizing the recent trends of budgetary policy (to promote a common understanding of the
        elements of a budgetary policy),
    · A paper on the use of information technology to manage human resources,
    · A major report on the management of human resources in the public administration.

The task's clients were primarily the Ministries of Finance and Civil Service and the recommendations
emerging from the work were aimed primarily at them. The dissemination that occurred covered, therefore,
largely the diagnosis, the knowledge developed, the experience of other countries, the reasons and options for
change, etc. This took the form of workshops and seminars which combined dissemination with training.

The task was subjected to a Quality Assurance Group Review (QAG) which concluded that the process has
contributed to a consensus on the reforms needed among the various ministries concerned, and perhaps the idea
of working together--rather than in silos--will endure. While a number of the actions (on civil service reform,
especially) are merely first steps, they represent a public commitment to reform by the Government.
Concerning the sensitive civil service reform, the Government has consulted the various unions which cover
government workers, and these seem to be on board. The various workshops and training activities seem to
have contributed to a better understanding of the reforms, their justification and the action/skills needed for their
successful implementation. The Bank's own work is to continue under the three-year programmatic ESW
whose extension has recently been approved by the Country Department. The TTL for both the PESW and the
SAL has been transferred to the field, a decision on which the authorities concerned expressed satisfaction to
the Panel. Finally, this task has the benefit of strong synergy with two related activities--the CFAA and FSAP
(joint Bank-IMF financial sector assessment)--which have received strong government support.
