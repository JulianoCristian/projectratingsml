Lessons\n            learned from the project: Ownership by multiple stakeholders\n            is necessary for success of reform programs. The link\n            between the civil service reform program and the more macro\n            objective of wage bill containment has not been strong in\n            the early years of the Public Administration Reform\n            Adjustment Loan (PARL) program and PARL II should consider\n            how to strengthen the linkage. The early retirement scheme\n            was eventually able to attract sufficient participants but\n            an analysis of this scheme should be completed to understand\n            both its fiscal costs and the human resource costs. Reforms\n            requiring inter-ministerial coordination moved slowly.\n            Institutional reform requires long term involvement and\n            partnership between the Bank and the client. The Bank's\n            analytical work and technical assistance helped the\n            Government design the reform program. Donor coordination\n            plays a major role in program success and the Bank should\n            make great efforts to preserve this unified dialogue."}, "docdt": "2005-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
