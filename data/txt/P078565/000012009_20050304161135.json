It includes: (1) improving the\n            efficiency of  budget expenditure by de-concentrating\n            expenditures and accountability to enable greater\n            flexibility to regional administrations, and by introducing\n            performance budgeting and auditing; (2) implementing a\n            reform of the civil service based on enhancing efficiency\n            and service quality; and (3) ensuring a sustainable\n            macroframework, by controlling, among other things, the\n            magnitude of  the civil service payroll. Based on an agreed\n            set of  public administration reforms, the Bank will provide\n            resources to the Government. The loan will be the first in a\n            series of annual programmatic loans supporting the\n            implementation of the reform program. The loan will\n            complement and strengthen the ongoing multi-year Economic\n            and Sector Work (ESW) activity through which the Bank is\n            providing the Government with advice, training, and\n            technical assistance as required in the areas of budgetary\n            management and civil service."}, "docdt": "2004-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
