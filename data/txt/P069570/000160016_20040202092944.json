    and Niger's January 2002 Poverty Reduction Strategy\n            Paper (PRSP) by supporting key policy measures aiming at:\n            (i) consolidating sound macroeconomic and financial\n            policies; (ii) strengthening the public expenditure\n            management reform program; and (iii) supporting the ongoing\n            implementation of key social and structural reforms. The\n            proposed operation is expected to help the implementation of\n            the poverty reduction program by: (i) fostering\n            macroeconomic and financial stability; (ii) improving\n            budgeting and public expenditure management and basic\n            service delivery (health, education, and water services);\n            and (iii) improving the environment conducive to\n            private-sector development. Four main risks could influence\n            the expected outcomes of the proposed credit: (i) domestic\n            political unrest and or external factors, including a\n            shortfall in donor support, adverse climatic conditions, and\n            social and political upheavals in neighboring countries;\n            (ii) weak institutional, managerial and administrative\n            capacity; (iii) slippages in key reforms; and (iv) growth\n            and macroeconomic scenarios may not materialize. These risks\n            are mitigated by the strength of the Government's\n            ownership and commitment to implement the proposed measures,\n            by an active policy dialogue between the Bank and the\n            Government, and by donor's efforts to provide technical\n            assistance to improve capacity-building , The project will\n            be released in two tranches."}, "docdt": "2003-09-25T00:00:00Z"}
