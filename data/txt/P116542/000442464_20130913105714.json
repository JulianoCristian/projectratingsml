The\n            transaction adviser conducted a legal analysis, which showed\n            that key features of the Societe d'Infrastructures de\n            Transmission des Communications electroniques par fibre\n            optique du Tchad (SITCOM) transaction were clearly\n            contradictory to the agreements made over the prior two\n            years between Chad, Central African Republic (CAR), and the\n            Communaute Economique et Monetaire des Etats d'Afrique\n            Centrale (CEMAC) commission and reflected in the signed\n            Financial Agreements (FAs) and Memorandum of Understanding\n            (MOU). In essence, the SITCOM transaction will have\n            jeopardized the integrity of the CAB concept of a seamless\n            regional network, specifically in terms of elements such as\n            interconnection, security, pricing, and quality of service.\n            The SITCOM transaction was incompatible with the project\n            design and the financing agreement. The existing situation\n            made it impossible to meet the effectiveness condition\n            related to the international CAB network and was contrary to\n            the MOU already signed. The team was convinced that: (i)\n            Chad will not be able to meet the effectiveness deadline for\n            the FA, which was initially set for October 10, 2012; and\n            (ii) will probably request an extension of the effectiveness date."}, "docdt": "2013-06-12T00:00:00Z"}
