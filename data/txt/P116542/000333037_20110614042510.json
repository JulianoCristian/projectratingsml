There are two components to the project,\n            the first component being connectivity. This component will\n            finance a public private partnership structure to support\n            the deployment of interconnected networks to form a regional\n            network, and additional technical assistance or support for\n            an effective management and monitoring of Central African\n            Backbone (CAB) networks. Finally, the second component is\n            the project management. This component will finance\n            management related issues at the project level. This\n            component will help to strengthen the existing project\n            implementation unit (PIU) established at national level."}, "docdt": "2011-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
