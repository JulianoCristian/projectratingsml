                         On Nov. 8, 2011, while finalizing the signing ceremony of Financing Agreement for both Chad and CAR and attending CAB1B effectiveness conditions workshop in Bangui, the
                         Government of Chad raised a number of policy and strategic issues and concerns in terms of equity participation of Chad in CAB International and in terms of financial compensation

                         from CAB International to the Government. The letter is attached to this ISR.

                         Following the questions raised by the Government of Chad, the Bank team has conducted three missions in N'Djamena (Nov. 19 – 23, Dec. 7 – 9 and Jan. 23 -28) to hold technical
                         meetings between MPTIC, SITCOM, and stakeholders to discuss the specific issues raised and with a view to seek clarifications and find a resolution to these issues.

                         On December 5, 2011, the Bank finalized and circulated to the Government an options note regarding the structuring of CAB APL1B Project. The proposed options have been
                         designed by the Bank to be compliant with the Financing Agreements (and terms of negotiations) and to take into consideration Government concerns in terms of public equity
                         participation in CAB International and in terms of financial compensation from CAB International to the Government. On March 1st, 2012 the Bank received positive responses from
                         the Government regarding the structuring options for CAB APL1B and reverted to the Government on March 12. A mission is to be undertaken in Chad (March 20 - 24) and CAR
                         (March 25 - 31) in this context to follow up on these matters.

                         The latest developments represent encouraging signs toward the signature of the negotiated FAs in both countries and to prepare and engage the CAB1B effectiveness process
                         (although a number of issues need to be clarified).

                         It is hoped that the Financing Agreements can be signed by the end of April. The two Project Teams in Chad and CAR are both focusing on meeting the effectiveness conditions.

                         During the upcoming mission the team will be assisted by the Investment bank/transaction advisor in charge of designing the PPP transaction,. The Transaction advisor has notably
                         defined the PPP structure and built country consensus on that structure. It is also organizing the selection of the Private Partner for the development, operation and maintenance of
                         the CAB International network (drafting the bidding documentation and supporting the joint technical team during the selection process)..The objectives of the mission in N’Djamena
                         and Chad are to (i) reach a final agreement on the issues raised by the Government of Chad in November 2011 at the regional level, (ii) discuss and prepare the organization of the
                         signature of the FAs, (iii) finalize memorandums of understanding (MOU) describing the roles and responsibilities of Chad and CAR in implementing the Project, (including common
                         regulatory oversight of the International CAB Company and the International CAB Network), and (iv) discuss the finalization of the tendering process and the forthcoming N’Djamena
                         regional workshop.
