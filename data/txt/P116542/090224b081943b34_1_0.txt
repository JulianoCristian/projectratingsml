                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Despite efforts made my both Governments to meet effectiveness conditions, both at the national and the regional levels, on Dec. 15, 2012, none of the two countries managed to
                         fulfill the effectiveness conditions. The effectiveness deadline for CAB1B has lapsed for both CAR and Chad, therefore both credits/grants have been canceled.
                         The Bank is committed to carrying on policy dialogue on ICT under the current effective CAB1A and to work with each country to examine and support alternative connectivity plans
                         without cross border conditionalities.
