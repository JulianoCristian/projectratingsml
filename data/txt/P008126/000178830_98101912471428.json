proposed project consists of: (i)\n            acquisition of equipment and modification of an existing\n            wharf for use as a container and bulk cargo terminal; (ii)\n            procurement of equipment and improvement of pavement and\n            sheds for general cargo operations; (iii) purchase of two\n            harbor tugs; (iv) acquisition of a bucket dredge with\n            auxiliary equipment and of a suction-hopper dredge; (v)\n            technical assistance to ANP for execution of the investments\n            included in the development program, institutional\n            strengthening and planning studies. Expected economic\n            benefits from the proposed project would consist of reduced\n            port operating and maintenance cost for ANP and ship\n            servicing and waiting times for ocean carriers. The net\n            effect of these improvements would be reductions in\n            transport costs to users: primarily to consumers of imports\n            and the producers of exports in Uruguay. The project would\n            improve Uruguay's position in foreign trade and\n            potentially contribute to the country's economic\n            recovery. There are risks inherent in ANP's\n            inexperience with the implementation of a large size port\n            development program, which may result in delays and cost\n            overruns; furthermore, the expected benefits may not be\n            derived from the project if operational changes do not occur\n            as new equipment is introduced."}, "docdt": "1979-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
