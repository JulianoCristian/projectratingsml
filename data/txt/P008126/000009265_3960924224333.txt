In the MOntVIdeo Port sd iI)  aionaliztion of Ails tariff *tctue to
educs the cost to the users whle.introducing cost-based tariffs to ensure
A' profitabiliand the   chi           t of targted wo*lng ratios.
fTe mjor componets of the project were directed at the
achievetnt of the aboe two objectives ad camprised (i) the acquisition
of equlpmnt nd marine crft partly to replace old equipmt and partly to
streWl1160 ad modernize port operations, (ii) studies and technical
assistance to Implement the project, prepare a Mater Pla  and iprove the
syst_e  of AMP, and, finaly (ILL) to reduce AMP's staff and to impro  its
on  tation. Exerience
Th objectives of the project which tooc lonr than anticipated
to uplumt (6 years Instead of 3) were partially naievd. TS  is not
to say, thatuwht vas do was not substanttl, although, clearly much
rmidsd to be don  In se*ra project ares. fTe equipNOnt purcases were
mad on the lins proposed gt apraial although the nowbers pOrcasd were
smallr tha  anticipated (para. 3.03).. The triing of equuMnt purchses
c_  about as a reudt of rwie  by the supevisio  missios ad studles
roposed In tbh  project. Sho Tecbnical Assistaea studes for
systematizing cost-accounting operatios were well ezcuted but latet and
cost accouting Was institu ted after the project vas closed with t' result
that res ructuring of tariffs had to be postponed until a follow-up Bank
project. The Master Plan Study, done In considerable depth, focussed on the
priorities for the futur developant of Mntoevideo Port. although the loua
closin  date had to be postponed for a third yer, to Decembr 1966, mstly
to *ccomozdt the completion of the Maotor Plan. Planning and Project
amplemntati1 Units vere set up In Ai? for anlysis of future plans and
for implmenting investm_nt projects (para. 5.07) bowever, these units
hav not yet becom fully operational as reponsiblities for project
implementatio were dispersed *mug AP' s mnrs, without the plani1ng
staff being fully in the pleture. t should be noted, however, that
substantl ad timely reuotioss were made Ln the staff of AMP (para.
6.05).
Restlts and Sustainability
A start ws made with the partial restreturing of tariffs at the
beginning of the project but the institution of a cost-related tariff
system dd not matera lize in the following years. ThSb coupled with
dtclining trsffic (para. 4.01) eroded AMPs financial capacity, tur=nig net
profits into net 10sses. As a result, the fiancia1 targets which depended
upon steadly inCrasing traffic ad the timly and adequate rwision of



- vi -
tariffs, Vero achieved only durtng the first few years nd the finantial
indiectors gradually deteriorated towrcd the end of the project. As a
rosult, the project's suatainability must be judged doubtful.  However,
with the completion of the costing studies the basis exists for revising
the tariff. The work of rovising the tariff structure ha started and tho
improvement of ANP's financial position will be monitored under tho naw
lank project (Transport Project I) approved by the Banks Board on February
7, 1989.
The project resulted In Important replacements and renovation of
port Installations and equipment, in technical ssistance to develop a
MAster Plan for tho port of Montevideo, and in the reorganisation of ANP's
management structure.

coastline oan the south and the east, the country is well endowed for the
export-oriented development strategy which it has been pursuing for the
last several years. The country's commercial activity and population is
concentrated in and around the capital city of Montevideo and this is
reflected in the transport system which comprises roads and a rail network
radiating out of the seaport of Montevideo (Map IBRD 1436 7R). This port
strategically located at the mouth of the La Plata River, is the country's
focal point for foreign trade, and also serves inland and coastal
navigation.
1-02     Most of the existing transport system of Uruguay is antiquated and
inadequate for its future needs. To define key development issues in the
sector, a comprehensive survey of the national transport system was.
undertaken with UNDP assistance in 1976-1979.  This survey established a
general framework for transport investment, and identified four high-
priority areass (a) strengthening of national planning; (b) improvements in
road rehabilitation and reconstruction; Cc) reductions in railroad
operations; and (d) port modernization.
B. Ports and Maritime Transport
1.03     Uruguay's foreign trade depends largely on maritime transport,
most of which is served through the port of Montevideo. This port has a
sheltered bay which was made accessible to the largest vessels and
therefore the country's inland transportation system grew around it, as did
the metropolitan city of Montevideo. Major investments in port
installations were made in the years 1905 to 1931. Thus, when the
transport sector survey was done in the seventies, the port was considered
ready for capacity adjustments and modernization to suit the changing needs
of the country.
1.04     There are four secondary ports in Uruguay located along the La
Plata and Uruguay rivers, where draft limitations range from 4.5 m to 9.0
m. These are Colonia, Nueva Palmira, Fray Bentos and Paysandu. Traffic
through these ports consists mainly of cereals and construction materials
which are exported to Argentina and Brazil. The merchant fleet of Uruguay
consists of about 30 vessels with a gross tonlage of about 280,000 tons.
Uruguay's foreign trade is handled predominantly by foreign flag line
services which call at Montevideo on their way to and from Buenos Aires.



-2-
Historically, Uruguay has always had the potential for being a major
gateway for foreign trade for the adjacent countries (Paraguay, northern
Argentina, Bolivia, southern Brazil).
C. Montevideo Port
1.05     The port of Montevideo is the deepest sheltered harbour In the
estuary of the La Plata River, and the terminal facilities adjacent to the
downtown waterfront are well protected from the open sea to the south.
Navigational access to the port from the natural 10 m depth contour in the
Atlantic South of the port entrance is via a 200 a wide straight channel
about 9 km in length. This channel originally dredged to a nominal depth
of 10 m leads to the port entrance in the main breakwater and into the
outer harbour where a large anchorage area is available. Within the inner
harbour, basins for ocean vessels were dredged to a nominal depth of 10 m
and for coastal and river traffic to 5 m.
1.06     Wharf construction at the ocean vessel berths consists of concrete
caissons with the spaces between the caissons spanned by concrete decks at
the high water line. Railroad tracks, crane rails and wharf apron paving
rest on a 2 m fill above the decks and the wharf face consists of a stone
masonry wall. There are 11 transit sheds and the total area of covered
storage is about 70,000 m2. Lifting equipment in the port consisted of.
before this project. 49 gantry cranes, a derrick of 200 ton capacity, a
floating crane of 60 ton capacity and about 50 mobile cranes almost all
purchased in the 1910s or 1930s. Floating craft operating in the port
included four dredges, 16 tugs and various miscellaneous barges and small
craft obsolete in design and uneconomical to operate.
1.07     General cargo in the port was handled predom-nantly by break-bulk
methods using dock cranes, and increasingly ships' gear in combination with
dock cranes. Very little of the cargo in the sheds was palletized. At the
time of identification of this project, about 10 million m3 of deferred
maintenance dredging was needed in the port of Montevideo to bring the
access channel and the harbour basin for ocean vessels to their original
design depth of 10 m.
D. Institutional Fremework and ANP Organization
1.08    A multitude of agencies are involved in port administration,
operation and marketing. includings MTOP through DUN and DUT; ANP; the
Ministry of Labour and Social Security, throigh the National AdmiDnistration
for Stevedore Services (ANSE); the Ministry of Economy and Finance, through
the customs, foreign trade regulations and naval industries; the Ministry
of Defense and the Navy, through the National Coast Guard (PNN), and the
Ministry of Agriculture, through the National Institute of Fishing (INAPE).
Although, in general a case exists for the participation of all these
agencies in the port subsector, the areas of authority for each need to be
clearly defined. ANP which is an autonomous state enterprise responsible
for the administration of the ports, has an obsolete organizational
structure, is overstaffed, and is not particularly well-geared to a
commercially oriented operation. Moreover, although nominally autonomous,
ANP's decision-making has been undermined by intervention in its day to day
operation by its Board of Directors. ANP also suffers from weak in-house
capacity for investment planning and pluriannual budgeting, and its
financial planning and its accounting systems have been in need of



-3-
upgrading. This work was initiated In the Montevideo Port Project and is
to be followed up in a more substantalo way In the Transport Sector Project
now und.ay.
S. PROJECT PREPARATION. APPRAISAL AD NEGOSIATIONS
2.01     A Rot mislon sent In 1977 Identified the need for a lank-
financed ptujact but found the Administracin Nac lonal de Puerto* (AMP) not
particularly Interested In or perceptive of the need for external help. A
letter was therefore sent from the Bank to the Minister for Transport
(October 1977) expressing Bank interest in a port project almed at
modernising the port operations and studies to improve the organization,
management and analysis of iuvestments, and asking for official indication
of interest by the Government of Uruguay. The Government of Uruguay
expressed interest in such a project and the Bank felt encouraged to mount
a full transport Lsesion in October-November of that year with a port
engineer to assess the needs of the port. In March 1978 the Minister for
Economy and Finance confirmed the Government of Uruguay's request for a
lank-financed project indicating, however, that this was subject to the
condition that no technical assistance would be Imposed by the World Bank.
This reluctance arose from ANP's unsuccessful experiences with other
lenders in this regard.
2.02    A port preparation mlssion was sent to Uruguay in April 1978.
Upon return of this mission the first Project Brief was prepared for the
Montevideo Port Project delineating US$74 million as the estimated cost of
the project. The mission noted that the port had ample capacity and that
its financial condition was good, but highlighted the following areas of
concerns
(a) improvement of port efficiency;
(b) Improvement of cargo-handling facilities; and
(c) rationalization of the tariff structure to reduce costs to the
port users.
2.03     The next preparation mission from the bank in September 1978
concluded that ANP did not have enough technical staff to prepare the
project by the proposed appraisal date in November-December 1978 and that
tecbnical assistauce was required over a period of several months to
prepare the project. It was proposed that UNDP could provide 50 of the
cost of this study which was expected to cost US$150,000 and that the other
50 would be provided by the Government of Uruguay. The Bank mould act as
the Executing Agency for the UNDP. There were three more preparation
missions during which AN?P's opposition to and the Bank's insistence on
technical assistance appeared to run as a continuous thread. In these
missions the terms of reference for technical assistance were hanmmered out
and the consultants put to work on the preparation of the project, with a
substantial amount of help from Bank missions.
2.04    Appraisal of the Montevideo Port Project was done during the
period May 15 to June 1. 1979. The Issues Paper described a project
comprising principally of equipment purchases (bridge cranes and cargo
hantdling equipment), marine craft (tugs and dredgers), and technical



-4-
assistance for ANP to help in project Implementation. The main issues
highlighted weres (i) the form and content of the technical assistance;
(ii) the reform of the tariff structures (ii) the timing for the
completion of engineering for the civil works; (iv) the extent of dredger
acquisition, and finally; (v) the scope and content of ANP's five year
development program.
2.05     The Decision Neeting, held on June 26, 1979, largely accepted the
overall approach of the appraisal mission to the project and its main
recommendations. In regard to the technical assistance it was agreed that
such assistance as required would be provided for the Planning and
Investment Departments, the Finance and Accounting Department and for
specialized personnel to handle the necessary engineering and procurement
for the project. In deference to ANP's hostility to the concept of
technical assistance it qas agreed that such help would be provided through
a few contracts with specialized firms and that some of the individual
advisers vould work within the ANP organization. In regard to tariffs, it
was felt at that time that ANP had sufficient cost information to
progressively introduce cost-based tariffs, and to set financial working
ratio targets at levels permitting sufficient profits for ANP to finance a
reasonable share of investments. Under this arrangement. the abolition of
"ad-valorem" tariffs and 'exemptions' would be enforced.
2.06     The recommendation of the Issues Paper that substantial completion
of detailed engineering would not be required before Board presentation was
approved, on the basis that civil works represented only about 102 of
project costs, and the resultant uncertainty in costs, however minor, would
be covered in the sensitivity analysis, and by providing larger physical
contingencies. The overall scope and content of the investment program
were considered appropriate including the acquisition of a dredger and two
tugs, and a US$30 million loan to cover financing of the full foreign
exchange component of the project cost was endorsed.
2.07     Loan negotiations were held between November 5 and 16, 1979.
During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government on the
following:
(a) allowing selective salary increases for ANP;
(b)  allowing ANP to continue staff reductions;
(c) allowing ANP to adjust tariffs as required to meet its finncial
objectives, and to discontinue the practice of allowing
'exemptionse from port tariffs; and
(d) authorizing ANP to carry out all procurement related to the
project.
Furthermore, agreement was reached with ANP, inter alia, on the followings
(i) scope and content of the 1978-1982 Development Program;
(ii) technical studies for costing, the raising of tariffs to cover at
least marginal costs, and for periodic adjustment of tariffs to
meet financial targets;



(1U)  timing of the retirement of old dredgers amewd  by AMPt
(Iv)  timing and nature of organizational cbanga a*nd goals for staff
reductions;
Cv) method  and procedurea satisfactory to the Bank for engineering
preparation and supervision of construction and equipment
manufacture and for long-terz port planning8
(vi)  preparation of a detailed analysis of container and bulk cargo
operations wlthin the new terninal complex at Muelle de Escala;
ad
(vii) development of the tug replacement program.
2.06     As conditions of effectiveness it was agreed that AMP  ould
discontinue the practice of *exemptions", implement the new port tariff
system and that the Government vould issue a decree granting approval of
all procurement related to the project. A loan of US$50 million equivalent
based on the revised cost estimates for the project was recommended to the
Board to cover 983 of the foreign exchange costs of the project detailed

2.09     Board approval of the loan of US$50 million was given on January
22, 1980. and the loan agreement was signed on March 6, 1980. The loan
becm effective an February 26, 1981, with a closing date of Decembr 31.
1983 which was eventually etended to Deceber 31, 1986.
Il. PROJECT ILEMENTATION AND COSTS
5.01    Implementation of the project had a slao  start, and supervision
missions In 1980. 1981 and 1982 noted that in addition to the delays in
signing of the Loan Agreement, nd the loan becoming effective, the
mobilixtimo of consultants, Fir pactions and disbursements were
badly delayed. Up to the end of September 1982, almost 19 months after
loan effectiveness, there had been no disbursements. By the end of 1983
only US$3.2 mlllion were disbursed and thereafter US$16.9 million in 1984,
US$9.9 million in 1985 and US$1.5 mLIlion in 1986. After closure of the
loan in December 1986 the Bank agreed to continue disbursements for those
items already contracted and the last payments were made in November 1987
when the balance US$3.18 million of the reduced amount of the loan of
US$37.0 million was cancelled. A comparison of the actual disbursements
with the disbursement schedule agreed at appraisal is given in Table 1.
Although the rate of disbursements bears no comparison with the appraisal
forecasts, it approximates more closely to the standard profile for
Uruguay, which suggests that the pr6ject timimg was over-optimistic,
particularly taking Into consideration the fact that this was ANP's first
project with the Bank. Also. the reduction of the loan amount from US$50
million to US$40 million and eventually to US$33.8 million indicates that
the project was somewhat over-dlmensioned at appraisal and needed to be
substantially pruned during the course of implementation.
3.02     As evident from the details of the project given in para. 2.08
above, the project, as appraised, was largely equipment oriented, with the
major portion of the loan US$40.1 million out of US$50 million designated
for the acquisition of cargo and terminal handling equipment (257) and
marine craft comprising tugs and dredging equipment (75Z). *A asount-of
approximately US$2.0 million was set aside for civil works, US$2.0 million
for consulting services and technical assistance, and US$5.9 million to
cover physical and price contingencies. As the implementation of the
project proiressed and the needs of ANP were more precisely defined the
loan amount was first reduced to US$40.0 million, then US$37.0 million and
finally when it was closed, to US$33.8 million.
3.03     The reduction in the loan amount corresponded approximately to
reductions in the project costs from the original total of US$58.18 million
to US$35.8 million and the foreign exchange element from the original
US$51.17 million to US$33.8 million. The comparison of what the Bank loan
was expected to finsace at Appraisal time to what it actually financed is
given in Table 2, and is suumarized below:

3.04      Chmages In civil works  arose mainly out of reduction in the scope
of the works connected vith the Muelle de hcala, to bring it In line with
the reduced purchases of bridge cranes (two to one) and some reductions In
tbo structural alterations to the sheds and the paving. Reductions in the
equipment financing were caused firstly by the reduction in the number of
bridge cranes but more Importantly by the elimination of the 2400 BP tug
and the grab-bucket dredger and the accompanying tug. The purchase of the
4000 BP tug and the 3000 m3 capacity dredger was done as originally planned
and most of the cargo handling equipment tractors, fork-lift trucks, etc.
were purchased, with some alterations, more or less as originally planned.
3.05      Technical Assistance was procured as forseen at appraisal, and
proved to be indeed an important and effective part of the project. The
studies to be conducted were generally well conceived. The terms of
reference were defined in full consultation with the Bank, and the
execution of the studies was carefully monitored, both by the Bank and by
the Borrower whose representatives participated in the work done by the
consultants. Consequently, the training aspect of the studies was
significant, as also their contribution to the refinement of the project
and the planning for the future. Only the restructuring of ANP's tariffs
based on the new costing system failed to be implemented under the project
and was postponed until a new follow-up Bank project (Transport Project I).
Broadly speaking, the consultants' work can be divided into two categories:
(a) Work related to the definition and implementation of the project;
and
(b)   Studies for the improvement of systems in the ANP, and the future
development of the port.
3.06      Under the first category fall the consultants' study for the
improvement of the container and bulk handling terminal and the study for
the definition of the marine equipment required. The former helped reduce
substantially the cost of the works in the Muelle de Escala and the
separation of the container and bulk-handling terminals whereas the latter
led to a significant pruning of the requirements of tugs and dredgers.
Prominent in the second category were the three studies for the  improvement
of the Accounting, Budgeting and Financial systems, the work for the study
of the subsoil in the Montevideo Port area and above all the Master Plan
Study for development of the Montevideo Port.  The consultants' work for
the financial and Accounting Systems was excellently done and has formed a
sound basis for providing reliable cost data for restructuring and
reorganizing the tariff system, a task to be carried out under the
Transport Project I. The sub-soil and Master Plan studies have provided
important directions for the dredging and future development works ixi the
Mbotevideo port area. an initial phase of which is also covered under the
Transport Project I. These studies also focus on the priorities in the
long term plans for the improvement of port operations.
3.07      Performance in the developmeat of the Planning Office of ANP as
such was indifferent and not everything that was to be done by way of
recruitment of the qualified staff required was done, although the process
of implementing this project and the consultants' help in the refinement of
project needs did lead to the formation of a project implementation unit.



-8.-
This unit coordinated project implementation, and despite the delays that
occured (paras. 3 08 to 3 10 below) kept track of the work done and the
tasks that rem mined undone or inadequately completed. Some of this
remining work is being taken up under the Transport I project.
Project Costs and TSilna
3.08      Analysis of project costs was made more difficult not only by the
relatively high inflation rates but also because the parity between the
dollar and the Uruguayan peso was rather unevenly maintained during the
project years. A comparison between Appraisal estimates and actual costs
is given in Table 3 and the actual completion dates for each project item
in relation to the Appraisal forecast dates is given in Table 4. An
analysis of Tables 3 and 4 illustrates that the main features of the
project  implementation were as follows:
(a) the project was actually completed in 1986 instead of 1983;
(b)   project implementation delays occurred mainly due to delays in
mobilization of consultants and procurement delays arising from
system delays (para. 3.08 to 3.10 below);
(c)   the actual cost of the Project at US$35.8 million was
substantially (38Z) lower than the Appraisal estimate of US$58.2
million. This occurred primarily due to refinements in the
project as a result of post-appraisal studies;
Cd)   Major reductions occurred in the procurement of port equipment
and marine craft which at about US$31.7 million was about 35S
lower than the original estimate of about $48.8 million;
(e) The reductions in civil works although important in terms of
percentage (78Z), involved a smaller amount (US$5.3 million) as
the original estimate at US$6.8 million was relatively small; and
(f) the technical assistance and consultancy tasks were adequately
addressed. somewhat over (2?) the original cost estimates.
Procurement
3.09      This is a project in which problems related to procurement were
perhaps the predominant cause of delay. To begin with, it is apparent,
with the benefit of hind-sight, that the project as originally conceived,
was overdimensioned, as attested by the significant reductions in the
equipment and marine craft purchases, leading eventually to a sizeable
reduction of ths loan amount, by over 302. The forecast of dredging work
required was excessive, which resulted in an overestimation of the dredger
requirements. Only one of the two dredgers proposed was purchased, and
even this, after the arrears of dredging work were taken care of, is
reported to have surplus capacity. Similarly, only one of the two tugs
proposed at appraisal was procured. The consultants' work in refining the
requirements of marine craft and the bank supervision missions' oncern for
the avoidance of unnecessary investments were undoubtedly responsible for
the reductions, but there was, inevitably, a cost in terms of time for the
rather s'.gnificant pruning operation.



9-_
3.10      Secondly, a whole series of delays in procurement occured due to
what can best be described as system delays, which were exacerbated, at
least in part, due to ANP's lack of familiarity with International bidding
procedures. In the procurement of the container crane for instance the
Bank did tot agree with ANP's award recommendtion, which resulted In
protracted correspondence between the borrower and the Bank. Eventually,
the Bank's view prevailed, but much time and effort was lost in arriving at
the appropriate decision for the bid-award. Then there was the problem
caused by the practice of simpugnaciones' by which contending bidders can
bring forth claims of unfairness against the purchaser. More often than
not these protests delay and paralyse procurement proceedings till such
time as the claims have been cleared by the highest levels of the
Goverument's 'Tribunal de Cuentasc. This is really a delay for which the
system is responsible, and one which is often exploited by unsuccessful
bidders to the detriment of project timing. Aother problem that arises
with 'impuguacioanes is the right the system confers on the bidders to
examine the bid evaluations, a practice that in a sense runs contrary to
the confidentiality of the bid evaluation process under ICB procedures. 1
Be that as it may, 'impugnaciones' contributed substantially to the project
implementation delays in the Montevideo Port Project.
3.11      Finally, the project had its share of delays for which only the
borrower can be held accountable. These included more than one tender for
which ANP recommended the tender 'Concursos' to be Oanulled%, sometimes for
dubious reasons, when it was perceived by ANP (not always correctly) that
the bids did not suit the requirements of ANP. In the case of the rather
substantial study for the Master Plan, for instance, the Bank did not see
eye to eye with ANP an the vecommendation for award, as the various offers
were not correctly evaluated. However AMP was reluctant to agree with
this, and a protracted controversy ensued. Finally, when the Bank's
position was accepted, ANP recommended the postponemeat of the study
whereby a few months later fresh bids were called and the contract awarded
to a party better suited to the important task. On the positive side, it
has to be said that this was the Bank's first operation with ANP, and
although serious delays occurred in project implementation, the give and
take of the procurement process definitely helped ANP to understand ICB
procedures better.
Proiect Financing
3.12      Table 7 sets out the actual financing of the project by source.
No major difficulties were encountered in the financing of project costs,
specially since 942 of the actual funds required were provided by the Bank
loan.
11 This is a matter that will sooner or later have to be addressed by the
Bank in relation to the implementation of ICB procedures, because ICB
rules discourage the type of practices implied in 'impupiaciones' which
are now well known to cause serious delays in procurement actions in
countries like Argentina and Uruguay.

IV. RAFC AND OPRATIONS
4.01     Over 901 of Uruguay's foreign trade is maritime, and about 702 of
this trade is handled through Montevideo port. At appraisal, port traffic
vas expected to grw from 1.5 million tons in 1978 to 2.7 million tons in
1990. However, the actual Increases fell far short of the projectod
increasoe. Table 5 gives a comparison of the actual traffic over the
project years with tbh traffic forecast at appraisal. This comparison is
sumarized below:

11 These figures are taken from the "Best Estimate' in tables 2.3 and 2.4
of the Appraisal Report.
21 Actual figures have been obtained from ANP.
4.02     The figures of the actual traffic above indicate fluctuations
vithin a range defined by a high around 1,500,000 tons in 1978, 1981 and
1988, and a depressing low of 971,000 tons In 1982 almost at about 54S of
the estimated traffic for the year. Various reasons have been given for
the poor traffic performance and certainly the severe recession in the
country and particularly the world depression In and around the year 1982
played their role. As a result the projected increases in the export of
rice, meat and general cargo did not materialize, neither did the imports
of wheat, primary materials, fuels and lubricants grow as forecast. This
leads one t- the rather obvious conclusion that traffic forecast for the
project period were over - optimistic. Over the past five years however,
traffic has been increasing slowly and steadily, and in particular in 1988
there has beem a substantial increase in keeping with the upswing in
economic activity in Uruguay.
4.03     The equipment purchases, primarily the acquisition of the
container crane did encourage the growth of container traffic, which have
exceeded appraisal expectations (see table 6)   The works in the Huelle de
Escala, the acquisition of port handling equipment and the introduction of
pallets and fork lift trucks, mobile cranes, a tug and dredger did help to
streamline port operations and arrears of dredging work in the port were
cleared. However, the decline of traffic limited the improvement of
operations as, to some extent, the improvement of operations is contingent,
ter ala, upon a healthy growth of traffic which in this case was not
realised. It is not surprising therefore that the follow-up transport
sector project picked up the productivity of Montevideo port as an area in
which improvement could be brought about not only in cargo handling and
gang productivity, but also in the waiting time of ships alongside berths



a 11 -
In Montevideo port. To somo extent low productivity In Montevideo port is
the result of 'iadequate coordinAtion between stevedoring and on-shore
cargo handling on the ane hand, and lack of incentives for Improving
workers efficiency and skills on the other. This and other related issues
including equlpment maintenance have been analysed as part of the port
component of the Transport Project I and various steps have been outlined
to bring about improvements in the operations of Montevideo port.
V. FINANCIAL PRFOIMANCE
Financial Results
5.01     Although ANP had remained a highly profitable institution  during
the second-half of the 1970's, it was experiencing a gradual decline in
operating revenues because of increasing esemptions being granted by the
Government. In order to prevent a further deterioration in the entity's
financial capacity, the Bank and the Government agreed that the following
actions would be undertaken during project processing and implementation:
(i) AMP would revise its tariff structure based on the cost of services
rendered in order to reduce cost to users while ensuring cost recovery (a
full discussion is provided in paras. 5.05 through 5.08 below); and (ii)
ANP would achieve a 26? staff reduction in 4 years (by end 1083).
5.02     A comparison of ANP's actual and forecast financial results
(Income Statements and Balance Sheets) in current USS terms is presented in
Tables 8 and 9. Although actual figures generally reflect the evolution of
AMP's finances, the comparison of actual with forecast data is complicated
by the currency in which projections were originally made. At appraisal,
projections were denominated in current US$ terms in order to avoid
distortions arising from local inflation. Difficulties arise, however. in
expressing actual data in USS terms because of the wide fluctuations
experienced by the real exchange rate as a consequence of the exchange rate
policy followed by the Government during the project period. Therefore,
for purposes of evaluation. ANP's financial statements in constant 1988
Uruguayan pesos covering 1982-1986, have also been attached to this report
as Tables 10 and 11.
5.03     Contrary to appraisal expectations, ANP's financial results
deteriorated sharply during the project period, the main reasons beings: (i)
declining traffic, particularly the high revenue-earning mport traffic
(paras 4.01 and 4.02); (ii) failure to institute a systematic tariff
adjusting system to ensure cost recovery of port operations; and (iii) high
interest costs arising from the entity's increasing indebtedness (para
5.04). As a consequence, ANP's working and operating ratios deteriorated
from 72 and 89 in 1982 to 93 and 109 respectively in 1986. Furthermore, by
end-1984 ANP was already experiencing net losses. It is noteworthy that by
end-1982, ANP had reduced its staff levels beyond appraisal targets. The
corresponding cost reductions, however, were insufficient to make up for
the reduction in revenues.
5.04     Because of its satisfactory financial performance during the
1970s, ANP had accumulated a cash surplus of about US$50 million by the



- 12-
early 1980C.   oeve"r, since tho Covemnt  s  ea perincing serious
cooMIc ad fiancial difficUlties at the time, It instrueted ANP, In
1983, to transfer US$22 Million of its surplus to the Treasury. In
addition, AMP vas required to finance 0S of the construction of the
container terminal and tes fishin  berths,  ounting to US$10 million,
which the Goverinnt had intially agreed to finance but failed to do.
These two important cash outflows, coupled with the deterioration in AMP s
financial results aggravated APM's cash position substantially, and from
1984 onwards, total AMP revenues were insufficient to cover cash deficits.
Consequently, AMP had to resort to short end long-term loans to cover its
financing gap.
Port Tariffs
5.05     At the tim  of appraisal, ANP's tariff system suffered from a
number of dlsparities import end esport cargo tariffs were quoted on an
ad-valorem basis, bearing no relationhip to costs; Import charges were
substantially higher than those applied to exportas at lmporters' request
an increasing portion of traffic handled was being exempted from port
charges by the Government, with total exemptions reaching an amount
equivalent to 232 of total revenues in 1978s and, ship charges were
substantially underpriced In order to encourage vessels to and from Buenos
Aires to call at Montevideo port.
5.06     In order to reduce these distortions, the Government issued a
decree in 1979 requiring the institution of cost-based tariffs by AMP.
Further, and backing the Government's initiative, the Bank established that
such a tariff system rs well as the discontinuance of exemptions would be
conditions of loan effectiveness. However, ANP's reluctance to completely
eliminate ad-valorem charges until reliable cost data was available led to
considerable delays in loan effectiveness. Finally, in early 1981. in
order not to delay further project execution, the Bank agreed to waive this
condition for effectiveness on the understanding that the tariff revisions
would be carried out in two stages: (i) AMP would imediately reduce ad-
valorem charges on imports, Increase charges on exports and on vessels, and
eliminate exemptions; and (ii) one year later (early 1982), ANP would
establish a new cost-based tariff system, satisfactory to the Government
and the Bank, once cost accounting systems had been adequately developed by
the consultants.
5.07     However, ANP's general reluctance to employ management consultants
i- view of bad past experiences, led to considerable delays in the
development of the new costing system, and it was not until September,
1984, that a contract was signed with the consultants. Although the
studies were agreed to be carried out within an 18-month period, the new
costing system became fully implemented only by end-1988, more than four
years after contract signing. Further, the revision of tariffs based on
the new costing system did not materialize under the project, but an action
plan for the establishment of such tariffs was included under the new Bank
project (Transport Project I) approved by the Bank's board of Executive
Directors on February 7, 1989.
S.08     Although the task of rationalizing tariffs was only partially
accomplished, the project proved successful in that the new costing system
laid a sound basis upon which a systematic tariff adjustment mechanism is
planned to be developed under the new project. It is also noteworthy that
through this exercise ANP regained confidence in the use of management



_ 13 -
consultants whsnever in-house expertise is not available. However, had the
Bank and the Government exercised more presure upon ANP, cost-related
tariffs could perhaps have been introduced years earlier preventing, to an
Important extent, the deterioration of ANP's finances (para 5.03).
VI. INSTITUUAONL PRFOEUWCEAND DEVELOPFENT
6.01     AMP was created by Law In 1916, and charged vith the
responsibility for all aspects of comercial port operations in Uruguay.
The institution was governed by a three member Board of Directors named by
the Goverrment which designated two of its members as the President and the
Vice President. The President has the responsibility for the policy
direction and the decision making with some of the less important duties
assigned to the Vice President. At present. the Board consists of five
members, three of  hom ar* appointed by their political parties.  The basic
structure of the organization had changed little since its inception and
the day-to-day affairs of the port were managed by four key managers in
charge of Finance, Administration, Technical affairs and Port Operations.
Another significant factor at the time of appraisal was that the President
and the Vice President of ANP were retired officers from the armed services
and were appointed by the military Government. There bad therefore been
some improvement in the discipline in port administration but the military
authorities tended to be rigid in management style and often resistant to
the delegation of authority and to changes in systems. Port operations
were 'Intervened' by the military which dislocated the normal channel of
command and introduced an element of unpredictability in important
decisions.
6.02     The appraisal mission, considering the rather obsolete structure
of the management organization generally not well-suited to a commercial
operation and the overstaffing in rank and file, recommended and the
Uruguayan authorities agreed upon the following changes as part of the
Bank-financed project for ANP:
(i)   appointment of a General Manager to be responsible for the day
to day management of ANP, leaving the President and Vice
President to devote more time to policy-related issues;
(ii)  creation of a Planning Unit responsible for the planning of the
Port and the related institutional and financial matters;
(iii) creation of a Project Implementation Unit for the supervision
and control of ANP's investment projects; and .
(iv) a general streamlining of the institution by the achievement of
agreed targets for staff reductions, and selective salary
increases.
6.03     The staff reduction targets were successfully met and although
some increases In staff took place after the initial reductions, the
overall staff of ANP was reduced from 6300 to the targeted 4500. Further



_ 14 -
reductions of staff are possible and this question is being addressed in
the foUow up Trasport Project 1. Considerable tim  and effort was *lso
spent upon wock for the selective Increases of salaries, whereby salary
levlel related to certain key posts were raised to attract and retain move
competent staff. A project l emlentation unit was set up although with
some delay. The Planning Ut vas established as proposed vithin the
organizational structure of ANP, but vithout the full complement of staff
foreen. Iowsver thit unit did participate with the Consultants in the
Master Plan study. Further work on the consolidation of the plrnning unit
howevr. goes on under the follaw-up Transport Project I.
6 04    Notwithstanding the fact that the accomplishment in the area of
Institutional development was s*omhat short of the project expectations,
an important begining was made. and the groundwork laid for the
transformation of ANP into a leaner, stronger organization.
VII. ECONOMC R-EVALUATION
7 01    The general methodology for the economic re-evaluation and the
specific methodologies for the sub-projects are basically the same as the
ones used at appraisal. There are three groups of investment which were
financed under the Loans li) container and general cargo handling
equipmnt, together with some associated infrastructure; (ii) tugs; and
(iii) dredging equipment. Although the composition of these sub-groups
changed during implementation from that which formed the basis of the
economic evaluation at appraisal, and the overall investment costs were
reduced, the broad groupings and their intrinsic economic rationale were
not substantially altered. The underlying sources of economic benefits,
and the way in which the values were implicitly altered during the course
of implementation of the project, are detailed for each of the three groups.
In the following paragraphs.
7.02    Container and General CarRo Eauipment
The SAR forecast an increase in total traffic from 1.5 million
tons (1978) to 2.3 million tons (1987) and 2.7 million tons (1990). In
fact traffic declined, then recovered, and in 1987 totalled 1.3 million
tons. Of this, 124,000 tons were containerized (about 9.5Z) the same
proportion as was forecast. The average tonnage per ship was less than
epected, at 730 tons against 1,065 tons. This has Implications, for
dredging, but probably was not a significant factor in regard to ship
handling operations. In reassessing the benefits, the assumption is
therefore made that the ship service and cargo handling tin/inputs
required in the absence of the project would have been proportional to the
traffic volumes i.e. instead of increasing by 50Z in 1978-87 these would
have actually declined, or at best remained stable. This is important as
the projected benefits from avoidance of delays to ships constituted a
major part of total benefits from this set of ivestments and were
projected to increase sharply with increased berth occupancy, in accordanes
with the Erlang queuing model employed. The revised assumption is made
that the berth occupancy expected In 1983, obtains, on average, over the
project forecast period. The investment costs of this component group have
also been reduced fron appraisal forecasts, due to substantial reduction of
the civil works, a reduction from two to one bridge cranes, and a reduced



-15-
amount of cargo handlig equipment, the reducion being frao $13.9 Million
to $8.2 miion.  The revised EU on this assumptio  works out at about
21?.
7.03     Tu
The projoct origially included two tugs, one of 2400 hp uad the
the other of 4,000 hp. Whereas the maller tug was neded for operations
in the sheltered harbour, the larger tug was designed for seagoing
operations ze1luding the important but not easily quantifiable benefits of
(a) emergency service at the offshore tanker facilty at Ponta Jose Ignacio
and (b) provision of capability for assisting vessels In distress outside
the port of Montevideo. Is any event, only one tug, of 4,000 hp was
purchased, complete with the additional capablities for seagoing
operat4ons. The main non-environmental benefits were expected from reduced
ship delay time and reduced tug operating costs, resulting particularly
from retirement of an old tug with high maintenance costs. From the
available data it is clear that their translation lAto benefits streams
would be affected by traffic failing to increase as forecast. Furthermore,
although the number of tugs was reduced to one, the cost reduction at 128
was less than proportional. By contrast, traffic levels reached only about
half the forecast levels over the project period. The original EUR was
expected to be 14S for a 2,400 hp tug. If the actual cost and benefit
reductions are assumed, the EM declines to 8-92. If, however, the
unquantifiable benefits of the emergency and rescue capabilities of the
4,000 hp tug are taken into consideration, the ERR could improve to perhaps
13-142 . For working out the overall ERR on the project (table 12) an ERR
of 92 has been taken for this subproject.
7.04     Dredgers
The proposed procurement of the two dredgers at almost 50 of the
total cost of the project was a major component of the project. The
rationale was (i) the need to retire the old dredgers and to eliminate a
backlog of dredging which was estimated to have reached over 11 million m3
by early 1979: (ii) to remove the annual volume of siltation (over 3
million =3); and (iii) to deepen the access channel (nearly 2 million mn
plus annual siltation of 0.3 million mz). Apart from the fact that the
dredging requirements were overestimated, it seems clear from the SAR data
that only on very conservative assumptions regarding productivity could the
purchase of two dredgers be justified. It is also equally clear that the
smaller dredger by itself vould not add sufficient capacity to eliminate
the backlog reasonably quickly. As a matter of fact review of dredging
requirements by the supervision missions and the coasultants resulted in
reduction of the purchase program. The procurement of the grab bucket
dredger vas cancelled but the suction type dredger of 3,000 m3 capacity was
purchased together with three barges. The ER is, accordingly,
recalculated on the bases thats Ci) the reduction in the dredging equipment
investment resulted from elimination of the smller dredger; (ii) the
capacity of the dredger procured, although well suited to the expeditions
clearance of arrears of dredging, was still somewhat in excess of the
regular requiremeats of AhP and (iii) between the two sizes of dredgers,
the capital cost would increase at 0.43 times the increase In capacity
(capacity increases by 2,300 m3, price Increases by 1002); (iv) benefits
per m3 were as forecast. These considerations actually lead one to the



- 16 -
conclusion that the ideal investment in dredgers should perhaps ha". been
about 501 of the projected cost instead of 66S as actually happened. On
this basis the ERR for dredgers works out to 182.
7.05     The overall ERR on the project works out to 161 instead of 241
forecast at appraisal. A statement of estimated and revised ERR for each
ubproject and the overall ERR for the complete project is given in Table
129
VIII. THE ROLE OF THE BUNR
8.01     It appears from this review, that although much remains to be done
in the port subsector, the Bank's contribution in its first port project in
Uruguay was a positive one. The Bank's analysis of the port situation was a
useful one that helped focus on the need for equipmttt renewal, system and
organizational improvements and the rationalization of the tariff
structure. The equipment acquisition program as originally appraised was
overdimensioned, and with the benefit of hindsight the traffic forecasts
appear to have been overoptimistic. However, the improvement of costing
systems, the staff reductions, the creation of the planning and project
implementation units, the sub-soil and Master Plan studies, all done on the
Instigation of the Bank, were positive aspects of the project which enabled
ANP to update its equipment and systems, provided ANP with improved
capability for cost analysis, some semblance of corporate planning and
better control ov#r investments in the future.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01     The project was initially overdimensioned mainly because of
overoptimistic demand forecasts. However it proved fairly successful both
in regard to its timing and its general design. Port installations and
equipmen were getting old and obsolete and needed replacement. The
project helped identify the replacements needed and, by building in
technical assistance to undertake a rigorous review of the investments
required, achieved the task at 621 of the costs originally estimated,
albeit with substantial delays. More importantly, ANP was persuaded of the
need for technical assistance which helped initiate improvement of AMP's
systems and organization and helped formulate the Master Plan for the
future development of ANP.
9.02     Project execution was substantially delayed mainly because of slow
bureaucratic procedures which first caused a late start and subsequently
led to inordinate delays in procurement actions and the engagement of
consultants. The fact that the military governed the country for the
greater part of the project period also contributed to the slow progress in
as much as there was a certain rigidity in the management style and an
unwillingness to submit to the discipline imposed by the conditionality of
the project. As a matter of fact serious action on the financial and
tariff covenants did not start till the Government changed and the
democratic regime came to power.
