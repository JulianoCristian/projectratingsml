The principal objectives of the project were to\n            improve the health status and quality of health services.\n            Specifically, the project was designed to: (i) support the\n            upgrading and extension of primary health care (PHC) in the\n            governorates of Shabwa, Al Mahra and the island districts of\n            Socrota and Perim; (ii) develop and upgrade health manpower\n            in these areas; (iii) promote family planning and health\n            education throughout the country; and (iv) strengthen the\n            management capabilities of Ministry of Public Health (MOPH)\n            staff and support decentralization of MOPH's\n            administration. Bank's performance was satisfactory.\n            Borrower's performance was satisfactory. The key\n            lessons learned were as follows: (i) the current fiscal\n            constraints and lack of resources allocated to lower level\n            health services limit the government's ability to\n            support the provision of PHC services where alternative\n            cost-effective strategies are needed; (ii) there is a\n            minimum package of inputs required for the effective\n            delivery of health services which must be operational for\n            implementation of health programs to be successful; (iii)\n            women are more likely to seek care if a female health worker\n            is available so their participation as health providers\n            should be encouraged; (iv) appropriate incentive systems is\n            critical for sustainability; (v) community participation can\n            also support sustainability and should be encouraged; (vi)\n            training programs should be located near the community to\n            encourage the participation of women; (vii) including a\n            specific mechanism for follow-up with other donors will\n            facilitate monitoring the achievement of objectives; and\n            (viii) delays in implementation hamper the achievement of\n            project objectives. Similarly, revised output indicators\n            should be formulated if there are significant implementation delays."}, "docdt": "1996-06-13T00:00:00Z"}
