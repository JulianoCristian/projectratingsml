The project\n            achieved its main objectives, its impact on institutional\n            development was significant, sustainability is likely, and\n            the performance of both the Bank and Borrower was\n            satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, although the choice of not creating an\n            autonomous project unit proved to beneficial to internalize\n            policy reform, perhaps it was a mistake not to have\n            strengthened the project management unit with outside\n            support familiar with Bank procedures. Second, for\n            critically lacking financial and administrative skills, it\n            would probably have been cost effective to provide for more\n            than the strict minimum in training. Third, the project\n            proved instrumental in strengthening urban institutions and\n            assisting the Guinean government in putting in place a\n            completely new structure for local government in less than\n            six years. Fourth, the development of more self-reliant\n            financing mechanisms for the provision of urban services\n            remains one of the critical challenges for the efficiency of\n            the sector in the future. Fifth, the project restructuring,\n            adding an employment generation objective, allowed for an\n            adjustment of the institutional arrangements to the\n            country's political and administrative changes.\n            Finally, close coordination between MUH, CECI, and UNEG\n            proved instrumental in designing an assistance program\n            responsive to the needs of small enterprises."}, "docdt": "1992-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
