carried out by competitive contracting;\n            (b) address the backlog of rehabilitation works, and (c)\n            improve road safety. The project will include: (1) road and\n            bridge rehabilitation; (2) road maintenance equipment to\n            replace obsolete equipment for functions the national roads\n            administration will continue to perform itself; (3) a road\n            safety program; and (4) technical assistance and training,\n            especially to update standards and practices for road\n            design, environmental protection, pavement technology, and\n            management systems."}, "docdt": "1992-12-03T00:00:00Z"}
