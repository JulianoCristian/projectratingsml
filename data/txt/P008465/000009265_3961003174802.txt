TO= RIEPUBIfIC OF HUNGARY
EQKRQA ESTQI
1.    I submit the following report and recommendation on a propos4 loan to the Repulibc
of Hungary for the equivalent of US$90 million, in support of a Roads Project. MTe loan
would have a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 5 years, at the standard variable
interest rate.
2. awkzrounW: Hungary has made substantial progress over recent years in
implementing market-oriented reforms in the -tran t sector. Entry to the road transport
industry has been liberaled. The prvate sector now accounts for 32% of road ton-kn,
compared with 6% in 1986, and is  ped toaccount for virtualy 100% wihin a ew
years. Road freght taiffs have been deregulated, and the level of cost recovery from road
users has inesed significantly, in accordance with a covenant under the ongoing Second
Thnsport Project (Loan 3032-HU). Subsidies to the railways and to public tnsport have
been reduced by about 30% in real terms. Intenational competitive bidding has been
introduced for major roadworks, and local competitive bidding (with the partcpation of
foreign conactors via joint ventures with commerialized former force account maintenance
units) is now used for 60% of road strengthening works.
3.    Both the commercial and private vehicle fleets have approxmatey doubled over the
past decade, and taffic on the trnk and main roads of the national system continued to grow
at an average rate of 5% per annum through the 1980s, despite the difficult macroeconomic
condifions. These conditions however have constrained road expenditures, which in recent
years have been about one-third below the level of the early 1980s. This has not only
precluded any significant modeization or augmentation of the network, but has also resuted
in a serious deterioration of the surface condition and load-baing capacity of the existg
roads and bridges. A quarter of Hungary's national roads (Jlalf of them with taffic over
1,000 vehicles per day) are rated -uneven and distressed" and another 50% are "uneven with
some distres". Government is therefore planning to increase total road exenditures by
about 60% compared with 1991, and within this total to more than double expendit  on
road and bridge rehabilitaton. These increas  would restore roads expenditure to the same
proporton of GDP as applied in the early 1980s. About 80% of proposed roads
expendites between 1993 and 1996 would be financed from road users (who also male
substantial contributions to genea revenues), and the government is mobilizing funds from
the inteaional financing agencies for the remaining 20%.

4.      Tiohs Involvemnt in the Se first Transport (Rail/Road) Project
(Lan 2557-HU, 19oS, US$ 75 million) provided assistance to railways (MAV), road
infrastructue and a pastaa trucidng company. The Loan closed in Septmber 1991, three
months behind schedule; cosu (in US $) were less than the appraisal estimate, and the
project achieved its principal objectives, although the railways' financial performance
deteriorated (due to substantial traffic losses associated with macroeconomic restructuring and
decline of trade within the former CMEA). The Second Transport Project (Lom 3032-RU,
1989, US$95 nmilion) included follow-up assstance in the same three sub-sectors covered in
the fist prect and added some limitid asisun  to the Budapest Public Transport
Company (1KV). There were some initial delays in implementation (disbursement lag 51%),
but most components are now proceeding    ily. The principal policy and
instituia accomplishments of these two projects have been: (a) major improvements in
the planning, budgedng and implementation of roads projects, particularly the intmduction of
competitive bidding into road works; (b) the partial pnivatizadon of road maintenance units (a
process which is continuing); and (c) the initiatior of a more commercial apprach to
managing the railways and urban public transport, though this is a slow process and much
more remains to be done.
5.   The main lesson from the ongoing project is that railway reform cannot be
accomplished by 'tinkering at the margin' with the existing organization, and that a
substantial restructuiing is required; the Bank is discussing with Hungarian officials a
possible new operation based on this pnnciple. Another lesson has been that the impact of
training would be increased if it is linked to specific institutional objectives, and forms part
of an integrated package with consulting services and technical asdstance. This exeience
has been drawn on in formulating the institutional component of the proposed project.
6.   Rationale for Condnued Bank         : During the preparation of the proposed
project, the Bank promoted a balanced expenditure and financing plan, which provided the
framewok for effective participation by EEB and EBRD via parallel projects. A continued
presence via the proposed project v,ill consolidate and extend the policy and institutonal
improvements noted in para. 4. There will be an increase in the proportin of road works
put out to tender, and the pavement managem nt systems and associated engieeng-
economic plaming tools will be furiher developed, and their applcation exnded. The Bank
will also bring a focus to improving certain environmental procedures, and to addressing a
mounting road safety problem.
7.   Relation to Country Assistance Stategy: The Bank's stategy for Hungary is to
support poLicies and invotMents aimed at restoring economic growth and social development
as the country proceeds with its transition to a market-oriented ecoomy. The proposed
project would support this strategy by expanding the volume of work for the privating
consuction industry, reducing transport costs, and addressing the social problem of rising
road fatalities.

8.   Priect MiOhjecd: 'The prcipal objectives of the poposed project are to (a)
enhance the efficiency of public expenditure on roads by supporting continued impovement
in management, planning and pgmmng techniques and in selected technical areas, and by
increaing the proportion of work camed out by competitive conacting; (b) address the
bacldog of reablitation works; and (c) improve road safety.
9.   Pg: The project would include (a) road and bridge rehabilitation; (b)
road maitenance equipment to replace obsolete equipment for functions the national roads
administtion will continue to perform itself; (c) a road safety program; and (d) technical
assistance and training focussed on particular institutional development objecdves.
10.  Im: MTCWM's RTD would be responsible for maging project
implemntation and will select the oramzations responsible for directly managing road and
bridge works, including the praaton of bid documents, contctor qualification and bid
evaluation in addition to normal site supervision. AU road and bridge works will be
procured through local competitive bidding procedures, as used under the ongoing project,
which are atisfctory. Most equimnent would be procured by ICB.
11. Agrod Actios: During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
OrniSmaftte:
(a) that Hungary would complete a strategic medium and long term road
maintenance plan by December 31, 1993;
0b) to increase the prportion of surfice dressing work carried out by competitively
awarded contracts to 40% by 1995;
(c)  a core road expenditure plan for 1993-96 (comprsing maintenance and
rehabiitation of roads and bridges, road safety measures and debt service);
(d) joint review of each year's total road expenditure and financing plan, in
advance, and an agreement that no major new commitment will be enterd into
which does not yield an ERR, of at least 12%;
(e) to nmaintain a system of road user taxation such that each vehicle class pays the
road costs attributable to it;
(t)  details of the 1993 road and bridge rehabilitation programs, and aangmts
for the Bank's prior reviw of each subsequent year's program; and
(g)  that as a condition for disbursing any of the loan proced for road safety,
Hungary would prepar an integrated Road Safety Program satisctory to the
Bank

12.  E viomental Cmdcn mn na: The project has a B rating. Hungay's strict
environmental reg ons will serve to mitgate any potential negative impacts, which will be
minor. Ali civil work will be within existing rights of way and involve no land acquiiton
Because the road works are predominany strengthening with only limited widening, there is
little implication for earthwork effects on slope stability and erosion, and to the etent that
this issue arises eisting procedures in Hungary are state-of-the-art Environmental
regulaions on other constructon activities are smilaly strict, and are embodied in an agreed
mitigation plan. The project will have some favorable effects. Improvements to the
condition of roads and brdges should lower vehcle emissions by reducing the need for
variatons in vehicle speed and for detours, and the road safety component aims to reduce
accidents.
13.               : The road and bridge rehabilitaton comonents, which account for
80% of project costs, will reduce vehicle operating costs and avoid the need for more
epensive subsequent reconstructiontrenewal. The maintenance equipment will replace
obsolete 20-year old equipment used in futnctions that the roads aditation will need to
contnue to prform itself, rather than contract out. The safety program will aim to reduce
Hungary's road fatalities, which have increased 80% since 1987 to a rate which is 2-4 times
that of westen Europe. The technical assistance component will improve the effeciveness
of roads adminion and expenditure, pardculrly in maintece.
14.  RWisk: The specific project risks are mindmal. Hungary has a good implementato
record under the two previous projects, and the sub-pojects are all of a smlscale (works
usually completed within a year), so there is litl risk of major impltaton delays or
cost overus. The EtRs are based on modest assumptions of traffic rowth (usually 5% per
annum), so they are not sensitive to this assumption. The fact that the final annual progam
wil be detmined at the beginning of each yea fter minimis rss, as it allows the
composiiion of the pwgamns to be adjusted to any unexpected changes in the pace of road
and bridge deion.
15.  The more substantial riscs relate to broader sector issues, specificaly that:
(a) Hungary might over-extend its road expenditure plans, as a result of a
perception that it has to undetake substantidal investment to 'catch up' to
Western Europe; and
(b)  that recent progrss in obtaining an adequate financial contribudon from road
users, especially heavy vehicle, might be undermine by resistance from the
trucking lobby to future increases that wi be necessary to offset te effects of
inflation.
The actions described in para. 11(c) to (e) are directed at minimizing these r.



16.  EMMmoaft: I am safisfied that this loan would comply with the Ardcles of
Agreement of the Bankc, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
operton.
