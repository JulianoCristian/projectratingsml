Furthermore project sustainability is\n            likely. The Bank's performance in all aspects of the\n            project cycle was satisfactory. Borrower performance was\n            also satisfactory generally, although it did not meet all of\n            the financing requirements and did not comply with all of\n            the loan covenants. Two lessons emerged from the project\n            experience: First, there is a tendency for the Government to\n            use the road budgets to expand the road network, whereas\n            there are few incentives for allocating adequate resources\n            for maintenance although the economic rates of return for\n            maintenance operations are usually quite high. Maintenance\n            activities need to be given higher priority by the\n            Government if the road networks are to be sustained and\n            overall transport costs reduced. This could be done by\n            greater efforts to educate the road users, the public at\n            large, and the Government's financial and technical\n            managers on the need for an appropriate level of road\n            maintenance financing and the consequent savings that would\n            accrue. Second, it is possible to achieve a significant\n            reduction in road accidents through a coordinated road\n            safety program."}, "docdt": "1999-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
