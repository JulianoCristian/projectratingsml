                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the project is to increase the demand for and competitive supply of energy efficient goods and services, contributing to : (a)
                         increased efficiency of energy use; (b) reduced reliance of the Uruguayan economy on imported energy and fuels; and (c) reduced emission from the energy
                         sector.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is implementing a series of activities to tackle Energy Efficiency from different angles (regulation, awareness, strengthening the supply side, direct investments in energy
                         efficiency). As a result, energy efficiency is playing an important role in the public agenda. An Energy Efficiency Law was approved in September 2009 to ensure the continuity of the
                         program. The Energy Efficiency Fund is already in place and Commercial Banks are offering the Energy Efficiency guarantees for energy efficiency investments and contingent lines
