reduced emission from the energy sector.\n            The purpose of this project restructuring is to: 1)\n            incorporates the Uruguay Guarantee Trust Fund for Energy\n            Efficiency (UFEE) to a national system of guarantees (SiGa);\n            2) reallocate the grant proceeds; and 3) to convert the\n            technical assistance Sub-loans currently financed under the\n            project into technical assistance sub grants. The\n            restructuring is justified, based on the results the project\n            has achieved to date and on the project's potential to\n            meet its development objectives."}, "docdt": "2011-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
