Uruguay is to increase the demand for and\n            competitive supply of energy efficiency (EE) goods and\n            services, contributing to: (a) improved efficiency of energy\n            use; (b) reduced reliance of the Uruguayan economy on\n            imported electricity and fuels; and (c) reduced emissions\n            from the energy sector. The changes include: (i)\n            establishing the Uruguay Fund for Energy Efficiency (UFEE)\n            as a guarantee fund instead of as an investment fund; (ii)\n            recruiting the Corporaci\u00f3n Nacional de Desarrollo (CND, a\n            government-owned non-banking financial entity) as the UFEE\n            trustee and asset manager; and (iii) disbursing the global\n            environmental facility (GEF) grant financing for the UFEE in\n            one payment to capitalize UFEE. These changes are essential\n            for the successful implementation of the UFEE, as an\n            instrument for energy efficiency investments by enterprises\n            and businesses - which is one of the key expected outcomes\n            of the Project. The restructuring will allow the swift\n            implementation of the UFEE, in a manner fit with the new\n            reality of Uruguay's banking sector - an unforeseen\n            event at the time of project appraisal. The restructuring is\n            essential to achieve an important outcome of the project,\n            i.e. the actual increase in energy efficiency investments by\n            enterprises and businesses in Uruguay, which will result in\n            a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions."}, "docdt": "2007-03-15T00:00:00Z"}
