support the governments of\n            the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) and its largest\n            constituent republic, the Republic of Serbia, in\n            implementing financial and enterprise sector reforms seeking\n            to significantly accelerate private sector-led-growth\n            through: 1) strengthening the financial system by\n            liquidating troubled banks and improving the environment\n            under which banks operate; 2) privatizing and restructuring\n            socially-owned enterprises that crowd out private sector\n            growth, hamper banking sector recovery, and incur\n            significant fiscal and quasi-fiscal costs; and 3) improving\n            the investment climate and business enabling environment.\n            Implementation of continued structural reforms will enhance\n            Serbia's prospects for growth, and will reinforce the\n            sustainability of its macroeconomic stabilization. The main\n            benefit of the Credit will be faster private sector growth\n            and job creation, supported by a healthier and more\n            developed financial system. A significant risk to the PFSAC\n            is the global economic downturn that could deter the\n            potential private capital inflows to Serbia, affecting the\n            success of the tender and auction privatization. Additional\n            risks could arise from what is perceived by prospective\n            investors as continued political instability in the Balkan region."}, "docdt": "2002-04-23T00:00:00Z"}
