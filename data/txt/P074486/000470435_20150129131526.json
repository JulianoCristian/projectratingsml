The\n            financial sector was in shambles, and people had little\n            confidence in the banking system. Many state-owned companies\n            were heavily indebted and lacked adequate corporate\n            governance. These problems were combined with hyperinflation\n            and high unemployment. The World Bank has helped Serbia\n            restructure the banking sector and privatize enterprises to\n            foster private sector growth and job creation. Because of\n            the interconnectedness of the two sectors, these challenges\n            had to be tackled simultaneously. Support was channeled\n            through two credits and matched by technical assistance."}, "docdt": "2005-07-09T00:00:00Z"}
