More\n            specifically, the project aims to: (a) introduce a framework\n            and criteria for selecting enterprises for rehabilitation,\n            based on potential economic, financial and technical\n            viability, and on management capacity to operate efficiently\n            and profitably; and (b) finance the rehabilitation,\n            financial restructuring and operational support to selected\n            enterprises. The restructuring process would, where\n            appropriate, include: (c) rationalization of capacity,\n            privatization, technical partnership arrangements, or if\n            necessary, closure of nonviable operations; (d) protect the\n            environment and worker safety; (e) strengthen the\n            Government's capacity to implement the rehabilitation\n            program; and (e) support policy reforms and subsector\n            reviews to strengthen enterprise operations in a\n            market-oriented environment."}, "docdt": "1989-11-21T00:00:00Z"}
