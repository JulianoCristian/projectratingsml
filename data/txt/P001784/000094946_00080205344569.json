The key lessons\n            learned from this project include: a) The success of\n            financial intermediary loans is dependent on a disciplined\n            credit environment. Measures should be included in the\n            project design to address issues relating to governance,\n            management, financial policies, and credit risk management.\n            b) Where a project has a major shift in emphasis, it is\n            essential to do a risk assessment based on the new\n            objectives, and to set up appropriate guidelines and\n            benchmarks to help determine progress toward achieving those\n            objectives. c) Development of a more comprehensive structure\n            for privatization, including clearer procedures on asset\n            valuation and methods of sale, may have avoided delays and\n            bottlenecks which were built up during project\n            implementation. In addition, a clear strategy for involving\n            local purchasers with limited purchasing power in the\n            privatization of state-owned assets and the potential cost\n            to the government of various alternatives should be\n            addressed and thoroughly assessed at the early stages of\n            project design. d) To maximize the effectiveness of\n            privatization, a program supporting the development of the\n            real sector is necessary."}, "docdt": "2000-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
