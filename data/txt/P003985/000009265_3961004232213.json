The project\n            will inter alia support:  (a) institutional strengthening to\n            improve the National Watershed Development Program\n            (regreening and reforestation) guidelines and policies,\n            overall coordination and operational support; (b)\n            development of the Upper Cimanuk watershed; and (c)\n            investment support for the regreening and reforestation\n            program.  The national institutional strengthening component\n            will provide support for improvement of planning, management\n            and natural resources information systems, the creation of a\n            multi-disciplinary upland research program and training and\n            extension.  The Upper Cimanuk Watershed Conservation and\n            Development component will stabilize critical areas in the\n            Upper Cimanuk watershed (West Java) by supporting the\n            introduction of improved farming systems on 15,750 ha of\n            arable land, combined with soil conservation practices, road\n            upgrading and drainage rehabilitation.  The Cimanuk\n            component will serve as the initial implementation area for\n            the procedural changes and technical approaches promoted by\n            the project under the national regreening and reforestation program."}, "docdt": "1993-10-19T00:00:00Z"}
