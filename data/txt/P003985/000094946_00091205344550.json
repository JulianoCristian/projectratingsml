Nonetheless,\n            sustainability is likely, based on an apparently, continual\n            commitment by the Government, in using the improved\n            watershed methodologies, developed under the project,\n            despite the need for stronger economic returns to\n            investments in projects like this one. Both performances\n            were also rated unsatisfactory; the Bank failed to provide\n            adequate supervision, and, the Borrower failed to follow up\n            preparation, and implementation with a detailed project\n            plan, and training program to prepare the implementing\n            agencies with the project work. Lessons reinforce the need\n            for government commitments in results-oriented,\n            demand-driven projects, as well as stakeholders'\n            involvement in planning project activities, such as\n            conservation, and village infrastructure works, to attain\n            the expected project development. Yet, and although quality\n            at entry is considered partially satisfactory, based on a\n            good project design responsive to government priorities for\n            promoting sustainable land use systems, certain activities,\n            such as preparation of the implementation plan, and the\n            bidding process for selection of consultants, should be\n            correctly sequenced, started prior to loan effectiveness.\n            Furthermore, the weak monitoring and evaluation,\n            particularly regarding socioeconomic aspects, was a lost\n            opportunity to assess project interventions; and,\n            complementary farm activities should increase incomes, e.g.,\n            livestock production becomes an effective complement to crop production."}, "docdt": "2000-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
