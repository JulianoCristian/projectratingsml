Some lessons learned included:\n            carefully evaluating the local capacities and interests\n            appears to be essential to avoid designing projects with an\n            overambitious geographical scope. A challenge in Nigeria is\n            that an intended geopolitical equilibrium requires having in\n            most projects at least one state from each of the six\n            geopolitical zones of the Federation. Projects should be\n            limited to a scope that is technically and logistically\n            feasible. A sound and achievable monitoring and evaluation\n            system should be put in place and used since the very\n            beginning of a project, and defining outcome indicators?\n            baseline, and where possible target values, is essential to\n            evaluate the project later on. Nigeria remains a challenging\n            environment, and having the Task Team Leader (TTL) based in\n            the field and/or allocating high supervision budgets are\n            examples of measures that can help overcome these\n            challenges. Given the Federal governance nature of Nigeria,\n            it is important to ensure that all tiers of Government are\n            fully on board with Bank's interventions to maximize\n            the impact of projects."}, "docdt": "2012-03-28T00:00:00Z"}
