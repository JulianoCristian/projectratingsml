The project\n            objective to assist the Borrower to increase access to basic\n            urban services in selected cities continues to be\n            achievable. 73.9 percent of total classified roads have been\n            constructed and rehabilitated (target 100 percent). 1.2\n            million people have access to all season roads within a 500\n            meter range (target 1.5 million). 600,000 people have access\n            to improved water resources (target 1.2 million), and 15,000\n            people have access to improved sanitation (target 20,000).\n            The overall implementation progress has improved from\n            moderately satisfactory and is now rated satisfactory. The\n            weak project management capacity was addressed by hiring a\n            consultant to assist all states in project management and\n            coordinating the implementation of all civil works\n            contracts. The community technical committees have played an\n            important role in strengthening the coordination between the\n            project implementing units at state levels, states, local\n            governments, and the benefitting communities. That helped in\n            improving the implementation progress. There has also been\n            progress in strengthening the capacity staff at state and\n            local government level in areas of project and financial\n            management, procurement, and contract management."}, "docdt": "2010-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
