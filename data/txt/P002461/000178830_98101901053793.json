The main\n            components include: (a) development of fisheries facilities\n            at Bolimog, Habo, Bossaso, and Candala; (b) a\n            pilot/exploratory test program of purse seine vessels, and\n            operation of a support vessel; and (c) assistance to the\n            management of the North East Coast Fisheries Company, design\n            of an institutional training program for the fisheries\n            sector, and studies for a future project involving harbor\n            and fisheries facilities."}, "docdt": "1984-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
