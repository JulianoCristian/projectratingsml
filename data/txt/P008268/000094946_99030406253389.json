The key lessons learned are: a) It is\n            essential to effective program implementation that there be\n            sustained Government commitment and IDA(International\n            Development Association) and Government staff continuity. b)\n            Although the objectives of both operations were clear and\n            remain relevant today, more realism should be built into the\n            timetables. c) Ultimate operational objectives should be\n            defined by clear interim steps so that the Government can\n            readily assess whether it is on track for meeting its\n            objectives or not. d) Intense supervision is required for\n            technical support, particularly for a low income country\n            with little IDA and other donor experience. e) Although the\n            Government was committed to implementing the programs agreed\n            under the Enterprise and Financial Sector Adjustment Credit,\n            the constant support and guidance of IDA was requested and\n            needed to maintain the momentum in implementing agreed\n            programs and to adhere to difficult decisions. f)\n            Albania's difficulty in creating a modern banking\n            system is not dissimilar to that of other formerly socialist\n            economies. Technical assistance is not sufficient to change\n            bank operations rapidly. g) The built-in flexibility of the\n            technical project was a crucial factor in the successful\n            outcome of this operation."}, "docdt": "1998-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
