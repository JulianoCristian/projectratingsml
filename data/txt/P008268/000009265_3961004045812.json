reform. As a\n            by-product, it is also expected to contribute directly to\n            the preparation and execution of the proposed Enterprise and\n            Financial Sector Adjustment Credit. The project will finance\n            high-priority activities of technical assistance in a few\n            key economic reform areas. Specifically, it will finance\n            resident experts and short-term consultants, studies,\n            training and limited amounts of equipment in three areas:\n            (a) macroeconomic management; (b) privatization and public\n            enterprise reform; and (c) banking sector reform and development."}, "docdt": "1993-04-21T00:00:00Z"}
