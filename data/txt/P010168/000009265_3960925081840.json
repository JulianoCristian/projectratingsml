"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The outcome of the Fourth\n            Telecommunications Project for Pakistan was successful. The\n            project was executed well, it has made a positive impact on\n            international as well as domestic long distance services,\n            its sustainability is likely, and both the Bank and the\n            Borrower performed satisfactorily. Several lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, complex financing\n            transactions and related procurement activities require\n            added sophistication in the handling of foreign financiers\n            and suppliers. Second, it would be beneficial to create a\n            small specialized unit inside the Directorate General of\n            T&T (Telegraph and Telephone Department) that is\n            responsible for handling complex financial and procurement\n            questions, such as bidding with price and teams, and\n            coordinating multilateral and bilateral sources of\n            financing. Lastly, the new unit should be staffed with\n            highly qualified employees that will receive specialized\n            training in financial matters."}, "docdt": "1988-11-22T00:00:00Z"}
