I. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
Background
1.01      All local, long distance and international public telecommuni-
cations services are provided and operated by the Pakistan Telegraph and
Telephone Department (T&T) which is also responsible for the licensing of
commercial and amateur radio transmitters and for the control of radio spec-
trum usage in Pakistan involving regulation of frequencies and operation of a
radio monitoring service.  In Pakistan, as in most countries, there are inde-
pendent telecommunications networks operated by the military, police, rail-
ways, gas and power companies, and civil aviation for their own use. These
organizations also lease facilities from T&T where appropriate.
1.02      Telephone Industries of Pakistan (TIP), established in 1952, manu-
factures telephone switching equipment, telephones and teleprinters. Its
factory located in Haripur employs about 3,800 people. Carrier Telephone
Industries (CTI), established in 1969, manufactures carrier multiplex
equipment and small capacity radio systems, at Islamabad, and employs about
400 people. The Government of Pakistan is the majority shareholder in both
companies.
Access to Service
1.03      As of June 30, 1981, Pakistan had about 282,000 direct exchange
lines (DELs) and 358,000 telephones serving its population of about 83 mil-
lion. Its telephone density of 4.2 telephones per 1,000 peoplel is very low
by world standards and far too low to meet the information flow needs of the
economy. A comparison of telephone density in Pakistan with the main world
regions is shown in Annex 1. Despite the deterrent of long waits that are
usually measured in years, the waiting lists for new connections total
200,000 applications, which equals about 42 percent of total demand
(paragraph 1.09). Such lists are only maintained in communities that have
already been provided with telephone service and therefore understate real
demand in the country as a whole. There is also a serious imbalance of
telephone development between urban and rural areas. In some parts of the
country such as Baluchistan, parts of NWFP, and the northern areas,
development has been hampered by the limitation of resources, the
geographical distances and the terrain involved.
1.04      As of June 30, 1981, there were 784 telephone exchanges providing
public telephone service and 1,160 public call offices (PCOs) serving rural
communities. Of the many thousands of communities in Pakistan only about
1,800 had access to telephone service and in about 50 percent of those
communities this only consisted of PCOs. Of the 282,000 subscribers' lines,
153,000 (54 percent) are concentrated in the three main centers of
Islamabad/Rawalpindi, Lahore and Karachi, with a further 68,000 (24 percent)
in 12 other larger towns and urban areas and only 61,000 (22 percent) in the
thousands of other small towns and villages.
1/ This can be compared to the telephone density in some other low-income
countries:  India 3.8, Sri Lanka 5.7 and Kenya 10.5.



-2-
1.05       T&T's tariffs do not discriminate between business and private
subscribers.  It is therefore difficult to determine actual usage per sub-
scriber category, but the high revenues per subscriber line (paragraph 3.12)
in a low income country indicate a very high proportion of business and
government administration use of existing telephone facilities.
1.06       Although provision is made for giving priority in telephone alloca-
tions to the Government, foreign diplomats and users whose services are
essential to the community (such as hospitals, doctors, etc.), provision of
service for other users is generally dealt with on the basis of date of
application.                                                                                     v
1.07      There are presently about 6,700 long distance circuits, 5,400 of
which are used for subscriber trunk dialing. Nationwide subscribers' trunk
dialing facilities serve about 50 of the main centers. About 820 telegraph
offices provide public service. Telex service is available at 11 main cities
with about 2,440 subscribers. Pakistan's international telephone and
telegraph services are provided mainly via the satellite earth station
located 20 miles northwest of Karachi. Other connections are available by If
radio systems and, until recently, the CENTO microwave route to Iran and
Turkey. About 240 international circuits are available. Details of telecom-
munications development in 1973-81 are given in Annex 2.
Quality of Service
1.08      Although maintenance standards and routines are reasonably satis-
factory, congested conditions and repeat call attempts result in poor service
in most of the main city networks.  This '  mainly because of underprovision
of subscribers' connections caused by inadequate expansion of the network,
which has resulted in very heavy use of the available telephones, and a rapid
increase of subscriber busy conditions and repeat call attempts together with
overloading of the exchange equipment.  There has also been a serious
underprovision of private automatic branch exchange facilities so that
business lines are not being used as effectively and do not carry the traffic
which would otherwise be the case. Although conditions on many of the main
long distance and international routes have been satisfactory, the local
network congestion is now also affecting access to these routes. Also, the
main arterial microwave route linking Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad is now
reaching the limit of its presently installed capacity. On certain of the
older routes and in life expired exchanges, existing facilities are
inadequate and transmission quality and reliability is frequently poor.
Demand for Service
1.09       The total registered demand for telephone service at June 1981 was
482,000 of which only 282,000 (58 percent) is being met. Demand has
increased historically by about 12 percent per annum over the last 10 years.
With the present increased economic activity and the extension of service tco
new areas, this increase in demand is the minimum to be expected in the



-3-
foreseeable future. The ongoing plan will in 1982 provide capacity for
about 30,000 lines and, additionally, over the following three years  48,000
lines. The proposed project will over the same period provide capacity for a
further 52,000 lines, making a total increase in capacity of 130,000. On the
basis of a high 90 percent utilization of both new and existing exchange
capacity by the end of FY85, 440,000 or 58 percent of total demand, which
will have increased to over 750,000 will have been met. A graph of the
projected growth in demand and supply of subscriber connections is shown at
Annex 3. Past and projected demand for telecommunications services are given
in the following table:

1983                360.0            244.5          604.5              60
1984                420.0            257.0          677.0              62

1986                500.0            349.3          849.3              59
1.10      Available statistical information on the demand for long distance
calls is limited to the last five years.  Over this period subscriber dialed
trunk calls have grown at 19.3 percent per annum. Manual calls have
increased by 2.3 percent over the total five-year period. The continued sub-
stantial use of manual facilities, which is costly to both the subscriber and
the administration, is believed to be largely accounted for by the dissatis-
faction of users of all kinds with the present bulk billing of subscribers-
dialed trunk (STD) calls as unidentified meter pulse units. Many subscribers
have therefore requested that they should be barred access to STD
facilities.2
2/ The introduction of toll-ticketing, provided for under the project, will
greatly reduce subscribers resistance against using STD facilities and
will also enable T&T to maintain more detailed traffic statistics for
planning and dimensioning purposes.



-4-
1.11      There are presently about 5,400 circuits on the long distance sub-
scriber dialing network connecting main centers.  The historical traffic
increase of 19.3 percent per annum through June 30, 1983, Indicates a
required circuit increase of 2,200. The project provides for 2,000 circuits
with expectation of some increase in efficiency as the capacity of the routes
Is increased. About 500 additional circuits will be provided on subsidiary
routes and over new microwave systems serving both existing exchanges and
about 200 additional exchanges (50 replacing PCOs) in rural areas of economic
significance. Some 300 new PCOs will also be provided in such areas. As
about 1,800 communities presently have access to telephone service the addi-
tion of about 450 under the project is an increase of 25 percent.
1.12      The eleven telex exchanges existing at the main centers have a
capacity of 3,530 lines with 2,440 working subscribers. Total demand at Dune
1981 was 4,920 of which only 50 percent was being satisfied. Demand has
grown at 36 percent per annum over the last five years. The project will by
June 30, 1984, have provided capacity for 2,200 additional lines, e.g., a
total capacity of 5,730 which will, based on 90 percent utilization, allow
connection of about 5,160 subscribers. Even assuming a reduction in annual
growth of demand to 20 percent, total demand will by June 1984 have grown to
8,500 of which only an estimated 61 percent can be met.
1.13       Pakistan's international communications are substantially routed
via the Karachi earth station. International telephone traffic has grown by
about 24 percent per annum over the last seven years and international telex
traffic by 41 percent per annum over the last two years.
Sector Development Strategy and Goals
1.14      Based on discussions with T&T, the Planning Cummission, tiic
Ministry of Communications and the Economic Affairs Division, the
Government's objectives for the telecommunications sector are:
(a)  To develop,T&T's internal organization to meet its
increased responsibilities and create an adequate flow of
information within T&T, to improve data processing and
accounting systems, including budgetary procedures and
control, and to identify management and functional
responsibilities;
(b) To provide satisfactory standards of service throughout
the network and improve the reliability of long distance
facilities through alternative routing;
(c) To extend facilities into new areas of socio-economic
significance with particular reference to developing
agriculture and industry, expanding mining operations and
meeting the needs of administration and social services;



-5-
(d)  To extend facilities in and between areas already served
in order to more adequately meet the growth in demand;
and
(e)  To introduce modern systems and standards while, if pos-
sible, maintairning or extending ,domestic manufacture thus
achieving efficient reliable and economic development of
services while conserving foreign exchange and providing
additional employment.
Sector Constraints
1.15      The major constraints on the improvement and development of the
sector, are:
(a)  The limited foreign exchange funds available for telecom-
munications development. Current and projected demand
together with the high profitability of T&T's operations
and the major fiscal benefits it provides to Government
(paragraph 3.11), justify a faster development of the
sector than currently available foreign funds permit.
(b)  The need to finalize arrangements for the introduction of
a modern electronic switching system which will offer
both service and economic advantages, including foreign
exchange savings. In the meantime installation of the
present high cost electromechanical system, without the
economies in accommodation and cable network facilities
which a modern electronic system would allow, should be
limited to existing exchanges, and a proliferation of
other systems should be avoided.
(c)  General government budgetary constraints wthich have
resulted in major revenue losses in the past (paragraph
1.18). While the creation of the T&T Fund3 should
assure that funds are available within T&T's approved
budget, it is important to ensure that the budget amounts
approved are adequate for the project (paragraph 2.09).
3/ The T&T-fund (paragraph 4.03) within the Government Consolidated Fund, was
made operational as from FY82. All T&T revenues are credited to the
T&T-fund and all operating expenditures plus capital expenditures within
T&T's annual budget are charged against this fund. T&T can therefore pay
these capital expenditures without going through the Treasury, nhich was
the case before the creation of this fund. Details on the T&T-fund are
available in project files.

The Bank Group's Role
1.16      IDA has been involved in three telecommurnications projects in
Pakistan. The first project (Credit 145-PAK) was approved in March 1969,
followed by two more (Credits 186-PAK and 510-PAK) in May 1970 and September
1974.  In all, the A55ociation has provided a total of US$61.8 mil-lion for
development of the telecommunications sector,
1.17      The three IDA-assisted projects have enabled the telephone system
in Pakistan to be expanded by about 140,000 direct exchange lines. Exchange
service was extended to 514 additional centers and 1,580 additional PCOs were
provided of which 870 serve rural communities. The three projects also
established the foundation for a modern domestic trunk line network. A
notable item was the provision of a microwave radio system on the backbone
route connecting Karachi, Lyallpur (Faisalabad), Lahore, Rawalpindi and
Islamabad. This facilitated introduction of subscriber direct long distance
dialing. Data on the three IDA credits are given in Annex 4.
1.18      The Project Performance Audit Report (No. 3276 dated December 31,
1980) on the third project (Credit 510-PAK) commented on the substantial
achievements under the project, but with a delay of about two and one-half
years in project execution. A major reason for this delay was government
budgetary constraints despite the fact that T&T itself generated local fundis
in excess of its requirements for operations and developmerit. The audit
Report also commented on the delay in implementing a new sectoral
organization which would enable T&T to operate more efficiently on a
semiautonomous commercial basis and on the detrimental effects of not more
fully meeting demand.  The Bank Group was considered to have played an
important role in Pakistan's telecommunications development and in the
improvement of services. Continued Bank involvement is important to assist
in T&T's institution building during a period which will be a very taxing one
for management due to both the greater management autonomy now approved, and
the major technological changes occurring in the sector.
1.19      The most important objectives of Bank Group telecommunications
sector lending strategy are to:
(a)  ensure completion of the ongoirig reorganization of the
sector and improvement of the organization within T&T.  A
vital adjunct to achieving a more efficient operation of
T&T is an effective data processing system that would
provide all levels of management with timely and adequate
information on status and performance of the telecommuni-
cations services. A need also exists to improve coordi-
nation between T&T's headquarters and the regions and
improve commercial accounting practices for the financial
monitoring of T&T.  Other objectives are to ensure satis-
factory staffing and the development of management exper-
tise and adequate definition of responsibilities in the
department.

(b) assist in reviewing fumure development proposals to
ensure that they represent a balanced program designed to
address the established economic priorities, including
those for developing agriculture and industry, and
meeting the needs of administration and social services;
(c) encourage a more thorough examination of market factors,
present levels of demand, and the possible use of greater
price rationing in urban areas including methods and
application;
(d) assist T&T in the selection of adequate technological
solutions based on least cost, taking into account neces-
sary changes to meet the increased size and sophistica-
tion of the telecommunications system; and
(e) ensure that the effects of any government financial
stringency do not unduly prejudice project execution and
effective use of revenue earning assets.
II. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Program and Project Concept
2.01      T&T has prepared a four year development plan to cover the period
July 1982 to June 1986. In addition to the new plan, T&T's overall
program for this period will, over the first three years, include a fairly
major carryover of ongoing works under the previous plan.
2.02      The new plan was divided into two phases due to:  the limitation on
available foreign exchange, the advantages of expanding switching capacity
with a modern electronic technology and the desire to avoid proliferation of
systems (see paragraph 1.15). Phase 1, which constitutes the proposed Bank
assisted project, includes local exchange and network development for
FYs83-84: additionally it includes some higher priority works in the overall
four-year period. The decision on what to include in the project was arrived
at after a review by Bank staff, T&T, the Planning Commission and the
Economic Affairs Division, taking into account the known priorities and the
financial and technological constraints. Phase 2 will cover local network
development, after the new electronic switching system has been specifically
identified and other less urgent items.
The Project
2.03      In addition to its institution building aspects (paragraphs 2.09,
3.14, 4.05 and 4.10), the proposed project covers:



-8-
(a) provision of local network facilities over the period
July 1982 to June 1984 for an additional 52,000 subscrib-
ers lines;
(b) provision of toll ticketing equipment for about 240,000
subscribers lines;
(c)  provision of up to three additional RF channels (each
providing ultimately for 960 circuits) on the main
arterial microwave system linking Karachi, Lahore and
Islamabad;
(d) installation of a new 1,800-channel microwave system
linking Karachi through Quetta and Dera Ismail Khan with
Peshawar;
(e) an increase of about 2,000 circuits on existing subscrib-
ers' long distance dialing routes;
(f) expansion of subsidiary routes providing an additional
500 circuits to existing and about 200 new small
exchanges (some replacing PCOs), provision of an
additional 300 PCOs in rural areas;
(g) provision of an earth station type A and a new interna-
tional gateway exchange at Islamabad serving the northern
part of the country;
(h)  provision of a coaxial cable fr-, Lahore tu w1gah4 to
expand and improve international communications with
India;
(i) extension of telex facilities to provide for some 1,900
additional subscribers and extension of the telex and
telegraph networks;
(j) provision of a computer for subscribers' billing and
information processing and consultancy services for
designing and implementation of the system; and
(k) replacement of worn out local cables and exchange equip-
ment (about 9,000 lines) and rehabilitation of the
Karachi-Lahore-Rawalpindi coaxial cable.
Supplementary data on the breakdown of local network provisions, PCOs and
subsidiary exchange facilities is given in Annex 5 and in project files.
4/ The Indian Government has agreed to provide the connecting section from
Wagah to Amritsar.

Project Cost
2.04      T&T's 1982-86 development program, including ongoing works, is
estimated to cost US$942 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component
of US$375 million. The project (Phase 1 of the new plan) is estimated to
cost US$287 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$1.35
million. Phase 2, making up the balance of the new plan, is estimated to
cost US$320 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$142
million.  Annexes 6 and 7 show the content, cost and annual expenditures for
Phases 1 and 2. Annex 8 is a summary of the costs and annual expenditures
for Phases 1 and 2 and the ongoing works making up the program as a whole.
Estimated local expenditures include customs duties on imported items of
US$48 million equivalent for the project and about US$140 million equivalent
for the program as a whole. Cost details for the project are summarized

Cost Estimates and Contingencies
2.05       The project costs are based on estimated early 1982 prices for
equipment, local works and customs duties. The cost estimates for
consultants financed by the Bank is based on US$8,000 per manmonth. In
preparing its project applications for Planning Division approval the T&T
Department does not provide for contingencies but is allowed by Government to
exceed the estimated figures by 15 percent during project execution. No
physical contingencies are provided as the proposals are based on detailed
engineering for systems and equipment having specific capacities, and in the
case of cables and multiplex equipment increases in one area, within the
overall network forecast, would be expected to be compensated for by reduc-
tions in other areas.
2.06       Price contingencies for the items to be financed by the Bank
have been included based on expected increases in equipment costs of 8.5
percent during 1982 and 7.5 percent annually thereafter. These figures have
been related to expected dates of procurement and result in a composite rate
of about 23 percent. Contingencies for ADB financed items average 12
percent. In the case of bilaterally financed contracts, which have been or
will shortly be signed at fixed prices, no contingency provision is
necessary. Similarly, the items proposed for Japanese credit financing have
been costed on the basis of prices discussed with a Japanese mission and are
believed to be firm and include built-in contingencies. In the case of the
Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) items, where the initial credit was
approved in 1980 and orders will shortly be placed, the overall contingency
rate is 12 percent. Local cost contingencies for customs duties are based on
foreign cost inflation. Local project costs are expected to increase by 8
percent per annum.
Project Financing
2.07       The Government has limited foreign funds available for the develop-
ment of the telecommunications sector, despite the major fiscal benefits T&T
provides to Government (paragraphs 1.15 and 3.11). T&T will therefore have
to rely on non-government sources for the foreign funds financing of its
investment program. The likely sources of financing for project items
needing foreign exchange are indicated in the following table:

About US$10.0 million of the proposed KfW financing is available under an
existing credit.  Discussions with Japanese Government officials indicate
that they are considering an application, which was submitted in July 1981,
from the Government of Pakistan for the additional Japanese financing. The
financing of the telex exchanges has already been arranged through a Japarnese
suppliers credit. Although the project would be fully viable without the



- 13 -
items to be financed by ADB or the Japanese Government, the items proposed
for Bank financing are dependent for effective use on the supply of
locally manufactured items using material and components for which additional
KfW financing is being sought (with arn alternative of a possible suppliers'
credit).  Financing from other sources for these items is not considered
practicable in view of the tied nature of the procurement.  In November 1981,
the Government of Pakistan submitted an application to the Federal Republic
of Germany for a credit of about US$30.0 million needed to complete the
project. Awaiting the formalizaton of this credit, a German supplier's
credit for US$5.0 million has been arranged and Government has provided
bridge financing for US$10.0 million. This will keep the factories working
for at least the first year of the project period.
Procurement
2.08       All Bank-financed items would be procured through international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's procurement guidelines.
Local manufacturers would be allowed a 15 percent preference subject to usual
Bank terms and conditions. Government has indicated that it is studying
possible ways of dealing with the duty charged on imported components for
local manufacture to obtain the full advantages of the local preference under
usual Bank terms. In view of the time required to start local manufacturing,
the amount which may qualify for financing under the credit is considered
nominal and unlikely to exceed $2.0 million, mainly consisting of pulse code
multiplex equipment.
Project Implementation
2.09       Surveys and preparation of specifications for the main project
items are already in hand and network design well advanced. T&T's staff
will, with the assistance of contractors on the more complex installations,
have the ability to carry out the project as planned. Local consultants will
be employed, if necessary with limited expatriate assistance, to design and
implement a computerized billing and information system. An estimated pro-
ject implementation schedule is given in Annex 9. Due to the delay of pre-
vious Bank group financed projects resulting from budgetary constraints
(paragraph 1.18), assurances were obtained from Government during
negotiations that adequate annual budget amounts will be approved for T&T's
development program.
Disbursements
2.10       A projected disbursement schedule is given in Annex 10.  Although
the project comprises part of T&T's FYs82-86 development program, with a con-
centration of Bank financed items in FYs83-84, the proposed Loan is not
expected to be fully disbursed before FY87. This is in line with previous
Bank group experience in the telecommurnications sector. Disbursement would
be made on the basis of 100 percent of the CIF cost (including installers'
services)of imported equipmerit; 100 percent of the foreign cost of



- 14 -
consultants; andlO0 percent of ex-factory prices of locally manufactured
items.
Performance Indicators
2.11       Indicators which should assist in monitoring T&T's performance in
executing the project are set out in Annex 11.  In the case of the rate of
return, T&T is expected to substantially exceed the required 10 percent
(paragraph 5.13). This is reflected by the indicators. T&T will indicate
achievements as against these indicators in the half-yearly progress reports
it would submit to the Bank.  These indicators were discussed and agreed
during negotiations.
III. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
3.01      The economic analysis refers to the whole of T&T's FYsS2-86 invest-
ment program, of wihich the proposed Bank-assisted project is an integral
part.
Role of Telecommunications in the Economy
3.02       Pakistan has faced many special problems in developing an inte-
grated economy. These include: the country's history, with the need to
create a new national capital and adequate lines of communication with the
provinces; the social and economic changes that followed the independence of
Bangladesh; the distances separating the population centers; and the wide
dispersion of administration, agriculture and industry. These problems high-
light the need for adequate telecommunication facilities. Many essential
social services such as those for public health and welfare involve use of
staff with limited expertise who may have to obtain advice or direction from
more qualified individuals at the main centers. By providing a means of
rapid communication, telecommunications forms part of the infrastructure
required for national development and for ensuring effective use of available
resources and expertise.
3.03      Further expansion of Pakistan's industry, which involves the coord-
ination of a series of operations which are highly dependent on adequate
telecommunication facilities, is important to economic growth and improvement
of the balance of payments. With a large part of the population dependent on
agriculture for its livelihood, adequate telecommunications are of high
priority to arrange sales and delivery of agricultural products and to
coordinate the transport and timely delivery of fertilizers and other
inputs. With the country relying on imported petroleum supplies, the
efficient use of limited and costly transportation facilities is also a vital
necessity, and these facilities can best be coordinated through adequate
telecommunications service.



- 15 -
Demand for Telecommunications Services
3.04       As outlined in paragraphs 1.09 to 1,13 there is a large unsatisfied
demand for telephone and telex services in Pakistan. At the end of the
project period it is estimated that only 59 percent of outstanding telephone
demand and 61 percent of telex demand would have been met.
Project Size, Composition, and Technology
3.05      As outlined in paragraph 2.02, the size of the proposed project has
been limited primarily by the availability of foreign exchange financing and,
to a lesser extent, by the planned change in switching technology. The pro-
ject addresses the need to improve standards of service and reliability,
expand service into rural areas and, within the accepted restraints, meet
part of the existing demand in urban areas. The project is heavily directed
towards improvement and expansion of long distance (38.5 percent), interna-
tional (10.7 percent) and telex facilities (5.6 percent). Local telephone
network expansion is limited (21.7 percent). For the reasons outlined
earlier, project content is considered reasonable and in line with the eco-
nomic priorities.
3.06      The dimensioning and timing of the major works included in the pro-
ject are based on engineering studies, made by T&T with some assistance from
expatriate experts. They are designed to determine the least cost solution
for each work. The local network expansion has to some extent been influ-
enced by the proposed change in switching technology. The expansion of each
individual exchange, however, has been dimensioned using standard analytical
techniques and provisioning periods to maximize economies of scale. The pro-
ject is, within the context of the overall program and the provision for
local network expansion under ongoing works, considered to be the best com-
promise which can be adopted given the known priorities, the limitation on
available foreign exchange, and the proposed change in switching technology.
3.07       TIP (paragraph 1.02) with a capacity of 50,000 telephone lines per
annum is presently producing about 25,000 to 30,000 lines of electromechani-
cal switching equipment (EMD) a year. Based on T&T's figures, the cost of
EMD production per line, excluding customs duties, is about $340. This cost
is high compared with world prices ranging between $200 and $300 per line for
more modern equipment offering additional facilities together with savings in
external plant and accommodation.   The high cost of production is partly due
to low use of production capacity and the high cost of components. CTI
(paragraph 1.02) is producing multiplex equipment and VHF and UHF radio
systems for T&T. Present costs are high compared with those obtained through
international competitive bidding. Following the introduction of a more
modern multiplex system production, costs are likely to fall by about 30 per-
cent and become competitive.



- 16 -
3.08       In 1979, T&T set up a committee to review its position in relation
to worldwide advances in switching technology; this committee has now recom--
mended that T&T should adopt electronic digital switching technology as the
future standard for Pakistan, together with the development of a local
industry based on this technology.  This recommendation is fully endorsed by
the Bank.  Major international suppliers have been approached and have
submitted proposals for manufacture of such a system in Pakistan. However,
due to fiscal constraints, which puts a limit on development, T&T is
presently unable to proceed with the introduction of a new system. To avoidl
proliferation of different types of new equipment, it is desirable in the
meantime to continue to meet the most critical needs for switching with EMD
equipment. It will also be necesary to continue production of EMD equipment
at a reduced level for some years for expansion of existing exchanges and the
supply of spare parts.
Distribution of Program Benefits
3.09      It is difficult to estabLish actual telephone usage per subscriber
category as no differentiation is made between government, business and pri.-
vate subscribers (paragraph 1.05). The high revenues per subscriber line
(paragraph 3.12), however, indicate a heavy business and government use of
existing facilities.
3.10      The high proportion of long distance, international and telex fac-
ilities (paragraph 3.05) in T&T's investment program will mainly benefit
business and government subscribers, who are the main users. The provision
under the program of new subsidiary routes, rural exchanges and PCOs will
mainly benefit the populations of currently unserviced rural areas.
Fiscal Impact
3.11       Up to FY75, Government had to provide some support for T&T through
equity contributions. Mainly due to tariff increases (paragraph 3.12), T&T's
cash flow improved dramatically and as from FY76 Government has collected
more funds through T&T than it spent on T&T. The net fiscal surplus is esti-
mated at PRs 2,600 million for the FYs75-81 period (see Annex 12). Due to
expected traffic increases brought about by the investments under T&T's
FYs82-86 program, the fiscal surplus which government will receive over the
FYs82-86 period is estimated to be about PRs 6,750 million (US$675 million).
Tariffs Policies
3.12       A summary of T&T's present tariffs is given in Annex 13.  Except
for the monthly rental charges, domestic telephone tariffs have, with
Government approval, been increased since FY74 well above the rate of
inflation.

b/ Estimated.
In FY82, T&T expects to bill its subscribers an average of over US$750 each,
which is high by most standards. Since T&T is expected to generate with cur-
rent tariffs substantially more local currency funds than is needed for its
FYs82-86 development program (paragraph 3.11), no general tariff increase
will be needed during the project period for the purpose of maintaining
adequate internal cash generation.
3.13      T&T's tariff structure is in line with current practices in many
other developing countries.  In an attempt to better ration demand, a scheme
was introduced in 1979 in the Karachi and Lahore areas giving special
priority to applicants who paid an additional connection fee of PRs 2,000
(US$200). This scheme has resulted in some administrative and technical
problems, however, and is therefore being reviewed. Subscriber dialed trunk
calls over 480 miles are priced lower than similar operator assisted calls,
which is justified by the lower cost for STD calls. However, STD calls for
distances under 480 miles are priced higher than similar operator assisted
calls. Although no general tariff increase is needed for financial reasons,
a study of T&T's tariff structure and long-term investment program should be
undertaken with special attention to:
(a)  use of off-peak hour call charges to increase circuit
utilization and to reduce congestion;
(b)  potential for increasing connection fees and/or deposits
in urban areas with long waiting lists and severely
limited available facilities;
(c)  increasing monthly rental fees, especially for telex sub-
scribers;



- 18 
(d)  revision of long-distance tariffs for distances under 480
miles to encourage the use of STD facilities;5 and
(e)  possible accelerated expansion of the sector to increase
the potential use of telecommunications revenues as a
vehicle for domestic resource mobilization.
3.14       During negotiations, assurances were obtained that T&T will
undertake the investment and tariff study under terms of reference satisfac-
tory to the Bank, and that the results will be submitted to the Bank for
comment not later than September 30, 1983.
Return on Investment
3.15       The internal financial rate of return (defined as the discount rate
which produces a zero net present value of projected incremental cash flows)
of T&T's FY82-86 investment program is 26 percent (see Annex 14).  If the
Phase 2 (FYs85-86 portion) of T&T's investment program is not undertaken, the
financial rate of return on Phase 1 together with the ongoing program would
be 31 percent.  This higher rate is mainly due to the concentration in Phase
1 of long-distance, international and telex facilities, which generally
produce higher revenues per invested dollar than investments in local
telephone network.
3.16       T&T pays custom duties on imported goods of about 40 percent.
Excluding custom duties from capital expenditures for the investment prograrn,
a minimum estimate of the economic rate of return on T&T's FYs82-86 program
is 31 percent. No shadow pricing of labor or foreign exchange has been used
for the calculations as no surplus exists for the kind of labor T&T employs
and the official exchange rate has been found acceptable for these
calculations.
3.17       These rates of return understate the benefits to be derived from
the investment program by telecommunications users and nonusers. No attempt
has been made to estimate the consumer surplus for new subscribers or
increases in consumer surplus for existing subscribers as the quality of ser-
vice is improved.  Furthermore, some equipment installed under the program
could handle substantially higher traffic volumes with inexpensive additional
investments. No related additional revenues, however, have been incorporated
in the rate of return calculations.
Risk
3.18       Due to the large unsatisfied demand for telecommunications ser-
vices, the project offers no significant risk resulting from a possible
5/ The introduction of toll ticketing will also encourage the use of STD
facilities (paragraphs 1.10 and 4.16).



- 19 -
reduction in economic activity.  Furthermore, since the program comprises a
number of partly independent activities, delay in the completion of individ-
ual works would not generally prevent the use of other completed program com-
ponents. Costs and benefits of telecommunications projects tend to be
delayed in roughly the same degree, so that the impact on the return on
investment may not be significant.
3.19      A sensitivity analsysis on the financial rate of return of the
investment program (26%) indicates that a combination of 10 percent higher
capital expenditures, 10 percent higher operating costs and 10 percent lower
revenues, would result in an internal financial rate of return of not less
than 21 percent (Annex 14).
Environmental and Health Aspects
3.20       No adverse environmental or health effects are expected from the
project; in fact, some benefits may be expected from the use of telecommuni-
cations in place of transportation, and also the better coordination of
transportation with reduced atmospheric pollution and more efficient use of
natural resources as a consequence. The project also offers health and
social advantages in making scarce expertise available for consultation over
a wider area and facilitating arrangements for transportation of individuals
in case of emergency.
Future Development Considerations
3.21       The need for an intensified effort to reduce the gap between supply
and demand for telephone facilities has been commented on in the audit for
the Third Project (paragraph 1.18). However in view of Pakistan's severe
foreign exchange constraint, the expansion of telecommunications must con-
tinue to be weighed carefully against broader national objectives and the
competing demands of other sectors. Given the problem of the necessary
change in switching technology (paragraph 3.08) it is apparent that little
more can be done under the propsed project to increase supply. It is pro-
posed that the investment and tariff study (paragraph 3.13) will examine both
the investment needs and revenue benefits which might justify increases under
possible further telecommunications projects and the case for a concerted
effort to close the supply demand gap over the longer term.
IV. THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
Organization
4.01       From its creation at the time of partition, T&T has operated as a
government department under the control of the Ministry of Communications
with a number of its managerial and operating functions performed by other
government authorities, e.g., financial control exercised by the Ministry of



- 20 -
Finance, accounting in addition to auditing performed by the Auditor-
General, personnel matters controlled by the Public Service Commission, pro-
curement by the Supply Department and building design and construction by the
Public Works Department.  This was not conducive to efficient operation on a
commercial basis with adequately defined accountability and responsibility.
4.02       From the inception of its involvement in Pakistan's
telecommunications sector in 1968/1969, the Bank group has encouraged
reorganization of the sector in order to enable T&T to operate on an
efficient commercial basis and provide for adequate financial and operational
autonomy. The Government decided in 1969 to reorganize T&T as a government
corporation, but the process was delayed firstly by political disruption in
1970-1972 and later by Government's misgivings about the proposal in view of
shortcomings in the performance of other semiautonomous boards and public
corporations. To meet this objection, the Bank indicated that it saw no
major difficulty in public telecommunications services continuing to be
operated as a government department provided T&T was organized to operate
effectively along commercial lines with adequate autonomy in its operations,
full control over its accounting functions, and having its own trust fund
separated from the Government Consolidated Fund.
4.03       Based on the Bank's suggestions, Government finally agreed to
reorganize T&T along the above lines, and an implementing order was issued on
May 30, 1979. A number of functions were immediately transferred to T&T and
a T&T Fund was made effective July 1, 1981. The responsibility for the
accounting function and staff was transferred to T&T as from January 1, 1981,
and long outstanding suspense accounts and receivables and establishment of
government's equity investment in T&T were identified in early 1981. All new
arrangeme.lts were fully operational as from July 1, 1981, the begill!'.'  ef
fiscal year 1982.
4.04       The present organization of T&T is set out in Annex 15, and its
relation to other government authorities in Annex 16.  The 1979 reorganiza-
tion and subsequent action provide a satisfactory framework for future opera-
tion of T&T on a commercial basis. Much more remains to be done however, to
streamline the internal organization; define responsibilities; improve lines
of command and coordination and long-term planning; improved budgetary
control and set up an efficient data processing system which would provide
the information necessary for adequate financial and operational management.
Staff and Training
4.05       As of end FY81, T&T employed about 35,300 people.  Although it was
anticipated under the second and third projects that steps would be taken to
reduce the ratio of staff to telephones by at least 4 percent annually,
staffing levels continue to remain relatively high.  Over the period 1971 to
1976, T&T achieved a rate of staff reduction of almost 4 percent, and brought
the number of staff down from 131 to 109 per thousand telephones. From 1977
to 1981 this number was reduced to 98 per thousand, an average reduction of



- 21 -
about 2 percent per annum.  The failure to achieve the expected reduction was
largely due to the loss of experienced staff to the OPEC countries (a
contribution T&T is making to Pakistan's balance-of-payments position).
However, due to the relatively low levels of wages and salaries, labor costs
per telephone are not excessive. With the exodus of expert staff now
slowing, and with recent increases in its training program, T&T now expects
to make more rapid reductions in its staff to telephone ratio. Under the
proposed project, T&T agreed to reduce the ratio of staff to telephones in
service by at least 4 percent annually until a ratio of 70 staff per 1,000
telephones is reached.
4.06       T&T currently has good training facilities:  it has central
Training Institute at Haripur which is designed to provide courses for
supervising and higher-level technicdl staff either from within T&T or for
the graduate and diploma-level intake. Four Regional Training Schools
provide technical training, and District Schools provide vocational
training. In all, some 6,000 people attend courses each year with about
2,300 people attending advanced classes at technician or supervisor level.
Accounting
4.07       Since its creation, T&T operated under a cash-basis accounting
system typical of governmental departments. Through FY80, T&T's cash flow
was not separated from the Central Government's Consolidated Fund and under
this system adequate information was not produced for T&T's financial manage-
ment.The weakness of the system was recognized by Government and IDA and
under Credit 510-PAK, Government agreed that commercial financial statements
would be produced as from FY75. Such statements have been produced by T&T
sirice FY75 based on the cash accounts prepared by the Accountant General in
Lahore. However, T&T's cash-flow was still not separated from the Government
Consolidated Fund, the quality of the cash accounts was poor, and parts of
equity, receivables and current liabilities were not adequately defined
(partly due to the separation of Pakistan and Bangladesh).
4.08       As part of T&T's 1979 reorganization as a largely autonomous
department, T&T was required to prepare its accounts on an accrual basis and
a proforma T&T fund was set up as of July 1, 1980, within the Government's
Consolidated Fund. The responsibility of the accounting function was effec-
tively transferred from the Accountant General in Lahore to T&T on January 1,
1981. By January 1981, staff from T&T and the Auditor General's office had
also identified all receivables and current liabilities previously shown
under suspense accounts awaiting reconsiliation. As from FY82, T&T will
therefore be able to produce adequate commercial financial statements.
4.09       Since assuming full responsibility for its accounting, T&T's finan-
cial management has begun to introduce stricter internal controls over cash
mariagement, has decentralized certain accounting functions and has also
started studies on the mechanization of accounting routines (e.g., wages and
stores,). The present and projected volume of T&T's operations indicate that



- 22 -
T&T should have its own computer facilities and in-house computer expertise
(system analysts, programmers, and operators) for the efficient operation of
these facilities.  The provision of a computer, and limited consultants
assistance, is therefore included under the project.   T&T retained in mid
1981 a local consultant paid for by its own funds to undertake an overall
review of its computer applications. A copy of his report was handed over
to the Bank during negotiations and the report was found satisfactory.  Funds
for expatriate assistance, if needed,have been provided for under the Bank
loan.
4.10       During negotiations, the status of TVT's accounting system and its
mechanization was reviewed. Special attention was paid to the treatment in
T&T's commercial financial statements forFY81 of: T&T-fund, government
equity and contribution to Government, debt service to Government and classi-
fication of current assets and liabilities. Several deficiencies were found
to still exist and assurances were obtained that T&T will review the adequacy
of its commercial accounting system and financial statements and to make
appropriate adjustments in its accounts for FY82, as necessary, in a manner
satisfactory to the Bank.
Audit
4.11       T&T's accounts are audited by two government bodies:
(a)  the Auditor General, who conducts a government-type
audit focusing on cash and compliance with government
rules and regulations; and
(b   the Director _  Commercial Audi t who, und-^ the Au1itor
General, will now begin to conduct commercial audits of
T&T's accounts. If the Director of Commercial Audit is
unable to produce timely audit reports satisfactory to
the Bank, the Secretary of Finance has agreed that the
services of an outside auditor can be retained.
4.12       Up to 1980, the Auditor General objected to completing audit
reports on T&T's commercial accounts until all items classified in suspense
accounts were identified and adequatly reconciled with government accounts.
During the Bank's November 1980 preappraisal mission, the Auditor General's
office agreed to make audit reports, despite all suspense accounts not being
defined at the time, with whatever observations and qualifications the audit
may call for. The Auditor General has now completed the audits through FY80
and his audit reports for FYs75-80 were received by the Bank during negotia-
tions together with provisional accounts for FY81.
4.13       During negotiations, assurances were obtained that T&T will furnish
the Bank with its financial statements and corresponding audit reports within
six months after the end of its fiscal year, and if necessary, an outside
auditor will be retained for this purpose.



- 23 -
Billing and Collection
4.14       T&T bills its subscribers on a monthly basis and bills are prepared
in Karachi and Lahore on the computers of National Bank and Habib Bank.  T&T
is rapidly outgrowing these computer facilities and the preparation of bills
has at times been substantially delayed.  Due to a 1972-77 ban on imports of
computers, T&T was compelled to use the Banks' computer services despite a
fourfold increase of their charges in the period between 1970 to 1980. The
banks now plan to charge on a per line basis for their billing service. The
cost for this service is already high and would become prohibitive if calcu-
lated on a per line basis once toll-ticketing is introduced and details for
long-distance calls included in the bills.
4.15       T&T generally sends its bills to its subscribers within one month
of the close of the billing period. The subscriber is given one month after
having received the bill to pay the bill before his telephone is disconnected
or other action taken. The collection has worked reasonably well in the past
and at the end of FY80 T&T's accounts receivables for services equalled
little more than two months of billing, which is acceptable.
4.16       T&T has been criticized by the press and by subscribers for
inaccurate bills (see paragraph 1.10).  A large number of complaints could be
avoided if all long-distance calls in T&T's bills were adequately specified.
This will only be possible, however, to the extent that toll-ticketing is
introduced. T&T will, therefore, together with other computer applications
in T&T, review its current billing procudures so that efficient use is made
of toll-ticketing equipment provided under the project.
V. FINANCES
Financial Performance
5.01       Due to a lack of definition of government equity and repayment
schedules for T&T's long-term debt to government, cash accounting, and sus-
pense accounts (see paragraphs 4.07-4.08), T&T's commercial financial state-
ments do not fully reflect its past financial performance. The creation of
the T&T-fund, the definition of suspense accounts, and other changes of
accounting procedures may lead to adjustments in FY82 for the previous fiscal
years (paragraph 4.10). These adjustments are, however, not expected to be
of a magnitude to substantially change the financial picture of T&T.
5.02       T&T's income statements for FYs78-80 are given in Annex 18  and
notes in Annex 17. A summary is given below:

a/ Provisional.
b/  (a) on historic cost basis, (b) on tentatively

5.03       The sharp increase in revenues in FY79 was mainly due to the
increase in pulse and long-distance charges as of July 1, 1978 (see paragraph
3.12).  This led to an average annual revenue per telephone subscriber of
about US$500 in FYs79-80,6 which is high as compared with most countries.
Operating costs have been maintained at a relatively low level, which
explains the high rate of return.
Financial Position
5.04       T&T's balance sheets for FYs78-81 are given in Annex 19 and notes
in Annex 17.  A summary of T&T's financial position as of June 30, 1981, is
given below:
6/ Mainly due to the tariff increase as of July 1, 1980, the average revenue
per subscriber for FY81 is estimated at over $650 and for FY82 over $750
(see paragraph 3.12).

5.05      No repayment schedule exists for government long-term loans to
T&T. Long-term debt and interest on such debt have therefore been accumu-
lated in T&T's commercial accounts. The interest accumulated up to FY81
under current liabilities amounted to PRs 1,345 million, which explains the
negative working capital. On the other hand, the prescribed return on
governmerit equity was not booked, as the exact amount of such equity was not
established. The FY81 accumulated amount for return on government's equity
has been estimated at PRs 950 million for projection purposes.
5.06       The accumulation of government loans and interest may have been
justified up to FY76, as T&T did not generate necessary funds for debt ser-
vice and needed contributions from government for its expansion.  As of FY76,
however, T&T started to generate funds in excess of its needs mainly due to
frequent tariff increases (paragraph 3.12).  According to T&T's FYs79-81
financial statements, T&T's annual net contribution to Government exceeded
PRs 600 million. This contribution has been overstated, however, by the
amounts that should have been used for service on long-term debt to govern-
ment. The situation will be dealt with in the review of T&T's accounting
system (paragraph 4.10).
5.07       Up to FY81, before the T&T-fund was made operational, all cash
generation (before debt service) in excess of T&T's requirements for its
operations and capital construction was paid as a contribution into the
Government Consolidated Fund. In this way, the major part of T&T's earnings



- 26 -
were not retained in T&T as equity, resulting in a weaker debt/equity ratio.
Nonetheless T&T's FY80 financial position is adequate and is likely to
improve as from FY82 when the T&T fund will be shown as an asset.
Valuation of Fixed Assets
5.08       T&T's fixed assets are valued at historic cost including capital-
ized exchange losses due to the 1972 devaluation of the PR and other adjust-
ments to assets acquired before June 30, 1973, as recommended by a
government-appointed committee.  On the Bank's recommendation, T&T's low
depreciation rates for commercial accounting purposes were increased to an
average of about 4.5 percent, which is in line with plant history and current
practices in the telecommunications sector. In this connection T&T also
carried out an inventory and reclassification of its fixed assets.
5.09      No attempt has been made since FY73 to evaluate the impact of
inflation on the value of T&T's fixed assets. Accumulated inflation in
FYs72-81 totalled about 190 percent (wholesale index for manufacture), which
indicates that T&T's fixed assets may be undervalued. Accordingly, for pur--
poses of calculating T&T's rate of return (paragraph 5.13), T&T would by
December 31, 1982, submit to the Bank for comment methods of revaluation of
its fixed assets and as from FY83 annually revalue these assets in accordance
with methods satisfactory to the Bank.
5.10       For the purposes of the financial projections presented in this
report, the book value of T&T's fixed assets has tentatively been revalued
from FY72 to FY81 with the wholesale index for manufacture, and from FY82 at,
8 percent per year. The resulting revalued fixed asset value per exchange
line may be on the high side compared with current replacement cost. Asset
values include, however, a 40 percent custom duty charged on imported equip-
ment and equipment of a relatively expensive technology. Therefore, in the
absence of a more detailed revaluation study, these asset values have been
considered acceptable for projection purposes.

a/  (1) On historic cost basis, (2) on revalued basis (see paragraph 5.10).
5.12      The financial projections are based on the tariff level as of
July 1, 1981 and no further tariff increase has been assumed during the
project period (see paragraph 3.12). T&T's projected financial performance
is satisfactory and at the end of the project period (FY86), T&T is expected
to have a sound financial position with a long-term debt equal to only 23
percent of total capitalization (including projected revaluation reserve).
5.13       It is unlikely that, during the project period, T&T would be unable
to generate adequate local funds for its investment program or produce an
acceptable rate of return. The current and projected large unsatisfied
demand for telecommunications services makes T&T less sensitive to a possible
reduction in economic activity (paragraph 3.18). However, to assure an ade-
quate tariff level beyond the project period, the 10 percent rate of return
on revalued net fixed assets in operation as covenanted under Credit 510-PAK,
is required under the proposed project. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained that T&T will maintain a rate of return of at least 10 percent on
revalued net fixed assets in operation.

average 60 percent, all of which is satisfactory.

VI.  CONCLUSIONS AND AGREEMENTS REACHED
6.01       During negotiations assurances were obtained from Governmerit and
T&T that:
(a)  T&T's annual development budget will be adequate to carry
out the project as planned (paragraphs 1.15 and 2.09);
(b)  finarIcirig has been arranged or the Governmerit will make
available to T&T necessary foreign funds required for the
project (paragraph 2.07);
(c)  a tariff and investment study will be undertaken urnder
terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank and results
of this study will be submitted to the Bank for comment
not later than by September 30, 1983 (paragraph 3.14);
(d) the ratio of T&T staff to telephories in service will be
reduced by 4 percent per annum as from FY82 until a ratio
of 70 staff per 1,000 telephones has been reached
(paragraph 4.04);
(e)  T&T's commercial accounting system will be reviewed and
adjustments of past bookings will be made in a manner
satisfactory to the Bank (paragraph 4.10);
(f) The Bank will be furnished with T&T's financial
statements and corresponding audit reports within six
months after the end of each fiscal year (paragraph
4.13); and
(g) T&T's tariffs will, as from FY83, be maintained at a
level as to produce a rate of returri of at least 10 per-
cent on average revalued net fixed assets li operation
(paragraph 5.13). For this purpose, T&T will by December
31, 1982, submit to the Bank for comment methods of
revaluation of its fixed assets and as from FY82 annually
revalue its fixed assets in accordance with methods
satisfactory to the Bank (paragraphs 5.09).
6.02       The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan
to the Government of Pakistan of  US$40 million.

FOURTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Fiscal Impact
1.        The fiscal impact of T&T's operations has been estimated based on
the following simplified assumptions:
(a) T&T pays a 40% custom duty on imported equipment up to
FY81, the custom duty has been assumed to equal 20% on
T&T's total investment cost;
(b) interest on government long-term loans to T&T and equity
contributions has been calculated at the rate estab-
lished by government for each year, even if not actually
booked by T&T. Government contributions have been
adjusted accordingly;
(c) T&T will start amortizing loans from government over 10
years starting FY83;
(d)  government pays 12% interest on withdrawn IBRD amounts,
and a service charge of 3/4% on the ADB credit. Amorti-
zation starts after four years of grace (after the pro-
jection period);
(e) government pays an average interest of 4% on loans,
credits and grants other than IDB and IDA (German,
Swiss, Duch, Canadian, Italian, US, UK and Japanese) and
amortize them over 20 years after 5-years of grace; and
(f)  all funds generated by T&T in excess of its requirements
for operation and expansion will be accredited to the
Government Consolidated Fund (through the T&T-fund or
otherwise), for the use by government in other sectors.
2.        Based on these assumptions, the table at the end of this annex in
PRs million has been constructed.
3.        After having had to financially support up to FY75, government
has collected more funds from T&T than it spent on T&T. The net fiscal
surplus increased sharply as from FY78, mainly due to the frequent tele-
phone tariff increases. During the project period, FYs82-86, the net fixed
surplus of T&T's operations is estimated to be about PRs 6,760 million
(US$676 million), mainly due to expected traffic increases and higher
earnings brought about by the program.

FOURTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Return On Investment
1.        T&T's FYs82-86 investment program includes ongoing works, Phase 1
(the project) and Phase 2 (starting in FY84). The close inter-relation
between ongoing works and new works makes arbitrary any attempt to separate
incremental costs and revenues between the project and nonproject components
of the program. The rate of return calculations are therefore based on the
whole of T&T's FYs82-86 investment program. however, as part of the sensiti-
vity analysis, a rate of return has been calculated assuming that Phase 2 is
not undertaken.
2.        All components for the rate of return calculations are expressed in
PRs at FY82 constant purchasing power. For this purpose, a deflator of 10
percent per year has been applied to nominal values of incrementaTTcost and
revenue streams from FY83 up to FY87. As from FY88 onwards, incremental cost
and revenue streams are assumed to remain constant in real terms.
3.         The benefit period extends from FY84 to FY05, when on average the
equipment provided under the program is expected to have substantially
completed its useful life.  No residual values of programmed investments have
been taken into account as the FY82 present value would be insignificant.
4.         As from FY87, operating costs and revenues related to the program
are assumed to remain constant in real terms. Incremental revenue estimates
are based on FY82 tariff levels (no tariff increase projected under the
project period) and projected increase in numbers of telephone and telex sub-
scribers and consequent traffic increases attributable to the program. T&T's
telecommunications facilities are currently so congested that no significant
traffic increase can be handled without new investments. Operating cost
estimates are based on additional assets and traffic generated under the pro-
gram, excluding depreciation and interest.
5.        A summary of cost and revenue streams at FY82 purchasing power is
given below in PRs million:

83         1,582.9         21.3           201.8
84         1,701.9         43.9           666.4
85         1,392.7         66.8         1,254.9
86         1,477.2         91.9         1,586.4
87           310.0        140.5        2,080-.2
88-05          -          140.5        2,100.0
The above cost and revenue streams result in a financial rater of return ol
26.4 percent.
6.         A sensitivity analysis was performed with the following results:
(a)  10 percent increase in capital expenditures             23.9%
(b)  10 percent increase in operating cost                   26.2%
(c)  10 percent increase in revenues                         23.5%
(d)  combination of (a), (b) and (c) above                   21.1%
7.         If Phase 2 of T&T's FYs82-86 investment program is not undertaken,
the financial rate of return of remaining parts of the program would be 30.6
percent.  In addition to paragraphs 1 to 4 above, this rate of return is
based on the following assumptions:
(a)  no new subscribers will be connected after FY85, and no new
telephone rentals or connection fees will be collected
after that year;
(b)  half of projected increases in long distance and
international revenues after FY85 are generated by new
subscribers connected as from that year; and
(c)  about half of projected increases in operating costs after
FY85 are caused by new subscribers connected as from that
year.
8.         The rate of return of the whole FYs82-86 investment program (26.4%)
is lower than the rate of return of the program excluding Phase 2 (30.6%).
This is mainly due to the concentration in Phase 1 of long-distance,
international and telex facilities, which traditionally are the money making
services in telecommunications sector. Phase 2 includes a higher proportion
of subscriber equipment.
9.         The economic rate of return (excluding 40 percent custom duties on
imported goods has been estimated at 31.3 percent for the whole FYs82-86
investment program.



- 47 -
ANNEX 14
Page 3 of 3 pages
This rate should be regarded as minimum of the economic rate of return
because:
(a) no attempt has been made to estimate the consumer surplus
for new subscribers or increase in consumer surplus for
existing subscribers when telephone tariffs decrease in
real terms and the quality of service is improved; and
(b) no increase in net revenues after FY87 has been attri-
butedto the FYs82-86 investment program. Some of the
equipment to be installed has, however, ample spare
capacity and could handle substantially higher traffic
volume with inexpens-ive marginal investments. Therefore,
the full benefits of the FYs82-86 investment program will
not be obtained before facilities are expanded under sub-
sequent programs.

ANNEX 17
Page 1 of 2 pages
PAKISTAN
TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE DEPARTMENT (T&T)
FOURTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Notes and Assumptions on T&T's Financial Statements
1.         Projections for FY81 are based on T&T's revised budget and
projections for subsequent years are based on the following assumptions:
Income Statement
2.         Telephone rental charges are projected on the basis of average
number of telephone subscribers and FY81 average rental fees per
subscriber.
3.        Call charges include charges for local and automatic long
distance calls (and up to FY81 also international calls). Traffic is
projected to increase as from FY82 by 15% per year except for FY85, when a
30% increase is expected due to the completion of major long distance
links.
4.         International telephone revenues are projected to increase by 20%
per year, except for FY84 when an additional increase of 20% is expected
due to the completion of the type B earth satellite station and new routing
of international traffic.
5.         Installation fees are projected based on the number of sujbscriber
to be connected times the installation fee of PRs 2,000 per subscriber.
6.         Telegraph revenues are expected to remain constant as from FY82
as increased traffic will be handled by new telex facilities.
7.         Telex revenues are expected to increase 25% per year as from
FY81, expect for FY84 when an additional increase of 15% is projected for
the same reasons as given for international telephone revenues (paragraph 4
above).
8.         Operating costs for operation and administration, mainly wages,
are expected to increase 15% per year (10% general inflation and 5% for
wage increase in real terms and increased staff).
9.         Maintenance costs are expected to nominally increase 10% per year
(remain about constant in real terms), as new efficient equipment will
require less maintenance than existing equipment (e.g., radio links versus
land lines).

ANNEX 17
Page 2 of 2 pages
10.       Depreciation has been calculated at the rate of 4.5% on year end
values of fixed assets in operation. Depreciation on revaluation
adjustments are included as from FY83.
11.       Interest has been projected at the rate of 13% on average
outstanding long-term debt for the year.
12.       Return on government equity has been projected at the rate of 13%
per year. As no return has been booked up to FY81, due to lack of
definition of the exact amount of government equity, a retroactive
adjustment of PRs 950 million has been projected in FY82 in addition to the
annual return of PRs 142.2 million.
13.       Transfer to Government Consolidated Fund are expected to cease as
from FY82 and T&T's surplus funds are projected to be accredited the
T&T-fund and shown as an asset in T&T's balance sheet. As transfers of
funds to government have been overstated up to FY81 by the accumulation of
interest under current liabilities, a retroactive adjustment of such
interest (PRs 1,345.6 million as of 6/30/81) has been projected for FY82.
Balance Sheet
14.       For the purposes of financial projections, T&T';: fixed assets in
operation have been revalued according to the whole sale index for
manufacture, up to f-Y81 and with 8% per year thereafter.  This is expected
to reasonably reflect the increase in current cost of T&T's fixed assets.
15.       Works in progress are expected to equal current years capital
expenditures (e.g., works are on an average completed within one and one
half years).
16.       Accounts receivalbe are assumed to equal two and one-half mont;hs
of billing.
17.       Inventories are assumed to increase only 10% per year taking into
consideration less maintenance needs for new assets.
18.       Accounts payable include accumulated interests on long-term debt
to government up to FY80. A retroactive adjustment is expected to be done
in FY82 (compare paragraph 13 above.
Funds Flow Statement
19.       As from FY83, T&T is expected to start repaying long-term  loans
from government over ten years, with one year of grace.
