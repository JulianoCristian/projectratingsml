Bank performance was\n            reasonably satisfactory, particularly in designing a package\n            which integrated monitoring, feeder roads, inputs, extension\n            and training. The Lofa I Project has had a smooth\n            organizational passage from conception to completion and a\n            few factors are the obvious contributors to this process.\n            The Government was eager to have an area based agricultural\n            project, to demonstrate in a concrete way its interest in\n            pursuing a policy of developing smallholder agriculture. The\n            Lofa County residents were already well known for their\n            industriousness and were actively interested in development\n            proposals. They were far enough away from the influence of\n            the city and were less suspicious of Government than farmers\n            in the areas with easy access to Monrovia. They were\n            therefore receptive to extension advice, supervision and\n            control of the Project. The semi-autonomous status of the\n            Project combined with a good management team, which\n            judiciously used this status, served to facilitate implementation."}, "docdt": "1983-05-27T00:00:00Z"}
