        responsibility.  It consists of the periodic maintenance and\n            technical assistance planned for the first three years of\n            the MOC's 1983/4-1986/7 main road maintenance program,\n            as well as the first year of its vehicle and equipment fleet\n            renewal program. Specifically, it provides for asphaltic\n            concrete overlay of existing pavement on about 160 miles of\n            roads; asphaltic sealing and resealing with double surface\n            treatment of some 360 miles of roads; and preparatory works\n            as well as the procurement of utility vehicles, dumptrucks,\n            and other equipment and about 245 man-months of technical\n            assistance to strengthen MOC's planning, maintenance\n            and equipment management and training capabilities."}, "docdt": "1983-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
