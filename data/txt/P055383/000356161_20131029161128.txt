F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project development objective is to improve standards of living of poor and vulnerable population
groups in Albania by: (i) increasing their access to well targeted and effective social care services; (ii)
assisting the Government to develop, monitor and evaluate more effective social policy; and (iii)
improving capacity for planning, managing and delivering social care services with increased
involvement of local governments, communities and civil society. The indicators specified in the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD) did not include targets, and a revised set of indicators and targets was agreed
with Government during the midterm review in May 2005, which was subsequently used to monitor
project performance.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The additional financing in March 2009 expanded the PDOs to encompass the scaled up activities. The
revised project development objective for the whole project, including portions to be supported by the
additional financing is: to improve the standards of living of poor and vulnerable groups in Albania by:
(a) increasing their access to effective social care services; (b) assisting the Government to develop
effective social care policy and improve its capacity for delivery and monitoring of social care services;
and (c) improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the pension system in Albania through (i) improving
pension system administration; (ii) institutional strengthening including improved capacity for pension
policy development; and (iii) improving public understanding of the pension system.

                  Revised target met. Given difficulties in initial implementation, at MTR it was decided to focus
                  the project in 8 regions. As of July 2013, 93 community daily care centers for social services
Comments          were operating across the country (of which 43 were established with financing by the project,
(incl. %          and 50 financed by government using the same model) and 52 residential care centers (of which
achievement)      14 were financed by the project). Nearly all these centers are operated as partnerships between
                  local NGOs and local governments, with sustainable financing now secured through local
                  governments.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design



1.       The project was approved by the Board of Directors on June 7, 2001 and became
effective on December 28, 2001. The project benefited from restructuring once on March 27,
2008 and one additional financing in the amount of USD $5 million on March 17, 2009. The
project closed on March 30, 2013.

1.1 Context at Appraisal


2.       Country and Sector Background: Albania's economy had experienced a series of
upward and downward fluctuations since the early 1990's. The country underwent a severe social
and economic crisis luring 1990-92 that led to a sharp fall in output, a rise in inflation, and a
significant increase in unemployment. Faced with the deteriorating economic situation, the
country launched a vigorous program of stabilization and structural reforms in the following three
years. The stabilization policies allowed the country to reduce macroeconomic imbalances and to
bring down the rate of inflation. The associated structural reforms focused on the privatization of
all shops, small enterprises, and agricultural land, the abolition of almost all price controls, the
establishment of a new legal framework for private ownership, and the liberalization of the trade
and payments regime. However, Albania then fell into near anarchy in early 1997, triggered by
the collapse of the Pyramid Scheme 1 that had absorbed a large portion of the financial assets of
the population. The related civil disorder led to severe disruptions in economic and social
activities. Output disruptions were extensive, especially in construction and industry. Trade
slowed down considerably and foreign aid and remittances (which were the major source of
foreign exchange) dropped sharply.

3.      To stabilize the economy, the government embarked on a recovery program during the
post-1997 crisis period, focusing on urgent macroeconomic and structural reform issues.
Implementation of these measures was highly successful and was the key to Albania's rapid
recovery from the crisis. The 1998 economic recovery was interrupted by civil disturbances
between opposing political parties culminated in civil unrest and subsequently in a change of
government in September 1998. The succeeding government quickly restored stability and
achieved considerable progress in implementing stabilization and structural reform measures.

4.       By the beginning of 1999, prior to project appraisal in February 2000, macroeconomic
stability had been restored and the structural reform program was progressing well. However,
later that year, the conflict in neighboring Kosovo created a massive influx of refugees, enormous
costs on the Albanian economy and an immediate threat to the government and the structural
reform program, as well as to the internal stability of Albania. However, the government, with the
help of donor community, managed this crisis successfully and with the repatriation of refugees it
focused on other serious development problems.

  A Pyramid Scheme is a non-sustainable business model that involves the exchange of money primarily
for enrolling other people into the scheme, usually without any product or service being delivered.

5.       Social Protection Sector-Related Issues: Successive governments since the early 2000s
(the time of appraisal) have been strongly committed to carrying out market reforms, and as part
of its comprehensive reform program the social protection system has been re-vamped with
administrative and political reforms. Governments have focused on improving the administration
of the social insurance system including old-age, disability and survivor's pensions, introduced
more open labor market policies, and introduced targeted poverty cash benefits (Ndihme
Ekonomike). Some capacity to implement social protection policies had been built (during the
civil unrest in 1997, when most of the country came to a halt, social insurance benefits continued
to be paid regularly). Accordingly, significant public resources were allocated to finance social
protection policies: 6.5 percent of GDP was spent on social insurance and social assistance in
cash programs in 1998. The social protection system played an important role in cushioning these
most difficult years of economic transition.

6.      These changes notwithstanding, institutional development and improvements in
governance capacity had generally lagged behind improvements in economic performance.
Economic and sector work findings had indicated that the social protection system in Albania
faced several key challenges, inter alia: (i) it was too large and incompatible with Albania's level
of income, and was inefficient and difficult to sustain financially; (ii) the efficiency and
effectiveness of the social assistance programs’ targeting needed to be improved (program data
showed that only one-third of beneficiaries classified as poor and two-thirds of current recipients
had been receiving assistance continuously since the program was introduced in 1993); (iii) social
care services and local safety nets programs were undeveloped and uncoordinated; (iv) capacity
to design, coordinate, administer, monitor and evaluate social protection programs was weak; (v)
functional and organizational capacity at all levels of the government that were responsible for
social protection policy implementation was underdeveloped; and (vi) human resources involved
in social protection policy design and implementation needed significant strengthening and
development.

7.       Rationale for Bank assistance. Poverty alleviation and human development were
identified as two strategic priorities of the 1998 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Albania.
The CAS progress report 2 presented to the Board on March 21, 2000 confirmed that these themes
remained fundamental and placed greater emphasis on social underpinning of poverty reduction.

8.       The project supported the CAS social protection sector objective to improve standards of
living through community-based social services targeted to poor and vulnerable population
groups. The project also contributed to the CAS objective of improving governance and
institution building by strengthening the capacity of the: (i) government to develop, monitor and
evaluate social policy; (ii) the social protection administration to plan, coordinate and monitor
social services; and (iii) local governments/communities, non-governmental institutions and civil
society to deliver those services. The project also aimed to: (i) strengthen the ability of the
statistical authorities to collect reliable household level data, and the capacity of government
agencies to evaluate that data in order to establish and implement an appropriate social protection
policy agenda; (ii) develop an institutional framework and policies for community-based social
services; (iii) improve capacities of central and local government for administration of
community-based social services; (iv) increase the number, variety and quality of locally-run
social services targeted to poor and vulnerable groups; and (v) increase involvement of local
communities and civil society and increase public awareness of vulnerability issues.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

9.      The project development objective from the PAD was to improve standards of living of
poor and vulnerable population groups in Albania by: (i) increasing their access to well-targeted
and effective social care services; and (ii) assisting the government to develop, monitor and
evaluate more effective social policy; and (iii) improving capacity for planning, managing and
delivering social care services with increased involvement of local governments, communities
and civil society. The legal agreement PDO was slightly different: “The objective of the Project is
to improve standards of living of the poor and vulnerable population of the Borrower through: (i)
increasing their access to effective social care services; and (ii) assisting the Borrower to develop
effective social care policy and improve its capacity for delivery and monitoring of social care
services.” This was resolved at the time of the Additional Financing (see section 1.3 below).

10.       Key Indicators from the PAD were: 3

      •   Policy and institutional framework for community-based social services to poor and
          vulnerable Groups developed and operational (capacity, financing, standards, guidelines,
          monitoring) by September 2004.
      •   Viable national replication plan developed by September 2004.
      •   Number of services operational in project targeted areas, providing good quality care,
          maintained and financially sustainable after investments completed (approximately115
          sub-projects).
      •   Increased participation of local governments, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs),
          community-based organizations (CBOs) and local communities in the decision making,
          provision and management of social services.
      •   Improved capacity of General Administration of Social Services (GASS) staff, local
          governments, NGOs, CBOs, and other organizations to deliver, monitor and manage
          services (monitoring system, regular data reports, publications, standards and guidelines
          etc).
      •   Increased public awareness of social inclusion issues of poor and vulnerable population
          groups, and increased numbers of people seeking referrals to social services.
      •   Government analysis and development of social policy at all stages (design, monitoring
          and evaluation) is improved, measured through qualitative assessments of policy
          performance by key stakeholders (e.g. Parliament, municipalities, NGO's, external
          development agencies).
      •   Introduction of a more reliable, timely and relevant household survey instrument for
          poverty monitoring and policy evaluation based on the 2001 population census and
          forthcoming Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS) and panel surveys.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

11.       The additional financing loan document dated February 23, 2009 revised the PDO as:




3
  In addition, the PAD included a very detailed logframe in Annex 1 with additional indicators. These
indicators were not included in the results framework of the ICR as only the above subset was indicated as
the key indicators in the text of the PAD and the rest were not used to monitor project implementation.

                                                    3
“To improve standards of living of poor and vulnerable population groups in Albania by: (i)
increasing their access to well-targeted and effective social care services; and (ii) assisting the
government to develop effective social care policy and improve its capacity for delivery and
monitoring of social care services; and (iii) improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the
pension system in Albania through: (a) improving pension system administration; (b) institutional
strengthening including improved capacity for pension policy development; and (c) improving
public understanding of the pension system.”

12.       The following key indicators were added with additional financing:

      •   Reduced number of documents required for applying for the pension benefits
      •   Number of days for providing formal response to pension applications (positive or
          negative) less than 30 days, on average.
      •   Increased number of contributors with individual records
      •   Increased number of beneficiaries with eligibility and benefits levels checked
      •   Increased number of SII staff trained in undertaking actuarial projections
      •   Increased number of people who know their pension rights
      •   Increased number of individuals/companies who indicate they have improved access to
          information about their benefits and contributions.

These indicators were added to monitor progress on the improvements of pension system
administration.

13.      Additional indicators and updated targets were added during mid-term review in May
2005; these were not formally incorporated into the legal agreement, but served as the basis for
subsequent project restructuring and were subsequently used to monitor project performance,.
This is discussed in further detail in section 1.7.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

14.      The PAD identified primary beneficiaries to include poor and vulnerable groups such as:
(i) children and youth at risk of abandoning school, and taking up crime, prostitution and/or
drugs; (ii) children without parental care and institutionalized children; (iii) single and abandoned
elderly; (iv) women heads of households and other marginalized population groups who are at
particular risk of social exclusion; and (v) communities these population groups belonged to.

15.      Secondary beneficiaries/target groups would be the: participating local governments;
NGOs; CBOs; central government institutions such as Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs
(MOLSA), GASS; and other civil society members who would benefit from training and
establishing the programs for the primary groups.

16.      The restructuring in March 2008 and additional loan financing of February
2009expanded the target group to all pensioners—those individuals eligible to benefit from the
social security system and the Social Insurance Institute as beneficiaries.

1.5 Original Components

The project consisted of four components as follows:

Component 1: Policy Development: US$ 1.6 million

This component consisted of three sub-components:

Sub-component 1: Poverty Monitoring and Evaluation -- US $ 0.7 million

17.     The project would support the national statistical agency (INSTAT) in the development
and implementation of new survey tools for the periodic production of the needed information
through provision of technical assistance, training and equipment. The project would also provide
the government with the necessary assistance towards the establishment and efficient functioning
of a Poverty Unit in the MOLSA for the analysis and dissemination of information for the
monitoring and evaluation of social programs. The training, Technical Assistance (TA), and some
equipment would be provided under this sub-component for the Poverty Unit.

Sub-component 2: Social Services Policy Development -- US $0.7 million

18.      The activities to be undertaken under this sub-component were expected to result in: a)
defined roles and responsibilities of central government agencies in national social care services;
b) MOLSA having the organizational and human capacity to develop appropriate social care
policy, c) an improved legislative and organizational framework for the management regulation
and delivery of social services, d) an operational system of standards, monitoring, and feedback
for social services, e) a more informed public on the problems of socially excluded groups and
the utility and availability of social services, and f) a sustainable system for financing social
services with incentives favoring community based services rather than institutional care.

19.    This sub-component would finance training and TA, study tours and other services. It
would be co-financed by DFID.

Sub-component 3: Strengthening the Development and Implementation of Pension Policy- - US
$0.2 million

20.      This sub-component would support TA in two areas: One involved developing policy
approaches for addressing, in an equitable and efficient way, inadequacies in the data base
available for pension administration. Those inadequacies included missing, inaccurate and
inaccessible historical data on individuals' work histories. The other involved examining
management and work processes within the Social Insurance Institute to identify ways to simplify
work flows and improve their efficiency. These forms of TA would complement a third TA
activity, outside the project, for which non-project financing had been obtained: namely,
extending past modeling of the pension system to refine projections of its performance under
present policies and to explore the implications of alternative approaches for addressing the main
policy challenges faced.

Component 2: Monitoring and Administration of Social Services: US $ 1.3 million

Sub-component 1: General Administration of Social Services -- US $0.9 million



                                                5
21.     This sub-component would finance training and TA, both formal (classes, seminars,
study tours) and informal (conferences, on-the-job training, site visits), to improve the central and
regional GASS's capacity to regulate and monitor community-based social services. At the
central GASS level, attention would be paid to building specific social service skills (developing
social services standards, guidelines, methodologies, policy implementation monitoring
mechanisms, and quality control mechanisms and criteria), as well as general management skills
(such as public outreach, planning and budgeting).

22.     Regional GASS offices would be assisted in developing business plans, enforcing social
service standards, quality control, monitoring techniques, effective social services administration
and outreach to the community. In addition, this sub-component would finance establishing of
the Management Information System (MIS) and case management system in the GASS, some
equipment for central and regional GASS offices, regional GASS offices renovations (civil
works) and vehicles to carry out project activities and monitoring functions.

Sub-component 2: Strengthening Capacity for Social Work Training -- US $0.4 million

23.      Training, TA, and consulting services would be financed under this sub-component to
support development of capacities for social work and case management training. Special
attention would be paid to developing the capacity of social service workers and trainers outside
of the Tirana area to deliver social service training. While activities in this sub-component would
target locally-based universities and other formal training institutions, it would also work to
develop the capacities of local NGOs and other social service providers to deliver training. As
part of the capacity development of local trainers, whenever possible, local facilities would be
used to "train the trainers."

Component 3: Community-Based Social Services: US$ 10.6 million

Sub-Component 1: Fund for Community-Based Social Services- - US $9.9 million

24.     Under this sub-component grants would be provided to the implementing agencies (e.g.
local government’s community-based organizations etc.) for establishing community-based social
services for targeted population groups based on the clearly defined criteria. Types of
community-based projects that could be financed through the project would include home
delivery programs for the elderly, battered women's shelters, youth centers, and facilities for
children such as day-care centers, and/or counseling services for vulnerable groups.

25.     This component would finance minor civil works, minor equipment, consultants’
services, training and TA and special programs. The funds for sub-projects would be pre-
allocated to all 12 regions of Albania using per-capita allocation method based on the population
numbers produced by the 2001 census.

Sub-component 2: Local Government and Social Service Provider Capacity Building - US $0.7
million

26.     This sub-component would finance training and TA for participating local governments
(bashki and communes) in order to strengthen their capacity to monitor, evaluate, publicize, and
administer social services. Separate training would also be provided to those local governments
who would be the actual implementers of community-based social services projects. As with
GASS capacity building, a combination of formal and informal training and technical assistance


                                                 6
would be used. To reflect the demand-driven nature of the project, individual training plans
would be developed on a case-by-case basis.


Component 4: Project Management, Information System and Monitoring: US$1.5 million

27.      This component would aim to ensure an efficient and effective implementation of project
activities, development of project Management Information System (MIS) and monitoring.

1.6 Revised Components

28.     Following the restructuring of the project in March 2008, new activities were included in
Subcomponents 1.1 and 1.3. The restructuring came about as a result of changing circumstances
and priorities of the Government as well as cost savings due to exchange rate fluctuations whilst
the project was performing well. These activities were also supported with the additional loan
financing of February 2009:

a. The Development of the SII Archive for Past Work Histories (US$2.1million). The project
would finance consultant services, goods and works needed for the development and
establishment of a centralized archive in the SII for all past contribution records, develop required
software and strengthen its capacity. The establishment of the archive would provide the SII with
a firm legal basis to determine and review pension cases and benefits.

b. The Development of a Detailed Action Plan for an Administrative Reform of the Albanian
Pension System (US$ 180,000). The project would finance consultant services needed for the
assessment and preparation of the outline of a detailed action plan for an administrative reform of
the Albanian pension system, as well as preparation of draft tender materials and contract
documents for a range of services including: (a) detailed design of the new business processes;
(b) design of technical specifications for the new IT system; (c) new hardware installation; (d)
new IT system implementation; and (e) training of the IT staff in new technologies and
applications.

c. Capacity building for the SII staff (US$ 180,000). The project would finance the most essential
training activities for the SII, with the focus on staff nominated to work in the archives.

d. Assistance in the development of an initial sample, review of the questionnaire and training of
surveyors for the LSMS (US$ 150,000). The project would finance consultant services needed for
the development of a representative sample and review of the questionnaire for the 2008 LSMS
as well as the development and implementation of training for the surveyors conducting the
LSMS.

29.     With the approval of additional financing in the amount of USD $5 million on March 17,
2009, the following was added as

Component 5: Pension System Reform

E. Project Management (US$ 200,000)

34.     This sub-component will aim to ensure an efficient and effective implementation of
project activities and monitoring, through financing services and incremental operating costs for
the project management unit

1.7 Other significant changes

35.     With the changes to the scope of the project introduced with the restructuring followed by
the additional financing, the responsibility for the implementation of activities on the social
pension system (sub-components 1.1 and 1.3) was transferred to the Social Insurance Institute
under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance. In addition, there were changes in: (i) the
project implementation schedule; (ii) funding allocation; and (iii) outcome and intermediate
outcome indicators were also added (see below).

(i) Project Implementation Schedule: The closing date of the project was extended once by 18
months from March 31, 2008 to September 30, 2009, in order to complete the new activities
introduced after the project’s restructuring in March 2008. An additional financing was approved
on February 23, 2009 extending the implementation period until September 30, 2012. A final
extension of six months was approved in July 25, 2012 to ensure completion of key activities that
would make the SII operational. The project closed on March 31, 2013.

(ii) Funding allocations: During implementation, the Credit Agreement was amended as
explained below:

36.     First Reallocation. In May 2005, the uncommitted funds of US$620,000 were re-
allocated from Component 3 to Components 1 and 4. The following activities were agreed to
provide additional support, in line with the PDO: (i) to continue supporting the poverty
monitoring unit (under MOLSA) which has lead responsibility for the evaluation of MOLSA
policy outcomes; (ii) to continue supporting institutionalizing the system of household surveys for
poverty monitoring at INSTAT; and (iii) pension reform on modeling administrative and financial
systems. Since the amount to be reallocated was below 10 percent of the total loan, there was no
formal re-structuring required and the re-allocation was recorded in the Aide Memoire for the
Mid-Term Review.

37.     Second Reallocation: Within the framework of the restructuring in March 2008, the cost
savings of $2.7 million (due to exchange rate fluctuations) was reallocated towards new activities
under:

38.      Subcomponent 1.3 Strengthening the Development and Implementation of Pension Policy
for: (i) implementing an urgent rehabilitation and modernization of the pension archives, to
prevent loss of documentation utilized in an ongoing review exercise to improve governance and
transparency of pension benefits; (ii) developing a detailed action plan for administrative reforms
of the pension system; (iii) capacity building for SII staff including on new archiving software;
and

39.     Subcomponent 1.1 Poverty Monitoring and Evaluation for (iv) technical assistance to
support the 2008 Living Standards Measurement Survey.

40.    Additional Financing: Following the approval of additional financing on March 17, 2009,
USD $5 million was allocated to activities under the new component 5 for Pensions Systems
Reform.

(iii) Additional Indicators: Since 2001, when the PAD was drafted, project results monitoring
methodology has improved significantly in the Bank. To align the project with these changes and
to better track project implementation, targets were set and a number of indicators were changed,
improved and added at different stages of project implementation at mid-term review and with re-
structuring and additional financing.

41.      The Mid-Term Review in May 2005 set a mix of additional indicators and targets for
existing indicators for the project. These indicators were not formally recorded through a
restructuring but were agreed with the client and recorded in the Aide Memoire for the Mid-Term
Review:




                                                10

        have the capacity to fulfill these responsibilities effectively: target: 80% of municipalities
        in at least 8 regions by February 2008.

43.     The restructuring in March 2008 entailed adding the following additional outcome
indicators to monitor the implementation of activities under Sub-components 1.1 and 1.3:

      (i)      increased capacity of SII to detect and reduce fraud in the system via securing all of
               the historical contribution and work history records, compared to the one quarter

                    access to information about their benefits and contributions


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

45.      During preparation, the project design took into account lessons learned from previous
Bank-assisted projects in the social sector in Albania. A number of alternative options such as
adding components to existing social protection investment lending operations was considered
but rejected given that they did not allow for longer-term solutions to improve social services and
social assistance and the institution building envisioned for MOLSA. Likewise, the design
considered the risk factors, and appropriate measures were adopted to mitigate all major risks
identified at appraisal. The project also provided a participatory framework involving
stakeholders and direct beneficiaries in the decision-making processes.

Lessons learned from previous Bank-assisted projects

46.     This project was built on the experience accumulated and lessons learned in Albania
through implementation of various Bank-financed projects since 1992. In particular, the lessons
learned from two social protection projects (Labor Market and Social Safety Net Development
projects), which included the following:

    •       Insist on government co-financing early in the project in order to encourage sustainability
    •       Keep realistic expectations regarding project impact and institutional development

                                                    12
    •   Shield project coordination unit staff from political influence whenever possible
    •   Design projects in accordance to government’s institutional capacity
    •   Use public information campaigns to heighten issue awareness
    •   Local co-financing can help ensure that projects are truly owned and demanded by
        communities
    •   Work with the government to keep staff turnover to a minimum
    •   Continuous evaluation is key for any poverty/vulnerability alleviation program;
    •   Adapt project management structure to the government institutional structure in place,
        and ensure adequate coordination among implementing agencies and agencies conducting
        related programs.

47.      In addition, the social and beneficiary assessments carried out under completed and
ongoing operations such as Community Works, Urban Works and Micro-credit Project of
Albania Development Fund, Irrigation Rehabilitation Project (Women in Development
Component), Urban Land Management Project had pointed out that successful operations focus
on: (i) implementation capacity of government, PCUs and non-governmental organizations; (ii)
participation at local level; and (iii) building in the transparency and accountability mechanisms
to address the issues of corruption and capture.

48.      The project was built upon these lessons and incorporated them into the project design
through: (i) focusing on building the capacity of the PCU and implementing agencies (MOLSA,
GASS, INSTAT etc.) and ensuring that the proper systems and capacity for fiduciary
responsibilities were built prior to beginning of project implementation (ii) investing heavily in
system and policy development and building necessary institutional framework and capacity; (iii)
investing in development of adequate monitoring and evaluation systems; and (iv) phasing the
project implementation and scaling up slowly once the adequate policy and institutional capacity
was developed.

Risks and Risk Mitigation Measures

49.    The table below shows the risks and mitigation measures identified in the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD) and additional financing document along with a brief commentary on
how the risks evolved during implementation.

                                                                    fraudulent pension claims. By
                                                                    developing the online payment
                                                                    system, SSI was able to eliminate
                                                                    the continued payment of
                                                                    pensions after death or payments
                                                                    above the benefit amount
                                                                    calculated by SII.

Adequacy of participatory processes

50.      The Steering Committee (SC), the main decision making body of the project, included
representatives of different groups of society. Fifty percent of the SC members represented
government organizations, including MOLSA, GASS, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Public
Order, local government representative (Mayor of Tirana) and 50% represented non-
governmental organizations, including the Soros Albania Foundation, a public representative,
UNICEF, an international NGO, and a donor organization. Regional workshops were undertaken
in the four pilot areas (Tirana, Vlora, Durres and Shkodra) with social workers and academics,
NGOs, local government representatives, and local GASS staff to discuss the findings of the
Vulnerability Needs and Institutional Capabilities Assessment (VNICA) and project objectives.
Participatory appraisal workshop with over 100 participants was organized by the government
during the project appraisal mission to discuss and agree on project objectives, components and
activities.

51.     The primary beneficiaries, such as vulnerable and marginalized community members,
including youth at risk, children without parental care and institutionalized children, single and
abandoned elderly, and women heads of households, were consulted extensively through the
VNICA study.

52.      Consultation and collaboration with NGOs was achieved in three ways: (i) the presence
of an NGO representative on the SSDP Steering Committee; (ii) consultation with local and
international NGOs during Bank missions and in the course of the VNICA study to learn more
about their programs and clients; and (iii) the eligibility of Albanian NGOs to apply for sub-
project funding. Finally, under the new social assistance and social services law NGOs can
become licensed social service providers.

2.2 Implementation


53.     Midterm Review: The Bank conducted a Midterm Review (MTR) in May 2005, and
reviewed the project’s progress towards its development objective and the status of MTR targets.
A number of issues were identified, which required immediate attention by the government. In
particular, as no mutually agreed upon outcome indicators with clear targets were in place until
the MTR mission, the government and the task team agreed on a set of outcome indicators which
were henceforth monitored to ensure progress towards meeting the development objective. In
addition: (i) an agreement was reached on developing a detailed and viable financing strategy for
social care services which is expected to clearly outline the path of decentralized service delivery

                                                17
and its financing; and (ii) a better alignment of the sub-projects with the government strategy and
action plan was also agreed. This was expected to ensure that local governments define priorities
and align the new services with the overall government strategy. In addition, agreement was
reached to expand project support only in 4 more regions in the country (totaling 8 regions).
Although the project implementation was considered successful at the MTR point, the challenges
faced during implementation and the delays in the first phase influenced the decision to limit the
number of regions to be supported during the second phase of implementation.

54.      Restructuring: The project was restructured in March 2008, in response to the
government’s proposal to use the cost savings of US$ 2.7 million (resulting from fluctuations of
international exchange rates) to undertake: (i) an urgent rehabilitation and modernization of the
pension archives and obtain basic required software to prevent loss of work-history data and
documentation, (ii) develop a detailed outline of the overall administrative reform of Albanian
pension system; and (iii) assist in the development of initial sample, review of the questionnaire,
and training of surveyors for the 2008 LSMS. (Please refer to section 1.7 for discussion of the
updated indicators.) This was a timely response to the government’s priority regarding the
acceleration of administrative reform in order to improve governance and transparency and
achieve costs savings in the pension system.

55.   The restructuring expanded activities which, under the original project design, fell under
subcomponents 1.1 and 1.3. For details, see Section 1.6.

56.      Additional Financing: In response to the government’s request for support to their
pension system administration reform, additional financing was approved in the amount of USD
$5 million on March 17, 2009 with the objective of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of
the pension system in Albania through: (a) improving pension system administration; (b)
institutional strengthening including improved capacity for pension policy development; and (c)
improving public understanding of the pension system.

57.      The project was at risk twice during implementation, first in 2004 and again in 2006,
because of the: (i) weak project management and frequent change of project director; (ii) delay in
starting implementation in all components, including starting of British Council work under
DFID; delay in approving the Law of Decentralization because of the change in government.

58.     Factors affecting project implementation: The project implementation had suffered
considerable delays since the project start. The main reasons can be grouped as following:


    • Severe delays in the adoption and implementation of decentralization strategy for social
services. The project was designed to support and go in line with the implementation of the
decentralization process in the country. It was clearly based on the Law of the Autonomy of
Local Government, approved by the Parliament in August 2000. However, the operationalization
of decentralized social service delivery took much longer than expected. Specifically, the Law on
Social Assistance and Services was finally prepared in summer 2004 and got approved only in
April 2005 by the Parliament. Similarly, the National Strategy for Social Services was approved
only in March 2005. These documents spelled out the clear distribution of roles and
responsibilities between central and local government for social services.


    • Project management issues. (a) During the project period, PCU had a high turnover of
project managers. Altogether, there were five project managers, and very often, there were long

                                                18
time gaps between different project managers. In addition, there was also a high turnover of PCU
staff.; (b) In the beginning of the project, there was lack of capacity in MOLSA to manage large
and complex projects; (c) There were various procurement issues, including delays in the
procurement of the technical assistance (supported by DFID), contracting in general, procurement
of goods and filing; and (d) minor financial management issues. The financial management and
procurement specialists have been trained regularly by the World Bank through project support.
The PCU staff has also participated in study visits related to decentralized social service delivery.

     • The transfer of ownership for the state owned buildings, from the central to the local
level, affected quite negatively the implementation of the social services subprojects (under
Component 3). Most of the approved sub projects included civil works for rehabilitating the
buildings where the services were to be delivered. The transfer of the ownership took so long that
it postponed the project implementation for more than 18 months.

     • Staff turnover. The project covered a number of areas and, since the beginning of its
implementation, had appointed senior staff from MOLSA as coordinators per each project
component. Between 2003 and 2006, the Ministry had undergone several changes at senior level
staff. As result, a number of component coordinators were replaced. This had negatively
affected the implementation pace of different project components and coordination of their
activities.

   • Local government capacity was weak. Considerable support was given under the project
(DFID financing) for capacity building at central and, especially local level. However, this
remained a clear bottleneck for project implementation.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

59.     M&E design: The project originally planned for proper monitoring and evaluation to
assess progress in meeting the project implementation targets and objectives at both the national
and local level. At the national level, it was planned to have a monitoring and evaluation unit in
the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) that would monitor and evaluate overall project progress,
including an impact evaluation of the social assistance reform in a few pilot sites to determine
whether access to social care services has improved. A Poverty Monitoring Unit was also planned
under the Ministry of Labor and tasked with doing poverty data analysis to contribute to policy
making. At the local level, each community-based sub-project was to have monitoring indicators
and an evaluation plan incorporated into project design. The monitoring was planned to be carried
out by the social services officers of GASS regional and central offices based on the norms and
standards and in conformity with monitoring indicators outlined in individual contracts. A results
framework was developed and a plan agreed for baseline and monitoring data collection. Finally,
a monitoring system with pre-formatted reports was planned for recipients to provide feedback.

60.      Although, the PAD had put forth a logical framework for project monitoring, it had not
identified measurable and clear outcome indicators and targets. This was not done until the Mid-
Term Review where indicators were clarified, some added and baseline and targets defined.
During implementation, additional monitoring indicators were added to the results framework to
track the changes introduced to project design, although were not recorded in a formal
restructuring (as was common practice at the time). One single M&E framework, however, was
never articulated and thus a mix of indicators was tracked throughout the project instead of a
comprehensive framework. The project strengthened overall poverty monitoring, but did not



                                                 19
undertake specific impact evaluations on key interventions. This and available data at project
completion indicates that the M&E design was partially successful.

61.     M&E implementation and utilization: MOLSA has regularly collected data on
indicators included in the results framework. During implementation, staff from the State Social
Services Inspectorate also visited field centers to monitor the quality of services rendered by
municipalities and other local governments, NGOs, and community centers, and their compliance
with the regulations and standards. In addition, mini surveys were conducted in daily care and
residential centers to assess the situation in these places at the beginning of the project, during the
MTR stage, and at the end of the project. However, an independent impact evaluation of
improvements on social service delivery; i.e. access and performance has been conducted.

62.      At the national level, appropriate data collected from the MOLSA Directorate of Policy
Unit’s regional offices were evaluated and used to inform decision-making on activities such as
settling property transfers between the national and local governments; beneficiaries; civil works;
and supplying furniture etc. Administrative data available from social service centers and
collected by SSS was also used in making decisions such as transferring beneficiaries to other
centers. A Poverty Monitoring Unit (PMU) was also established under the Ministry of Labor and
tasked with doing poverty data analysis to contribute to policy making. Capacity of this PMU was
built through project resources. The PMU supported the updates of poverty maps and use of this
data for better geographic targeting of resources under social assistance and social services.
Finally, the Social Policies Department under the Ministry of Labor (MoLSAEO) monitors
implementation of the objectives of the social services strategy and reports on the status to to the
Department of Forign Aid Coordination and Strategy Monitoring under the Council of Ministers.
The PCU, however, was not able to fulfill its responsibilities to monitor and evaluate overall
project progress.

63.     At the local level, the daily care centers regularly collect data, including number of
beneficiaries, feedback from beneficiaries and inspectors. They then report to the local
government and the local government sends the information to SSS.


2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

64.      There were no significant deviations or waivers from the Bank safeguards and fiduciary
policies and procedures during the implementation of the project.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase


65.      An adequate institutional, financial and technical framework is in place for the
continuation of project activities. Law number 9355 on reform of social services was approved in
March 2005 and outlines the responsibilities of central and local government’s vis-à-vis provision
of social services and sources of financing for the services. The law stipulates that social care
services financed by local governments can be public or private. Public social care services can
be provided in residential, day care and home facilities. These services shall be funded by the
central budget and independent budgets of local government units. The law also stipulates that
municipalities/communes will manage all social services for the residents of the
municipality/commune. Also included in the 2005 law and 2011 Social Inclusion Law are
processes and standards to ensure the financial sustainability of local social services, including 1)
clear responsibilities between SSS and local governments, 2) a requirement for a 5% contingency

                                                  20
in MoLSAEO for unforeseen needs and criteria for distributing these funds, 3) standards for when
local governments in need can apply for national funds, and 4) cost standards for services (food,
staff salaries and ratios, etc.).

66.     As per the 2005/2011 laws on social services and social assistance reform, institutional
and funding arrangements at local and regional levels are already in place and well established to
continue the operation of community and residential centers offering social services. Social
services previously offered with project support will be continued by most of the local
governments with their own financial resources. Those local government units which do not have
adequate funds to maintain their social services can access funding through a special fund
financed from the national budget for this purpose. Regional social service plans, which define
the needs and the type services to be provided, continue to be updated annually.

67.        As of July 2013, 100% of the social service centers supported with project funding are
operational. This means that they have a full complement of staff and work at capacity. Site
visits 4 to a number of community centers confirmed the fact that centers are run with local and/or
central government financing and are able to retain full complement of staff. The titles for the
residential and daily care center buildings have already been transferred from central government
to local governments. Local governments have also signed social service delivery agreements
with local NGOs, and they will be monitoring the activities of these NGOs.

68.      MOLSA, especially SSS staff, have benefited from the training, study tours, and
workshops financed under the project, especially in terms of new laws and standards. This
capacity is expected to be sustainable, even if there may be change of administrations. Staff and
management working in local governments and NGOs are mostly well trained and qualified to
assume their responsibilities. Further, the national government has put in place adequate and
favorable policies required for effective operation and maintenance of social services. For
example, standards of social services for children, elderly and disabled people, and human
trafficking victims have already been clearly defined under the 2005 law and measures against
non-compliance articulated in the 2011 law. Within this legal and institutional framework, local
governments and service providers are well-equipped to sustain project supported activities.

69.     State Social Services (SSS) is also fully staffed and operational. It is considered one of
the high capacity technical units within the administration. Each SSS local office has a staff
dedicated to monitoring and implementing the local social care plans and services.

70.     In light of ongoing work on pension reforms and government commitment to make the
pension system fiscally sustainable, SII will continue to be a strong technical unit. The
government is currently exploring different reform options to improve coverage, other design
aspects and sustainability of the pension system through Bank technical assistance.

71.     Sustainability of the M&E arrangements: MOLSA has established M&E arrangements
with clear institutional responsibilities to collect administrative data and assess adherence to
service standards. 5 The Government continues to monitor its social care services by using a set of

service and performance standards developed under the project. These have to do with: (i)
service standards for children in residential and day care institutions; (ii) service standards for
elderly in residential centers; (iii) service standards for elderly in daycare centers; and (iv) service
standards for victims of trafficking. Regional SSS offices report on a set of basic indicators which
include adherence to general and specific service standards related to the operation of the centers
and state of social services. Institutions are assessed on the quality of services provided,
adequacy of staff, work environment, health and safety and other. Although the Directorate of
Social Services is mandated to inspect each facility at least twice a year, with current staffing
levels they are only able to carry them out in one third of the facilities. The SII also tracks
administrative data including service standards, number of beneficiaries, contributors and other.
Sustainability of the M&E arrangements is moderate.


Follow-up project by the Bank

72.     The Government of Albania has a very strong dialogue with the World Bank on social
protection and in particular on safety nets. There is an ongoing project --Social Assistance
Modernization Project (P122233) -- which focuses on strengthening the administrative delivery
systems (such as targeting, beneficiary registration and tracking and developing an MIS) of safety
nets. The Bank also supported a Social Sector Reform Development Policy Loan (P116937)
which financed reforms to improve effectiveness and efficiency of safety nets and health sector
spending.

73.     An ongoing pensions TA is developing a new policy note on pensions. Following the
completion and dissemination of this policy note, the World Bank is likely to continue providing
technical assistance to the Government in this domain.

Suggested priority and optimum timing of any future impact evaluation

74.      It will be important to conduct an evaluation about a year after project closure in order to
assess the quality of social services, and how the local governments and MOLSA are sustaining
the social service centers in the absence of external funding. The MOLSA on an annual basis
reports on the implementation of the social protection strategy to the Department of Coordination
in the Prime Minister’s office. Similarly, it would be interesting to do a process evaluation of the
pension administration system to assess the efficiency gains and the functionality of the MIS
system.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation


75.     The objectives of the project were and remain highly relevant, and are in line with
Albania’s previous and current social and economic realities, policy priorities and the country’s
National Strategy for the Socio-Economic Development (NSSED(Please refer to Section 1.1-
Context at Appraisal for a discussion of alignment with the World Bank CAS).The project
objective is also fully in line with the government’s National Strategy for Social Services
(approved by the Council of Ministers in April 2005), the Law on Social Assistance and Social
Services (approved by the Parliament and enacted in April 2005), and the updated Law on Social



                                                  22
Assistance and Social Services (approved by the Parliament and enacted in March 2011). The
overall relevance of the Project’s Objectives is therefore rated as High.

76.      The project design addressed key priorities to strengthen social services in Albania, and
responded to changing demographics and corresponding needs of the country's social sector and
the desire for reforming, realigning the sector with the country’s political and economic
liberalization in the 1990s and early 2000. With changing household and extended family
dynamics and migration patterns, vulnerable groups such as the elderly have been on the rise.
Likewise, there is an increasing number of: (i) youth at risk because of drug and alcohol abuse;
and (ii) HIV/AIDS-affected people. In addition, disabled and handicapped children, and women
at risk are also in need of social services. Similarly, the country’s pension system which was
characterized by high levels of fraud and decreasing contributions due to changing demographics
was in dire need of reform and strengthening to minimize the fiscal drain and to become more
effective. The choice of project components and activities to be supported reflected these needs
very well, and the project struck a balance between support for specific investments to address
key issues, and support for key policy reforms to sustain investments. The choice of instrument,
specific investment loan, was also the most suitable one to provide the kind of wide ranging
capacity development to key institutions involved in policy making, planning and implementation
of social assistance, social services and pensions. The size of loan proved to be adequate over the
original project period. The main design shortcomings were (i) the weakness in the projects
Results Framework, including definition of indicators and targets (see discussion above); (ii)
excessive optimism at the likely pace of reform implementation. Overall design relevance is
rated as Modest.


3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

77.     The project’s overall efficacy in achievement of project development objectives is
assessed as moderately satisfactory. First, the project fully achieved 20 out of 24 PDO Indicators
(with the remaining four either partially achieved or lacking adequate data), and 9 out of 12
intermediate indicators were fully met, with 3 partially met. Second, of the specific development
objectives (see below), 2 were fully satisfactory, 2 were partially achieved.

78.      The revised indicators as per the mid-review, restructuring and additional financing
clarified the linkages between projects and outcomes and made it easier to assess project
implementation performance and achievement of the PDO.

79.      The project supported service delivery in 43 daily care centers and 14 residential care
centers, offering services under newly developed service standards and policies to more than
25,000 clients, and commendable and adequate efforts have been made by the central government
and local governments to ensure their sustainability after project closure. Quality and quantity of
community services have doubled between 2003 and 2009. The spatial distribution of services
has also improved with the expansion of services to eight regions and two municipalities6. As a
result, geographic areas with large concentrations of vulnerable people have an increased and
improved array of social services. The MOLSA and SII are now better equipped institutions to
influence and drive the policy making agendas in social assistance and social services and as well
as to administer and provide more efficient services.

80.    Original Objective (i) Increasing the access of poor and vulnerable population
groups, to well- targeted and effective social care services.

Achievement of this objective is Satisfactory.

81.      In October 2006, it was agreed that the operational definition of the indicator measuring
access would be “increase in the capacity (i.e. number of places/units of service provided).”
According to this definition, capacity was clearly increased by the increased number of centers
and number of services offered. The project targeted increased services/access by supporting 115
social service sub-projects. This target was surpassed with 145 social service sub-projects
delivered across the 8 targeted regions (See Results Framework). The number of social care
services provided directly to clients, compared to information and advisory services, doubled over
the project period 7. The project also supported establishment of 43 daily care centers targeting
vulnerable groups (youth at risk, people with disabilities, women and elderly) and improvements
in 14 residential care centers.

82.       There is also strong evidence that quality of these services also increased:

      •   Standards for service delivery were established through technical assistance and are now
          monitored by the State Social Inspectorate. The updated March 2011 social assistance
          and services law also establishes penalties for bribery of inspectors and/or failure to
          comply with the social service standards.
      •   Implementation of these standards has been very positive including: development of
          guidelines and manuals to implement the service standards, continuous training on the
          service standards is to local governments and other services providers, sharing of
          experience and best practices.
      •   The staff to beneficiary ratio in one residential center visited by the ICR team was 1.5
          residents per 1 staff. The estimated national average for beneficiary to staff ratios in
          elderly care centers based on 5 regions is 3.2 to 1.

a. Daily care centers. With the support of the project, there are 43 daily care centers offering a
variety of social services. These services are located in eight main regions of the country and two
municipalities (included during the second phase of the project implementation).

83.      Main vulnerable groups benefiting from the daily community-based social services are:
(i) children (12%); (ii) youth at risk (36%); (iii) disabled (5%); (iv) women and families without
support (29%), and (v) elderly (24%). The services cover almost 2/3 of the country’s territory,
where 80% of the population lives. Beneficiaries are selected by eligibility criteria, which
determines their level of need and which is mandated under the Law on Social Assistance and
Social Services. These criteria were further improved with the updated March 2011 law.

84.    In addition, there were indirect beneficiaries those who participated in the project but
were not direct recipients, such as care providers and families, whose numbers were about twice
as many as beneficiaries.

b. Residential services: Apart from the support given to the daily care centers, the project offered
significant support to residential services. Residential care services were included under the
project in 2006 following the MTR and extensive discussion with authorities , with the aim of (i)
improving the quality of care in the existing residential services, according to the newly
established service standards; and (ii) developing a transformation strategy for these centers, in
line with the local government needs/plans.

Development Plans and Implementation

85.     Development plans were prepared for all the existing residential centers. Detailed designs
were developed for the main 13 residential care centers (which were defined as priority centers by
MOLSA). These improved designs ensured compliance with the new standards through the
following:

    1. Partial or full rehabilitation of the buildings
    2. Re-organization of the center according to the results/suggestions in the development plans.
         For example, combining daily care with residential care services.

86.      Due to funding limitations, MOLSA selected five residential centers, which were fully
rehabilitated and supplied with furniture under the project:

      •   Elderly center in Kavaja,
      •   Disabled center in Durres,
      •   Center for development in Shkoder,
      •   Children center in Shkoder,
      •   Elderly center in Tirana.

 Refers to the period between 2005-2009 when the project was expanded to four additional district and two
municipalities as mentioned elsewhere in the text.

                                                   25
87.      The remaining centers were supplied with furniture and equipment (such as computers,
copiers, etc.) as per the standards.

88.     Some plans included establishing daily care centers within the residential centers. 10
daily care centers have been established within existing residential ones (for children, disabled
and elderly groups).

89.     Overall, the main impact of this support was the significant improvement of the quality of
services, in line with the new standards10.

Transfer of all residential care centers to local government units

90.     Project activities for the residential centers also included decentralization and transfer of
ownership of residential care centers to local government units. This transfer has put all the
buildings under the administration of the local units of the State Social Services agency (SSS).
From 2006 to 2007, there were 19 residential care centers transferred from the SSS to the local
government units, which currently are responsible for their management/administration.

91.       The transfer to the local government units was accompanied by:

      •   transfer of ownership of the respective buildings, from the SSS to the local government
          units;
      •   transfer of ownership of whole inventory of furniture and equipment of the residential
          care centers to the local government units;
      •   the annual conditional transfer of funds from the MOLSA to local government units for
          financing of activities in these centers; and
      •   transfer of all staff of social workers to local government management.

92.     New rules and regulations regarding the administration of the residential care centers are
currently in place and under implementation.

93.      The transfer process also brings certain obligations for the local government: (i)
responsibility to keep the same nature of services offered in these centers; (ii) responsibility for
the ownership of the buildings; (iii) appropriate use of conditional financing from MOLSA; and
(iv) hiring and staff development based on criteria approved by Council of Ministers for social
workers.

c. New Standards for all vulnerable categories

94.      With project support, in October 2005 the following standards were approved and
operationalized by the Council of Ministers (COM): (i) general standards of social services, and
(ii) standards for children at the residential care centers. In 2006, service standards for all the
other vulnerable groups were produced: (i) disabled people, (ii) elderly, (iii) women as vulnerable
group, and (iv) children in general.

95.     The process of producing the new standards was widely participatory. The project also
trained stakeholders on their use, as well as publicized all related documents (See “Original


10
  Each regional SSS office produces monthly monitoring reports on basic operations and adherence to
service standards which are sent to the main office and then to MOLSA.

                                                 26
Objective iii” below for more details). These standards are applied now in all the service centers
and have standardized and improved the quality of social services offered11 .

d. Licensing of public and private bodies which offer social services

96.     One of the main requirements introduced by the Law on Social Services and Assistance
was the official process of licensing all service providers. In 2006, there were 55 NGOs licensed
which increased to 85 in 2007. Currently, there 183 licensed public and private entities. The
licensing process is a continuous process with re-licensing required periodically. This was a
crucial step towards establishing an institutional relationship between the MOLSA/SSS and the
NGOs, as well as for improving the quality of services delivered.

97.     With licenses NGOs were able to mobilize resources from local government and donors.
Licensed NGOs have become reliable partners for the government in the delivery of quality social
care services and strategy and policy development.

98.      Overall, the delivery of services in all 43 centers is considered satisfactory and in line
with the newly established standards of social care. The daily care centers, established under the
project, are highly appreciated by stakeholders. The community based service delivery model and
philosophy introduced by SSDP has been replicated by several local governments. A clear
example of this success is the municipality of Tirana. While implementing seven sub-
projects/services established under the project, the municipality of Tirana expanded the number
of social services adding another eight social service projects built upon the model introduced by
the SSDP.

99.     This model has become the backbone of social care in Albania and the number of
community centers has multiplied since 2003. The total number of community service centers
has increased to 93 since the completion of World Bank support in 2008.


Original Objective (ii) Assisting the Government to develop, monitor and evaluate effective
social policy

Achievement of this objective is Moderately Satisfactory.

a. Develop Social Policy

     i.     Preparation and approval of the ‘Law on Social Services and Assistance’, approved
            in March 2005:

100.    Preparation of the above mentioned law was among the first results produced under the
project. Within a relatively short period of time, this Law was accompanied by 38 sub-laws and
published as a full package. The legal package was then distributed to all involved stakeholders.
On this basis, all the stakeholders in the social services area started to apply the new legal
framework.




11
  Details of performance by each center and adherence to service standards can be found in the monthly
SSS reports.

                                                 27
101.    The law was then updated in March 2011 and strengthened and improved the previous
law, including:

    •     expanding social assistance to additional vulnerable groups,
    •     strengthening penalties for non-compliance with social services standards,
    •     improving the cash social assistance targeting methodology, and
    •     establishing a national electronic registry for cash social assistance beneficiaries.

102.     In addition, the national strategy of social services was prepared and approved with
project support. This strategy put in place a framework for implementing all social services. The
law and the social services strategy also contributed to the development of the 2008-2013 Social
Protection Strategy. This strategy identified expansion of community services and continued
quality of existing services as a priority.

    ii.       New responsibilities of the central and local government units for the
              administration of social services.

103.     Following the approval of the Law on Social Services and Social Assistance, the MOLSA
started transferring responsibilities from central to local government units. Under the new
arrangements, MOLSA remains responsible for: (i) defining social policies at national level; (ii)
monitoring the legislation’s implementation; (iii) defining the national social services, disability
and cash social assistance budget and assigning the required funds to the local governments; (iv)
issuing licenses to service providers; and (vi) defining the national standards for social services.

104.    The State Social Services agency – SSS (previously the General Agency for Social
Services) is an intermediate institution between the policy-making level (MOLSA) and local
governments (as implementing agency). As such, the SSS is responsible for the following: (i)
assessing and planning cash social assistance programs; (ii) monitoring implementation of social
services according to national standards; (iii) implementing legislation, and (iv) identifying
capacity building needs of central and local staff.

105.     Local Government Units are responsible for: (i) identifying eligible vulnerable
individuals and families and defining the financial support needed; (ii) establishing new social
services in accordance with the needs of the community; (iii) administering the residential care
centers as well as the daily ones; (iv) selecting service providers to deliver social services; and (v)
distributing cash social assistance and disability benefits.

b. Monitor and Evaluate Social Care Services

106.    Under the DFID technical assistance, guidelines on monitoring and evaluating social
services and performance indicators were developed. Rules for financial monitoring and reporting
were also developed. Finally, a Monitoring and Evaluation Working Group on Performance
Indicators was set up under MOLSAEO. The poverty monitoring unit under MOLSAEO,
however, was not able to carry out its full M&E function to evaluate achievements of the
development objectives. Instead, it was agreed to focus the work of the Unit on carrying out
specific studies on the impact of social policies introduced. The PCU carried out few studies
which considerably helped MOLSA in decision making, especially related with the Ndihme
Ekonomike (NE) issues (analyses per selected regions). Also, the PCU contributed in the overall
National Strategy for Economic development, covering all areas under MOLSA supervision (such
as NE, social services, social inclusion, etc.).


                                                   28
107.     Data provision: The project helped institutionalize regular, household based data
collection. A national LSMS was conducted in 2002, 2005 and 2008. These contributed to the
measurement of internationally recognized poverty indicators and comparison of data between
periods. In addition, the established system includes yearly surveys focusing on special topics
such as poverty, unemployment, and migration. In addition, there are now conferences,
publications, etc. that share experience and dialogue between producers of information (INSTAT)
and users of information such as policymakers, NGO, universities, etc. The project built up data
processing and analysis capacities within government structures allows them to use and benefit
from the statistical information produced by INSTAT. A successful example of use of this
information is the design of sectoral strategies and National Strategy for Social and Economic
Development (NSSED). Another example is the 2005 DFID supported policy impact analysis. In
this study, the Programming, Monitoring and Analysis Sector (PMU) looked at the allocation of
block grants for cash transfers distributed by communes and municipalities. It reached a number
of conclusions and examined implications of different policies as well as recommended
improvements for NE.

108.     The project also supported the Household Budget Survey (HBS) in 2007. This gave
further support to collection and analyses of poverty data at household level.

Original Objective (iii) Improving capacity for planning, managing and delivering social
care services with increased involvement of local governments, communities and civil
society

Achievement of this objective is Moderately Satisfactory.

109.     Through technical assistance under the project, funded by DFID, the British Council was
hired to carry out a number of capacity building projects. They assisted MOLSA leadership with
the policy and legislative framework design, assisted local governments with developing
community care plans, and delivered trainings both inside and outside the country. As a result,
local governments which had very little knowledge and experience on the issue gained awareness
and competence on delivery of community services such that by the end of the project they took
full responsibility of the planning and administration of services which in itself is a good proxy of
improved capacity. However, since the project indicators which tracked achievement of this
objective are all output indicators and the team was not able to identify data that measured
performance of local government capacity before and after, the achievement of this objective is
rated moderately satisfactory.

a. Establishment of Institutions and Committees

110.     A significant achievement of the project was establishing a training unit within the SSS.
This unit is responsible for planning all capacity building needs of central and local staff of
related central and local institutions, staff of the NGOs involved and staff of the local units.

111.     The project also supported the establishment of the Inspectorate of Social Services as an
official body to house inspectors to assess quality standards. The Inspectorate is established in
the SSS and has 12 regional offices. It oversees the quality of service delivery according to the
established standards in both residential care centers and daily services. The methodology of the
inspection is approved by a special decision of the Council of Ministers. The inspectorate is
responsible for inspecting each service center at least twice a year.


                                                 29
112.    The project provided technical assistance to establish regional level planning committees.
These committees are responsible for assessing the social service needs in their own areas and
coordinating all the needed activities for social service delivery. Usually, they have 13 members
from social sectors, police, NGOs, media, etc. Furthermore, specific units were established at
regional level within SSS, responsible solely for social services.

113.    With support from the regional SSS offices, community care plans were also established
in each of the 8 regions.

b. Training and Capacity Building

114.     The project provided substantial support to training/capacity building of central and local
government staff, as well as the relevant NGOs. The trainings were focused on the new mission
of the local governments (based on the new law and strategy); their tasks and responsibilities for
managing the services; participation of the civil society in service delivery; establishing specific
financial mechanisms necessary for the delivery of services; and social service delivery.

Training on the New Social Services Standards

115.     All local and central staff were trained on the new standards and the legislative
framework for daily residential care centers. Almost 900 people from all over the country were
trained. Specifically, the following staff was trained 12:

       •   120 senior staff of the local government units in the region of Tirane, Shkoder, Durres
           and Vlore (during the first stage of project implementation).
       •   160 social workers in the same regions/municipalities.
       •   160 specialists/staff of the regional departments of communes/qarku, in the same areas
       •   200 NGO representatives
       •   240 residential care center staff, on their new role under the process of
           decentralization/deinstitutionalization of daily and residential services.

116.     In order to familiarize stakeholders with the new approach (model) of daily social
services, a number of study visits were organized by the British Council. This approach provided
exposure, in particular, to local government staff and had a positive impact on implementation of
services. The following were trained and/ or participated in different study visits13: (i) eight senior
staff of the qarku of Tirana; (ii) eight other experts from central and local level benefited from
trainings in England, Sweden, Scotland and Italy; and (iii) a number of civil society
representatives.

117.    During the second stage of project implementation, training was extended to four other
regions as well as two separate municipalities. During this stage, senior staff of local
governments as well as the social workers attached to the local offices was included.

Training and Capacity Building in Social Service Delivery

118.    Training needs were assessed and programs prepared for 170 staff of the SSS, both at
central and local offices; 540 professionals involved in service provision in residential care
centers; and 500 staff, mainly from the NGOs, directly involved in service delivery to clients.
Training programs were also prepared and delivered for staff who work with disabled, trafficking
victims and elderly in 2008 and 2009.

119.       In addition, the following manuals were prepared the project provided support for:

       •   An operational manual for social workers
       •   A service delivery manual for social services for children was also prepared.

C. Awareness Raising for Community Based Services.

120.    A public information and awareness raising strategy, including roles and responsibilities,
was developed through DFID technical assistance. It was updated and enhanced following project
closure. In addition, the British Council delivered two-day training to MoLSA, SSS, local
governments, NGOs and local working groups on how to conduct public information campaigns.

121.       A public information unit was also created within the SSS with project support.

Revised objective (iii) improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the pension system in
Albania through: (a) improving pension system administration; (b) institutional
strengthening including improved capacity for pension policy development; and (c)
improving public understanding of the pension system.

Achievement of this objective is Satisfactory.

122.     Nine out of 12 indicators for this objective have been met or exceeded. Three indicators
are only partially met. Two have to do with the digitization of records which will reach 100
percent by November/December 2013 14 and one (which has to do with staffing) was determined
that the target was set too high.

a. Improving pension system administration

123.     This project has contributed significantly to improving the Social Insurance Institute’s
(SII) administration the pensions system. Outputs that contributed to improving pension system
administration include a strategy, a business plan, new business processes, new software with
training, development of a financial management system, management training, new offices, and
the development of an electronic central registry of contributors.

124.    This has allowed SSI to better detect fraud in the system and achieve cost savings.
Because of the political sensitivity of the information on fraudulent claims, SSI was unable to
provide exact numbers. They are, however, able to measure the reduction in fraudulent claims.
For instance, just through the creation of the electronic registry of beneficiaries, SSI found around

     See Government’s input to the ICR.

                                                  31
2000 pensioners with false birth dates and 100 cases were identified where the same person
collected two pensions in different regions since 2012.

125.    Development of the electronic registry of contributors and beneficiaries has also reduced
the number of documents required for claiming benefits from 8 to 5 and reduced the number of
days for providing a formal response to pension applications from 60 to 25 days. Number of
contributors with accessible electronic records is now more that 500,000 (rural and urban). 80
percent of records have been transferred from paper to electronic form whilst all records are
under SII control. Currently, SII also has adequate trained staff (2) who can carry out actuarial
projections.

126.   Finally, according to public opinion surveys carried out in 2012 and 2013, this has
improved client services in pension administration. The baseline survey showed that 49% of those
surveyed had a positive opinion of pension administration, compared to 75% at project closure.

b. Institutional strengthening including improved capacity for pension policy development

127.     SII capacity for pension policy development and capacity in general, was improved
through establishing a Pension Policy Analyses and Identification Unit and training staff within
this unit to carry out actuarial analysis. This led to a request by the GoA to the Bank to update the
2006 Social Insurance Review Study, development of actuarial projections, and discussions on
pension policy reform options. Some technical assistance has also been provided to develop the
legislation approximation with the EU social insurance legislation.

128.     Impact of these capacity improvements; however, have not been fully been reflected in
policy reforms as policy dialogue on pension reform has stalled due to the inability of the main
political parties to agree on the direction of the reform.

c. Improving public understanding of the pension system.

129.    Following the first public opinion survey in 2012, SII organized a workshop with the
main stakeholders to discuss the findings and report recommendations. Following this survey, SII
also commissioned a consultancy to prepare an overall communications strategy. Finally, SII
carried out a public awareness campaign, which was completed in December 2012. A second
public opinion survey was carried out in February/March 2013.

130.    The results indicate that the communications strategy and public awareness campaigns
have been successful. Public understanding of the pension system has greatly improved.
According to the latest public opinion survey 95% of respondents know their pension rights, 75%
indicate they have improved access to information about their benefits and contributions, and
75% feel there is improved transparency and public understanding of the pension system (See
Annex 1-Results Framework for baseline information.).


3.3 Efficiency

131.    Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return and Financial Rate of Return analysis are
not applicable. Cost effectiveness analysis was not carried out. However, there is evidence that
the project made three contributions to improve the efficiency of national social services and
pensions system which have resulted in better allocation and use of financial resources as follows:


                                                 32
     (i)         Reduction of cost of social services;
     (ii)        Improvements in the targeting and management of social assistance; and
     (iii)       Improved administration of pensions

132.         In particular, the project introduced the following improvements:

     •       Better definition of “vulnerability” and “eligibility” for social services, establishment of
             standards and provision of services at the community level has also improved access and
             efficiency of social services, such that unit costs of delivery of services through
             community centers are much less than that of residential care centers. The daily cost for
             clients in community daily care centers as opposed to residential centers is 3 to 4 times
             less 15 . The project also rehabilitated old buildings for the residential care centers as
             opposed to building new ones. The cost of a new building as compared to a rehabilitated
             building is estimated to be at least 2.2 times more.
     •       The government identified the need to improve targeting as well as implementation of the
             the Ndihme Ekonomike (NE) cash transfer program which is run by the municipal
             governments with financing from central government. The project funded studies on NE,
             including developing options for improved targeting. Improvements in targeting were
             implemented as a result of this program, with further improvements are underway under
             separate operation. Overall, the targeting accuracy of NE improved from 2005 to 2008,
             with a higher share of the benefits going to poorer households. A large share of the total
             benefits (82 percent) is received by the poorest 40 percent of the population. As of 2008,
             56 percent of total benefits went to those in the poorest quintile of the population
             (compared to 43.2 percent in 2002), and only six percent to those in the wealthiest
             quintile (compared to 3.4 in 2002). Mainly because of MOLSA’s efforts to tighten the
             process for determining eligibility, coverage and spending has fallen. Spending on NE
             declined from 0.8 percent of GDP in 2000 to 0.35 percent of GDP 2010. Coverage has
             fallen from 15 percent of the total population in 2005 to seven percent by 2008. 16 There
             has been a parallel reduction in the percentage of the poor covered, however, and work is
             ongoing to improve eligibility criteria and errors of exclusion to improve this percentage
             under the current Social Assistance Modernization project.
     •       The support to SII has produced efficiency gains. Because the pensions system and funds
             are better managed, there has been a reduction in fraudulent claims for pensions. Exact
             cost savings cannot be quantified as the SII considers the information on number of
             fraudulent claims confidential. However, just through creating an electronic register of
             beneficiaries, SSI found around 2000 pensioners with false birth dates and 100 cases
             were identified where the same person collected two pensions in different regions. SSI is
             now recovering the funds from these fraudulent pension claims. By developing the online
             payment system, SSI was able to eliminate the continued payment of pensions after death
             or payments above the benefit amount calculated by SII.

Based on the above the efficiency of the project is rated as substantial.

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

133.     Based on substantial relevance of design and project development objectives to
Government’s current vision of social protection and social service delivery, substantial
efficiency gains realized in social service and social assistance delivery and pensions
administration, moderately satisfactory achievement of two out of four project development
objectives, and difficulty in measuring achievement of some of the PDOs, the overall outcome
rating is moderately satisfactory.

134.     The project was successful in increasing access to various types of social services to
vulnerable groups, and increasing the number of direct beneficiaries under daily care services.
Likewise, improvements in 13 residential care centers resulted in better quality services. The
project was also instrumental in the preparation and approval of the Law on Social Services and
Assistance and development of service standards, and improving the capacity for planning,
managing, and delivering social care services with direct involvement of local governments,
communities and civil society. The project also successfully improved the efficiency and
effectiveness of the pension system by strengthening the pension administration systems, pension
policy development capacity and public understanding of the system.

135.     There is not adequate evidence tracked by project indicators or other data to indicate that:
(i) there are now systematic monitoring and evaluation processes in place within the MOLSA; (ii)
institutional capacities at local government and central level for managing and delivering services
are consistently satisfactory; and (iii) the pension administration is fully improved as intended. In
addition it is not possible to measure the impact the project had on standards of living, which was
part of the original DO. For these reasons as well the overall achievement of objectives is rated
moderately satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

136.     Although data to substantiate a direct impact on poverty does not exist, it is reasonable to
note that the project had a positive impact on the lives of many vulnerable people by improving
their access to essential social services and bringing about sustainable quality improvements. The
Project’s focus on children with disabilities, elderly and vulnerable women improved families’
ability to engage in economic activities whilst dependents are provided with care either at home
or community centers.

137.     Specific interventions for vulnerable women included: rehabilitation of women at risk,
financial support for women with several children, psycho-sociological counseling and legal
counseling for battered women and for resolving family disputes, and counseling to parents to
care for children with disabilities.

138.    (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening (One of the project’s main aims was bringing
about institutional change. The project had substantial institutional development impact on the
MOLSA and SII organizational structure and capacity. In addition, local governments and
INSTAT have become more competent institutions in carrying out their core and new mandates
as follows:


                                                 34
139.    The project was instrumental in restructuring of State Social Services (SSS), a semi-
autonomous agency under the auspices of MOLSA. After the restructuring, this institution has
taken over the role of inspecting and monitoring social services, rather than delivering these
services, with the exception of the Ndihme Ekonomike (NE) program. SSS is currently
functioning at the central, regional, and municipal levels. Special bodies have been created at
regional levels for the delivery of social services, while the regional directorates are responsible
for monitoring at regional levels. In several regions, regional directorates have prepared and are
implementing medium-term and long-term regional/community social service plans which define
needs priorities per locality as well as responsibilities of local government’s vis-à-vis non-state
service providers (NGOs and other).

140.    The training provided through the project and the experience gained during
implementation has improved MOLSA capacity to plan and administer services. Local
governments have become better equipped in service delivery, responsible and accountable
because of the achievements of the project. Additional care centers were established outside of
the project and in 2013 there are nearly twice as many centers operating and providing services
compared to 2009. Subsequent to the completion of the activities under the original part of the
project in 2009, other social services were established based on the criteria and licensing
requirements established by the project. Currently, there are 183 public and private entities
licensed by MOLSA to provide social services directly to clients.

141.     Further, the project contributed significantly in defining the roles and responsibilities of:
MOLSA, SSS and local governments. Officials became more sensitive to the needs of the
population and the necessity to interact and engage with beneficiaries. It also inspired further
improvements to the National Law on Social Services and Assistance in March 2011 which
refined roles and responsibilities for social service delivery.

142.     The project institutionalized community social services as opposed to residential services.
It shifted the national standard for elderly care from residential to daily care centers, in line with
the UN directives on aging. This model is now being implemented more widely in the provision
of services to the elderly.

143.   INSTAT has also benefited from substantial technical and financial assistance to field
and complete four household level Living Standards Monitoring Surveys and annual surveys.
INSTAT is now an institution fully capacitated to carry out these surveys independently

144.   Project support has also helped SII to become a world class technical agency with ability
to administer the Albanian pension system and advise policy makers on policy reform options.


(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

145.    The project did not have unintended outcomes and impacts.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome


Ratings: Moderate

146.    Overall sustainability of the project is highly likely, as a number of local governments
(such as Tirana, Durres, etc.) have already taken over the financing of social services and
expanded them based on the new model of community based services introduced by the project.
Since 2009, there are twice as many centers which operate and provide social services throughout
the country of which over 80 percent are financed by local and central government funding.
However, some local governments are still financially weak and in some cases would not be able
to maintain services. For such cases, the MOLSA has been mandated by the Ministry of Finance
to have a dedicated budget line to be used for cases of proven need to support social protection
programs. This budget line is planned to be partly used also for maintaining the social care
services in those regions/communes where the local government is still financially weak. This
will ensure sustainability of service delivery to vulnerable groups, while strengthening local
government capacities. Further, irrespective of the change of administrations, political
commitment is highly likely at the central level confirmed by the recent improvements to the
2005 Social Services and Social Inclusion Law enacted in 2011 which give more autonomy to
local governments for social service delivery and better define access criteria to social assistance
and social care programs.       There are also well established financing, accountability, and
reporting mechanisms between local governments and MOLSA that are in place and functional.

147.    On the other hand, continuity of staff at local governments is very crucial to ensure the
sustainability of quality services, and this will need to be monitored by the national government.

148.    With respect to poverty monitoring and evaluation, with project support, a reliable and
continuous system of poverty monitoring based on Living Standards Monitoring Surveys is in
place and will continue to be supported with Government funding. The most recent survey has
been completed in 2012; results have not yet been published

149.    The SII will continue to be a high profile technical agency which will continue to be
responsible for pension system administration given the political and economic importance
attached to the issue.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

150.     The Bank's performance in the identification, preparation, and appraisal of the project
was moderately satisfactory. The project’s consistency with the government’s development
priorities and the Bank’s CAS was assured. During preparation and appraisal, the Bank took into
account the adequacy of project design and all major relevant aspects, such as technical, financial,
economic, and institutional, including procurement and financial management. In addition, major
risk factors and lessons learned from other earlier projects in the social sectors were considered


                                                36
and incorporated into the project design. The project also provided a participatory framework by
involving stakeholders and direct beneficiaries in the decision-making processes.

151.    Project preparation was carried out with an adequate number of specialists who provided
the technical skill mix necessary to address concerns. Further, the TTL during preparation was
very experienced in similar projects on social services. The Bank provided adequate resources in
terms of staff weeks and dollar amount to ensure quality preparation and appraisal work. The
Bank had a consistently good working relationship with the Borrower during preparation and
appraisal.

152.    On the other hand, the project development objective was set a very high level; i.e. “to
improve the standards of living of the poor and vulnerable populations in Albania through….”
making it difficult to measure and to attribute any changes in welfare improvements over the
period to improvements in social services or social assistance. Furthermore, compared to current
standards, the project M&E framework was not well defined with clear indicators and targets
hence it was not utilized but had to be revised throughout the implementation period.

153.     In addition, considering the Bank had recently entered into the social protection field in
Albania, the project design was very ambitious with too many activities. A phased in program
whereby technical assistance and capacity development activities preceded the investments in
infrastructure may have worked better. It would have allowed both the Bank and the borrower to
design new project activities and objectives based on the latest thinking and good practice.

(b) Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

154.     Bank's performance during implementation was satisfactory. The continuity of task
management and the presence of the TTL who was based in the country ensured continuous and
close supervision of the project. The task team focused on the project’s development impact.
The Bank allocated sufficient budget and staff resources, and the project was adequately
supervised and closely monitored. The Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) realistically rated
the performance of the project both in terms of achievement of development objectives and
project implementation. However, the project Results Framework was not fully adjusted and
arrived at a definitive set of monitoring indicators. There was an attempt during the MTR to
establish a set of indicators; however, the subsequent restructuring and additional financing also
necessitated a complete review and amendment of the results framework. . The task team
regularly prepared Aide-Memoires, alerted the GOA and PCU about issues found during project
execution and facilitated prompt corrective action, particularly in relation to financial
management and procurement. Bank’s procurement and financial management staff worked with
MOLSA staff to explain the rules and procedures to be applied during project implementation,
with regard to procurement of goods and works, and selection of consultants, accounts and audits,
based on the Credit Agreement.

155.      The task team received good support from the Bank’s senior management and within the
unit, especially during difficult periods of implementation. The implementation period and the
life of the project was lengthened purposefully as management wanted to make use of an existing
instrument respond to Government’s changing needs in particular on pension administration. The
task team carried out an MTR in May 2005, and reviewed the project’s progress towards its
development objectives, the status of MTR targets, and main issues of project implementation
and sought agreement with government on the project’s future direction. The Bank was able to

                                                37
adjust the project design based on the implementation experience and respond to the changing
needs and demands from the client and reallocate project funds accordingly in 2005 and 2008.
Also, an additional financing was processed in 2009 to support the Government of Albania’s
request for further support for pension systems reform. On the other hand, the Bank missed the
opportunity to use the MTR, restructuring and/or additional financing to redefine indicators and
develop a well-designed and monitorable M&E framework.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

156.    Based on the Bank performance during lending phase and supervision as discussed above,
overall Bank Performance is rated as Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

157.     The Borrower, represented by MOLSA as well as Ministry of Finance, were very
committed during the project preparation period (for both original and additional financing). They
worked with the Bank team on the project objectives and engaged NGOs, civil society and local
government in the preparation process. One strong indication of the commitment was the
establishment of the project Steering Committee, Project Coordination Unit and assignment of the
core technical team to work on the project preparation. The working groups established by the
MOLSA/GASS for preparation of individual project components carried out participatory
regional stakeholder workshops in four pilot districts. A participatory Log Frame development
exercise was carried out in January 2001. The project objectives and activities were reconfirmed
during a national stakeholder workshop conducted by the Government during the project
appraisal in February 2001. However, the turn-over in Directors of the PCU delayed
implementation progress.

158.     The government consistently maintained its commitment throughout implementation.
Despite strong commitment and strategic vision on social protection, it took a longer than
expected to translate the vision into a legal framework and policies to operationalize improved
service delivery and social assistance. The government (MOLSA and Ministry of Finance)
officials worked closely with the Bank's project team on a continuous basis, played an active role
in implementation and cooperated fully with the task team. Appropriate levels of review and
approval were usually in place; financial accountability and follow-up was observed, and
expenditures were duly authorized before they were incurred; and documentation was maintained
properly for periodic review. The project did not suffer from any counterpart funding problems,
as the GOA took timely corrective measures and made appropriate budget provisions.

159.    During the project period, the government changed three times, and the Minister of Labor
changed five times. As a result of the frequent change of Minister, the task team was constrained
to explain the project to each one of them and make them committed to the project. The arrival of
each Minister created a period of uncertainty, and this, in turn, affected implementation to some
extent. However, the core staff in the Ministry remained the same, which ensured continuity in
implementation.

                                               38
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

160.     A project coordination unit (PCU) established within the State Social Services Unit
(formerly General Administration of Social Services) of MOLSA was responsible for
procurement, disbursement, logistics, and all other aspects of project implementation for all
components other than the pension systems administration. The PCU was staffed with six full-
time local employees who had been competitively recruited by a recruitment commission,
established by a ministerial decree and comprising a MOLSA representative, an NGO
representative, and an expert in the social field. The primary implementing agency for the
additional financing, supporting pension systems administration, was the Social Security Institute
(SII). The SII implemented the project under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance.

161.    Project Management: There was significant staff and project manager turnover in the
SSS PCU. This impacted project implementation negatively and caused significant delays.
Similarly, the SII was not familiar with Bank procedures and did not have adequate capacity to
tackle procurement and financial management bottleneck swiftly.

162.    Financial Management: The financial management system including accounting,
controls, auditing and reporting was adequate and satisfied the Bank’s financial management
requirements. All FMRs reviewed were submitted on a timely basis and found to be satisfactory.
The financial audit reports were all received on time and the opinions in the Management Letters
were “unqualified” in regard to the project’s financial statements. However, during certain
periods of time, such as at the end of 2007, there were delays from the financial management side
of the project and lack of follow-up on financial management supervision, overall FM
performance was moderately satisfactory.

163.    Procurement Arrangements: Procurement of all works, goods and technical services
under the project followed the Procurement Guidelines “Procurement under IBRD Loans and
IDA Credits”. In terms of capacity, in 2006, the person in charge of procurement left PCU, and
procurement activities suffered due to lack of experience of the person who succeeded her. This,
in return, caused delays in project implementation. To compensate this, a part-time employee
was appointed to work on procurement packages and project procurement staff was trained by the
World Bank.

164.     Reporting Arrangements: The PCU submitted all required quarterly and annual reports
with minor delays. These reports were informative, and provided valuable feedback on how the
PCU was progressing covering all project activities. The status of performance indicators were
incorporated in all progress reports and served as valuable input to Bank supervision mission
reports.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

165.   In light of the Government and PCU performance as discussed above, the overall
performance of the Borrower was moderately satisfactory.



                                               39
6. Lessons Learned

     •   Political economy may dictate that project design has multiple layers and complexities
         even when institutional capacities are not at par. In that case, the Bank teams need to
         ensure that an appropriate lending or other instrument is used to accommodate the
         financial resource requirements and capacity constraints and that the project design and
         instrument is able to evolve and respond to changing circumstances.

     •   When entering a sector where the Borrower has little experience and knowledge, it is
         helpful to provide support for policy development and use it as a platform to jumpstart an
         in-country policy dialogue and build consensus around a legal framework. This has long-
         lasting institutional impacts as evidenced by the SSDP experience.

     •   Institutional change takes a long time yet with ample implementation support and time, it
         yields long-lasting results. It has taken over three years to develop a national strategy and
         law on social assistance and social services in Albania however the project was
         instrumental in bringing together the different stakeholders, allowing learning by doing
         and further evolution of the legal framework.

     •   Monitoring indicators and a system for data collection and evaluation need to be clearly
         established at the beginning of the project to evaluate project implementation and the
         achievement of project objectives. It is also essential to develop adequate skills for the
         staff working on monitoring and evaluation at all levels.

     •   Building local procurement and financial management capacity right at the beginning of
         the project is crucial for smooth implementation. In addition, it is important to have a
         designated, well-trained procurement professional within the borrower’s project
         implementing team.

Project Component 1: Policy Development (Disbursement: US$ 1,050,230 NEED TO VERIFY)
Sub-Component                   Outputs
Sub-Component 1.1: Poverty      • Establishment of a Poverty Monitoring Unit in MOLSA, including logistical support with three fully trained experts
Monitoring and Evaluation          and an established system of yearly surveys.
                                • Updated poverty maps in 2005 and 2007
                                • Studies related to the government strategy on social assistance programs, including a specific studies on ndihme
                                   ekonomike (including on targeting options)
                                • The MOLSA section of the national Strategy for Socio-Economic development (on a yearly basis).
                                • The project supported INSTAT to carry out the: (i) LSMS 2002, (ii) LSMS 2005, (iii) LSMS 2008, and (iv) the HBS
                                   in 2007. The LSMS 2012 was also recently completed. Also delivered was the development and implementation of
                                   training for the surveyors conducting the LSMS.
Sub-component 1.2:              • MOLSA, with support from the DFID financed part of the project drafted and successfully completed the Law on
Development of social services     Social Assistance and Services and all 38 secondary laws. The law was widely discussed and went through a long
policies                           process of consultations, before Parliament approval.

establishing Poverty Monitoring Unit at the MoLSAEO, defining new roles and responsibilities
of the responsible structures for social assistance and services at different levels of central and
local governance and capacity building supporting these structures, in order to fulfill the new
responsibilities within the new legal, structural and administrative framework.

Component 2 – Strengthen capacities for social services structures

This component focused on capacity building for the structures responsible for social assistance
and services at central, regional and local level, for public and private service providers, NOGs
working at the social area, training and preparation of professionals etc. New structures
responsible for the funding, administration, monitoring and inspection of social services at the
central and local levels were established.

Component 3 – Community based social services

This component helped in the establishment, in cooperation with local units, of 43 new
community services for children, youth, disabled people, elderly, women in need etc. These
services were covered by project funds and based on the agreement signed by local power too,
will continue to be funded by the local government funds. The service standards were developed,
the licensing procedure was established and the structures of inspections for NGO service
providers were established.

Component 4 – Project management, information and monitoring system

In order to coordinate the logistical, technical and financial activities of the project the respective
unit was established at the State Social Services Unit. This unit has maintained the
correspondence and documentation for all project related activities.

4. Main activities of the Project and achieved results

4.1 Component 1 - Policy development and capacity building

For this component, 1,050,232 USD have been disbursed, supporting three sub-components. The
project provided significant assistance to draft the legislation on the reform of the social
assistance and services system, the poverty evaluation and monitoring 2002/2005 supporting
INSTAT in carrying out the LSMS, the establishment of the Poverty Monitoring Unit at the
MoLSAEO, as well as develop pension policies.




                                                  51
4.1.1. First sub-component: Poverty evaluation and monitoring.

The Project “Social Service Distribution”, supported INSTAT with funds and expertise on the
accomplishment of LSMS 2002 and 2005 and at present, in cooperation with other donors like
UNDP, is carrying out the 2008 LSMS.

The Poverty Unit was established at the Ministry of Labor, with three experts who were properly
trained and supplied with necessary logistics. The poverty unit together with the directorates of
policies at the Ministry, evaluated the LSMS data as well as the administrative data of the
Ministry of Labor, drafted reports and provided recommendations for the complete and improved
poverty map and distribution methodology of social assistance for each municipality/commune.

The findings of 2002 and 2005 LSMS and the results of General Population Registration (2001)
have helped the Ministry of Labor in drafting new policies to improve the poverty mapping. For
the first time, a poverty map was defined which was updated later with the 2005 LSMS data. The
new poverty map serves as basic instrument for the identification of families in need and for
better targeting the social assistance to poor areas and families.

Based on the LSMS findings, about 18.5% of the population in Albania in 2005 lived under the
poverty line of 2 USD per day per person, compared to 25% evaluated in 2002. Based on the
evaluations of the data from the poverty mapping and administrative data of MoLSAEO, in 2007
the level of population living under 2 USD/day/person reached the level of 6%. The 2008 LSMS
supported by the project and other donors, will serve to improve further the poverty map, which
on its end will contribute in poverty reduction and distribution of designated state budget funds
for social assistance and services for groups in need at municipalities and communes.

The impact of this sub-component consists in: i) a new poverty map of 2005; ii) establishment of
the Poverty Unit at MoLSAEO; iii) updated poverty map of 2007; iv) social assistance program
based on poverty map data; v) more accurate identification of poor population and families, living
with 2 USD per day per person; vi) exclusion from the NE scheme of abusive cases (number of
families profiting from NE reached the number of 90 thousand in 2008 compared to 150 thousand
in 2002); vii) guarantee of social inclusion in NE schema.

4.1.2. Development of social services policies.

Law no. 9355, dated 10.03.2005 was the first product carried out with the support of the project.
The draft-law went through a long consultative process with all actors involved in the
decentralization process and establishment of community services such as the central institutions
which are in direct interaction with the social services; local power structures which had an
important role in implementing social programs for poverty reduction; civil society as a provider
of services as well as different donors operating in Albania.

The Law no. 9355 was completed within 2006 with 38 other acts and sub-acts and was published
by the Project Unit as a separate package distributed then to all municipalities, communes and
regions in the country as well as to the Ministry and central institutions, donors, NGOs etc. A CD
with the legislation in English has been distributed to the donors, experts and is published at the
webpage of the Ministry of Labor.

In 2006 the process of implementation of the legislation started by the responsible structures at
central, local level and by other responsible actors.


                                                  52
The impact of this sub-component i) preparation and publication of the legal and sub-legal
package in 1200 copies; ii) provision of 2-3 copies of this legal package to 384 local power units;
iii) provision of 3-5 copies of this package to the ministries and subordinate institutions; iv) one
copy was provided to 300 NGOs operating in the social areas; v) a CD of legislation package in
English as well as the strategy was provided to all donors and other international organizations
operating in Albania; vi) the strategy of social services drafted with the support of the project was
distributed to 384 local power units, 300 NGOs, to the ministry and other institutions.

With the support of the project (British Council) the Social Services Strategy for 2005-2010 was
drafted which defines the following specific objectives: i) decentralization of services and
increase of competencies for their administration by the local government, ii) establishment and
distribution of community based services; iii) gradual transition from residential services to
community based services; iv) expanding types of social services; v) increase of cooperation and
inclusion of social society organizations in community based services provision; vi) incitement of
participation of private business in funding and offering social services as well as consolidation of
social business models; vii) participation of local power in funding social services supported by
local power income etc.

The Social Services Strategy and Law no. 9355 served as two basic documents for the
materialization of the reform’s objectives in the social area and in defining the new
responsibilities of the actors at the conditions of decentralization of responsibilities and
competencies of the service administration and provision by the local government.

This strategy was re-evaluated once again and presented in a new document – Sectorial Strategy
of Social Protection 2008-2013, where the objectives were further specified and detailed since
concrete actions were taken in decentralization and empowerment of local power units to
implement the new responsibilities. The objective on social services is to expand the community
services all over the country, secure continuance and consistency of the established services,
guarantee quality, establish staff capacities, ensure financial accountability etc.

Decentralization – Upon the approval of the Law in March 2005, the process of decentralization
and transfer of competencies towards local government started. Based on continuous
Government decisions 19 residential and daily institutions were transferred to the ownership and
administration of local power units. This process was accompanied by: i) transfer of building’s
ownership from State Social Services to public government ownership and administration; ii)
transfer of inventory and equipment of the buildings to the ownership and administration of local
government; iii) delegation of funds from MoLSAEO at the beginning of the year to each local
government unit as a conditional grant with the aim of supporting these centers; iv) transfer of
personnel under the supervision of municipalities in compliance with the approved structure by
the order of the Prime Minister, in line with the organic budget law. These services continue to
function regularly and are supported through consultancy and expertise by the Ministry of Labor.

4.1.3   Development and implementation of pension policies.

Based on the amendment made to the Agreement of World Bank Credit signed on 26 March 2008,
it has been decided that this sub-component be further supported during the period April 2008-
September 2009, by a fund of US$ 2.7 million, aiming at reforming the administration of the
social insurance in the country.




                                                 53
4.2 Capacity building in social services structures

The amount of US$ 387,300 has been disbursed for this component, for the physical
rehabilitation and provision of equipment to the offices of the social assistance and services
structures.

The results of this component are evaluated as decisive for the success of the reform to be carried
out and for the implementation of the legislation on social assistance and services in all
governance levels. The component has supported public campaigns, general and specific
trainings to the staff of directorates of MoLSAEO, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Finance,
members of Parliament, responsible for the social policies, employees of State Social Services,
local power units, regional units, municipalities, communes, community planning committees,
residential and daily public centers, NGOs offering services, family and beneficiaries’
associations, etc.

4.2.1 Administration and monitoring of social services

Establishment of new community services and decentralization was based on Law no. 8652 dated
31.07.2000 “On organization and functioning of local power”; law no. 9355, dt 10.03.2005 “On
Social Assistance and services”; objectives of the Social Services Strategy implemented in 2005-
2007 and at present based also on objectives of Sectoral Strategy of Social Protection, Inter-
sectoral Strategy of Social Inclusion 2007-2013 and National Strategy of Development and
Integration.

New responsibilities on social services resulting from law no. 9355 produced a new approach on
responsibilities by the central and local institutions. Ministry of Labor has taken over the
responsibility to: i) develop policies and draft national legislation; ii) monitor the implementation
of legislation; iii) draft national budget for social services, NE and PAK and delegation of funds
to local power units; iv) license the social services providers; v) draft standards of social services
etc.

State Social Services, local or central, as an intermediary institution between policy maker level
(MoLSAEO) and implementing level (Local Power); i) evaluates poverty and programs funds for
NE, PAK and social services; ii) monitors and inspects use of funds and implementation of
quality standards of social services; iii) is responsible for implementation of legislation; iv)
programs the needs for capacity increase of staff at central and local levels.

Local Government Units, have other duties to: i) identify families and individuals in need of NE,
PAK, social services and draft requests for funds; ii) establish new types of social services in
compliance with community needs; iii) administer residential institutions of services and monitor
services at daily centers and community; iv) pre-select as per public procurement the private
offering NGOs licensed for offering social services; v) carry out the distribution of payments of
NE and PAK; vi) gather, process and distribute statistics to central structures etc.

The directorates/sectors of social services at local government were established and empowered
by implementing the responsibilities for the establishment and administration of new services in
cooperation with non-profitable organizations that have established different services models.

In order to evaluate the needs of individuals, groups and different social categories as well as
their coverage by social services, with the support of the project at region level the Community
Planning Committees were established, consisting of 13 members from social, education, health,

                                                 54
police, local government, NGOs, media and other areas. The Planning Committees except for the
evaluation of needs coordinate also the different activities among local units in the region. At
region level the social sectors of Tirana, Shkodra, Durres and Vlora were established.

The impact of this component consists in: i) drafting, approval and implementation of Decision of
Council of Ministers on establishment of social structures at county(qarku) level; ii) drafting,
approval and implementation of Instruction on functioning and roles of social services sector at
county level; iii) establishment of four planning committees at commune level; iv) training for
160 social workers at six workshops, where experts of county, municipalities/communes,
participated on the role, duties, mission of these offices for the identification of social problems
and cooperation among them.

The State Social Service (SSS) was restructured, being transferred as an Inspectorate which
evaluates the social needs as per the poverty map, monitors and supports the local government
unit on legislation enforcement, submits to the respective ministry, MOLSA the local needs,
statistics and information, etc.

The project supports the legislative, structural and administrative measures for three important
elements which guarantee the service quality : i) licensing of the social services providers; ii)
inspection on standards implementation with relevant central and local structures; iii)
development of services standards, instructions and auxiliary materials for their implementation
by public and private providers.

It’s established, within the SSS, the Department of Social Services Inspectorate having 12
regional offices (apart from its headquarter). The Methodology of Social Services Inspection has
been prepared for supporting the inspectors work and aiming at making inspection a supporting,
informing and monitoring instrument for the providers of public and private services.

The impact of this objective is reflected in : i) setting up of a special structure in central and local
level for inspecting standards of social community-based and residential services; ii) development,
approval and implementation of the DCM no. 512, date. 31.05.2006, “Standards inspection
Methodology”, which unifies the standards implementation process; iii) approval and
implementation of the MOLSA order on “Carrying out the services’ inspection; iv) training of the
central and regional office inspectors; v) programming and carrying out inspections twice a year
on the private and public services providers; vi) services higher quality for the beneficiaries,
based also on the requirements for new standards implementation.

The License Commission for Social Services providers is set up within the Ministry of Labor,
Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities. It is headed by the Deputy Minister and includes
representatives of Department of Social Services Policies, Social Services, Legal Department,
State Social Service, department of Social Labor in the Department of Social Labor, at Faculty of
Social Sciences, as well as by representatives of services providers.

Licensing of social services better guarantees clients protection from poor quality services;
application of social services standards and quality improvement; evidencing of all service
providers and establishment of cooperation links in central and local level; better knowledge of
target groups, their needs and avoidance of services overlapping; enabling local government
relevant bodies to better recognize the services’ providers and supporting them in the process of
new service offering to the community.



                                                  55
The standards clearly and measurably define the criteria to be met by a service or service provider.
They constitute a public document which helps the service’ users in completing the obligations
they are committed.

Standards development has been characterized by: i) participation of professionals of services and
social services providers, central and local level specialists, beneficiaries and related field experts;
ii) building of capacities, parallel with the development of standards; iii) social inclusion and
reflection of all participants opinion, from all levels and wide geographical representation; iv)
experience use from the basic level of services, beneficiaries and community and its transferring
to decision making levels.

The standards were published together with the legal package supported by the project; these
were also distributed as special documents to all municipalities/communes and public and private
operators providing services for different categories of beneficiaries in the community based and
residential centers. The application of such standards has started since 2007.

Impact (i) Five standards of social services were developed, approved and are in the
implementation stage, after their joint distribution with the legal package to all institutions,
central and local, to municipalities /communes as well as to associations and institutions offering
social services for groups in need; ii) standards in 2007 began to be applied in all centers offering
relevant services : for children, persons with limited abilities, old age people and trafficked
people and in risk of trafficking; the service providers, beneficiaries and clients relative are
familiar with these standards.

4.2.2   Strengthening of capacities and qualification in social work

Aiming at a favorable climate for the achievement of this project objectives and purposes, the
Project Unit and “British Council” company engaged in this project had organized a wide
awareness and training campaign through workshops, with the institutions of 4 pilot regions of
local government, and afterwards in the eight counties (qarqet) where community services are set
up, with regional departments of central institutions which operates in site and NGOs offering
services in the region.

There were provided further details in these meetings on: the roles of responsible actors; new
mission of local government in the needs assessment of social categories which require support
for their integration; rights for setting up the community based social services; participation of
civil society in such services provision as well as financial mechanism for adjustment of the
participating actors relations.

Impact: i) there were trained 120 decision making leaders in municipalities/communes in Tirana,
Shkoder, Durres and Vlore; 160 social workers were trained in the four regions of the
municipalities/communes of Tirana, Shkodra, Durrësi and Vlora; 160 specialists of the regional
directorates in municipalities/communes in Tirana, Shkodër, Durrës and Vlorë were trained; 200
NGO staff working in municipalities/communes in Tirane, Shkodër, Durrës and Vlorë were
trained; 240 employees of residential institutions were trained and they were charged with a new
role in the process of decentralization, deinstitutionalization and creation of some daily services
within residential institutions.

The project have organized study tours abroad for getting a better knowledge on the new
mechanism of social services setting up, the actors responsibilities for financing and
administration of community units. The decision making authority representatives got to know in

                                                  56
site the experiences and functioning of such social services. This had a positive influence on the
local government which took the responsibility of setting up community based services.

Impact: i) four chiefs of decision making senior level in cities of Tirana, Durresi, Shkodra, Vlora
were trained and introduced with such services mechanism in England; ii) four senior staff of the
municipalities of Tirana, Durresi, Shkodra, Vlora were trained and introduced with the
mechanism of such services, financing manner, documentation, bidding process and NGOs role
in the community services in England; iii) State Social Service experts of local and central level,
as well as experts of the Ministry and local units were trained and introduced with the mechanism
of such services, financing methods, documentation, bidding process and NGOs role in the
community services in England, Italy, Sweden, Scotland; iv) representatives of NGO-s and social
services institutions were trained and introduced with the mechanism of operation and
documentation of these services in England, Sweden; v) decision makers understood such
services operating mechanism and were part of the finalization process of agreement signed for
such services establishment in 8 counties and 3 municipalities; vi) the result of this experience
was finalized with signing 43 contracts with the municipality and NGOs offering relevant
services.

4.3   Community based social services

An amount of 6,380,000 USD has been disbursed for financing the community based social
services, the civil works for rehabilitation of residential and community centers in both stages of
the project, as well as the supply with goods and equipments for services completion in the
residential/community centers.

There were established in the first stage of the Project the community based daily services for
children, young people, persons with limited ability, girls and women in need and old people.
These were set up in four pilot counties (Tirana, Durresi, Shkodra, and Vlora).

Based on the Operational Manual, the municipalities/communes and NGO-s were invited to bid.
The Board selected the best projects for each city and agreements were signed between the
Ministry of Labor/Project Implementation Unit, municipality/commune and NGOs offering the
services.

In the first stage, there were set up 16 daily centers, offering services to children, young people,
persons with limited abilities, girls and women in need, old people in Tirana, Durrësi, Shkodra

US$ 0.9 million has been spent for the restructuring of 43 premises.

Besides infrastructure improvement of the community based social services established by project
support, a special attention has been given to the residential centers of social care, already
transferred under local government administration. The contracted specialists made an assessment
of the 14 decentralized institutions and prepared cost estimates for premises and infrastructure
improvements aiming at standards implementation and higher quality of services offered.

The impact on the community based and residential centers consist in: better meeting of standards
requirements which are being implemented through installation of heating system; extension of
sanitary joint place; larger doors for easier access of the persons with limited abilities; installation

4.3.1 Financial support for community based services

A special mechanism was set up for financing and monitoring the subprojects providing
community services. Financing of community based social services has been realized in two
phases and the Project implementation unit has spent around US$ 1.7 million for implementation
of 16 projects of the first phase and 27 project of the second phase.

The project supports the professionals committed in offering consultancy with clients, while local
units took the responsibility for covering the cost of the project senior & support staff payment as
well as utilities expenditures, etc.



                                                  58
The Ministry has formulated in 2008 a special Instruction on the use of social protection program
funds for financing the community based services set up in the local units in cooperation with
NGOs as well as for piloting new social policies. This Instruction aimed at services sustainability.
The local government units based on a certain format submit proposals for new or existing
services financing, which are dwelt on by the Commission of Requests Evaluation on Funds
Allocation. These funds give priority to funding of community based services set up in local units
with limited revenue generation from taxes and other local sources and to testing of new social
policies in remote areas with unfavorable infrastructure.

Impact: i) 43 services financed till March 31, 2008; ii) professionals were trained for commitment
in services offering; iii) higher qualification level of professionals in offering qualitative services;
iv) 1/3 of engaged professionals in the community centers of children and multidisciplinary ones
were trained for standards application; v) 2/3 of other professionals offering services for persons
of limited abilities and old people in the community based centers will be trained in October-
December 2008 and during 2009.

4.3.2    capacity building for local government and social services providers

Another objective of the Project has been capacity building for staff of the social assistance and
social services programs, at central and local level. A Training Unit is set up within SSS aiming
at capacity building of central and local institutions staff, and operators offering services in
community centers and NGOs. About 2000 local employees in municipalities, communes,
counties and central structures of the ministries need specific trainings in accordance to
requirements arising from services approved standards.

Impact: i) special structure within SSS (2007) for training needs of staff ii) trainings were carried
(2007) for the providers of children residential and community based services (NGOs and
professionals of children residential centers); iii) the labor manual was prepared and is being
implemented for professionals offering clients services (children); iv) training programs were
prepared to offer services for persons with limited abilities (2008), for traffic victims (2008) and
old people (2009); v) Training needs have been calculated for: 170 employees in SSS structure at
central and local level; 540 professionals and support staff engaged in offering services in
residential institutions; 500 social workers and other professionals, NGO staff which offer public
and private community based services.

4.4     Project management, information and monitoring system

Under this component, around US$ 1,6 million has been disbursed for completion of activities. A
special Unit has been set within State Social Service for project management. This Unit pursuant
to Credit Agreement and Operational Manual has managed all the work for implementation of
components and sub components and has coordinated the work between central and local bodies
as well as with other actors active in the project implementation.

The Unit staff has continuously been trained on implementation of World Bank and Albanian
Government procedures for completing the activities planned under the project:
   - Unit staff has participated in the study tours organized in England, Italy, Netherlands and
      Sweden.
   - The procurement specialist has been trained by ILO in USA.
   - The procurement and finance specialist have been trained in Macedonia by World Bank
      and by ILO in Italy.
   - The finance specialist has been trained in Turkey by the World Bank.

                                                  59
    -   The finance and procurement specialist has been trained in Crown Agents in England, etc.

Project assessment by the Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities

The Ministry considers the project as a very efficient and useful experience for structures in all
governance levels responsible for development, implementation and monitoring of social policies
related to assistance and services provided to people in need.

The project has given a very important contribution since its initial stages on the completion of
the study “Needs and Institutional Capacities Assessment”, whose findings and conclusions
served for working out the project components and objectives. The implementation stage of the
project corresponds with the administrative decentralization process in Albania and the need for
social protection system reformation.

In this framework, the project provides an indisputable contribution to: i) the preparation of legal
base and strategies supporting decentralization of competences and responsibilities of social
services, ii) re-dimensioning of roles and responsibilities in the MOLSA, State Social Service,
local government units and civil society actors, iii) capacity raising and sharing of experiences
with developed countries, iv) setting up of a community network of services, having as first
models the community social services financed by the project, etc.

The project supported the poverty assessment and establishing poverty maps for each local unit,
which did influence positively in a better allocation of funds for poverty reduction oriented
programs (such as Ndihma Ekonomike).

The Ministry considers the project as an important support for the social services policies system
and for the success of the overall reform and considers it a successful experience.

Experience gained by the Project

The MOLSA and institutions under its supervision benefited considerably from the project, in
terms of capacity building. The project implementation provided the possibility to gain
experience in multi directions project’s management process. Structures of all levels, responsible
for social policies were trained by the project in an important moment of the decentralization
process. The experience gained by the project had a special merit in the success of the assistance
and social services system decentralization.

The MOLSA and institutions under its supervision, local government units, service providers,
beneficiaries’ organizations and other local actors, will keep on working for the sustainability of
the project results and for further enriching the community based services network for the
vulnerable people in need.

Assessment of the implementation of the Additional Financing: Supporting Pension
Administration (provided by the Social Insurance Institute)

Number of days for providing formal response to pension applications (positive or negative) less
than 30 days.

This target is met. The average no of days is 25 days but in some regional directories this average
is less than 20 days.


                                                60
Increased no of contributors with accessible electronic individual records

No of contributors with accessible electronic records now is more than 500 000 (rural and urban)

Increased no of beneficiaries with eligibility and benefit level checked

This target is met. The no of beneficiaries checked is 450.000. To date, we are paying through the
system 200.000 pensioners and we have removed the hard copy payment orders. We have ready
for paying online 120 000 other pensioners and we are waiting to prepare the infrastructure for
the payment agent which is the Post Office. These pensioners are in system and we are doing the
verification for them since the post office is not ready.

Increase number of SII staff trained in undertaking actuarial projections

This target is not met but we have trained 2 persons, which are able and have made some
actuarial projections about system

Reduced no of documents required for applying for the pension benefit

We have reduced in total 3 documents but for the rural pension applicants we have reduced 4 of
them. After finishing the process of digitalization of old work history documents we will reduce
in 1 or 2 documents.

Central registry of contributors and beneficiaries introduced and operating

All the equipment is in place (table, chairs, computers, scanners, storage, servers). The employees
of archive work now in the new building.

Improved capacity of SII for pension policy development with actuarial projections and impact of
reform options undertaken by SII

This capacity is improved and our unit has drafted a number of projections which are being used
for the discussions on pension policy.

This project was very successful and we are very satisfied. We reconstructed the existing
buildings and created one of the best archives in the region. This archive is equipped with modern
and useful shelves, scanners, servers, computers, and other facilities. In the same time, we have
developed the software of calculation of benefits, software for the financial system, software for
contribution management, and rehabilitation of 6 regional directories. Through these things done
we can manage better the system, our financial funds, and we have improved the performance
and client service. The culture of our organization is changed and the trust of citizens for the
scheme is increased. We have avoided ghost pensioners, fraud in pensions related to the
eligibility criteria especially in the date of the pension rights. Finishing the digitalization of the
old records will avoid any fraud possibility. Only from the creation of the electronic register of
beneficiaries we have found around 2000 pension with false data of birth and we are collecting
back the debt. Also, we have found 100 cases where the same person collected two pensions in
different regional directories. Doing the payment on line is eliminated the payment of pension
after death or payments above the sum calculated by SII.
