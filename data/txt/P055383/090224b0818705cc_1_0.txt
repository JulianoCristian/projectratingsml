                         The Social Insurance Institute (SII) has procured its furniture, including for the Archive (specific shelves for storing all insurance system's paper evidence) as well as the remaining
                         shopping packages (including the IT licensing). Meanwhile, though there have been considerable delays in the procurement of equipment for the SII Archive, this process is now
                         completed. With SII’s strong commitment in implementing the remaining activities, it is expected that SII Archive will be fully functional by Project’s closing.
