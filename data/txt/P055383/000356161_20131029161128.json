outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            moderate; Bank performance was moderately satisfactory and\n            borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned includes: Political economy may dictate that\n            project design has multiple layers and complexities even\n            when institutional capacities are not at par. When entering\n            a sector where the Borrower has little experience and\n            knowledge, it is helpful to provide support for policy\n            development and use it as a platform to jumpstart an\n            in-country policy dialogue and build consensus around a\n            legal framework. Institutional change takes a long time yet\n            with ample implementation support and time, it yields\n            long-lasting results. Monitoring indicators and a system for\n            data collection and evaluation need to be clearly\n            established at the beginning of the project to evaluate\n            project implementation and the achievement of project\n            objectives. Building local procurement and financial\n            management capacity right at the beginning of the project is\n            crucial for smooth implementation."}, "docdt": "2013-09-27T00:00:00Z"}
