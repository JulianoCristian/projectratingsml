This\n            report provides the findings of an administrative inquiry by\n            the World Bank Group (WBG) Integrity Vice Presidency (INT)\n            into allegations that Company A may have engaged in\n            misconduct in connection with the project in the Republic of\n            Albania. The purpose of the investigation was to allow the\n            WBG to determine if the WBG\u2019s framework regarding\n            anti-corruption has been violated. Company A submitted its\n            bid for the contract. The bid contained several\n            manufacturer\u2019s authorization forms (MAFs), including one\n            that purportedly was issued by Company B. Evidence suggests\n            that Company B informed the project implementing unit (PIU)\n            that it had not issued the MAF to Company A. Upon the PIU\u2019s\n            request to extend the bid validity for the third time,\n            Company A replied that it will not proceed with the third\n            extension of the bid validity and respective bid security\n            validity. Thus, Company A\u2019s bid was not considered for\n            further evaluation."}, "docdt": "2016-02-01T23:59:04Z"}
