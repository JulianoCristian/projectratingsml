          Re: GHANA - Credit No. 1976 GH
              (Forest Resource Management Project)
              Amendments to the Development Credit Agreement
               and the DANIDA Grant Agreement
Dear Dr. Botchwey:
  We refer to the Development Credit Agreement (Forest Resource
Management Project), dated February 16, 1989, and the DANIDA Grant
Agreement, dated September 26, 1989, between the Republic of Ghana
and the International Development Association in its own capacity
and as Administrator of Grant Funds Provided by the Danish
International Development Agency (the Association).
  Based on the discussions held between the Ghanian authorities and
a recent supervision mission of the Association, we hereby propose
the following amendments:
Development Credit Agreement
1.In Schedule 1, we propose to change the disbursement percentages
for Categories (1), (5, (9) and (13) from "100% of foreign
expenditures and 65% of local expenditures" to "100% of foreign
expenditures and 85% of local expenditures".
2.We propose furthermore to change the disbursement percentages for
Categories (4), (8), (12) and (16) from "80% in FYs 1989 and 1990,
75% in FY 1991, 65% in FY 1992, 40% in FY 1993 and 25% in FY 1994"
to "70% until December 31, 1994, and 50% thereafter".
3.In Schedule 6, we propose to consolidate the four Special
Accounts into one Special Account with an authorized allocation of
$1,100,000 equivalent.  Thus, paragraphs 1 (a) and (c) would read as
follows:
  "(a)  the term "Eligible Categories" means Categories (1) through
  (16) as such Categories are set forth in the table in paragraph
  1 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement;"
  "(c)  the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount equivalent
  to $1,100,000 to be withdrawn from the Credit Account and
  deposited into the Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3 (a)
  of this Schedule."
4.The change from several Special Accounts to only one Special
Account requires several editorial changes in the Development Credit
Agreement and the relevant sections, such as Section 1.02, Section
2.02 (b) as well as the rest of Schedule 6 shall be deemed to be
amended accordingly.
DANIDA Grant Agreement
5.In Schedule 1, we propose to change the disbursement percentages
for Categories (1), (5) and (9) from "100% of foreign expenditures
and 65% of local expenditures" to "100% of foreign expenditures and
85% of local expenditures".
6.We propose furthermore to change the disbursement percentages for
Categories (4), (8) and (12) from "80% in FYs 1989 and 1990, 75% in
Page  2
FY 1991, 65% in FY 1992, 40% in FY 1993 and 25% in FY 1994" to "70%
until December 31, 1994, and 50% thereafter".
7.In Schedule 2, we propose to consolidate the three Special
Accounts into one Special Account with an authorized allocation of
$450,000 equivalent.  Thus, paragraphs 1 (a) and (c) would read as
follows:
  "(a)  the term "Eligible Categories" means Categories (1) through
  (12) as such Categories are set forth in the table in paragraph
  1 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement;"
  "(c)  the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount equivalent
  to $450,000 to be withdrawn from the Credit Account and deposited
  into the Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this
  Schedule."
8.The change from several Special Accounts to only one Special
Account requires several editorial changes in the DANIDA Grant
Agreement and the relevant sections, such as Section 2.02 (b) as
well as the rest of Schedule 2 shall be deemed to be amended
accordingly.
  Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing amendments to
the Development Credit and DANIDA Grant Agreements by signing the
form of confirmation below on the enclosed copy and returning it to
us.  These amendments shall become effective upon receipt of the
signed copy by the Association.
                   Sincerely yours,
