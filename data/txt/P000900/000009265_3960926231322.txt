MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OI THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA
FOR A FOREST RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Ghana for SDR 30.6 million (US$39.4
million equivalent) is submitted for approvel. The iroposed credit is on
standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and would help finance a program
to strengthen the management of Ghana's forest resource. The project would
be cofinanced by ODA for SDR 5.5 million (US$7.1 million equivalent), and
DANIDA for SDR 6.4 million (US$8.3 million equival'ent).
2.        Background.  Ghana's forestry and logging sector contributes
about 6X of total GDP and ranks third after cocoa and minerals among
exports. Forests cover about 11.5 million ha or 481 of the country's total
area. The sector employs about 70,Ono persons and provides all of the
country's timber and a major part (7!Z) of its energy requirements. The
value of industrial forest products, fuelwood and charcoal, is about US$80
million and US$200 million, respectively. Export earnings represented
about US$100 million in 1987 or ab)ut 11X of total exports. In addition,
the forest contributes significantly to the protection of the environment.
The Government's strategy for the sector is to increase forest production
and productivity to the maximum consistent with its desire to protect the
environment. As one component of this strategy, the Government has, over
the past few years, initiated a program to rehabilitate the timber
industry. The program included policy and institutional reforms and the
importation of urgently needed equipment, vehicles and spare parts. The
resulting resurgence of both logllumber exports and wood processing raised
the annual rate of the high forest production by 20X, and by 1987 this
reached 1.35 million m3 exceeding the currently estimated level of annual
allowable cut of 1.1 million m3 by 20Z. However, due to inadequate
control, know-how and extremely low forestry fees, the log wastage is
considerable, estimated at 50% to 100%, bringing the actual cut to about
2.0 to 2.7 million m3 or about 180% to 250Z of the estimated annual
allowable cut. The annual allowable cut is under review and might be
changed depending on the outcome of the ongoing high forest inventory
exercise.  The recent accelerated exploitation of the industrial forest
could result in mining of this important natural resource if weaknesses of
sector institutions and sector policy environment prevent its proper
control and management. Indeed. when combined with the ongoing pressure on
forest areas by increasing numbers of cocoa and food crop farmers, it could
result in the destruction of the resource itself, with loss of export
revenues and potentially adverse effects on the environment. Increasing
population pressures contribute significantly to the erosion of the natural
resource base.



-2-
Rationale for IDA Involvement:  The project would not only help
implement key policy reforms but also address the sector's major
constraints as identified in the 1987 Forestry Sector Review. It would
emphasize the long-term sustained yield management of the resource to
maintain its social and economic contribution as well as to protect the
environment. IDA involvement is important to help ensure the design and
implementation of a suitable long-term sectoral development strategy. GOG
has indicated a strong desire for such a strategy which would provide the
basis ior future efficient management of the resource.  It has-turned to
IDA not only to organize external funding for the proposed project, but
also to coordinate with other donors and to obtain experience and advice in
these areas based on IDA's and Bank experience in similar situations
elsewhere in Africa and in other. parts of the world.
4.        Project Objectives:  The project aims at policy reform,
institutional building, strategy development and initial field activities
fort (i) stabilizing industrial forestry production and export earning in
accordance with a sustained yield policy; (ii) promoting conservation and
tree planting on farms to counteract fuelwood shortage and ecological
deterioration; and (iii) strengthening sector institutions to enable them
to carry out the necessary policy reforms, increase revenue generation,
improve protection and management of the forest and wildlife resources, and
lay the foundation for developing a methodology to quantify environmental
and ecological benefits. These would be achieved through: (i) policy
reform actions in the system of allocation of forest rights, ensuring
incentives for conservation and selective felling, and improved incentives
for staff responsible for systematic exploitation of the resource base;
(ii) provision of technical assistance for institution building and
improving management of the high forest, and policy changes in forestry
fees and concession allocation procedures that encourage reduction of
logging waste; (iii) development and implementation of a rural forestry
program with special emphasis on priority areas in the savanna zones; (iv)
the reactivation of forestry education and research; (v) specialized
technical assistance to develop a long-term sector development strategy
taking into account detailed inventory and other studies now ongoing.
To ensure adequate and timely funding for forests conservation and
environmental protection, the collected forestry fees would be paid into
the existing, although presently dormant, Forestry Fund and be used to
finance those FD current costs approved in the budget but for which release
of funds is delayed.
5.        Project Description:  The project would be implemented over six
years and comprise the following components: (i) Sector Reforms which
include changes in forest revenue policy, concession conduct and the
introduction of a free-market mechanism into the concession allocation
procedures, improvement in staff incentives to promote the recruitment of
the required professional and technical staff, and rationalization of the
timber trade policy. This component constitutes a quick disbursement
credit of US$15.0 million equivalent in two equal tranches: the first at
effectiveness and the second 18 months later (rid-1990); (ii) Forest



-3-
Management which includes accelerating the natural and industrial forest
inventory in and outside the reserves, updating the annual allowable cut
based on more thorough inventory work, preparation of harvesting schedules,
reduction of logging waste, rationalization of the timber concession and
rehabilitation of existing forest plantations; (iii) Rural Forestry which
involves the strengthening of the Forestry Department (FD) and the Ministry
of Agriculture (MOA) to encourage planting and protection of trees on land
outside forest reserves by rural populations, seedling production and
distribution, intensification of extension, and introduction, development
and demonstration of tested agroforestry packages; (iv) Strengthening
Forestry Sector Institutions which includes the establishment of a policy
formulation, planning, monitoring and evaluation unit in the Ministry of
Lands and Natural Resources; creation of a mechanism for collecting and
monitoring relevant data to enable the economic valuation of trees and
forest, and subsequent development of a methodology to quantify
environmental and ecological benefits; reorganization of the FD; and
provision for basic infrastructure (offices, staff housing, transportation
and equipment), technical assistance and training; (v) Forestry Education
and Training by building up the capacities of the main forestry education
and training institutions, the Institute of Renewable Natural Resources and
the Sunyani School of Forestry; and (vi) Applied Research which includes
the rehabilitation of the Forest Products Research Institute to provide
guidance for: (i) management of the natural forest resource; (ii) forestry
for rural developm'nt, and (iii) utilization of forest production.
6.        The total project cost is estimated at US$64.6 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$46.0 million (71Z). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and disbursement, as well as the disbursement
schedule are given in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Ghana are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. A map of Ghana showing the rainfall and
ecological zones is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 7295-GH,
dated November 17, 1988, is being distributed separately.
7.        Agreed Actions:  During negotiations basic agreements between the
Government and IDA on major reforms needed in the forestry sector were
obtained. The following required actions were agreed upon: (a) Conditions
of Effectiveness: (i) the raising of royalty rates from a level of about
two percent of the FOB value less costs of logging and transportation to a
level of six percent of the weighted average FOB value of exportable logs
less the costs of logging and.transportation; (ii) the introduction of a
market-oriented approach to concession allocation through the gazetting and
public announcement of the concession allocation procedures; (iii)
appointment of the Head of the Concession Unit in the FD; (iv) the minimum
weight for the concession rent offered by each applicant in the concession
allocation criteria to be established at 40 percent; (v) the introduction
of a special field and risk allowance of 20 percent of base salaries and
wages of field staff in the Forestry Department and the Game and Wildlife
Department; (vi) establishment of the Policy, Planning, Monitoring and
Evaluation Unit (PPMEU) within MLNR under the Chief Director (Technical);



-4-
(vii) appointment of the following key staff: forest management and logging
specialist (FD), sector planner (MLNR), rural forestry/agroforestry
specialist (FD), monitoring and evaluation specialist (MOA), and extens4on
and training specialist (HOA); (viii) secondment of a forest officer and
and two forestry technicians from FD to the Agro Forestrv Unit (AFU) within
MOA; (ix) signing of the ODA Memorandum of Understanding; ;x) payment of
initial deposits by GOG into FD, GWD, AFU, IRNR and FPRI acoounts; and (xi;
deposit of forestry fees into a Forestry Fund to be used by the FD as and
when necessary for operational and capital expenditures; and (b) Conditions
for Second Tranche: (i) increase in royalty rates to 12 percent of the
weighted average FOB value of exportable }Ogs less costs of logging and
transportation; (ii) the minimum weight for the concession rent offered by
each applicant in the concession allocation criteria to be raised to 50
percent, and a timetable submitted to IDA for a further increase to 60
percent; (iii) submission of an action plan to IDA for improvements in the
FD and GWD incentive system and in the recruitment of professional and
technical staff; and (iv) completion of a study on the wood processing
industry by Government and discussion with IDA on its findings, and on a
long term strategy and action plan for conserving the forest resource and
raising the efficiency of the wood processing industry based on these
findings. It was agreed that no further ban on log exports beyond the 18
species already subject to the log export ban as of October 1, 1988. would
be instituted until after the completion of the study, its joint review by
Government and IDA, and mutual agreement by both on an action plan based on
its findings.
8.        Justification:  Without a sustained yield approach to forest
management, there is considerable risk, that within a period of 25-30
years, that the resource base will be significantly eroded in some agro-
climatic zones, because of the recent upsurge in the industry. Unless
counter measures are taken, fuelwood shortages will increase and there will
be a national fuelwood deficit towards the end of the century. The
destruction of trees will pose a threat to long-term agriculture
development in particular, and the environment in general. The project's
main Justification would be to establish the importance of sustained yield
management and to initiate policy reform actions and field activities to
conserve the resource base while improving the data base and undertaking
the detailed analysis to develop a sound long-term policy and strategy.
While a comprehensive methodology is still to be established by which the
full benefits of the impact of resource management efforts - their likely
scale and timing - can be fully quantified, little doubt exists about the
validity of this approach. The quantifiable benefits which are derived
from (i) agroforestry activities; and (ii) reduction of log waste at the
logging site are estimated to produce a net present value of US$21.0
million over 15 years representing an ERR of about 21 percent.
9.       Risks:  The risks of the project involve primarily the
uncertainty concerning the pace at which Government would be able to
proceed with increasing forest fees and implementing other policy measures,
due to a perceived risk that these could lead to a setback in exports or
revival of the forest industries. On the rural forestry side there are



-5-
risks associated with a slow response because fully tested packages of
appropriate agro-forestry practices for farmers to adopt are not readily
available and, therefore, there might be a reduced project impact. These
risks are to be minimized by (a) building awareness and publicizing the
consequences of delayed action including the very loss of direct export and
employment benefits, (b) close monitoring of the resource base and sectoral
performance, and (c) project focus on testing potential technology packages
for farmers to adopt.
10.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Aesociation and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
