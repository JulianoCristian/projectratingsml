The project was the first Bank project\n            directly in support of the Ghana's forestry sector. The\n            project was intended to sharpen the focus of natural\n            resource management in Ghana through the achievement of\n            three main objectives: (i) managing industrial forestry\n            production based on a sustainable yield policy; (ii)\n            promoting conservation and fuelwood tree planting to\n            counteract fuelwood shortages and environmental degradation;\n            (iv) and sector institutional strengthening and reform. The\n            overall assessment of Project outcome is that despite\n            initial implementation delays, the project has\n            satisfactorily achieved the bulk of its major objectives.\n            The Bank's performance in identification and project\n            preparation was generally satisfactory. The Borrower's\n            performance, while unsatisfactory in the early years of the\n            project, was generally satisfactory from the mid-term review\n            to the end of the project. The main lessons learned from\n            FRMP are as follows: (i) to properly address natural\n            resource management issues and identify and test sustainable\n            solutions, a long-term perspective must be taken; (ii) the\n            underlying basis for any Natural Resources Management\n            Project (NRM) is an effective policy environment and\n            efficiently operating sector institutions; (iii)\n            institutional strengthening often means substantive\n            fundamental change to how institutions are organized and\n            managed and therefore requires good planning and sufficient\n            implementation time; (iv) sustainable NRM can only be\n            achieved when resource-owning local communities are fully\n            involved in the development of resource management plans and\n            receive an equitable share of proceeds when the resource is\n            harvested; and (v) it is imperative that NRM ministries and\n            agencies responsible for setting policy and implementing\n            development programs have effective support in resource\n            economics and planning. NRM project is conceived as a 10 to\n            15 years program, designed as a three-phase Adaptable\n            Program Loan."}, "docdt": "1998-02-27T00:00:00Z"}
