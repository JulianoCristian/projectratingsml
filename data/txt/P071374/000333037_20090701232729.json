HIV/AIDS\n            Project for Rwanda were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: one of the most important elements of\n            Rwanda's commitment was its poverty strategy, which\n            emphasized inclusion of the poor and the vulnerable within\n            communities, associations, cooperatives, etc. With respect\n            to HIV/AIDS, the strategy's focus on vulnerable\n            populations rather than individuals is viewed as one of the\n            main reasons for the decline in the stigma associated with\n            HIV/AIDS. With respect to the support for income-generating\n            activities, the emphasis on associations of People Living\n            with HIV and AIDS (PLWHA) has not guaranteed success, but\n            has contributed to many of the successes. Conversely, where\n            efforts concentrated on individuals (payment of school fees\n            for selected students), many of the problems seen in other\n            Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program (MAP) have occurred. While\n            the Bank is often criticized for its slow and complex\n            procedures, the MAP demonstrated several of its comparative\n            advantages, particularly its flexibility and willingness to\n            support Government strategies. In particular, interviewees\n            cited the Bank's early willingness: (i) to address\n            treatment and care holistically through measures to\n            strengthen health systems and health personnel; (ii) to\n            support the Government's policy of decentralizing\n            services and program coordination; and (iii) to promote\n            Government initiatives to consolidate procurement, test and\n            scale up performance-based financing, and improve health\n            care financing through mutuelles. In a number of these\n            instances, interviewees noted that the Bank's\n            non-financial support was at least as essential as its\n            financial support for persuading other partners."}, "docdt": "2009-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
