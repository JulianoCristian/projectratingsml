1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1     Context at Appraisal

1.      Project preparation was carried out during 2001-02 by a Government confronted with: (i) the
political, economic, and social consequences of war and genocide; and (ii) an HIV/AIDS epidemic of
disturbing proportions. Existing data from UNAIDS indicates that in 1999, 400 000 people in Rwanda
were living with HIV/AIDS of which roughly 50% were women and 13% children under fifteen; and
about half of those infected were believed to have developed AIDS. HIV prevalence rates in Kigali and
other cities were estimated to be 16% and 9% respectively based on sentinel surveillance of antenatal
care clinics.

2.      The social effects of the combined crises were potentially overwhelming: (i) life expectancy was
declining (from 54 in 1991 to 42 in 2000); (ii) per capita income was falling (from about US$ 370 in
1990 to roughly US$ 250 in 1999) with 60% of households estimated to be below the poverty line (as
compared with 40% in 1985; (iii) a third of the households in Rwanda were headed by females; and (iv)
approximately 270,000 children under the age of 15 years had been orphaned by the AIDS epidemic.
Finally, the rapid rise in HIV infection rates was paralleled by a worsening TB epidemic. The combined
effects of an increased demand for services and an adversely affected capacity to supply such care were
putting an enormous strain on the health care system.

3.      Since the emergence of the first AIDS cases in the mid 1980s, the Government of Rwanda had
demonstrated its political and technical leadership in the fight against the epidemic through:

     establishment (in 1987) of the National Aids Control Program under the auspices of the Ministry
        of Health

     restructuring (in April 2001) of the national program into: (i) the National HIV/AIDS
        Commission (CNLS) under the political auspices of the Presidency and the technical auspices of
        the Ministry of Health; and (ii) the Center for Treatment and Research on AIDS (TRAC) under
        the auspices of the Ministry of Health; and

     adoption of a series of medium-term plans emphasizing: (i) blood transfusion safety, health
        education, and epidemiological surveillance (1988-92); (ii) preventive activities with a focus on
        minimizing the socio-economic impact of AIDS (1993-97); (iii) a multi-sectoral approach with
        increased responsibilities for the health districts (1998-2001); and (iv) an integrated strategy of
        prevention, care and treatment, and mitigation (2002-06), which has subsequently been updated
        (2005-2009).

4.      Other national policy and strategy documents (e.g., behavior change, condom distribution,
treatment protocols and standards, family protection, etc.) were also in progress or being considered.

5.      The medium-term plans implemented by the Government of Rwanda sought to reduce the
transmission of HIV in the country, but had not achieved the desired level of HIV prevention and care
required to stabilize the epidemic within the country. Previous Bank financing of HIV/AIDS included:
(i) components in several projects (notably rural water and hygiene and enterprise development); and (ii)
the Human Resource Development Project (with an HIV/AIDS component), which was subsequently
restructured with supplementary funds to increase resources for health-related elements of HIV/AIDS1
prevention, including blood transfusion, condoms, STI treatment, and surveillance. In the pre-MAP, pre

Global Fund, and pre PEPFAR period, other financial support was relatively dispersed among the UN,
seven European bilateral agencies, and USAID.

6.        The Bank's participation in the fight against HIV/AIDS was consistent with ongoing dialogue,
particularly on human and social development, which resulted in the Rwanda's first Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP) in June 2002 and the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) in November
2002. While the preparation team considered both the approaches used previously by the Bank (to
expand activities within the framework of ongoing community development projects and to finance an
operation focusing on the health aspects of the HIV/AIDS epidemic), technical, organizational2, and
financing considerations3 indicated that a MAP style project be used.

1.2       Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

7.        The Project Development Objectives presented in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) are:
(i) to strengthen prevention measures in order to slow down the spread of HIV/AIDS, and (ii) to expand
support and care for those infected or affected by HIV/AIDS. To these ends, the project proposed to
support the implementation of Rwanda's Strategic HIV/AIDS Plan (2002-06) and a multi-sectoral
approach to finance activities undertaken by public and private organizations and by civil society.

8.        The following outcome indicators and a long list of output indicators to measure project
performance on prevention and on care and mitigation were proposed in the PAD4.




2In particular, the PAD cited the creation of the National HIV/AIDS Commission (CNLS) as "an important milestone in mounting a
concerted national response and signals the government's commitment to a multi-sectoral approach.
3The use of grant funding for this MAP operation is in line with the IDA 13 grant allocation to Rwanda as a debt-vulnerable, IDA-
only low-income country and complies with the grant implementation guidelines of August 12, 2002.
4The list of outcome indicators in the body of the PAD is not the same as in Annex 1. In addition, the list of outcome indicators
appeared as Schedule 4 in the draft Development Grant Agreement discussed during negotiations; this list was not included in the
final DGA but was included as a side-letter.


                                                                                                                                  2

                                                   Table 1: Summary of PAD PDO Indicators

 Prevention
 By 2008, 70% of men (15-49 years) report condom use the last time they had sex with an unmarried, non-cohabitating
 partner in the last twelve months (2000 baseline of 51%)

 By 2008, 40% of never-married young men (15-24 years) report condom use at last sex with a non-commercial partner
 (2000 baseline of 19.6%)
 By 2008, 25% of young (15-24 years) never-married women report condom use at last sex with a non-commercial partner
 (2000 baseline of 11.3%)

 By 2008, the reported age of first sex among young men (15-19 years) is 14 years (2000 baseline of 13 years at first sex)

 By 2008, the reported age of first sex among young women (15-19 years) is 15 years (2000 baseline of 14 years at first sex)

 Care and support

 By 2008, 80% of STI clients are appropriately diagnosed and treated according to the Syndromic Management approach
 (2002 baseline of 66.5%)

 By 2008, 85% of smear-positive Tuberculosis cases complete the Directly Observed Treatment (Short-term) protocol (2002
 baseline of 75%)

 By 2008, there will be a reduction of 20% in differential school attendance ratio between male orphans aged 10-14 (who
 have lost both parents) and non-orphans (2000 baseline of 0.76)

  By 2008, there will be a reduction of 20% in differential school attendance ratio between female orphans aged 10-14 (who
 have lost both parents) and non-orphans (2000 baseline of 0.86)



9.        Data on the PDO indicators are presented in Annex 10 along with the sources of data and how
indicators were modified during project implementation and approval of additional financing. Data on
PDO and intermediate outcome indicators are also presented in the Data Sheet.

1.3       Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

10.       The PDO were not formally revised during implementation of the original grant; one of the
original PDO was modified (to include females) and two PDO indicators (one of which was already
reflected in Annex 1 of the PAD) were added at the time of the additional financing grant.
Modifications occurred as additional data became available, as the national HIV M&E framework
evolved, and to be in alignment with internationally recognized definitions (such as the United Nations
General Assembly Special Session [UNGASS] on HIV/AIDS). In line with the Bank's OP 13.60, these
refinements in definition and wording to harmonize project indicators with the country M&E system did
not require any formal restructuring measures since neither the populations referred to by the indicators
nor the substance of what was measured by the indicators were changed.

1.4       Main Beneficiaries and Benefits

11.       Consistent with GoR policy linking HIV/AIDS interventions to the overall issue of poverty
reduction, the PAD emphasized broad support for vulnerable groups (particularly rural and poor) as well
as specific assistance to defined target populations.5 The PAD's discussion of beneficiaries emphasized
institutions, communities, and individuals (organized as associations or cooperatives) as potential
beneficiaries of project assistance aimed at dealing more effectively with the disease burden:




5The PAD focused in particular on PLWHA and on women (particularly young women and poor female heads of
households).


                                                                                                                                3

     Line ministries, public sector institutions, and private sector enterprises would benefit from: (i)
         mainstreaming HIV/AIDS activities to promote desired individual and institutional behavior
         change; and (ii) increased capabilities to manage the epidemic in the longer term;

     Communities and other stakeholders (including associations or cooperatives) would benefit from
         the technical and financial support provided through the sub-grants to improve the quality and
         extend the lives of persons living with HIV (most of whom are in their peak productive years)
         and affected by HIV/AIDS;

     The most vulnerable groups (including youth, women and their newborns, widows, orphans and
         vulnerable children, and key populations at risk, such as commercial sex workers, transport
         sector workers, and uniformed personnel (military and police) would benefit from targeted
         interventions (focusing primarily on prevention awareness and safe sex) to reduce the number of
         future AIDS cases and the resulting social costs and financial burdens on families; and

     Persons living with HIV and their families would benefit from care, treatment and mitigation
         measures (including improved access to palliative care, treatment of STIs and opportunistic
         infections as well as psycho-social support) financed by the project.

1.5      Original Components

12.      Component 1: Public Sector Support (US$ 7.0 million; 21.9%) initiates, facilitates, and/or
supports the mainstreaming of HIV/AIDS activities into line ministries and other public sector
institutions with a view to bringing about desired changes in both individual and institutional behavior.
The component finances: (i) capacity building within public sector agencies, including carrying out
sector impact assessments, policy formulation, and training of staff in the preparation, execution and
monitoring of work plans; (ii) implementation of HIV/AIDS annual work plans; and (iii) IEC and BCC
campaigns including promotion of condoms, distribution of information and gender issues related to
HIV/AIDS. This component supported institutions at national level (CNLS and the Ministries) and the
program coordinating structures in 3 provinces before expanding to 9 (of 12) provinces.

13.      Component 2: Health Sector HIV/AIDS Care and Treatment (US$ 10.9 million; 34.1%)
supports implementation of work plans prepared by the Ministry of Health and executed out through
public-private sector partnerships to: (i) carry out diagnosis, care and treatment HIV/AIDS patients
including sexually transmitted infections, opportunistic infections and tuberculosis; (ii) finance
programs to assure the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission; (iii) carry out HIV voluntary
testing and counseling services; (iv) improve HIV testing, counseling, diagnosis, and monitoring of
patients by laboratories and blood banks; (v) finance minor rehabilitation/refurbishing of sites which
will serve for the provision of antiretroviral therapy; (vi) improve surveillance and operational research;
and (g) implement activities under the Waste Management Plan. This component was concentrated on
the three provinces mentioned above and on 31 health facilities within these provinces.

14.      Component 3: Civil Society Support (US$ 10.7 million; 33.4%) funds implementation of
HIV/AIDS sub projects prepared, implemented, and managed by beneficiary communities and
stakeholders comprising community groups, youth groups, women's groups, associations of People
Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), religious groups, labor
unions, and private enterprises. Support for these community-driven local initiatives is expected to: (i)
emphasize preventive measures to facilitate behavior change; (ii) deliver psycho-social support, home-
based care, and other assistance for vulnerable groups; and (iii) provide social and financial support for
infected and affected groups. This component was national in scope but with a particular focus on the
three target provinces: Butare (now South Province), Cyangugu (West Province) and Umutara (East
Province).



                                                                                                          4

15.     Component 4: Program Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$ 3.4 million; 10.6%)
provides financial and technical support for: (i) the operations of the National HIV/AIDS Commission
(CNLS) to coordinate the national program and the provincial (CPLS) and district-level entities (CDLS)
to assist them to coordinate local activities, carry out advocacy and facilitate social mobilization; (ii)
strengthening overall monitoring and evaluation of the program; and (iii) for establishing the Project
Management Unit to facilitate the programming, coordination, and monitoring of project activities.

1.6     Revised Components

16.     During the preparation of the supplemental funding proposal, the same four components were
retained, with the overall objectives modified to take into account current project achievements and
expected future results.

1.7     Other significant changes

17.     Amendment of the DGA. In August 2004, the Government requested an amendment to the
DGA (August 2004) in order to harmonize procurement procedures for the MAP and Global Fund
projects and to adopt simplified and more flexible procurement procedures for works, goods
(particularly ARVs and related products), and services; the modified procurement arrangements were
particularly concerned with threshold levels and aggregate amounts. In line with the Bank's new
procurement procedures (May 1, 2004) and guidelines for the acquisition of HIV/AIDS Medicines and
Related Supplies (February 2004), the request was approved by the Bank (December 2004).

18.     Supplemental financing. A request for supplemental financing in the amount of US$10 million
equivalent was received by the Bank in December 2006 and approved by the Board on February 8, 2007.
The unanticipated financing gap resulted from much stronger than expected demand for and absorptive
capacity of MAP funding, particularly for: (i) prevention activities in priority sectors (e.g. defense and
police) by consolidating VCT and strengthening condom promotion; (ii) funding school fees and income
generating activities demanded by civil society groups while focusing on microfinance to enhance
sustainability; and (iii) strengthening the capacities of the newly established districts and other key
coordinating bodies.

19.     The additional financing was consistent with: (i) the Rwanda Interim Strategy Note (Report No.
3533 1-RW, August 16, 2006) discussed by the Board on September 7, 2006; and (ii) the revised
National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan (2005-2009). It also took into account the availability of funding
from other development partners in an effort to minimize duplication and assure harmonization.

2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

20.     Background analysis. During project preparation, the Government and the Bank discussed
their divergent views concerning the proposed project coordinating structure and the modalities for rapid
project implementation;6 but by Board presentation, Rwanda clearly met the MAP eligibility criteria
(Government commitment, a comprehensive strategy, and stakeholder involvement in a national
coordinating structure) for accessing the second phase of the Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program for the
Africa Region (established by the Board of Directors on December 20, 2001).



6Among the institutional issues were the creation of a separate Ministry for HIV/AIDS and the specific roles of CNLS,
MOH, and the PMU; among the implementation issues was the Government's reluctance to subcontract the procurement
and financial management functions.


                                                                                                                    5

21.      Project preparation was initiated in December 2000, soon after the establishment of the National
AIDS Commission/CNLS. A PHRD grant was signed in April 2001 with the objectives of: (i)
developing a multi-sectoral approach and efficient project implementation and evaluation mechanisms;
and (ii) conducting various analyses (economic benefits, social and cultural factors, gender implications,
etc.). In December 2001, a high-level Rwandan delegation visited Bank headquarters to discuss the
proposed project, but concerns about the size and scope of the project as well as (and most importantly)
the institutional arrangements for implementation resulted in an abrupt halt to project preparation.
When agreement was reached on the institutional arrangements in August 2002, only 12% of the grant
had been disbursed; the grant was amended to extend the closing date and to reallocate the proceeds for
preparation activities to include several broad assessments (needs of young children, the impact of
HIV/AIDS on health sector and households, and links between reproductive health and HIV/AIDS) and
two specific requirements (the feasibility of introducing ARV therapy and the elaboration of a waste
management plan). Though final results from some of the PHRD studies became available after the
PAD was finalized, 7 the PAD cites the operational manual, the ARV feasibility study, the institutional
study of CNLS, and the waste management plan.8

22.      Discussion in the PAD relied mainly on: (i) existing Government policy documents; (ii) data
from both small-scale and national surveys (including surveillance studies and the RDHS 2000); and
(iii) lessons learned from MAPs in general and from project experience in Rwanda by multilateral and
bilateral agencies as well as by NGOs.

23.      Project design. The PAD identified three key sectoral issues to be addressed by the project: (i)
weak implementation and institutional capacities; (ii) insufficient partnerships with civil society; and
(iii) financial barriers to accessing health services. The lengthy preparation focused particularly (and
occasionally with intense discussion and negotiation) on the institutional issues, and the detailed
discussion in the PAD reflects the agreements reached on these matters.

24.      The MAP design complemented the Poverty Reduction Support Credit/Grant's support to the
health sector, with the MAP intended to pilot innovative approaches and the PRSC intended to support
and mainstream broader health reforms. Specific innovations and significant lessons learned from the
previous Bank project or other projects in Rwanda were addressed in the PAD. These lessons included
assessments that:

      a successful social fund experience, managed by the PLNS to channel funds for HIV/AIDS
         activities to community groups demonstrated both the important role which community
         associations can play and the need to improve their capacities to scale up such an approach; and

      the growing importance of prepayment (mutuelle) schemes provided very positive prospects for
         addressing issues of equity and financial accessibility of services.

25.      Other lessons from the previous project and involving somewhat broader sectoral issues were
addressed by the PRSC, including those indicating that:

      the quantity, quality, and motivation of human resources must be addressed comprehensively to
         ensure a sustained development of the health sector; and




7Early supervision missions followed up on the results of some of the other PHRD studies, particularly with respect to
the child needs assessment and the waste management plan. See AM from June 2003.
8The government's project proposal noted that stakeholders participated extensively during the preparation of the
project through consultations in each province; meetings with representatives of public agencies and private enterprises,
local groups, women's associations, and youth clubs. The draft operational manual was discussed with representatives of
civil society to incorporate their views.


                                                                                                                       6

     an integrated and holistic approach to reproductive health and HIV/AIDS activities at various
         levels of the health system has a number of very positive effects, including avoiding stigma for
         services that are exclusively AIDS-oriented and addressing the range of maternal and child
         health needs.

26.      The PAD did not treat several issues in great detail, including vulnerable groups, nutrition, and
home-based care, but these were addressed after the interim evaluation in 2005. Similarly, supply chain
management issues were barely mentioned in the PAD but were developed in detail by the TRAC/CDC
ARV feasibility study, and proposals were in fact being implemented prior to project effectiveness.

27.      Other design issues, identified by a QER conducted in December 2002, included: (i) phasing of
project activities, particularly given the human resource constraint; (ii) proposed support for ARV
therapy and particularly "how far the envelope can be pushed on this critical and sensitive topic"; (iii)
lack of "appropriate interventions" to address specific vulnerable groups as well as end-of-life care; (iv)
institutional and implementation arrangements in general and the lack of a capacity-building component
in particular; and (v) the ability of proposed community health financing schemes to absorb new HIV
services.

28.      The decision meeting in January 2003 revisited the size, scope, and institutional arrangements
for the project as well as the measures of readiness for negotiations. In anticipation of the CDC analysis
of ARV feasibility, the grant was increased by some US$ 10 million, seizing on the opportunity offered
by the new openness internationally (post Barcelona) and within the Bank to fund ARV treatment.9 .
The institutional arrangements would be subject to frequent, interim reviews to identify corrective
actions to improve implementation; and an interim evaluation would occur 18 months after grant
effectiveness.10 During negotiations in February/March 2003, the grant was increased from US$ 20
million to US$ 30.5 million to allow for the financing of a comprehensive HIV/AIDS Care and
Treatment component, including anti-retroviral (ARV) therapy. The project implementation period was
maintained at 5 years.

29.      Perhaps the weakest aspect of the PAD (in retrospect) was the assessment of risks, which seems
somewhat divorced from the issues, proposals, and prospects discussed in the text. Among the risks
identified, only the one related to the ineffectiveness of preventive measures seems to have been
appropriately assessed; the others seem not to have occurred or were over estimated.11 The QER's
recommendation to cite the technical and financial risks of including ARV treatment in the project was
not included in the final PAD.

30.      Quality at entry assessment. A quality at entry assessment for the supplemental grant was
conducted by the QAG in April 2007. In rating the quality at entry of the supplemental as Satisfactory
(2), the QAG rated the Bank's inputs and processes as highly satisfactory and the project's elements as
either highly satisfactory (strategic relevance and timeliness; policy and institutional aspects; and
implementation arrangements) or satisfactory (technical, financial and economic aspects; fiduciary




9The importance of this scale-up was noted by several persons interviewed, who mentioned the extreme bitterness felt
by the growing numbers of PLWHA during the period 2001-2003 as the existence of life-saving drugs became generally
known but were available only for the privileged few.
10At the Decision Meeting, a supervision budget of US$ 150,000 was agreed on, given the complexity of the operation
and the need for intensive follow-up.
11The cover memorandum for the supplemental financing noted that, "the majority of the risks identified at appraisal
has not materialized or have been mitigated as capacities have grown, political commitment has remained firm, and
creative ways to overcome human resources constraints have been introduced. The national HIV/AIDS commission
(CNLS), which was a young institution at the outset, has proven its capacity to effectively coordinate a large and
growing portfolio"


                                                                                                                    7

aspects; risk assessment; poverty, gender and social development; and environmental aspects).12 The
QAG highlighted the need for: (i) more intensive supervision of the environmental aspects; (ii) better
documentation of the gender and social dimensions of the project; and (iii) intensive dialogue in-country
and within the Bank to address the issue of sustainability.

2.2      Implementation

31.      Disbursement overview. The original grant (H029RW) was approved by the Board on March
31, 2003 in the amount of SDR 22.2 million (US$ 30.5 million equivalent) and became effective on
August 11, 2003; a supplemental grant (H2710 RW) was approved by the Board on February 8, 2007 in
the amount of SDR 6.7 million (US$ 10.0 million equivalent) and became effective on July 5, 2007.
The disbursement profile is presented in the Data Sheet.

32.      Delays in meeting effectiveness conditions (especially in organizing procurement and finalizing
the first year project implementation plan13) and in ratifying the grant agreement resulted in relatively
slow disbursement during 2003. Disbursement increased rapidly in 2004 and 2005, and by early 2006
the ISRs were estimating that the project would be fully disbursed in 3 years rather than the 5 originally
planned. Similarly, delays in the ratification of the supplemental grant resulted in relatively slow
disbursement in the first half of 2007, though efforts were made to protect critical activities such as
AIDS treatment, school fees for OVC, and condom promotion. These delays had the effect of
stimulating discussion on the sustainability of financing the MAP activities after project closing.

33.      Implementation overview. The initial implementation arrangements were modified as a result
of two major developments: (i) the rapid increase in demand for project financing of the different
components; and (ii) the Government's decision to decentralize the administrative structure to30 districts
after January 1, 2006. As a result, the originally envisioned implementation arrangements (e.g., phasing
and procedures) were continually adapted, as the project took advantage of MAP's flexibility for
learning by doing, which had been emphasized from the outset at the project launch workshop. Several
examples demonstrate the rapid expansion project implementation, followed by modified procedures to
allow for faster scale-up:

34.      Sub projects. While initially organized in a phased manner, these interventions expanded
rapidly, with the only constraint being the need to accompany this expansion with qualified accounting
capabilities (particularly for the line ministries and the CPLS). By August 2004, the project had begun
to modify the initial procedures to meet demand for project funds, including: (i) improving the quality of
the sub projects (better distribution, revised financial ceilings, etc.); and (ii) decentralizing the
procedures for the selection of sub-projects. These arrangements were later confirmed at the interim
review of the project.

35.      Care and treatment. Design of care and treatment continued into the implementation phase as
the initial AMs described progress in: (i) the selection of "pilot" sites, the detailed assessment of
laboratory capabilities and equipment needs (October 2003); (ii) the quantification of drug needs and
definition of arrangements with the Clinton Foundation (December 2003); and (iii) the initiation of
patient enrolment and the accompanying introduction of performance-based service agreements (May



12The poverty, gender and social development aspects and the environmental aspects were upgraded to satisfactory by
the QAG after "strong disagreement" by the TT with the original conclusions, particularly those proposing to: (i) "report
the information on the results of treatment, prevention, and mitigation efforts by gender and other social dimensions ";
and (ii) assess "adverse social impacts such as exclusion of key groups, opposition by influential stakeholders, benefit
capture and corruption, political instability or conflict."
13There were also lingering concerns about establishing a PMU dedicated to the MAP as opposed to combining the
MAP and GF projects.


                                                                                                                        8

2004) to ensure that enrolment and service delivery targets are met. Delays were encountered with
respect to the minor rehabilitation of ART sites, the delivery of the necessary equipment, and the
finalization of the performance based contracts; in each instance, the project found solutions to ensure
that these problems did not hinder the expansion of treatment activities. By October 2004, 500 patients
were on ARV treatment and the remaining sites were ready to start enrolling patients; in addition, the
drop in ARV prices had as a consequence a doubling (from 2,350 to 5,000) of the number of patients to
be financed through the MAP. By project closing, more than 9,000 patients were being treated in 31
health centers, using a nurse led model of care. Care and treatment arrangements were confirmed at the
interim review.

36.       Interim review. The interim review was conducted in May 2005 and served both to assess the
project's progress and, as noted above, to confirm the evolving implementation arrangements:

      Sub projects: Concerns about the focus (predominantly on capacity-building and awareness-
          raising) and quality of the subprojects led to the introduction of annual priorities to correct any
          imbalances in the implementation of the previous year's plan. For instance, the 2005 plan sought
          to focus on: (i) target groups (e.g., youth, women, OVCs, mobile workers, prisoners, refugees,
          CSW); (ii) interventions expected to generate tangible results (i.e. condom promotion, VCT, and
          treatment; and (iii) relatively neglected areas (OVC support, adherence support for patients on
          ARVs, HVC, alternative VCT strategies).

      Care and treatment: In line with Government policy, there was agreement to: (i) decentralize the
          provision of ARVs to health facilities to improve geographical access reinforce community; (ii)
          introduce the performance-based contractual approach; and (iii) reinforce community support to
          provide, in collaboration with other partners, a comprehensive package of services (nutrition,
          patient education, psycho-social support, income generating activities).14

37.       In addition, several measures to improve arrangements and procedures for project management
were agreed on, including: (i) consolidating the specific project PMUs into a Multi-Sectoral Response
Unit; (ii) improving financial management (with the installation of TOMPRO) and increased thresholds
for the special account; and (iii) strengthening monitoring and evaluation (see below).

38.       Mid-term review. The mid-term review was conducted in August 2006 with objectives similar
to the interim review except that the mid-term review sought to address prospects and options for
sustaining existing investments. An excellent preliminary paper (May 2006) identified four key issues:
(i) new epidemiological data indicating radically different prevalence data of 3% rather than 11-13%;
(ii) new development partners (PEPFAR in particular); (iii) new country context with the promulgation
of the organization of the 106 districts and 12 provinces into 30 districts; and (iv) a new national
HIV/AIDS strategic plan presented to Parliament in December 2005 for the period 2005-2009.

39.       As a result of the mid-term review, a number of important measures were agreed on to guide
future implementation:

      with the epidemiological data confirming the conclusions of the earlier 18 month interim review,
          it was agreed that the emphasis of MAP sub projects be shifted from IEC to impact mitigation
          (e.g. payment of school fees, access to health insurance, income generating activities, HIV
          testing, etc.);




14The AM of December 2005 noted that some 2600 patients were benefiting from the full range of services, including
psycho-social support, home-based visits, referrals (and transportation where necessary) to ARV sites, financial support
for CD4 tests and hospitalization, nutritional support and income-generating activities. (p. 4). The AM also indicated
that a full-fledged nutritional component was being prepared, but no additional information is available.


                                                                                                                      9

     with the emergence of a range of development partners, it was agreed that: (i) MAP funding
         would focus on interventions not typically supported by others (public sector work plans,
         income generating activities for civil society groups); and (ii) the MAP and GF project
         implementation units would be merged when it was determined that this would be beneficial;
         and

     with the progress in the decentralization process, MAP would provide new investments to
         support the CNLS decentralization of HIV/AIDS M&E capacity in the 30 new districts.

40.      Only a few elements marred the otherwise smooth implementation of the project: (i) in early
2005, changes in the CNLS management were announced, but the underlying issues were resolved, and
the staffing of the MAP PMU remained unchanged; (ii) in 2007, delays in ratifying the supplemental
grant resulted in the downgrading of the project IP rating (from S to MS); (iii) financial management
(see below); and (iv) the constant delays in counterpart financing,15 as summarized in the table below:

                                Table 2: Status of the counterpart funding (in '000)

                     DGA           2003      2004       2005       2006       2007    Total     %

               Source: Project Coordination Unit


Overall, despite repeated recommendations in the Bank documents, the Government only contributed
(as of December 2007) 41.2% of the expected counterpart funding.

2.3      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

41.      Citing international experience concerning the difficulties of achieving a measurable impact in
terms of reductions in HIV prevalence rates within the life of this project, the PAD opted to monitor a
set of outcome, output and process indicators. The determination of these indicators benefited from
previous work with TRAC (surveillance, ICT and quality control of HIV testing) in close collaboration
with the CDC and the USAID-funded MEASURE Project. The definition of several outcome and
output indicators was modified during project implementation to improve clarity, conform to
international standards and to use available data.

42.      Monitoring. To emphasize the importance of monitoring and evaluation from the outset, MAP:
(i) established a dedicated team, which expanded over time from 1 to 3 people; (ii) financed annual
M&E work plans and budgets; and (iii) recruited a communications specialist to use the results for
information and advocacy purposes. The team received training (both in Rwanda and via international
exchanges), developed an M&E training curriculum, and provided training to MAP implementing
institutions.

43.      To strengthen monitoring, the Bank financed a series of GAMET consultancies between
February 2004 and November 2006. Initially, the assistance was intended to: (i) simplify, better define,
and ensure consistency between the original PAD indicators and those used for monitoring the national
HIV response; (ii) harmonize reporting formats and procedures; and (iii) improve the quality of data
verification and analysis. By February 2005, it was determined that the increase from 13 to 70+ MAP




15The counterpart funding requirement applied only to the original grant; the Bank funded 100% of the supplemental
grant.



                                                                                                                  10

implementers and the impending decentralization process would overwhelm the manual M&E system
initially designed, and assistance was provided to automate the system with increased staff to supervise
and verify data collection and analysis.

44.      During project implementation, four types of periodic reports were produced: (i) quarterly
reports summarizing physical and financial results for CEPEX; (ii) quarterly Financial and Monitoring
Reports (FMR) for the World Bank; (iii) summary quarterly activity reports for the Prime Minister's
Office (for incorporation into the Government's report); and (iv) detailed quarterly activity reports for
the Ministry of Finances, the Ministry of Health, CNLS, and the World Bank. A MAP database was
established with data on all MAP activities and expenditures. In addition to project monitoring, the
Bank emphasized knowledge-sharing (through the development of case studies of MAP success stories
and the beneficiary assessment). In spite of the serious efforts that went in to monitoring, data for some
output and process indicators are not available.

45.      Evaluation. As can be seen in Annexes 2a and 10 consistent output data over the course of the
project is only partly available. The MAP did not finance project-specific surveys and surveillance data
collection in an effort to harmonize with other monitoring and evaluation efforts. The result was that
outcome data are limited (with the exception of the tuberculosis data) to the two DHSs, one in 2000 and
another in 2005, (the latter was partly financed by the project). The next formal DHS scheduled for 2010
would be able to provide definitive endline data for the project. A "mini-DHS" was conducted in 2008,
financed by USAID, but did not unfortunately include any HIV/AIDS questions. While outside the
control of the Bank the lack of HIV/AIDS questions on the 2008 survey represents a missed opportunity.

46.      Beginning in late 2005, the Bank initiated a randomzed controlled impact evaluation of the
effects of results based financing (including performance-based bonuses to health workers) on: (i) the
public health care system, at the provider and facility level; and (ii) the health status and utilization
trends of both the general population and those living with HIV/AIDS. Baseline data were collected in
2006 and a follow-up survey was successfully conducted in 2008; results from the impact evaluation
will be made available later in 2009 but not in time for inclusion in this report.

2.4      Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

47.      Environment. The environment category of the Project at the time of appraisal was B, with the
handling and disposal of HIV/AIDS infected materials being the most significant environmental issue.
A medical waste management plan was prepared and identified: (i) weaknesses in personnel, equipment
and supplies; (ii) poor knowledge of risks and a lack of procedures and mitigation measures for waste
management; and (iii) an absence of private sector waste management firms. The report was found
satisfactory and disclosed to the InfoShop on December 31, 2002.

48.      In June 2003, the supervision mission noted that additional items from the Waste Management
Plan had been integrated into the first year plan, costs were revised in an effort to ensure uniformity and
standardization, and activities were selected to ensure coordination with those funded under the Global
Fund and by other donors.

49.      Subsequent reports from 2005, 2006, and 2007 show steady progress in the implementation of
the waste management plan, and the QER 2007 commented that "the overall waste management strategy
development process seems to have been comprehensive and includes alternatives assessment of
technology for incineration and stakeholder assessments." The 2007 report cited in particular: (i) the
designation by the project of a well trained professional as the Health Care Waste Officer; (ii) the joint
effort among donors (MAP, WHO, and JSI) in the area of health care waste and injection safety
measures; and (iii) the training of 250 staff from hospitals and clinics around the country as trainers and
the training of 4600 health workers country wide. Problems were noted with respect to incinerator



                                                                                                          11

installation and maintenance, personnel turnover and the need for continued training, and adequate
funding for carrying out the plan.

50.     Procurement, Disbursement, and Financial Management (FM). As noted earlier, the project
did not sub contract the procurement and financial management functions as was the case with other
MAPs. With respect to procurement, no systematic problems were described and, with the exception of
2007, it was assessed as satisfactory. With respect to financial management, despite general satisfaction
expressed during the interim and mid-term reviews and unqualified annual audits, improvements in FM
were suggested in each supervision mission and in the subsequent ISRs; recommendations focused in
particular on: (i) integrating the financial management system with appropriate accounting software; (ii)
updating the manual for financial and accounting procedures; (iii) better accounting capabilities within
line ministries and at provincial levels; (iv) establishing an internal audit function; and (v) improving
and accelerating the preparation of FMRs. Financial management was downgraded from S to MS in
2007 and only upgraded at the last supervision mission (in September 2008) when issues related to
outstanding balances to ministries/districts and to the counterpart financing issue were resolved.

51.     Review of the DGA. The ISRs contain references to the DGA, but there is no evidence that the
legal covenants (and particularly Schedule 4) were systematically reviewed during supervision.

2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

52.     From a technical perspective, the Bank played an important role over the five-year period 2003-
2007 both by supporting preventive services (financed as well by many other partners) and by laying the
foundations for other interventions: (i) building institutional capacities at various levels; (ii) establishing
and supporting operations of coordinating organizations; and (iii) leading the design of the ART
program. The Bank also filled in critical gaps in the national response by financing some activities not
typically funded by others, such as: (i) multi-sectoral activities in the public sector institutions; (ii)
income generating activities for civil society groups; and (iii) school fees for vulnerable children. From
a financial perspective, though, the Bank played a diminishing role during this period, as total
HIV/AIDS financing grew from about US$ 10.0 million in 2003 to roughly US$ 88.0 in 2006.

53.     Given the Bank's key role on certain specific initiatives, "the supplemental grant was the
preferred instrument for the Government to consolidate the gains from the original IDA project while
planning for long-term sustainability through budgetary support and other sources of funding."16
Consequently, preparation of an exit strategy became a preoccupation of the project, and the following
measures were proposed in the Government's plan of February 2008 for the public sector and for care
and treatment:17

     Public sector: Medical services for these Defense and Police were considered sufficiently
        developed with MAP support, but DREW and Global Fund support were anticipated (especially
        human resource issues and supplies for the VCT sites, respectively); and the Public Sector
        Umbrella was integrated into the Ministry for Labor and Civil Service (MIFOTRA);

     District level support (CDLS): Staff recruited under the MAP project were to be transferred to
        the District budgets;

     Care and treatment: As of January 2008, 16 ARV sites previously supported by the MAP 15
        were transferred to PEPFAR and 1 to Catholic Relief Services; in January 2008, 15 were
        transferred to the Global Fund/Round 6. Of the 279 staff paid previously by MAP to directly

         provide HIV/AIDS services, as of January 2008, 224 were transferred to the Civil Service or
         PEPFAR and 52 have been contracted by their health facility.

      Performance-based financing: PEPFAR and the Global Fund/Round 6 will continue financing
         the approach in their respective former MAP sites; the Global Fund / Round 7, which has been
         approved, will expand the approach to the entire country.

54.      With respect to civil society and the support of vulnerable groups, the measures adopted are not
as clear and may not be sufficient. For civil society groups, other funding sources will finance the
community sub-projects but the amounts available are likely to be about 25-33% of what the MAP made
available. For those groups which received funding for income-generating activities, a policy initiative
led by the Ministry of Commerce and Cooperatives proposes to transform the existing associations into
cooperatives and plans to provide training; as indicated by the Government's ICR report, modalities are
still being worked out.

55.      With respect to the management component, the consolidation of the MAP and Global Fund
management units into a single unit under the CNLS ensures that the capacity developed under the MAP
will remain available to the CNLS for the future.

3.       Assessment of Outcomes

3.1      Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

56.      The relevance of the project's objectives and components as well as its specific activities are
rated satisfactory18 from the perspectives of: (i) the Bank's overall policies and country strategy; and (ii)
Rwanda's epidemiological situation and program priorities in the fight against HIV/AIDS.

57.      With respect to the World Bank's country strategies, the Project's Development Objectives
(PDOs) have been and remain aligned with:

             the Second Country Assistance Strategy (2002) which supported the first Poverty Reduction
             Strategy Paper's focus on laying the foundations for growth and sustainable human
             development;

             the Interim Strategy Note (2006) which extended the second CAS during the preparation of
             the second PRSP, the Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS);
             and

             the CAS 2009-2012 (2008) which supports the EDPRS 2008-2012 promoting economic
             transformation and growth and reduced social vulnerability.

58.      In particular, the flexible approach to project implementation places it squarely within the CAS's
support for enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of donor assistance as called for in the EDPRS.

59.      With respect to Rwanda's priorities, the Project's Development Objectives (PDOs) are consistent
with the country's international commitments (to MDG 6 and the Three Ones) and the Government's
policies, including:

             the Flagship Vision 2020 which seeks, among other things, to reduce the vulnerability of
             Rwandan children and mothers to high rates of mortality;




18Though IEG uses a four point scale for rating relevance, efficacy, and efficiency, ICRR guidelines (OPCS, June
2007) do not provide similar explicit ratings scales. For consistency's sake, the ICR team used the six point scale which
is mostly used throughout Annex A of the ICRR guidelines to orient its considerations.


                                                                                                                      13

            the Poverty Reduction Strategy; and

            the National Strategic Plan to Fight HIV/AIDS both for the period 2001-2005 and for the
            revised plan for the period 2006-2010.

60.     Finally, Rwanda has recognized that regional challenges of the epidemic, including migration
patterns might hamper this progress and has complemented national level efforts with participation in
regional HIV/AIDS initiative, notably the Great Lakes countries Initiative against AIDS (GLIA).

61.     It could be argued that the project's objectives are more relevant in 2008 than they were in 2003
because they have consistently focused on addressing HIV/AIDS within the broader contexts of: (i)
poverty reduction and social development; (ii) donor coordination; and (iii) health systems strengthening
(e.g., consolidated procurement, PBF, mutuelles, etc.).

3.2     Achievement of Project Development Objectives

62.     PDO achievement is rated Satisfactory. The project likely contributed to slowing the spread of
HIV/AIDS and helped expand care and support for those infected or affected by HIV. While 17 of 19
output indicators were either satisfactory or highly satisfactory, progress on the project outcome
indicators presented in Annex 10 was more mixed. The shortage of data from near the end of the project
and the absence of data on two indicators makes a judgement difficult. Nonetheless, there was progress
on most PDO indicators with the notable exception of condom use among men 15-49 years old. (This is
likely an issue among older men because condom use among younger men aged 15-24 doubled from
2000 to 2005.)

63.     The PDOs involves two principal outcomes: (i) slowing the spread of HIV/AIDS; (ii) expanding
care and support for those infected and affected by the disaease.

64.     Slowing down the spread of HIV/AIDS. While the PAD explicitly excluded impact measures
from the results chain, HIV prevalence seems to be declining. Data from sentinel surveillance sites
(antenatal care clinics) indicates that prevalence rates have declined between 1998 and 2007 in Kigali,
from 16% to 11.5% and in other urban areas from 9% to 5%. Prevalence rates in sentinel sites in rural
areas have remained stable around 2%. (see figure 2 in Annex 2b) This is consistent with the 2005 DHS
estimates of HIV adult prevalence rate of 2.9% nationally (urban: 7.3%, rural: 2.2%). The apparent
decline in prevalence is likely not due to increased mortality from HIV. A household survey in 2006
found that the probability of death due to HIV in the last year started declining in 2004, around the time
that ARV treatment became widely available (see figure 3 in annex 2b). Thus the decline in HIV
prevalence likely represents a real reduction in incidence (new cases). The likely reduction in HIV
incidence makes sense in a context where, as discussed below (and in Annex 2), knowledge improved,
condom distribution increased, use of voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) was expanded, and access
to ARVs increased.

65.     The results for the four PDO indicators addressing this outcome are presented in the following
table:




                                                                                                        14

        Sources: See Annex 10


66.     Comprehensive knowledge of HIV has increased substantially. As measured by the percentage
of the population correctly identifying two ways in which HIV transmission can be stopped and
rejecting three misconceptions about HIV/AIDS, comprehensive knowledge has more than doubled
during 2000-2005, reaching about 54% for males and 51% for females. This is considerably higher than
other countries in Africa.19 For example, in Uganda, Tanzania, and Nigeria the comparable figures are
34%, 43%, and 25% respectively.

67.     Self-reported behavior change has not improved consistently. Reported condom use by young
people and women improved but seemingly declined for older men. For all young people (15-24 year
olds), reported condom use during sex with casual partners almost doubled. It also nearly doubled for
women 15-49 overall (from about 14.7 to 26%) but declined for males (from 50.3 to 39%).

68.     Median age of first sex has increased slightly. Already high for Africa, the median age of sexual
debut increased further from 20.6 to 20.8 for females and from 20.1 to 20.3 for males. In addition, the
proportion of 15-24 year olds who had not had sex by the age of 18 years rose (from 74% to 81% for
females and from 71 to 74% for males). Finally, while the percentage of female 15-19 year olds who
initiated sex before the age of 15 remained essentially unchanged (from 3 to 3.9%) the percentage rose
for males (from 9 to about 13.2%).

69.     Overall, knowledge combined with modest changes in high-risk sexual behavior and
dramatically increased testing (VCT and PMTCT) may have contributed to declining overall rates of
HIV prevalence since:

     Most young Rwandans are protected from HIV infection. The 2005 DHS noted that the
        percentage of females at risk of HIV (i.e. with multiple partners and no condom use at last sex)
        was estimated at only 1% while the percentage of males at risk for HIV is also low (about 2%).

     Sexually active Rwandans are increasingly seeking testing for HIV. Based on DHS results,
        only 5% of women and 7% of men had ever received an HIV test in 2000, but by 2005, over
        21% of women and about 20% of men had received an HIV test by 2005.

70.     While these results cannot be attributed solely to the MAP, the project did contribute to
increased knowledge and to testing. According to project data, approximately one-third of all persons
tested from 2004-2007 were financed with MAP funds.

71.     Expanding support and care for those infected by TB and HIV/AIDS. As shown in Table 4, the
proportion of confirmed TB patients completing treatment has increased progressively from 75% to
86% surpassing the global target of 85%.

In addition, Rwanda has been a regional leader in scaling up access to care for those co-infected with
tuberculosis. With the adoption of an `opt out' policy, close to 90% of TB patients have been tested for
HIV nationwide, including at the 19 MAP-supported health centers. The percentage of TB patients on
preventive therapy (Cotrimoxazole Presumptive Therapy or CPT to prevent opportunistic infections)
and life saving ART has grown rapidly from 2004 to 2007, from 8% to 61% and from 10% to 39%,
respectively20 (see figure 1 in Annex 2a).

72.     Rwanda is the second best performer in the region (after Namibia) in terms of coverage of ARV
therapy. By the end of 2007, Rwanda had attained a coverage rate of about 70 percent, in comparison to
the average of 30 percent for sub-Saharan African.21 MAP made a substantial contribution to ARV
treatment by establishing the conditions for and funding the decentralization of ARV treatment, as
shown below.

73.     Data suggest that ART is being successful; a retrospective cohort study of a nationally
representative random sample of patients who had initiated ART during 2004 and 2005 (including 6
sites supported by the World Bank project) found an 86% retention rate for adults at 12 months.22 (4.6%

this outcome are presented in the following table.

         Sources: See Annex 10

75.      Ratios of school attendance have improved for orphans. Data for 2006 indicate that the project
provided support for school fees and scholastic materials for about 10% of the 260,000 eligible OVC.24
Even with this support from the government and other sources (including MAP) for OVCs aged 10-14
to attend school, the ratio of school attendance has remained essentially unchanged for both males and
females.

76.      Attitudes about persons living with HIV/AIDS are significantly more accepting. The percentage
of respondents who say express positive attitudes with respect to all of the four measures of acceptance
has increased for both males (from 46% to 51%) and females (from 33% to 46.1%). These results do not
differ substantially by residence (urban-rural) or level of education.25

3.3      Efficiency

77.      Project efficiency was rated as satisfactory based on OED's analysis regarding the principal
elements contributing to the efficiency of the MAPs.26

78.      The Rwanda MAP prioritized and sequenced activities. The project sought to ensure that: (i)
the most cost-effective activities were implemented first and combined with efficiency measures; and
(ii) managerial complexity was reduced in the short run while expanding capacity for the long run. As
examples:

      With respect to the public sector institutions, the project: (i) focused on a few strategic sectors to
         work with rather than every sector; and (ii) after the mid-term review limited support to
         ministries which were demonstrating performance. It also initiated assistance to 3 of the 12
         provincial coordinating committees (CPLS) before expanding to an additional six.

      With respect to care and treatment, the project focused chronologically on: establishing the
         protocols, treatment procedures, and practices for ART in a limited number of sites and
         reinforcing infrastructure and human resources for meeting increased demand before increasing
         the number of facilities and ultimately expanding/decentralizing treatment from hospitals to
         health centers.

24Comparative data are only available for 2006: Project data (Annex 2a) show that 26,993 students received support in
2006; national data (CNLS Annual Report for 2006, p. 37) indicate that a total of 259,934 students received support.

     With respect to the community sub projects: (i) umbrella organizations and supporting agencies
         were used to reach and assist small NGOs and community groups; (ii) management expenses of
         these organizations were capped at 15%; (iii) annual planning established priorities to correct
         any imbalances (in terms of target groups, interventions, geographical areas, etc.) in the
         implementation of the previous year's plan; and (iv) implementation concerns were also
         addressed and the approval methods for sub project were modified to respond to the volume of
         applications.

     With respect to project management, a dedicated project management unit was established for
         the MAP until it became clear that a single unit could manage implementation of the MAP and
         the Global Fund grant, at which time the two units were merged. In addition, progress in
         achieving the "three ones"27 has contributed to improved implementation efficiency through
         joint planning and programming, including (after the mid-term review) the agreement that, with
         the emergence of a range of development partners, MAP funding would focus on interventions
         not typically supported by others.

79.      Two other examples of efficiencies related to care and treatment are worth noting as the project
used approaches for HIV/AIDS which had wider implications for the health system: (i) investment in a
laboratory network with capabilities of dealing with a range of other pathologies; and (ii) coordinated
funding of ARV drugs through the use of country procurement systems to promote the use of
standardized drug regimens, enhance planning and forecasting skills, and achieve economies of scale
and cost savings.28

80.      The Rwanda MAP sought to establish monitoring, evaluation, and research among the
highest priorities for the country. The project accompanied the "learning by doing" philosophy with
serious monitoring and evaluation of piloted activities to ensure their efficiency and efficacy prior to
scale-up. In addition to the previous discussion of M&E and to the ART example above, two examples
are worth noting:

     With respect to care and treatment, performance-based financing was tested in two provinces
         (Cyangugu and Butare) and evaluated after six months before being adopted as national policy
         and funded by MAP, Global Fund and other sources.

     With respect to community sub projects, assistance to 18 associations of prostitutes (and more
         than 1100 ex prostitutes) to encourage different income generating activities was evaluated prior
         to scaling up the approach.

3.4      Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

81.      Based on satisfactory ratings for relevance, achievement and efficiency, the overall outcome
rating is satisfactory.




27And in 2006 to the three ones for the Big Three, meaning that the Government will coordinate the activities for fight
against HIV and AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, with TRAC being transformed into TRAC plus to handle all three.
28Collaboration between the Bank and CDC has also contributed to the adoption of the TRAC Net System, a mobile
phone based system that produces critical patient information for HIV treatment and timely program information on the
availability of ARV drugs to preempt stocks outs. This system has assisted in the scale up of HIV clinical services and
improved the efficiency of program management.

3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

82.     Poverty impacts and social development. Rather than singling out the poor and the vulnerable
for vertical interventions, Rwanda's poverty strategy has emphasized their integration into communities,
associations, cooperatives, etc. This approach, adopted by the project, was seen by those interviewed
during this ICR as an important reason for the reduction in the stigma and discrimination associated with
HIV/AIDS. For example, while the income-generating activities may have had a mixed record from an
economic viewpoint, their contribution to the development (confidence, self-empowerment, etc.) of the
associations of PLWHA is considered a significant contribution of the project.

83.     Gender aspects. A number of important assessments of gender issues were carried out between
2002 and 200529 and addressed gender issues both within the structure of the MAPs and specifically in
the Rwanda context. In January 2004, a gender specialist sought to mobilize government interest to
participate in a Bank-sponsored capacity building initiative for including gender, but a subsequent
mission indicated little progress. The 2005 study was perhaps the most critical, identifying, for example,
continuing weaknesses in girls' sexual education, difficulties in "negotiating safe sex", and in attitudes
(of communities in general and health staff in particular) related to the special needs of girls and women.
In 2007, however, the QER found, "compelling evidence based on case studies, testimonials, beneficiary
assessments and focus group discussions of the positive gender impact, particularly as the majority of
beneficiaries are female."

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

84.     The project contributed in three important ways to the development of the country's institutions
and capacities:

     First, though a multi sectoral approach was a fundamental element of the Government's strategy,
        reasonably good relations between the CNLS and the MOH (contrary to other MAP countries)
        contributed to effective implementation, with CNLS facilitating and coordinating HIV/AIDS
        interventions without getting involved in implementing the health sector HIV/AIDS response.

     Second, the Government expressed early and persistently its interest in subsuming MAP
        management under a larger program management unit within the CNLS; when this was
        eventually done, the benefits for both the project and the country were evident.

     Third, the health sector and the fight against HIV/AIDS were seen within the context of overall
        government initiatives to reduce poverty and to decentralize decision-making to the district level.
        The organization of the project within this context and MAP's support for district staff to
        coordinate these efforts strengthened the newly formed districts.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.6     Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

85.     A summary of the results of the beneficiary survey (2006) is presented in Annex 5. The 2007
QER noted the following results from the MAP beneficiaries report: (i) a stable source of income and
greater access to micro credit; (ii) payment of school fees for their children; (iii) expanded access to
health insurance; (iv) greater access to HIV testing and treatment; (v) reduction in stigma and

                                                                                                                 19

discrimination; and (vi) improvements in self esteem, as they have become productive members of
society. The QER further noted the mid-term review's findings that the project had enhanced the
capacity to plan, implement, and monitor projects at all levels and that local groups have demonstrated a
strong ability to manage funds effectively and transparently.

4.       Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

86.      Significant advances since 2003 and the prospects for sustaining these for the foreseeable future
(at least through 2012) have reduced considerably the risk to development outcome. Government
commitment to fighting HIV/AIDS remains unwavering at the highest levels, and the institutional and
strategic measures have been logical and effective. In particular: (i) institutional arrangements (and
particularly decentralization) have strengthened capacities in the districts for all programs, including
HIV/AIDS; (ii) the growing evidence base was used to adapt the National Strategy 2005-09 (and the
next strategy which is already being formulated) and to promote appropriate program policies and
procedures (for testing, care and support, and treatment); and (iii) significant financing has been
mobilized (from public, private, and other equally committed partners) and adequate absorptive capacity
demonstrated (increasingly using harmonized modalities among the different sources).

87.      For the program as a whole, the political, institutional, technical, and financial elements
certainly seem solid;30 for other elements of the MAP project previously noted (particularly the public
sector and civil society sub projects aimed at prevention and mitigation), it is quite probable that the
measures agreed on in the exit strategy, will have a detrimental effect on the operation's development
outcome. Whether the expected decline in financing of these sub projects has an effect on the overall
program should be monitored.

5.       Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1      Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

88.      While noting the "protracted disagreements between the country and the Bank team," the QER
of December 2002 characterized the project as "generally well prepared" and commended the team for:
(i) pursuing a participatory approach; (ii) undertaking several innovative pieces of preparatory analytical
work; and (iii) opportunistically using contributions from other donors. The QER also noted the team's
candor in pointing out the remaining gray areas and potential implementation difficulties. Similarly, as
noted previously, the Quality at Entry assessment of June 2007 categorized the project as satisfactory
overall and noted a number of strong aspects, including strong borrower commitment, successful use of
a demand-driven approach, and excellent donor coordination.31

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory




30Political events in the sub-region must always be noted in this region of Africa.
31The assessment also noted the task team's knowledge of the project and the speed (two months) with which the
supplemental grant was prepared. For reasons which are not entirely clear to the reviewer, the QEA was especially
harsh on the environmental aspects of the project.


                                                                                                                 20

89.      Based on the Decision Meeting's concern for close supervision and agreement to finance more
intensive supervision, the Task Team summarized its approach in a supplementary annex to the PAD.
The approach was further detailed in an ISR (#3) which proposed to: (i) track non objections and
provide rapid turnaround; (ii) monitor progress on the PIP with monthly status reports prepared by the
country office; (iii) participate in CCM meetings to ensure coordination; and (iv) carry out 3-4
supervision missions during the first year. These measures were essentially continued throughout
project implementation.32 In addition, a reverse supervision was organized in January 2005 to: (i)
disseminate best practices from the Rwanda MAP and (ii) to learn from other HIV/AIDS operations
(MAP and non-MAP), focusing in particular on impact evaluation.

90.      Among the strengths of the Task Team's supervision were: (i) the continuity of the Team (with a
single TTL leading the team for virtually the entire project); (ii) its extensive support (with assistance
from GAMET) for strengthening monitoring and evaluation; (iii) its persistence in pushing for an exit
strategy; (iv) the opportunities financed for the country to present its project and program at different
regional and international venues; and (v) its promotion of research (with assistance from DECRG),
particularly the impact evaluation that was carried out on the effectiveness of results-based financing. In
addition, the TT had an excellent record of responding to requests for non objections: two-thirds of all
requests were handled within 7 days and less than 10% required more than two weeks.

91.      One weakness of the supervision may be found in the ISRs, which tended to be repetitive and
lacking in: (i) information concerning the indicators (this may be linked to the format of the ISR); and
(ii) lack of clear follow up on previously recommended actions (although there were some exceptions,
for instance in procurement; see the AM of December 2005). It is not always clear from a reading of the
AMs and ISRs whether and when identified problems were resolved, particularly with respect to
financial management.33

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

92.      The satisfactory design of the project and careful oversight of the project's progress, combined
with the Task Team's attentiveness to the Government's concerns and its flexibility in responding to
them within the framework of the project justify the overall rating of Satisfactory.

5.2      Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

93.      With the exception of the moderately satisfactory ratings for counterpart financing, public sector
support, and (on a single occasion) financial management, the ISRs consistently rated Government's
performance as satisfactory. The elements of Government's solid performance have been cited
previously and can be summarized as follows: (i) political commitment; (ii) positive relationships with
beneficiaries, stakeholders, and partners; (iii) progress in establishing the Three Ones (comprehensive
strategy, single coordinating body, and common M&E framework); (iv) improved implementation
capabilities at district level; and (v) proactive efforts to harmonize and coordinate HIV/AIDS funding


32The Government's ICR found that 66% of all NO requests were responded to in less than 7 days and 87% in less than
15 days; only 2 (of 95) took more than 30 days. Rapport d'achèvement préliminaire (Octobre 2008), p. 67.
33Curiously, FM was satisfactory over the first three years or so and only moderately satisfactory over the last eighteen
months. The TTL suggests several potential explanations: (i) the departure after three years of the experienced FM
specialist; (ii) the change in the Bank's FMS; (iii) the merger of the GF and MAP units; and (iv) the decentralization to
30 new administrative districts which did not always provide the necessary financial reporting information.


                                                                                                                        21

through joint planning and programming of activities, consolidated management of the various donor-
funded operations (especially IDA and the Global Fund), and common procurement of ARV drugs and
other commodities.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

94.     With the exception of a single ISR, the performance of the PMU was judged satisfactory by the Task
Team. This assessment is justified by: (i) the continual achievement (and often overachievement) of the
project's planned outputs; (ii) the timely accomplishment of the major project milestones (the interim review,
the mid-term review, and the Borrower's ICR); (iii) the ability to adapt project implementation to changed
circumstances (whether to increase disbursement in 2005 or to safeguard project priorities while waiting for
the signature of the supplemental in 2007); and (iv) the regular availability of project reports (FMRs, annual
reports, etc.) and the ability to produce specific analyses of project data.

95.     A number of management efforts are worth noting: (i) the merger of the MAP and Global Fund
implementation units within the framework of the CNLS; (ii) the decentralization of supervision and
especially the inclusion of the local mayors in the supervision process; and (iii) the efforts in progress to
integrate the various activities and sources of funding into an overall annual plan available on-line.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

96.     The satisfactory performance of the Government and of the Implementing Agency justifies the
overall rating of Satisfactory.

6.      Lessons Learned

97.     While confirming the lessons learned from the first generation of MAP assistance,34 the Rwanda
MAP also generated some refinements to those lessons learned.

98.     Commitment can be confirmed in many ways. Given the demonstrated importance of
commitment for combating HIV/AIDS, the MAP offers an example of why commitment should be
viewed more broadly than in the somewhat narrow terms of high-level political support and specific
financial contributions (and especially project counterpart funds). Many factors which contributed to
the project's success were not specifically directed at the epidemic but provided a favorable institutional
and programmatic context for project implementation: (i) its attitude toward governance and corruption;
and (ii) its policies for decentralization, promotion of cooperatives and mutuelles, integration of health
services, etc.

99.     One of the most important elements of Rwanda's commitment was its poverty strategy, which
emphasized inclusion of the poor and the vulnerable within communities, associations, cooperatives, etc.
With respect to HIV/AIDS, the strategy's focus on vulnerable populations rather than individuals is
viewed as one of the main reasons for the decline in the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS. With
respect to the support for income-generating activities, the emphasis on associations of PLWHA has not
guaranteed success, but has contributed to many of the successes. Conversely, where efforts
concentrated on individuals (payment of school fees for selected students), many of the problems seen in
other MAPs have occurred (e.g., disputed selection criteria, political intervention at the local level, etc.).

                                                                                                             22

100.     The Bank's comparative advantages need to be recognized and exploited. While the Bank is
often criticized for its slow and complex procedures, the MAP demonstrated several of its comparative
advantages, particularly its flexibility and willingness to support Government strategies. In particular,
interviewees cited the Bank's early willingness: (i) to address treatment and care holistically through
measures to strengthen health systems and health personnel; (ii) to support the Government's policy of
decentralizing services and program coordination; (iii) to promote Government initiatives to consolidate
procurement, test and scale up performance-based financing, and improve health care financing through
mutuelles. In a number of these instances, interviewees noted that the Bank's non-financial support was
at least as essential as its financial support for persuading other partners.

101.     More broadly, the evidence points to a number of areas where the Bank actively sought to help
the project succeed, from the mundane (responding rapidly to demands for non objections) to the
important: clarifying agreements (including the DGA), encouraging partnerships (with CDC, DEC, etc.),
sharing success stories both within the country and abroad, etc. The Bank's fiduciary responsibilities
and its often adversarial role need to be balanced as well by advocacy where the case is warranted.

102.     Evidenced-based decision-making requires more than measures and tools. A major focus of the
project was to strengthen the evidence base for project management in general and to provide a basis for
scaling up successful interventions in particular. Unlike the experience with other MAPs, the Rwanda
MAP included a long and concerted effort (with project and Bank funding) to strengthen M&E and
related systems (including TRAC), identify and document best practices, and carry out impact
evaluations. However, despite even these best efforts to produce an evidence base, the use of the
information for program management often may have less to do with the quality of the information and
more to do with its timely availability. The lack of any data from the 2008 mini-DHS to evaluate this
project indicates the difficulty of coordinating survey data collection when financing comes from other
sources.

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies: See Annex 7

(b) Co-financing: Even though there was no formal co-financing, the US Center for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) financed laboratory equipment for the MAP ART sites, the roll out of the
TRACNet system at these sites, and a contract for CARE International to provide home-based care to
patients living with HIV/AIDS.

Annex 2a: Outputs by Component

         The projects outputs are discussed by component below and summarized by component and by
year in the table 21 at the end of this annex.

Component 1: Public Sector Support

         With adoption of a multi sectoral approach and establishment of new institutions (at central and
decentralized levels), non-health public sector entities expanded their responsibilities in combating
HIV/AIDS. MAP supported: (i) mainstreaming of HIV/AIDS activities into line ministries and other
public sector institutions at both central and decentralized levels; (ii) expanded services (condom
distribution, VCT, etc.) by numerous public sector structures, including ministries and national agencies,
institutions of higher education, etc.; and (iii) changes in both individual and institutional behavior.

         Mainstreaming of HIV/AIDS: MAP support for line ministries focused on HIV prevention (e.g.
work place policies and programs, anti AIDS clubs in schools, VCT promotion), though the uniformed
services (the army and police) received funding for enhancing service provision at their health facilities,
which served not only their constituents but the general population. Ultimately, fifteen ministries and
other national agencies received funding, but the three principal recipients of project funding were the
uniformed services (42%) and the ministries of social affairs and gender (34%) and education (15%).

         The MAP also supported capacity building and operations (including some salaries) of the
national and three provincial committees (CNLS and CPLS). With the reorganization of the national
administrative system in 2006, support for the three provincial committees was replaced by support for
thirty district committees. In this context, the project contributed to the formulation of strategic
documents, the organization of general information campaigns, etc.

         Establishing services, particularly condom distribution: Overall, the project distributed about
17.5 million condoms, of which some 71% were distributed through the public sector institutions:

         Condom distribution in the public sector was essentially limited to the uniformed services; the
project also rehabilitated 4 VCT for the police and 7 VCT for the military.

         Contributions to individual and institutional behavior: The project's outputs with respect to
organizing training sessions for public sector employees (in planning, management and monitoring-
evaluation of work plans) and to IEC/BCC events are presented below.

        In addition, the success of the Information and Documentation Center (CRIS), established by the
CNLS in 2004, merits mentioning. During the past six months, more than 4,000 persons (more than
75% students and other young people) have used its information services; the Hotline telephone service
to more than 20,000 telephone calls, organized conferences and workshops, prepared documents, etc.

Component 2: Health Sector HIV/AIDS Care and Treatment Component

        In 2002, ART was essentially limited to 4 national referral hospitals; only 22 physicians were
authorized to prescribe treatment; and some 900 PLWHA were receiving treatment. The MAP was the
first project to support the expansion of ART to local levels by: (i) financing development of treatment
procedures and protocols (with CDC and TRAC); and (ii) strengthening the delivery of HIV/AIDS
services (health infrastructure, human resources, etc.) to meet the increased demand and workload (from
VCT and PMTCT interventions, laboratory and blood bank interventions and surveillance). In addition,
the project took other measures during implementation to protect (through medical waste management)
and to motivate (through performance-based financing) health care providers.

        Development of treatment procedures and protocols: Through the MAP-financed CDC/TRAC
TRAC, a number of elements were developed to introduce a provincial model of care, including: (i) site
assessment tools and guidelines for site certification; (ii) design of the national ARV clinical encounter
and follow up form; and (iii) revision of the training curriculum.35

        Strengthening the delivery of ARV and other health services: As shown below, MAP's support
for service delivery increased rapidly from 2004-07 (at district hospital and health center levels) prior to
implementation of the exit plan in 2008. Based on the results of the initial 13 sites (2005-06), project
objectives were increased and 18 sites added to facilitate access of the population to treatment. The
project also established a network of laboratory capabilities (CD4, hematology, biochemistry), which
served patients undergoing ARV treatment as well as patients being treated for other types of illnesses.

         Through a flexible funding mechanism, participating ART sites received annual grants (of up to
US$ 60,000) to enhance service quality (including facility upgrading, laboratory services, and human
resources), strengthen adherence, and meet other needs of the ARV program. MAP also contributed to
the recruitment of health personnel to provide HIV/AIDS services in the hospitals (200 staff) and health
centers (79 staff) and to the training of personnel. It is important to note that this additional personnel
represented between 15 and 25% of the total staff of these facilities, and that the health facilities were
empowered to decide who to hire, how much to pay them, and how to use them. As of January 2008,
276 of the 279 staff recruited and paid by MAP had been transferred to the Civil Service or PEPFAR or
contracted by the health facility. The number of health personnel trained by the project is shown below:

         In addition, a number of related outputs merit mentioning, including: (i) the Coordinated
Procurement and Distribution System (CPDS); and (ii) the Performance-Based Financing (PBF) system.
The CPDS, established at the end of 2004, has enabled: (i) the Ministry to organize more efficiently the
procurement of drugs (ARV, IO et IST), reagents, and HIV tests, previously done unilaterally by each
partner exclusively for its own sites; and (ii) CAMERWA to have a greater latitude in negotiating the
prices of products with the suppliers. Overall, from January 2005 to December 2007, the MAP financed
12% of the costs of ARVs procured by CAMERWA. These steps and the collaboration of the Clinton
Foundation have enabled the Government to negotiate significantly lower prices for ARVs and
associated diagnostic materials and to increase significantly the number of patients who were treated
with the existing budget.

         The Bank-led introduction of performance based financing (PBF) for HIV/AIDS related services
(subsequently adopted as national policy and supported through several PRSC/Gs, by PEPFAR, and by
others) has contributed to the scale up of services by setting service targets for each facility, encouraging
staff at each facility to find ways to increase service coverage, and allowing staff to earn bonus
payments by meeting and exceeding the targets.
         MAP's contribution to progress in testing and treatment is presented in the table 11 below:36

       Finally, the project's contribution to testing tuberculosis patients for HIV in the three project
areas has also been important:

       With adoption of an `opt out' policy, close to 90% of TB patients have been tested for HIV
nationwide, including at the 19 MAP-supported health centers. The percentage of TB patients on
cotrimoxazole presumptive therapy (CPT) against opportunistic infections and life saving ART has
grown rapidly from 2004 to 2007, as can be seen in Figure 1:37

3: Civil Society Support Component

       While there had been limited, small scale efforts to work with the private sector and civil society,
the MAP provided the first real possibility to scale up the participation of these important segments of
the society. Support for these community-driven local initiatives was expected to: (i) emphasize
preventive measures to facilitate behavior change (through HIV testing of group members, IEC, etc);
and (ii) finance sub projects with the objectives of:

     delivering psycho-social support, home-based care, and other assistance for infected groups; and

     providing social and financial support for poor and vulnerable groups (infected and affected),
        including payment of annual health insurance/mutuelle fees, financing of school fees, funding
        for income-generation activities, etc.

Two channels were used to finance these activities: (i) established NGOs, which had prepared and
approved proposals and were launched first to carry out a specific set of activities; and (ii) screened and
approved umbrella organizations, which worked with smaller associations to plan and implement their
sub-projects and received the bulk of the MAP funding for civil society groups

        Contributions to behavior change: The project's outputs with respect to organizing IEC/BCC
events are presented below:

        As can be seen from the table, once the project determined that these events were not producing
the desired results, they were halted.

        The distribution of MAP sub project financing reflects: (i) the MAP's targeting of the former
districts of Butare (now South Province), Cyangugu (West Province) and Umutara (East Province) for
the ARV and OVC activities; and (ii) Kigali's access to information and proximity to project
management.

        The trend in the sub projects seems quite clear: initial financing of the range of potential sub
projects, followed by a more focused emphasis on home-based care and mitigation (with extreme
priority setting in 2007 due to the delay in the supplemental), finishing with increased support for home-
based care and revenue-generating activities to ease the transition. Overall, the mitigation sub-projects
comprised 79% of all sub projects financed and accounted for 84% of all sub project funds disbursed.
Income generating activities comprised 64% of sub projects and 50% of disbursements.

        Sub projects were concentrated on specific beneficiary groups, with OVC/Youth and
Associations of Persons Infected (PI) or Affected (PA) accounting for 90% of sub projects and
disbursements. While the inclusiveness of the associations and the overlapping nature of some of the
target populations make actual counts of the beneficiary populations difficult, table 18 estimates the
number of persons helped by the MAP-funded subprojects.

        The results for 2007 and 2008 are often similar because they reflect the continuation of funding
for 2008 of sub projects initiated in 2007.

        Household and individual level outputs: In addition to funding sub projects, MAP financed
households and individuals; the resulting project outputs are presented in table 19:

         The early flexibility of MAP's financing mechanism enabled the project to subsidize health
insurance for about 56,000 households or nearly a quarter of a million vulnerable individuals. This
facilitated access to general health services for these vulnerable groups and supported the scale up of the
government's broader health reform aimed at expanding nationwide access to community health
insurance (mutuelles).

4: Program Management, Monitoring and Evaluation

         Project funds are intended to provide financial and technical support for: (i) the operations of the
National HIV/AIDS Commission (CNLS) to coordinate the national program and of the provincial
(CPLS) and district-level entities (CDLS) to strengthen local coordination, carry out advocacy, and
facilitate social mobilization; (ii) improving overall monitoring and evaluation of the program; and (iii)
establishing the Project Management Unit to facilitate the programming, coordination, and monitoring
of project activities.

         Coordination: In addition to funding the operational costs of the principal national HIV/AIDS
structures, MAP contributed to capacity building and coordination by funding training sessions and
regular meetings. The results are presented in table 20:

                              Table 20: Coordinating structures: Capacity-building events

         Monitoring and evaluation: In addition to the outputs mentioned in the text, this sub component
made progressive strides to:
     develop the requisite data base tools and organize training in specific applications (Excel, MS
         Access) and data management ;
     decentralize the monitoring and evaluation system to the Provincial level (9 of 12 CPLS from
         October 2003 to December 2005) and then to the District level (30 CDLS from January 2006 to
         June 2008;
     recruit adequate personnel: of the 47 persons recruited to assist civil society organizations and
         the CDLS, two-thirds were recruited for monitoring and evaluation;
     finance supervision visits of the sub projects by the umbrella organizations: over the project
         period, approximately 5,000 visits were carried out; and
     participate in a series of semester and annual reviews to present results, share experiences, and
         find solutions to common problems.

         Finally, the Bank co-financed the 2005 Demographic and Health Survey which generated more
reliable information on the epidemic, a beneficiary assessment to measure client satisfaction, and an
important impact evaluation of the performance based financing scheme and of the socio-economic and
behavioral impact of scaling up ARV treatment.

Annex 2b: Impact38

Determining the status of the HIV epidemic

         The concerted efforts to mount a truly multi-sectoral HIV response over the past 5 years
appear to have produced positive results in containing the epidemic. Data from sentinel
surveillance sites (i.e. antenatal care clinics) provide reasonable estimates of trends in HIV prevalence
rates, particularly as the number of sites and their geographical representation have improved rapidly.

         The 2005 DHS estimated the HIV adult prevalence rate at 2.9% with urban areas at 7.3% and
rural areas at 2.2%. These figures are consistent with sentinel surveillance data. As can be seen from the
figure 2, there has been a gradual downward trend in HIV infection rates during the period 1998-2007,
particularly in urban areas.

        In addition to adults, the percentage of infants born HIV positive from HIV positive pregnant
women was reduced, as a result of the scale-up of PMTCT services, from 23% in 2003 to 11% in
2007.39

The rapid and sustained expansion in life saving anti-retroviral therapy has likely resulted in a
drop in HIV/AIDS related mortality. A survey of the households of 1,500 AIDS patients and 500
non-patient (control) households was carried out in 2006 and was used to retrospectively estimate the
annual probability of dying from HIV-related causes. Three different approaches were used to estimate
this probability. The solid line in Figure 3 ("patients' household) assumed that all adult deaths in a
patient's household were HIV related. The dotted line ("HIV+ deaths personal") represents information
from all 2000 households about whether there was a death in the household during the last 5 years in
which household members believed was HIV related. The dashed line ("HIV+ deaths professional")
represents mortality estimates in which household members had been told by a health professional that a
death in the family was HIV related or had a death certificate with an HIV related cause of death. All
these approaches suggest that HIV/AIDS related mortality increased (or was effected by inadequate
recall) until 2003 and then declined progressively with the scale up of the ART program. This data when
combined with the decline in HIV prevalence rates likely represents a real decline in the incidence
(number of new cases) of HIV in Rwanda during the life of the project.

(measuring decreasing deaths due to AIDS and AIDS-related diseases); and (iii) mitigating the effects of
the disease on those infected or affected (measuring an improved quality of life and an increased ability
to cope socio-economically with the effects of HIV/AIDS).

Slowing the spread of HIV/AIDS

        There has been a substantial increase in comprehensive knowledge of HIV. As measured
by the percentage of the population reporting having comprehensive HIV knowledge (i.e. correctly
identifying 2 ways in which HIV transmission can be stopped and rejecting 3 misconceptions about
HIV/AIDS), knowledge more than doubled during 2000-2005, reaching about 54% for females and
close to 57% for males. This is one of the highest rates for Africa. Moreover, results from the
HIV/AIDS 2006 household survey funded under the project found generally comparable knowledge
levels among patients and non-patients, confirming that communications messages have reached the
general population.

        Most young Rwandans are protected from HIV infection. Based on results on the ABCs of
safe sex practices for 15-24 year olds during 2000-2005, the 2005 DHS noted that:

     the percentage of females at risk of HIV (i.e. with multiple partners and no condom use at last
         sex) was estimated at only 1%, since (i) over 65% of females never had sex, (ii) about 5% had
         no partners in the last year, (iii) about 2% had one partner and used a condom during last sex,
         and (iv) most of the remaining female population had multiple partners but used a condom; and

     the percentage of males at risk for HIV is also low (about 2%) but with larger numbers
         initiating sex earlier and greater levels of sexual activity.

        Sexually active Rwandans are increasingly seeking testing for HIV. As access to voluntary
counseling and testing has increased (with 300+ sites nationwide), the number of Rwandans using VCT
has increased, thereby improving knowledge of HIV status. This result is confirmed by the DHS results:
in 2000, only 5% of women and 7% of men had ever received an HIV test; by 2005, over 21% of
women and about 20% of men had received an HIV test by 2005.          40


        In addition, a Behavioral Surveillance Survey conducted in 2006 found that over 65% of sex
workers (who were one of the main beneficiary groups of the project) had been tested in 2006 in
comparison to only 36% in 2000.41

        Finally, both the number of pregnant women seeking HIV testing and the proportion HIV+
pregnant women provided with ARVs to reduce the risk of transmission from mother to child have
increased; the average number of women seeking testing has been about 100,000 per year, the
proportion provided with ARVs has increased from 14% in 2003 to 28% in 2005 and 65% in 2007.42 As
a result of the scale-up of PMTCT services, the percentage of infants born HIV positive from HIV
positive pregnant women was reduced from 23% in 2003 to 11% in 2007.43 (Rwanda UNGASS report
2008).

        HIV+ patients had lower levels of reported sexual activity and dramatically higher levels of
condom use than non-patients. The baseline survey found 40% of patients reported having sex within
the past 12 months (compared with 56% of non patients), while 77% of patients reported using a
condom during their last encounter (compared with 37% of non patients). If these patterns of sexual

behavior are confirmed by the follow up 2008 survey this may provide evidence of the benefits of
antiretroviral therapy (i.e. those on ART are more likely to adopt safer sexual behavior).

Improving the quantity and quality of services for the diagnosis and treatment

         As part of its national policy, Government explicitly linked expenditures for HIV/AIDS services
to improvements in basic health services, thereby using funding for a single disease to contribute to the
broader development of health care. As a result, the project contributed to two kinds of interrelated
impacts: (i) the impact of HIV/AIDS financing on health services; and (ii) the impact of health services
on HIV/AIDS service delivery and mortality.

         HIV/AIDS funding has increased the supply of and demand for health services in general.
An analysis of HIV/AIDS and other health-related projects implemented from 2000 to 2006 found that
the HIV/AIDS project funding has contributed to better health services in general through:

     improved infrastructure, including rehabilitation (though not construction) of health facilities,
         waste management (incinerators), and electricity, water and sanitation;44

     increased human resources, as 22% of personnel working in the health facilities were recruited
         during this period, of which almost 80% of these health workers were either nurses or lab
         technicians; and

     additional services, including laboratory services as well as the introduction of certain curative
         and preventive services. 45

         A later laboratory evaluation found that those districts doing the most voluntary testing were
those where laboratory services supported prevention programs (VCT, PMTCT) rather than those where
the VCT and PMTCT sites were separate from the laboratory capabilities.46

         Another study, organized as a baseline survey for an impact evaluation of performance-based
contracting for HIV/AIDS services, was conducted in December 2005 and the report issued in 2007.47
The study focused on health facilities with respect to physical, financial, and human resources; it also
examined the delivery of basic health services and laboratory tests.48 Data about the accessibility of the
health services, wait times, service quality, and patient satisfaction were also collected. Baseline and
follow-up comparisons in PBF and non PBF areas (in the MAP project area) are presented below:

         Though patient satisfaction for PMTCT services declined slightly for all criteria in both PBF and
non-PBF facilities, overall satisfaction levels remained quite high for both types of facilities.49

         In terms of quality, the baseline survey found high levels of provider knowledge (i.e. over 74%
of staff was trained) at MAP sites; provider vignettes (which assessed knowledge levels and quality of
care) found that 84% of providers at MAP sites would ask about the partner's status and over 100%
would recommend partner to be tested. Exit interviews also found that provider effort during
examinations was generally satisfactory with a few notable lapses (e.g. discussion of social support,
nutritional guidelines, and traditional healers). Exit interviews found that the majority of clients were
satisfied or very satisfied with these services with very low levels of dissatisfaction (less than 6%).

         In addition to improving service availability, HIV/AIDS financing has contributed to improving
the quality of service delivery, in particular through the performance based contracting. An early
evaluation of the approach supported by IDA concluded that the contractual approach provinces (ex
Cyangugu, Butare) outperformed the control provinces (Kibungo, Umutara) on all indicators in absolute
achievement, in the proportional increase per indicator since the introduction of the output based
schemes as well as in quality."50 In particular, the PBF provinces demonstrated increased rates in HIV
testing (before/after comparison) in contrast to non PBF provinces. Key informants note as well that the
PBF approach stimulated important innovations in service delivery (e.g. outreach activities to stimulate
HIV testing, promotion of couple testing). The bonus payments have led to a discernible improvement
in incomes for participating personnel (e.g. increases of up to 25% in incomes) and additional revenues
for the facilities as part of the proceeds were re-invested in participating sites. Current Government
policy conditions future payments for HIV/AIDS services to improvements in the quality of basic health
services, showing how funding for a single disease can focus attention on the broader quality of care.

         Financial access to and demand for health services have increased with the development of
community-based health insurance schemes through the mutuelle movement. The number of organized
mutuelles has increased rapidly, from 88 in 2003 to 403 in 2007 and membership in communities served
by them has increased from 7% to 75%.51 This increase has been significantly fueled by donors, who
have financed about 45% of the annual insurance premiums. The MAP alone subsidized access to
health insurance for about 56,000 households or nearly a quarter of a million vulnerable individuals.52

both an administrative and a financial perspective.53

        Utilization of HIV/AIDS-related health services has rapidly increased as a result of the
improved quality of health care and the population's renewed confidence in it. As was shown in
the outputs section, the expansion and utilization of HIV/AIDS-related services over the project period
has been dramatic:

        The resulting expansion in the availability and the utilization of services has impacted the
number of persons placed on ARV.

        Rwanda has nearly attaining universal adult coverage for ART. When the preparation of
the IDA Project was launched in 2002 Rwanda had only 870 patients on ART with virtually all services
concentrated at 4 urban sites and care provided only to those able to pay. Today, ART is provided at
over 165 sites nationwide (of which 31 sites were funded by the Bank) with close to 56,000 patients. By
the end of 2007, Rwanda had attained a coverage rate (number of patients on ARV expressed as a
percentage of those that are estimated to need ARVs) of about 70 percent (in comparison with the sub-
Saharan African average of 30%), making the country the second best performer in the region in terms
of coverage of antiretroviral therapy54. For children (0-14), out of a total need for ART of 6,489 more
than 4,000 received treatment (62%) through September 2007. While this data should be treated
cautiously, the data from Rwanda shows a dramatic scale-up of services.

         Management of PLWHA has improved measurably. As shown below, Rwanda's
performance has been appropriate:
     The average CD4 and WHO stage on enrollment are comparable to those in other countries:
         According to a TRAC Report, in 2006 nearly half of all adults and children on treatment were at
         an advanced stage of the disease (i.e. WHO clinical stage 3). The median baseline CD4 cell
         count for the Rwanda cohort was 141 (of which 148 for females and 129 for males). This
         situation is similar to that in other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, where most treatment
         programs are finding patients only when in advanced disease and placing them on treatment
         when CD 4 counts range between 100 and 150.55
     Retention rates are high: A retrospective cohort analysis of a nationally representative random
         sample of patients who had initiated ART during 2004-2005 (including 6 sites supported by the
         World Bank project) found a high proportion of adults and children remained alive and in
         treatment at their original clinic at 12 months (86 and 89 percent, respectively).56 For
         comparison, a 2007 review of patient retention in ART programs in sub-Saharan Africa found an
         average retention rate of only 75 percent after one year.57

     The rate of switch to second line ART is relatively low: The number of Rwandans on costly
         second line ART was less than 400 at the end of 2006 which represents only 1 percent of all
         patients on treatment. While data from other countries are limited, experience to date shows low
         levels (less than 5 percent) of second line drug use in many cases. For example, a recent
         collaborative analysis of 22 000 patients presented in Montreal calculated 2.4 percent (cases per
         100 patient years).58

         The results appear robust irrespective of the measures used and are consistent with data from the
TRAC study on clinical and immunologic outcomes which found that 3.6 percent died by six months
and 4.6 percent by 12 months. By contrast, the average mortality rate on ART in Africa was estimated
at 7.5 percent in 2005. A more recent review of African studies reported substantially higher ranges (i.e.
between 8 and 26 percent) in the first year.

        Although pediatric AIDS care was introduced gradually and lags behind adult ARV access,
coverage continues to expand. In January 2005, 35 children 0-15 years old were on ARV treatment
and by November 2005 coverage rose to 222 children. Since July 2006 measures have been put in place
to scale up pediatric care. Currently, some 4,500 children 0-15 years old are on ARV treatment, of
which roughly 900 at the MAP-supported sites. However, there is still concern over additional barriers
to access for pediatric ARV aside from the cost and complexity of scaling up treatment from the supply
side. Based on household-level mortality analysis from the baseline impact evaluation, data suggest that
for children 0-4 years old from 2000-2005, even in households including an adult HIV/AIDS patient,
very few child deaths were reported by the female head to be related to HIV/AIDS and even fewer were
diagnosed as such by a health care professional. This might indicate that when a child's health is
deteriorating, HIV/AIDS was not often considered as a potential cause and appropriate care was not
sought. Additional research is necessary in order to identify what supply or demand side barriers may
persist as the country strives for universal coverage for pediatric ARV treatment.

         Mitigating the effects of the disease on those infected or affected

         Rather than focusing on specific categories of the poor and vulnerable (e.g., persons infected or
affected by HIV/AIDS), Rwanda's poverty reduction strategy has emphasized their inclusion within
broader communities, associations, etc. This focus on groups rather than individuals is seen as: (i) an
important contributing factor for the decline in the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS; and (ii) a means
for organizing these persons into potentially economically viable groups.

         Rwandans have adopted more accepting attitudes towards HIV positive persons.
Accepting attitudes about persons living with HIV/AIDS have changed with those indicating their
willingness to care for a sick family member or to allow a female teacher who is HIV+ but who is not
sick to continue teaching in school increased from 33% to 72% for females and from 46% to 77% for
males aged 15 to 49 over the period 2000-2005.59

         Rwandans living with HIV/AIDS have benefited from changes which have improved their
quality of life. Not surprisingly, the descriptive results of the PBF baseline data survey show that HIV
patients have a less positive outlook on their life than non patients.

        Despite this reality, Rwandan patients have seen the quality of life improve substantially in two
important respects. First, they have benefited from a highly supportive environment for care and
support, including:

     ARV drugs are free (even though patients face transportation and other indirect costs).

     Travel time and costs have been reduced for patients who no longer need to go long distances
        for various lab tests.

     Access to community health insurance has boosted overall utilization of health services.

     Home-based care for bed ridden patients and psycho-social support for patients and family
        members have been expanded.

        Stakeholders report that, and the volume of both HIV and non-HIV tests increased at a sample of
laboratories reviewed by an external consultant for the medium-term review.

        Persons living with HIV/AIDS have benefited from initiatives to increase their ability to
cope with the economic effects of their illness. The PBF baseline survey found that households with
HIV/AIDS-related deaths also have a higher probability of selling assets and that income generating
activities are more likely to be negatively affected. At the MAP-supported sites, illness during the last 6
months was reported by about 64% of patients (in contrast to roughly 14% of non-patients); transport
costs were 4 times higher for patients; about 8% of patients reported restricted work levels during past 7
days (in comparison to about 2% for non-patients); and quality of life indicators were consistently worse
for patients.

        Given the socio-economic impact of the disease and the expected increased lifespan of those
benefiting from the expansion of ART, the project promoted an increased ability for vulnerable
households and populations to cope economically with the effects of the disease by: (i) paying school
fees for about 28,000 orphans and vulnerable children; (ii) subsidizing community health insurance for
over a quarter of a million individuals; and (iii) financing over 700 associations of PLWHA to provide
home-based care and psycho-social support to those infected or affected by HIV/AIDS. The following
table 24 indicates the number of households and individuals which received project support.

        Though the MAP did not evaluate directly the impact of this support, an evaluation of a project
with a similar approach to supporting PLWHA found that 94% were very satisfied with the health
benefits received, while 69% were satisfied with the housing benefits. Conversely, only 42% stated that
they were able to eat 2-3 times a day; 58% indicated their difficulties in eating adequately.60

        Overall, with the support from the government and other donors, Rwanda has managed to scale
up support for OVCs aged 10-14 with the ratio of school attendance between orphans and non-orphans

increasing from 0.61 to 0.77 for males and from 0.69 to 0.86 for females from 2000 to 2005. Still, there
is still room for improvement, as only 75% of children who had lost both parents attended school in
contrast to 91% whose parents are alive.

          At the same time, the project recognized that these measures could not be sustained indefinitely
and initiated some 800 sub-projects (approximately two-thirds of all sub projects) for income-generating
activities. Anecdotal evidence from the MAP sub-projects illustrates how these vulnerable groups were
able to gain new skills, learn their HIV status, benefit from health insurance, and regain their dignity.
Key stakeholders report that working through associations (which was a prerequisite for participating in
the income generation projects) has created a sense of solidarity in a country torn by genocide and war.
Beneficiaries also report satisfaction with the MAP approach which empowered them to find solutions
to their problems and entrusted them to manage these funds. The Government's            ICR notes that the
common denominator of these associations is the vulnerability of the members which has meant that
members have worked with the principal objective of generating income for the costs associated with
treatment rather than for saving and future investment.61

          From an economic perspective, the Bank's technical review cites a number of case studies in
concluding that the impact of the income generating activities appears to have been "substantial."62 The
UNDP evaluation of its income generating sub projects found that 73% of them were successful, and
some 68% of association members found the revenues generated by the sub-projects to be satisfactory or
acceptable.   63

Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis

Economic impact of the Rwanda MAP Multi-Sectoral HIV/AIDS Project

        No specific economic analysis was carried out at project preparation for the Rwanda MAP.
Instead, the PAD referred to the economic analysis contained in the Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program
for the Africa Region (Report No. 20727 AFR), which included a cost-benefit analysis of HIV/AIDS
interventions and an assessment of the overall impact of HIV/AIDS on the economy. The main findings
of the assessment as summarized in the PAD were as follows:

     HIV/AIDS has a negative effect on productivity levels, domestic savings and overall economic
        growth.

     HILV/AIDS increases health costs and runs the risks of crowding out other key public health
        programs, such as immunization, maternal and child health, malaria and parasitic diseases.

     Care and treatment of AIDS patients imposes high costs on families and reduces their earning
        capacity.

     Family coping strategies may result in children abandoning school or the family cutting other
        health or social expenditures to unacceptable levels.

        In addition, under the PHRD grant two studies were prepared to analyze the impact of
HIV/AIDS on the health sector and on households.

         Though difficult to quantify and impossible to attribute solely to the MAP, a number of
potentially positive economic impacts of the project have been highlighted in the text and are
summarized by level in the following paragraphs.

         Individual level. The PAD did not focus on the individual patient level, but the project almost
certainly contributed to some positive benefits for prevention and treatment at this level.

         Prevention: The Rwanda MAP did not use prevalence and incidence estimates as a basis for
estimating future project benefits resulting from averting infection. Instead, the argument for the
potentially positive economic impact of the project on prevention is based on the findings that:

     comprehensive knowledge has more than doubled during 2000-2005, reaching about 54% for
         females and close to 57% for males;

     most young Rwandans are protected from HIV infection: the percentage of females at risk of
         HIV (i.e. with multiple partners and no condom use at last sex) was estimated at only 1% while
         the percentage of males at risk for HIV is also low (about 2%);

     sexually active Rwandans are increasingly seeking testing for HIV: the percentage of women
         and men ever receiving an HIV test increased from 5% to 21% and 7% to 20% respectively
         between 2000 and 2005; and

     HIV+ patients had lower levels of reported sexual activity and dramatically higher levels of
         condom use than non-patients.


                                                                                                                              45

       In other words, the necessary elements for slowing the spread of HIV, particularly among youths,
who are the most potentially productive segment of the population, would seem to be in place.

        Treatment: The Rwanda MAP did not attempt to estimate the potential number of deaths that
could be or were averted by introducing ART, but the positive impact of treatment seems clear based on
the findings that:

     Rwanda has nearly attained universal adult coverage for ART. Since 2002, Rwanda has
        progressed from providing services at 4 urban sites to 870 patients (able to pay) to over 165 sites
        nationwide with close to 56,000 patients (treated free of charge); its coverage rate of about 70%
        (in comparison with the sub-Saharan African average of 30%) places it second among the
        regions performers.

     Management of PLWHA has improved with: (i) enrollment rates based on average CD4 and
        WHO stage on enrollment comparable to those in other countries; and (ii) relatively low loss to
        follow up; and

     HIV/AIDS related mortality increased steeply through 2003 and then declined progressively
        with the scale up of the ART program.

        Though the exact number of deaths averted is not known, it seems certain that this number has
been substantial.

        Household/Institution levels. The PAD emphasized the effects of HIV/AIDS on households,
and the project focused on the most effective and efficient means for helping them cope with the direct
and indirect costs of illness. A study carried out by the project of the household burden of HIV/AIDS
patients in comparison with non-patient households shows that the former have lower levels of labor
market participation, higher health costs, and poorer quality of life. The baseline survey found that: (i)
close to 19% of patients suffered from work restrictions in last 7 days compared to 3.4% of non-patients;
and (ii) roughly 70% of HIV patients had an illness in last six months in contrast to 17.3% of non-
patients. Figure 5 presents the health care costs (in Rwandan francs) of HIV patients and non patients in
the baseline survey.

        Not surprisingly, the baseline data survey also found HIV patients to be generally unhappier
than non-patients as shown in the following figure:

        Given the socio-economic impact of the disease and the expected increased lifespan of those
benefiting from the expansion of ART, the project used different institutions (umbrellas, NGOs,
community-based organizations, associations, etc.) to increase the ability of vulnerable households and
populations to cope economically with the effects of the disease by: (i) paying school fees for about
28,000 orphans and vulnerable children; (ii) subsidizing community health insurance for over a quarter
of a million individuals; and (iii) financing over 700 associations of PLWHA to provide home-based
care and psycho-social support to those infected or affected by HIV/AIDS.

        Further, as expressed in the follow-up beneficiary assessment, beneficiaries of MAP funded sub
projects believe that these activities contributed to the overall quality of their lives through:

     reduced poverty by increasing their ability to provide for their essential needs and even to
        undertake larger investments (in housing or for expanding their business);

     better health by improving nutritional status, reducing financial barriers to health services
        (through the collective insurance schemes or mutuelles), and increasing the availability of
        lifesaving drugs; and

     increased self-esteem and family well-being by participating in the associative and cooperative
        movements and contributing to the overall family economy.

In addition, beneficiaries felt that the MAP projects had contributed to changing both their own and
others' attitudes and behaviors and to reducing stigma. With these changes, beneficiaries reflected a
sense of increased empowerment in many respects: physical, psychological, professional, and economic.

        Though not precisely determinable, it seems clear that the project's contribution to mitigating the
epidemic's direct and indirect costs at the household level has been significant.

        Government level. The project addressed non-health government agencies as well as the
Ministry of Health.

        Non-health agencies: Though not explicitly measured, the effects of the project on the
uniformed services was probably substantial, especially in terms of prevention, through the distribution
of condoms and the increase in voluntary counseling and testing. Benefits among other non-health

agencies and for the local government agencies are less likely to have been substantial, particularly after
the mid-term review when project funds were shifted from IEC activities to impact mitigation activities.

        Health agencies: The PAD's concern that the cost of HIV/AIDS might crowd out other key
public health programs was attenuated by two elements. First, as table 26 below shows, though
HIV/AIDS expenditures rose dramatically in absolute terms and as a proportion of total health
expenditures, the remaining amounts available for other health services would seem to be significant.

                                Table 26: Evolution of expenditures on HIV/AIDS

                     Expenditures             2000          2002          2003         2006

             Total HIV/AIDS expenditures     $5,729,423 $13,804,359        nd        $73,373,091

             Source: MoH, National Health Accounts (2006), pp. 10, 34. No HIV sub account analysis
             was conducted in 2003.


        The conclusions are similar from the perspective of a comparison of total health expenditures
with HIV/AIDS expenditures as a proportion of GDP, as can be seen in table 27:

               Table 27: Evolution of total health expenditures on HIV/AIDS as proportion of GDP

                  Health Expenditures          2000         2002          2003           2006

        Second, as was noted in the text, a range of MAP expenditures for HIV/AIDS were in fact
directed at the health sector systems strengthening as a whole (e.g., laboratory and infrastructure
development, human resources capacity building, procurement, etc.) rather than exclusively at
HIV/AIDS.
        Economy. The effects of the project's impact on the economy as a whole have not been closely
examined; it is probably too soon, and there are certainly other confounding factors. But with presumed
declining incidence, increasing numbers of patients treated, and improved efforts to mitigate the effects
of the disease, the project did contribute to those elements which would be expected to have an effect on
productivity and the economy as a whole.

Financial sustainability of the Rwanda MAP Multi-Sectoral HIV/AIDS Project

        From a strictly financial perspective, the sustainability of the project's benefits would seem to be
assured by the presence of the Global Fund and PEPFAR among other partner agencies. In fact, the
Government did not request additional IDA assistance for HIV/AIDS, and the exit plan described earlier
provided for an orderly (if not entirely complete) handover of MAP commitments to other agencies.

        The prospects of sustaining the public sector and civil society activities funded under the project
are mixed with some associations being self sufficient, other organizations attracting new sources of
financing, and some institutions may be adversely affected if they do not identify alternative sources of
funding. Of immediate concern at project closing was the future of the children benefiting from
payment of school fees, as authorities had not yet identified alternative sources of funding for all of
them. The government is making a concerted effort to bring all HIV spending on budget and to reflect
this spending in the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework. Nevertheless, there is still considerable
room for improvement, and continuing concerns over financial sustainability in light of the heavy
dependence on donors.

Annex 5: Beneficiary Survey Results

Background
         The initial (2006) and follow-up (2008) beneficiary assessments addressed many similar
questions, including opinions about: (i) the relative importance of MAP's different interventions; (ii) the
areas where MAP most contributed to preventing the spread of HIV, improving the lives of persons
living with HIV/AIDS; and (iii) the strengths and weaknesses of MAP's approach. In addition, several
questions asked during the initial assessment were not asked in the later assessment (and vise versa).

     The 2006 assessment included questions on women's opinions about the MAP interventions and
         on needs not addressed by the MAP, and these were not repeated in 2008.

     The 2008 assessment asked questions about MAP's contribution to capacity building and to the
         future sustainability of the interventions.

         While both assessments used focus groups, the responses were tabulated differently, with the
initial assessment allowing for multiple responses and the follow-up assessment relying on single
responses. As a result, the comparisons presented below between the two assessments can only be
considered indicative.

Results

         Both the 2006 and the 2008 assessments noted the importance of MAP for supporting revenue
generating projects, educational fees, and health care costs. The 2006 assessment also emphasized the
importance of the MAP for HIV prevention and OVC support, but these were mentioned somewhat less
frequently in the 2008 follow-up.

         In both 2006 and 2008, beneficiaries cited the importance of MAP for increasing knowledge of
the illness, encouraging beneficiaries to learn their HIV status, and promoting behavior change for both
HIV+ and HIV- individuals. The fact that participation in an association required members to know
their HIV status was considered an important aspect of the MAP.

         The 2008 assessment indicated that MAP beneficiaries appreciated in almost equal measures the
project's contribution to increased information, improved economic productivity, and more interaction
with other elements of society.

         The 2006 assessment noted that, in contrast to men, women tend to be more active in the
associations and better appreciate the potential for increased training and information to contribute to
income-generating activities, perhaps because of their more limited access to training, understanding of
the importance of improved access to health services, and responsibilities for the children and other
members of the family.

         The results from the two assessments show the importance of the MAP for increasing life
expectancy and well being, reducing stigma and discrimination, and encouraging hope in the future.

Conclusions

         Both assessments highlighted the importance of the MAP projects as a means of responding
appropriately to the expressed needs of the beneficiaries. Beneficiaries also indicated that the
transparency of the project selection process contributed to the success of the selected projects. The
assessments found that financing was at times insufficient and difficult to access and that supervision of
the MAP projects was sometimes inadequate.

         In general, beneficiaries of MAP funded projects expressed their belief that these projects had
contributed to the overall quality of their lives through:



                                                                                                         51

     reduced poverty by increasing their ability to provide for their essential needs and even to
        undertake larger investments (in housing or for expanding their business);

     better health by improving nutritional status, reducing financial barriers to health services
        (through the collective insurance schemes or mutuelles), and increasing the availability of
        lifesaving drugs; and

     increased self-esteem and family well-being by participating in the associative and cooperative
        movements and contributing to the overall family economy.

        In addition, beneficiaries felt that the MAP projects had contributed to changing both their own
and others' attitudes and behaviors and to reducing stigma. With these changes, beneficiaries reflected a
sense of increased empowerment in many respects: physical, psychological, professional, and economic.
Finally, most beneficiaries were optimistic that the gains achieved with MAP support would provide
benefits into the future without additional support because of the knowledge and skills acquired to
increase revenues and or to gain access to other sources of capital.

        The only groups expressing their pessimism about being able to continue without additional
MAP support were widows, girls, and young heads of households.

INTRODUCTION

        When the Government of Rwanda submitted its proposal for the MAP project, the sero
prevalence rate was estimated at 11% for the population as a whole and 13.5% for pregnant women
attending antenatal care at sentinel surveillance sites in predominantly urban sites. The most recent
DHS results (from 2005) establish the HIV prevalence rate at 3% with large variations by sex (2.3% for
men and 3.6% for women) and by residence (2.2% in rural areas and 7.6% in urban areas).

        Rwanda's political and technical response to the epidemic pre-dated project preparation. In
addition to the Poverty Reduction Strategy and the Vision 2020 which provided the overarching
framework for the country, the Government had prepared national policies, strategic plans, guidelines
and directives to address the disease. In addition, a number of structures were established, including a
national commission (CNLS), a technical secretariat within the Ministry of Health, and a national center
for treatment and research (TRAC).

        Within this context, the MAP financed the implementation of the Government's strategy over the
period from October 2003 to October 2008. The Bank provided an initial grant of US$ 30.5 million was
and a supplemental grant of US$ 10.0 million while the Government contributed US$ 1.5 million. The
project comprised two development objectives: (i) to strengthen prevention measures in order to slow
down the spread of HIV/AIDS, and (ii) to expand support and care for those infected or affected by
HIV/AIDS. Project implementation was managed by a project management unit (UCP) under the aegis
of the National AIDS Commission (CNLS) in close collaboration with the Ministry of Health.

        The project's beneficiaries included: (i) persons infected with HIV as well as persons affected by
the epidemic; (ii) persons at high risk of becoming infected with the disease (sex workers, unemployed
youths, widows); (iii) military and police; (iv) public and private sector workers; (v) university students;
(vi) prison populations; and (vii) the population in general.

PRIVATE SECTOR AND COMMUNITY COMPONENT

        This component aimed to support: (i) efforts by private sector enterprises; and (ii) partnerships
with community-based groups (PLWHA, youths, orphans, women, prostitutes, etc.), NGOs (national
and international), non profit associations, religious groups. Activities were financed through annual
action plans submitted by:

     umbrella organizations who were already established in the country and known for their ability
        to reach the most vulnerable and at-risk groups; and

     supporting agencies (agences d'encadrement classified in three groups: CDC/Districts, religious
        groups, and national/international NGOs) who were selected competitively to supervise
        implementation of the approved sub-projects for smaller community groups and associations.

        The project was particularly successful with ex prostitutes: Beginning with the success of a
single association, the project eventually supported 18 associations (and more than 1100 ex prostitutes),
which received almost US$ 400,000 in financing for 43 sub projects. To ensure their continued viability,
the project worked with the Ministry of Commerce to transform these associations into cooperatives. To
date fourteen of the eighteen associations have become cooperatives.

        While noting the large and continuing demands for funding from the beneficiary populations and
the difficulties of working with them, the project concluded that:

     the special focus of the umbrella organizations (youth, religion, PLWHA, etc.) provided an
         effective means for reaching previously inaccessible groups;

     the supporting agencies provided an effective and efficient (with a maximum of 15% of costs
         for management) means for reaching community-based organizations; and

     the use of the administrative districts proved to be an effective way to identify vulnerable
         groups (and particularly children) and to control their attendance in school.

        The project exit plan provided measures for continuation of these activities (through the
umbrellas, for school support to orphans and vulnerable children, and for the sub projects) after project
closing.

PUBLIC SECTOR COMPONENT

        This component aimed to help public sector institutions integrate the fight against HIV/AIDS by
financing a range of activities including policy formulation, HIV sensitization and mobilization, and
prevention particularly through the expansion of VTC services. The project supported both the program
coordinating structures (the CNLS at national level, the CPLS at provincial level and subsequently the
CDLS at district level) and the line ministries.

        Initially, the project focused on strengthening the capacities of six structures: CNLS, 3 CPLS
(Byumba, Cyangugu, and Gitarama), and 2 ministries (Defense and Local Affairs). In 2004, the number
of public sector action plans increased to 17 in 2004 and 45 in 2006, due in large measure to the
decentralization of the administration which replaced the 3 CPLS with 30 CDLS. Prior to the
decentralization, the project financed the salaries of four staff per CPLS; after the decentralization in
January 2006, the project financed the salaries of 13 staff which provided technical assistance to the
CDLS. The project also financed staff positions in several ministries, the documentation center, and the
public sector umbrella organization (USPLS), which was created in 2006 and integrated into the
Ministry of Civil Service and Labor in 2008 to provide a means for continuing support to the ministry
action plans.

        The major activities of the public sector component included: formulation of policy and strategy
documents, meetings and sensitization of local administrative authorities; production of IEC materials,
organization of national events and mass communication, training, distribution of condoms, etc.
Beginning in 2005, the project rehabilitated and equipped 11 VCT centers (7 for Defense and 4 for the
National Police).

        Public sector institutions had a particularly important role in the distribution of condoms: Of the
total number of 17,484,434 condoms distributed by all beneficiaries of project financing, 12,414,402
(71%) were distributed by public sector institutions. Of the 12+ million, 87% were distributed by the
military and police. The project also contributed significantly to the establishment and operation of the
Documentation Center of the CNLS as well as the Hotline SOS Sida telephone service.

        While noting the administrative difficulties of fully incorporating the CDLS into the district
organizational chart, transferring funds and receiving reports, and accounting for the overall
expenditures, the project concluded that:

     the support for capacity building of CNLS strengthened partnerships (both within the country
        and among international agencies) and coordination (with a mapping of interventions to avoid
        duplication; and

     the decentralization of the administration was increased both the access of the project to the
        population (and particularly rural communities) and the speed of information and training
        activities

        To ensure the continuation of these activities after project closing, the project (through the
CNLS) transferred responsibility: (i) for the CDLS staff and activities to the districts (with financial
support from UNDP); (ii) for the ministry action plans to the USPLS within the Ministry of Civil
Service and Labor, which is charged with mobilizing adequate resources; and (iii) for the operations of
the Documentation Center to the CNLS. Continued support for the uniformed services was envisioned
through their respective budgets as well as through funding from other partners (Global Fund, United
States, etc.)

CARE AND TREATMENT COMPONENT

        This component aimed specifically to expand care and treatment for HIV/AIDS (limited in 2002
to some 900 patients receiving care from 22 practitioners through the national hospitals) and more
generally to strengthen the health system as a whole. The model for expanded care and treatment was


                                                                                                            57

developed jointly by TRAC and CDC, and the project focused initially on: (i) improving the skills of
health care providers; (ii) rehabilitating and equipping sites to initiate VCC and ARV services; (iii)
recruiting additional personnel to meet the increased workload; and (iv) procuring and distributing the
necessary laboratory supplies and drugs. In addition, the project introduced two important
complementary activities: performance-based financing and biomedical waste management.

         The project initially tested approaches for VCT (in 5 health districts), PMTCT (in 5 health
facilities), and management of PLWHA (in 9 sites through TRAC). As shown in table 35, the number
of institutions benefiting from project support grew, with a major increase linked to decentralization of
services in 2006.

        The original project had as its objective to ensure the treatment of 2350 patients. A combination
of improved procurement methods (CPDS) and negotiated reductions in the cost of ARV (with the help
of the Clinton Foundation) led the project to increase its projections to 5000 patients; ultimately, 9201
patients received ARV treatment. The progression of treatment and MAP's contribution is shown in

        Several measures were taken to increase protective measures for the personnel working in the
treatment centers. First, the Ministry of Health formulated a policy regarding injections and
management of biomedical waste; then the project financed the construction of 15 Montfort incinerators
as well as training 15 operators of the incinerators and 250 staff in the management of biomedical waste.

        While noting the delays in completing the rehabilitation of the health facilities, the logistical
difficulties of organizing the laboratory analyses (especially the CD counts), and the instability among
health personnel, the project concluded that:

     the decentralization of diagnostic and treatment services greatly contributed to the geographic
        expansion of ARV coverage, especially in very rural areas, while the introduction of highly
        subsidized care contributed to financial access to services; and



                                                                                                                      59

     the establishment of the coordinated procurement and distribution system at the end of 2004 and
        the negotiation of ARV prices through the Clinton Foundation contributed both the number of
        patients treated and to the development of CAMERWA's procurement capabilities

        To ensure the continuation of these activities after project closing, the project arranged: (i) for
16 sites to be transferred to Intrahealth and EGPAF via PEPFAR (for the districts of Ngoma, Kayonza,
Gatsibo, Nyagatare), to Catholic Relief Services (for the district of Nyamasheke), and to the Global
Fund for the remaining 15 sites (for the districts of Nyanza, Gisagara, Huye et Rusizi); (ii) for the 279
personnel hired by the project to have their contracts transferred to the civil service or PEPFAR (221
staff) or to the health centers where they were working (55 staff); and (iii) the performance-based
financing scheme for Cyangugu and Butare transferred to the current Global Fund and PEPFAR projects
while awaiting the generalization of the scheme via Global Fund financing (Round 7).

        ARV sites supported by the Nyamasheke disctricts MAP Projet have been integrated to the
Catholic Relief Service (CRS) suppport program, those from the East province currently benefit from
the Intrahealth and EGPAF support. Lastly, sites from the Nyanza, Huye, Gisagara et Rusizi disctricts
benefit from the «Fonds Mondial» financing (Project VIH R6) since July of this year.

MANAGEMENT, MONITORING AND EVALUATION COMPONENT

        This component aimed to: (i) ensure the coordination and management of the project's activities
and (ii) strengthen the monitoring and evaluation capabilities of both the project and the national
program.

        Management of project activities was based in large part on the annual action plans of the
beneficiary institutions. At the end of the project 212 institutions had received project funding: 54
public sector institutions (CNLS, CPLS/CDLS, ministries and other national agencies); 121 private
sector and community institutions (umbrellas national and international NGOs, religious organizations,
and district CDC); 37 health sector institutions (31 ARV sites, the National Laboratory, TRAC, the
l'UPDC/Intégration, CAMERWA, MEMESA/Cordaid and the National School of Public Health for
Southern Province). A total of 497 annual action plans was approved and financed.

        The project established procedures to ensure monitoring and evaluation of the annual action
plans, including training; development and diffusion of methods and tools (e.g. TOMPRO, MS Access)
for both the project management unit and the beneficiary institutions at all levels; and organization of
regular project reviews.

        As indicated in table 40, between 2003 and 2008, the project submitted 132 withdrawal
applications, in the total amount of US$ 45.8 million and received US$ 43.2 million. The amount
received is greater than the dollar amount of the grant due to currency fluctuations to the project's
benefit.

        The rapidity with which the Bank processed the withdrawal applications was a positive factor in
the project's strong disbursement record: 60% of the withdrawal applications were treated and the
projects bank accounts credited within 15 days of submission. Table 41 presents the status of project
expenditures by budget category:

       A summary of the project's output indicators may be found in Annex 2a.

       While noting the delays in beneficiary reporting, the low disbursement of counterpart funding,
and the unjustified expenditures of several districts, the project concluded that:

    project implementation was efficiently implemented through the joint efforts of the PMU and
       the Bank team, particularly with respect to reimbursement requests and requests for non
       objections (for which almost 90% were provided within two weeks);

    the merger of the MAP and Global Fund management units contributed to efficiencies both in
       salary costs for the two units and in the stability of the personnel as MAP staff realized that they
       would continue afterwards with Global Fund financing; and

    the decentralization of the monitoring and evaluation system contributed to an improvement in
       the quality of information, better monitoring of district activities, and increased interest on the
       part of the local authorities and the communities.
