Following a review of the\n            country's legal framework, which specifies the rights\n            of indigenous people as included in the Constitution, the\n            General Education Act, the Primary Education Regulations,\n            and recent regulations created by the National\n            Inter-Cultural Bilingual Education Directorate, measures are\n            hereby identified, specifically on inter-cultural bilingual\n            education. Teaching materials for inter-cultural bilingual\n            education are a substantive component of the strategy, and,\n            student education materials will be distributed, including\n            textbooks for language and mathematics. Alternative\n            materials for multi-grade, and single teacher classrooms\n            will also be prepared, as will educational modules for\n            preschool education from a self-paced perspective, using\n            indigenous languages as primary, with Spanish as secondary\n            language. Participatory approaches will involve regional\n            teams, including indigenous peoples, whose dynamic should\n            facilitate the internal, and external review processes.\n            Validation and completion of textbook production, will be\n            followed by adjustments, and reprinting as needed. Classroom\n            libraries will be gradually established for early childhood\n            bilingual education, in three languages: Quechua, Aymara,\n            and Aguaruna, and, by 2005 in three additional languages:\n            Shipibo, Chayahuita, and Ashaninka. A curriculum proposal\n            will be prepared, and introduced related to the needs, and\n            demands as identified during consultations among bilingual\n            people, followed by due progress in introducing bilingual\n            study programs."}, "docdt": "2002-05-31T00:32:00Z"}
