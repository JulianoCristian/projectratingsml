Some lessons learned included:\n            this project was designed as the first phase of an Adaptable\n            Program Loans (APLs). APLs support a long term vision and\n            depend on the compliance of agreed triggers linked to the\n            medium term sector policies. This instrument is relevant\n            when institutions are strong and have a track record of\n            consistency for a period of time that goes beyond that\n            expected for the project itself. While this project was\n            designed during a period when the Ministry of Education had\n            shown continuity in its policies, the frequent changes in\n            Ministers and the subsequent changes in vision were not\n            foreseen. Thus, this type of lending instrument was not\n            appropriate for such a highly uncertain context where the\n            continuity of the sector policy framework was not in place.\n            In such cases, selecting a sector investment loan might have\n            been more effective. Political support is linked to\n            decision-making about human and financial resources\n            allocation to ensure adequate implementation of a project.\n            In the case of this project, the frequent changes in\n            ministers (there were six different Ministers, whose average\n            tenure, was about one year) and the consequent changes of\n            Directors and Project Managers, resulted in reduced\n            ownership of the project and changes in priorities. As a\n            result, the higher levels of the Ministry did not prioritize\n            the project and human resource allocation weakened with\n            time. Even though the Bank team discussed the project with\n            all new incoming teams, the vision of improving rural\n            education was lost for other priorities brought by the new\n            administrations. Thus, political risk is critical for\n            project implementation."}, "docdt": "2008-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
