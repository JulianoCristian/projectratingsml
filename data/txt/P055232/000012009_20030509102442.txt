A. 
Program 
Purpose 
and 
Project Development Objective 
1. 
Program 
purpose 
and 
program 
phasing: 
The 
Program 
will 
support 
the Peruvian 
government’s strategy 
for 
improving 
the 
quality 
and 
equity 
of 
basic 
education through 
focused investments 
in 
rural 
areas 
with 
the 
lowest education indicators 
and 
through 
systemic 
reforms 
of 
teacher 
policy 
and 
education 
management. 
Vision: 
The 
Government’s 
priorities 
are 
to 
reduce 
the  large disparities 
in 
schooling 
access 
and 
completion 
between 
rural 
and 
urban 
areas 
and 
to 
achieve 
a 
substantial 
increase 
in 
the 
quality 
and 
efficiency 
of 
the education 
system 
overall. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
the reforms 
and 
investments 
to 
be 
supported 
by 
the 
APL, 
it 
is 
expected 
that 
by 
2013: 
(a) 
Peru 
will 
be 
able 
to 
achieve 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goal 
of 
universal 
primary 
completion, 
by 
increasing the 
gross 
completion 
rate 
in 
rural 
areas 
from 
82 
percent, 
currently 
to 
97 
percent; 
(b) 
the 
share 
of 
rural 
children 
with 
access 
to 
early 
child 
development programs 
will 
increase 
from 
1 
percent 
currently 
to 
10 
percent; 
(c) 
the 
secondary 
school 
coverage 
rate 
in 
rural 
areas 
will 
increase 
from 
9 
percent 
currently 
to 
17 percent; and 
(d) 
Peru’s achievement 
on 
national 
standardized 
assessments 
will 
improve reflecting 
the increased 
capacity 
of 
the 
education 
system 
to 
deliver 
a 
relevant 
curriculum 
and 
effective 
teaching 
to 
all 
children. 
Strategies: 
This 
vision 
hinges on 
several 
mutually 
reinforcing 
strategies: 
Improvements 
in 
education  coverage  and  quality 
in 
the 
rural 
areas 
where 
28 
percent 
of 
Peru’s 
population 
lives. 
Access 
to 
initial 
education, preschool, 
and 
secondary 
education 
- 
all 
of 
which 
are 
currently 
very 
limited 
in 
rural 
areas 
-- 
would 
be increased 
significantly 
through 
a 
focused 
program 
of 
new 
investments, 
including 
an 
innovative 
distance 
education 
strategy 
for 
cost-effective  expansion 
of 
secondary 
education. 
For 
primary 
education, 
where 
coverage 
is 
better, 
the 
focus 
would 
be  on 
substantially  increasing quality,  through 
expanded 
bilingual 
education, 
more 
effective 
support 
for 
multigrade 
schools,  teacher 
upgrading, 
decentralized school 
management, 
and more 
effective 
school 
networking, supervision and 
support. 
Zncrease 
in 
the quality 
of 
teachers and teaching, 
achieved 
through 
a 
major 
reform 
of 
teacher 
preparation 
with 
the 
introduction 
of 
a 
continuous 
training 
and 
support 
program, teacher 
standards, 
teacher career 
path, 
pay 
and 
incentives 
mechanisms. 
Under 
this 
reform, 
a 
number 
of 
interventions 
would 
take 
place, 
including 
(a) 
development 
of 
clear teaching 
standards 
that 
would 
serve 
as 
the 
framework 
for 
the redesign 
of 
teacher 
pre-service 
and 
in-service 
training 
program, 
(b) 
the 
restructuring 
of 
teacher 
incentives 
and 
career 
plan 
to 
reward 
competency and 
provide 
adequate 
incentives 
to 
attract 
teachers 
to 
remote 
rural 
areas, 
and 
(c) 
a 
new accreditation 
system 
for 
teacher 
training 
institutes 
to 
make 
entry 
into 
the profession 
more 
competitive 
and 
preparation more effective. 
Overhaul 
of 
education 
system 
management 
to 
increase accountability 
for 
results. 
The 
third 
strategy 
is 
to 
substantially  improve  the  effectiveness 
of 
education 
system 
management 
through 
decentralization, 
clarified 
governance, 
and 
better 
measurement 
of 
outcomes 
so 
that 
actors 
at 
all 
levels 
of 
the 
system can 
be 
held 
accountable 
for 
results. 
School-level 
management 
will 
be 
strengthened 
by 
involving 
parents and 
community 
members. 
Networks 
will 
be 
developed 
to 
link 
small 
isolated 
schools 
in 
rural 
areas 
for 
coordinated  planning,  experience 
sharing 
and  training. 
Sub-central  supervisory 
offices 
will 
be 
streamlined, 
upgraded, 
and 
made 
accountable 
for 
the  results 
of 
schools 
in 
their 
area. 
Standardized 
assessments 
of 
student 
learning 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
periodically 
to 
provide 
essential 
feedback 
on 
how 
education 
quality 
is 
improving. 
The clear 
standards 
for 
teacher 
recruitment, 
systematic 
student 
learning 
assessments, 
and  the  transparent 
accreditation 
of 
training 
institutions 
will 
all 
improve 
the 
overall 
direction, 
transparency 
and alignment 
of 
the education 
system.

Education 
for 
democracy and 
intercultural 
sensitivity. 
Simultaneously, 
greater 
attention 
will 
be 
given 
to 
the 
intercultural 
dimension throughout the 
curriculum 
in 
order 
to 
build 
respect 
for 
diversity 
and stronger 
civic 
and 
democratic 
values. 
Bilingual 
education 
for 
pre-school 
and 
primary 
school 
will 
be 
offered 
in 
at 
least 14 
vernacular 
languages. 
Research demonstrates 
that 
the 
strategy 
of 
introducing literacy 
through 
the 
mother tongue 
and 
treating 
Spanish 
as 
a 
second 
language can 
be 
expected 
to 
improve significantly 
their 
learning 
outcomes, 
motivation, 
and 
retention 
in 
school. 
Indigenous 
peoples 
strategy. 
The 
fifth 
strategy 
is 
to 
support  the 
substantial 
improvement 
of 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the educational 
system 
for 
indigenous populations and where vernacular 
languages are 
spoken. 
One 
third 
of 
the 
national population 
speak 
one 
of 
Peru’s 
42 
indigenous 
languages 
and a 
large 
proportion 
live 
in 
rural 
areas, 
hence, 
a 
quality rural 
education 
project 
has 
to 
incorporate activities 
directly 
approaching 
such 
populations. 
The  indigenous 
strategy 
incorporates 
community  participation 
and 
consultation, 
both 
at 
local,  regional 
and 
national 
levels, 
including 
national 
meetings 
for 
indigenous 
teachers, 
preparation 
and 
validation 
of 
materials, 
pre and in-service 
teacher 
training for 
intercultural 
bilingual 
education, 
cumculum 
development, 
research, 
community 
outreach, 
and 
administrative 
measures 
such 
as 
revisiting 
school 
calendars, 
defining 
criteria 
for 
teacher 
employment, 
and 
participatory 
project 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation. 
Demand-side 
interventions. 
Finally, to 
ensure 
that equity 
concerns 
are 
adequately 
addressed, 
during 
Phase 
I 
complementary 
studies 
will 
be 
conducted 
to 
determine the 
desirability 
and 
feasibility 
of 
complementing 
the 
proposed supply-side 
approach 
with 
targeted 
demand-side 
interventions 
such 
as 
subsidies 
to 
the very poorest 
families 
to 
keep 
children 
in 
school, 
such 
as 
Brazil’s 
Bolsa 
Escola 
program 
and 
Mexico’s 
PROGRESA. 
Thus, 
the 
program 
would 
span 
systemwide 
quality 
and 
efficiency 
reforms,  along 
with 
policies 
and 
investments 
specifically 
targeted 
to 
the 
rural 
areas 
with 
lowest education 
outcomes, 
which 
are 
also 
very 
largely 
the 
poorest  regions 
of 
Peru. 
The  program 
will 
build 
on 
existing 
elements 
(e.g. 
the 
competency-based 
student 
curriculum) 
while 
in 
other 
areas 
(e.g, 
teacher 
policy) 
it 
will 
initiate 
substantial 
reforms. 
Program 
Phasing: 
The Program 
will 
be 
supported 
by 
a ten-year 
Adaptable Program 
Loan 
- 
APL 
-- 
to 
help 
design, 
evaluate and 
implement 
these 
policy 
and 
institutional 
reforms 
and 
the 
needed 
investments. 
The 
ten-year 
Program 
will 
be carried out 
in 
three 
phases, 
lasting 
four, three and three 
years 
respectively, 
as 
follows: 
Phase 
I 
(FY 
2004-2007. 
US$94.2 
million 
equivalent): 
Under 
Phase 
I, 
financing 
would 
be 
provided 
to 
support the 
implementation 
of 
key 
reforms 
of 
teaching 
and 
system 
management, 
initiate 
the investments 
in 
rural 
school 
infrastructure 
and 
quality 
enhancements, 
and 
pilot 
and 
evaluate 
alternative models 
of 
distance 
education 
at 
the 
secondary 
level.  Specifically, the 
program would: 
(a) 
expand 
access 
to 
formal 
and 
non-formal 
initial 
and pre-school 
programs 
in 
rural 
areas; 
(b) 
pilot 
and 
evaluate three 
different 
modalities 
of 
distance education 
in 
116 
secondary schools 
in 
the 
targeted 
rural 
areas; 
(c) 
improve 
primary 
school 
quality 
in 
rural 
areas 
through 
specially 
designed 
professional development programs 
for 
rural 
teachers 
focused 
on 
multigrade 
and 
bilingual 
education, 
distribution 
of 
improved learning 
materials, 
and 
rehabilitation 
of 
infrastructure 
where 
needed; 
and 
(d) 
raise 
sector 
efficiency 
through  the  implementation 
of 
the 
first 
phase 
of 
teacher 
policy 
reforms, 
restructuring 
of 
regional 
offices, 
initiating 
a 
decentralization 
process 
leading 
to 
more 
autonomous 
schools, 
with 
community 
voice 
in 
management, 
and 
organizing 
rural 
school support network. 
To 
monitor 
quality 
and 
guide 
corrective 
strategies, 
the  new 
national 
system 
of 
student 
assessment 
would 
be 
-4- 
Page  11
strengthened. 
The 
rural 
areas 
to 
be 
supported 
under 
the program 
were 
selected 
according 
to 
agreed 
criteria: 
education 
outcomes 
(areas 
of 
lowest 
education coverage 
and achievement); 
poverty 
level 
(lowest 
two 
income 
quintiles); 
proportion 
of 
indigenous (bilingual)  population; and commitment 
and 
receptivity 
of 
regional administration offices 
to 
the 
Project. 
Phase 
11 
(FY 
2008-2010, 
US$ 
170 
million 
equivalent): 
Based 
on 
an 
evaluation 
of 
the 
introductory 
and 
piloting 
experience gathered 
from 
Phase 
I, 
Phase 
11 
would 
expand the 
activities 
by: 
(a) 
implementing wider 
reaching, 
custom-made 
initial, 
pre-school 
and 
distance secondary 
education program 
to 
a 
limited 
geographic 
area; 
(b) 
strengthening 
and 
expanding 
the 
continuous professional 
development 
program 
for 
teachers 
and other 
education 
personnel, 
targeting 
multigrade 
and 
bilingual 
education 
program; 
expanding 
distribution 
and 
use 
of 
materials 
for 
these 
schools, 
and 
further 
rehabilitation, 
to 
a 
wider geographical 
area. 
Additional 
languages 
for 
the 
bilingual 
education 
would 
be 
included 
as 
necessary; 
and  (c) 
strengthening education 
management 
by 
fully 
implementing 
the  new 
teacher 
policy, 
and 
furthering 
decentralization 
measures 
to 
promote  school 
autonomy and accountability 
as 
per 
the 
GOPs 
decentralization 
strategy. 
Based 
on 
the 
conclusions and 
recommendations 
from 
the 
studies 
on 
demand-side 
interventions, 
pilot 
activities 
would 
be implemented 
in 
this 
area. 
Phase 
III 
(FY 
201 
1-2013. 
US$83 
million 
eauivalent): 
Based 
on 
assessment 
of 
the 
two 
previous 
phases, Phase 
III 
would 
consolidate, 
adjust 
and 
finalize 
the 
Program 
activities 
deemed 
successful 
in 
order 
to both 
warrant 
long-term 
sustainability  and promote 
renewed vision. The 
pre-school, 
initial, 
primary, 
and 
secondary 
programs 
are 
expected 
to 
be expanded 
nationwide. 
The 
new 
teacher 
policy 
will 
be 
assessed 
and 
further 
measures 
taken 
including 
the transfer 
to 
a 
compulsory 
certification 
process. 
MEDs 
decentralization 
program 
will 
be consolidated 
ensuring 
that 
roles, 
responsibilities 
and 
accountability levels 
are 
clearly 
disseminated 
and 
operational.

Strategic 
Context 
1. 
Sector-related 
Country 
Assistance 
Strategy (CAS) 
goal 
supported 
by 
the 
project: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
Document number: 
24205-PE 
Date 
of 
latest 
CAS 
discussion: 
08/19/02 
The proposed Program 
fits 
well within 
the 
overall CAS 
objective 
of 
supporting the 
government strategy 
for 
poverty 
reduction 
which 
focuses 
on 
competitiveness 
and 
employment 
generation; 
access 
to 
health; 
education, 
culture 
and 
basic 
services; and 
creating 
a 
public 
administration that 
serves 
the people. 
The 
CAS 
aims 
to 
promote 
the 
recovery 
of 
growth 
by 
investing 
in 
education, 
which 
is 
key 
to  raising 
productivity, 
especially 
for 
the poor, 
whose 
only 
asset 
is 
their 
human 
capital. 
The 
Rural 
Education 
Program 
would 
contribute 
to 
macroeconomic 
stability 
by 
improving 
the 
efficiency 
of 
social 
spending. 
As 
the 
Program's investments 
are 
targeted 
to 
the 
rural 
areas 
of 
greatest 
poverty, 
it 
would 
also 
help 
mitigate 
the impact 
of 
the 
economic 
slowdown on the poor. 
The 
Program 
will 
explicitly 
support 
the development 
of 
more 
efficient 
institutions 
in 
the education 
sector 
by 
strengthening accountability 
and 
streamlining 
regional 
administration. 
Finally, 
the 
Program 
will 
strengthen  stakeholder 
voice 
in 
education 
by 
decentralizing 
managerial 
decision-making 
process 
to 
school-level  councils 
involving 
parents  and 
community 
members. 
2. 
Main 
sector 
issues 
and 
Government 
strategy: 
Low 
quality 
of 
rural 
primary 
education 
Twenty-eight 
percent 
of 
Peru's 
population 
lives 
in 
rural 
areas, 
characterized 
by 
poverty, 
geographic 
dispersion 
and 
inaccessibility, 
and 
cultural 
diversity. 
Ninety 
percent 
of 
the 
rural 
population 
lives 
in 
clusters 
of 
less 
than 500 
people; 
60 
percent 
is 
poor 
(with 
37 percent 
below 
the 
"food only'' 
poverty 
line), 
and 
a 
third 
speaks 
one 
of 
Peru's 
42 indigenous 
languages. 
Social 
indicators 
for 
these 
populations 
are 
also 
much 
below 
those 
for 
urban populations: 
rural 
women 
average 
only 
4.9 
years 
of 
education 
as 
compared 
to 
9.1 
for 
urban 
women, 
and 
the 
infant 
mortality 
rate 
is 
58 
percent 
in 
rural, compared 
with 
32 
percent 
in 
urban, 
areas. 
Although 
Peru 
has 
done 
an 
impressive 
job 
over 
the 
last 
two 
decades 
in 
achieving universal 
access 
to 
primary 
schooling, 
average 
schooling attainment 
and 
student 
learning 
are 
sharply 
lower 
in 
rural 
than 
urban 
areas. 
While 
gross 
enrollment 
rates 
are 
similar 
for rural 
and 
urban 
areas 
(93 
percent), 
on 
time 
completion 
rates 
in 
rural 
primary 
schools are 
20 
percent 
as 
compared 
to 
57 percent 
in 
urban 
areas. 
This 
is 
the 
result 
of 
high 
repetition 
rates and 
dropout 
rates 
in 
rural 
areas 
as 
well 
as 
late 
entry 
into 
the 
system 
(23.4 
percent 
of 
poor 
rural 
children 
enter 
the 
system 
late 
as 
compared 
to 
14.2 
percent 
of 
poor 
urban 
children). 
A 
1996 
national 
learning 
assessment 
found 
that 
only 
38.5 
percent 
of 
rural 
school 
children 
mastered 
at 
least 9 
out 
of 
14 
basic competencies, 
compared 
with 
63.5 
percent 
of 
urban school children. 
Initial 
results 
of 
the 
2001 
learning 
assessment 
show 
that 
children 
in 
multigrade 
schools 
perform 
well 
below 
multi-teacher 
schools, 
and 
that 
Quechua-  and 
Aymara-speaking 
children 
score 
worst 
of 
all, 
achieving 
0 
percent and 
1 
percent 
scores 
in 
reading 
comprehension. 
Underlying 
reasons 
for 
this 
disparity 
in 
school performance include: grossly 
lower time on 
task. 
Rural 
schools 
only function 
an 
estimated 
200-250 
hours per 
year, 
compared 
with 
the 
nationally 
mandated 
1050 
hours 
for 
the 
primary 
level; 
inadequate 
learning 
materials; 
low 
teacher 
quality 
and 
motivation; 
teachers' 
inability 
to 
deliver 
bilingual 
education 
to 
indigenous 
children 
and 
lack 
of 
training 
in 
multigrade 
teaching; 
poor 
adaptation 
of 
the 
school 
to 
the 
local 
community 
and the 
agricultural 
calendar; 
and 
deficient 
school 
supervision 
and 
support.

Page  13
Low 
effective 
hours 
of 
instruction. 
About 
90 
percent 
of 
rural 
primary 
schools 
are 
small multigrade 
schools 
in 
isolated 
communities 
with 
harsh 
physical 
and 
environmental 
conditions 
which 
make 
it 
difficult 
to 
attract well-prepared 
teachers. 
Rural 
schools 
are 
generally the 
point 
of 
entry 
for 
new 
teachers 
into 
the 
education 
system, 
suffer 
high 
turnover, 
and 
tend 
to 
remain 
with 
the 
least 
effective 
teachers. 
Teacher 
housing 
is 
rudimentary, 
if 
it 
exists 
at 
all, 
and 
teachers 
often 
leave 
their 
schools 
for 
distant towns 
on 
the 
weekends, 
running 
the 
risk 
of 
not 
arriving 
back 
on 
time 
for 
class, 
or having 
to 
leave before 
the 
end 
of 
the 
school 
week,  because 
of 
limited 
transportation. 
At 
a 
minimum, 
teachers 
must 
travel 
to 
the 
provincial capital 
once 
a 
month 
to 
pickup 
their 
paychecks 
and 
needed 
supplies 
for 
the 
school, 
forcing 
them 
to 
leave 
classrooms unattended 
at 
least 
several days 
a 
month. 
These 
factors, 
combined 
with 
student 
absenteeism 
linked 
to 
climatic 
conditions 
and 
families’ 
need 
for 
children’s 
labor 
all 
contribute 
to 
very 
low 
effective hours 
of 
instruction 
in 
rural 
areas. 
Ill-adapted 
curriculum 
and teaching 
methods. 
Although 
Peru 
has 
made 
strong 
efforts 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
primary 
curriculum 
is 
relevant 
to 
children 
in 
rural 
areas, 
teachers 
are 
not trained 
in 
multigrade 
teaching 
methods, 
and 
students 
lack 
the 
self-paced 
instructional 
materials 
that are essential 
for 
effective learning 
in 
multigrade 
schools. 
The centralized 
teacher 
deployment 
system 
fails 
to 
ensure 
that 
teachers can 
speak 
the 
local 
language 
and 
deliver 
bilingual 
education 
in 
the 
early 
grades, 
another demonstrated strategy 
for 
improving 
rural 
education 
quality.  Dropout 
rates 
in 
rural 
areas 
are 
10.1 
percent, 
far 
higher 
than 
2.1 
percent 
found 
in 
urban 
areas. 
An 
estimated 
63 
percent 
of 
Quechua-speaking 
children, 
are 
over-aged, 
compared 
to 
50 
percent 
of 
all 
children. 
Deficient 
school supervision 
and 
support. 
Communication and 
access 
problems 
make 
contact 
between 
rural 
schools, 
regional 
education offices, 
and 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
sporadic 
to 
non-existent. 
In 
a 
case 
study 
carried 
out 
in 
2001, 
rural 
schools 
reported 
less 
than 
one 
supervision 
visit 
per 
year. 
However, 
a 
more 
recent 
effort 
to 
establish school-to-school 
teacher 
networks 
for 
experience sharing 
and 
collective 
work 
on common pedagogical problems 
appears 
to 
be 
having 
some 
positive 
results. 
Some 
innovative 
small-scale 
programs 
have 
piloted 
alternative 
models 
for 
assuring better school 
support and 
supervision 
in 
rural 
areas, 
notably 
the 
partnership 
between 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
and 
the 
Fe 
y 
Alegria 
organization 
for 
school supervision 
in 
the 
Quispicanchis Province. 
Low 
pre-school 
and 
initial 
education 
coverage 
in 
rural 
areas. 
Exposure 
to 
pre-school 
can 
boost 
primary 
school 
readiness 
and 
subsequent 
learning 
and attainment, 
especially 
among 
economically 
disadvantaged 
and 
indigenous children, 
such 
as 
those 
found 
in 
rural 
Peru. 
Despite the fact that 
1 year 
of 
pre-school education 
is 
mandatory 
in 
Peru, 
only 
56 
percent 
of 
rural 
3-5 
year 
old 
have 
access 
to 
pre-schooling, compared 
with 
67 
percent 
of 
urban 
children. 
Programs 
to 
promote 
early 
childhood 
stimulation, 
or 
initial 
education, 
for 
0-5 
year  old, 
through non-formal 
childcare 
and 
parent 
training, 
also have been demonstrated 
to 
be 
effective 
in 
promoting 
early 
brain 
development and 
avoiding 
malnutrition, 
stunting, 
and 
other problems among 
low-income 
and indigenous children, 
which 
can 
help 
equalize 
their 
future 
school 
success 
and 
life 
chances. 
Although 
some 
high 
quality 
NGO-run 
programs 
of 
this 
type exist 
in 
Peru, 
coverage 
is 
very 
limited. 
The 
Government 
has 
not 
yet 
developed 
an 
overall 
strategy 
for 
mainstreaming pre-school 
access 
in 
rural 
areas 
or 
supporting 
the 
delivery 
of 
non-formal 
initial 
education programs 
to 
target populations. 
Low 
secondary 
school 
coverage 
in 
rural 
areas. 
Secondary 
education 
in 
rural 
areas 
faces 
major 
challenges 
of 
both 
coverage 
and 
quality. 
The  net 
enrollment rate 
for 
education 
is 
only 
61 
percent 
in 
rural 
areas, 
compared 
with 
81 
percent 
in 
urban 
areas. 
Because 
there 
are 
very 
few 
secondary 
schools 
in 
rural 
areas, 
many 
families’ 
only 
option 
is 
to 
send 
their 
-7- 
Page  14
children 
to 
urban 
centers 
for 
schooling, 
which 
creates 
direct 
costs 
(lodging 
and 
travel) 
as 
well 
as 
opportunity 
costs, 
from 
the loss 
of 
children's 
informal 
labor. 
Girls, 
especially, suffer 
from 
this. 
However, 
Peru's 
extremely 
low 
population 
density and 
poor 
roads and 
transportation 
in 
most 
rural 
areas 
make 
expansion 
of 
secondary 
schooling 
using 
traditional 
face-to-face 
instructional 
models 
prohibitively 
expensive. 
Where 
secondary 
schools 
do 
exist, 
quality 
is 
usually 
lower 
than 
in 
urban 
schools, 
for 
many 
of 
the 
same 
reasons 
as 
observed 
at 
the 
primary 
level, 
in 
addition 
to 
the fact that frequently 
these 
schools 
are 
not 
able 
to hold 
sufficient 
number 
of 
qualified staff 
to 
deliver 
all 
the 
secondary 
education 
courses. 
Poor 
teacher 
quality and 
motivation. 
The 
formal 
level 
of 
qualifications 
of 
Peru's 
teaching force 
is 
very high, 
with 
some 
95 
percent 
of 
teachers 
holding 
tertiary 
education 
degrees. 
However, the 
average 
quality 
of 
Peruvian 
teachers 
is 
considered 
quite 
low 
(compared 
with 
other countries 
at 
similar 
levels 
of 
income), 
and 
motivation 
and 
performance 
are 
problematic, especially 
in 
rural 
areas. 
The clear 
underlying 
issues 
are: 
Mismatch 
between 
supply 
and 
demand. 
Despite unattractive 
pay, 
because 
of 
the unconditional, 
rigid 
stability 
attached 
to 
tenured 
status, 
there 
is 
a massive 
and 
growing 
oversupply 
of 
teachers: 
by 
late 
2001, 
some 
270,000  teachers 
were 
employed 
while 
another 
80,000 
had 
a 
title 
but 
no 
position. 
The 
teacher 
preparation system 
is 
producing 
between 
15,000 
and 
20,000 
graduates 
per 
year, 
against 
needs 
of 
4,000, 
and 
with 
the 
postponement 
of  the retirement 
age, 
more aging 
teachers 
will 
remain 
in 
activity. 
This 
notwithstanding, 
there 
are shortages 
in 
specific 
categories (pre-school, 
secondary, 
bilingual), 
disciplines 
(mathematics), 
and isolated 
areas. 
Unregulated, 
low 
quality pre-service 
preparation. 
About 
70 
percent 
of 
teachers 
holding 
tertiary 
degrees 
have 
been 
trained 
at 
universities, 
and 
30 
percent 
in 
one 
of 
the 
teacher 
training 
institutes 
(Higher Institutes 
of 
Pedagogy 
or 
ISPs). 
There 
are 
some 
53 
universities 
with 
faculties 
of 
education 
and 400 
ISPs, 
250 
of 
which 
are 
private. 
Due 
to 
the unregulated 
proliferation 
of 
low-quality training 
programs since 
1994, 
the 
number 
of 
formally 
qualified 
teachers 
has 
increased 
dramatically 
in 
recent 
years. 
However, 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
an 
accreditation 
system 
for 
teacher 
education 
programs, a 
similar 
title 
may 
hide 
very 
different 
levels 
of 
professional preparation. 
At 
universities, the 
intake 
into 
initial 
teacher 
education programs 
tends 
to 
be 
from 
the  poorest 
performing 
students, 
while 
at  ISPs, 
entry  requirements 
are 
generally 
low. 
Universities 
emphasize 
content over 
pedagogy, 
and 
ISPs, 
the 
opposite. 
In 
both 
types 
of 
institutions,  the 
curriculum 
is 
highly 
theoretical. 
With 
a 
few 
exceptions 
of 
an 
experimental  nature 
there 
is 
little 
grounding 
in 
classroom practice 
(no 
courses 
to 
prepare 
students 
for 
multigrade 
teaching, 
for 
example) 
and 
students 
have 
few 
systematic 
opportunities 
for 
internships 
in 
schools 
as 
student 
teachers, 
which 
is 
an 
essential 
part 
of 
training 
in 
most 
OECD 
countries. 
Only 
7 
percent 
of 
the 
ISP 
faculty 
have any graduate 
training 
and 
only 
18 
percent 
hold 
undergraduate-level 
degrees 
in 
any  content 
areas 
(mathematics, 
physics, 
history, 
language) 
besides pedagogic 
related 
courses. 
The  situation 
is 
hardly 
better 
in 
the 
universities. 
Low 
standards 
for 
entry 
into the 
profession. 
The 
disparities  and deficiencies 
in 
preparedness 
are 
not 
corrected 
at 
entry, 
as 
hiring 
is 
not 
based 
on 
formal 
teaching 
standards 
and 
rigorous 
procedures. 
Recruitment 
tests were 
introduced 
in 
1998, 
but 
these 
tests 
assessed 
teachers' 
conceptual knowledge; they 
were 
not 
criterion-based 
and 
did 
not 
evaluate 
pedagogical 
ability, 
methodological 
skills, 
interpersonal 
and 
team 
skills 
or 
community orientation. Since the 
18,000 
teacher 
training 
graduates 
currently 
being 
produced annually 
are 
well 
in 
excess 
of 
the 
Ministry's 
new 
hiring 
requirements, 
there 
exists considerable 
scope 
to 
elevate 
teacher standards. 
This 
could 
be achieved 
by 
introducing 
technically 
sound 
certification 
procedures 
prior 
to 
appointment, and 
periodic 
recertification 
to 
ensure 
the continuous 
maintenance and 
if 
possible, 
upgrading 
of 
teacher 
skills.

Low 
pay and inadequate 
incentives. 
The 
average teacher 
salary 
in 
Peru 
is 
approximately 
1.6 
times 
GDP 
per 
capita, 
to 
be compared 
to 
a 
multiple 
of 
2-4 times prevalent 
in 
similar 
countries. 
This 
is 
low, 
even 
after adjustment 
for 
average 
hours 
of 
work, 
which 
are 
less 
in 
Peru than 
in 
other 
LAC 
countries, 
and 
less 
for 
teachers 
than 
for 
other professions. 
As 
a 
result, 
some 
57 
percent 
of 
teachers 
have  taken 
up 
a 
second 
job, which 
has 
eroded the 
time 
they 
can 
dedicate 
to 
their 
school. 
The 
same 
nationwide 
salary schedule 
applies 
to 
secondary 
as 
well 
as 
primary 
teachers. 
It 
is 
quite 
compressed, 
with 
only 
a 
10 
percent 
differential 
in 
remuneration between the 
top 
and 
lowest 
grade 
for 
the 
same 
40 
hours work, 
compared 
with 
a 
good practice 
ratio 
of 
at 
least 
(5:l). 
The 
salary 
structure 
is 
fragmented and 
opaque, 
hardly 
designed 
to 
promote equity, 
generate 
motivation, 
or 
produce results. 
For 
instance, 
the 
“main 
element” 
of 
compensation 
amounts 
to only 
a 
tiny 
fraction 
of 
the total, 
the 
bulk 
of 
which 
is 
represented 
by 
the 
“general 
increment” 
created 
to 
compensate 
for 
inflation. 
There 
are 
bonuses 
for 
activities, 
such 
as 
lesson 
planning, 
which 
should 
form 
part 
of 
a 
teacher’s 
routine. 
Most 
importantly, 
the 
allocation 
for 
rural 
areas 
and 
hardship 
posts 
is 
not 
only 
insufficient, 
but 
portable, instead 
of 
being 
tied to 
the 
position. 
Even 
though the 
system-wide student 
to 
teacher 
ratio, 
a 
relatively 
low 
26: 
1 
at 
the 
primary 
level, 
suggests 
that 
the 
overall 
number 
of 
teachers 
is 
adequate, 
there 
is 
a 
clear 
distribution 
problem 
which 
results 
in 
a 
high 
share 
of 
schools 
in 
rural 
and 
low-income 
urban 
areas 
operating 
with 
teacher shortages. 
Duality 
of 
treatment 
between 
appointed  and  contracted  teachers. 
Some 
teachers 
have  permanent 
appointment 
status, 
others 
work 
under 
fixed 
term 
contracts. 
There 
is 
no 
relationship between 
teacher 
qualifications 
and 
employment 
status, 
although appointed 
teachers 
have 
enjoyed more 
generous 
benefits 
than their 
colleagues 
under 
fixed 
term 
contracts. 
This 
has 
been 
a 
source 
of 
demotivation and discontent. 
This 
duality 
of 
treatment 
needs 
to 
be 
corrected 
by 
gradually 
expanding the practice 
of 
open-ended 
contracts, 
making 
tenure 
conditional 
upon satisfactory performance 
to 
protect 
the 
right 
of 
each 
child to 
a 
competent 
and  committed 
teacher. 
Generally 
speaking, 
more 
efficient 
management 
of 
the 
maze 
of 
overlapping 
teacher 
categories 
would 
demand 
an 
upgraded Management 
Information 
System, 
with 
higher 
quality 
data and 
integrated 
data 
bases 
for monitoring 
and simulations. 
Poor 
teacher 
deployment 
and 
supervision. 
Teacher 
deployment 
is 
highly 
centralized 
and, 
although 
some 
30 
percent 
of 
teachers  have 
a 
mother tongue other 
than 
Spanish, 
the 
policy 
of 
deploying 
teachers 
geographically 
in 
line with 
their 
language 
skills, 
providing 
salary 
incentives 
for bilingual 
teaching, 
or 
ensuring  that 
at  least 
some 
experienced 
teachers  are 
sent 
to 
those 
isolated 
areas 
has 
not 
been 
appropriately  implemented. 
Teachers, 
especially 
in 
rural 
areas, 
receive 
little 
or 
no 
performance 
evaluation 
or 
support 
to 
improve 
their 
practice. 
Schools are 
seldom organized 
for 
learning, 
with 
emphasis 
on 
leadership, 
academic 
teamwork, 
resources 
in 
support 
of 
a 
shared 
vision, strong relations 
with 
parents. 
Visits 
from 
the 
local 
UGE 
are 
few 
and 
far 
between and 
career 
development plans and in-service 
training 
opportunities 
are 
limited, 
top-down, 
hardly 
related 
to 
the  perceived 
needs 
of 
teachers, 
and  seldom 
reinforced 
in-site. 
De 
facto, 
teachers 
face 
neither 
positive 
incentives 
for 
good performance 
nor 
the threat 
of 
sanctions 
for 
poor performance. 
Inefficient administration 
and 
low 
accountability 
for 
school 
performance. 
The  central 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
(MED) 
shares 
the 
responsibility 
for 
nationwide 
provision 
of 
educational 
services 
(from 
preschool 
to 
tertiary  non-university 
education) 
with 
24 
Regional Education 
Directorates 
(DRE), 
which 
vary considerably 
in 
terms 
of 
geographic 
size, 
school 
system development, 
and 
student 
populations, 
ranging 
from 
Lima, 
with 
over 
2.1 
million 
students, 
to 
Madre 
de 
Dios, 
with 
less 
than 
29,000 students. 
Each 
DRE: 
is 
headed 
by 
a 
director. 
Between 
the 
DREs 
and the school 
level 
are 
268 
sub-regional 
offices 
called: Educational Management 
Units 
(UGEs), 
which 
are 
administrative oversight 
offices 
some 
of 
which 
have 
budgetary authority.

There 
are 
four 
clear 
issues 
with 
the 
current 
system. 
First, 
analysts 
concur 
in 
labeling 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
as 
heavily 
centralized 
and 
inefficient. 
A 
high-level 
commission 
was 
tasked 
with 
developing 
a 
national decentralization 
plan 
by 
end-2002 
affecting 
all 
sectors 
of 
Government. 
The 
current 
reality 
is 
that 
top-down 
initiatives 
emanate 
regularly 
from 
the 
central 
level 
with little 
concern 
for 
prioritization, 
avoiding duplication, 
and 
the 
difficulties 
of 
administering 
cascading 
requests 
for 
information 
or 
action 
at 
the 
regional,  sub-regional 
and 
school levels. 
At 
the 
Directorate 
level, 
there 
is 
little 
autonomy 
and 
accountability 
for 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
schools 
in 
their 
region. 
Data 
on 
school performance 
and 
student 
learning 
are 
not 
organized 
and 
monitored 
at 
the 
DRE 
level,  and 
DREs 
are 
neither 
rewarded 
nor 
sanctioned 
for 
their 
progress 
in 
improving 
educational indicators over time. 
Although 
some 
DREs 
are 
apparently 
more  innovative 
and 
effective 
than 
others, 
the 
Ministry 
appears 
to 
lack 
instruments 
for 
disseminating 
effective 
approaches 
or 
intervening 
where 
failure 
is 
persistent. 
Second, 
there 
are 
clear problems 
at 
the 
UGE 
level, 
which 
is 
marked 
by 
confusing 
geographic and 
functional 
demarcation of responsibilities, 
inadequate 
staffing 
and equipment 
for 
their 
missions, 
and 
low 
value 
added 
to 
schools. 
The 
Ministry 
recognizes 
that, 
particularly 
in 
rural 
settings, 
the 
sub-regional 
offices 
have 
generally 
been 
ineffective 
in 
reaching the 
schools, 
and 
often 
characterized 
by 
a 
bureaucratic 
and 
punitive 
orientation,  rather 
than 
seeing themselves 
as 
a 
source 
of 
support. 
The 
third 
and most 
important 
issue 
is 
that, system-wide, 
there 
is 
a 
lack 
of 
focus on the school level. Peru 
is 
one 
of 
the 
few 
countries 
in 
Latin 
America 
that 
has 
not 
yet 
put 
in 
place 
a standardized 
system 
of 
student 
assessment 
to 
track learning 
outcomes. 
Although 
sample-based 
assessments 
were 
undertaken 
in 
1996 
and 
1998, 
they  were 
not 
standardized 
so 
as 
to 
permit 
comparison 
of 
the 
results 
over  time. 
A 
new 
standardized 
assessment  was 
administered 
in 
November 
2001, 
again 
on 
a 
sample  basis. 
As 
a 
consequence, 
schools 
receive 
no 
regular 
information 
about 
how 
their 
student 
learning 
performance 
- 
or 
other 
education indicators 
such 
as 
graduation, 
repetition, dropout 
rates. 
Finally, 
there have 
been 
some 
incipient 
attempts 
to 
encourage 
school-level development planning, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
undertaken systematically. 
Plans 
where they 
exist 
are 
not 
resourced, 
and there 
are 
no 
instruments 
for 
holding 
schools accountable 
for 
implementing 
proposed improvements. 
More 
fundamentally, 
schools 
have 
no 
budgetary 
autonomy, and cannot even undertake 
minor 
purchases 
or 
repairs. 
Parents are 
invited 
to 
serve 
on 
parent-teacher 
bodies (APAFAs), 
but 
these 
have 
no 
formal 
role 
in 
school personnel 
or 
other 
decisions 
and 
many operate 
only 
perfunctorily. 
In 
short, 
in 
contrast 
to 
the 
growing 
number 
of 
Latin 
American countries 
which 
are 
strengthening budgetary and decision-making 
capacity, and 
accountability 
for 
results 
at 
the 
school 
level  while 
simultaneously  strengthening 
key 
normative 
and 
assessment 
functions 
at 
the 
Ministry 
(or 
system) 
level, the education system 
in 
Peru remains 
quite 
centralized 
and 
the 
focus 
on school 
level 
results 
is 
weak. 
Government Strategy: 
The Government 
of 
Peru launched 
an 
effort 
of 
bringing 
together  representatives 
from 
political, religious 
civil 
society 
and government 
organizations 
in 
order 
to 
agree 
on 
key 
State 
policies. 
The 
result 
was 
the 
National 
Agreement 
which 
enumerates 
a 
set 
of 
policies leading 
to 
four main 
objectives: Democracy 
and a 
Rights 
Based 
State, 
Equity 
and 
Social 
Justice, 
Competitiveness,  and 
a 
Efficient, 
Transparent 
and 
Decentralized 
State. 
Under 
the 
second 
objective, the 
key 
Policy 
provides 
for 
Universal 
Access 
to 
a Free 
Quality 
Public 
Education and 
Promotion 
and 
Defense 
of 
Culture 
and 
Sports. 
Specific policies 
under 
this 
major 
one, 
include 
Early 
Childhood 
Development, 
Rural 
Education, 
Teacher 
Development, 
and 
Strengthening 
the 
Quality 
and 
Relevance 
of 
Basic Education through 
greater 
school autonomy. 
The 
Education 
Sector 
has 
published Education 
Policy 
Guidelines 
which 
are 
aligned 
with 
the Education 
Policy 
stated 
in 
the 
National 
Agreement. 
Key 
actions 
identified 
to 
achieve the 
Education 
Sector 
Policies 
are: 
- 
10- 
Page  17
Increased 
focus 
on 
the 
needs 
of 
students 
and 
schools. 
Two 
actions 
are 
called 
for 
under 
this 
objective: 
to 
strengthen 
the 
curriculum 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
values 
and 
citizenship 
and 
to 
make 
school 
management 
more 
democratic, 
by 
creating school councils 
that 
promote accountability 
at 
the 
local 
level. 
In 
2001 
the 
GOP 
issued 
a 
Supreme 
Decree 
instituting 
voluntary  school councils. 
Later 
on, 
in 
February 
2002, 
MED 
established school councils 
as 
compulsory 
and 
network 
councils 
were 
deemed necessary. 
Although 
the 
creation 
of 
these 
school 
councils 
is 
an 
important 
step 
towards  increased school 
autonomy 
with 
accountability, 
a 
number 
of 
issues 
remain 
to 
be 
addressed 
to 
ensure 
their 
successful 
implementation, 
including 
(a) 
outreach 
and 
promotion efforts 
to 
make 
community 
members 
aware 
of 
this 
reform; 
(b) 
training 
of 
council 
members 
on 
their 
roles and responsibilities; 
(c) 
restructuring 
of 
MED’s 
regional 
offices, 
to 
provide 
support 
to 
schools 
in 
this 
new 
strategy; 
and 
(d) 
creating incentives 
for 
schools 
to 
create 
the  school councils. 
To 
address 
these 
issues, 
MED 
is 
currently 
developing 
a 
new proposed 
structure and roles 
of 
the 
regional 
offices 
and 
preparing 
to 
launch 
a 
communications program 
to 
promote 
the 
formation 
of 
school 
councils. 
A 
more democratic 
and 
accountable education 
management system 
This 
strategic 
objective calls 
for 
the 
reorganization 
of 
the 
ME;D 
regional 
offices 
in 
order 
to 
reduce 
bureaucracy, 
focus the 
system 
on 
school 
performance 
and increase transparency 
and 
accountability 
at 
all 
levels. 
MED 
is 
pursuing the 
following 
5 
lines 
of 
actions 
toward 
this 
objective: 
(a) 
restructuring the 
regional offices 
to 
address 
corruption 
and 
inefficiency 
problems, 
and 
to 
prepare 
the 
system 
for 
greater 
regional 
autonomy; 
(b) 
continued 
application 
of 
sample-based 
national 
assessments 
and 
publication 
of 
results. 
While 
the 1996 
and 
1998 
tests 
were norm-based and 
limited 
to mainly 
urban 
areas, 
the 2001 
test 
was 
criterion-based 
and 
covered 
also 
rural 
areas 
and 
Quechua 
and 
Aymara 
speaking 
students; 
(c) 
publication 
of 
the results 
of 
the 
National 
Consultation  on 
Education, 
which 
was 
carried 
out 
during 
the 
Transition 
Government 
(January-July 
2001); 
(d) 
creation 
of 
an 
National 
Council 
on Education 
with 
membership 
of 
a 
wide 
variety 
of 
citizen 
groups; 
and, 
(e) 
installation 
of 
a 
new complaints 
hotline 
and center. 
Expand  and  improve  the  quality 
of 
the  education 
services 
in 
rural 
areas. 
Eleven 
of 
Peru’s 
24 
Departments 
have 
been 
targeted 
for 
expanded investment, 
in 
order 
to 
bring 
the 
currently 
low 
ECD 
and 
pre-school participation, 
primary 
school 
completion 
and 
secondary 
school completion 
rates 
in 
these 
impoverished 
rural 
areas 
up 
to 
the 
national 
average. 
Priority 
investments 
include 
(a) 
expanding, 
strengthening 
and 
improving 
the 
quality 
of ECD 
and pre-school 
education, 
including 
universal 
coverage 
of 
5-year 
old 
in 
pre-school, 
(b) 
strengthening 
primary 
education 
quality 
and 
expanding 
intercultural 
bilingual 
education, and 
(c) 
implementing 
a 
new 
model 
for 
secondary 
schooling 
in 
rural 
areas, 
using 
information 
and communication technologies 
(“Plan 
Huascariin”).  The 
MED 
has 
also 
initiated 
a 
pilot 
program 
to 
provide 
incentives 
to 
teachers 
in 
rural 
areas 
with 
the specific 
objective 
of 
ensuring 
quality 
teachers 
in 
rural 
schools. 
MED 
is 
committed 
not only 
to 
implement 
this 
first 
phase 
of 
the 
incentive 
system 
but 
also 
to 
pursue a 
longer 
term 
strategy 
of 
improving 
the 
quality 
of 
teachers 
(see 
below). 
Include substantial 
indigenous 
participation in 
rural 
education. 
Approximately 
one 
third 
of 
the 
national 
population 
are 
indigenous 
and 
speak 
one 
of 
Peru’s 
42 
native 
languages. 
To 
respond 
to 
these 
needs, 
the 
Government 
strategy 
involves 
strengthening indigenous 
community participation 
in 
various 
aspects 
of 
project 
implementation, 
as 
well 
as 
addressing 
the  basic  educational 
needs 
of 
indigenous 
learners, 
regarding 
the 
use 
of 
indigenous 
languages 
in 
basic education along 
with 
the teaching 
and 
learning 
of 
Spanish 
as 
a 
second language. 
Further 
measures 
to 
assure 
quality 
educational improvement 
in 
rural 
areas 
include 
indigenous 
teacher 
training 
and 
employment, 
community 
outreach  and 
revision 
of 
school 
calendars 
to 
respond 
to 
the 
local 
agricultural 
cycle.

Reform 
the teacher quality 
assurance 
system, 
career 
path 
and 
incentives, 
through dialogue 
with 
the 
teachers’ 
unions, 
setting 
standards 
to 
upgrade 
quality 
and 
reduce 
the 
variance 
in 
teacher 
preparation 
and 
performance, 
implementing 
a 
continuous 
teacher 
professional  development 
system, 
designing 
an 
incentives 
policy 
which 
supports what 
makes 
a 
difference 
for 
children 
learning, 
and 
introducing 
a 
growth-oriented evaluation system 
As 
a 
first 
step, 
MED 
has 
produced 
a 
study, 
which 
develops the basic 
principles 
for 
the  reform, 
including 
criterion-referenced 
standards 
as 
a  basis 
for 
the 
certification, 
selection, 
promotion 
of 
teachers 
in 
the 
sector, 
proposals 
for 
an 
accreditation 
system 
for 
teacher 
training 
institutions, 
for 
a 
streamlined 
salary  structure, 
more 
efficient 
payment 
mechanism, 
and 
more 
differentiated 
incentives 
and 
sanctions. 
In 
February 
2002, 
the 
MED 
introduced new 
criteria 
for 
teacher 
recruitment 
as 
part 
of 
the 
reform. 
Teachers 
considered 
for 
conversion 
from fixed 
term 
to 
open-ended 
contracts 
were 
evaluated through 
an 
objective 
test 
and 
interview 
process 
that 
included 
the 
participation 
of 
parents 
and, 
when 
relevant, 
indigenous 
organizations, 
who 
had 
the 
right 
to 
veto 
teachers 
if 
there were 
unable 
to 
show 
proper 
use 
of 
the 
local 
language. 
While 
this 
was 
a 
clear 
step 
in 
the 
right 
direction, 
the 
test 
scores 
registered 
by 
the 
candidates (the median 
score 
was 
11 
out 
of 
40 
possible points) 
confirmed 
the 
serious 
issues 
of 
teachers’ 
low 
cognitive 
and 
professional 
competencies. 
Approximately 
22,000 
teachers 
have 
now 
been 
converted 
to 
open 
ended contracts. 
There 
is 
also a 
clear 
need 
for 
continuous, and 
more 
effective, professional 
development programs 
for 
teachers 
if 
their 
quality 
is 
to 
be 
upgraded. 
Evaluating 
Progress. 
The 
GOP 
has 
identified 
three 
key 
medium 
term 
indicators 
to 
measure 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
strategy: 
(a) 
proportion 
of 
children who 
are 
in 
the 
normative 
age 
for 
each 
grade, 
(b) 
proportion 
of 
children 
that complete 
primary 
and 
secondary 
education 
in 
11 
years, 
and 
(c) 
proportion 
of 
children 
that 
approve 
the 
standard 
performance evaluation.  Each 
of 
the 
above 
strategic 
objectives 
will 
contribute 
to 
the 
achievement 
of 
all 
these 
indicators, 
by 
ensuring that 
children 
attend 
schools and 
that 
their education 
is 
more 
relevant 
to 
their 
needs, 
making 
schools 
more accountable 
for 
their 
performance, 
ensuring targeted interventions 
in 
previously 
excluded 
areas 
in 
terms 
of 
coverage and 
quality 
of 
education, and 
improving 
the 
quality 
of 
teachers, 
a 
key 
and 
previously 
underemphasized 
input 
to 
the 
quality 
of 
education. 
3. 
Sector 
issues 
to 
be 
addressed 
by 
the 
project 
and 
strategic 
choices: 
The  Program 
is 
focused 
on 
the  most 
important 
strategic 
issues 
in 
the education 
sector 
and 
on 
the 
development 
of 
the 
most 
cost-effective investment 
strategies, 
particularly 
for 
secondary 
school expansion 
in 
rural 
areas. 
The 
Program 
will 
encourage 
the 
pursuit 
and deepening 
of 
recently launched reforms 
of 
teacher 
quality 
and system 
management 
and 
will 
support 
investments 
to 
expand 
and 
improve 
rural 
education. 
The proposed 
APL 
will 
complement 
a 
Programmatic 
Social 
Reform 
Loan 
(PSRL) 
which 
is 
currently 
strengthening 
the 
reform 
dialogue 
across 
most 
of 
the 
social 
sectors. 
The 
PSRL 
ensures 
that 
policy 
decision 
makers 
at 
the 
macroeconomic 
level 
become 
actively 
involved 
in 
the decisions 
being 
sought 
in 
the 
social 
sectors. 
The  education 
benchmarks 
in 
the 
PSRL 
will 
be 
implemented, 
in 
part, 
with 
the 
financing 
of 
this 
APL.

Three 
major 
issues 
will 
be 
addressed: 
I 
Sector 
Issue 
a) 
Low

 r 
itrategic 
Choices 
The  Project 
will 
support 
the  expansion 
of 
initial 
formal 
education 
classes 
(3-5 
year 
old) 
to 
respond 
to 
local 
population 
needs. 
Non-formal 
(PRONOEI) 
interventions 
will 
be expanded 
and strengthened 
in 
areas 
where 
populations 
are 
more 
dispersed 
and 
do 
not 
justify 
regular 
Initial 
Education 
Schools. 
Where 
populations 
are 
very dispersed 
and 
to 
cover 
younger 
children, 
non-formal, household 
centered 
programs 
will 
be 
supported. 
The 
Project 
will 
support 
the development and 
assessment 
of 
: 
distance 
education program 
to 
be implemented 
as 
a 
pilot 
durinl 
the 
first 
Dhase 
of 
the 
APL. 
The Project 
will 
support 
the design and implementation 
of 
a 
new 
system 
of 
continuous professional development 
for 
rural 
teachers. 
Emphasis 
will 
be 
on 
multigrade 
and 
bilingual 
teaching 
skills 
and teacher 
support 
networks. 
Teachers 
will 
also 
be deployed 
in 
line 
with 
their 
ability 
to 
teach 
in 
local 
languages. 
Teachers 
will 
receive 
salary and 
housing incentives 
adequate 
to 
attract and 
retain 
them 
in 
remote 
rural 
areas. 
The 
Project 
will 
support 
adaptation 
of 
the 
curriculum to 
multigrade 
and 
bilingual 
environments and 
will 
ensure 
timely 
distribution 
of 
adequate 
quantities 
of 
new 
instructional 
materials 
in 
rural 
areas 
to 
support 
multigrade 
classes 
and 
bilingual 
education. 
The Project 
will 
assist 
MED 
in 
setting 
up 
self-administered 
a 
census-based 
student 
performance 
testing 
system 
with 
provision 
of 
feedback 
to 
schools 
within 
the 
intervention 
area. 
Regional 
offices 
will 
be restructured 
under 
a 
decentralization 
strategy and focused 
on 
providing 
assistance 
to 
schools. 
Small 
rural 
schools 
will 
be 
linked 
into 
networks 
for 
coordinated 
planning, 
experience 
sharing and training. 
School-level 
autonomy and 
community voice 
will 
be 
fostered 
by 
the 
establishment 
of 
school 
councils 
and 
support 
for 
school 
development plans. 
Also, 
network 
- 
level 
councils 
will 
be 
established 
with 
communal, 
and, 
where 
relevant, indigenous 
organizations 
participation 
in 
order 
to 
foster 
project 
ownership 
among 
stakeholders. 
The Project 
will 
support 
the design 
and 
implementation 
of 
a 
new 
teacher career 
plan 
which 
will 
include 
teacher standards 
and 
certification, 
and 
a 
new 
salary 
scale 
(including 
incentives 
to work 
in 
rural 
areas 
and 
in 
bilingual 
schools). 
A 
new 
system 
of 
accreditation 
for 
teacher 
training 
institutes 
will 
also 
contribute 
to 
higher 
teacher 
quality.

Program 
description and performance triggers 
for 
subsequent 
loans: 
Program 
Description: 
The Project 
will 
help 
the 
Peruvian 
government 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
basic 
education 
in 
the 
country 
by 
reducing 
inequities 
between 
rural 
and 
urban 
areas. 
The Project's 
main 
goal 
is 
to 
raise 
the 
achievement 
of 
competencies 
of 
schoolchildren 
in 
rural 
areas, 
from 
preschool 
to 
Grade 
11. 
The program 
would 
be 
implemented through 
a 
three-phase approach 
during 
a 
10-year 
period. 
Phase 
I 
would allow 
learning 
from 
the development and 
piloting 
implementation 
of 
the 
program. 
Based 
on 
an 
evaluation 
of 
the 
introductory 
and 
piloting 
experience 
gathered 
from 
Phase 
I, 
Phase 
II 
would modify 
and 
expectedly expand 
the 
rural 
education 
program,  and 
strengthen 
nationwide  the  human 
resource and 
continuous 
teacher 
training 
system. 
Finally, 
after 
careful 
assessment 
of 
previous 
experiences 
and 
investments, 
the 
Phase 
III 
would 
add new dimensions 
to 
the 
rural 
education 
program, 
including 
nationwide 
expansion 
of 
the 
initial, 
primary, 
and 
secondary 
education 
programs, 
and 
would 
continue 
with 
the support 
and 
adjustments 
of 
the 
continuous 
teacher 
training 
system and 
the 
teacher 
policy 
as 
needed.

Program 
and 
Project Description Summary 
1. 
Project 
components 
(see 
Annex 
2 
for 
a 
detailed description 
and 
Annex 
3 
for 
a 
detailed 
cost 
breakdown): 
Component 
1: 
Expanding 
Education 
Access 
for 
Rural 
Children 
(US$10.54 
million, 
11 
percent 
of 
total Project 
cost) 
The key objective 
of 
this 
component 
is 
to 
increase 
access 
to 
quality 
initial, 
pre-school 
and 
secondary 
education 
for 
children 
in 
rural 
areas 
who have 
been 
previously 
excluded 
from 
these services. 
Access 
to 
Quality 
Initial 
and 
Preschool 
Education 
Two 
distinct children 
groups 
are addressed 
under 
this 
component: 
(a) 
the 
0 
through 
2-year-old 
children 
participating 
in 
Initial 
Education  programs focused 
on 
increasingly 
complex  activities 
designed 
to 
promote 
a balanced 
early 
childhood 
development (ECD). 
In 
spite 
of 
pioneering 
ECD 
initiatives 
in 
the 
1960s, 
Peru 
shows 
today a 
surprisingly 
low 
coverage 
rate (around 
3 
percent nationwide, 
and 
1 
percent 
in 
rural 
areas) 
for 
this 
age 
group;  and 
(b) 
the 
3-5 
year-old group 
being 
prepared 
(at 
pre-school) 
for 
the 
adequate 
and 
timely 
readiness 
for 
entry 
to 
formal primary 
schooling. Peru 
has 
reached a 
national 42 
percent 
coverage 
rate 
(36 
percent 
in 
rural 
areas) 
for 
this 
age 
group, 
through 
the development 
of 
the 
Non-formal 
Initial 
Education Program (PRONOEI) 
and 
the 
Initial 
Education 
Centers 
(CEI). 
For 
children 
0-2 
years 
old, 
a 
non-formal 
approach 
will 
be 
implemented 
in 
which 
children 
will 
be 
educated 
along 
with 
their 
parents 
and 
siblings 
within 
a 
family 
and 
community 
framework. 
Services 
will 
be 
delivered 
by 
trained 
community 
educators 
(animadorus) 
through 
home-based  and  center-based 
strategies. 
Wherever 
relevant, community 
educators 
fluent 
in 
the 
local 
vernacular 
languages 
will 
be 
trained 
for 
the 
provision 
of 
Initial 
Education. 
It 
is 
expected that 
30,000 
children 
will 
benefit 
from 
this 
program, 
amounting 
to 
a coverage 
from 
1 
percent 
to 
4.7 
percent. 
-15- 
Page  22
For 
children 
3-5 
years old, 
an 
intervention combining 
of 
formal 
and 
non-formal 
approaches 
will 
be 
implemented. 
Wherever relevant, community 
educators 
fluent 
in 
the 
local 
vernacular 
languages 
will 
be 
trained 
for 
the 
provision 
of 
initial 
education and 
the 
introduction 
of 
children 
to 
Spanish. 
Services 
will 
be 
implemented 
by 
trained 
animadoras, 
teachers 
and 
teaching  coordinators  and  sub-central 
office 
specialists. 
The 
CEI 
and 
PRONOEI 
program 
will 
be 
strengthened, 
and 
300 
new 
PRONOEIs 
will 
be 
created. 
A 
total 
of 
38,000 
children 
3-5 
year 
old 
are 
expected 
to 
benefit 
from 
the Project, 
of 
which 
29 
percent (or 
1 
1,000) 
would 
result 
from 
Project-expanded 
coverage. 
Secondary 
Education 
Secondary 
education 
is 
compulsory 
and 
has 
become 
part 
of 
the basic education 
structure, together 
with 
preschool 
and 
primary. 
In 
rural 
areas, 
however, 
access 
to 
post-primary  schooling, 
even 
the 
five-year 
basic 
secondary 
education, 
is 
made 
particularly 
difficult, 
especially 
for 
those groups 
who 
have 
to 
face 
either 
geographic 
constraints 
in 
the 
Andean 
mountains or 
sheer 
remoteness 
in 
the 
Amazon forest. 
Any 
impact-oriented 
solution 
must 
identify 
creative 
strategies 
other  than 
traditional 
school 
delivery. 
In 
selected 
rural 
areas, 
the 
Project 
will 
develop 
distance 
secondary 
education 
programs 
through  the 
application 
of 
cost-effective 
information 
and 
communication 
technologies. 
For 
the 
Phase 
I, 
a coverage 
of 
5,000 
students 
is 
planned, a 
14 
percent increase 
in 
coverage 
as 
compared 
to 
the 
2002 
rates 
in 
the 
pilot 
areas. Phase 
I 
will 
pilot 
and 
assess 
two 
models 
using 
varying 
levels 
of 
information 
and 
communication 
technologies. 
The focus 
will 
be 
on testing 
and 
gauging 
two 
secondary 
education models 
in 
order 
to 
determine 
the cost-effective solutions 
that 
better 
fit 
each 
particular 
rural 
environment 
of 
Peru. 
The 
pilot 
will 
be 
implemented gradually 
during 
the 
three 
year 
period 
up 
to 
a 
total 
of 
116 
schools 
which 
will 
be 
located 
at 
the center 
of 
the 
rural 
networks 
which 
do 
not 
have a 
secondary 
school 
currently 
available. 
It 
is 
expected that 
facilities 
will 
also 
be 
used 
for 
teacher 
training 
and, 
possibly, enrichment 
of 
upper 
primary 
students. 
Component 
2: 
Improving 
Quality 
in 
Rural 
Primary 
Schools 
(US$63.58 
million, 
68 
percent 
of 
total 
Project 
cost) 
This 
component 
focuses 
on 
the 
quality 
of 
teaching 
and 
learning 
in 
primary 
schools 
in 
the targeted 
rural 
areas. 
It 
will 
support 
quality 
improvement through 
three 
sub-components: 
(a) 
a 
program 
of 
continuous 
professional 
development 
with 
a 
focus  on 
rural 
teachers; 
(b) 
the  development 
and 
distribution 
of 
multigrade 
and 
bilingual 
instructional 
materials; and 
(c) 
classroom 
rehabilitation 
and 
equipping. 
Continuous 
Teacher Development 
System 
(CTDS) 
This 
sub-component 
will 
upgrade 
both 
initial 
and 
in-service 
teachers' 
educational 
and 
professional 
quality 
and 
performance through: 
(a) 
the 
design 
of 
a 
continuous 
teacher 
training 
system based 
on 
a 
redefined 
pre-service 
and 
a 
decentralized 
and consistent 
in-service 
teacher 
training 
strategy; 
and 
(b) 
the 
training 
of 
the 
initial, 
primary 
and 
secondary 
school 
teachers 
required 
for 
adequate 
project 
implementation 
in 
the 
target 
Project 
areas. 
With 
respect 
to initial 
teacher 
training, the 
sub-component 
would 
support the 
design 
and 
introduction 
of 
a 
continuous  two-phase 
(pre- 
and 
in-service) 
teacher 
development 
system 
that 
will: 
(a) 
redefine 
the 
pre-service 
teacher 
training; 
(b) 
set 
up 
an 
ISP 
accreditation 
system; 
(c) 
offer 
specialized 
training to 
600 
teachers 
trainers; and 
(d) 
implement 
15 
competitive 
innovation projects 
at 
the 
ISP 
level. 
With 
respect 
to 
in-service  programs 
the 
sub-component 
will 
(a) 
support 
six  new regional 
"Amauta" 
Teachers 
Professional Development 
Centers 
(linked 
to 
DINFOCAD); 
(b) 
coordinate 
and 
hire 
external

training institutions 
to 
provide training 
to 
19,800 
rural 
teachers, 3,400 
ECD 
and 
PRONOEI 
animadoras 
and 
250 
secondary 
education  tutors; 
and  (c) 
develop 
a 
social  marketing 
plan 
to 
promote 
teacher 
appreciation 
and 
motivation. 
Curriculum 
Adjustment 
and Provision 
of 
Educational 
Materials 
This 
sub-component 
seeks 
to 
contribute 
to quality 
improvement 
of 
rural 
primary 
schooling, 
including 
areas 
in 
which 
one 
or  more indigenous 
languages are 
predominantly 
spoken. 
Two 
complementary 
models 
will 
be 
implemented: 
(a) 
delivery  at  the 
national 
level 
of 
already 
experimented 
bilingual 
educational materials 
prepared 
by 
the 
MED; 
and 
(b) 
the 
design 
and 
validation 
within 
the networks 
selected 
for 
this 
project 
of 
a 
new educational proposal 
for 
the 
rural 
areas, 
aiming 
at 
more 
pertinent 
pedagogical 
service, 
through 
high 
quality 
self-paced 
learning 
strategies, 
materials, 
and 
teacher 
manuals 
to 
support 
multigrade instruction 
and 
bilingual 
education. 
In 
both 
cases, 
rural 
indigenous vernacular 
and 
Spanish-speaking 
children 
will 
be 
benefited 
by 
the project. 
Teacher 
training  activities 
will 
also 
be 
included 
in 
both 
modalities. 
For 
indigenous 
vernacular-speaking 
students, 
the  sub-component 
includes 
support 
to 
primary 
school 
students 
belonging 
to 
14 
different 
indigenous 
groups, 
at 
the 
national 
level, through the implementation 
of 
the 
education program 
in 
their 
respective 
mother 
tongues 
and 
the 
teaching 
of 
Spanish 
as 
a 
second 
language. 
Within 
the 
scope 
of 
the Project, 
the 
following 
materials 
will 
be 
distributed: 
(a) 
previously 
validated workbooks 
(three 
per 
student) 
in 
language 
and communication 
for 
the 
indigenous 
languages, 
Spanish 
as 
a 
second  language 
and 
mathematics 
for 
the  six 
grades 
of 
primary 
education; 
(b) 
corresponding 
teachers 
guides;  (c) 
bilingual 
classroom 
libraries 
(1 
8,000); 
and 
(d) 
sets 
of 
complementary 
educational materials. 
During 
Phase 
I, 
approximately 
15,000 
teachers 
working 
with 
375,000 
children 
will 
be 
trained 
in 
the 
use 
of 
these 
materials 
as 
part 
of 
the 
full 
training 
program 
offered 
to 
bilingual 
teachers. 
It 
is 
estimated 
that  through 
these 
activities 
69 
percent 
of 
the 
vernacular-speaking indigenous 
rural 
population 
at 
primary level 
will 
be 
covered. 
Rehabilitation 
and Equipping 
of 
Rural 
Schools 
In 
this 
Phase 
I, 
this 
sub-component 
will 
finance 
civil 
works, 
furniture 
and equipment 
in 
order 
to 
refurbish 
classrooms and other 
educational 
and 
administrative 
spaces, 
benefiting 
35,000 
children 
in 
540 
schools 
located 
in 
poor 
rural 
areas 
of 
the  three 
climatic 
regions 
of 
Peru; 
these 
schools 
make 
up 
116 
primary-school networks 
in 
11 
Departments 
of 
the country.  The Project 
would 
target 
the refurbishment 
of 
up 
to 
1,900 
classrooms 
and 
approximately 
1,500 
complementary 
facilities 
(such 
as 
administrative 
offices, 
small cooking 
facilities, 
sanitary 
services, 
etc) 
in 
existing 
schools 
according 
to 
architectural 
prototypes 
agreed 
with 
the 
Bank. 
The Compensation 
and 
Social Development 
Fund 
(FONCODES) 
will 
be 
the 
executing 
agency 
for 
all 
construction work. 
During 
appraisal, the 
Project cycle 
to 
be 
followed 
was 
reviewed 
and agreed upon. 
MED, 
through 
the 
Education Infrastructure 
Office 
(Om), 
will 
perform 
random inspection 
of 
works. 
The 
MED 
PCU 
will 
carry  out 
the 
general 
coordination 
and 
the 
furnishing 
and 
equipment 
of 
the 
completed  infrastructure, 
in 
close 
coordination 
with 
FONCODES. 
This 
sub-component 
will 
be 
co-financed 
by 
the 
IDB 
through 
its 
FONCODES 
IIt 
Project. 
The  preventive 
maintenance 
program 
for 
all 
infrastructure 
considered 
during 
this 
Phase 
I 
will 
be 
implemented 
directly 
by 
the 
schools 
through the 
local 
Parenneacher 
Associations 
with 
funds 
provided 
by 
MED 
at 
an expected 
annual rate 
of 
US$lOO/classroom.

Component 
3: 
Reform 
of 
Teacher Policy 
and 
Education 
Management 
(US$20.08 
million, 
21 
percent 
of 
total 
project 
cost) 
Systemic 
reforms 
of 
teacher 
policy 
and 
education 
management 
are 
crucial 
for 
improving 
the 
quality 
of 
basic 
education 
and 
the 
efficiency 
of 
education 
spending. 
A 
key 
objective 
of 
the 
proposed program 
is 
to 
support 
the 
new 
Government’s 
efforts 
to 
address 
politically 
sensitive 
issues 
in 
these 
areas 
that have 
been 
among the most 
important constraints 
to 
educational 
progress 
in 
Peru. 
The 
reforms 
of 
teacher 
policy 
and 
education 
management 
will 
be 
national 
and 
will 
have 
considerable 
implications 
for 
rural 
schools, 
which 
have 
suffered 
the most 
from: 
(a) 
teacher 
low 
quality, 
and 
motivation 
linked 
to 
inadequate 
standards 
and 
incentives; 
and 
(b) 
a 
centralized 
system 
of 
education 
management 
that 
has 
failed 
to 
monitor 
and support 
rural 
schools. 
This 
component 
has 
six inter-related 
sub-components: 
(a) 
teacher 
policy 
reform; 
(b) 
reform 
of 
education 
management; 
(c) 
support 
for 
school 
development; 
(d) 
national 
assessment 
system; 
(e) 
strategic analysis 
and 
policy 
research: 
and 
(f) 
Project 
management. 
Teacher 
Policy 
Reform 
The 
purpose 
of 
this 
sub-component 
would 
be 
to 
support 
MED 
efforts 
in 
developing 
and 
implementing 
a 
standard-based teacher career 
and development 
reform 
relying 
on 
a 
professional performance evaluation 
mechanism, 
a 
certification 
system, 
and 
remuneration 
and 
recognition 
instruments. Specifically, 
the 
Project 
would 
finance: 
(a) 
the 
design 
and 
implementation 
of 
the 
teacher 
career 
and development 
system, 
including: 
(i) 
a 
detailed structure 
of 
the 
teaching 
career 
ladder, 
its 
performance and 
experience 
levels 
and 
corresponding 
promotion 
criteria; 
(ii) 
a  systematic 
teaching  performance  evaluation 
covering 
the 
multidimensional intra- 
and 
extra-classroom roles 
played 
by 
teachers 
in 
their 
daily 
educational activities; 
(iii) 
a 
teacher’s 
initial 
certification 
of 
professional quality,  and 
periodic  re-certification 
system. 
The 
re-certification 
process 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
initially 
on 
a 
voluntary 
basis, 
and 
later 
shifted 
to 
compulsory 
status; 
(iv) 
the established 
scenarios 
for 
the 
remuneration 
package and 
other forms 
of 
incentives 
and 
recognition; 
(b) 
the 
development 
and dissemination 
of 
guidelines, operating 
manuals, 
software 
and 
other 
instruments 
to 
share 
with 
all 
teachers 
and 
managers 
information 
on the 
benefits 
legally 
guaranteed 
and 
conditions 
set 
by 
the 
teacher 
development 
system; 
(c) 
the upgrading 
of 
the 
teacher 
MIS 
(Management 
Information 
System) 
to 
support 
information-based 
teacher management 
and deployment. The 
MIS 
will 
maintain 
an 
updated 
data 
bank 
of 
the professional 
training 
and development 
status 
of 
every  single 
teacher, 
starting 
with 
those 
involved 
with 
the 
290 
proposed school networks. 
This 
information 
system 
will 
become 
a 
sine 
qua 
non condition 
for 
the 
adequate 
operation 
of 
the Continuous 
Teacher 
Training 
System; and 
(d) 
the implementation 
of 
several 
national 
and 
local 
workshops 
to 
inform 
teachers 
and 
other 
members 
of 
the 
education 
community 
of 
the 
forthcoming 
changes. 
Reform 
of 
education 
management 
This 
sub-component 
will 
support  the  Government’s 
efforts 
to 
“invert 
the 
pyramid” 
of 
education 
administration 
in 
Peru, 
by 
strengthening 
the 
focus on school 
initiatives 
and results. 
The 
reform 
will 
increase autonomy 
and 
community 
voice 
in 
decision-making 
at 
the 
school level: establish networks 
in 
rural 
areas 
to 
provide 
support 
for 
isolated 
rural 
schools; 
transform 
the 
existing 
sub-central 
offices 
into 
a 
new structure 
for local 
supervision 
and 
support 
to 
schools 
at 
the 
regional 
and 
sub-regional level;  and 
increase 
the  accountability 
of 
regional  offices 
for 
the  performance 
of 
schools 
and 
other  education 
institutions 
under  their 
jurisdiction. 
Investments 
will 
be 
made 
in 
consulting,  training, 
media 
dissemination,  stakeholder meetings, 
equipment 
for 
sub-central offices, 
and 
evaluation, 
material 
and 
handbook development 
and 
printing.

School 
Development Fund 
This 
sub-component 
will 
support 
the 
implementation 
of 
school-initiated 
improvement  projects 
coordinated 
by 
the 
Rural 
School Networks. 
Since 
the 
ultimate objective 
of 
the education 
system 
is 
to 
support 
students' 
learning improvements 
at 
the 
school level, 
each 
school 
council 
will 
develop 
a 
school 
improvement  plan. 
Individual 
schools 
will 
work 
through 
their 
networks 
to 
support 
each 
other 
in 
diagnosing 
problems, 
setting 
priorities, 
and 
developing credible, time-bound 
action 
plans 
for 
achieving 
their 
individual 
school 
goals. 
As 
a 
network, 
the  schools 
will 
ensure 
that 
these 
school 
level 
plans 
aggregate 
into 
a 
network 
development 
plan 
that 
represents 
a coherent strategy 
for 
the sub-region. 
The 
new 
UGEs 
will 
review 
and approve 
network 
development 
plans. 
To 
assist 
schools 
in 
implementing 
their 
improvement 
plans, 
a 
School Development 
Fund 
will 
be 
established, 
which 
will 
channel 
resources 
to 
individual 
schools 
through 
their 
networks. 
Under 
Phase 
I, 
the 
Project 
will 
finance 
the 
implementation 
of 
150 
PEIs. 
National 
Assessment 
System 
This 
sub-component 
will 
help 
the 
MED 
Quality 
Assessment 
Unit 
(Unidad 
de Medicio'n de 
la 
Calidad 
- 
UMC): 
(a) 
carry  out 
activities 
to 
continue  strengthening 
its 
technical  capacity 
and 
promoting 
the

2nd 
and 
6th 
grade 
students 
of 
primary 
as 
well 
as 
3rd 
and 
5th 
grade 
students 
of 
secondary 
schools. 
Similarly, 
in 
2004 
the 
system 
will 
assess 
citizenship 
education 
(formaci6n 
ciudadana) 
for 
students 
enrolled 
in 
6th 
grade 
of 
primary 
and 
5th 
grade 
of 
secondary education; 
(c) 
develop 
and 
administer 
in 
2004 
a 
census-based assessment 
on 
mathematics 
and 
communication 
skills 
(2nd 
and 
6th 
grades 
of 
primary 
education) 
and 
citizenship education 
(6th 
grade 
of 
primary 
education) 
in 
areas 
determined 
by 
the 
UMC; 
(d) 
develop 
and 
administer 
in 
collaboration 
with 
the 
school 
networks 
a 
self-administered 
census-based 
application 
to 
assess 
mathematics and 
communication 
skills 
of 
students 
enrolled 
in 
6th 
grade 
of 
primary 
schools 
using 
the 
item 
bank 
developed 
by 
the 
UMC. 
These 
tests 
will 
be 
administered 
in 
schools 
of 
the 
project 
area 
in 
2006 after 
a 
pilot 
is 
conducted 
in 
2005. 
In 
addition 
to 
these 
tests 
each 
school 
will 
receive 
a 
set 
of 
materials 
containing 
information 
regarding 
the 
tests, 
how  to 
administer 
them, 
evaluate 
them 
and  interpret  their 
results; 
(e) 
carry 
out 
a 
longitudinal 
study 
aimed 
at 
assessing 
trends 
in 
basic 
education 
in 
areas 
to 
be 
defined 
by 
the 
UMC; 
(f) 
carry 
out 
studies 
to 
assess 
communication 
skills 
in 
a 
sample 
of

Aymara, 
Aguaruna 
and 
two 
variants 
of 
Quechua; 
(g) 
implement 
a 
study 
on 
school 
effectiveness 
in 
a 
small 
number 
of 
schools 
aimed 
at 
complementing national 
assessment 
results 
and 
gathering 
knowledge 
on 
educational 
processes; 
and 
(h) 
finance 
institutions 
or 
consultants 
to 
carry 
out 
research 
using 
the 
data available. 
The 
sub-component 
will 
also 
assist 
the 
Statistics 
Unit 
in: 
(a) 
restructuring 
of 
the statistics 
system; 
(b)

Key 
policy 
and 
institutional 
reforms 
supported 
by 
the 
project: 
The 
project 
will 
contribute 
to two 
areas 
of 
institutional 
reforms. 
These 
policy 
reforms 
are 
already 
being 
supported 
through 
the 
Programmatic 
Social 
Reform 
Loans 
(PSRLI 
and 
PSRLIQ, and 
the 
project 
will 
contribute 
to 
their 
implementation: 
Human 
Resources 
policy. 
The Program 
will 
support 
implementation 
of 
a 
far-reaching, 
systemic 
reform 
designed 
to 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
teachers and 
teaching 
in 
Peru 
by 
addressing 
in 
a 
synergetic 
manner the 
issues 
discussed 
earlier. 
-20- 
Page  27
The 
policy 
was 
developed 
by 
a team 
of 
national 
consultants, 
who 
reviewed 
all 
its 
components 
in 
light 
of 
their 
likely 
impact 
on 
student 
learning, 
especially 
for 
students 
from 
disadvantaged 
backgrounds, 
and 
with 
a 
view 
to 
creating virtuous 
circles 
in 
which 
capacity-building 
and 
incentives 
point 
in 
the 
same 
direction 
and 
reinforce 
each 
other. 
The central piece 
of 
the 
new 
policy 
would 
be 
a 
set 
of 
teaching 
standards 
(10 
initially, 
to 
be 
elaborated 
upon 
by 
level, discipline, 
etc.) 
reflecting national 
and 
international 
research 
findings 
about 
what 
makes 
a 
good 
teacher 
in 
the 
Peruvian context. 
These  standards 
which 
describe 
the  type 
of 
competencies 
(knowledge, 
skills, 
attitudes, 
values) 
expected 
from 
teachers 
at 
different 
levels 
of 
performance 
(novice, 
professional, 
expert, unsatisfactory), 
were 
developed 
in 
a 
participatory 
manner  and 
broadly 
discussed 
to 
ensure 
relevance 
and 
ownership 
by 
the 
profession. The expectation 
was 
that 
greater 
clarity 
should 
guide  improvements 
in 
practice, 
focus  the 
efforts 
of 
teacher 
trainers, 
and 
facilitate 
performance 
evaluation 
by 
reducing 
the 
degree 
of 
subjectivity 
of 
the 
process 
and 
the 
resulting 
anxiety 
for 
those 
being 
evaluated. 
A 
second 
pillar 
of 
the 
new 
policy 
would 
be a 
new, 
more 
differentiated 
professional 
career 
path 
in 
which 
progression 
would 
reward, 
instead 
of 
the  bureaucratic 
years 
of 
service, 
evidence 
of 
acquisition 
of 
the 
above 
competencies 
at 
growing 
levels 
of 
performance 
and 
the 
taking 
on 
of 
new responsibilities. 
Initially 
participation 
in 
this 
“career 
of 
excellence” 
would 
be 
on 
a 
voluntary 
basis, 
with 
higher pay 
for 
those 
teachers 
willing to 
be 
evaluated 
and 
to 
forego 
unconditional 
job 
stability. 
After 
a 
period 
of 
trial 
and 
refinement 
of 
the 
instruments, 
all 
teachers 
would 
be 
included 
in 
the 
scheme, 
except 
for 
those  near 
retirement. 
The 
proposed 
five-step 
career 
would 
recognize the 
needs 
of 
teachers at 
different 
stages 
of 
their professional 
life, 
featuring 
a 
probatory 
induction 
process 
for 
beginners and mentoring 
of 
young 
or 
struggling 
teachers 
by 
seasoned 
colleagues. 
All 
teachers 
would 
be 
expected 
to 
move 
up 
the 
ladder 
for 
the 
first 
three 
levels 
while promotion 
to 
the 
upper levels 
would 
be 
more 
selective. 
However, 
a 
fast track 
would 
be 
available 
for 
the 
more motivated. 
Linked 
to 
this 
new 
career, 
a 
third 
pillar 
would 
be a 
revised compensation 
schedule 
which 
would 
introduce 
the pay 
raises 
promised 
by 
the 
administration. 
Reflecting 
the 
research 
finding 
that 
both 
the 
level 
and 
structure 
of 
pay  determine 
teacher 
effectiveness, 
the 
schedule 
would 
be  considerably 
streamlined, 
featuring 
a 
basic 
salary 
plus 
bonuses 
for 
ruralhardship 
posting, 
for 
additional 
responsibilities, 
and 
for 
performance (possibly on 
a 
whole-school 
basis). 
A 
recent 
teacher 
survey 
has 
shown that a 
majority 
(60 
percent) support the 
idea 
of 
merit 
pay 
as 
long 
as 
the 
criteria 
are 
clear, support 
is 
provided, 
and 
the 
process 
is 
fair. 
The 
details and 
fiscal 
impact 
are 
still 
being 
worked 
out. 
The 
continuum 
of 
standards 
would 
also 
be the 
linchpin for 
a much-needed 
teacher 
quality 
assurance 
(QA) 
system 
with 
the 
following 
key 
features: 
0 
Accreditation 
ofZSPs. 
In 
order 
to 
ensure 
higher 
quality 
of 
teacher 
preparation, over 
the 
first 
two 
phases 
of 
the 
program, 
all 
ISPs 
would 
have 
to 
subject 
themselves 
to 
a process 
of 
renewable accreditation 
by 
a 
specialized Commission 
and 
peers. 
This 
process 
would 
take 
into 
account, 
in 
addition 
to 
the usual 
institutional 
dimensions 
(curriculum, faculty, 
resources), 
the expected 
profile 
of 
beginning 
teachers. 
e 
Teacher 
certification. 
In 
order 
to 
ensure 
minimal 
standards 
of 
teacher 
competency 
across 
the 
board, 
only certified 
teachers 
would 
be 
eligible 
for 
appointment 
and 
authorized 
to 
teach. 
Initially, 
a 
temporary 
certification 
would 
be 
issued 
for 
candidates 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
a 
degree 
from 
an 
accredited 
institution 
(university 
or 
ISP)  and 
the passing 
of 
a test 
based 
on 
the teaching 
standards. 
Full 
initial 
certification 
would 
be subject 
to 
the successful 
completion 
of 
a process 
of 
supervised 
induction 
in 
the 
classroom.

Re-certification. 
In 
order 
to 
ensure 
that the 
average 
competency 
level 
of 
the 
entire teaching 
corps rises 
over 
time, 
all 
teachers 
would 
have 
to 
be 
re-certified 
every 
5-7 
years 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
standards. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
the 
certification 
and 
re-certification 
process 
will 
be voluntary 
during 
the 
initial 
period, 
being 
converted 
to 
compulsory later 
on. 
consistent 
and 
fair 
system 
of 
performance 
evaluation, 
based 
on  the 
standards. 
The 
system 
would 
combine 
formative 
evaluation 
on 
a 
yearly  cycle  to 
improve 
practice 
with 
summative evaluation 
for 
accountability 
and 
promotions. 
It 
would 
capture the many 
facets 
of 
teaching and 
would involve 
different 
stakeholders, 
especially 
school-based 
commissions and 
the sub-regional offices.

Perjormance  evaluation. 
Considerable 
attention 
was 
paid 
to 
the  design 
of 
a 
transparent, 
Overall,  the 
standards 
based 
policy 
would 
strengthen 
alignment between 
stated 
goals 
and 
classroom 
practice. The 
quality 
of 
the 
intake 
into 
faculties 
of 
education 
would 
be 
expected 
to 
increase 
with 
improved 
compensation and 
(possibly) 
scholarships. 
Accredited 
training 
institutions 
would 
do 
a 
better 
job 
of 
preparing 
teachers, 
whose  competencies 
would 
be 
continuously 
upgraded through 
multiple 
opportunities 
for 
professional 
development, 
tightly linked 
to 
the design 
of 
the 
reform 
and 
the 
needs 
of 
schools. 
The latter 
would 
receive 
heightened support 
but 
would 
be 
held 
accountable 
for 
the 
learning 
results 
of 
pupils. 
In 
line 
with 
the 
govemment 
stated 
priorities, 
the 
incentive 
system 
would 
reward 
deployment 
to rural

hardship 
posts. 
While 
the 
overall 
emphasis 
would 
be on 
growth 
and support, 
sanctions 
for 
persistent 
under-performers 
(from 
ISP 
closure 
to 
teacher 
dismissal) 
would 
give 
the 
system 
credibility. 
The 
MIS 
system 
would 
be upgraded 
to 
facilitate 
monitoring 
and 
promote 
transparency. 
Deconcentration and decentralization 
toward 
school 
autonomy. 
The  GOP 
is 
currently 
addressing 
the 
problem 
of 
having 
a 
highly 
centralized 
government 
which 
is 
inefficient 
and 
bureaucratic. 
The 
President 
of 
the 
Council 
of 
Ministers 
is 
currently 
leading 
the 
process 
of 
drafting 
a 
decentralization 
proposal, 
which 
will 
include 
the 
Education 
Sector, 
to 
be 
submitted 
to 
Congress. 
While 
this 
process 
is 
going 
on, 
MED 
has 
identified 
initial 
steps 
to 
be 
taken 
within 
the 
sector 
that 
will 
contribute 
to 
a 
greater 
focus 
on 
the 
school. 
It 
is 
expected that the proposed actions 
will 
not 
be 
affected 
by 
any 
decentralization 
scheme 
proposed 
in 
the new 
law. 
Restructuring 
of 
the Regional ofices. 
Regional 
offices 
are 
in 
the 
process 
of 
restructuring 
in 
order 
to 
eliminate the various former 
structures 
(USE 
and 
ADE) 
to 
create 
the 
UGEs 
(Unidades 
de 
Gestidn 
Educativa), 
which 
will 
focu; 
on 
local 
supervision 
and support 
to 
schools. 
The 
UGEs 
will 
be 
made 
accountable 
for 
school performance 
within 
their 
jurisdictions. 
In 
addition, 
rural 
school networks 
will 
be 
created 
to 
provide 
closer-to-school 
support 
in 
rural 
areas 
where  schools are 
very 
small 
and 
highly 
dispersed. 
The networks 
will 
provide 
a 
venue 
for 
teachers 
to 
come 
together 
to 
discuss 
their 
problems and 
solutions 
as 
well 
as 
to 
receive training.  They 
will 
also 
provide 
a 
closer-to-school layer 
of 
management, 
facilitating 
contact 
with 
the 
UGEs 
and 
linking 
PEIs 
from 
small 
and dispersed schools 
into 
a 
network-PEI. 
Decentralization toward 
the 
school. 
MED 
has 
a 
clear 
vision 
toward 
school 
autonomy. 
However, 
it 
is 
keenly 
aware 
that reaching 
this 
point 
requires capacity 
building 
and 
changes 
in 
the 
legal 
framework. 
Autonomy 
clearly 
requires capacity 
building 
development 
to 
ensure 
that the school 
and 
community 
can 
handle 
this 
new role. 
The 
first 
steps 
in 
this 
direction 
have 
been taken 
in 
the creation 
of 
compulsory 
school 
councils 
which 
are 
expected 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
development, 
implementation 
and evaluation 
of 
the 
Institutional 
Education Plan 
(PEI), 
evaluate the 
use 
of 
school 
and 
Parent Association 
funds 
and 
link 
the 
community 
to 
school activities. 
School councils 
are 
integrated 
by 
the school director 
(who 
presides 
it), 
sub-directors 
(if 
the 
position 
exists 
in 
the 
school), 
two 
teachers, 
two 
students, 
and 
two 
representatives 
of 
the 
parents. 
In 
the 
future, 
and subject 
to 
legal 
reform, 
it 
is 
expected 
that school councils 
will 
manage

funds 
and, 
in 
the 
long 
term, 
be 
responsible 
for 
hiring 
and 
paying 
teachers. 
As 
a 
first 
step, 
this 
Project 
includes the School Development 
Fund 
which 
will 
transfer money 
to 
the 
school councils 
to 
finance key 
activities 
in 
the 
PEI 
that 
will 
lead 
to 
improved 
results 
at 
the 
school level. 
3. 
Benefits and 
target 
population: 
I 
The Program 
is 
targeted 
to rural 
children 
of 
all 
school 
ages 
through 
increased coverage and 
quality 
of 
education. 
The 
policy 
changes 
identified 
as 
necessary 
to 
achieve 
the 
Program objectives 
are 
expected 
to 
benefit 
the 
education 
system 
as 
a whole. 
Expected beneficiaries 
for 
each 
component 
will 
be: 
Expanding 
Access 
(a) 
The 
non-formal 
and 
formal 
preschool education 
program 
would 
benefit 
30,000 
children 
0-2 
years 
old 
in 
rural 
areas, 
including 
a 
large 
proportion 
of 
indigenous 
children 
and 
38,000 
children 
in 
preschool 
programs, 
of 
which 
11,000 
would 
represent 
increased 
coverage. 
(b) 
The distance 
secondary 
education program 
is 
expected 
to 
benefit 
approximately 
5,000 
rural 
students 
in 
116 
schools. 
Improving Quality 
(c) 
The 
continuous 
teacher 
training 
system 
will 
benefit 
directly 
(i) 
1,500 
teacher 
trainers 
in 
public 
sectors 
non-university 
training 
institutions; 
and 
(ii) 
3,800 
teachers 
in 
the 
Project  Area 
working 
in 
multigrade 
schools, and 
15,000 
bilingual 
teachers 
nationwide 
(of 
which 
1,800 
will 
be 
in 
the 
networks and 
will 
benefit 
from 
both 
training 
programs). 
(d) 
330,000 
rural 
children 
in 
the 
Project 
Area 
will 
also 
benefit 
from 
both 
teacher 
training 
and 
from 
the 
provision 
of 
materials, 
as 
these 
factors 
are 
associated 
with 
reduction 
in 
repetition 
and 
desertion 
rates 
and 
with 
improved 
performance 
in 
the 
classroom. 
(e) 
375,000 
indigenous 
children  nationwide 
will 
also 
benefit 
from 
teacher 
training 
in 
intercultural 
bilingual 
education 
and 
from 
the 
provisions 
of 
bilingual 
educational 
materials. 
(f) 
About 
1,900 
classrooms 
in 
poor 
rural 
areas 
will 
benefit 
from 
rehabilitation 
or  substitution 
of 
infrastructure. 
Reform 
of 
Teacher 
Policy and Education 
Management 
(g) 
Increased school 
autonomy and 
networks 
will 
benefit 
3,180 
schools 
by 
allowing 
teachers 
and 
local 
communities 
to 
carry out 
local 
planning 
and 
receiving 
closer and more frequent 
support 
from 
itinerant 
teacher 
support 
groups. 
(h) 
Restructuring 
of 
regional 
offices 
and 
strengthening 
of 
MEDs 
statistical 
system 
will 
contribute 
to 
overall 
greater 
efficiency 
of 
the 
system.

of 
the

activities. 
FONCODES 
will 
carry out the refurbishment 
of 
schools 
according 
to 
an 
annual 
plan 
agreed 
upon 
with 
MED 
and 
will 
be 
subject 
to 
the 
agreement 
to 
be signed 
with 
MED. 
This 
agreement 
will 
include 
the 
environmental guidelines 
to 
be 
used 
by 
FONCODES 
during 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
infrastructure 
sub-projects. 
During 
project 
preparation, 
environmental guidelines 
were 
developed 
and 
discussed 
with 
MED 
and 
FONCODES. 
These are 
being 
used 
by 
FONCODES 
to 
review 
their existing 
guidelines. 
Project  Coordination. 
MED 
will 
be 
assisted 
by 
a 
PCU 
responsible 
for 
overall 
coordination 
and 
monitoring 
of 
project 
implementation.  The 
PCU 
will 
be 
accountable 
to 
the 
Alta 
Direccidn 
(the 
Minister 
and 
Vice-Ministers) 
and 
will 
report 
to 
the 
Project  Steering  Committee, 
in 
which 
the 
key 
MED 
directorates 
will 
participate. 
Detailed 
procedures 
for 
procurement 
and 
financial 
management 
processes 
will 
be 
specified 
in 
the 
Operations 
Manual. 
Regardless 
of 
size, 
contracting 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
using 
procurement procedures 
and standard 
bidding 
documents 
satisfactory 
to 
the 
Bank. 
The 
PCU 
will 
procure 
goods 
and 
services. 
Operations Manuals. 
The 
project 
will 
use  an 
Operations 
Manual 
covering 
all 
aspects 
of 
project 
implementation, 
including 
but 
not 
limited 
to: 
project 
components, 
organizational 
and 
management 
structures, 
supervision 
and 
evaluation 
mechanisms; 
targeting and other 
criteria 
for 
resource 
allocation; 
procedures 
for 
the 
formulation 
of 
annual 
implementation 
plans, 
financial,  accounting  and 
auditing 
procedures; 
procurement 
procedures  and  standard 
bidding 
documents; 
structure 
of 
the 
Steering 
Committee 
and 
environmental guidelines 
to 
be 
used 
in 
the 
refurbishment 
of 
the 
schools. 
The adoption 
of 
an 
Operations 
Manual 
satisfactory 
to 
the 
Bank 
is 
a 
condition 
for 
effectiveness. 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation 
Arrangements. 
Project 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
will 
measure 
not only 
procedures 
but 
also 
results, 
thereby 
allowing 
the 
project 
to 
learn. 
The 
PCU 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
monitoring 
of 
the 
Project 
as 
well 
as 
for 
results 
and 
impact evaluation. 
Monitoring 
of 
the coverage 
of 
the 
Project 
interventions 
will 
be 
based 
on 
PCU 
administrative 
data 
and 
statistical 
information 
from 
MEDs 
information 
system. 
Given 
that 
the system 
requires 
further 
strengthening, the 
Project 
will 
finance technical 
assistance 
to 
MEDs 
Statistics 
Unit 
in 
order 
to 
refurbish 
the 
data 
collection 
and 
auditing 
system, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
GIs. 
Progress 
reports, 
including monitoring 
indicators 
will 
be 
submitted 
by 
the 
PCU 
every six 
months. 
An 
annual 
review 
of 
the 
Project 
will 
be 
carried out 
jointly 
with 
the 
Bank 
based 
on 
these Progress 
reports. 
The 
Bank 
will 
carry out 
at 
least 
two 
technical supervision missions 
per 
year 
in 
close coordination 
with 
MED, 
FONCODES 
and 
MEF. 
Prior 
to 
December 
2005, 
the  Bank, 
in 
close 
collaboration 
with 
MED 
and 
FONCODES 
will 
conduct 
a 
comprehensive 
mid-term 
evaluation 
of 
the 
Project.  The results 
of 
this 
evaluation 
will 
be 
used 
to 
propose 
eventual 
adjustments 
or 
changes 
to 
improve Project 
implementation. 
Evaluation 
of 
the 
Project 
results 
and 
impact 
will 
be 
based 
on data 
of 
the 
LSMS 
and 
on custom 
designed 
sample-based 
and 
case 
studies. 
The 
studies 
will 
aim 
at 
both 
assessing 
the 
project 
as 
well 
as 
to 
learn 
and 
provide 
feedback 
to 
improve project 
implementation.  The evaluation 
studies 
will 
include, 
but 
will 
not 
be 
limited 
to, 
a 
mid-term 
evaluation, 
an 
impact evaluation, 
and 
a 
case-study 
to 
determine the 
impact on 
teacher 
training 
in 
their 
performance 
in 
the 
classroom 
as 
well 
as 
in 
the 
learning 
processes.

Project Rationale 
1. 
Project 
alternatives 
considered 
and 
reasons 
for 
rejection: 
An APL 
vs 
a regular 
investment 
project 
The 
Government 
has 
set 
clear 
goals 
for 
educational 
sector 
improvement and 
has 
publicly 
committed 
to 
major 
reforms 
of 
teacher 
policy 
and 
education 
management, 
two 
of 
the 
longest standing constraints 
to 
educational 
progress 
in 
Peru. 
It 
will 
require 
years 
to 
implement 
and consolidate 
these 
ambitious reforms. 
Because 
the 
Government 
has 
established a 
medium-term 
vision 
for 
the 
sector 
and 
is 
directly tackling 
the 
key 
sectorial 
issues 
identified 
in 
previous 
analytical work 
by 
the 
World 
Bank 
and other 
groups, 
an 
APL 
is 
the 
most 
appropriate instrument 
for providing 
sustained 
support 
to 
the Government over the 
reform 
period. 
Because 
of 
the focus on 
providing timely 
assistance 
to 
the 
GOP 
as 
it 
moves 
quickly 
with 
the design 
and 
implementation 
of 
these 
reforms, 
the 
details 
of 
investments 
to 
be 
supported 
under the entire 
project 
cannot be 
fully 
appraised 
at 
this 
point.  The 
APL 
instrument 
provides 
the 
flexibility to pilot 
and evaluate 
proposed 
investments 
(such 
as 
the 
secondary 
distance 
education modalities) 
during 
the 
Phase 
I 
of 
the 
program 
and, 
on 
this 
basis, 
to 
develop 
the 
investment 
priorities 
for 
further 
years, 
which 
a 
regular 
investment program 
would 
not. 
Exclusive 
focus 
on basic 
education 
vs. 
inclusion 
of 
pre-school and 
ECD 
investments 
as 
well. 
The 
inclusion 
of 
pre-school and 
ECD 
investments 
bring 
in 
an 
added 
level 
of 
implementation 
complexity 
to 
an 
already 
complex Project. 
However, the pedagogical and economic benefits stemming 
from 
the 
investment 
on 
early 
years 
have 
been shown 
to 
play 
a 
decisive 
role 
in 
children’s performance 
in 
primary 
school 
and 
later. 
Thus, 
because 
of 
the importance 
that 
ECD 
and pre-school 
exposure 
has 
for 
achieving 
the 
core 
project 
goal 
of 
100 
percent 
primary 
completion 
in 
rural 
areas 
as 
well 
as 
their 
numerous 
other 
benefits, 
it 
was 
decided 
to 
include 
these 
investments 
in 
the 
Program. 
However, 
the 
ECD 
interventions 
are 
being 
introduced 
in 
Phase 
I 
only 
on 
a 
pilot 
basis, 
due 
to 
the 
lack 
of 
significant 
prior 
experience 
in 
the 
rural 
areas. 
Supply 
side 
vs. 
demand 
side 
financing. 
Although 
it 
is 
clear that education supply 
in 
rural 
areas 
is 
constrained 
at 
the 
pre-school 
and 
secondary 
levels, 
primary 
school 
coverage 
is 
quite 
high 
and close 
to 
100 
percent 
of 
rural 
children begin 
first 
grade 
at some 
point. 
The 
significantly 
lower 
completion 
rate 
in 
rural 
areas 
undoubtedly 
stems 
from 
the 
low 
quality 
of 
many 
schools, 
but 
demand 
for 
schooling 
may also 
be constrained 
by 
direct 
costs 
to 
parents 
(for 
uniforms 
and 
materials) 
and 
opportunity 
costs. 
Demand-side 
interventions 
in 
Brazil 
(Bolsa  Escola), 
Mexico 
(Progresa) 
and 
several  other 
Latin 
American countries have 
been 
effective 
in 
increasing schooling 
retention 
rates 
among 
children 
from 
very 
poor 
families. 
It 
was 
agreed 
that 
an 
analysis 
of 
this 
issue 
would 
be 
carried 
out under 
Phase 
I 
in 
order 
to 
include relevant interventions 
during 
the 
second 
and 
third 
phases. 
Traditional 
secondary 
education 
vs 
distance 
education 
Analyses have 
shown that 
traditional 
models 
of 
secondary 
education 
in 
Peru’s 
highly 
dispersed 
rural 
- 
25 
- 
Page  32
areas 
would 
be 
prohibitively 
expensive. 
Although 
the 
use 
of  ICT 
(Information 
Communication 
Technology 
- 
ICT) 
for 
distance education 
offers 
the 
clear 
potential 
for 
a 
more cost-effective 
secondary 
education 
service 
delivery 
in 
rural 
areas, 
it 
is 
not 
yet clear 
which 
of 
several 
alternative models 
is 
most 
appropriate and effective 
in 
the 
Peruvian context. 
The 
program 
will 
support 
the 
piloting 
of 
several 
alternative models 
during 
Phase 
I 
and 
a 
careful 
evaluation 
of 
these, 
to 
guide 
the 
choice 
of 
model or 
models 
to 
be adopted 
in 
the 
subsequent 
program 
phases.

3. 
Lessons 
learned and 
reflected 
in 
the 
project 
design: 
Rural 
education 
has 
been 
particularly 
defying 
when 
trying 
to 
implement actions 
to 
achieve 
equity and 
quality 
objectives. 
Projects 
such 
as 
EDURURAL 
in 
Northeast 
Brazil, 
Colombia’s 
Escuela 
Nueva, 
and 
El 
Salvador’s 
EDUCO, 
among others 
have 
been 
exemplary 
on how 
to 
address 
the specific 
needs 
of 
rural 
education 
in 
a 
diversity 
of 
approaches 
and many 
lessons 
have 
been 
derived 
from 
them 
in 
the design 
of 
this 
Project. 
Bilingual 
education 
has 
proven 
to 
be 
a 
cost-effective 
means 
to 
reduce 
repetition 
and dropout 
rates 
as 
well 
as 
low 
academic 
achievement 
in 
indigenous populations, 
as 
observed 
in 
a 
number 
of 
World 
Bank 
projects 
in 
Mexico, 
Guatemala and 
Bolivia. 
The current 
bilingual 
education 
program 
in 
Peru 
has 
yielded 
valuable 
information 
on 
teacher 
training, 
production 
and 
distribution 
of 
materials 
and 
communication 
with 
the 
community, 
which 
have 
been 
taken 
into 
consideration 
during 
the 
design 
of 
the 
relevant activities 
to 
be 
carried out 
under 
the 
Project. 
Teacher 
training 
has 
been 
object 
of 
renewed 
and 
increasing interest 
as 
the most 
important 
quality 
factor 
for 
school-based 
education improvement. Projects 
like 
the 
Brazilian 
FUNDESCOLA 
and 
Parand, 
the 
Mexican PAREB 
and 
the 
Uruguayan 
MECAEP 
emphasized 
teacher 
training 
in 
a 
way that 
proved 
to 
be 
decisive. 
The 
proposed 
project 
will 
help 
design 
a 
carefully 
conceived “continuous 
teacher 
training 
system” 
with 
immediate 
application 
to 
teacher 
training 
in 
rural 
areas. 
School 
autonomy 
has 
been 
the 
focus 
of 
well-known 
and 
positive 
education reforms 
in 
Minas 
Gerais 
(Brazil),  Chile, 
El 
Salvador and 
Nicaragua 
as 
a 
meaningful 
strategy 
to 
boost 
local 
ownership 
and 
community participation. The 
proposed 
project 
will 
support 
school 
autonomy 
mainly 
by 
the 
development 
of 
the “education 
community” 
concept, 
strengthening 
of 
the school councils and 
the development and 
implementation 
of 
the 
school-centered 
Institutional 
Education Plan 
- 
PEL 
The 
concept 
of 
school 
network 
as 
an 
instrument 
for 
micro-regional 
school association 
and 
planning 
has 
been 
implemented 
in 
Ecuador 
and 
in 
Ceard 
(Brazil) 
with 
the 
Regional Education 
Development 
Centers 
- 
CREDE. 
In 
the 
project preparation period, Peruvian professionals benefited 
from 
Ecuadorian 
assistance 
and 
visited 
the 
Ceard model. 
Both 
cases 
inspired 
the 
design 
of 
the 
proposed school 
network 
structure, 
which 
seeks 
to 
promote closer-to-school 
management 
and 
pedagogical 
initiatives 
in 
rural 
areas. 
Provision 
of 
secondary 
education  through  distance 
leaming, 
with 
support 
from 
information 
and 
communications 
technology, 
has 
been 
carried 
out 
in 
a 
number 
of 
countries, 
including 
Mexico 
and 
Colombia, 
Results 
are 
encouraging showing 
positive 
impacts 
both 
in 
coverage and 
quality 
that 
are 
comparable 
or, 
sometimes, 
better than 
traditional 
secondary 
education. 
This 
project 
also 
builds 
on 
the 
lessons 
learned 
form 
the 
Peru  Primary 
Education 
Quality 
Project, 
particularly 
on 
teacher 
training 
and 
production 
of 
materials. 
This 
Project 
found 
a successful 
mechanism 
for 
the 
provision 
of 
teacher 
training 
through the 
use 
of 
Universities,  ISPs 
and 
NGOs, 
as 
opposed 
to 
internal 
training 
programs. 
Production 
and 
distribution 
of 
materials 
for 
primary 
grades 
in 
Spanish 
was 
also 
successful 
and 
is 
now 
being carried 
out 
regularly 
by 
MED. 
These processes 
will 
continue 
during 
the 
implementation 
of 
this 
project. 
Only 
materials 
targeted 
to 
the 
multigrade 
classrooms 
(including 
self-paced 
materials) 
will 
be produced and 
tested. 
The 
same 
strategy 
will 
be 
used 
during 
this 
project. 
The previous project, 
was 
implemented 
by 
the 
Ministry 
under 
MECEP-PCU 
coordination. 
The 
Project 
-27- 
Page  34
PCU 
staff 
was 
only 
dedicated 
to 
the 
administration 
of 
the 
Project 
funds. 
This 
project 
implementation 
system 
ensures 
process 
ownership 
and 
sustainability. However, 
it 
also 
creates 
lags 
in 
implementation 
mainly 
because 
there 
is 
great 
need 
for 
intra-institutional 
coordination. The 
first 
lesson 
learned 
is 
that 
it 
is 
better 
to 
sacrifice timeliness 
for 
ownership. 
Even 
though 
it 
would 
be more 
practical 
and 
timely 
to 
have a 
separate 
group 
of 
people executing project activities, 
it 
is 
best 
to 
involve 
the 
whole 
Ministry, 
keeping 
the 
responsibility 
under 
the 
directorships. 
The 
proposed project 
would 
also 
be implemented 
by 
the 
Ministry 
while 
intra-institutional 
coordination 
issues 
would 
be 
addressed 
through 
the 
participating 
directorates 
and 
facilitated 
by 
the Steering Committee. 
A 
small-size and 
qualified 
PCU 
was 
able enough 
to 
manage, 
particularly 
for 
the last 
two 
years, 
the 
Primary Education Quality 
Improvement 
Project 
- 
MECEP 
(1996-2001) 
and carry 
it 
out 
to 
successful 
and 
timely 
completion. 
Among 
other 
lessons learned, 
the 
continuity 
of 
committed 
staff 
was 
key 
to 
successful 
implementation. 
Through the preparation 
of 
the Programmatic Social 
Reform 
Loans (PSRL 
I 
and 
PSRL 
II) 
there 
was 
frequent 
contact 
with 
other 
ongoing 
Peruvian projects 
in 
the  social 
areas. 
This 
helped place 
this 
education 
project 
in 
a 
broader 
political 
and 
administrative  framework, 
which 
has 
added 
synergy 
to 
project-supported 
components. 
One 
of 
the 
lessons 
learned 
in 
this 
process 
is 
that the 
Bank 
needs 
to 
pay 
more 
attention 
to 
inter-institutional 
processes 
as 
part 
of 
project 
design 
and 
supervision. 
This 
new 
project 
will 
benefit 
from 
the 
same 
interaction 
with 
other 
Bank 
or 
otherwise social 
projects 
in 
the 
country. 
The 
availability 
of 
a 
well-conducted 
sector 
work 
means 
a 
source 
of 
information 
and 
a 
comparative 
point 
for 
data 
validation. 
This 
role 
was 
played 
by 
"Peruvian 
Education 
at 
a Crossroads 
: 
Challenges and 
Opportunities 
for 
the 
21st 
Century" (Washington, 
DC: 
The 
World 
Bank, 
2001) 
in 
the 
whole 
preparation 
process. 
4. 
Indications 
of 
borrower 
commitment and 
ownership: 
The 
Project strongly 
reflects 
State and 
GOP 
priorities 
put 
forth 
in 
the 
National 
Agreement 
as 
well 
as 
priorities 
which 
have 
been 
stated 
in 
its 
major 
policy 
document 
as 
well 
as 
in 
other specific 
documents 
which 
have already 
been 
published 
or 
are 
in 
the preparation 
process. 
For 
exaqple, 
MED 
prepared the 
"Politica Nacional 
de Lenguas y 
Culturas" (National Policies 
on 
Language and Culture), 
a document 
that 
reflects 
the 
national 
bilingual 
intercultural policy, 
which 
was 
developed under 
wide 
consultation 
with 
stakeholders. 
MED 
is 
also 
finalizing 
its 
document 
on 
rural 
education 
policy 
which 
has 
also been 
prepared 
under 
wide consultation 
with 
stakeholders.  Studies 
and 
workshops 
were 
carried 
out 
by 
MED 
to 
propose 
a 
new teaching 
career 
including 
salary 
scales, 
accreditation 
systems 
for 
teachers 
and 
teacher 
training 
institutions 
and 
teacher 
evaluation criteria. 
These 
policies 
are 
reflected 
in 
the 
Bank's 
Programmatic 
Social 
Reform 
Loans 
(PSRL). 
GOP 
initially 
prepared and 
submitted 
the 
proposal 
for 
this 
project 
to 
the Bank. 
During 
the 
Project 
preparation period, 
the 
GOP 
instituted 
the 
National 
Public 
Investment System 
(Sistemu 
Nucionul 
de 
Znversio'n 
Pu'blicu, 
SNIP) 
which 
requires 
that 
all 
investment projects, 
regardless 
of 
the 
source 
of 
funding, 
be subjected 
to 
rigorous technical evaluation. 
Although 
compliance 
with 
the requirements 
of 
the 
SNP 
was 
a 
cause 
for 
significant delay 
in 
Project preparation, 
it 
contributed 
to 
strengthening Project ownership 
on 
the 
part 
of 
MED 
and 
MOF. 
5. 
Value 
added 
of 
Bank 
support 
in 
this 
project: 
The 
World 
Bank 
has 
extensive 
experience 
in 
supporting 
projects 
on 
rural 
education, 
with 
strong 
multigrade, 
bilingual 
and 
intercultural 
components. 
Also, 
the 
Bank 
has 
wide 
experience 
in 
-28- 
Page  35
decentralization 
programs 
where 
local 
communities 
play 
an 
important 
role. 
The 
experience 
gained 
in 
Central 
America, 
Brazil 
and 
Colombia 
in 
these 
areas 
will 
be 
instrumental 
in 
assisting 
MED's 
efforts 
in 
developing 
quality 
education 
in 
rural 
areas. 
The 
Bank 
has 
already 
been 
working 
with 
GOP extensively 
in 
the 
early 
implementation 
of 
the 
proposed 
reforms. 
The 
project 
is 
tied 
to 
the Programmatic 
Social 
Reform 
Loans  (PSRL 
I 
and 
II) 
which 
is 
promoting 
the 
development 
of 
the 
new 
teacher 
career 
structure 
and 
the 
piloting 
of 
a 
rural 
teacher 
incentive 
program, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
first 
steps 
toward 
decentralization and community participation. 
E. 
Summary Project 
Analysis 
(Detailed 
assessments 
are 
in 
the 
project file, 
see 
Annex 
8) 
1. 
Economic 
(see 
Annex 
4): 
Cost 
benefit 
0 
Cost effectiveness 
0 
Other (specify) 
NPV=US$ 
million; 
ERR 
= 
15 
% 
(see 
Annex 
4) 
The 
results 
of 
the 
cost 
benefit 
analysis 
are 
based 
on 
relatively 
conservative 
and 
alternative 
scenarios 
that 
were 
constructed 
using 
various 
assumptions 
of 
improvements 
in 
efficiency 
rates, 
including 
productivity, 
repetition 
and 
dropout 
rates 
resulting 
from 
the  implementation 
of 
the 
project.  Each 
scenario 
was 
compared 
to 
a 
baseline 
(without 
project) 
that 
assumes 
a 
decrease 
of 
10 
percent on 
repetition 
and 
dropout 
rates 
on 
primary 
and 
secondary 
levels. 
The 
analysis 
shows 
that the 
project 
is 
viable 
from 
an 
economic 
point 
of 
view. 
Despite 
being 
conservative 
in 
terms 
of 
the expected 
improvement 
in 
external 
efficiency 
rates and 
with 
conservative 
assumptions 
of 
GDP 
growth, 
ERR 
(Economic 
Rate 
of 
Return) 
estimates 
fall 
in 
the 
range 
of 
8 
to 
16 
percent 
for 
the 
initial 
education intervention. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
primary 
education, 
the 
estimated 
ERR 
fall 
in 
the 
range 
of 
8 
to 
23 
percent. 
In 
a reasonable 
scenario, 
in 
which 
primary completion 
rates reach 
90 
percent 
in 
10 
years, 
the 
ERR 
ranges 
between 
1 
1.4 
percent 
and 
17.7 
percent, 
depending 
on 
assumptions 
regarding 
once 
and 
for 
all 
small 
increases 
in 
productivity 
as 
a 
consequence 
of 
improvement 
of 
quality 
of 
education. 
The 
results 
of 
the 
analysis 
should 
be 
considered 
as 
a 
lower 
bound, 
given 
that the 
economic 
indicators 
used 
were 
quite 
conservative 
and 
the 
estimates 
of 
the 
ERR 
do 
not 
take 
into 
account 
all 
externalities 
resulting 
from 
the 
Project. 
In 
addition, 
several 
components 
of 
the project, 
such 
as 
the 
teacher 
training 
institutions 
accreditation 
system, 
the 
institutional 
strengthening and the 
reform 
of 
the 
teachers' career are 
elements that 
will 
benefit 
all 
Peruvian 
students. 
Thus, 
the analysis 
leads 
to 
the conclusion 
that 
there 
is 
reasonable 
certainty that 
a comprehensive 
intervention 
in 
rural 
education, 
such 
as 
this 
Project, should 
effect 
changes 
in 
key 
education indicators, 
as 
long 
as 
it 
is 
implemented appropriately 
and 
as 
planned. 
2. 
Financial 
(see 
Annex 
4 
and 
Annex 
5): 
NPV=US$ 
million; 
FRR 
= 
% 
(see 
Annex 
4) 
Several 
alternative 
scenarios 
of 
expenditures 
for 
the 
following 
years, 
and 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
project 
costs 
over 
total 
expenditures 
were 
calculated. 
There 
are 
only preliminary 
figures 
for 
overall 
educational 
expenditures 
in 
2003. 
Between 
2000 and 
2001 there 
was 
a 
reduction 
in 
educational 
expenditures. 
During 
the 
first 
half 
of 
2001, 
with 
the 
Transition 
Government, 
there 
was 
a 
contraction 
of 
fiscal 
expenditures. 
Later, 
in 
the 
second 
half 
of 
the 
year, 
the 
new government increased 
expenditures 
slightly, 
including 
a 
9 
percent 
raise 
in 
teachers salaries, 
which 
was 
the 
first 
increase 
in 
pensionable 
salaries 
in 
25 
years. 
In 
2002, 
public 
educational expenditures 
were 
US$ 
1.71 
billion, 
representing 
3 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
Given 
the 
priorities 
established 
by 
the 
current 
administration, 
it 
is 
likely 
that 
resources 
devoted 
to 
-29- 
Page  36
education 
will 
increase. 
The 
GOP 
has 
established, 
although 
not formally, 
two 
specific 
targets, one 
is 
the 
increase 
of 
the 
share 
of 
education 
in 
the 
public 
budget 
from 
the current 
19 
percent 
to 
30 
percent 
in 
2006. 
The 
second 
one 
is 
doubling 
teachers' salaries 
by 
that 
year. 
It 
will 
probably be 
difficult 
to 
meet 
any 
of 
these 
targets. 
There 
are 
two 
main 
points 
that 
can 
be 
derived 
from 
the 
financial 
analysis. 
First, 
the current 
size 
of 
the 
public 
sector 
is 
small 
to 
sustain 
an 
important 
increase 
in 
educational 
expenditures. 
A 
reform 
will 
be 
required 
to 
restructure 
the 
public 
sector 
in 
order 
to 
increase 
the 
share 
of 
educational 
expenditures. 
Second, 
any 
attainable 
change 
in 
the structure 
of 
expenditures 
within 
the 
public 
sector 
will 
fall 
short 
of 
what 
is 
needed 
to 
increase expenditures 
in 
education. 
The 
country requires 
an increase 
in 
the 
overall 
ratio 
of 
government expenditures 
as 
a 
percentage 
of 
GDP. 
However, 
for 
any 
increase 
in 
this 
line 
to 
be 
effective, 
a 
previous 
reform 
of 
the 
public 
sector 
is 
required. 
Fiscal 
Impact: 
The 
fiscal 
impact 
of 
the 
project 
is 
relatively 
small. Calculations were 
made 
taking 
into 
accountted the 
state 
counterpart, the 
implicit 
additional fiscal 
costs 
due 
to 
higher 
enrollments 
generated 
by 
both 
the 
initial 
education 
and 
basic 
education interventions, recurrent 
costs and debt 
service. 
The 
financial 
impact 
has 
been 
calculated 
using 
the 
scenario 
of 
the 
economic 
analysis 
which 
assumes 
a 
reduction 
in 
repetition 
rates 
of 
50 
percent 
and 
dropout 
rates 
of 
75 
percent 
by 
2009. 
Until 
2009, 
all 
implicit, 
recurrent 
and 
direct project 
expenditures amount 
to 
less 
than 
1 
percent 
of 
the 
overall 
expenditures 
in 
education, 
reaching 
at 
most 
0.78 
percent 
of 
additional 
costs. 
Also, 
they 
represent 
less 
than 
2 percent 
of 
current expenditures 
in 
initial 
and basic 
education. Recurrent 
costs are 
mainly 
training 
expenditures and materials. 
They 
increase 
sharply 
in 
the 
two 
years 
following 
phase 
one due 
to 
training 
interventions that 
start 
in 
2004 and 
2005 
that last 
for 
three 
years. 
Afterwards, 
these 
costs 
fall. 
However, 
as 
a 
proportion 
of 
rural 
expenditures, 
the 
project 
has 
a 
larger 
impact. 
As 
shown, 
it 
amounts 
to 
4.3 
percent 
of 
overall 
projected 
expenditures. 
This 
figure might 
be under 
estimated, 
because 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
expenditures 
per 
student 
do 
not 
vary 
between 
rural 
and urban 
areas. 
Currently, 
rural 
expenditures 
per 
pupil 
are 
probably 
lower 
than 
in 
urban 
areas, 
so 
the 
increase 
in 
expenditures  related 
to 
this 
project 
may 
even be 
more significant 
in 
relation 
to 
what 
is 
currently 
spent 
in 
these 
areas. 
In 
addition, expenditures 
in 
rural 
areas 
may 
increase sharply 
two 
or 
three 
years 
from 
now 
if 
as 
part 
of 
the 
reform 
in 
teachers' career 
there 
is 
an increase 
in 
salaries 
and 
bonuses 
in 
order 
to 
attract 
high 
performance 
teachers 
to rural 
areas. 
3. 
Technical: 
The 
following 
issues 
will 
be 
monitored 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
continued  focus  on 
rural 
children: 
(i) 
restructuring 
of 
the 
regional offices 
in 
order 
to 
better 
serve 
schools; 
(ii) 
ensuring that 
bilingual 
schools 
are 
mapped adequately 
in 
order 
to 
include 
them 
into 
the 
program; 
(iii) 
the  development 
of 
a 
clear 
accountability 
system 
that defines roles 
and 
responsibilities 
at 
all 
levels; (iv) 
the 
links 
with 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
and 
Ministry 
of Women 
and 
Social 
Development 
for 
the 
non-formal 
ECD 
programs 
to 
ensure 
health prevention 
and 
nutrition 
education 
are 
adequately 
included 
in 
the programs 
and; 
(v) 
follow-up on 
overall 
social 
policies 
with CIAS 
(Comision 
Interministerial 
de 
Asuntos 
Sociales 
- 
CIAS). 
4. 
Institutional: 
4.1 
Executing 
agencies: 
MED 
will 
be 
the 
primary 
executing 
agency 
and 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
overall 
Project 
implementation 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Operations 
Manual 
satisfactory 
to 
the 
Bank. 
MED 
will 
be responsible 
for 
the 
-30- 
Page  37
execution 
of 
all 
activities, 
except 
the infrastructure 
sub-projects. 
FONCODES 
will 
be responsible for 
the execution 
of 
the 
infrastructure 
sub-projects 
under 
a 
yearly 
plan 
agreed 
with 
MED 
where 
all 
works 
will 
be 
limited 
to 
the 116 networks, unless 
the 
Bank otherwise 
agrees. 
4.2 
Project 
management: 
Project 
management 
will 
be under 
the responsibility 
of 
the 
MED 
PCU, 
which 
will 
be 
responsible for 
overall 
coordination, 
supervision, 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
of 
Project  activities  which 
will 
be 
implemented 
directly 
by 
MED 
line 
directorates. 
The 
Unit 
will 
prepare 
an 
annual Operations Plan 
which 
will 
reflect 
activities  planned 
and requested 
by 
MED's 
Directorates  which, 
in 
turn, 
will 
be 
fully 
responsible 
for 
the 
technical content 
of 
the 
Project. 
The 
PCU 
will 
be 
fully 
accountable 
to 
MED's 
Alta 
Direccih 
(Minister 
and 
Vice-Ministers 
of 
Education) 
and 
will 
be 
monitored 
through 
a 
Steering 
Committed 
whose 
final 
composition 
will 
be 
determined 
in 
the 
Project Operations 
Manual. 
4.3 
Procurement 
issues: 
Procurement 
of 
works 
and 
goods 
for 
the 
proposed 
project 
would 
be 
carried 
out 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
World 
Bank 
"Guidelines: 
Procurement Under 
IBRD 
Loans 
and 
IDA 
Credits", 
published 
in 
January 
1995 
(revised 
January/August 
1996, 
September 1997 
and 
January 
1999); 
and 
the employment 
of 
Consultants 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
"Guidelines: 
Selection 
and 
Employment 
of 
Consultants 
by 
World 
Bank 
Borrowers 
" 
published 
in 
January 
1997 
(revised 
in 
September  1999,  January 
1997  and 
May 
2002), 
and 
the 
provisions stipulated 
in 
the 
Loan 
Agreement. 
These 
procedures 
are 
specified 
in 
greater 
detail 
in 
Annex 
6. 
The 
PCU 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
procurement 
activities 
under 
the 
project 
as 
defined 
in 
the Operations 
Manual. 
The 
procurement 
section 
of 
the 
Operations 
Manual 
will 
include, 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
procurement 
procedures, 
the 
Standard 
Bidding 
Documents 
to 
be 
used 
in 
each 
case, 
as 
well 
as 
contracts 
to 
be 
awarded 
on the 
basis 
of 
quotations.  Where 
no 
relevant 
standard contracts exists, 
other 
standard 
forms 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank 
shall 
be 
used. 
A 
procurement capacity 
assessment was 
carried out 
for 
the 
PCU 
and 
FONCODES 
aimed 
at 
reviewing 
their 
current  capacity and assigning 
a 
level 
of 
risk 
to 
administer procurement  functions 
and 
other 
administrative 
tasks. 
The 
overall 
procurement 
risk 
assessment 
level 
was 
deemed 
as 
average 
for 
both 
the 
PCU 
and 
FONCODES. 
A 
Procurement 
Improvement 
Action 
Plan 
was 
agreed 
upon 
with 
both 
agencies. 
Two 
procurement supervision missions 
per 
year 
will 
be 
carried out 
including 
one 
special procurement 
supervision 
for 
ex-post 
review/audit. 
4.4 
Financial 
management 
issues: 
The 
financial 
management 
systems 
in 
both 
the 
MED 
PCU 
and 
FONCODES 
relating 
to 
the 
Project 
have 
been 
reviewed 
by 
the 
Bank 
Financial 
Management 
Specialist 
and 
found 
satisfactory 
to 
the 
Bank 
under 
OP/BP 
10.02. 
The 
PCU 
and 
FONCODES 
have 
in 
place 
adequate 
project 
financial 
management systems 
that 
can 
provide, 
with 
reasonable 
assurance, 
accurate 
and 
timely information 
on the 
financial 
operations 
of 
the 
project. 
A 
CFAA 
for 
Peru 
was 
conducted 
in 
2000 
and an 
action 
plan 
agreed 
with 
the new  Government 
in 
September 
of 
2001.The 
findings 
of 
the 
study 
revealed 
the 
overall 
strength 
of 
the integrated 
financial 
management system 
SIAF 
and 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
National 
Audit 
Institution. The 
weaknesses 
arose 
where 
these 
two 
elements 
were 
not 
applied 
i.e. 
Ministry 
of 
Defense, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
the 
Interior 
and the 
National

Environmental:

Summarize 
the 
steps 
undertaken 
for 
environmental 
assessment 
and 
EMP 
preparation 
(including 
consultation 
and 
disclosure) 
and 
the 
significant 
issues 
and 
their 
treatment emerging 
from 
this 
analysis. 
The 
environmental impact 
of 
the 
project 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
insignificant 
since 
only  rehabilitation 
of 
schools 
will 
be 
financed. 
MED 
is 
not projecting 
any 
growth 
in 
primary 
schools and 
any 
infrastructure 
for 
the 
preschool 
classrooms 
or 
secondary 
program 
would 
be 
linked 
to 
existing 
schools. 
During 
project 
preparation, a 
set 
of 
guidelines 
were 
prepared 
for 
the 
project's 
civil 
works 
in 
order 
to 
incorporate simple 
environmental  rules 
for 
project 
design, 
evaluation,  and  supervision. 
These 
guidelines 
have 
been 
discussed 
in 
detail 
with 
FONCODES 
and 
are 
being 
used 
to 
enrich 
the 
existing 
FONCODES 
environmental guidelines 
for 
school 
infrastructure. 
The 
environmental guidelines 
will 
become 
integral 
part 
of 
the 
Operations 
Manual 
and 
of 
the 
MED-FONCODES 
agreement. 
Environmental Category: 
C 
(Not

FONCODES, 
the 
executing 
unit 
for 
the 
infrastructure 
sub-projects, 
has 
already 
implemented 
environmental 
assessment 
and 
mitigation 
measures 
into 
the 
project 
cycle. 
The 
above 
guidelines 
would 
be 
used 
to 
enrich 
the 
FONCODES 
procedures 
in 
order 
to 
strengthen 
two 
areas 
where 
the 
environmental 
safeguards 
were 
weaker, 
that 
is 
project 
screening and 
supervision. 
The 
FONCODES 
Project 
cycle 
already 
includes  environmental 
assessment 
during 
the  evaluation 
period 
and 
assurances 
of 
the 
implementation 
of 
mitigation 
measures 
during 
supervision.

Social: 
6.1 
Summarize 
key social 
issues 
relevant 
to 
the 
project 
objectives, and specify 
the 
project's social 
development 
outcomes. 
A 
review 
of 
the 
legal 
framework 
shows 
that ethnic, 
cultural 
and 
language 
diversity 
are 
recognized, 
valued 
and 
supported 
by 
the 
State. 
The constitution 
upholds 
universal 
human 
rights, 
recognizes 
ethnic 
and 
cultural 
diversity 
and 
all 
native 
languages 
as 
official 
in 
Peru, 
wherever 
spoken. 
The 
General 
Law 
of 
Education 
as 
well 
as 
other laws related 
to 
education 
(including 
the 
LO 
Convention 
No. 
169) 
decree 
that 
bilingual 
education 
is 
a 
right for 
all 
indigenous 
peoples whenever feasible. 
These 
principles 
are 
all 
reflected 
in 
the 
Supreme 
Decree 
creating 
the 
"Direcci6n 
de 
Educaci6n 
Bilingue 
Intercultural" 
currently 
responsible 
for 
the 
bilingual 
education program. 
A 
beneficiary 
assessment 
was 
carried 
out 
during 
the 
preparation 
of 
the  project. 
The 
Bilingual 
Intercultural 
Education Program 
has 
been evaluated 
both 
in 
terms 
of 
educational and social 
impacts. 
In 
addition, there 
have 
been numerous 
consultation 
processes 
(see 
6.2) 
which 
have 
raised 
key 
issues 
that 
- 
32 
- 
Page  39
have 
been 
included 
into 
the 
project 
design. 
There 
are 
four 
main 
groups 
of 
issues 
identified which 
are 
being 
incorporated 
into 
the 
project 
design 
and 
are 
reflected 
in 
the 
Indigenous 
Peoples 
Strategy 
(see 
Annex 
11): 
Pedagogical practices 
in 
the classroom. 
Even though 
the 
curricular 
reform 
has 
had 
an 
impact 
in 
the 
classroom 
in 
terms 
of 
promoting 
a 
more 
horizontal 
and 
group-work  oriented 
learning, 
there 
is 
still 
evidence 
that 
teachers 
remain hierarchical 
and 
may 
show a 
discriminatory 
behavior, 
particularly 
to 
indigenous children. 
Bilingual 
materials 
are 
welcome 
by 
teachers, 
but 
further  training 
is 
needed 
to 
ensure 
full 
utilization 
in 
the 
classroom. 
The 
use 
of 
the mother tongue 
is 
common 
but 
is 
typically mixed 
with 
Spanish 
in 
a haphazard way. 
The 
reason 
for 
this 
may 
be 
the 
lack 
of 
materials 
for 
teaching 
Spanish 
as 
a 
second 
language 
and 
that 
parents 
press 
teachers 
to 
introduce 
Spanish 
as 
early 
as 
possible. 
There 
are 
indications that 
vernacular 
languages 
are 
being 
revalued 
socially 
thanks 
to 
their 
use 
in 
the classroom. 
The 
curricular 
reform 
and 
the 
limited 
introduction 
of 
materials and 
teacher 
training 
are 
still 
not 
reflected 
in 
student 
performance results 
where 
third 
grade 
children 
still 
have 
difficulties 
in 
reading 
and 
writing 
in 
their 
mother 
tongue. 
Children 
often 
need 
to 
share 
their schooling 
with 
chores 
in 
the 
house 
or 
farm, 
with 
the 
consequent 
absences, 
particularly during 
harvest periods. 
Community 
participation. 
Parents' 
participation 
has 
been 
traditionally 
limited 
to 
the 
contribution 
of 
manual labor 
in 
the 
conservation 
and 
rehabilitation 
of 
school infrastructure.  Whenever 
possible, parents 
also 
make 
financial 
contributions 
to 
purchase 
basic 
goods 
for 
the 
school. 
This 
limited 
participation 
results 
mainly 
because 
traditionally 
schools 
have 
kept 
parents 
aside. 
Thus, 
parents 
are 
not 
aware 
about 
the  objectives 
of 
the 
bilingual 
education 
and 
the 
advantages 
in 
the 
use 
of 
mother 
tongue 
in 
their 
children's 
education. 
The project 
will 
address these 
issues 
by 
creating 
flexibility 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
curriculum, 
promoting 
active 
and 
effective 
community participation. 
Training 
of 
teachers 
in 
multigrade classroom 
management 
skills, 
cultural 
awareness, 
planning 
and 
bilingual 
education (where pertinent) 
will 
also be 
key 
areas, 
linked 
to 
teacher 
incentives. 
Greater 
supervision and support 
to 
teachers 
will 
also 
receive 
prominent attention 
in 
the 
Project.  School 
autonomy actions 
will 
include 
community 
participation 
both 
as 
contributors 
to 
the 
educational 
process 
as 
well 
as 
a 
means 
for 
accountability. 
6.2 
Participatory Approach: 
How 
are 
key 
stakeholders 
participating 
in 
the 
project? 
There 
have been a number 
of 
consultation 
processes 
carried 
out 
in 
Peru 
in 
recent 
years, 
both 
as 
part 
of 
the 
project 
as 
well 
as 
GOP 
and 
Bank 
and 
GOP: 
1. 
Two 
consultations 
were 
carried  out 
with 
Andean 
and 
Amazonian 
People's 
in 
January 
and 
June 
1998. 
Participants 
included 
representatives 
from 
religious 
groups, 
community 
based 
organizations, 
community 
members 
and 
technicians. 
2. 
Beneficiary 
assessment. 
This 
was 
based 
on 
a survey 
applied 
to 
1,500 
teachers, 
classroom 
observation, and meetings 
with 
students 
and 
their 
parents. 
3. 
Poverty 
fora. 
Based 
on 
a 
joint 
effort 
between 
GOP, 
NGOs 
and 
International 
Organizations, Peru 
has 
been 
carrying 
out yearly Poverty 
fora 
addressing 
specific topics. 
Education 
was 
included 
in 
the 
1998 
Forum 
dealing 
with 
successful 
poverty alleviation 
experiences 
and 
in 
the 
1999 
Forum 
which 
discussed 
access 
to public 
services 
for 
the  poor. 
4. 
transition 
government 
(January 
- 
July 
2001) 
MED 
carried 
out 
this 
process 
which 
collected 
answers 
to 
38 
question 
to 
the 
population 
on 
issues 
related 
to 
quality 
of 
education, 
teachers, 
school 
autonomy, 
corruption 
etc. 
Responses 
came 
in 
from 
all 
regions 
in 
the 
country 
representing the 
voices 
of 
teachers, 
parents, students, 
and 
local 
governments. 
Two 
documents were 
published 
"Las 
Voces 
del 
Pais" 
and 
"Propuesta 
para 
un 
Acuerdo 
Nacional por 
la 
Educaci6n". 
As 
part 
of 
this 
consultation 
process, 
there 
were 
two 
main 
events 
that 
addressed 
specifically 
the 
issue 
of 
incorporating 
Intercultural 
and 
Bilingual 
Education 
in 
the Acuerdo Nacional. 
The 
first 
consultation 
had 
as 
its 
main 
theme 
education 
and 
the 
National 
Consultation 
with 
Indigenous 
Peoples. 
National 
consultation 
on 
education.

challenge 
of 
diversity 
(“La  Educacidn 
y 
10s 
Desafios 
de 
la 
Diversidad”). 
This 
process 
included 
representatives 
from 
indigenous organizations 
from 
the Andes 
and the 
Amazon 
basin, 
such 
as 
community 
federations, 
associations, 
regional 
organizations, 
bilingual 
teachers, 
NGOs, universities, 
intercultural 
and 
bilingual 
education 
experts, 
representatives 
from 
Congress 
and 
the 
Ombudsman’s 
offices 
and 
from 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Women 
and 
Human Development 
(PROMUDEH). 
The 
result 
of 
this 
consultation 
was 
published 
in 
a document 
called 
“Los 
Desafios 
de 
la 
Diversidad”. 
The 
second 
consultation 
process 
was 
focused 
on the 
issue 
of 
policies 
and 
strategies 
for 
Bilingual 
and 
Intercultural 
Education. 
The 
result 
of 
this 
consultation 
process, 
which 
includes 
as 
diverse 
a 
group 
as 
the 
previous 
one,  was 
the 
document 
“Politica  Nacional 
de 
Lenguas y 
Culturas 
en 
la 
Educacidn” 
(National  Policies 
on 
Languages and 
Cultures). 
6.3 
How 
does 
the 
project 
involve 
consultations 
or collaboration 
with 
NGOs 
or 
other 
civil 
society 
organizations? 
NGOs 
have 
had 
a 
key 
role 
in 
the development 
of 
the 
national 
rural 
education 
policy 
and 
of 
the 
bilingual 
intercultural 
education 
policy. 
Both 
policy 
documents  were 
developed  through 
workshops 
and 
consultation 
meetings 
with 
wide participation 
of 
NGOs 
involved 
in 
rural 
and 
bilingual 
education. 
In 
addition, 
NGOs 
have 
had 
a 
prominent 
role 
in 
the consultation 
processes 
described 
in 
6.2 
(see 
Annex 
11 
for 
the 
list 
of 
the main 
NGOs 
and 
civil 
society 
organizations). 
A 
Consultative Committee 
was 
established 
in 
May 
2001 
to 
promote 
the 
participation 
of civil 
society 
and 
beneficiaries 
of 
bilingual 
education. 
Members 
include 
representatives 
of 
the 
major national 
indigenous 
peoples 
organizations 
as 
well 
as 
academic 
institutions.  The Committee 
has 
met three 
times 
reviewing 
the 
bilingual 
strategic 
plan 
and 
the organization 
of 
the 
DINEBI. 
In 
addition 
DINEBI 
is 
represented 
in 
the 
“Comisidn 
Nacional 
de  Pueblos 
Andinos,  Amazdnicos 
y 
Afro 
Peruanos” 
(National 
Committee  on 
Andean and 
Amazon 
People’s) 
which 
is 
lead 
by 
the 
First 
Lady 
of 
Peru. 
During 
the preparation 
process, 
the 
Bank 
has 
had 
extensive contact 
with 
NGOs 
linked 
to 
rural 
education. 
NGOs 
have 
provided 
significant contributions 
to 
the 
design 
process 
in 
terms 
of 
what 
is 
feasible 
and 
the 
key 
areas 
that 
need 
to 
be 
addressed 
to improve quality 
of 
education 
in 
rural 
areas. 
It 
is 
expected that 
NGOs 
will 
contribute 
to 
project  implementation 
by 
providing 
teacher 
training 
and support 
to 
local 
networks. 
6.4 
What institutional 
arrangements have 
been 
provided 
to 
ensure 
the 
project 
achieves 
its 
social 
development outcomes? 
In 
order 
to 
address 
the 
main 
issues 
found 
with 
respect 
to bilingual 
and 
intercultural 
education, 
MED 
has 
developed 
a 
10 
step 
strategy 
which 
revolves  around strengthening 
on 
one 
hand, 
the 
links 
with 
the 
community, 
and, 
on 
the 
other, the 
pedagogical 
processes 
in 
the 
classroom: 
Community 
Consultation 
and 
Participation 
Program. 
MED 
has 
planned 
a 
continuous  consultation 
process 
on 
the 
design, 
execution 
and 
evaluation 
of 
the proposed 
strategies 
and 
activities. 
This 
process 
will 
complement 
other 
consultation 
processes 
already 
included 
in 
the 
project 
design 
such 
as 
the School 
Councils 
and 
Network 
Councils. 
The 
main 
instruments 
for 
the consultation 
process 
will 
include 
“Mesas 
de 
DiBlogo”, 
Regional  Consultative  Councils,  indigenous 
and 
bilingual 
teachers 
conferences, 
and 
intercultural 
events 
directed 
to 
students, 
teachers 
and 
parents. 
A 
strong dissemination 
program 
is 
also 
planned 
in 
order 
to 
raise 
awareness 
to 
the parents 
on the value 
of 
the 
bilingual 
program, 
the 
need 
for 
and 
value 
of 
intercultural 
education 
and 
promotion 
of 
self-esteem. 
Strengthening Pedagogical 
Processes. 
DINEBI 
has 
already produced materials 
in 
15 
Andean  and 
Amazon basin 
languages 
for 
math,  language, 
social  and natural 
sciences, 
and 
Spanish 
as 
a 
second 
language. 
The 
strategy 
calls 
for 
further 
validation 
and 
development 
of 
new complementary materials 
for 
-34- 
Page  41
students 
and self-paced 
teachers. 
Secondly, the strategy aims 
at 
strengthening pre-service 
and 
in-service 
teacher 
training 
on 
bilingual 
and 
multigrade 
education. 
Thirdly, 
research studies 
will 
be 
promoted 
on 
languages 
and 
culture 
of 
a number 
of 
indigenous 
peoples 
on 
numeric 
systems, 
cognitive 
process 
development, 
children’s 
ethnography 
and 
child 
rearing practices. 
Finally, 
the school 
calendar 
will 
be 
adapted 
to 
the 
agricultural 
cycle. 
6.5 
How 
will 
the 
project 
monitor 
performance 
in 
terms 
of 
social development 
outcomes? 
MED 
has 
developed a 
number 
of 
indicators  aimed 
at 
measuring the  implementation 
success 
of 
the 
strategy and 
has 
identified, 
the 
instruments 
to 
be 
used. 
Indicators 
will 
assess 
community participation, 
pedagogical 
processes 
and 
dissemination. 
DINEBI 
will 
have  the 
overall 
responsibility 
for 
the 
performance 
monitoring 
and 
will 
be 
assisted 
by 
the 
Bilingual 
specialists 
in 
MEDs 
Regional 
Offices 
and 
by 
the 
external 
teacher 
training 
institutions. 
Sources 
of

Sustainability and 
Risks 
1. 
Sustainability: 
The project 
will 
result 
in 
a 
significant 
increase 
in 
expenditures 
in 
rural 
areas 
(4.3 
percent). 
However, 
this 
increase 
implies 
a very 
small overall 
increase 
in 
overall 
education education expenditure 
(less 
than 
1 
percent). 
This 
targeted investment 
is 
supported 
by 
National 
policy 
and 
education 
as 
stated 
in 
the 
National 
Agreement 
which 
calls 
from 
increase 
from 
2.5 
to 
6 
percent 
of 
GDP 
until 
2012.

Detailed Project Description 
PERU: 
Rural Education Project 
The 
Project-Phase 
I 
of 
a 
three 
phase 
program- 
aims 
to 
support 
the 
Peruvian government 
in 
improving 
basic 
education 
quality 
and 
reducing education disparities between 
rural 
and 
urban 
areas. 
The objective 
will 
be 
achieved 
by: 
(a) 
increasing 
access 
to 
and 
completion 
rates 
in 
rural 
schools; 
(b) 
improving 
teachers 
development 
and 
performance, and 
upgrading 
schoolklassroom learning 
environment, 
and 
teachers’ 
performance;  and 
(c) 
fostering  closer-to-school 
and 
learning 
oriented 
management  strategies. 
The 
expected 
end 
result 
would 
be 
more 
and 
better 
learning 
outcomes 
for 
an 
increased 
number 
of 
rural 
school 
children. 
Project implementation 
strategy 
will 
be 
two-pronged, to: 
(a) 
strengthen and 
expand 
selected 
activities 
where 
prior 
albeit exploratory implementation 
has 
proven 
successful, 
as 
for 
example 
bilingual 
education 
materials 
and 
teacher 
training; 
and 
(b) 
include innovative 
elements that have 
had 
limited 
implementation 
and 
whose 
success has 
not 
been 
fully 
demonstrated, such 
as 
the distance 
secondary 
education program. 
Implementation 
of 
these 
actions 
will 
be 
carried  out 
in 
11 
primarily 
rural 
departments 
(Amazonas, 
Ancash, 
Ayacucho, 
Cajamarca, Cusco, 
Huancavelica, 
Loreto, 
Piura, 
Puno, 
San 
Martin, 
and 
Ucayali) 
and 
within 
at 
least 
290 
rural 
school networks.

for 
Rural 
Children 
(1 
1.2 
percent 
of 
total 
Project 
cost) 
Objective. 
The key objective 
of 
this 
component 
is 
to 
increase 
access 
to 
quality initial, 
preschool 
and 
secondary 
education 
for 
rural 
children 
who 
have 
been 
excluded 
from 
these  services. 
In 
spite 
of 
pioneering 
ECD 
initiatives 
in 
the 
1960s, 
Peru 
shows 
today 
a 
surprisingly 
low 
coverage 
rate 
for 
the 
0-2 
year-old group (around 
3 
percent nationwide, 
and 
1 
percent 
in 
rural 
areas), 
and the 
3-5 
year-old group (42 
percent 
nationally, 
and 
36 
percent 
in 
rural 
areas). 
Project 
strategies 
include 
the 
following 
demand-based 
initiatives: 
(a) 
initial 
and 
preschool education programs 
designed 
to 
promote 
a 
balanced early 
childhood 
development  (ECD); 
and 
(b) 
distance 
secondary 
education  programs 
through 
the 
application 
of 
cost-effective 
information 
and communication 
technologies. 
1.1 
Access 
to 
Quality 
Initial 
Education 
and 
Preschool 
Education 
(US$2.71 
million) 
Objective. 
This 
sub-component 
is 
designed 
to 
expand 
access 
of 
young 
rural 
children 
(0-5 
years 
old) 
to 
a 
variety 
of 
existing or 
brand-new 
ECD 
programs. 
These 
programs 
aim 
at 
both 
meeting 
young children’s 
educational 
and 
psychological 
needs 
and 
making them 
ready 
for 
primary 
and 
further 
school 
achievement. 
Implementation 
arrangements. 
Two 
distinct 
groups 
are addressed 
under: 
(a) 
the 
0 
through 
2-years 
old 
children participating 
in 
ECD 
programs; and 
(b) 
the 
3-5 
year-old group 
being 
prepared 
(at 
preschool) 
for 
the 
adequate 
entry 
to formal 
primary 
schooling. 
MED 
relative 
success 
with 
the 
latter 
group 
is 
largely 
due 
to 
the 
development 
of 
the 
Non-formal 
Initial 
Education 
Program (PRONOEI) 
and 
the 
Initial 
Education 
Centers (CEO.

, 
For 
children 
0-2 
years  old, 
a 
non-formal 
approach 
will 
be 
implemented 
in 
which 
children 
will 
be 
educated 
along 
with 
their 
parents 
and 
siblings 
within 
a 
family 
and 
community 
framework. 
Services 
will 
be 
delivered 
by 
trained community 
educators 
(animadoras). 
Wherever relevant, community 
educators 
fluent 
in 
the 
local 
vemacular 
languages 
will 
be 
trained 
for 
the 
provision 
of 
Initial 
Education. 
During 
Phase 
I, 
three models 
of 
Initial 
Education 
will 
be validated, 
depending 
on 
the 
socio-cultural 
and 
demographic 
characteristics 
of 
the communities, 
as 
well 
as 
their 
preferences. 
The 
first 
one 
will 
function 
with 
one 
animudora, 
who 
will 
visit 
each 
house once 
a 
week, 
covering 
about 
10 
children. 
The 
second 
model 
will 
offer 
educational 
and 
recreational 
services 
through 
animadoras, 
benefiting 
approximately 
10 
children 
daily 
at 
a 
site 
designated 
for 
this 
purpose 
by 
the 
community. 
The 
third 
model, 
named 
family 
education, 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
by 
one 
animadora 
in 
charge 
of 
close 
to 
30 families 
(groups 
of 
parents) 
each 
and 
will 
focus on the improvement 
of 
child-rearing 
practices. 
Active family 
participation 
is 
a 
key 
factor 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
these 
strategies. 
Through  the 
above 
mentioned 
programs, 
this 
sub-component 
seeks 
to 
benefit 
approximately 
30,000 
children 
with 
2,000 
animadoras. 
The program would, 
then, 
increase coverage 
from 
3.9 
percent 
to 
5.7 
percent 
at 
the 
national 
level.  The 
following 
will 
be 
carried  out 
during 
the 
first 
year 
of 
project 
implementation: 
(a) 
baseline 
studies; 
(b) 
studies 
of 
rural 
families' 
upbringing 
practices; 
(c) 
detailed 
designing 
of 
the 
three 
models; 
(d) 
preparation 
of 
manuals 
for 
animadoras, 
teaching 
coordinators, and 
parents; 
(e) 
printing 
and 
distribution 
of 
manuals; 
(f) 
production 
and 
reproduction 
of 
pertaining 
cassettes 
and videos; 
(8) 
selection 
and 
acquisition 
of 
educational materials 
for 
children; 
and, 
(h) 
designing 
and 
printing 
of 
training 
module 
for 
animudoras 
and 
teaching coordinators. 
During 
the 
second and 
third 
years, 
the respective models 
will 
be 
implemented 
and 
evaluated 
in 
all 
the 
networks 
within 
the 
11 
departments. 
Training 
for 
animadoras 
and 
teaching coordinators 
will 
start 
the 
second 
year. 
During 
Phase 
IT, 
it 
is 
estimated that 
these 
models 
(with 
the 
necessary 
adjustments) 
will 
benefit 
a 
total 
of 
75,000 
children 
(8.3 
percent 
coverage 
at 
the 
national 
level), 
and 
Phase 
III 
will 
benefit 
135,000 
children. 
This 
sub-component 
seeks 
to 
increase coverage 
from 
3.9 
percent 
to 
12 
percent 
at 
the 
national 
level, 
primarily 
benefiting 
indigenous communities through 
their 
mother 
tongues. 
For 
children 
3-5 
years 
old, 
an 
intervention combining 
formal 
and 
non-formal 
approaches 
will 
be 
implemented. Wherever 
relevant, 
community 
educators 
fluent 
in 
the 
local 
vemacular 
languages 
will 
be 
trained 
for 
the 
provision 
of 
Initial 
Education 
and the 
introduction 
of 
children 
to 
Spanish. 
Services 
will 
be 
implemented 
by 
trained 
animudoras, 
teachers  and 
teaching  coordinators  and 
sub-central 
office 
specialists. 
During 
Phase 
I, 
this 
sub-component 
will 
be 
implemented 
using 
two 
models experimented 
in 
the 
country 
with 
a 
current 
coverage 
of 
36 
percent 
in 
rural 
areas at 
the 
national level. 
The 
CEI 
and 
PRONOEI 
models 
will 
be  strengthened 
through: 
(a) 
improvement 
of 
existing 
educational 
material 
and 
provision 
of 
additional 
material; 
(b) 
training 
Initial 
Education 
teachers 
(CEIs) 
and 
animadoras 
(PRONOEIs), 
teaching 
coordinators 
and 
specialists 
from 
intermediate educational 
administrative 
agencies;  (c) 
creation 
of 
a 
weekly pedagogical 
support mechanism 
through 
itinerant 
teams 
from 
the 
ISPs; 
(d) 
specialized 
on-going 
technical 
assistance 
for 
animudoras 
and 
educators; 
(e) 
teaching 
in 
the 
children's 
mother tongue and 
introduction 
to 
Spanish 
as 
a 
second language; 
(f) 
recovery 
of 
local 
experiences 
relevant 
to 
socialization 
and 
upbringing 
to 
feed 
these 
models; 
and 
(8) 
community education programs 
to 
increase 
and 
qualify 
the 
demand. 
These 
actions 
seek 
to 
improve 
both 
pedagogical and 
management 
practices.

The 
sub-component 
includes 
the 
creation 
of 
300 new PRONOEIs that 
will 
benefit approximately 
4,500 
children. 
Upon finalizing 
Phase 
I, 
it 
is 
expected 
that 
existing PRONOEI 
coverage 
will 
increase 
to 
a 
total 
of 
14,000 
children 
and 
CEI 
coverage 
will 
increase 
to 
24,000, 
representing 
a 
growth 
in 
coverage 
of 
42,500, 
that 
is 
from 
36 
percent 
to 
37.3 
percent 
for 
this 
age 
group. 
During 
Phase 
I, 
it 
is 
expected that 
this 
sub-component 
will 
benefit 
through 
intercultural-bilingual 
education 
a 
total 
of 
19,000 
indigenous 
children 
in 
the  3-5 
age 
group 
within 
at 
least 
200 networks, 
representing 
17 percent 
of 
the 
indigenous 
children population 
in 
rural 
areas. 
During 
Phase 
II, 
1,000 
new PRONOEIs 
will 
be 
created 
to 
benefit 
approximately 
15,000 
new children. 
Upon 
finalizing 
this 
phase 
it 
is 
expected 
that 
45,000 
children 
will 
benefit, representing approximately 
43 
percent 
coverage. 
Phase 
III 
contemplates 
the creation 
of 
2,000 
new PRONOEIs 
with 
approximately 
30,000 
new 
children 
to 
benefit 
100,000 
children who 
represent 
close 
to 
57 
percent 
coverage. 
The 
implementation 
of 
this 
sub-component 
requires 
carrying 
out 
several 
studies 
to 
provide 
guidance 
in 
decision making. 
It 
includes: 
(a) 
a 
state 
of 
the 
art 
of 
current education 
services 
provided 
for 
the 
under-six 
age 
group 
in 
rural 
areas; 
(b) 
strengths 
and 
weaknesses 
of 
the 
formal 
and 
non-formal 
experiences 
linking 
preschool 
and 
primary 
levels, 
(c) 
sociolinguistic 
studies 
with 
indigenous 
children 
under 
six 
years 
of 
age; 
and 
(d) 
systematization 
of 
innovative national 
and 
international 
experiences 
in 
initial 
education. 
Financing. 
The 
sub-component 
will 
finance: 
(a) 
training 
of 
animadoras 
and 
teaching coordinators; 
(b) 
activities 
of 
the 
itinerant 
teams; 
(c) 
community education 
programs; 
(d) 
design and 
validation 
of 
three 
Initial 
Education 
models: 
(e) 
preparation and 
printing 
of 
manuals 
for 
animadorus 
and parents; 
(f) 
acquisition 
of 
educational 
materials, 
including 
cassettes 
and videos; and 
(g) 
studies. 
1.2 
Secondary Distance 
Education 
(US$7.83 
million) 
Objective. 
This 
sub-component 
is 
designed 
to 
provide 
technical 
support 
to 
MEDs 
effort 
seeking 
alternative 
models 
for 
access 
to 
secondary 
education 
in 
selected 
rural 
areas 
through 
the 
application 
of 
cost-effective 
information 
and 
communication technologies. 
A 
Phase 
I 
enrollment 
of 
5,000 
students, 
a 
14 
percent increase 
in 
coverage 
as 
compared 
to 
the 2002 
rates 
in 
the target 
areas, 
is 
expected. 
Secondary 
education 
is 
compulsory 
in 
Peru 
and 
has 
become 
part 
of 
the 
basic

structure. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
increased 
six-year 
primary 
education 
availability, 
effectiveness 
and 
efficiency 
in 
recent 
years, 
more 
and more Peruvian 
students 
are 
looking for 
secondary 
education. 
In 
rural 
areas, 
however, 
access 
to 
post-primary 
schooling,  even 
the 
five-year 
basic 
secondary 
education, 
is 
made 
particularly 
difficult, 
especially 
for 
those 
groups 
who 
have 
to 
face 
either 
geographic 
constraints 
in 
the 
Andean mountains 
or 
sheer 
remoteness 
in 
the 
Amazon forest. 
Any 
impact-oriented 
solution 
must 
identify 
creative 
strategies 
other 
than 
traditional 
school delivery. 
Zmplementation

Phase 
I 
will 
be 
a 
piloting, 
experimenting 
and 
comparative 
assessment 
segment. 
The focus 
will 
be on testing 
and 
gauging 
several 
secondary 
education models 
in 
order 
to 
determine 
the 
cost-effective  solutions that  better 
fit 
each 
particular 
rural 
environment 
of 
Peru. 
The 
curriculum 
contents 
of 
the 
three models 
(including 
the 
presence 
one) 
must 
be the 
same. 
Two 
models 
will 
be 
under consideration: 
(a) 
Model 
A 
- 
The 
strategy adopted 
by 
the 
Pilot 
Distance 
Education 
Centers 
(CPED) 
uses

and 
provides pedagogical 
support 
to

MED 
is 
currently implementing 
this 
model 
in 
101 
CPEDs 
throughout 
Peru. 
For 
the 
evaluation, 
a representative 
sample 
will 
be 
selected 
for 
comparison 
purposes; 
and 
(b) 
Model 
B, 
proposed 
by 
MED 
and 
currently 
under 
design, 
is 
a 
more complex instrument 
involving: 
(i) 
Model 
A; 
(ii) 
satellite-linked 
VSAT 
(Very 
Small 
Aperture 
Terminal) 
bidirectional 
channels 
to 
facilitate 
real-time communication between the 
students 
and a 
tutor 
located 
at 
the 
emitting 
station, 
printed 
handbooks, videos, 
computer, 
CD-ROM, 
and 
Internet 
access. 
These 
two 
models 
will 
be 
compared 
with 
each 
other 
and 
with 
secondary  presence 
schools 
according 
to 
indicators 
showing 
students’ 
attitudinal 
and 
behavioral 
features 
associated 
with 
the 
interaction 
with 
each 
specific 
delivery 
model, 
including: 
(i) 
satisfaction 
with 
the program, 
knowledge 
and other 
skills 
acquired, 
frustration 
faced; 
(ii) 
satisfaction 
with 
the 
school 
environment, educational 
resources 
and 
technologies 
used; 
and 
(iii) 
student 
performance 
and achievement. 
A 
detailed 
and 
participatory 
analysis 
of 
this 
comparative 
assessment 
will 
help 
determine 
the 
model 
or 
models 
for 
the 
expansion 
of 
the 
access 
to 
basic 
secondary 
education 
in 
rural 
Peru 
during 
Phases 
II 
and 
III. 
Prior  to 
implementation,  the  models 
will 
be  validated  through 
a 
consultative 
process, 
and 
the 
detailed implementation 
plan 
will 
be 
reviewed 
jointly 
with 
the 
World 
Bank. 
The 
pilot 
will 
be 
implemented gradually 
during 
the three-year 
period 
up 
to 
a 
total 
of 
116 
schools 
which 
will 
be located 
at 
the 
center 
of 
the 
rural 
networks 
which 
do not 
have 
secondary 
schools. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
facilities 
will 
also 
be 
used 
for 
teacher 
training 
and 
possibly enrichment 
of 
upper 
primary 
school 
students. 
The program 
will 
adopt 
the 
same 
basic 
curriculum 
officially 
established 
for 
the  regular 
secondary 
education, 
aiming 
at 
promoting 
meaningful, 
autonomous 
and 
long-lasting 
students’, 
tutors’ 
and 
community  learning 
processes 
and 
outcomes, 
with 
special  consideration 
to 
linguistic 
and 
cultural 
characteristics 
of 
the 
beneficiary 
community, specifically,  concerning 
treatment 
of 
Spanish 
as 
a 
second

are 
currently being reviewed 
under

US$63.58 
million 
Improving 
Quality 
in 
Rural 
Schools 
(67.5 
percent 
of 
total 
Project 
cost) 
Objective. 
This 
component 
focuses 
on 
the 
quality 
of 
teaching and 
learning 
processes 
and results 
in 
primary 
and 
secondary 
schools 
of 
the targeted 
rural 
areas, 
through three 
sub-components: 
(a) 
a 
program 
of 
continuous professional development 
for 
teachers; 
(b) 
the development 
and 
distribution 
of 
multigrade 
and 
bilingual 
instructional 
materials; 
and 
(c) 
classroom infrastructure 
rehabilitation. 
2.1 
Continuous Teacher 
Development 
System 
(CTDS) 
(US$24.86 
million) 
Objective. 
This 
sub-component 
will 
upgrade 
teachers’ 
educational  and  professional 
quality 
and 
performance 
by: 
(a) 
introducing 
a 
continuous 
teacher 
development 
system 
designed 
to 
work 
as 
an 
operational 
concept 
integrating 
pre-service 
and 
in-service 
phases 
thereby 
replacing 
the dichotomous and 
dysfunctional 
teacher 
training 
mechanisms adopted 
so 
far; 
and 
(b) 
training 
the 
initial, 
primary 
and 
secondary 
school 
teachers 
and 
teacher 
trainers 
required 
for 
the 
adequate 
project implementation 
in 
the 
target 
Project 
areas.

Implementation 
arrangements. 
A 
reshaped 
initial 
and 
pre-service 
teacher 
training 
phase 
will 
take 
place 
at 
the 
teacher 
training  institutions 
in 
order 
to  establish a  theoretical 
and 
practical 
foundation 
for 
professional 
identification 
(tronco 
comlin), 
basic 
enough 
to 
branch 
out 
into 
later 
undergraduate 
specialization 
areas 
and 
pave 
the 
ground 
for 
meaningful in-service development 
programs. 
To 
this 
end, 
the 
sub-component 
will: 
(a) 
redefine 
the pre-service 
teacher 
training curriculum 
(structure, 
modalities, 
methodologies, 
length 
and management) and 
establish 
new 
training 
and performance 
standards; 
(b) 
set 
up 
an 
ISP 
accreditation 
system 
to 
assure 
excellence 
in 
initial 
teacher 
training 
preparation, 
and 
promote a 
rational 
and 
efficient 
training 
supply 
along 
with 
a 
diversification 
of 
redundant 
ISP. 
Approximately 
75 
percent 
of 
the 
120 
public 
ISP 
in 
existence 
will 
focus 
in 
three 
main 
roles: pre-service 
teacher 
training, 
in-service 
teacher 
training 
(25)  and 
“Amauta 
Centers” 
(six, 
see 
below). 
Other 
ISP 
will 
undergo a 
transformation 
process, 
particularly 
those 
showing 
sluggish 
records; (c) 
offer 
specialized 
training 
to 
600 
teacher 
trainers 
of 
the 
predominantly 
rural 
and 
accredited 
ISP 
closely 
associated 
with 
teacher 
training 
reform; 
and 
(d) 
provide 
access 
to 
updated 
information, 
and 
familiarity 
with 
the 
best 
national  and 
international 
teacher 
training 
practices through 
the 
financing 
of 
15 
competitive ISP-initiated innovation 
projects 
at 
an 
estimated 
US$5.000 
unit 
cost. 
By 
year 
2007, 
the 
first 
freshman cohort 
of 
students 
will 
be 
enrolled 
in 
the 
newly 
reorganized 
ISP. 
In-service 
programs 
make 
with 
pre-service 
and 
initial 
activities a 
continuum 
of 
teacher 
training 
under 
the 
CTDS 
concept. 
The 
new in-service 
programs, 
contrary 
to 
the 
reactive 
and 
supply-side 
nature 
of 
the 
traditional 
capacitacidn 
approach, 
will 
be 
pro-active 
and  demand-based. 
The 
sub-component 
will 
therefore: 
(a) 
help 
set 
in 
motion 
six 
(three 
in 
2004 and three 
in 
2005) 
regional 
“Amauta” 
Teachers 
Professional Development 
Centers, 
linked 
to 
the 
National 
Teacher 
Training 
Directorate (DINFOCAD). 
These 
centers 
will 
either 
occupy 
facilities  formerly 
used 
by 
terminated 
ISP 
or 
share 
space 
with 
active 
ones. 
The 
“Amauta” 
Centers 
will 
be located 
in 
strategic 
demand-intensive 
hubs to: 
(i) 
plan, 
coordinate, 
monitor 
and evaluate 
regional 
in-service 
training 
activities; 
(ii) 
organize 
regional 
in-service 
teacher 
training 
demand 
expressed 
by 
schools and 
school networks 
and 
help 
identify 
teacher 
training institutions 
able 
to 
address 
such 
demands; 
and 
(iii) 
cooperate 
with 
technical 
assistance 
to 
schools, 
school 
networks 
and 
MED 
offices; 
(b) 
coordinate teaching 
methods, 
multigrade 
and 
bilingual 
education 
training 
programs 
for 
a 
total 
of 
19,800 
rural 
teachers 
(1000 pre-school, 
3800 
primary multigrade 
and 
15,000 
bilingual), 
2000 
animudoras 
for 
the 
ECD 
program,  1400 
PRONOEI 
animadorus, 
and 
250 
secondary 
education 
tutors, 
as 
well 
as 
managers 
and 
facilitators,  carried  out 
in 
selected and 
monitored 
teacher 
training 
institutions. 
The 
selection 
process 
of 
the 
ISP 
to 
be 
associated 
with 
the in-service programs 
will 
start 
with 
those 
located 
in 
the 
area 
covered 
by 
the 290 school networks; 
and (c) 
develop social marketing 
activities 
designed 
to 
promote appreciation 
toward 
and 
support 
for 
teaching 
career and 
profession 
among 
a 
variety 
of 
active 
stakeholders 
both 
in 
society-at-large 
and 
the 
educational community. 
Financing. 
The Project 
would 
finance 
meetings, 
consulting 
and materials 
needed 
to: 
(a) 
design 
the 
Continuous 
Teacher 
Development 
System, 
(b) 
redefine 
the 
pre-service 
curriculum 
and 
institutional 
setting;  (c) 
lay 
out 
and 
strengthen 
the 
six 
regional 
“Amauta” 
Centers; 
(d) 
train 
600 
ISP 
teacher 
trainers, 
and 
19,800 
rural 
teachers; 
and 
(e) 
plan 
and 
implement 
the 
social 
marketing 
program. 
2.2 
Curriculum 
Adjustment Provision 
of 
Educational 
Materials 
(US$9.09 
million) 
Objective. 
This 
sub-component 
seeks 
to 
contribute 
to 
quality 
improvement 
of 
rural 
primary 
schooling, 
including 
areas 
in 
which 
one 
or 
more  indigenous 
languages  are 
predominantly 
spoken. 
Two 
complementary 
models 
will 
be 
implemented: 
(a) 
delivery 
at 
national 
level 
of 
already experimented 
bilingual 
educational materials prepared 
by 
the 
MED, 
(b) 
the 
design and 
validation 
within 
the 
networks 
of 
a new educational proposal 
for 
the 
rural 
areas, 
aiming 
at 
more 
pertinent 
pedagogical 
service, 
through

high 
quality 
self-paced 
learning materials and 
teacher manuals 
to 
support 
multigrade 
instruction 
and 
bilingual 
education. 
In 
both 
cases, 
rural 
indigenous vemacular-speaking 
children 
and 
Spanish-speaking 
children 
will 
be 
benefited 
by 
the 
project. 
Teacher 
training 
activities 
will 
also 
be 
included 
in 
both 
modalities. 
Although 
90 
percent 
of 
the 
schools 
in 
rural 
areas 
in 
Peru 
are 
multigrade, 
they 
have 
never 
been 
supplied 
with 
appropriately 
designed 
materials 
to 
support 
multigrade 
teaching 
or 
bilingual 
instruction. 
Colombia’s 
Escuela 
Nueva 
and 
similar 
programs 
in 
other countries 
have demonstrated 
that supplying 
children 
in 
rural 
areas 
with 
self-paced 
learning materials and other classroom materials 
(rincones 
de 
lectura, 
for 
instance) 
that 
permit 
teachers 
to 
engage 
in 
effective  multigrade instruction 
results 
in 
higher 
student 
leaming 
and 
lower repetition 
rates. 
Self-paced 
learning 
materials 
have also been associated 
with 
lower 
dropout 
among 
rural 
students, because 
they 
allow rural 
children 
to 
make 
continued 
academic 
progress 
despite 
discontinuous 
school 
attendance, 
due 
to 
families’ 
needs, 
farm 
labor, 
illnesses, 
or 
other 
disruptions. 
Similarly, 
research 
on 
indigenous communities 
in 
Guatemala, 
Bolivia 
and 
elsewhere 
has 
shown 
that supporting indigenous 
children 
with 
bilingual 
instructional 
materials 
in 
the 
first 
schooling 
years 
helps 
lower 
repetition 
and 
dropout 
rates 
and boosts 
learning 
in 
all 
subjects. 
Zmplementation 
arrangements. 
For 
rural 
Spanish-speaking 
students, 
the  Project  includes 
the 
validation 
and implementation 
within 
the 
networks 
of 
a 
self-paced 
rural 
educational 
model 
which allows 
students 
to 
progress 
according 
to 
their 
own individual rhythm 
and 
leaming 
capacity, 
and 
not 
according 
to 
chronological 
criteria. 
During 
Phase 
I, 
in 
2004 
and 
2005, 
this 
new 
proposal 
will 
be  validated  along 
with 
the 
respective 
self-paced 
educational materials 
for 
the 
first 
cycle 
(grades  1-2) 
of 
primary 
educations. 
This 
pilot 
study 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
in 
four 
Spanish-speaking 
networks. 
In 
2007, 
the proposal 
and 
materials 
for 
the 
first 
cycle 
will 
be 
generalized, 
benefiting 
all 
of 
the 
students 
in 
the 
2 10 
remaining 
Spanish-speaking 
networks. 
In 
the 
same 
year, 
the 
proposal 
and 
materials 
for 
the 
second 
cycle 
(grades 3-4) 
will 
be 
validated. 
In 
2007, 
the 
second 
cycle 
will 
be 
generalized and 
the 
third 
will 
be validated. 
In 
this 
progression, 
in 
2008, 
the 
whole 
of 
rural 
primary 
education 
will 
have 
been 
covered. 
The 
Spanish-speaking 
students 
nationwide 
will 
continue 
receiving 
the materials 
packages 
currently financed 
and 
distributed 
by 
h4ED. 
For 
indigenous 
vernacular-speaking 
students, 
the  sub-component considers 
educational service 
at 
national 
level to 
students 
belonging 
to 
14 
different 
indigenous 
groups, 
through 
their 
respective mother 
tongues 
and 
the teaching 
of 
Spanish 
as 
a 
second language. 
Within 
the 
scope 
of 
the Project, 
the 
following 
materials 
will 
be 
distributed: 
(a) 
previously validated 
workbooks 
(three 
per 
student) 
in 
language 
and 
communication for 
the 
indigenous 
languages, 
Spanish 
as 
a 
second language 
and mathematics 
for 
the six 
grades 
of 
primary 
education; 
(b) 
corresponding 
teachers  guides; 
(c) 
bilingual 
classroom 
libraries 
(18,000); 
and 
(d) 
sets 
of 
complementary educational materials. 
During 
Phase 
I, 
approximately 
15,000 
teachers 
working 
with 
375,000 
children 
will 
be 
trained 
in 
the 
use 
of 
these 
materials. 
It 
is 
estimated that 
through 
these 
activities 
69 
percent 
of 
the vernacular-speaking indigenous 
rural 
population 
at 
primary 
level 
will 
be 
covered. 
In 
the 
selected 
networks, 
the 
students 
and 
teachers 
of 
at 
least 150 networks, representing 
the 
total 
number 
of 
networks 
in 
indigenous 
areas 
will 
benefit 
from 
the program. 
In 
these 
areas, 
nine different 
indigenous 
languages are spoken 
(three 
Amazonian 
languages, 
four 
Quechua varieties,  and Aymara); 
and 
90,000 
students 
and 
4,000 teachers 
will 
be 
benefited 
by 
a 
new 
self-paced 
rural 
education 
model 
which 
aims 
to 
account 
for 
curriculum 
diversification 
and 
the 
multigrade 
condition 
of 
the 
schools 
of 
the 
area.

During 
Phase 
I, 
in 
2004 and 
2007, 
the 
new self-paced 
learning 
proposal and materials 
for 
the 
first 
cycle 
of 
primary 
education 
will 
be 
validated. 
This 
will 
be done 
in 
two 
pilot 
networks and 
working 
with two 
indigenous 
languages (an 
Andean language and 
an 
Amazonian 
one). 
On 
this 
basis, 
the proposal 
will 
be 
generalized 
in 
2007 
to 
attend 
all 
of 
the 
schools, teachers 
and 
students 
in 
the 
first 
cycle 
where 
these 
two 
languages are 
spoken. 
In 
2007, 
the 
proposal 
and 
materials 
for 
the 
second 
cycle 
will 
be 
validated 
in 
these 
two 
languages. 
During 
Phase 
It, 
the experiences 
will 
be extended 
to 
other indigenous 
languages 
and 
areas. 
Similarly, 
this 
sub-component 
seeks 
to 
reach 
all 
of 
the  communities 
attended 
with 
information 
and 
communication materials 
depicting 
the 
advantages 
of 
the 
use 
of 
indigenous 
languages 
in 
the 
education 
of 
their 
children 
and 
particularly 
the 
importance 
of 
educating indigenous 
girls. 
To 
achieve 
this 
aim, 
radio 
and 
television 
messages 
and 
spots 
will 
be produced 
and 
widely 
disseminated 
as 
well 
as 
posters, 
leaflets 
and other 
means 
of 
communication. 
The 
participation 
of 
parents 
and 
community 
members 
will 
be 
promoted 
so 
as 
to 
improve the 
quality 
of 
the educational 
services rendered, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
quality 
of 
school 
management 
in 
rural 
areas. 
To 
support 
all 
of 
the 
activities 
of 
this 
sub-component, several studies 
will 
be 
carried 
out. 
Among 
others, 
the 
following 
have 
been 
considered: 
(a) 
systematization 
of 
knowledge,  practices 
and 
histories 
of 
indigenous,  Andean  and 
Amazonian 
peoples 
in 
order 
to 
provide 
new 
and 
enriched 
inputs 
for 
the 
curriculum 
diversification 
processes 
and 
for 
educational 
material 
development; 
and 
(b) 
ethnographic 
studies 
related 
to 
classroom 
work 
as 
well 
as 
rural 
children 
games 
and 
use 
of 
free time. 
During 
Phase 
I, 
the sub-component 
will 
also prepare, 
validate and massively 
distribute 
a 
teachers 
guide 
on how to 
take 
advantage 
of 
cultural diversity 
in 
the classroom 
(interculturalidad). 
All 
of 
the 
teachers 
in 
the 
selected 
networks 
will 
receive 
this 
guide. 
The 
same 
will 
occur 
with 
a 
specially 
prepared 
teachers 
guide 
on 
multigrade 
classrooms 
in 
bilingual 
and Spanish-speaking 
areas. 
This 
guide 
will 
be 
validated 
during 
Phase 
I, 
and 
will 
be generalized 
in 
all 
networks starting 
in 
2005. 
Financing. 
The 
project 
will 
finance: 
(a) 
workbooks 
in 
indigenous 
languages; 
(b) 
bilingual 
classroom 
libraries; 
(c) 
complementary educational material; 
(d) 
educational 
games; 
(e) 
a 
set 
of 
materials 
for 
teaching 
Spanish 
as 
a 
second 
language 
(workbooks, 
cassettes, 
posters, 
and 
interactive 
flashcards); 
(f) 
a 
set 
of 
bilingual 
teachers 
guides and manuals; 
(g) 
a 
set 
of 
worktools;  and 
(h) 
learning 
modules 
and 
reference texts 
for 
the self-paced 
learning 
in 
the 
project 
areas. 
2.3 
Rehabilitation 
and 
Equipping 
of 
Rural 
Schools 
(US$29.63 
million) 
Objective. 
This 
sub-component 
will 
upgrade 
the 
quality 
of 
education  environment  through  the 
construction 
of 
schools 
and 
provision 
of 
furniture 
and 
equipment 
in 
order 
to 
enrich 
classrooms and 
other 
educational 
and 
administrative 
spaces. 
These 
will 
benefit 
35,000 
children 
in 
540 
schools 
located 
in 
poor 
rural 
areas 
of 
the 
three 
climatic 
regions 
of 
Peru. These 
schools 
make 
up 
116 
primary-school 
networks 
in 
11 
departments 
of 
the 
country. 
Implementation arrangements. 
The 
Project 
would 
target 
the 
refurbishment 
of 
up 
to 
1,900 
classrooms 
and 
approximately 
1,480 
complementary 
facilities 
(such 
as 
administrative 
offices,  small 
cooking 
facilities, 
sanitary 
services, 
etc) 
in 
existing 
schools 
according 
to 
prototypes 
agreed 
with 
the Bank. 
The 
Social Investment and Compensation 
Fund 
(FONCODES) 
will 
be the executing 
agency 
for 
all 
construction work. 
During 
appraisal the 
project cycle 
to 
be 
followed 
was 
reviewed 
and 
agreed 
upon.

MED, 
through the Education Infrastructure 
Office 
(OINFE), 
would 
perform 
random inspection 
of 
works. 
The 
mD 
PCU 
will 
carry  out 
the 
general 
coordination 
and 
the 
fumishing 
and  equipment 
of 
the 
completed infrastructure, 
in 
close 
coordination 
with 
FONCODES. 
The 
preventive 
maintenance 
program 
for 
all 
infrastructure considered 
during 
Phase 
I 
will 
be 
implemented 
directly 
by 
the 
schools 
through 
the 
local Parenneacher 
Associations 
with 
funds 
provided 
by 
MED 
at 
an 
expected 
annual 
rate 
of 
US$lOO/classroom. 
Transfers 
would 
be 
carried 
out through 
the 
primary-school 
networks 
by 
MED. 
These 
funds 
would 
be 
considered 
as 
national 
counterpart 
funds 
of 
the 
Project. The 
OJ” 
will 
review 
the 
existing 
maintenance manuals 
and 
re-edit 
them 
to 
distribute 
to 
all 
Project 
schools 
and 
would 
also 
coordinate 
annual 
training 
seminars 
for 
school 
and 
community participating 
agents. 
Financing. 
This 
sub-component 
would 
finance: 
(a) 
in 
the 
head 
of 
primary-school 
networks, construction 
of 
116 
Multi 
Service 
Modules 
(MMS) 
which 
include 
a 
basic 
office/service 
module. Also, 
in 
eight 
locations, a new experimental 
studendteacher 
lodge 
would 
be 
included 
and 
carefully 
evaluated; 
(b) 
construction 
of 
some 
800 
classrooms, 
of 
which 
about 
490 
would 
be 
fully 
substituting  dilapidated 
facilities 
and 
some 
310 
would 
be new 
classrooms 
(78 
for 
preschool education and 232 
for 
secondary 
distance 
education); 
(c) 
construction 
of 
about 
960  complementary 
facilities 
following 
approved 
prototype 
designs, 
of 
which 
up 
to 
130 
would 
substitute 
dilapidated 
kitchen facilities 
and 
some 
720 
missing 
or 
inappropriate 
sanitary 
facilities 
(mainly  latrines),  and 
110 
would 
be 
new 
teacher 
housing 
modules 
in 
those 
very disperse schools 
where 
no 
supply 
from 
neighboring 
communities 
can 
be 
found; 
(d) 
rehabilitation 
of 
up 
to 
1,100 
classrooms, 
of 
which 
some 
350 
require major 
repairs 
and 
minor 
repairs 
for 
about  750, 
as 
well 
as 
major 
repairs 
for 
some 
520 kitchens 
facilities; 
and 
(e) 
new 
fumishing 
for 
all 
classrooms 
and 
furniture 
and 
equipment 
of 
the other service 
and 
administrative 
facilities 
included 
in 
the 
Project. 
Project Component 
3 
- 
US$20.08 
million 
Reform 
of 
Teacher 
Policy 
and 
Education Management 
(21.3 
percent 
of 
total project 
cost) 
Objective. 
A 
key 
objective 
of 
this 
component 
is 
to 
support 
the 
new 
Government’s 
efforts 
to 
promote 
management-related 
initiatives 
by 
addressing 
politically 
sensitive 
issues 
in 
areas 
that 
have been 
among 
the 
most 
important 
constraints 
to 
educational 
progress 
in 
Peru. 
Although 
the 
reforms 
of 
teacher 
policy 
and 
education 
management 
will 
be 
national 
in 
scope, 
they  have considerable 
implications 
for  rural 
schools, 
which 
have 
suffered 
the 
most 
from 
teacher 
low 
quality,  and 
motivation 
linked 
to 
inadequate 
standards 
and incentives, 
and 
a centralized 
system 
of 
education 
management 
that 
has 
failed to 
monitor 
and 
support 
rural 
schools. 
To 
meet 
these 
issues, 
this 
component 
has 
six 
inter-related 
sub-components: 
(a) 
teacher 
policy 
reform; 
(b) 
reform 
of 
education 
management; 
(c) 
financial 
support 
for 
school 
development; 
(d) 
national 
assessment 
system; (e) 
policy 
research; 
and 
(f) 
Project 
management. 
3.1 
Teacher 
Policy 
Reform 
(US$l.60 
million) 
Objective. 
The 
purpose 
of 
this 
sub-component 
is 
to 
support 
MED 
efforts 
to 
boost teaching 
quality 
by 
developing and 
implementing 
a 
standard-based teacher  career 
and development 
reform 
relying 
on 
a 
professional performance evaluation 
mechanism, 
a 
certification 
system, 
and 
a 
set 
of 
instruments 
for 
remuneration 
based 
on 
recognition. 
The 
diagnosis 
of 
the sector 
shows 
a 
lack 
of 
clarity 
as 
to 
what 
students are 
expected 
to 
learn, 
as 
well 
as 
to 
the 
instructional 
practices 
most 
likely to 
work 
in 
the 
highly 
differentiated 
cultural 
and 
socioeconomic 
contexts 
of 
Peru. 
This, 
combined 
with 
fragmented 
and 
unskilled 
management 
controls, 
and scarce 
or 
inappropriate incentives, explains 
the persistence 
of 
low 
education 
quality 
and 
the 
difficulty 
of 
breaking 
- 
52 
- 
Page  59
the 
vicious cycle. 
Clarifying 
the 
expectations 
would provide 
the 
system 
with 
a 
sense 
of 
direction, 
and 
aligning 
all 
the 
elements 
of 
the 
teacher 
training 
strategy 
onto 
agreed-upon 
standards 
would 
promote 
internal 
coherence between 
policy 
statements 
and 
classroom 
practices. 
Implementation 
arrangements. 
The Project 
would 
include: 
(a) 
the 
design 
and 
initial 
implementation 
of 
the 
teacher  career and 
development 
system, 
including: 
(i) 
a 
detailed structure 
of 
the 
teaching 
career 
ladder, 
its 
performance 
and 
experience 
levels 
and 
corresponding 
promotion 
criteria; 
(ii) 
a systematic 
teaching performance evaluation covering 
the 
multidimensional intra- 
and 
extra-classroom roles 
played 
by 
teachers 
in 
their  daily 
educational activities; 
(iii) 
a teacher’s 
initial 
certification 
of 
professional 
quality, 
and 
periodic re-certification 
system. 
The 
re-certification 
process 
is 
expected 
to 
be, 
initially, 
on 
a 
voluntary 
basis and 
later shifted 
to 
compulsory 
status; 
(iv) 
the established 
scenarios 
for 
the 
remuneration 
package and  other 
forms 
of 
incentives 
and 
recognition; 
(b) 
the 
development and 
dissemination 
of 
guidelines, operating 
manuals, 
software 
and 
other instruments 
to 
share 
with 
all 
teachers 
and 
managers 
information 
on 
the 
benefits 
legally 
guaranteed 
and 
conditions 
set 
by 
the 
teacher 
development 
system: (c) 
the 
upgrading 
of 
the 
teacher 
MIS 
(Management 
Information 
System) 
to 
support 
information-based 
teacher management 
and 
deployment. 
The 
h4IS 
will 
maintain 
an 
updated 
data 
bank 
of 
the professional 
development 
status 
of 
every 
single 
teacher, 
starting 
with 
those 
involved 
with 
the 
290 proposed school 
networks. 
This 
information 
system 
will 
become a sine 
qua 
non 
condition 
for 
the 
adequate 
operation 
of 
the 
Continuous 
Teacher 
Development 
System: 
and 
(d) 
the implementation 
of 
several 
national 
and 
local 
workshops 
to 
inform 
teachers  and 
other 
members 
of 
the  education community 
of 
the 
forthcoming 
changes. 
A 
legal 
framework 
for 
the proposed 
teacher 
development 
reform 
hinges 
on the 
existing legislation, 
particularly 
the 
Teachers’ 
Law 
(Ley 
del 
Profesorado) 
and the 
forthcoming 
General 
Education 
Law 
(Ley 
de 
la 
Educacidn 
National) 
and 
the 
Higher 
Education 
Law 
(Ley 
de 
Educacio’n 
Superior), 
which 
will 
rule 
all 
new 
teachers, 
whereas 
the 
current 
ones 
will 
be covered on 
a 
voluntary 
basis. 
By 
2006, 
at 
least 
30 
percent 
of 
all 
teachers 
in 
the 
290 
networks 
are 
expected 
to 
be under 
the new 
legislation. 
By 
the 
end 
of 
Phase 
I, 
the new 
teacher 
professional development structure 
including 
teacher 
performance evaluation 
and salary schedule 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
fully 
in 
place 
in 
the Project 
target 
areas. 
Financing. 
Project 
investments 
would 
include: 
(a) 
consultancies 
with 
a 
variety 
of 
seasoned 
institutional 
experts: 
(b) 
meetings 
to 
discuss 
topics, 
share 
orientation 
and  disseminate 
results 
with 
interested 
stakeholders: 
(c) 
software  acquisition: 
and 
(d) 
pay 
for 
printing 
of 
materials  and  cover 
overall 
sub-component 
implementation. 
3.2 
Reform 
of 
education management 
(US$6.94 
million) 
Objective. 
This 
sub-component 
will 
support 
the  Government’s 
efforts 
to 
“invert 
the 
pyramid” 
of 
education administration 
in 
Peru, 
by 
emphasizing 
the 
focus 
on 
school 
initiatives 
and 
results. 
The 
reform 
will: 
(a) 
increase autonomy 
and 
community voice 
in 
decision-making 
at 
the 
school 
level; 
(b) 
establish 
networks 
in 
rural 
areas 
to 
provide 
support 
for 
isolated 
rural 
schools; 
(c) 
transform the 
existing 
sub-central 
offices 
into 
a 
new 
structure 
for 
local 
supervision 
and 
support 
to 
schools 
at 
a 
provincial 
and 
regional level; 
and 
(d) 
increase 
the accountability 
of 
regional offices 
for 
the performance 
of 
schools 
and other education 
institutions 
under 
their 
jurisdiction. 
Implementation 
arrangements. 
This 
sub-component 
will 
focus 
on: 
(a) 
increasing school autonomy 
by 
(i) 
implanting, 
training 
and 
monitoring 
the 
School 
Council 
in 
3000 
rural 
schools 
as 
a 
mechanism 
for 
community 
expression 
of 
participation 
and 
ownership: 
and 
(ii) 
designing, 
implementing 
and 
disseminating 
the 
Proyectos Educativos Znstitucionales 
- 
PEZ 
in 
at 
least 
200 
rural 
school 
networks 
as 
a 
- 
53 
- 
Page  60
participatory 
planning, implementation, 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
mechanism; 
(b) 
evaluating 
the 
14 
existing 
and 
UDECE-sponsored 
rural 
school 
networks 
so 
that  the experience may be 
improved 
and 
expanded 
into 
the 
290 
networks. 
Lessons 
learned 
would 
be 
incorporated and 
discussed 
within 
a 
planning 
system 
framework 
so 
that 
the 
Project 
would 
be ready 
to 
implement 
future 
rural 
school 
networks, 
train 
their participants 
and 
evaluate 
their activities; 
(c) 
redefining 
and 
assisting 
11 
Regional Offices 
and 
30 
Education 
Management 
Units 
(UGEs) 
and 
their 
respective steering committees 
in 
order 
to 
prepare 
them 
for 
the 
newly 
assigned 
role 
of 
technical  mediators 
between 
schools, 
networks,  “Amauta”  Regional 
Centers 
and 
the 
overall 
system; 
and 
(d) 
fostering  community 
participation 
by: 
(i) 
developing 
and 
disseminating 
the 
concept 
of 
“education 
community” 
involving 
a 
variety 
of 
stakeholders 
(parents, 
teachers, 
NGOs, 
ethnic organizations 
etc.) 
interested 
in 
school mission, role, 
processes 
and 
results; 
(ii) 
challenging 
the 
varied 
support 
deriving 
from 
community-at-large 
into 
School Councils, 
PEIs 
and 
other 
school 
expressions 
and 
projects. 
This 
sub-component 
would 
be 
supported, 
in 
part, 
by 
DFID 
through 
its 
Project 
on 
Rural 
Education. 
This 
Project 
has 
targeted 
its 
activities 
in 
3 
departments 
of 
Peru 
which 
are 
within 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
Project: 
Piura, 
Cusco  and 
San 
Martin. 
The 
Project 
aims 
to 
strengthen 
school  autonomy  through 
the 
implementation 
of 
School 
Councils 
and 
Networks, 
with 
community 
participation. 
The 
instruments 
and 
lessons 
learnt 
from 
these 
interventions 
will 
be 
used 
in 
the strengthening 
of 
school 
autonomy 
in 
the 
remaining Project 
areas. 
Financing. 
Investments 
will 
be 
made 
in: 
(a) 
consulting 
services, 
(b) 
professional and 
parent 
training 
on 
PEI 
design 
and  implementation, 
(c) 
data 
and 
lessons 
dissemination, 
(d) 
stakeholder 
meetings, 
(e) 
equipment 
for 
sub-central 
offices, 
(f) 
process 
in 
outcome 
evaluation,  and 
(g) 
handbooks and 
PEI 
development and 
printing. 
3.3. 
School 
Development 
Fund 
(US$1.76 
million) 
Objective. 
The 
key 
objective 
of 
this 
sub-component 
is 
to 
improve 
local 
school ownership 
and 
governance 
through  the 
support 
of 
School 
and 
Network 
Councils,  design 
and 
implementation 
of 
Institutional 
Educational 
Plans 
(PEIs) 
and 
development 
of 
schools 
networks. PEIs 
are 
expected 
to 
become a 
crucial 
instrument 
for 
the 
development 
of 
local 
participation 
and 
ownership, 
in 
the 
increase 
of 
a 
bottom 
up 
commitment 
process. 
Implementation 
arrangements. 
Since 
the 
ultimate 
objective 
of 
the  education 
system 
is 
to 
support 
students’ 
learning 
in 
development 
improvements 
at 
the school level, 
each 
School 
Council 
will 
develop 
a 
PEI. 
Individual 
schools 
will 
work 
through 
their 
networks 
to 
support 
each 
other 
in 
diagnosing 
problems, 
setting 
priorities, 
and 
developing credible, time-bound action 
plans 
for 
achieving their 
individual 
school 
goals. 
As 
a 
network, 
the  schools 
will 
ensure 
that 
these 
institutional 
plans 
aggregate 
into 
a 
network 
development 
plan 
that 
represents 
a coherent strategy 
for 
the 
micro-region. 
The new 
UGEs 
will 
review 
and 
approve 
network 
development 
plans. 
As 
a 
planning, implementation 
and 
evaluation 
instrument, 
the 
PEI 
will 
become 
part 
of 
the 
routine 
school 
management 
process. 
To 
assist 
schools 
in 
implementing their 
PEIs, 
the School Development 
Fund 
will 
be 
established, 
which 
will 
channel 
resources 
to 
individual 
schools 
through their 
networks. 
Because 
of 
the 
newness 
of 
this 
process, 
implementation 
will 
be gradual 
and 
it 
is 
expected that plans 
will 
be 
ready 
only 
during 
the 
second 
year 
of 
implementation. 
Thus, 
a 
total 
of 
150 
PEIs 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
financed: 
fifty 
in 
the 
second 
year, 
and 
one 
hundred 
in 
the 
third 
year. 
The 
amount 
available 
for 
each 
project 
will 
be 
defined 
based 
on 
the 
size 
and 
characteristics 
of 
four 
types 
of 
school networks. 
The 
MED 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
monitoring 
and 
evaluating the 
process, 
the 
use 
of 
resources, 
and results.

3.4 
National 
Assessment 
System 
(US$4.61 
million) 
Objective. 
This 
sub-component 
will 
help 
the 
Quality 
Assessment 
Unit 
(Unidad 
de 
Medicibn 
de 
la 
Calidud Educativa 
- 
UMC) to 
carry 
out 
activities 
to 
continue strengthening 
its 
technical capacity 
and 
promoting 
the 
enhancement 
of 
an 
"assessment 
culture" throughout the 
entire 
education 
system 
and 
the 
strengthening 
of 
the 
Education Statistics 
Unit 
(Unidad 
de 
Estadistica Educativa 
- 
UEE). 
Zmplementution 
arrangements. 
MED 
has 
two 
key 
units 
responsible 
for following 
up 
progress 
in 
the 
sector's 
performance: 
(a) 
The 
first 
one, 
the 
UMC, 
has 
significantly 
increased 
its 
technical capacity over 
the 
last eight 
years 
and 
has 
conducted three 
sample-based 
national 
assessments 
in 
1996, 1998 and 2001. 
The 
first 
two 
assessments 
were norm-based 
and 
were 
not 
calibrated 
so 
as 
to 
allow 
the 
monitoring 
of 
results 
over 
time. 
The 
results 
from 
these 
assessments 
were 
published 
only 
recently, 
due 
to 
the 
previous 
government's concerns about 
making 
them public. The 2001 
assessment was 
criterion-referenced 
and, 
for 
the 
first 
time, sampled schools 
in 
rural 
areas, 
including 
Quechua 
and 
Aymara 
speakers. 
This 
assessment 
will 
provide 
the 
baseline 
measures 
of 
student 
performance 
for 
the project/program; 
and 
(b) 
The 
second 
area, 
the 
UEE, 
is 
responsible 
for 
the  development  and 
follow-up 
of 
information 
and 
has 
evolved 
significantly 
in 
tracking 
enrollment 
and 
internal  efficiency 
indicators.  However, 
it 
is 
seriously 
constrained 
by 
low 
capacity 
at 
the 
local 
levels 
for 
collecting 
and  processing 
information. 
Data 
dissemination 
is 
mainly 
limited 
to 
the 
availability 
of 
large 
databases 
in 
MED's 
website 
which 
are 
difficult 
to 
manage. 
UEE 
will 
provide 
the 
Project 
with 
the 
necessary 
information 
to 
build 
indicators. 
It 
will 
also 
assist 
in 
the 
final 
identification 
of 
the 
geographical 
limits 
to 
the networks 
through 
the 
GIS 
system. 
The 
sub-component 
will 
help 
UMC 
to: 
(a) 
develop 
and 
administer 
the 
2004 
national 
assessment 
in 
language, 
mathematics and 
social 
skills 
for 
2nd. 
and 6th. 
primary 
education 
grades, 
and 3rd. and 
5th. 
secondary 
education 
grades 
(including 
tests 
in 
four 
native 
languages, 
namely 
Aymara, 
Aguaruna 
and 
two 
versions 
of 
Quechua); 
(b) 
develop 
and 
administer 
the 2004 
national 
assessment 
system 
on 
mathematics 
and 
communication 
for 
2nd 
and 
6th 
grade students 
of 
primary 
as 
well 
as 
3rd 
and 
5th 
grade students 
of 
secondary schools. 
Similarly, 
in 
2004 the 
system 
will 
assess 
citizenship 
education

for 
students 
enrolled 
in 
6th 
grade 
of 
primary 
and 
5th 
grade 
of 
secondary education; 
(c) 
develop and 
administer 
in 
2004 
a 
census-based 
assessment 
on 
mathematics 
and communication 
skills 
(2nd and 
6th 
grades 
of 
primary 
education) and 
citizenship education 
(6th 
grade 
of 
primary 
education) 
in 
areas 
to 
be 
determined 
by 
the 
UMC; 
(d) 
develop 
and 
administer 
in 
collaboration 
with 
the  school  networks 
a 
self-administered 
census-based 
application 
to 
assess 
mathematics 
and 
communication 
skills 
of 
students 
enrolled 
in 
6th 
grade 
of 
primary 
schools 
using 
the 
item 
bank 
developed 
by 
the 
UMC. 
These 
tests 
will 
be 
administered 
in 
schools 
of 
the 
project 
area 
in 
2006 
after 
a 
pilot 
is 
conducted 
in 
2005. 
In 
addition 
to 
these 
tests 
each 
school 
will 
receive 
a 
set 
of 
materials 
containing 
information 
regarding 
the 
tests, 
how 
to 
administer 
them, 
evaluate 
them 
and 
interpret 
their 
results; 
(e) 
carry out 
a 
longitudinal 
study 
aimed 
at 
assessing 
trends 
in 
basic 
education 
in 
areas 
to 
be 
defined 
by 
the 
UMC; 
(f) 
carry 
out 
studies 
to 
assess 
communication 
skills 
in 
a 
sample 
of 
students whose 
native 
language 
is 
Aymara, 
Aguaruna 
and 
two 
variants 
of 
Quechua; 
(g) 
implement 
a study on 
school effectiveness 
in 
a 
small number 
of 
schools 
aimed 
at 
complementing 
national 
assessment 
results 
and 
gathering 
knowledge 
on educational 
processes; 
and 
(h) 
finance 
institutions or 
consultants 
to 
carry out 
research 
using 
the 
data 
available. 
Financing. 
Assistance

Annex 
4: 
Cost 
Benefit Analysis Summary 
PERU: 
Rural Education 
Project 
Introduction 
A 
cost 
benefit 
analysis 
was 
carried out 
in 
two 
parts: 
initial 
education 
intervention 
(Component 
1) 
and 
the 
primary education 
intervention 
(Components 
2 
and 
3). 
The 
secondary distance 
education 
sub-component 
was 
not 
subject 
to 
this 
analysis 
because 
it 
is 
designed 
as 
a 
pilot 
specifically 
to 
gather 
information 
for 
future economic 
analysis and 
final 
component 
design. 
The 
cost 
benefit 
analysis 
is 
based 
on 
economic 
rates 
of 
return 
calculated 
under 
alternative 
scenarios 
of 
changes 
in 
efficiency 
rates. 
Different 
combinations 
of 
paths 
in 
the 
reduction 
of 
dropout 
and 
repetition 
rates are consistent 
with 
different 
values 
of 
completion 
rates 
in 
2013. 
This 
Annex 
summarizes 
the 
cost 
benefit 
analysis. 
The main 
document 
is 
included 
in 
the 
Project 
files. 
Overall 
Results 
The results 
of 
the 
cost 
benefit 
analysis 
are 
based 
on 
relatively 
conservative 
and 
alternative 
scenarios 
that 
were 
constructed 
using 
various 
assumptions 
of 
improvements 
in 
efficiency 
rates, 
including 
productivity, 
repetition 
and 
dropout 
rates 
resulting 
from 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Project. 
To 
find 
the 
economic 
return 
of 
the Project, 
each 
scenario 
is 
compared 
to 
a baseline 
(without 
project) that 
assumes 
a 
10 
percent 
reduction 
of 
repetition 
and dropout 
rates 
for 
primary 
and 
secondary 
levels. 
The 
analysis 
shows 
that 
the 
project 
is 
reasonably 
viable 
from 
an 
economic 
point 
of 
view. Despite 
being 
conservative 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
expected 
improvement 
in 
external 
efficiency 
rates 
and 
with 
conservative 
assumptions 
of 
GDP 
growth, 
ERR 
(Economic 
Rate 
of 
Return) 
estimates 
fall 
in 
the 
range 
of 
8 
percent 
to 
16 percent 
for 
the 
initial 
education intervention. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
primary 
education 
(Component 
2 
and 
3-, 
the estimated 
ERR 
fall 
in 
the 
range 
of 
8 
percent 
to 
23 
percent. 
In 
a 
reasonable 
scenario, 
in 
which primary 
completion 
rates reach 
90 
percent 
in 
10 
years, 
the 
ERR 
ranges 
between 
11.4 
percent 
and 
17.7 
percent, 
depending 
on 
assumptions 
regarding 
once 
and 
for 
all 
small 
increases 
in 
productivity 
as 
a 
consequence 
of 
improvement 
in 
the 
quality 
of 
education. 
The results 
of 
the 
analysis 
should be 
considered 
as 
a 
lower 
bound, 
given 
that the economic 
indicators 
used 
were 
quite 
conservative 
and 
the 
estimates 
of 
the 
ERR 
do 
not 
take 
into 
account 
all 
externalities 
resulting 
from 
the 
Project. 
In 
addition, 
several 
components 
of 
the project, 
such 
as 
the 
teacher 
training 
institutions 
accreditation 
system, 
the 
institutional 
strengthening and the 
reform 
of 
the 
teachers' career 
are 
elements 
that 
will 
benefit 
all 
Peruvian 
students. 
Thus, 
the analysis leads 
to 
the 
conclusion that  there 
is 
reasonable 
certainty that a 
comprehensive 
intervention 
in 
rural 
education, 
such 
as 
this 
Project, should 
effect 
changes 
in 
key education indicators, 
as 
long 
as 
it 
is 
implemented appropriately 
and 
as 
planned. 
Gains 
from 
the 
project 
are 
observed 
much later 
in 
time, 
but 
are 
crucial 
in 
terms 
of 
improvements on the 
economic 
and social 
well-being 
of 
beneficiaries. 
Summary 
of 
Benefits 
and 
Costs: 
costs 
The 
costs 
were 
calculated 
for 
the 
initial 
education 
intervention 
(Component 
1) 
and 
the 
primary 
education 
intervention 
(Components 
2 
and 
3) 
including 
direct 
and 
recurrent 
costs 
of 
the 
project, 
and the 
opportunity 
cost 
of 
going 
to 
school, 
as 
children 
join 
later 
the 
labor 
market 
as 
a 
consequence 
of 
lower 
dropout 
rates. 
-

Page  65
The 
opportunity 
cost 
was 
considered 
as 
a 
key component 
of 
the 
cost analysis. 
More 
time 
spent 
in 
school 
implies 
working 
less, 
which 
is 
particularly important 
in 
Peruvian 
rural 
areas. 
However, the market value 
of 
that 
time 
is 
low, 
as 
most 
children 
will 
work 
at 
home 
as 
unpaid 
family 
workers. 
In 
spite 
of 
this, 
in 
terms 
of 
value, 
the 
opportunity 
cost 
is 
one 
of 
the 
largest cost 
components. 
Some 
important 
issues 
should 
be 
taken 
into 
account: 
(i) 
only 
additional 
current 
costs 
due 
to 
the 
increase 
in 
the 
enrollment 
in 
primary 
and secondary 
education 
are 
considered 
in 
the 
evaluation; 
(ii) 
infrastructure 
investments 
that 
might 
be 
required 
due 
to 
an 
increase 
in 
enrollment 
were 
not 
considered; 
(iii) 
the 
model 
assumes 
that 
students 
who dropout 
from 
the 
school 
system 
start 
working 
the 
following 
year, 
except 
for 
children 
under 
10 
who do 
not 
work, 
because 
the 
labor 
market 
is 
too small 
and, 
therefore the 
opportunity 
cost 
for 
these 
children 
is 
negligible; 
and 
(iv) 
there 
are 
additional 
costs, 
for 
example, 
the 
additional 
cost 
incurred 
by 
MOE 
and 
parents 
as 
children 
stay 
longer 
in 
school. 
The 
following 
costs 
were 
used 
in 
determining the 
additional 
costs 
to 
the 
GOP:

and 
“animadoras” 
amount 
to 
approximately 
US$4.3 
million 
in 
the 
first

the project. 
Additional 
recurrent 
costs 
in 
respect 
to 
salaries, 
training 
and 
maintenance 
starting 
in 
2007 
are 
calculated 
to 
be 
US$

although 
they 
fall 
slightly 
afterwards. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
the interventions

GOP 
is 
expected 
to 
continue 
paying 
a

to 
animadoras 
of 
US$43 
per month, 
and 
also 
salaries 
of 
US$ 
171 
to

per 
each 
10 
animadoras. 
In 
the

children 
3

5 
years

the 
same 
salaries 
for 
animadoras

Component 
3: 
Reform 
of

and 
Education 
Management 
In 
this 
case, 
recurrent 
costs are based 
on 
the 
cost 
of 
implementing 
standardized 
tests 
periodically 
and 
computer replacement every 
four 
years. 
This 
amount 
is 
approximately 
US$0.4 
million. 
The 
cost 
analysis 
assumes 
that 
household 
expenditures 
per 
pupil 
will 
remain 
constant over 
time 
at 
US$22, US$27, US$90, 
for initial, 
primary 
and 
secondary 
students 
respectively. 
Public 
expenditures 
are 
also considered 
and 
are assumed 
to 
remain 
constant 
per 
pupil 
at 
the 
2002 
levels, 
i.e. 
US$164 
and 
US$235 
for 
primary 
and 
secondary 
education  respectively. 
Cost 
per 
pupil, 
however, 
may 
increase 
as 
a 
consequence 
of 
the 
teachers' career 
reform. 
Only 
current 
additional 
costs due 
to 
increase 
in 
enrollment 
in 
primary 
and secondary are 
considered 
in 
the evaluation. 
Costs 
exclude 
taxes. 
Benefits 
The 
measurable 
benefits 
of 
the 
whole project 
stem 
from 
the 
reduction 
in 
repetition 
rates, 
which 
lead 
to 
savings 
in 
terms 
of 
overall 
expenditures per 
pupil. 
As 
quality 
is 
improved, 
productivity 
associated 
to 
education 
rises 
and students 
stay 
longer 
in 
school. 
As 
average years 
of 
schooling 
increase, 
so 
do future 
earnings 
to 
beneficiaries. 
The 
children 
of 
the 
290 
school networks 
in 
11 
departments 
are 
direct 
beneficiaries 
of 
the 
project, 
and 
they 
are 
considered 
as 
unique beneficiaries 
in 
the 
economic 
assessment. 
However, 
several 
interventions 
generate 
new policies, knowledge and educational technologies that 
will 
benefit 
all 
children 
in 
rural 
areas, 
and 
in 
some 
cases, 
the 
whole educational 
system. 
This 
also leads 
to 
an 
underestimation 
of 
the 
benefits. 
The 
methodology 
for 
the 
calculation 
of 
the 
benefits 
of 
the 
project 
includes: 
a) 
calculation 
of 
the 
flow 
of 
students 
from 
grade 
to 
grade 
in 
order 
to 
determine: 
(i) 
the 
expected 
number 
of 
students 
who complete 
primary 
level 
at 
any 
age; 
and, 
(ii) 
the number 
of 
students 
who 
enter 
the 
labor 
market 
having 
acquired 
a 
specific schooling level; 
b) 
various 
assumptions 
are 
made 
for 
the 
reduction 
of 
repetition 
and 
dropout 
rates, 
which 
lead 
to 
different 
enrollment  rate 
scenarios. 
Based 
on 
these 
assumptions,  changes 
in 
completion 
rates 
and 
schooling attainment 
due 
to 
increases 
in 
efficiency 
of 
the 
system 
are 
calculated; 
and, 
c) 
increases 
in 
schooling attainment 
were 
converted 
to 
monetary 
values 
using 
earnings 
predictions 
based 
upon coefficients  estimated 
from 
an 
earnings 
function 
which 
contains 
yearly 
labor 
income, 
as 
depended 
variable, 
and 
as 
independent 
variables: 
sex, 
potential 
experience, 
hours  worked per 
year, 
dummy 
variables 
for 
educational levels (complete 
secondary 
and 
incomplete 
and 
complete), 
years 
in 
primary 
and 
secondary. 
The 
benefit Project analysis 
of 
the 
took 
into 
account 
the 
following: 
Component 
I: 
Expanding Education 
Access 
for 
Rural 
Children. 
The 
beneficiaries 
of 
this 
component 
will 
be: 
(i) 
30,000 
children 
0-2 
years 
old with 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
non-formal 
approach 
in 
which 
children 
will 
be 
educated 
along 
with 
their 
parents and siblings 
within 
a 
family 
community 
framework, 
and 
(ii) 
a 
total 
of 
38,000 
children 
3-5 
year 
old 
are 
expected 
to 
benefit 
through 
an 
intervention 
combining 
of 
formal 
and 
non-formal 
approaches. 
For 
the 
calculation 
of 
the 
benefits, 
it 
was  assumed 
that 
the 
number 
of 
-60- 
Page  67
entrants 
to primary 
school 
each year 
is 
the 
same 
as 
the 
number 
of 
5 
year 
old 
students 
enrolled 
the 
year 
before on 
a 
CEI 
or 
PRONEI. 
Component 
2 
and 
3:lmproving 
Quality 
in  Rural 
Primary 
Schools, 
Reform 
of 
Teacher 
Policy 
and 
Education 
Management. 
This 
component 
will 
benefit 
215,000 
rural 
primary 
education 
students 
in 
290 
networks 
in 
11 
departments. 
The 
first 
step 
in 
the 
calculation 
of 
benefits 
is 
the 
analysis 
of 
the 
flow 
of 
students 
from 
grade 
to 
grade, 
through 
the 
estimation 
of 
a 
set 
of 
repetition, 
promotion 
and 
dropout 
rates 
for 
each grade. 
The 
number 
of 
new entrants remains constant 
after 
2005, 
when 
all 
the schools 
from 
the 
290 
networks have 
been 
intervened 
by 
the 
project. 
It 
is 
assumed 
that,  even 
if 
there 
is 
an 
expected 
demographic 
reduction 
in 
the 
size 
of 
the 
new cohorts 
in 
rural 
areas, 
this 
does 
not 
affect enrollments, 
since 
better school 
quality 
will 
tend 
to 
attract new 
students. 
Main 
Assumptions: 
General 
Issues 
As 
a 
consequence 
of 
a 
higher 
quality 
initial 
education, 
primary 
repetition 
and dropout 
rates 
are 
reduced. 
Estimations 
of 
economic 
rates 
of 
return 
are 
based 
on 
constant returns 
of 
education 
for 
each 
individual 
during 
the 
life 
cycle. 
However, 
the  analysis 
assumes  scenarios 
of 
increased 
productivity. 
Private 
net 
benefits 
are 
negative 
during 
the 
first 
years 
due 
to 
opportunity 
costs. 
It 
is 
important 
to 
note that reductions 
in 
dropout 
rates 
reduce 
returns 
due 
to 
the 
weight 
of 
opportunity 
costs, 
as 
a 
result, 
future 
returns 
due 
to 
more 
years 
of 
schooling 
are 
highly 
discounted. 
Regarding 
direct 
costs, 
the 
first 
three 
years are 
pre-tax investments and recurrent 
costs. 
Additional 
household 
expenditures 
remain 
constant since 
2015. 
It 
may 
be 
argued that 
given that 
the 
public 
sector 
will 
provide 
rural 
students 
with 
more learning 
materials, 
household 
will 
not 
need 
to 
devote 
resources 
to 
education 
as 
they 
currently 
do. 
However, 
it 
could 
be 
possible that 
a 
higher 
quality 
education 
is 
perceived 
as 
a 
more 
profitable 
investment, 
so 
families 
are 
willing 
to 
devote 
more 
resources. 
In 
this 
case, 
it 
was 
considered that 
family 
expenditure 
per student 
remain 
at 
their 
2000 
level. 
Additional public 
costs 
due 
to 
enrollments 
depend 
on 
per 
student 
public 
expenditures. 
These 
expenditures 
are 
assumed 
to 
stay 
constant 
at 
their 
2002 
level. 
It 
is 
known 
that, 
if 
educational 
expenditures 
increase 
as 
a 
consequence 
of 
a 
larger educational 
effort 
at 
the macro level, 
or 
as 
a 
consequence 
of 
growth,  expenditures 
will 
be 
greater. 
However, 
assuming any increase 
in 
the 
educational 
system, 
expenditures 
per 
student 
should 
imply 
a 
change 
in 
the 
quality 
of 
the service, 
which 
should have 
an 
impact over 
benefits. 
Therefore, 
in 
order 
to 
isolate 
these 
effects 
of 
the 
project, 
it 
is 
reasonable 
to 
assume 
that 
there 
are 
no 
additional 
changes 
in 
the 
educational 
system.

A 
25 
percent 
reduction 
in 
both 
repetition 
and 
dropout 
rates 
was asssumed 
in 
order 
to 
calculate 
the 
economic rate 
of 
return 
of 
this 
component. 
The 
analysis 
assumes 
two 
scenarios 
of 
productivity: 
the 
first 
one 
implies 
that 
there 
is 
no 
increase 
in 
labor 
productivity 
due 
to 
the 
Project, 
while 
the 
second 
assumes 
that there 
is 
an 
increase 
of 
5 
percent 
for 
those 
who 
only 
finish 
any grade 
from 
primary 
and 
2.5 
percent 
for 
those 
who 
reach 
secondary. 
No 
immediate 
gains were accounted 
for 
better 
nutrition, 
better

environment

that

the 
alternative figures 
are

Migration

increases 
sharply 
as 
a 
consequence 
both 
of

and 
of

the

of 
rural

tend

be 
similar 
to

Various

developed 
using 
different 
efficiency 
rates 
resulting 
from 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Project. 
In 
all 
cases, 
the 
baseline

rates 
in 
2003 
are 
the

as 
those

fall

Several economic 
rates 
of 
return 
under 
alternative 
scenarios 
of 
changes 
in 
efficiency 
and 
productivity 
rates 
are 
analyzed 
above. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
a 
reduction 
of 
50 
percent 
in 
repetition 
rates and 
75 
percent 
in 
dropout 
rates 
will 
move 
the 
system 
towards 
a 
completion rate 
of 
89 
percent 
in 
2013, 
the 
ERR 
ranges 
between 
11.4 
and 
17.7 
percent. 
It 
should 
be 
noted that 
ERR 
are 
very 
sensitive 
to 
changes 
in 
productivity 
because 
of 
assuming a 
nil 
increase 
in 
productivity, 
the 
resulting 
ERR 
ranges 
between 
8 
and 
15.6 
percent. 
Increases 
in 
productivity 
are 
totally 
justifiable, 
since 
not only 
a 
higher 
quality 
education should 
not only 
generate 
that 
students 
stay 
longer 
in 
school, and consequently 
attain 
more 
years 
of 
education, 
but 
also 
the 
economic return 
in 
terms 
of 
learning 
-which 
will 
later translate 
into 
earnings- 
of 
each 
of 
those years 
is 
larger. 
Moreover, 
the 
reason 
why children 
stay 
longer 
in 
school 
is 
because 
they perceive 
a 
higher 
quality 
in 
each year 
they 
are 
in 
school, 
and 
consequently they 
are 
more 
willing 
to 
invest their 
time 
and 
money.

Financial 
Analysis: 
This 
section 
presents 
recent data 
regarding 
educational expenditures 
in 
Peru, 
several 
alternative 
scenarios 
of 
expenditures 
for 
the 
following 
years, 
and the 
impact 
of 
the 
project 
costs 
over 
total 
expenditures. 
There 
are 
only preliminary 
figures 
for overall 
educational expenditures 
in 
2003. 
As 
shown 
in 
Table 
1, 
between 
2000 and 
2001 
there 
was 
a 
reduction 
in 
educational 
expenditures. 
During 
the 
first 
half 
of 
2001, 
with 
the 
Transition 
Government, there 
was 
a 
contraction 
of 
fiscal 
expenditures. Later, 
in 
the 
second 
half 
of 
the 
year, 
the 
new 
government increased 
expenditures 
slightly, 
including 
a 
9 
percent raise 
in 
teachers 
salaries, 
which 
was 
the 
first 
increase 
in 
pensionable 
salaries 
in 
25 
years. 
In 
2002, 
public 
educational 
expenditures were 
US$ 
1.7 
1 
billion, 
representing 
3 
percent 
of 
GDP.

Given 
the 
priorities 
established 
by 
the 
current administration, 
it 
is 
likely 
that 
resources 
devoted 
to 
education 
will 
increase. 
The GOP 
has 
established, 
although 
not 
formally, 
two 
specific 
targets, 
one 
is 
the 
increase 
of 
the 
share 
of 
education 
in 
the 
public 
budget 
from 
the 
current 19 percent 
to 
30 
percent 
in 
2006. 
The 
second one 
is 
doubling 
teachers’  salaries 
by 
that 
year. 
It 
will 
probably 
be 
difficult 
to 
meet 
any 
of 
these 
targets. 
In 
what 
follows, 
scenarios 
that contemplate 
the 
implications 
of 
meeting 
these 
targets 
are 
analyzed. 
Table 
3 
shows 
a 
projection 
for 
the 
period 
2004-2009 assuming 
that expenditures 
in 
education reach 
30 
percent 
of 
the 
public 
budget 
in 
2006. 
Given 
the 
paucity 
of 
the 
increase 
in 
fiscal 
revenues 
and 
the 
deficit 
targets 
set 
by 
the 
GOP, 
it 
is 
unlikely 
that 
public 
expenditures 
as 
a percentage 
of 
GDP 
will 
increase. 
In 
that 
case, 
and assuming 
therefore 
that 
non 
financial 
public 
expenditures 
stays 
at 
15.5 
percent, 
reaching 
this 
target 
is 
consistent 
with 
public 
educational expenditures reaching 
4.65 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2006. 
Attaining 
this 
target 
would 
imply 
increasing educational expenditures 
by 
75 
percent. 
Per 
capita 
public 
expenditures 
as 
a 
percentage 
of 
per capita 
GDP, 
a 
measure 
of 
the “educational 
effort“ 
of 
the 
country 
would 
reach 
14.2 
percent 
in 
primary 
and 
20 
percent 
in 
secondary, 
up 
from 
8.2 
and 
11.6 
percent, 
respectively 
in 
2002. 
Many 
of 
these 
figures, except 
for 
the 
implicit 
expenditures 
per 
student 
are 
near 
or 
above 
international 
standards. 
For 
instance, 
educational 
expenditures 
as 
a percentage 
of 
GDP 
in 
OECD 
countries 
average 
4.8 
percent, 
in 
Chile 
is 
3.2 
percent 
and 
in 
Argentina 
3.7 
percent. 
Still, 
reaching 
4.7 
percent may 
be 
a 
reasonable 
objective 
for 
a 
country 
like 
Peru, 
although 
it 
is 
too 
optimistic 
that 
it 
can 
be 
reached 
in 
about 4 
years. 
What 
makes 
this 
objective apparently 
unattainable, 
is 
that the target 
itself, 
a 
share 
of 
education 
of 
30 
percent 
of 
the 
public 
budget 
is 
way 
above 
international 
standards. 
In 
OECD 
countries, 
this 
share 
is 
14 
percent, 
in 
Brazil 
is 
17 
percent, 
in 
Chile 
16 percent and 
in 
Argentina 
14 
percent; 
in 
Asian countries 
like 
Malaysia, 
it 
reaches 
14 
percent and 
in 
Thailand 
22 percent. 
The educational 
effort 
measured 
as 
per 
student 
expenditure over per capita 
GDP 
will 
also 
be 
above 
other 
Latin 
American 
countries 
public 
education 
systems, 
like 
Brazil 
and 
Argentina, 
where 
it 
is 
the range 
of 
12-13 
percent (primary)  and 
17 
percent (secondary) 
. 
In 
Asia, 
Mingat 
calculates 
that 
the 
figure 
for 
primary 
reaches 
11 
percent (1990) 
and 
secondary 
15 
percent 
(1990). 
Despite 
high 
growth, 
increases 
during 
the 
nineties 
were 
relatively 
modest.

The 
second scenario, 
consistent 
with 
the other target 
set 
by 
the current 
government 
is 
doubling 
teachers' 
salaries 
by 
2006. 
The 
scenario 
has 
been 
operationalized 
by 
increasing 
in 
20 
percent 
per 
year 
all 
expenditures 
in 
personnel 
in 
the 
educational 
sectors 
since 
2004 
until 
2006. 
It 
is 
assumed 
that 
all 
other 
current expenditures 
increase 
at 
a 
the 
same 
rate 
as 
the product. 
Doubling 
teachers' salaries 
requires 
an 
increase 
in 
current expenditures 
of 
15 
percent 
per 
year 
between 
2004 
and 
2006. 
This 
increase 
implies 
that 
public 
educational 
expenditures 
as 
a 
share 
of 
GDP 
will 
increase 
by 
0.7 
percentage 
point. 
Assuming 
that the 
size 
of 
the 
public 
sector 
stays 
at 
15.5 
percent 
of 
GDP, 
it 
also 
implies 
that the 
share 
of 
education 
in 
the 
public 
budget 
will 
increase 
to 
25 
percent. 
Also 
in 
this 
case, 
the 
increase 
in 
educational expenditures 
will 
require 
a huge 
fiscal 
effort, 
in 
particular 
in 
terms 
of 
state 
restructuring, 
as 
the 
required 
one 
fourth 
of 
the 
budget 
is 
above 
what any 
country's 
public 
sector 
devotes 
to 
education. 
In 
terms 
of 
the 
country's educational 
effort, 
this 
increase 
in 
salaries 
will 
imply 
a 
ratio 
of 
per 
student 
expenditure 
over 
per capita 
GDP 
of 
1 
1.8 
and 
16.6 
percent 
for 
primary 
and 
secondary 
respectively 
(See 
Table 
4).

A 
third 
scenario 
shows 
the 
implications 
of 
an 
optimistic 
but 
attainable 
scenario 
in 
which 
both 
the 
share 
of 
education 
in 
the 
public 
budget 
increases, 
but 
with 
a simultaneous 
small 
increase 
in 
the 
size 
of 
the 
public 
sector 
(Table 
5). 
As 
observed above 
the 
main 
problem 
of 
reaching the 
target 
of 
doubling 
teacher 
salaries 
was 
that 
maintaining 
the 
same 
size 
of 
the 
public 
sector, 
in 
a 
context 
of 
moderate 
growth, 
requires 
a huge 
reduction 
in 
the 
share 
of 
other 
sectors 
in 
order 
to 
give 
space 
to 
education 
expenditures. 
In 
this 
scenario 
the 
size 
of 
the 
non 
financial 
public 
sector 
increases 
from 
15.5 
to 
16.5 
percent, 
which 
requires 
that 
tax reforms 
are 
implemented 
and are 
really 
effective 
in 
increasing 
collection 
such 
us 
to 
finance  permanently higher  current 
expenditures. 
Expenditures 
as 
a percentage 
of 
GDP 
rise 
to 
3.6 
percent, 
all 
of 
which 
is 
consistent 
with 
a 
share 
of 
education 
in 
the 
public 
budget 
of 
22 
percent. 
This 
latter 
figure 
is 
still 
high, 
which 
suggests 
that a 
restructuring 
of 
the 
state 
is 
a 
priority. 
In 
this 
scenario, 
by 
2006, 
total 
expenditure 
in 
education 
increases 
in 
37 percent 
and 
per 
pupil 
expenditure 
reaches 
US$ 
272 
in 
primary 
and 
US$384 
in 
secondary. 
- 
65 
- 
Page  72
Despite 
the 
fact 
that  what 
the 
public 
sector 
expenditure  per 
pupil 
is 
still 
very 
low, 
the 
implicit 
educational 
effort 
is 
relatively 
high: 
the 
ratio 
of 
expenditures per 
student 
in 
primary 
over 
per 
capita 
GDP 
is 
10.97 
percent and 
in 
secondary 
15.46 
percent, 
slightly 
below 
Brazil 
and Argentina, 
and 
much 
lower 
than 
the 
figure 
observed 
in 
OECD 
countries, were 
per 
pupil 
expenditures 
in 
education 
reaches 
18 
percent 
of 
per capita 
GDP 
in 
primary 
and 
29 
percent 
in 
secondary.

efficieccy~catasoftheScholCm”. 
There 
are 
two 
main 
points 
that can be 
derived 
from 
this 
analysis. 
First, 
the current 
size 
of 
the 
public 
sector 
is 
small 
to 
sustain 
an 
important 
increase 
in 
educational 
expenditures. 
A 
reform 
will 
be 
required 
in 
order 
to 
restructure 
the 
public 
sector 
in 
order 
to 
increase the 
share 
of 
educational 
expenditures. 
Second, 
any 
attainable 
change 
in 
the structure 
of 
expenditures 
within 
the 
public 
sector 
will 
fall 
short 
of 
what 
is 
needed 
to 
increase expenditures 
in 
education 
and achieve established 
goals. 
The country 
requires 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
overall 
ratio 
of 
government 
expenditures 
as 
a percentage 
of 
GDP. 
However, 
for 
any 
increase 
in 
this 
line 
to 
be 
effective, 
a 
previous 
reform 
of 
the 
public 
sector 
is 
required.

Fiscal 
Impact: 
The 
fiscal 
impact 
of 
the 
project 
is 
relatively 
small. 
We 
have calculated the 
state 
counterpart, 
the 
implicit 
additional 
fiscal 
costs 
due 
to 
higher  enrollments 
generated 
by 
both 
the 
initial 
education 
and basic 
education interventions, recurrent 
costs and 
debt 
service. 
The 
financial impact 
has 
been 
calculated on the 
basis 
of 
the 
third 
simulation 
of 
overall fiscal 
expenditures 
and 
using 
the 
scenario 
of 
the 
economic 
analysis, 
which 
assumes 
a 
reduction 
in 
repetition 
rates 
of 
50 
percent and dropout 
rates 
of 
75 
percent 
by 
2009. 
Until 
2009, 
all 
implicit, 
recurrent 
and 
direct 
expenditures 
of 
the 
project 
amount 
for 
less 
than 
1 
percent 
of 
the 
overall 
expenditures 
in 
education, 
reaching 
at 
most 
0.78 
percent 
of 
additional 
costs. 
Also, 
they 
represent less 
than 
2 
percent 
of 
current 
expenditures 
in 
initial 
and basic education. 
Recurrent 
costs are 
mainly training 
expenditures 
and 
materials. They 
increase 
sharply 
in 
the 
two 
years 
following 
phase 
one 
due 
to training 
interventions that 
start 
in 
2004 and 2005 
that last 
for 
three 
years. 
Afterwards, 
these 
costs 
fall. 
Table 
6 
Fiscal 
Impact 
of 
the 
Project 
However, 
as 
a 
proportion 
of 
rural 
expenditures, 
the 
project 
has 
a 
larger impact. 
As 
shown, 
it 
amounts 
to 
4.3 
percent 
of 
overall 
projected 
expenditures. 
Moreover 
this 
figure 
might 
be underestimated, 
because 
here we 
are 
assuming 
that 
expenditures 
per 
student 
do 
not 
vary between 
rural 
and 
urban 
areas. 
Currently, 
rural 
expenditures 
per 
pupil 
are 
probably 
lower 
than 
in 
urban 
areas, 
so 
the 
increase 
in 
expenditures 
related 
to 
this 
project 
may 
even 
be 
more 
significant 
in 
relation 
to 
what 
is 
currently 
spent 
in 
these 
areas.

The 
impact 
of 
the 
project 
in 
terms 
of 
future 
commitments 
can 
be 
also analyzed 
looking 
at 
the type 
of 
expenditures. 
We 
divided 
recurrent 
costs 
and 
implicit 
costs 
of 
the 
intervention 
in 
initial 
and 
primary 
education,  separating 
future 
costs 
in 
terms 
of 
goods 
and 
services 
(training, 
workbooks, 
textbooks, 
materials) 
from 
future 
expenditures 
in 
personnel 
(animadoras, 
coordinators, 
teachers 
required 
for 
increase 
in 
access, 
administrators 
of 
networks)

As 
a 
percentage 
of 
projected current 
expenditures 
in 
goods 
and 
services 
in 
rural 
areas, 
the 
recurrent 
costs 
of 
the 
project 
in 
goods and services 
in 
2007 
and 
2008 
are 
relatively 
large 
(17 
percent), 
although they later 
fall. 
Even 
if 
in 
absolute 
terms 
the 
amount 
involved 
(around 
US$ 
11 
million 
per 
year) 
is 
not 
large, 
this 
shows 
that 
a 
change 
of 
priorities 
is 
required, 
such 
that the 
GOP 
commits 
to 
increase 
expenditures 
in 
categories 
different 
than 
salaries 
in 
rural 
areas. 
This 
commitment 
is 
even 
larger 
if 
the 
program 
expands 
to 
other 
departments. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
additional 
personnel, 
the 
increase 
in 
expenditures 
is 
very 
small 
compared 
to 
what 
is 
currently 
spent. 
However, 
it 
should be 
expected 
that the 
expenditures 
in 
personnel 
increase 
sharply 
in 
the 
eras 
of 
intervention 
of 
the 
reform 
in 
teachers career

would 
partially 
finance 
the 
cost 
of 
infrastructure 
design 
and 
works 
for 
the

of 
the 
Infrastructure 
Sub-projects. 
Infrastructure

for 
the 
expansion 
and/or 
rehabilitation 
of 
approximately 
1,900 
classrooms 
and 
auxiliary facilities 
(offices, 
cooking 
and sanitariums) 
totaling 
US$ 
22.25 
million

All 
of 
the contracts 
for 
these 
works 
will 
be procured 
by 
the 
Fondo 
Nacional 
de 
Compensacicin 
y

(FONCODES) 
and 
awarded 
to 
Nucleos 
Ejecutores 
through 
Direct 
Contracting 
and the 
use 
of 
a 
Community Participation 
approach. 
A 
description 
of 
this 
procedure 
is 
summarized 
below. 
A 
detailed  description 
of 
procedures 
to 
be 
followed 
will 
be 
included 
in 
the 
Operational 
Manual 
of 
the project. 
In 
specific 
rural 
locations 
(1 
16  heads 
of 
educational  networks)  the  expansionhehabilitation 
of 
educational 
classrooms 
will 
encompass 
also 
the 
construction 
of 
multi-service Modules 
comprised 
of 
complementary 
areas 
such 
as 
administrative 
offices, 
teacher 
meeting 
rooms, 
learning-distance 
classrooms, teacher 
training facilities 
and cooking.  Improvement 
of 
educational 
facilities 
incorporating 
multi-service 
modules 
will 
be 
carried out 
through 
contracts 
awarded 
to 
Nucleos 
Ejecutores 
and 
the 
use 
of 
a 
community 
approach. 
On 
the  basis 
of. 
a  standardized 
multi-service 
module 
design, 
the 
estimated 
cost 
of 
construction 
of 
multi-service 
module 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
approximately 
US$80,000. 
This 
amount 
is 
being 
proposed 
in 
Table 
B 
as 
the 
upper 
threshold 
for 
the 
use 
of 
the 
Community 
Procurement 
Method. 
Experience 
with 
small works 
in 
the 
rural 
areas 
of 
Peru 
has 
shown that 
procurement 
through 
contractors 
has 
not 
been successful 
mainly 
because 
of 
the 
relative small 
contract 
amounts 
(typically 
less 
than 
US$ 
60,000) 
for 
distant locations 
where 
transportation 
costs are 
made 
more expensive 
due 
to 
poor 
road 
quality. 
An 
alternative 
previously 
used 
by 
Bank 
projects 
has 
been 
the 
community contracting 
through 
the Peru’s 
Social Investment 
Fund, 
FONCODES, 
and 
it 
is 
the 
proposed 
strategy 
for 
implementation 
of 
works under 
this 
project. 
Below 
is 
a summary 
of 
the 
FONCODES project 
cycle. 
The  Operations 
Manual 
will 
include 
a 
detailed description 
of 
the 
Project 
Cycle to 
be 
implemented under 
this 
project. 
FONCODES 
has 
developed a 
project 
cycle which 
involves 
direct 
community  contracting 
which 
has 
proven 
to 
be 
quite 
successful 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
rural 
works 
and 
which 
has 
been 
reviewed 
in 
detail 
by 
the 
Bank 
as 
part 
of 
the 
implementation 
of 
two 
prior 
projects (FONCODES and 
FONCODES 
11). 
The 
project cycle 
was 
reviewed 
under 
the 
preparation 
of 
this 
project 
and 
also 
under the preparation 
of 
an 
IDB 
financed 
loan 
(FONCODES 
III) 
in 
order 
to 
introduce 
sustainability 
measures 
at 
the 
onset 
of 
the 
project 
cycle. 
The project 
cycle 
starts 
when the 
community 
elects (through

2) 
Prior 
review 
thresholds 
The 
proposed thresholds 
for prior 
review 
are 
based 
primarily 
on 
the 
findings 
of 
the 
capacity 
assessment 
exercises 
carried out 
at each 
implementing 
unit 
during 
project 
appraisal 
mission 
and 
in 
past 
performance 
of 
the 
same 
units 
to 
be involved 
in 
project 
implementation.  They have 
been summarized 
in 
Table 
B 
per 
each 
type 
of 
procurement 
contract. 
In 
addition 
to 
prior 
review 
of 
individual 
procurement 
actions, each 
project 
u,nit’s 
Procurement Plan 
and budget 
for 
the 
PCU 
Operating Costs 
will 
be reviewed 
and 
approved 
annually 
by 
the 
Bank. 
B) 
Assessment 
of 
the 
agency’s 
capacity 
to 
implement procurement 
Overall 
project 
coordination 
and 
management 
of 
procurement 
for 
purchasing 
of 
goods 
and 
services, 
and 
contracting 
of 
consultant 
services 
will 
be carried 
out 
by 
the  PCU, 
in 
close coordination 
with 
the 
Vice-Ministry 
of 
Pedagogical 
Management 
of 
the 
MED. 
Implementation 
of 
the 
Infrastructure 
Sub-projects 
Component 
will 
be 
coordinated 
by FONCODES 
following 
an 
institutional 
agreement 
to 
be 
entered 
with 
the 
MED. 
FONCODES 
will 
manage 
all 
component 
related 
activities 
including inter alia 
community contracting; 
works supervision and 
funds 
transferred 
to 
Nucleos Ejecutores. 
Close 
coordination 
should be 
kept 
with 
OINFE, 
the 
MEDs 
Unit 
responsible 
for 
development 
and maintenance 
of 
educational infrastructure, 
as 
this 
unit 
will 
be responsible 
for 
the 
carrying 
out 
of 
specific 
sub-project preparation 
activities 
at 
up-front 
stages 
in 
the 
project 
cycle, 
like 
demand 
identification; 
sub-project site 
validation 
and 
soil 
studies; 
and 
definition 
of 
scope 
of 
works 
and 
technical  specifications 
for  rural 
school 
rehabilitation 
designs 
and 
multi-service module 
prototype 
designs, 
among other 
tasks. 
As 
part 
of 
project 
appraisal, 
the 
Bank 
team 
carried out 
agency 
capacity 
assessment 
exercises 
at 
PCU 
and 
FONCODES  aimed 
at 
reviewing 
their 
current capacity  and assigning 
a 
level 
of 
risk 
to 
administer 
procurement functions 
and other 
administrative related 
tasks. 
- 
72 
- 
Page  79
Both 
units 
have 
managed 
Bank-financed projects 
in 
the 
past 
with 
satisfactory 
results 
and 
this 
assessment 
exercise 
has 
confirmed 
that  they 
keep 
holding 
in 
place 
an 
adequate 
capacity 
to 
manage 
project 
procurement 
in 
a 
satisfactory 
manne. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
findings 
identified, 
an 
AVERAGE 
risk 
level 
has 
been assigned 
to 
each 
implementing 
agency, 
and specific 
plan 
of 
actions 
defined 
for 
implementation. 
Implementation 
of 
the 
latter 
tool 
will 
aim 
at 
improving their overall 
performance and 
thus 
reducing 
their 
current 
level 
of 
risk 
to 
carry out procurement functions, 
and 
Bank 
supervision 
effort 
as 
well. 
Therefore, 
upgrading 
of 
risk 
assessment 
levels 
will 
be 
primarily 
contingent 
on 
a successful 
implementation 
of 
activities included 
in 
each 
action 
plan. 
Among 
common relevant 
risks 
identified 
at each agency are 
the 
lack 
of 
an 
integrated 
MIS 
which 
could 
be 
otherwise 
helpful 
in 
monitoring 
and 
control 
project 
performance, 
decision 
making 
and 
progress 
reporting. 
Therefore, 
implementation 
of 
a 
MIS 
has 
been 
included 
in 
the 
proposed 
action 
plan 
at 
each 
agency. 
Also, 
both 
agencies 
need 
to 
increase 
their 
current 
capacity 
to 
organize, 
manage 
and 
file 
project 
documents 
in 
order 
to 
enable 
project 
auditing 
and 
Bank 
supervision 
tasks. 
Preparation 
of 
TOR 
for 
the 
contracting 
of 
specialized consultants 
and 
implementation 
of 
a 
modem 
and 
professional 
filing 
system 
at 
each agency 
are tasks 
incorporated 
in 
each agency’s 
action 
plan. 
Provision 
of 
Bank 
procurement 
training 
is 
strongly 
recommended 
since 
it 
has 
not 
been made 
available 
at 
either 
agency 
since 
early 
1999, 
as 
reported 
by 
agency 
staff 
involved 
in 
project 
procurement. 
Staff 
turnover, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
changes 
introduced 
by 
the new Government 
administration 
in 
both 
agencies, 
is 
another element 
that 
justifies 
to 
a 
large extent  procurement training. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
FONCODES specific activities, 
like 
overall 
review 
and 
adjustment 
of 
its 
project cycle 
have 
been 
included 
in 
its 
proposed 
action 
plan 
as 
key 
to 
ensure 
in 
turn 
adequate 
component 
coordination 
and 
successful 
implementation 
of 
tasks 
to 
be 
executed 
directly 
by 
Nucleos 
Ejecutores. 
Primary 
review 
objectives  should 
focus  on 
fine-tuning 
the 
role 
of 
FONCODES 
as 
implementing 
agency 
of 
the 
Infrastructure 
Sub-project  Component 
and 
on 
increasing  quality/frequency 
of 
works  supervision; 
monitoring 
of 
procurement 
processes 
directly 
executed 
by 
participating 
educational communities; 
and 
use 
of 
funds 
transferred funds 
by 
FONCODES. 
Sustainability 
of 
investments 
is 
also a 
relevant feature 
in 
reviewing 
this 
entity’s 
project 
cycle. 
The 
FONCODES’s 
procurement improvement  action 
plan 
indicates  that 
a 
detailed 
description 
of 
community 
procedures 
under 
Direct 
Contracting 
to 
be 
followed 
by 
participating 
communities 
(Nucleos 
Ejecutores) 
for 
rehabilitation 
and 
expansion 
of 
school 
facilities, 
and 
construction 
of 
multi-service 
educational 
modules 
be 
included 
in 
the 
Project 
Operational 
Manual 
by 
loan 
effectiveness. 
The proposed 
Procurement 
Improvement 
Action 
Plans were 
submitted 
by 
IvlED 
and 
FONCODES 
prior 
to 
negotiations and 
were 
deemed 
satisfactory 
by 
the Bank. 
C) 
Procurement 
Plan 
During 
appraisal 
mission, 
implementing 
agencies 
submitted 
to 
the 
mission 
for 
review 
and 
comments 
procurement 
plans 
for 
the 
first 
year 
of 
project 
implementation. 
Both 
plans 
were 
prepared 
following 
guidelines 
and 
sample 
formats 
provided 
by 
the 
Bank. 
Upon 
review 
and 
incorporation 
of 
Bank-recommended 
adjustments 
both 
plans 
are 
considered satisfactory. 
They 
will 
be 
submitted 
to 
the 
FWA 
Office for 
review 
and 
clearance 
prior 
to 
negotiations. 
Preliminary 
versions

STRATEGY TO 
INCLUDE INDIGENOUS 
COMMUNITIES 
IN 
THE 
RURAL 
EDUCATION 
PROJECT 
PERU: 
Rural Education 
Project 
I. 
BACKGROUND 
1. 
LEGAL FRAMEWORK 
The Peruvian 
legal 
framework includes 
the 
right 
of 
indigenous 
peoples 
to 
education 
in 
various 
legal 
instances. 
Peruvian norms 
in 
this 
respect 
are 
included 
in 
the 
political 
constitution 
of 
the 
nation, 
the 
General Education Act, 
the 
Primary 
Education Regulations 
and the recent 
regulations creating 
in 
the 
National 
Inter-cultural 
Bilingual 
Education Directorate 
and 
its 
Consultative 
Council. 
Article 
2, 
of 
Peru’s 
Political 
Constitution 
mentions 
that 
all 
individuals 
have 
the 
right 
to 
preserve 
their 
ethnic 
and 
cultural identity; 
that 
the Peruvian 
state 
recognizes and 
protects ethnic and 
cultural 
plurality 
in 
the 
nation; 
that 
bilingual 
and 
inter-cultural 
education 
must 
be 
fostered, 
recognizing 
each  area’s 
characteristics 
while 
preserving 
the 
various 
cultural 
and 
language 
manifestations. 
Peru 
has 
signed 
ILO’S 
169 
Agreement 
(ratified 
in 
1993) 
recognizing 
the 
right 
of 
indigenous boys 
and 
girls 
to 
learn 
to 
read and 
write 
in 
their 
own 
language, 
and preserve 
and develop 
it. 
It 
also recognizes the 
right 
of 
indigenous 
peoples 
to 
be 
consulted 
about 
state measures 
aimed 
at 
accomplishing 
these 
goals. 
Likewise, 
Peru 
has 
signed 
the 
Universal Declaration 
of 
Human 
Rights, 
article 
26 
of 
which 
establishes 
that  education 
will 
have 
as 
its 
objective  the 
achievement 
of 
full 
individual 
development,  and 
to 
strengthen 
respect 
for 
human 
rights 
and 
fundamental 
freedoms 
while 
fostering 
understanding, 
tolerance 
and 
friendship 
among 
all 
nations 
and 
ethnic or 
religious 
groups. 
Peru 
has 
also 
signed the 
Convention 
on 
the 
Rights 
of 
Children, 
article 
29 
of 
which 
mentions that children’s education 
must 
be 
destined 
to 
create 
in 
them 
respect 
for 
their 
own 
cultural identity, their 
language and values 
while 
preparing 
them 
to 
lead 
a 
responsible 
life 
in 
a 
free 
society, 
where 
the 
spirit 
of 
understanding, 
peace, 
tolerance, 
gender 
equality, and 
friendship 
among 
peoples, 
ethnic, 
national 
and 
religious 
groups 
and 
peoples 
of 
indigenous roots 
will 
be 
preserved. 
The 
General 
Education 
Act, 
in 
article 
4 
(d), 
specifies that 
preferential 
attention 
will 
be 
given 
to 
marginalized 
sectors, 
border 
areas, 
rural 
areas 
and 
population 
groups where 
native 
languages 
and other 
similar 
situations 
are 
predominant. 
Article 
5 
(c) 
mentions that  cooperation 
and 
exchange 
with 
other 
cultures, 
in 
particular 
the 
culture 
of 
other 
Latin 
American 
nations, 
will 
be 
fostered 
while 
preserving 
national 
independence 
and 
identity, 
and 
fostering the 
study 
of 
those 
nations’ 
living 
languages. 
To 
achieve the 
above 
goals, 
the 
new 
Primary 
Education Regulations 
crate the 
means 
to 
provide 
Andean 
and 
Amazonian communities 
with 
inter-cultural 
bilingual 
education 
schools, 
with 
education 
provided 
in 
the 
indigenous mother tongue 
and Spanish 
progressively 
taught 
as 
a 
second language, 
thus 
helping to 
build 
among 
the 
students 
a stronger language and 
cultural identity 
in 
the framework 
of 
the 
nation’s 
life. 
On 
April 
2, 
2001, 
Supreme 
Decree 
No. 
018-2001-ED 
created 
the 
National 
Inter-cultural 
Bilingual 
Education 
Directorate 
(DINEBI in 
Spanish) 
to 
provide quality 
solutions 
to 
meet 
the educational 
needs 
and 
demands 
of 
a 
multicultural 
and 
multilingual 
nation, 
such 
as 
Peru, 
at 
all 
levels 
and 
for 
all 
types 
of 
education. 
On 
May 
22 
of 
the 
same 
year, 
Ministerial 
Resolution 235-2001-ED 
created 
the 
National 
Consultative Committee 
to 
promote 
greater 
involvement 
of 
civil 
society and 
direct 
beneficiaries 
in 
Page  95
inter-cultural 
bilingual 
education. 
This 
committee includes outstanding 
representatives 
of 
the 
teaching 
profession 
from 
the 
Aguaruna, 
Shipibo, 
AshBninka, 
Aymara 
and 
Quechua nations, 
as 
well 
as 
Peruvian 
experts 
in 
anthropology, education 
and 
linguistics. 
Recruitment 
of 
bilingual 
teachers 
is 
regulated 
by 
Directive 
002-2002-CNCP-ED 
according 
to 
which 
teachers 
will 
be 
appointed 
to 
inter-cultural 
bilingual 
schools 
only 
if 
they  have demonstrated 
written 
fluency 
in 
the 
respective indigenous 
language. 
In 
all 
cases, 
the 
selection 
criterion 
will 
be 
the 
relationship 
between the 
students  and 
their 
language. 
The  Selection Committee that 
recruits 
teachers, 
include 
a 
representative 
of 
the 
local 
indigenous 
federation. 
In 
addition, 
Vice 
Ministerial 
Resolution 
025-96-ED 
determines that 
to 
be 
hired 
as 
bilingual 
educators, 
teachers 
must 
be trained 
in 
inter-cultural 
bilingual 
education, 
talk 
the mother 
language spoken 
by 
the 
local 
children 
and 
be 
fully 
identified 
and 
committed 
to 
the 
children 
and 
community 
where 
they 
will 
work. 
2. 
ETHNIC 
AND 
CULTURAL CONTEXT 
2.1 
Our 
peoples 
The Peruvian 
nation 
is 
made 
up 
of 
a 
range 
of 
ethnic, 
cultural 
and language groups. Peru’s 
population 
- 
estimated 
at 
about 
24 
million 
- 
is 
mostly mixed. 
More 
than 
8 
million 
Peruvians 
belong 
to 
indigenous 
nations, 
mostly 
Quechua 
and 
Aymara 
living 
in 
the Andean region. The Peruvian Amazon forest 
covers 
62 
percent 
of 
the 
territory 
and 
is 
home 
to 
42  ethnolinguistic 
groups 
whose 
cultural, 
economic and 
political 
characteristics 
are 
obviously 
different 
from 
those 
of 
the 
national 
population. 
Such 
cultural 
variety 
spans 
factors 
such 
as 
culture, 
lifestyles, 
language, 
demographics, 
relation 
to 
the 
territory 
and 
contact 
andor 
interaction 
with 
society 
at 
large 
and 
the 
national 
juridical 
order. 
The 
universe 
of 
indigenous 
peoples 
is 
not 
restricted 
to 
peasant 
and 
native 
communities. 
It 
also 
includes 
remote 
settlements, 
and 
groups 
that 
have 
voluntarily 
decided 
to 
isolate 
themselves 
or 
who 
only 
establish 
sporadic contact 
with 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
country.  There 
is 
an 
undetermined number 
of 
individuals 
of 
indigenous roots 
living 
in 
Amazon 
cities 
or 
rural 
areas, 
who 
are 
known 
as 
the 
riverside 
population. 
A 
greater 
recognition 
is 
required 
of 
the 
rights 
of 
those peoples 
who 
do 
not 
explicitly 
identify 
themselves 
as 
native, indigenous nations or 
members 
of 
a 
given 
language 
group, 
other than the 
1265 
peasant 
and 
native 
communities 
identified 
and 
registered 
by 
the 
Peruvian 
government. 
2.2 
Our 
languages 
Peru’s 
official 
languages 
are 
Spanish, 
as 
well 
as 
Quechua, 
Aymara and Amazon 
languages 
in 
locations 
where 
they 
are 
predominant. 
Quechua 
is 
spoken 
by 
4 
million 
people 
while 
there 
are 
some 
350,000 
Aymara 
speakers. 
In 
the Amazon 
region 
between 
300,000 
and 
400,000 
people 
speak 
any 
of 
the 
40 
Amazonian 
languages 
grouped 
in 
16  language 
families, 
i.e. 
Arabela,  Arahuaca,  Bora,  Chafil-pana, 
Candoshi-Zarpa, 
Harakmbut, 
Huitoto, 
Jibaro, 
Pano, 
Peba-yagua, 
Simaco, 
Tacana, 
Ticuana,  Tucano, 
Tupi-Guarani 
and 
Zaparo. 
Some 
100,000 
people 
speak 
a 
foreign 
language.

population

EXIECUTIVE SUMMARY 
OF 
THE 
BENEFICIARIES’ 
ASSESSMENT 
The 
beneficiaries’ 
assessment 
comprised 
two 
stages. 
During 
the 
first 
stage, 
running 
from 
the 
second 
semester 
1999 
to 
April 
2000, 
was 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
Bilingual 
Inter-cultural 
Education 
Training 
Program 
(PROEIB 
Andes 
in 
Spanish) based 
in 
the 
city 
of 
Cochabamba, 
Bolivia. 
During 
this 
period, 
visits 
to 
bilingual 
schools 
in 
the 
departments 
of 
Puno, 
Cuzco, 
Ancash, 
San 
Martin, 
and 
Amazonas 
provided 
information 
about 
teacher and student 
performance. 
In 
addition, 
bilingual 
training 
was 
evaluated 
during 
a 
workshop 
with 
teacher trainers. 
The 
activity 
brought 
together 
approximately 
120 
teachers 
from 
various 
Andean 
and 
Amazonian  regions 
around 
Peru. 
The  opinions 
of 
parents, 
teachers 
and 
training 
organizations (executing 
agents) 
were 
another 
source 
of 
information. 
From March 
to 
May 
2001, 
the 
second 
stage 
of 
the 
evaluation 
focused on 
the 
Inter-cultural 
Bilingual 
Education 
policy 
guidelines, 
and 
the 
text  books 
and 
materials prepared 
by 
the former 
UNEBI, 
now 
renamed 
as 
DINEBI. 
The 
recommendations 
from 
this 
evaluation 
have 
been 
used 
in 
the 
design and 
proposed implementation 
of 
the 
Project. 
Peru 
has 
undergone 
an 
education 
reform 
that 
introduced 
a 
more active 
and 
horizontal 
teaching 
approach 
called 
the 
New 
EducationaE 
Approach. 
Some 
changes 
were 
readily 
observed 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
evaluation. 
3.1 
Teaching practice 
Findings 
and 
results 
from 
these 
two 
assessment stages 
include 
the 
following: 
Findings 
concerning: 
the 
students’ 
organization 
and 
classroom design 
Teachers 
organize 
classrooms 
in 
a 
less 
rigid 
manner 
than 
the 
traditional 
face-to-face 
approach. 
Even 
when 
classroom 
furniture 
made 
it 
difficult 
to 
rearrange the 
students 
around 
the 
classroom, 
these 
were 
redesigned 
to 
give 
an 
emphasis 
to 
and 
facilitate 
teamwork. 
Very 
few 
classrooms were 
found 
where 
students were 
organized 
in 
the 
traditional row-and-line 
organization. However, and 
despite 
the 
ongoing 
changes, 
most 
teachers 
failed to 
move around 
the 
classes 
and 
rather 
chose 
to 
teach 
their 
classes 
from 
the 
front 
of 
the 
room 
and 
with 
their 
backs 
to 
the blackboard. 
Findings 
concerning the 
relationshiu 
between 
teachers 
and 
students and the 
uarticiuation 
of 
bow 
and 
gi& 
The 
classrooms 
environment 
is 
more 
open and 
horizontal, 
and 
fosters 
increased 
involvement 
of 
boys and 
girls. 
Additionally, 
the 
use 
of 
the 
students’ 
mother tongue gives 
students 
more security 
and 
confidence. 
However 
it 
is 
also 
important 
to 
acknowledge that 
greater 
involvement 
depended 
to 
a 
large extent 
on 
the 
permanent 
stimulus 
and 
direction  provided 
by 
the 
teacher. 
Additionally, 
some 
teachers 
did 
show 
discriminating 
and 
physically 
abusive 
behavior towards children. 
Findings 
concerning classroom 
work 
styles 
Teachers 
still 
almost 
totally control 
education 
processes 
in 
the classroom and 
give 
instructions 
in 
a 
top-down 
style 
with 
few 
opportunities 
for 
reflection 
and 
even 
less 
for 
metacongnition. 
Routine 
actions 
and 
schemes 
evidence 
the 
control 
and 
domination  functions 
exerted 
by 
teachers. 
The 
most  salient 
classwork 
aspects 
are 
described 
below: 
- 
92

Page  99
Teaching 
Materials 
Diversification 
of 
teaching materials 
is 
still 
incipient. 
In 
many 
instances, 
the 
only 
materials 
used 
in 
the 
classroom 
are 
chalk 
and a blackboard, 
except 
in 
some 
cases 
when 
the 
teacher 
uses 
flip 
charts and markers 
while 
students 
do 
teamwork. 
Also, 
in 
a 
significant 
number 
of 
classrooms, 
posters 
and 
illustrations 
prepared 
by 
teachers 
and 
students 
decorate 
the 
walls. 
Most 
teachers 
appreciated 
the 
workbooks 
prepared 
and 
distributed 
by 
UNEBI, 
although 
in 
some 
cases 
they 
were 
not 
yet 
using 
them. 
Most 
survey 
respondents 
mentioned that workbooks 
were 
slow 
to 
reach 
them. 
The 
most 
widely 
used 
by 
both 
teachers 
and 
students 
were 
for 
logic 
and 
mathematics, 
while 
comprehensive 
communication workbooks 
were 
little 
used 
because 
of 
the 
language 
barrier. 
Use 
of 
languages 
Major 
changes 
were 
observed 
concerning 
the 
use 
of 
languages 
in 
the 
classrooms. 
Generally 
speaking, 
in 
the 
surveyed 
area, 
when the 
students 
spoke 
predominantly 
a 
vernacular 
language, 
classwork 
was 
done 
in 
that 
language, 
whether 
Aymara, 
Quechua 
or 
Aguaruna. 
Class 
sessions 
generally 
were conducted 
in 
the 
vernacular 
language and 
in 
Spanish, 
alternatively. 
In 
the Andean 
area, 
the 
simultaneous 
use 
of 
two 
languages 
in 
the classroom apparently 
depends 
on 
the 
teacher’s 
decision and 
also 
possibly on 
the 
parents’ pressure 
to 
use Spanish. 
This 
simultaneous 
use 
of 
the 
two 
languages 
is 
disorganized 
and, 
in 
some 
cases, 
requires translating 
or 
rewording. 
Also 
this 
situation 
seems 
to 
result 
from 
insufficient work 
materials 
in 
Spanish 
as 
a 
second language, 
and 
little 
methodological 
training 
for 
teachers 
so 
that  they 
can 
clearly 
establish 
the 
difference 
between 
teaching 
a language and 
teaching 
in 
a 
given 
language. 
Although 
the 
vernacular 
language 
is 
used 
in 
teaching, 
there 
is 
no 
thinking 
about 
it, 
nor 
is 
its 
conscious 
and 
reflective 
use 
promoted beyond 
simply learning 
to 
write 
it. 
Still 
introducing 
vernacular 
languages 
in 
study programs 
seems 
to 
have created, 
albeit 
in 
a 
limited 
manner, 
an awareness 
of 
their 
value. 
Inter-cultural 
dimension 
in 
the 
classroom 
Teacher  have 
multiple difficulties 
when 
trying 
to 
introduce 
the 
multicultural 
dimension 
in 
a 
practical 
way. 
Although 
teachers 
may have 
been 
trained 
in 
the 
theoretical 
and 
conceptual 
aspects, 
there 
is 
a 
manifest 
need 
for 
specific teaching guidelines 
to 
introduce 
a 
more horizontal 
communication 
approach 
and 
enforce 
inter-cultural 
teaching 
in 
everyday 
classroom work. 
Nevertheless, 
some teachers 
already 
use 
local 
knowledge 
and wisdom, 
although 
incipiently. 
Evaluation 
Evaluation 
is 
one 
of 
the 
areas 
that 
has 
received the least attention 
as 
teachers 
or 
experts 
from 
teaching 
organizations 
do 
not 
include 
it 
in 
the regular teaching 
process. 
It 
has 
not 
yet 
become a 
continuing 
and 
permanent 
process, 
and 
traditional 
evaluation practices 
subsist. 
No 
cases 
of 
self-evaluation or 
peer 
evaluation 
were 
observed 
during 
the 
assessment. 
3.2. 
Boys 
and 
girls’ 
learning 
achievements 
A 
worrisome 
finding 
was 
that 
neither boys 
nor 
girls 
achieved the 
third 
level 
of 
reading 
and 
writing 
skills 
in 
the predominant 
language. 
In 
many 
instances, 
students were 
unable 
to 
read 
and 
write 
in 
the 
vernacular 
-

- 
Page  100
language. 
Similar, 
if 
not 
more 
severe 
issues, 
concern the 
use 
of 
Spanish 
as 
a 
second 
language. 
Although 
in 
many 
cases 
students 
were 
able 
to 
handle 
simple 
oral 
tasks 
related 
to 
basic 
social interaction, they had 
trouble 
describing 
a 
simple 
illustration 
using  complete 
and 
coherent 
phrases 
and 
sentences. 
Even 
greater 
difficulties 
were 
identified 
in 
reading 
comprehension and 
writing 
in 
the 
second language. 
Most 
students 
had trouble 
both 
reading 
and 
understanding 
a short 
academic 
piece. 
3.3 
Social and community 
participation 
Participation 
of 
parents and 
other 
members 
and 
leaders 
of 
the community 
at 
large 
in 
the 
education 
process 
in 
quite 
limited.  Their 
involvement 
is 
limited 
to 
maintenance 
or 
refurbishment 
of 
school 
facility 
and 
making additional 
financial 
contributions 
for 
specific 
purchases. 
More 
attention 
should be 
paid 
to 
this 
element 
to 
the extent 
social 
and 
community  involvement 
can have 
a 
major 
influence 
in 
creating 
acceptance 
for 
inter-cultural 
bilingual 
education 
(IBE) 
and 
determining 
the 
quality 
of 
IBE 
projects 
and 
programs. 
3.4 
Opinions 
on 
the 
program, 
its 
objectives and enforcement

4. 
Although 
inter-cultural 
bilingual 
education 
is 
widely 
accepted, teachers 
generally 
feel 
it 
is 
only 
a 
temporary 
way 
of 
using 
the 
Vernacular 
language 
in 
education 
during 
the 
students’ 
initial 
schooling 
and 
only 
until 
they 
have 
achieved 
sufficient 
mastery 
of 
Spanish. 
Teacher 
training 
time 
is 
insufficient 
considering 
all 
the 
components 
and 
tasks 
that 
need 
to 
be 
included. 
Training 
and 
on-site 
monitoring 
as 
well 
as 
the 
programs’ 
credibility 
are 
hurt 
by 
the 
trainers 
and 
specialist 
working 
in 
regional offices who do 
not 
speak 
the vernacular 
languages and 
lack 
experience 
in 
inter-cultural 
bilingual 
education 
(IBE). 
Parents 
and 
teachers 
must 
be 
further 
sensitized 
to 
IBE’s 
goals and 
objectives, and 
the 
advantages 
of 
using 
the 
students’ 
predominant 
language 
in 
education. 
Lack 
of 
information 
in 
this 
regard 
leads 
some 
to 
reject the 
IBE 
program. 
More 
coordination 
seems 
necessary 
among organizations 
charged 
with providing 
IBE 
training 
and 
regional 
and sub-regional specialists. 
For 
instance, 
teachers 
are 
relocated 
without 
due 
consideration 
to 
their 
IBE 
training. 
Not all 
IBE 
regional specialists 
speak 
the 
local 
vernacular 
language. 
In 
many 
cases, 
grade 
school 
experts were 
hired 
based 
on criteria 
that 
prioritized 
teaching 
in 
Spanish. 
Several respondents underscored the language component. 
Few 
referred 
to 
the 
cultural 
component, 
reflecting insufficient 
understanding 
about 
the 
inter-cultural 
nature 
of 
the 
IBE 
initiative. 
SUMMARY 
OF 
THE 
CONSULTATION 
PROCESS 
In 
order 
to 
include Inter-cultural 
bilingual 
education 
in 
the 
debate 
leading 
to 
the 
National 
Agreement 
on 
Education, 
a 
number 
of 
round 
tables and 
workshops examined the various 
experiences 
and 
contributions 
to 
the 
field 
of 
inter-cultural 
bilingual 
education 
in 
Peru and the region. 
This 
consultation 
process 
comprised 
several 
stages 
and 
involved 
various 
government 
and 
nongovernmental 
organizations, 
universities, 
inter-cultural 
and 
bilingual 
experts. 
Most 
importantly 
however, 
it 
included 
a 
substantial 
contribution 
by 
representatives 
from 
indigenous  and  native 
-

- 
Page  101
organizations, 
as 
well 
as 
prominent 
bilingual 
teachers 
from 
various countries 
across 
the 
region. 
4.1 
First 
Consultation Event 
The 
first 
consultation 
process 
revolved 
around 
“Education 
and 
the Challenge 
of 
Diversity.” 
It 
involved 
participants 
from 
indigenous  organizations 
from 
the 
Andean 
and  Amazon 
regions, 
community 
federations,  associations, 
regional 
organizations, 
bilingual 
teachers, 
nongovemmental 
organizations, 
universities, 
inter-cultural 
and 
bilingual 
experts, 
a 
representative 
from 
the 
Congressional Education 
Commission, 
one 
from 
the 
Office 
of 
the 
Ombudsman 
and 
another 
from 
the 
Ministry 
for 
Women 
and 
Social Development. 
A 
working 
document 
on 
“Education  and 
challenges 
of 
diversity. 
Contributions 
from 
Zndigenous 
Peoples 
to the 
National 
Agreement 
on 
Education” 
was 
reviewed 
by 
the 
participants 
in 
the 
event. 
The 
modifications,  corrections 
and  suggestions 
are 
included 
in 
a 
publication 
called 
“The 
challenges 
of 
diversity.” 
In 
its 
first 
section, 
it 
includes 
a 
number 
of 
thoughts 
and 
proposals concerning diversity, 
exclusion, 
and 
education 
needs. 
In 
its 
second chapter, 
it 
proposes 
several actions 
to 
meet 
the 
challenge 
of 
such 
diversity. 
4.2 
Second 
consultation 
event 
The 
second 
consultation 
centered 
on 
the 
“Policies and 
Strategies 
for 
Inter-cultural 
Bilingual 
Education.” 
It 
took 
place 
in 
May 
2001 
and 
had 
as 
main 
topic the 
debate 
on 
the 
policy 
guidelines 
of 
the 
Inter-cultural 
bilingual 
education. 
The 
working 
commissions discussed a 
number 
of 
policy 
guidelines 
in 
the 
following 
areas: 
Inter-cultural 
issues 
Curriculum 
Pre- and 
in- 
service 
teacher 
training 
Materials 
Research 
Preschool and 
primary 
education 
Secondary 
education 
Adult 
education 
Organization 
and 
management 
of 
IBE 
The indigenous 
groups represented 
in 
the 
commissions 
made 
a 
number 
of 
significant 
contributions. 
For 
instance, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
debate 
and 
consultations, the 
document 
on 
national 
language 
and 
culture 
policy 
on 
education 
was 
prepared, 
including 
general and 
specific 
policy 
guidelines 
to 
enhance 
the 
quality 
of 
education 
based 
on 
the 
principles 
of 
respect 
and 
acceptance 
of 
Peru’s 
cultural 
and language 
diversity. 
The 
policy 
proposing active and 
additive 
bilingualism 
as 
well 
as 
an 
inter-cultural 
approach 
as 
guiding 
principles 
of 
Peruvian education 
is 
on 
the way 
to 
becoming new 
Law 
of 
Languages 
and 
part 
of 
the 
new 
General Education 
Law. 
4.3.

IBE’s 
National 
Consultative Council 
Since 
its 
organization 
in 
May 
2001, 
the 
Council 
has 
prepared 
a 
final 
document 
on 
Peru’s 
National Policy 
on  Cultures 
in 
Education, 
and 
has 
proposed 
it 
as 
one 
of 
the  conceptual  underpinnings 
of 
Peru’s 
educational 
policy. 
4.5 
Consultations 
with 
SETAI 
The 
Inter-cultural 
Bilingual 
Education 
National  Directorate 
actively 
participated 
in 
the 
consultation 
process 
promoted 
by 
the 
Technical 
Secretariat 
for 
Indigenous 
Affairs 
(SETAI) 
with 
support 
from 
the 
World 
Bank 
during 
the 
period 
1998 
- 
2000. 
Now, 
this 
technical 
secretariat 
reports 
to 
the 
National 
Commission 
for 
the 
Andean 
and 
Amazon 
Peoples 
presided 
by 
Peru’s 
First 
Lady, 
which, 
in 
turn, 
reports 
directly 
to 
the 
Prime 
Minister.

STRATEGY COMPONENTS 
5. 
FUTURE CONSULTATION 
AND 
COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION 
PROGRAMS 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
has set 
itself 
the 
goal 
of 
strengthening a democratic 
culture 
in 
the Peruvian 
education 
system 
to 
create 
a more active 
and 
equitable citizenry. 
This 
implies improving 
the 
relationships 
between 
the 
state 
and the 
indigenous 
peoples, and 
also 
putting 
a number 
of 
resources 
into 
operation 
so 
that 
joint 
management 
and 
responsibility 
sharing 
in 
education 
will 
become a 
reality. 
Indigenous 
organizations, 
the 
educational community 
and 
civil 
society 
at 
large 
need 
to 
become 
actively 
involved 
in 
developing 
IBE 
proposals, 
in 
order 
to 
obtain 
active 
contribution 
from 
these 
organizations 
for 
the 
design, 
execution 
and 
evaluation 
of 
educational activities. 
This 
will 
be 
implemented 
by 
means 
of 
a 
consultation 
process 
that 
will 
also 
include 
all 
educational 
regional 
and 
provincial 
directorates. 
These 
initiatives 
will 
be 
complementary 
to 
the 
rural 
community 
participation 
strategies 
to 
meet 
the 
goals 
of 
improving 
and strengthening organizational 
management 
of 
education 
within 
schools 
with 
active 
involvement 
of 
parents, 
community 
members 
and 
officials 
through 
School 
Council, 
education networks, 
and 
all 
district, 
provincial 
and 
regional 
levels 
of 
government. 
Indigenous 
peoples 
will 
likewise 
become 
active 
at 
these 
levels 
of 
community participation.

Round Tables 
Between 
2004 and 
2007,28 
debate 
and 
consensus 
round 
tables, 
focusing 
on educational topics 
for 
each 
indigenous 
people, 
will 
be 
organized 
in 
the departments 
of 
Loreto,  Ucayali, 
San 
Martin, 
Amazonas, 
Puerto Maldonado, 
Junin-Pasco, 
Ancash, 
Apurimac, 
Ayacucho, 
Puno, 
Huancavelica, 
Madre 
de 
Dios, 
Lambayeque, 
Tacna, 
Moquegua 
and 
Arequipa. 
The 
round 
tables 
will 
focus 
on 
the relevance 
of 
language 
and 
cultural 
issues 
in 
education, 
with 
the 
purpose 
of 
proposing guidelines 
for 
the educational 
development 
plans 
for 
each 
of 
the 
participating 
indigenous 
peoples. 
They should 
also 
contribute 
to 
the 
diversification 
of 
the 
curriculum 
and 
matching 
student 
profiles 
to 
their 
respective cultures, 
languages, 
lifestyles 
and 
development 
approaches. 
Moreover, 
the 
round 
tables 
will 
perform 
a 
social  oversight 
function 
on 
the 
appropriate 
use 
of 
contracts 
and 
resources. 
5.2 
Regional Consultative 
Councils 
Regional 
Consultative  Councils 
will 
be 
promoted 
in 
educational  regions  and 
subregions 
with 
participation 
of 
representatives 
from 
organized  indigenous  communities, 
wherever 
appropriate. 
Indigenous 
peoples 
will 
be 
part 
of 
these 
councils  and 
will 
perform 
functions 
similar to 
those 
of 
the 
National 
Consultative 
Council 
of 
Inter-cultural 
Bilingual 
Education 
established 
through 
Ministerial 
Resolution 
235-2001-ED. 
The 
Consultative Regional Councils 
will 
assess 
and evaluate the 
management 
of 
education, check 
the 
use 
of 
resources, and 
prepare 
educational 
policy 
guidelines 
for 
government 
regional 
educational 
officials, 
including 
recommendations 
and 
corrective 
actions 
for 
the 
Regional Education 
Directorates' 
operations. 
5.3 
National 
Congresses 
for 
Bilingual 
Education 
Teachers 
Annual 
meetings 
of 
bilingual 
teachers, 
nationwide, who excel 
in 
teaching 
and 
in 
their relationship 
with 
the  community 
will 
be 
promoted. 
The 
purpose 
of 
these 
meetings 
will 
be 
to 
exchange 
teaching 
experiences, 
promote 
the 
emergence 
of 
classwork 
innovation 
and 
assess 
the 
progress 
made 
in 
the 
field 
of 
inter-cultural 
bilingual 
education 
in 
Peru, 
as 
well 
as 
specific 
progress 
in 
various 
curricular 
areas. 
Four 
such 
national 
congresses 
for 
bilingual 
education 
teachers 
have 
already 
taken 
place, 
from 
1998 
to 
2001, 
in 
Junin, 
Ayacucho, 
Pun0 
and 
Cuzco. 
The 
fifth 
national  Inter-cultural 
Bilingual 
Education 
Congress 
will 
take 
place 
in 
Lamas 
(San 
Martin) 
and 
will 
be organized 
by 
the Federation 
of 
Kechwa 
Indigenous 
Peoples 
from 
the 
San 
Martin 
Region 
- 
FEPIKRESAM. 
5.4 
Inter-Cultural 
Events 
for 
Students, Teachers and 
Parents 
Meetings 
and 
gathering 
of 
students, 
teachers 
and 
parents 
from 
Peru's  indigenous  populations,  the 
so-called 
Tinkuy 
jamborees, 
will 
be organized 
to 
improve 
inter-cultural 
skills 
for 
every 
day 
life. 
These 
meetings 
have 
taken 
place recently 
in 
the 
cities 
of 
Andahuaylas, 
Iquitos, Huanta, Huancayo and 
Pampas 
(Tayacaja, 
Huancavelica). 
At 
these 
meetings, 
participating

MATERIALS 
DESIGN 
AND 
TESTING 
Teaching materials 
for 
inter-cultural 
bilingual 
education 
are 
a substantive 
component 
of 
the 
strategy. 
From 
this 
viewpoint, 
initiatives 
are 
being 
considered 
for 
preparing 
and 
developing teaching materials 
for 
students, 
teachers, 
parents, and 
the 
community at 
large. 
6.1 
Student 
Materials 
One 
of 
DINEBI’s 
most 
important 
achievements 
has 
been 
to 
prepare and 
distribute 
educational 
material 
including 
workbooks 
for 
Language 
and 
Mathematics 
in 
the 
14. 
Andean  and  Amazon  vernacular 
languages. 
This 
material 
has 
been 
designed 
as 
a support and 
reinforcement 
for 
boys 
and 
girls’ 
leaming 
in 
these 
two 
key 
areas, 
in 
addition 
to 
social 
learning 
studies 
as 
well 
as 
science 
and 
environment. 
With 
respect 
to 
support 
material 
for 
second 
language, 
efforts 
are 
underway 
to 
prepare workbooks, posters and 
charts 
for 
the 
first 
two 
levels (cycle 
I) 
with 
a 
view 
at 
completing 
a 
series 
with 
advanced 
level 
materials 
(cycles 
11 
and 
III). 
After 
consultation 
with 
experts 
and recommendations 
from 
an 
independent evaluation, 
a 
validation 
process 
was 
launched 
for 
the Andean 
languages 
(Quechua and 
Aymara)  workbooks. 
This 
process 
will 
continue 
with 
the 
validation 
of 
materials prepared 
for 
the 
Amazonian 
languages. 
The testing tools 
are 
aimed 
at 
collecting 
data about the 
cultural, 
language and 
teaching relevance 
of 
the materials under 
review. 
The 
results 
from 
the 
validation 
will 
provide 
input 
to 
enhance 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
printed 
materials. 
Additionally, 
it 
is 
of 
utmost importance 
to 
start 
designing alternative materials 
so 
that the 
inter-cultural 
bilingual 
education proposal 
for 
multigrade  and  single 
teacher 
and  single 
teacher 
schools 
can 
be 
successfully tackled. 
DINEBI 
will 
prepare 
the educational materials modules 
for 
children 
in 
preschool 
and 
primary inter-cultural 
bilingual 
education 
using 
a 
self-paced methodology. 
These 
materials 
will 
be 
prepared 
using 
the vernacular 
languages 
as 
main 
languages 
of 
learning 
and 
in 
Spanish 
as 
the 
second 
language. 
The 
design 
process 
will 
adopt  a 
participatory 
approach 
involving 
regional 
teams 
and 
indigenous 
peoples. 
This 
dynamic 
approach 
will 
facilitate 
undertaking 
internal 
and 
external 
review 
processes, 
reprinting 
the materials 
and 
printing 
the 
final 
prototypes. 
Before 
they 
are 
delivered, 
these 
prototypes 
will 
be 
validated 
in 
the 
rural 
project 
intervention 
areas. 
DINEBI 
will 
prepare 
the 
educational material 
for 
students 
in 
a 
two-pronged 
strategy: 
A) 
Improving 
existing 
educational 
material 
This 
approach 
will 
consist 
in 
improving 
existing 
educational 
material 
prepared 
by 
DINEBI 
(workbooks) 
in 
14 
vernacular 
languages 
and 
in 
Spanish 
as 
a 
second 
language 
(Cycle 
I). 
DINEBI 
will 
also  start 
preparing complementary 
teaching, 
reading and 
writing 
material 
in 
vernacular 
languages 
as 
the 
main 
language 
of 
learning, 
and Spanish 
as 
a 
second 
language. 
This 
strategy 
will 
allow 
to 
cover 
85 
percent 
of 
demand 
by 
2005. 
Improving materials 
means: 
e 
e 
Validating 
and 
completing 
the 
production 
process 
of 
workbooks 
through 
the 
sixth 
grade 
for 
at 
least 
four major Amazon 
area 
languages, 
i.e. 
Aguaruna, 
Shipibo, AshAninka 
and 
Chayahuita. 
Adjusting 
and 
reprinting 
workbooks 
in 
the  Language and  Mathematics 
areas 
in 
nine 
Amazon 
languages 
and 
two 
Andean 
languages, 
including 
five 
Quechua 
dialects. 
Additionally, 
this 
will 
include 
Spanish 
language 
workbooks 
as 
a 
second 
language 
for 
boys and 
girls 
in 
the basic and

in 
the 
Andean 
area. 
Preparing 
complementary 
and 
support 
teacher 
materials 
to 
assist 
in

These 
materials 
include 
alphabet 
games, 
syllable 
roots 
and

boxes, 
word 
dominoes, 
word-fortune 
wheels, 
etc. 
Also 
materials 
for 
teaching 
the 
second 
language 
will 
be 
prepared 
including 
cards, 
posters, 
flip 
charts,  song

B) 
Validation 
and 
distribution 
of 
self-paced 
material 
This 
strategy aims 
at 
preparing 
and 
distributing 
educational 
material 
for 
a 
self-paced methodology 
as 
the 
first 
step 
in 
a process 
of 
innovation 
in 
coordination 
with 
the 
National 
Initial 
and 
Primary 
Education 
Directorate 
(DINEIP). 
The 
initial 
reference 
point 
will 
be 
the two-year  study cycle. Every 
year, 
the 
modules 
in 
vernacular 
languages 
and 
Spanish 
as 
a 
second 
language 
corresponding 
to 
the 
respective 
cycle 
will 
be 
prepared 
until 
the 
whole 
process 
has 
been 
finished 
and 
the materials 
can 
be delivered massively. 
Delivery 
of 
this 
type 
of 
material 
will 
increase 
gradually 
to 
cover 
all 
vernacular 
languages, 
as 
they become 
part 
of 
the 
Netwodts 
created 
in 
the 
Rural 
Education Project:

6.2 
Teachers’ 
materials 
In 
order 
to 
ensure 
that teaching 
of 
writing 
in 
indigenous 
languages 
is 
sustainable, 
Inter-cultural 
Bilingual 
Education 
teachers 
will 
be 
provided 
with 
a 
self-instruction 
manual that 
will 
give 
them 
the 
tools 
to 
better 
understand the 
writing 
and 
functioning 
of 
the 
main 
language 
used 
in 
classroom and instruction. 
These 
materials 
will 
support 
the 
distance 
teacher 
training initiative. 
Taking 
into 
account that 
classwork requires 
an 
ongoing 
training 
and 
methodological 
updating 
in 
IBE 
issues, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
use 
of 
proper teaching materials, 
each 
teacher 
will 
be supplied 
with 
the 
following 
handbooks: 
0 
0 
0 
0 
Handbooks 
for

Likewise, 
the 
project 
must 
ensure 
that 
teachers 
enforce 
inter-cultural principles 
in 
their 
pedagogical 
work 
in 
their 
schools,  and 
specifically 
in 
their 
classrooms. 
To 
do 
this, 
self-teaching 
handbooks 
relating to 
various 
components 
of 
this 
approach 
will 
be 
provided 
for 
Preschool, 
Primary 
and 
High 
School 
teachers. 
Six 
sets 
of 
guidelines, 
to 
be 
distributed 
gradually, 
are proposed:

Materials 
for 
parents 
and 
the 
community 
Materials 
for 
parents 
and 
the 
community, 
at 
large, 
will 
be prepared 
in 
14 
languages 
as 
part 
of 
a 
sensitization 
strategy 
to 
promote 
awareness 
on the 
advantages 
of 
IBE. 
These 
materials 
will 
support 
the 
dissemination 
strategy 
and 
will 
include 
leaflets, 
brochures, posters 
and 
radio 
broadcast 
spots, 
among 
others.

INTER-CULTURAL 
BILINGUAL 
TEACHER 
TRAINING 
Inter-cultural 
bilingual 
topics 
are 
included 
in 
the  in-service 
training 
initiative 
proposed 
by 
MED’s 
National 
Teacher 
Training 
Directorate (DINFOCAD). 
Teacher 
training 
schools 
and 
teacher 
training 
special projects 
will 
be 
restructured 
in 
order 
to 
meet 
future 
bilingual 
teachers’ 
needs, 
and 
to 
structure 
private 
and 
government 
initiatives 
so 
that 
both quality 
and 
better results 
are 
guaranteed. 
7.1 
IBE 
Teacher 
Training 
and 
Multiple 
Classrooms 
Schools 
As 
inter-cultural 
bilingual 
education 
becomes 
stronger and 
more 
widespread, 
in-service 
teacher 
training 
will 
become 
increasingly important, 
as 
part 
of 
the Continuous 
Teacher 
Training 
System that 
will 
give 
rural 
teachers 
ongoing opportunities 
to 
update 
and 
improve their 
professional 
skills 
and 
performance. 
The 
system 
will 
aim 
at 
ensuring 
the appropriate educational human 
resources’ 
development 
as 
part 
of 
a 
coherent 
and 
uninterrupted 
training 
scheme 
to 
improve 
the 
quality 
and performance 
of 
teacher 
classwork 
and 
student 
learning.  Likewise, 
and 
taking 
into 
account 
that  the 
teacher 
profession 
goes 
beyond 
classroom 
walls, 
the 
following 
aspects 
will 
be 
taken 
into 
account: 
0 
0 
0 
0 
Teachers 
as 
researchers. 
0 
Teachers 
as 
professional 
experts. 
The 
teacher 
as 
a 
learning mediator. 
Teachers 
as 
promoters 
of 
interaction 
between 
student 
learning 
and 
rural 
communities. 
Teachers 
as 
part 
and backbone 
of 
the 
local, 
regional 
and 
national 
education 
system. 
IBE 
teacher 
training 
in 
this 
initial 
stage 
will 
continue 
to 
enforce the 
principles 
of 
decentralization, 
timing 
and 
continuity, 
teacher 
counseling 
and 
monitoring, 
and 
the 
notion 
of 
“learning 
by 
doing”, 
while 
underscoring 
relevance 
and 
sustainability. 
In 
coordination 
with 
DINFOCAD, 
this 
initiative 
will 
strengthen 
bilingual 
teacher 
training 
in 
areas 
identified 
by

CURRICULUM 
DEVELOPMENT 
In 
coordination 
with 
the 
Initial 
and 
Primary 
Education 
National 
Directorate 
(DINEIE') 
and 
the 
Secondary 
and 
Vocational  Education  Directorate 
(DINESST), 
a 
curriculum 
proposal 
will 
be 
prepared 
and 
introduced 
that 
is 
related 
to 
the 
needs 
and 
demands 
identified 
among 
bilingual 
peoples. 
Likewise, further 
progress 
will 
be 
made 
in 
introducing 
an 
inter-cultural, 
bilingual 
and 
self-paced 
study 
program. 
As 
a 
complement, a 
contribution 
will 
be 
made 
to 
introduce 
further inter-cultural 
approaches and 
concepts 
in 
study programs 
at 
all 
levels 
and 
to 
promote the 
additional 
Spanish-native 
language 
bilingual 
learning 
approach 
so 
as 
to 
apply 
it 
through 
the 
whole  educational 
system 
and 
thus 
promote  dialogue 
and 
inter-cultural 
understanding 
across 
the 
nation. 
The 
development 
of 
Regional  and 
local 
guidelines 
will 
be promoted 
for 
the 
diversification 
of 
the 
curriculum 
from 
an 
inter-cultural viewpoint 
involving 
regional 
and 
sub-regional offices. 
To 
improve 
bilingual 
teacher 
classwork, a 
series 
of 
methodological 
strategies 
will 
be developed 
for 
each 
of 
the 
curriculum 
areas, 
with 
an 
emphasis 
on 
multigrade 
classrooms and 
for 
specific social and 
linguistic 
scenarios. 
The appropriate methodology 
handbooks 
will 
also 
be 
prepared. 
In 
order 
to 
adapt 
various 
inter-cultural 
bilingual 
learning 
to 
national 
bilingual 
contexts 
in 
Peru, 
a 
number 
of 
strategies 
will 
be developed 
for 
treating 
and 
using 
various 
languages 
in 
classroom situations, 
based 
on 
the 
cumulative 
experience 
gained 
to 
date 
in 
Peru 
and 
abroad.

RESEARCH 
Research 
on 
the 
languages 
and 
cultures 
of 
indigenous 
peoples 
will 
be promoted 
to

ADAPTING 
SCHOOL 
SCHEDULES 
TO 
PEASANT AND 
INDIGENOUS 
RURAL 
ECONOMICS 
AND 
FARM 
WORK 
Rural 
Peru 
is 
a 
peculiar 
and 
complex 
world 
due 
to 
its 
geographic, social, 
cultural, 
economic 
and 
political 
diversity. 
All 
these 
must 
be 
taken 
into 
account 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
access 
to 
and 
equal 
opportunity 
in 
education 
for rural 
boys 
and 
girls 
and 
provide them 
with 
quality 
education. 
A 
particularly important 
issue 
that 
needs 
to 
be 
taken 
into 
account 
in 
rural 
areas 
is 
the sewing-harvesting 
cycle. 
This 
cycle 
has 
a 
significant impact on 
student attendance 
during 
labor 
intensive 
periods. 
National 
Education 
regulations 
stipulate, 
that 
every 
school 
has 
the 
obligation to 
adopt 
to 
the 
local 
culture 
and 
environment. 
However 
schools have 
not 
implemented 
this 
mandate. 
This 
dissemination 
and 
promotion 
of 
this 
mandate 
will 
be carried out throughout 
the 
project 
areas. 
Additionally, 
from 
the 
viewpoint 
of 
curricular 
structure 
ad 
in 
coordination 
with 
DI", 
a 
self-paced 
approach 
to 
IBE 
will 
be 
implemented 
aimed 
at 
developing the 
students' 
potential. 
Rural children 
will 
gain 
access 
to 
a 
type 
of 
formal 
education 
that 
addresses 
their 
specific 
needs 
and 
contexts, 
that 
respects 
and 
assists 
in 
the 
development 
of 
their 
culture and 
language, 
and contributes 
to 
enhancing 
productive 
activities. 
As 
part 
of 
this 
model, 
grade 
promotion, 
as 
an 
indicator 
of 
the 
system's 
efficiency, 
will 
foster 
greater 
individual 
attention 
to 
monitor 
student 
achievement. 
To 
achieve 
this 
goal, 
the 
academic 
program 
will 
be 
organized 
as 
a 
chain 
of 
capacity 
building 
efforts 
centered 
on one 
area, 
and 
will 
be structured sequentially 
along six 
years 
of 
primary 
schooling 
and subsequently 
for 
high 
school 
education. 
Lastly, 
it 
is 
hereby proposed 
to diversify 
the 
school 
curriculum 
to 
include 
a 
number 
school calendar 
considerations and proposing 
backbone 
topics 
such 
as 
a 
multicultural 
approach, 
environmental education 
and 
production 
activities. 
12. 
CRITERIA 
FOR 
RECRUITMENT 
AND 
DEPLOYMENT 
OF 
IBE 
TEACHERS 
The 
teacher 
recruitment 
system 
must 
ensure 
that the appropriate 
teachers are 
hired 
and 
retained 
in 
order 
to 
provide quality 
and 
fair 
education. 
To 
do 
so, 
a 
periodical 
system 
for 
objective 
evaluation 
of 
teacher 
performance 
must 
be 
put 
in 
place 
so 
that:

best

sector.

is

Officials 
in 
charge 
of 
each 
school 
or network 
anywhere 
in 
Peru 
can 
make 
effective 
decisions 
to 
hire 
the 
teachers 
they 
need. 
Level 
The 
teacher 
screening 
and 
hiring 
strategy 
is 
comprised 
in 
a 
proposal 
to 
structure 
and 
develop the teaching 
career 
as 
part 
of 
the 
Rural 
Education 
Program. 
Basically, 
it 
proposes a 
new 
hiring 
system 
that 
reflects 
the 
government’s 
right 
to 
hire 
the 
best 
teachers 
and 
simultaneously gives 
teachers 
the 
right 
to 
job 
tenure 
on 
a merit-basis 
and 
subjected 
to 
performance 
evaluations. 
Additionally, 
in 
the 
long 
term, 
network 
councils 
in 
rural 
areas 
will 
be 
directly 
responsible 
for 
assigning teaching positions, 
and 
screening and 
hiring 
teachers. 
Number 
of 
Teachers 
While 
this 
new 
system 
is 
put 
in 
place, 
a 
few 
decisions 
have been 
made 
concerning 
IBE 
teachers. 
Directive 
No. 
002-2002-ED 
sets 
the 
hiring 
and  deployment 
criteria 
for 
teachers  and 
establishes 
competitive 
hiring 
through 
special 
evaluation committees 
for 
specific 
single-teacher, 
multigrade 
and 
bilingual 
IBE 
schools. 
1 
Secondary 
This 
guideline 
creates 
a special 
evaluation committee 
including 
“one 
representative 
of 
the respective 
indigenous 
group 
having 
signed 
an 
agreement 
with 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education, 
or 
from 
peasant 
or 
native 
communities, 
as 
applicable.. 
. 
” 
(Paragraph 
4.4). 
2,650 
107 
It 
also considers 
specific 
criteria 
for 
IBE 
schools 
recruitment, 
such 
as: 
“Teachers applying 
for 
a position 
at 
a 
given school 
must 
be 
fluent 
in 
the 
local 
native language where the 
school 
is 
located 
(article 
5 
of 
the 
regulation) 
and 
in 
Spanish. 
Additional credit 
will 
be 
given 
for 
holding 
a 
professional degree 
in bilingual 
education, and 
for 
mastery 
of 
the 
written 
vernacular 
language. 
’’ 
In 
general, 
the 
teacher 
screening strategy 
goes 
beyond technical and 
legal 
changes, 
and 
requires 
a sound 
political 
consensus 
to 
create 
a 
new social contract 
for 
education 
in 
which 
all 
stakeholders 
are 
brought 
together 
and 
are 
accountable 
for 
their 
actions 
and 
for 
the 
quality 
of 
their 
performance 
with 
respect 
to 
improving 
performance 
of 
boys 
and 
girls 
in 
Peru.
