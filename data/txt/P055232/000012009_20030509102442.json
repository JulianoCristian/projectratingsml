The project components are as follows. The first\n            component will increase access to, and quality of initial,\n            pre-school, and secondary education for children in rural\n            areas. Initial, and pre-school education will have a\n            non-formal approach to education, focused not only on\n            children, but on parents and siblings within a family, and\n            community framework. Trained community educators, fluent in\n            the local languages will provide initial education, and,\n            interventions combining formal, and non-formal approaches\n            will follow for pre-school, which includes the introduction\n            to the Spanish language. Distance secondary education will\n            be developed (in addition to traditional school delivery)\n            through cost-effective information and communication\n            technologies, and teacher training assistance. The second\n            component focuses on the quality of teaching, and learning\n            in primary schools in the targeted rural areas, supporting\n            continuous professional development focused on rural\n            teachers, developing, and distributing multi-grade, and\n            bilingual instruction materials, and, rehabilitating\n            classrooms. The third component will support the reform of\n            teacher policy, and education management, motivating\n            linkages towards educational standards, by supporting\n            schools development, within the national assessment system,\n            through strategic analysis and policy research."}, "docdt": "2003-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
