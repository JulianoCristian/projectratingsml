The\n            project would include: (i) a three year road maintenance\n            program including the procurement of road maintenance and\n            workshop equipment and the construction and related\n            supervision of buildings for maintenance depots, mechanical\n            workshops, warehouses and regional maintenance offices; (ii)\n            construction of vehicle weight control stations and\n            asphaltic concrete overlay with related supervision along\n            with detailed engineering for overlays of priority sections\n            of existing roads; (iii) preparation of a highway master\n            plan; (iv) technical assistance to the HA to fill key\n            on-line positions by direct recruitment of expatriates; and\n            (v) a three year HA training program including the provision\n            of training buildings, equipment, training staff and fellowships."}, "docdt": "1978-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
