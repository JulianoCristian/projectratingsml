               PUBLIC SECTORREFORMAND GROWTH GRANT

                    GRANT AND PROGRAM SUMMARY

Recipient:          Government o f The Gambia

ImplementingAgency: The Department o f State for Finance and Economic Affairs will be
                    responsible for the overall implementation o f the proposed operation,
                    in close cooperation with the National Planning Commission and
                    other Departments o f State.

FinancingData:      IDA Grant

OperationType:      This Development Policy Operation consist o f a single tranche o f
                    SDR 4.5 million (US$7 million equivalent) to be disbursed upon
                    grant effectiveness.

Main PolicyAreas:   The proposed operation focuses on continuing and deepening policy
                    reforms to improve public financial management, civil service
                    capacity and groundnut sector performance.

Key Outcome         (i) thenumberofmonthsrequiredto submittheprevious
                       Reduce
Indicators:         year's government accounts, from greater than one year in2007 to 6
                    months or less in 2009; (ii)reduce the backlog o f submission o f
                    audited accounts to the National Assembly, from 7 years in2007 to 2
                    years in 2009; and (iii)    officially announce the producer price for
                    groundnuts and the opening date for the groundnut marketing season
                    byNovember 15 in2009, compared to mid-December in2007.
ProgramDevelopment The main development objectives o f the proposed Grant are to
Objectivesand       strengthen the government's capacity to use public resources and
Contributionto CAS: improve the management o f the groundnut sector. The proposed
                    operation would achieve these development objectives by further
                    strengthening public financial management and initiating reforms o f
                    the civil service and the groundnut sector. Groundnuts are the
                    country's most important export and groundnut farmers are among
                    the poorest inthe country.

                    The proposed operation and the underlying reforms are an integral
                    part o f the country's second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
                    (PRSP) covering CYO7-11 and IDA'S Joint Assistance Strategy
                    (JAS) with AfDB for FY08-11. Inlight o f the government's funding
                    constraints and the likely impact o f the global economic slowdown,
                    the proposed operation will provide much needed resources for the
                    implementation o f the PRSP.

Risks:              The mainrisks associated with the proposedoperation are: (i)   limited
                    institutional capacity o f the government to pursue the reform agenda;
                    (ii)macroeconomic slippages and inadequate adjustments to


                                         vi

               exogenous shocks, most notably the global economic slowdown; (iii)
               weak governance; and (iv) difficulty of sustaining reforms in the
               groundnut sector.

               The risks associated with low institutional capacity are mitigated
               by a reform agenda which i s streamlined and selective, in line with
               the capacity constraints o f the government. Most o f the reform
               measures supported by the operation are ongoing activities. In
               addition, the government will continue to receive support for
               capacity building through various donor projects, including from
               IDA, AfDB, EC, DFIDandUNDP.

               With respect to macroeconomic risks, the government has so far
               carried out prudent measures in response to recent international
               developments and continues to maintain a dialogue with the
               development partners on appropriate policy responses and the
               possible need for augmented concessional external aid inthe form o f
               grants. Furthermore, macroeconomic risks would be mitigated by
               close monitoring and coordination by IDA, IMF and other donors.
               The need for external borrowing would be reduced by increased
               grant resources provided through the proposed operation and also
               through the recently approved Enhanced HIPC and MDRI debt
               relief.

               The country's weak governance could be further strengthened by
               enhancing the transparency and accountability o f the public sector.
               In order to mitigate the governance risk, wide consultations and
               participation o f both public and private stakeholders in the Policy
               Matrix reforms have been used to build country ownership. The
               support and participation o f donors in the implementation o f the
               Policy Matrix, particularly through frank and open policy dialogue,
               contribute towards buildingpolitical commitment to reforms. Donors
               have been providing capacity building support to the National Audit
               Office (Auditor General) and the National Assembly.
               Difficulties in sustaining reforms in the groundnut sector would
               be mitigated by extensive consultations with both public and private
               stakeholders in order to ensure country ownership, alignment o f
               reform measures with the government's          sector strategy and
               additional complementary investment support provided by IDA and
               the EC.

1.1.     This programdocumentproposes a single-tranche Public Sector Reform and Growth Grant
("Grant")   to the Republic o f The Gambia in the amount o f SDR 4.5 million (US$7 million
equivalent). The proposed Grant is a Development Policy Operation (DPO) which supports the
implementation of the country's second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).' The main
development objectives o f the proposed Grant are to strengthen the government's capacity to use
public resources and improve the management o f the groundnut sector, the country's most
important export. Commensurate with the government's limited institutional capacity, the
operation selectively covers a small set o f critical reform measures inthree key areas o f the PRSP:
(i) financialmanagement andstatistics; (ii) servicereforms; and(iii)
    public                                                  civil                               restructuring o f
the groundnut sector. These measures are critical components of PRSP pillars one (macroeconomic
stability and public sector reform) and two (promotion o f pro-poor growth and employment
through private sector development).

1.2.     The government has prepared a Joint General Budget Support Policy Matrix ("Policy
Matrix") which sequentially outlines priority PRSP reform measures and quantitative outcome
indicators in 2008-10 for the above three reform areas (see Annex 2). The Policy Matrix was
developed through extensive consultations with key public and private stakeholders and draws
from a wide range o f analytical work. IDA has been working closely with the government and
other development partners to identify the appropriate reform measures, through investment
projects and analytical exercises. The reform measures for the groundnut sector are an extension o f
the policy dialogue conducted for the HIPC completion point o f December 2007.2 The proposed
Grant complements support provided by IDA, AfDB, DFID and EC investment projects.

1.3.     The proposed IDA Grant supports the implementation o f a subset o f reforms in the
government's Policy Matrix in 2008 and 2009 (see Annex 3). These reform measures are also the
prior actions for the disbursement of IDA'Ssingle tranche. The AfDB and the EC are preparing
similar budget support operations to support the implementation o f the Policy Matrix in2009 and
2010. Although a single-tranche operation, the proposed Grant i s essentially programmatic across
institutions through the coordination and sharing o f a common Policy Matrix with AfDB and the
EC. IDA i s expected to disburse its proposed Grant towards early-CY09 and the AfDB towards the
second half CYO9. The EC plans to disburse in2010 but then intendsto continue providing budget
support up to CY12. The government and the participating development partners are expected to
sign a Memorandum o f Understanding (MOU) to formalize the coordination arrangement. The


  ' The PRSP and the accompanyingJoint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) was discussed by the World Bank Board of
  ExecutiveDirectors on July 19, 2007. This i s the country's second PRSP. The country recently draftedthe Annual
  ProgressReport(APR) for 2007.
    See report no. 41413-GM (HIPC completionpoint document) andthe corrigenda(IDAiR2007-0279/1 and41413-

exact timing o f disbursements from the development partners will depend on the progress the
government makes inachieving the Policy Matrix reform measures.

1.4.    There are several reasons for the proposed coordination arrangement. Despite being a
single tranche, it allows the Bank to support critical PRSP reforms which can only be implemented
over the medium term and extends the Bank's engagement inthe policy dialogue beyond the first
year o f implementation. It also improves donor coordination, reduces the government's transaction
costs and allows IDA to leverage its limited resources across a range o f critical policy reforms. The
proposed arrangement i s consistent with and endorsed in the Bank's FY08-11 Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) preparedjointly with the AfDB.3It i s in line with the aid effectiveness agenda o f
the development community.

                                          2. COUNTRY CONTEXT

2.1.    The Gambia is a small West African country with an average per capita GDP o f US$320
(Atlas method, 2007) and a ranking o f 155 out o f 177 countries in the 2007 UN Human
Development Index. The overall poverty headcount ratio i s 58 percent, with large socioeconomic
and regional variation^.^ The economy i s relatively undiversified and limited by a small internal
market. Services account for over half o f GDP, reflecting the importance o f external trade and
tourism. Liberal trade policies and an efficient port infrastructure have allowed the country to act
as a regional re-export hub. Tourism is a key driver o f the economy and the country's most
significant foreign exchange earner. Agriculture accounts for approximately a third o f GDP and
more than 70 percent o f employment. Groundnuts are the most important agricultural crop. They
account for approximately 60 percent o f domestic exports and 70 percent o f rural households
engage in groundnut production. However, groundnut farmers are among the poorest in the
country and the performance o f the sector has beenpoor inrecent years.

2.2.    There have been important gains in education and health indicators. Access to education
has expanded, particularly in rural areas, with a gross enrollment rate o f 77 percent which
increases to more than 90 percent if Madrassas enrollments are included. The next challenge is to
improve the quality o f education. The overall life expectancy inthe country, estimated at 57 years
(2005), is higher than the Sub-Saharan (SSA) average. The Gambia has also performed relatively
well on child health indicators compared to the SSA average, although both the infant mortality
and the under five mortality rates remain higher than those in Ghana and Senegal, two o f the best
performers o f West Africa. The Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) i s 540 per 100,000 live births
(2000), which is comparable to similar SSA countries.

2.3.    Governance. While the country has enjoyed relatively strong economic performance in
recent years, its political system i s characterized by a weak opposition and media. President
Jammeh has remained in power through a series o f elections since a military coup in 1994,
including the latest election in 2006 which international observers described as fair. The National
Assembly i s almost entirely composed o f members o f the President's party, the Alliance for

Patriotic Reorientation and Construction (APRC). As result, legislative opposition to the executive
office is relatively weak.

2.4.     According to cross-country aggregated governance indicators developed by World Bank
 researcher^,^     The Gambia ranks better than the SSA average on political stability, regulatory
quality and rule o f law but lower than the average on government effectiveness, voice and
accountability and control of corruption. Government effectiveness measures the quality o f public
services, policy formulation and implementation, and the capacity o f the civil service. Voice and
accountability measure the extent to which the country's citizens are able to participate inselecting
their government, and the freedom of expression, association and a free media. Corruption
measures the extent to which ublic power i s exercised for private gain and "capture" o f the state
                                    ?
by elites andprivate interests.

2.5.     The World Bank's Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) concludes that the
country's governance would benefit from strengthening, particularly with respect to accountability
o f the government and access to information on public affairs. International observers, including
Reporters without Borders, the International Bar Association and Amnesty International, have
cited the country's shortcomings in governance. The Gambia i s ranked 121 among 163 countries
by Transparency International. Strengthened governance could enhance the transparency and
accountability o f the public sector and reduce the risk o f policy slippages through greater country
ownership.

                                      RECENT      ECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS

2.6.     The country has enjoyed steady growth and a stable macroeconomic environment in recent
years. Real GDP growth has averaged 6.2 percent since 2003 after a brief contraction in 2002 due
to low rainfalls and poor macroeconomic management. Growth has been driven by tourism,
construction and telecommunication, and supported by substantial foreign direct investments
which have averaged 12.6 percent o f GDP since 2003. Sustained fiscal and monetary discipline
has been accompanied by significant improvements o fpublic financial management.

2.7.     The average inflation rate declined from a high o f 17.0 percent in 2003 to 2.1 percent in
2006. Fiscal discipline, characterized by reduced government domestic borrowing, provided the
basis for a significant slowdown o f broad money growth. However, rising costs o f food and oil
imports pushed the annual rate o f inflation to 5.4 percent in 2007. Inflationary pressures were
contained by a tight monetary policy and the significant appreciation o f the local currency due to
strong inflow o f remittances and reduced debt service payments.

2.8.     Ingeneral, the macroeconomic impact of international price increases has beenrelatively
modest, although the impact on the poor could have'been significant. The government responded
to the food price increases by reducing the sales tax on rice imports from 15 percent to 5 percent in
July 2007 and eliminating it altogether inMay 2008.

  Governance Indicators 1996-2007," World Bank, Policy Research Working Paper, No. 4654, June 2008.
   The Kaufman, Kraay andMastruzzi indicators provide abroadbasis for cross-country comparisons but canbe a
  relatively blunt instrument for specific policy advice due to the sheer number and diversity o f indicators used, the
  complexity o f the aggregation methodology, and the fact that the number and sources o f data change over time.

2.9.     Fiscal policy has been largely consistent with macroeconomic stability. In the past four
years, the overall fiscal balance has averaged a deficit o f 4.5 percent o f GDP. It significantly
improved from a deficit o f 7.8 percent o f GDP in 2006 to a surplus o f 0.5 percent in 2007, mostly
due to reduced expenditures. The primarybalance surplus, a better measure o f discretionary fiscal
policy, increased significantly in 2004 and has averaged 7.5 percent the past four years. Domestic
revenue has averaged annually 20.2 percent o f GDP since 2004, a relatively strong performance.
External financing (loans and grants) has been large, averaging 9.5 percent o f GDP inthe past four
years, but it has declined from 12.6 percent in 2004 to 4.8 percent in 2007. However, HIPC and
MDRIreliefwill provide additional resources up to approximately 2.5 percent o f GDP per annum.
External resources have funded significant public investments in PRSP priority areas, including
education, health, agriculture, infrastructure and public sector capacity building.

2.10.    Sustained fiscal discipline has been necessary to bring the rapidlyincreasing domestic debt
under control. The stock o f domestic debt hit a peak o f 38.1 percent o f GDP in2001 partly due to
large off-budget expenditures, funded by Central Bank lending.' Domestic interest payments
increased from 3.4 percent of GDP in2001 to 6.8 percent o f GDP in2005, inthe process crowding
out other expenditures. With the reestablishment o f fiscal discipline and the curtailing o f domestic
financing, the domestic debt decreased to 28.1 percent o f GDP and domestic interest payments to
3.6 percent in 2007, reflecting reduced annual yields on treasury bills to approximately 6 to 7
percent inreal terms.




  7 The government has made major strides to prevent the reoccurrence o f such extrabudgetary expenditures,
  including major reforms o f public expenditure management (see section 5, section "pubic financial management"),
  and the strengthening o f the independence o f the Central Bank and the setting o f limits on its lending to the
  government (see paragraph 6.12). Such reforms allowed the IMF to reestablish the PRGF-supported program in
  2007.

  balance o f revenues and expenditures).

2.11. The external current account deficit (including official transfers) widened significantly
from 6.1 percent o f GDP in 2004 to 15.1 percent in 2005, mainly due to lower remittances and
official transfers and the collapse o f groundnut exports, the country's main export.8 Groundnut
exports collapsed as a result of failures in internal marketing arrangements. Changes in the
government licensing system awarded a monopoly license to an inexperienced new operator while
leaving out the established operators. Problems were compounded by the breakdown of the barges
which are used to transport the crops. The partial recovery o f groundnut exports as well as strong
tourism growth contributed to the narrowing o f the current account deficit in 2006 and 2007.
Tourist arrivals rose by more than 20 percent in2005 and reached record levels in2007/8.

2.12.   The improvements in macroeconomic management were buttressed by a number o f
significant reforms on public financial management and Central Bank operations. These reforms
have improved transparency and accountability in the use of public resources and reduced the
opportunities for corruption. They included: (i)updating the legislative framework for public
expenditure management, revenue administration and public procurement; (ii)establishing a
national Gambia Revenue Authority (GRA); (iii)               developing an Integrated Financial Management
Information System (IFMIS); (iv) reducing the backlog of government accounts; (v) strengthening

  8Note also that the BOP data were revised from 2005 and this could explainpart o f the deterioration from 2004 to
  2005 onwards.

the independence and internal controls o f the Central Bank; and (vi) establishing the Gambia
Public ProcurementAuthority (GPPA).

2.13,   Macroeconomic policy improvements resulted inthe IMFreengaging the country through a
new PRGF-supportedprogram. The previous program covering 2002-05 went off-track due to off-
budget expenditures and mismanagement o f Central Bank foreign exchange transactions. After
satisfactory corrective measures were taken, the Fund reengaged through a Staff-Monitored
Program (SMP) in 2005-06. The successful implementation o f the SMP was followed by a new
PRGF-supported program in February 2007. The fourth review o f the program was successfully
completed inFebruary2009. The improvements inpolicy implementation also allowed the Boards
o f the Bank and the Fund to approve the HIPC completion point in December 2007. The Paris
Club bilateral creditors agreed in January 2008 to provide debt relief according to their
commitment to the enhanced HIPC initiative.

                                      MACROECONOMIC     OUTLOOK

2.14.   The overall medium term outlook is expected to be negatively impacted by the ongoing
global economic slowdown (see Table 1). Growth in 2008 is estimated to have been relatively
robust at 5.9 percent partly due to a significant rebound in crop production which benefited from
good rainfall. The impact o f higher international prices in the first half o f the year was relatively
subdued, in part due to the dalasi appreciation. The current account deficit (including official
transfers) i s estimated to have significantly widened to 16 percent o f GDP in 2008 due to lower
remittances and tourism earnings and higher oil and food imports. Gross official reserves are
projectedto decline from 5.5 months o f imports in2007 to 3.9 months in2008.

2.15.   The government has maintained prudent fiscal policies in2008, particularly with respect to
ensuring fiscal and debt sustainability. Domestic revenue is estimated to have declined from 21.4
percent o f GDP in2007 to 18.6 percent in2008 due to a decline in international trade taxes driven
by: (i) slowdown in activities in sectors such as construction which has resulted in lower imports;
(ii) exchangerateappreciationwhichhasreducedthevalueofimportsinthelocalcurrency;
     recent
(iii)reducedre-export trade; (iv) suspension of the sales tax on rice imports; and (v) slow
adjustment o f the retail price o fpetroleumproducts when international prices were increasing.

2.16.   The government's current expenditures are estimated to have been 16.5 percent o f GDP in
2008, roughly in line with recent past. As a result, the basic primary balance i s estimated to have
declined from 8.8 percent o f GDP in 2007 to 4.2 percent in 2008. The wage bill has largely been
frozen in 2009 and i s projected to roughly remain at this level for the near future. Government
interest payments declined from 5.0 percent o f GDP in 2007 to 4.0 percent in 2008 due to lower
domestic borrowing and the H P C and MDRIdebt relief, which reduced the stock o f external debt
from 133.6 percent o f GDP in 2006 to 46.0 percent in 2007. Capital (development) expenditures,
largely dependent on external funding, were estimated to have declined from 6.5 percent of GDP
in2007 to 4.7 percent in2008.

2.17.   The recent sale o f 50 percent o f government shares in the Gambia Telecommunications
Company (GAMTEL) provides additional fiscal financing. The sale took place in the second half
o f 2007 for US$35 million, or approximately 4.4 percent o f 2008 GDP. The proceeds will be spent
over 2007-9. Approximately half o f the proceeds are earmarked for spending on military and



                                                  - 6 -

security infrastructure. The government has indicated that these one-time investments are
necessary to maintain security and stability o f the country, particularly given potential disturbances
across the borders in the Senegalese region o f Cassamance. Also, the remainder o f the
privatization proceeds is expected to be usedto finance education and health projects, construction
and renovation o f government facilities, the establishment o f a science academy and possibly to
reduce the domestic debt. The use o f the funds has been transparently incorporated into the
government's budget.

2.18.   The impact o f the global economic slowdown on the country's growth is expected to result
inreal GDP declining from 5.9 percent in 2008 to 4.6 percent in 2009 and 5.0 percent in 2010.
Growth i s expected to decline largely due to: (i)fewer tourism arrivals and lower spending by
tourists; (ii) remittances, resulting in reduced construction activities; and (iii) continued
              lower                                                                        a
decline o f the re-export trade, which has historically been an important sector and a significant
contributor to government revenues. The expected decline intourism and remittances i s the direct
result o f the global economic slowdown and hence could be considered cyclical to some extent.
The expected downsizing o f the re-export trade i s at least partially due to structural factors.
Neighboring countries have lowered their taxation o f imports and improved their port facilities and
overall quality o f trade facilitation, thus underminingThe Gambia's traditional advantages as a re-
export hub.

2.19.   A few sectors are expected to continue growing for at least the short term. The
telecommunication sector will expand due to the expected entrance o f a new mobile telephone
operator, which would increase the total number o f operators to four. Four new commercial banks
are expected to enter the market. The growth projections for the agricultural sector have been kept
at the relatively modest rates o f the recent past, but current and planned donor support could
potentially improve the sector's performance in the short to medium term. Finally, international
prices o f groundnuts, the country's main export, have roughly doubled since 2006 and remain
historically high. It provides an opportunity for the country as long as the government i s able to
reform its dysfunctional groundnut sector.

2.20.   The Central Bank o f The Gambia (CBG) will continue to use money targeting to pursue
price stability. The CBG intends to intermittently intervene in the foreign exchange markets in
order to maintain foreign exchange reserve targets and correct for perceived exchange rate
misalignment or highmarket volatility. Inflation i s expected to be more pronounced at 6.4 percent
in 2009 due to a lagged pass-through o f the recent increases in import prices. Foreign direct
investment and official loans are expected to continue to be the main sources o f financing o f the
current account deficit, which i s projected to improve from -17.1 percent o f GDP in2008 to -15.6
percent in 2011. Gross official reserves, in terms o f months o f imports, are projected to remain
roughly at the levels o f 2008 for the near future.

2.21.   The government is committed to maintaining prudent fiscal policies. The decline in2008 o f
domestic revenue i s expected to partially recover in the short term and the decline is projected to
be largely compensated by increased official grants. Current expenditures are projected to increase
modestly while capital expenditures are expected to significantly increase from 4.7 percent o f GDP
in 2008 to 9.5 percent in 2009 and 10.8 percent in 2010, due to recently secured official
development assistance.




                                                   - 7 -

2.22.   The financial sector appears relatively solid and isolated from the global financial turmoil.
The financial sector consists mostly o f commercial banks. The banks are generally highly liquid
and profitable. The average risk weighted capital adequacy ratio was 24 percent in March 2008
and all banks are above the minimum 8 percent ratio as stipulated by the Financial Institutions Act
(2003) and the Base1Iaccord. Asset quality has generally been reasonable, helped by debt write-
offs and reduced interest rates. The proportion o f non-performing loans has remained relatively
stable at 12 to 14 percent, which i s approximately average in SSA, and recently fell to 10 percent
in March 2008. Banks' total foreign liabilities are relatively small, indicating that they do not
depend on foreign borrowing. The Central Bank should ensure that it has adequate capacity for
bank supervision given that the number o f banks has steadily increased in recent years. The Bank
and the Fundexpect to provide support to the government under the Bank and Fundjoint Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), inresponse to a recent government request.

2.23.   The macroeconomic policy framework provides an adequate basis for the proposed
operation. The government has generally demonstrated a satisfactory track record in maintaining
prudent macroeconomic policies that are sustainable over the medium term. The framework is
supported by an IMF PRGF program which has been on-track since the three-year arrangement
was approved in February 2007. The fourth review of the program is expected to be presented to
the Fund's Board inJanuary 2009.

2.24.   The main risks to the above framework are the impact o f a more extended global
slowdown, failure to maintain fiscal and monetary discipline and excessive borrowing. There are
significant risks resulting from the continued weakening o f the global economy and its potential
impact on The Gambia, particularly through further declines o f government revenues and widening
of the current account deficit. Although the macroeconomic framework i s up-to-date based on the
fourth review o f the PRGF-supported program, including the estimated possible impact o f the
global economic downturn on tourism, remittances, foreign investments and the re-export trade,
the projections are still uncertain and tentative and will need to be closely monitored for continuing
developments. The government has been discussing with the development partners on appropriate
policy responses to the global downturn and the possible need for augmented concessional external
aid. Maintaining fiscal discipline will be critical in light o f the expected reduction in domestic
revenue. Prudent debt management will be needed to keep the public debt on a sustainable path
after debt relief.

                                         DEBTSUSTAINABILITY

2.25.   InDecember 2007, The Gambia reached its completion point under the Enhanced HIPC
Initiative. As a result o f achieving the completion point, the country will receive in total the
equivalent o f US$514 million in nominal debt relief under both the Enhanced HIPC Initiative and
the MDRI, on principal as well as interest payments over approximately the next 43 years. The
debt relief will provide the country with significant additional resources for implementing its
PRSP.

2.26.   While full delivery o f debt relief under the HIPC Initiative and the MDRI would
significantly reduce the external public debt, The Gambia will remain at a high risk o f debt
distress. The country's stock o f external debt will remain large post-completion point primarily
due to outstanding debt owed to multilateral creditors that do not participate in MDRI and non-



                                                   - 8 -

Paris Club bilateral creditors. A large share o f the debt was contracted since the decision point.
The latest Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA), based on the joint debt sustainability framework for
low-income countries, projects the NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio to be 138 percent in 2009 and to
remain above the country's policy-dependent threshold o f 100 percent for the foreseeable future.'
Inaddition, the sensitivity analysis shows that the country's external public debt indicators would
substantially worsen in the presence of adverse shocks. By contrast to the NPV o f debt-to-exports
ratio, the NPV o f external debt-to-GDP ratio and all debt service indicators are expected to fall
substantially and remain below their respective debt distress thresholds. The debt service indicators
indicate that debt servicing i s not expected to be a major problem.

2.27.    Taking adequate measures to reduce the risk o f debt distress will be critical. These
measures include continued fiscal prudence, policies to support broad-based growth and export
diversification, sustained donor support and improved debt management. Accordingly, under the
PRGF-supported program the government has set a minimumgrant element o f 45 percent for new
external borrowing and plans to limit the volume o f new borrowing to approximately US$30
million in2009.

2.28.    The Central Bank is responsible for domestic debt management while a dedicated unit
within Finance is responsible for external debt management. In general, domestic debt
administration appears to be adequate while external debt managementhas weaker capacity with
respect to debt recording, monitoring and analysis, although debt service arrears have not been an
issue. The government prepares an annual plan for financing as part o f its budget and plans on
extending this to a medium term financing plan as part o f a debt management strategy. The legal
framework for public borrowing i s clearly defined in the Government Budget Management and
Accountability Act (2004).

                       3. THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM:PRSP (2007-11)

3.1.     The Gambia's national development strategy is articulated in its second PRSP, which
covers the years 2007 to 2011.lo PRSP and the accompanying Joint Staff Advisory Note
                                         The
(JSAN) was discussed by the World Bank Board o f Executive Directors on July 19, 2007. The
PRSP is organized into five "pillars": (i)        macroeconomic stability and public sector reform; (ii)
promotion o f pro-poor growth and employment through private sector development; (iii)                  improved
basic social services; (iv) decentralization and strengthenedlocal governance; and (v) multisectoral
programs on gender, HIV/AIDS, environment, nutrition, and population. The PRSP initiatives
were chosen based on their contribution towards the achievement o f the MilleniumDevelopment
Goals (MDGs). The proposed Grant will support policy actions inpillars one and two o f the PRSP.

3.2.     The PRSP includes a detailed action plan with estimated costs. The financing gap is
definedas the total cost o f activities identified inthe action plan, minus projected government and
donor contributions and savings from HIPC/MDRI debt relief. The annual indicative funding gap
i s quite large at US$ 62 million, or roughly 7 percent o f average GDP. The JSAN emphasizes that




   9The latest joint LIC D S A was submitted to the Boards of the Executive Directors o f the Bank and the Fund in
   February 2009.
   10The first PRSP covered the years 2002 to 2005 and was presented to the Boards o f IDA and the IMF inJuly 2002.


                                                        - 9 -

further prioritization and streamlining of PRSP activities would beneededgiven the large funding
gap and also the limitedabsorptive capacity o f the government.

3.3.    The 2007 PRSP Annual Progress Report (APR) is the country's most recent APR, finalized
in October 2007 and submitted to the Boards of the Bank and the Fundin January 2009 together
with the Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN). The APR indicates that macroeconomic performance
was relatively strong and improvements were made inpublic financial management and the social
sectors, but progress was slower for the agricultural sector and decentralization. In order to
improve the implementation o f the PRSP, the JSAN recommended that the government develop a
comprehensive agricultural sector strategy, prioritize the improvement of governance, inparticular
economic governance, and refine PRSP performance indicators.

3.4.    The PRSP was developed through a participatory and consultative process. Stakeholder
consultative workshops and focus group discussions were held with representatives o f the public
and private sectors and civil society. Consultations reached down to the level o f local
communities. Participatory Poverty Assessments, Community Scorecards, and "budget games"
were incorporated into the preparatory process. Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) directly
participated inthe drafting o f the PRSP document.

3.5.    The National Planning Commission (NPC) coordinates the preparation and implementation
of the PRSP. NPC works closely with multi-stakeholders, inparticular the recently established Aid
Coordination Unit within the Department of State for Finance and Economic Affairs (DOSFEA).
NPC also i s responsible for informing internal and external partners o f progress in implementing
the PRSP. It will be one o f the main institutions coordinating the implementation o f the Policy
Matrix.

                                           PRSPPILLARS

3.6.    In pillar one. on macroeconomic stability and public sector reform, the major
macroeconomic objectives are to: (i)consolidate the recent gains in macroeconomic stability; (ii)
reduce the domestic debt down to a sustainable path; and (iii)spend at least 30 percent of the
locally funded government budget on PRSP programs. A key priority i s to maintain fiscal
discipline in order to reduce the domestic debt, which has become more challenging due to the
unfavorable external developments. Reducing the domestic debt i s expected to lower domestic
interest rates and allow increased lendingto the private sector.

3.7.    Public sector reforms are highlighted in pillar one. They include: (i)developing the
Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS); (ii)reducing the backlog in
preparing and auditing o f government accounts; (iii)   strengtheningthe GambiaRevenue Authority
(GRA) and reducing discretionary approval o f duty exemptions; (iv) improving official statistics
through continued reforms of the Gambia Bureau of Statistics (GBOS); and (v) implementing a
civil service reformprogram.

3.8.    Pillar two on promotion of pro-Door growth and emplovment emphasizes promoting private
sector development in the key sectors of agriculture, tourism, fisheries, trade and industry. The
government will focus on expanding infrastructure and energy, particularly roads and electricity,
and strengthening regulatory oversight, including the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority



                                                 - 1 0 -

(PURA). The judicial system will be reformed and the government's divestiture program will
continue to be implemented.

3.9.    Agricultural policies aim to promote export diversification and ensure food security by
strengthening research and extension services, adequately funding the recurrent budget and
integrating water resource management. Private sector participation will be encouraged in the
supply o f inputs, including fertilizers, seeds and credit. Interventions will focus on groundnuts,
horticulture and livestocks. The policies o f the tourism sector will focus on increasing overseas
marketing campaigns and diversifying and upgrading tourism products, including eco-tourism.
Major objectives o f the fisheries sector are to expand infrastructure facilities for storage and
processing, manage fishery resources in a sustainable manner and promote Gambian participation
in the sector. In addition to expanding infrastructure and energy, the government's trade and
industrial policies include reducing administrative barriers, streamlining the multiplicity o f taxes at
the central and local government levels, improving access and costs o f air transportation, and
expanding regional trade integration.

3.10.   Pillar three on improving basic social services focus on improving the delivery o f
education, health, water and sanitation services. The major challenges in education are improving
the quality o f education, recruiting and retaining qualified teachers and ensuring gender equality.
Priorities o f the health sector are staff training, effective human resource management, scaling up
community-based initiatives such as the Bamako Initiative and improving the availability o f drugs
inhealth facilities. Water and sanitation services will be improved through ongoing donor hnded
projects, promotion o f irrigation using groundwater and rainwater, and expanded coverage by the
National Water and Electricity Corporation (NAWEC).

3.11. Pillar four on decentralization and strengthening local governance outlines policies and
actions to implement the Local Government Act (2002) and the Local Government Finance and
Audit Act (2004). Major activities planned include establishing a local government service
scheme, decentralizing the planning process, mobilizing resources and building capacity o f local
governments.

3.12.   Under pillar five on multisectoral promams, gender equality will focus on improving
access to education and economic opportunities for women and protecting women's rights.
HIV/AIDS programs under the National HIV/AIDS Secretariat (NAS) emphasize education
awareness campaigns, including on the use o f condoms, and treatment, care and support o f
patients.   The priorities for environmental protection are strengthening the institutional and
regulatory framework and conducting advocacy and sensitization campaigns. The key challenges
for improved nutrition are to scale up interventions and strengthen partnerships with the private
sector, civil society and local communities. The implementation o f the National Population Policy
(2003) will be facilitated by integrating population issues into the national planning process and
strengthening the government's research capacity on population policy issues.

                                TO                                STRATEGY

4.1.     The IDA and the AfDB's Joint Assistance Strategy (JAS) for FY08-11 was discussed by
the Board o f IDA in February 2008. The JAS strategic objectives are aligned with the PRSP. The
overall approach o f the JAS emphasizes selectivity given limited IDA resources and takes account
o f the comparative advantage o f the IDA and the AfDB as well as other donors. It focuses on: (i)
strengthening economic management and public service delivery; and (ii)      enhancing productive
capacity and accelerating growth and competitiveness. There are two new major IDA operations
proposed inthe JAS, the proposed DPO (budget support) and a private sector development project
on growth and competitiveness. The JAS indicates that the AfDB also plans to prepare a budget
support grant, inclose coordination with IDA, and a project on livestock and horticulture.

4.2.     The budget support providedby IDA and the AfDB is central to the JAS, accounting for 36
percent of the JAS resource envelope. The JAS determined that The Gambia was ready to
transition to budget support, based on the following considerations o f the country's economic
policy and institutional environmentandits capacity to carry out its reform program:

      There i s a coherent country policy program, the PRSP, which benefits from a broad country
      ownership built through an extensive participatory and consultativepreparationprocess.

      There i s an adequate macroeconomic framework supported by an IMF PRGF program which
      i s currently on-track.

      The budget support i s consistent with the country's efforts to maintain debt sustainability
      giventhat it will beprovided as grants.

      The country's governance and institutional capacity was deemed adequate to sustain
      economic performance and implement the reform program. Inparticular, the government has
      made significant progress in strengtheningpublic financial management and the governance
      o f the Central Bank.

4.3.     The government has been expressing a strong preference for budget support given that it
improves predictability of funds and reduces donor transaction costs. Inthe past, this had not been
forthcoming from the donors mainly due to the absence of a track record with an IMF PRGF-
supported program. This has now been addressed with the successful implementation o f a PRGF
program since early 2007. Finally, the decision by three o f the major development partners, IDA,
AfDB and EC, to coordinate budget support also provides a significant opportunity to improve
donor coordination, minimize the burden on the government's limited capacity, and allows each
donor to be engaged ina range o f critical policy reforms despite limitedresources.

4.4.     The design o f the proposed operation is consistent with the JAS. The JAS indicates that
public financial management, official statistics, civil service reform and the groundnut sector
would be critical areas o f Bank assistance and that the proposed DPO would be the appropriate
instrument to support the government inthese areas.




                                                - 12-

4.5.    The JAS builds on the relative success o f IDA'Sengagements under the previous CAS.
Investments projects have included the Capacity Building for Economic Management Project
(CBEMP) which supported the strengthening o f public revenue and expenditure management, the
Trade Gateway Project for promoting private sector investments, projects on the Health and
Education sectors, a Community DrivenDevelopment (CDD) project and a project on HIV/AIDS.
IDA has also been actively collaborating with the government and other development partners on
major analytical exercises, including a series o f public expenditures reviews, an analysis o f civil
service capacity and performance, the Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), the
Country Procurement Issues Paper (CPIP), the Diagnostic Trade Integrated Study (DTIS), and the
ongoing Investment Climate Assessment and the Poverty Assessment.

                         COLLABORATION WITH THE IMFAND OTHER DONORS

4.6.    The staffs o f IDA and the IMF closely collaborate on The Gambia, particularly with respect
to the implementation o f the country's PRSP, by harmonizing support for policy reforms and
coordinating policy analysis and recommendations. IDA typically takes the lead on sectoral issues,
including public sector reform and the groundnut sector, while the IMF takes the lead on
macroeconomic policies. The two institutionsjointly prepared the JSAN on the new PRSP and the
HIPC completion point document, including the debt sustainability analysis. The IMF was closely
consulted on the Policy Matrix for the proposed DPO and the successful implementation o f the
PRGF-supported program will be critical to ensuring an adequate macroeconomic framework and
the sustainability o f the reforms inthe Policy Matrix.

4.7.    Budget support in The Gambia has been catalytic for donor harmonization around key
policy measures and results. All the donors participating inbudget support, the IDA, AfDB and the
EC, will coordinate their disbursements based upon the government's Policy Matrix, formalized
through a MOU. The government and the three donors plan on conducting annual joint reviews of
progress in implementing the Policy Matrix, which will allow for consensus-building and lower
the transaction costs for the government. All the prior actions for the proposed DPO are part o f the
joint Policy Matrix.

                              RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANKOPERATIONS

4.8.    The proposed development policy operation complements four investment projects, the
Education Phase 11, the Trade Gateway, CDD and the Africa Emergency Locust Project, and the
recently closed CBEMP. A new project on growth and competitiveness i s being prepared. The
DPO supports policy and institutional reforms o f the public sector and the groundnut sector. These
reforms complement the investments in goods and works, technical assistance and training
provided by the above mentioned investment projects, including the support recently provided by
the CBEMP on public financial reform and the Gateway project on the groundnut sector.

                                          LESSONSLEARNED

      Designprograms in line with limited local capacity. Inhindsight, the previous CAS was
      overly ambitious in its coverage. Planned interventions in rural development, energy and
      budget support were not launched. In acknowledgement o f capacity constraints, the DPO
      selectively limits its coverage to three reform areas.

      Target sectors with clear strategies.Reform progress was made in sectors which had clear
      sector strategies. The DPO focuses on sectors with either existing strategies or where there
      are ongoing reform initiatives based on solid analytical underpinnings.

      Provide close staff supervision. The DPO will be supervisedbyjoint assessment missions
      which will facilitate continued policy dialogue. Clearly defined and monitorable policy
      actions and indicators will facilitate supervision.

      ImprovePRSPimplementation.The implementation o fthe previous PRSP, covering 2005-
      07, was uneven. Inparticular, the shares o f PRSP related expenditures in the government's
      budget were lower than targeted. The joint general budget support matrix emphasizes the
      need to improve resource allocations for PRSP implementation and includes quantitative
      benchmarks on shares o f PRSP priority expenditures.

      Strengthenpublic sector economic managementand governance.Inthe past, governance
      failures in budget management and CBG operations had stalled the planned transition to
      budget support. However, there have been recent successes, particularly the improvement o f
      public expenditure management through IFMIS. The DPO heavily emphasizes support for
      reforms o f public financial management.12 Governance reform o f the CBG will continue to
      be supported bythe IMFthrough the PRGF-supportedprogram.

      Improve donor coordination. The DPO was prepared in close collaboration with the
      participating donors and non-participating donors were also consulted. The donors will also
      jointly monitor implementation o fthe joint general budget support matrix.


                                      ANALYTICALUNDERPINNINGS

4.10.   A number o f analytical and strategic studies provide the basis for the design o f the
proposed operation (see Table 3). IDA has actively collaborated with the government and the
development partners on many o f these analytical exercises and this active engagement i s expected
to continue beyond the disbursement of the proposed Grant's single tranche.

4.11.   The "Poverty Analysis o f the Integrated Household Survey" provides the basic poverty
profile o f the country using the 2003 household survey, the latest survey conducted. The overall
poverty headcount ratio i s 58 percent and there are significant geographical, gender and
occupational variations to poverty. In particular, poverty i s much higher among groundnut
producers compared to other households. This i s the main reason the government's Policy Matrix
prioritizes the revitalization o f the groundnut sector. An ongoing Poverty Assessment will provide
updated analysis which can be incorporated inthe joint assessment missions.


  12The DPO draws onthe findings ofthe ongoingCountryFinancialAccountabilityAssessment (FY09).


                                                  - 14-

4.12. There have been a series o f diagnostic assessments o f the country's public expenditure
management (PEM) capacity, including the ongoing Country Financial Accountability Assessment
(CFAA) beingprepared by IDA in collaboration with the government and assessments carried out
under the IDA investment project, CBEMP. These diagnostic assessments indicate that there have
been significant improvements inPEM capacity, particularly through the recently adopted IFMIS.
The key challenges are to continue with the ongoing reforms so that they become entrenched and
permanent, particularly regarding the timely preparation o f audited public accounts, fiscal reports
andbudgets consistent with PRSP priorities, and the adequate recurrent cost funding of IFMIS in
order to ensure its sustainability. The ongoing reforms would be complemented by improvements
in.budget preparation, aid coordination andinternal auditing. These reforms were incorporated in

establishment o f the national Gambia Revenue Authority (GRA) and the preparation o f its draft

medium term strategic plan. The consultancy reports analyzed strategic planning, operational
procedures, organizational design and governance, and human resource management. They
recommended that the medium term strategy should focus on transparency and accountability,
quality and timely customer service, simplified and standardized procedures and legislation,
efficient and effective IT systems, and adequate numbers o f qualified and motivated staffs. These
recommendations were the basis for GRA's medium term strategic plan, which in turn i s the
central focus for the revenue reforms inthe Policy Matrix.

4.14.   The shortcomings o f the government statistical system are well documented in a series o f
diagnostic reports. The steady and drastic decline inthe standards o f performance was mainly due
to a significant decline in funding and staffing and limited accountability for data production,
archiving and dissemination. The reports highlighted a range o f reforms needed to strengthen local
capacity and improve the quality and timeliness o f official statistics and ensure their political
neutrality. Based on the recommendations o f the analytical reports, the government transformed
the existing statistics agency into the semiautonomous Gambia Bureau o f Statistics (GBOS) and
prepared an institutional restructuring plan for official statistics. This restructuring plan i s the basis
for the reformmeasures o f official statistics supported inthe Policy Matrix.

4.15.   Based on the recommendations o f the 1998 Country Procurement Assessment Report
(CPAR), the government had embarked on a series o f reforms embodied in the Gambia Public
Procurement Act (2001) and the Gambia Public Procurement Authority (GPPA), established in
2002. The Country Procurement Issues Paper (CPIP) prepared in 2005 assessed the new public
procurement system o f the country. The CPIP recommendedthat GPPA should not carry out both
the regulatory and operational control functions, procedures and documentation should be further
streamlined and simplified, and the thresholds for prior review should be reviewed as they appear
to be too low. The CPIP recommendations form the basis for the procurement reforms supported in
the Policy Matrix.

4.16.   The key constraints o f the public sector and the civil service were extensively analyzed in
the recently prepared reports "The Gambia Improving Civil Service Performance" and "The
Gambia Public Service Pensions Policy Reform Note." These reports were jointly prepared by the
government, IDA, AfDB and DFID. The major findings were that technical and managerial
capacity precipitously deteriorated in recent years due to the loss o f upper grade staffs,
compensation i s low even compared to low income African countries, human resource planning i s
weak and incremental, promotions are based mostly on seniority, and performance appraisal and
results oriented management do not exist. Based on the findings o f the reports, the government has
developed a civil service reform strategy. The Policy Matrix supports the finalization and
implementation o f this strategy and key reform measures highlightedinthe strategy.

4.17.   The groundnut sector has been plagued by policy inconsistencies and reversals,
culminating in the virtual collapse o f exports in 2005. Various documents analyzed the structural
deficiencies o f the groundnut sector, including a Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) by the
IMF. These documents highlight problems associated with underinvestments in processing and
infrastructural assets, reliance on credit purchases and delays in groundnut procurement by the
formal sector, deteriorating quality o f groundnuts, an inefficient producer price determination
mechanism, and government interventions in import and distribution o f farm inputs. Based on
these analyses, the government developed a sector reform Roadmap in2007 which outlines actions


                                                  - 16-

to revitalize the sector by allowing free entry o f operators, transferring management o f the sector
to an association o f public and private stakeholders, and divestiture o f the government owned
groundnut processing plants. The implementation o f the Roadmap and its priority reform measures
are reflectedinthe government's Policy Matrix.

                                  5. THE PROPOSEDOPERATION

                                      OPERATIONDESCRIPTION

5.1.    The proposed Grant o f SDR 4.5 million (US$7 million equivalent) is a one-tranche
Development Policy Operation which supports the implementation o f the government's Policy
Matrix. The Policy Matrix outlines the government's priority reform measures and benchmark
indicators for 2008-10 (see Annex 2). It i s derived from the country's PRSP, which covers 2007-
11. The proposed operation supports a subset o f Policy Matrix reforms in 2008. The reform
measures supported by the proposed operation are also the prior actions for the disbursement o f the
Grant (see Annex 3 and Table 4). IDA'Sprior actions are also highlighted in bold in the Policy
Matrix. The Grant's support will be coordinated with similar support being prepared by the AfDB
and the EC, who are expected to support the implementation o f the Policy Matrix in2009-10. The
proposed Grant i s approximately equal to 0.8 percent o f projected GDP and 4.8 percent o f
projected government recurrent expenditures in2009.

5.2.    The main development objectives o f the proposed Grant are to strengthen the government's
capacity to use public resources and improve the management o f the groundnut sector. The
proposed operation would achieve these development by supporting prior actions in the following
three major PRSP priority policy areas:

      Improving public resource management through reforms o f revenue administration, budget
      execution, monitoring and auditing, and official statistics.


  0   Strengtheningcivil service capacity by developing and initiating implementation o f a civil
      service reform strategy and strengthening the payroll system.


  0   Revitalizing the groundnut sector by adopting a new regulatory framework and launching the
      auditing o f the government-owned groundnut processing and marketing firm, in preparation
      o f its eventual divestiture.

5.3.    The development objectives are consistent with pillars one (macroeconomic stability and
public sector reform) and two (promotion o f pro-poor growth and employment through private
sector development) o f the government's national development program outlined in the PRSP.
They are also consistent with the strategic objectives o f the JAS: (i)strengthening economic
management and public service delivery; and (ii)    enhancing productive capacity and accelerating
growth and competitiveness.

5.4.    There has been relatively good progress in implementing the Policy Matrix, including
specifically IDA'Sproposedprior actions. The government's Letter o f Development Policy (LDP)
describes the implementation o f the PRSP, including reform measures in the Policy Matrix (see
Annex 1). The LDP highlights progress made in maintaining macroeconomic stability, reforming



                                                - 1 7 -

the public sector, promoting private sector development, improving the delivery o f basic social
services, and implementing cross-sectoral programs on gender, environment and HIVIAIDS.

5.5.    Table 4 details the proposed Grant's prior actions. They were selected due to their
importance to the government's reform program, and government's commitment and institutional
capacity for implementation. Compliance with these prior actions as defined in the Financing
Agreement forms the basis for IDAto proceedto the disbursemento fthe proposedGrant.

5.6.    The AfDB has identified three prior actions for its budget support for US$4.5 million,
listed inBox 1 and highlightedin italic in the Policy Matrix. The AfDB's prior actions, which are
expected to be completed in the second half of CY09, are a continuation of the reforms captured
by IDA'Sproposedprior actions, inthe areas o f government revenues, budgetingand civil service
capacity. The EC i s expected to provide the first tranche o f its planned budget support,
approximately Euro 22 million over 2010-12, inthe first half o f CY10. For the first disbursement,
the EC intendsto select its prior actions from reform measures for 2009 inthe PolicyMatrix.


                      Box 1:Triggers for the AfDB Budget SupportDisbursement

  The AfDB has selectedthe following three triggers for their budget support grant targeted for the second
  half o f CY09:

  1. Submit to the National Assembly the 2009 Budget which is inline with the PRSPpriorities.

  2. Submit to National Assembly audited accounts for 2005 to 2006.

  3. Design and start implementation o fnew training policy which focuses on local training.


5.7.    The government, IDA, AfDB and the EC will formalize the sharing o f a common Policy
Matrix through a MOU. This M O U will outline the arrangements for a Partnership Framework for
coordinating financing, disbursements, monitoring and evaluation to the maximum extent possible.
The World Bank's Good Practice Principles on Conditonality were applied to the proposed
arrangements and the IDA'Sprior actions (see Box 2). The MOU allows for an annual review o f
progress in implementing the Policy Matrix during which participants can consider revising the
reform agenda as necessitated by developing circumstances and adjustments in government
policies. For the annual review n2009, the government has already expressed interest inexpanding
the scope o f the matrix to additional sectors, such as the social sectors. Only the EC's support
would be potentially affected by the expansion o f the PolicyMatrix in2009.

5.8.    As would be indicated by the signingo fthe MOU, IDA intends to participate inthe annual
reviews even after the release o f its single tranche. In fact, the M O U encourages the participation
o f additional development partners in the Partnership Framework, regardless o f whether they plan
on providing budget support. It will be critical for IDA to continue to participate in the annual
reviews o f the government's Policy Matrix in order to be part o f the policy dialogue on some o f
the most critical PRSP related reform initiatives and to monitor the completion and eventual
impact of the reforms initiated through support from IDA'Ssingle tranche.

5.9.    The Partnership Framework reinforces cooperation between the government and the
development partners and also facilitates coordinating the use o f IDA'Sother instruments to




                                                  - 19-

support the Policy Matrix, as i s already the case with the groundnut sector reforms.13 After the
release of its single tranche, IDA can potentially add value to the policy dialogue through its policy
advice. It has already played major roles in supporting the government to analyze and develop
policies inthe three major reform areas under the Policy Matrix.


                              Box 2: GoodPracticePrinciples on Conditionality

  Principle1:Reinforceownership
  There i s a strong country ownership o f the program design given that it i s based on the PRSP which was
  prepared through a highly participatory and consultative process. Stakeholder consultative workshops and
  focus group discussions were held with representatives o f the public and private sectors and civil society,
  down to the level o f local communities. There has also been extensive analytical work which has
  informed policy formulation ina timely manner.

  Principle2: Agree up front withthe governmentand other financial partnerson a coordinated
  accountability framework
  There i s a joint Policy Matrix shared by all the donors planning on providing budget support. Prior
  actions for donor disbursements are identified in the Policy Matrix, thus allowing for aid coordination.
  Policy dialogues are conducted jointly and joint appraisal missions are planned to assess progress in
  implementing the Policy Matrix.

  Principle3: Customizethe accountability framework and modalitiesof Bank support to country
  circumstances

  The joint Policy Matrix was developed inclose coordination with the government and the various sectors,
  thus ensuring that it reflects the government's expressed policy intentions and the country's
  circumstances. The design o f policy reforms has been backedby analytical work. Most o f the reforms are
  either ongoing or extensions o f ongoing government initiatives which are prioritized in government sector
  reform strategies. Donor coordination on the budget support has reduced transaction costs and the
  expected timingo f the IDA disbursement i s aligned with the government's domestic budgeting process.

  Principle4: Chooseonly actions criticalfor achieving results as conditions for disbursement
  Prior actions are chosen from the Policy Matrix and focused on measures that are critical to achieving the
  objectives o f the program. The matrix i s selective and streamlined, consisting o f only nine prior actions
  for the Bank's operation. There are two prior actions that consist o f preparing strategies or action plans
  but these are considered critical for achieving development objectives and are linked to major future
  actions already identified inthe Policy Matrix.

  Principle5: Conduct transparent progressreviews conduciveto predictable andperformance-
  basedfinancial support
  The government and the participating donors plan on conducting annual joint progress reviews of the
  implementation o f the Policy Matrix. The reviews are expected to promote results orientation given that
  the Policy Matrix includes benchmark indicators which are results-focused,




  l3For IDA, the policy dialogue on the groundnut sector was essentially jointly led by the teams for the DPO and
  Gateway project, an investment project, with the former focusing on the overall policy issues and the latter on the
  complementary investments necessary to implement the policies (see section 5, Policy Area 3).

                       POLICY AREA1:IMPROVINGTHE USE OF PUBLICRESOURCES

  PublicFinancialManagement

5.10.   Description and Challenges. The government has been making significant strides in
improving its public financial management capacity, as reflected inthe preliminary findings o f the
ongoing CFAA (FY09). Major reforms have improved the transparency and accountability in the
use o f public resources and reduced the opportunities for corruption, including: (i)   updating the
legislative framework for budget management and public procurement; (ii)developing an
Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS); (iii)reducing the backlog of
government accounts; and (iv) establishing the Gambia Public Procurement Authority (GPPA).
The key challenges are to continue implementing the ongoing reforms so that they become
entrenched and sustainable, while also initiating additional and complementary reforms in budget
preparation, aid coordination and internal auditing.

5.11. Budget preparation, execution and monitoring: The government, the World Bank and other
donors jointly conducted a series of Public Expenditure Reviews (PERs) from FY04 to FY06.
Some o f the major findings were: (i)significant increases in debt services were crowding out other
recurrent expenditures, including PRSP related expenditures; (ii)the total wage bill has
substantially declined, indicating a serious deterioration o f civil service compensation; (iii)
recurrent expenditures have not kept pace with development expenditures (public investments);
(iv) the share of expenditures for general administrative sectors are relatively highwhile the share
for economic services are relatively low; (v) recurrent expenditures for the social sectors had
steadily declined; (vi) budget execution and monitoring had major shortcomings due to significant
backlogs in the preparation o f annual audited public accounts and monthly fiscal reports; and (vii)
central monitoring o f development expenditures was weak.

5.12.   Efforts to address many o f the shortcomings identified inthe PERs began with the updating
o f the legal framework through the Budget Management and Accountability Act (2004) which
strengthened the transparency, accountability and comprehensiveness o f the budget process. The
budget classification was substantially improved, with the incorporation o f Government Finance
Statistics (GFS) standards, the integration o f recurrent and development expenditures, and the
incorporation o fbudget codes which identify PRSP related expenditures.

5.13.   A priority fiscal policy has beenthe reduction o f debt service and the stock o f public debt,
in order to expand the fiscal space for PRSP related expenditures. The primarybalance has been
maintained as a significant surplus, domestic borrowing constrained, and the country received
substantial debt relief through the HIPC completion point achieved in December 2007. As a result,
interest payments declined from a peak o f 47 percent o f recurrent expenditures in 2005 to 24
percent in 2008.14 This has allowed the government to reverse the decline in civil service
compensation by raising salaries by 20 percent in 2008, with further increases envisioned for
future years.

5.14.   The budgeting system has been significantly strengthened through the adoption o f IFMIS,
which began operations in January 2007 and covers the entire central government. It is being


  14See section 2 for further details on fiscal policies and debt sustainability.



                                                            -21 -

developed and implemented through two phases, with phase one recently completed in the last
quarter o f CYO8. The system i s currently processing all payments and the payroll, and it
incorporates commitment controls which facilitate fiscal discipline. The IFMIS was used to
produce the 2007 government public accounts and the 2009 budget and currently produces
monthly fiscal and poverty related expenditures reports. Publishing these fiscal reports would
contribute to greater transparency and accountability o f government operations. Government staffs
have received extensive training on IFMIS as well as on basic IT and accounting skills. Inorder to
ensure the sustainability o f the system, the government has prepared an IFMIS sustainability plan
which outlines recurrent costs for operating and maintaining the system and investments to build
local human resource capacity.

5.15.   Transforming the budget into a more policy-oriented tool continues to be a major
challenge. With this objective inmind, the government has been planning to adopt a MediumTerm
Expenditure Framework (MTEF) which would link PRSP priority outputs and outcomes with
public expenditure programs within a mediumterm fiscal framework. However, progress has been
slow and the budgetingprocess still remains mostly annual and incremental. Preferring a gradual
approach to adopting a MTEF, the government has now opted to focus on improving the sectoral
budget formulation process. Major sectors are now expected to develop output and outcome targets
linked to expenditures as part o f their budget submissions. In line with this approach, the
Department o f State for Educationrecently prepared a sectoral MTEF. The sectoral budgetswould
also be improved if the balance between recurrent and investment expenditures was assessed and
revised as necessary.

5.16.   Effective budget planning and monitoring depends on timely information on budget
outturn. IFMIS provides this information for locally funded recurrent expenditures. However,
centralized information on externally financed projects (development expenditures) has been
lacking. Inresponse, DOSFEAhas established an Aid Coordination Unit which will be responsible
for collecting timely data on donor financed projects as well as generally coordinating the
preparation and management o fprojects.

5.17. There had been significant backlogs in the preparation and auditing o f government
accounts, thus seriously undermining fiscal transparency and accountability. The accounts have
now been prepared up to 2007 and therefore the backlog on the government financial statements
has been eliminated. The last external audit o f the government accounts was for 1999. The
government finalized the audits for 2000 to 2004 and submitted them to the National Assembly in
January 2009. The government planon finalizing the audits for 2005 to 2007 by September 2009.

5.18.   The government currently does not have a functioning internal audit unit. The unit exists
only in name as its activities have been limited to pre-audit internal control procedures. Even this
task has become redundant due to the internal control functions built into IFMIS. The
establishment o f a functioning internal audit unit would reduce the fiduciary risk to the control and
accountability o f government funds.

5.19. Poverty reducing expenditures: A key challenge i s to ensure increasing shares o f poverty
reducing expenditures. Poverty related expenditures are those expenditures which the government
has identified as PRSP priorities. The government budget codes identify these expenditures for
each line item. The shares are defined as percentages o f total locally funded expenditures,



                                                 - 22 -

inclusive o f both the recurrent (current) and development (capital) expenditures, excluding interest
payments and including arrears payments.

5.20.   For the budget outturn, poverty reducing expenditures declined from 50 percent in 2002 to
36 percent in 2006 but they have since then increased to 43 percent in 2007 and 54 percent in
2008. Note that the share for 2008 should be considered preliminary iven that the fiscal year only
recently closed and the government accounts have not be prepared." Note that the decline in the
shares o f poverty reducing expenditures from 2002 to 2006 largely coincided with rapidly
increasing interest payments, which in 2005 were almost twice as large as poverty reducing
expenditures. Rising interest payments were a legacy o f earlier fiscal and monetary slippages
which significantly increased the domestic debt and interest rates. Efforts to restore fiscal
discipline meant that discretionary recurrent expenditures, including on poverty reducing
expenditures, were further constrained in the short term. In recent years, the shares o f poverty
reducing expenditures appear to have significantly increased as the fiscal space expanded in
response to declining interest payments.

5.21.   Public procurement: The Gambia Public Procurement Act (2001) provides the framework
for an open, non-discriminatory and transparent procurement system. The legislation supports
national anti-corruption initiatives and harmonizes public procurement policies and tools. The
Gambia Public Procurement Authority (GPPA) was created in 2002 with the responsibility for
implementing the new legal and regulatory framework and reviewing all large contract awards.
The central tender board was replacedby decentralized procurement committees and units.




  l5The budget outturn has been difficult to track due to the lack o f reliable data and therefore these findings should
  be considered preliminary. Since IFMIS has been operational only since 2007, the availability o f reliable past data
  continues to be a problem.


                                                              - 23 -

5.22.   The Country Procurement Issues Paper (CPIP) prepared in 2005 assessed the public
procurement system and recommended that GPPA should not carry out both the regulatory and
operational control functions, procedures and documentation should be further streamlined and
simplified and the threshold for prior review should be reviewed and raised if necessary. The
government recently revisited these recommendations and now plans on preparing and
implementing an action planbased on the CPIP findings.

5.23.   Government's PolicyMatrix ReformActions for 2008. The government's Policy Matrix
outlines nine key reform measures on public financial management in 2008. Among these nine
reform measures, IDA has selected three to be prior actions for IDA'S disbursement. The
completion o f all the prior actions, which would include the three below as well as six additional
prior actions inother reform areas (see table 4), would provide the basis for IDA'Sdisbursemento f
its proposed Grant.

Departments, timely preparation o f the government accounts, publication o f quarterly fiscal
reports, continued reduction o f the backlog in auditing the accounts, ensuring the sustainability o f
IFMIS, establishment of a functioning internal audit unit, strengthening the institutional
arrangements for aid coordination, and separating the regulatory and control functions o f GPPA.

5.25.   Expected Results. The implementation o f the above reform measures is expected to
improve resource allocations, fiscal management and public service delivery. Ensuringthat IFMIS
will be sustainable will strengthen all stages o f budget preparation, execution and monitoring. The
preliminarysteps towards the development o f a MTEFcan gradually turnthe budgetinto aresults-
oriented policy tool and strengthen the linkages between PRSP policy priorities and the budget.
Strengthened internal and external audits would improve the transparency and accountability o f the
use o f public resources. Procurement reform measures would improve the efficiency o f public
procurement and contribute towards enhancing the value o f government purchases.

  RevenueAdministration

5.26.   Description and Challenges. The Gambia Revenue Authority (GRA) Act (2004) created
the semiautonomous GRA which merged administration o f income and sales tax with customs.
The establishment o f the GRA contributed to the enhancement o f the legitimacy and
professionalism o f tax administration, the improvement o f taxpayer services and the promotion o f
uniform application o f tax laws. The newly created GRA Board, comprising both public and
private sector representatives, has been actively engaged inthe reform process. Tax administration
capacity has been strengthened through organizational restructuring, training and technical
assistance, and upgrades of the IT systems. Improved tax administration has contributed to an
average domestic tax revenue o f 21 percent of GDP since 2004, one o f the highest inthe region.

5.27.   Key future challenges are to consolidate ongoing reforms, improve customer service and
further strengthenthe institutional capacity o f GRAYincluding by filling inall the critical posts in
the new organization. Regular surveys o f taxpayers will allow GRA to identify shortcomings in
customer service.l7Specific challenges include broadening the taxpayer base, rationalizing central
and local government taxes, strengtheningexternal and internal audits and reducing discretionary
approvals o f duty exemptions.

5.28.   Government's Policy Matrix Reform Actions for 2008. There are two major reform
actions plannedfor 2008, one of which i s a prior action for the proposed Grant.

  IDA'SPrior Action

      Gambia Revenue Authority (GRA): (i)         endorses a three-year strategic plan; (ii)

       Develop and agree on performance targets for the new GRA staff appraisal system, based on
       the overall targets set by Finance. (completed)

5.29.   Future reform measures in the government's Policy Matrix for 2009-10 are continuations
o f the 2008 reforms, consisting o f continued implementation o f the GRA strategic plan based on
performance targets andconducting staff appraisals linked to promotion and training decisions.

5.30.    Expected Results. The proposed reform measures will improve the efficiency,
transparency and effectiveness o f revenue administration. They would contribute to maintaining
the current high levels o f revenue collection, thus providing the fiscal space for PRSP related
expenditures.

  OfficialStatistics

5.3 1. Descriptionand Challenges.The Statistics Act (2005) provides the legislative framework
for the national statistical system. It provided the legal mandate for transforming the existing
government statistical agency into the new semiautonomous Gambia Bureau o f Statistics (GBOS).
The creation o f a semiautonomous agency is meant to strengthenthe delivery of statistical outputs
and client-orientation, improve the conditions o f service and reduce the heavy bureaucratic burden
o f the government. The GBOS i s the principal body responsible for collecting and disseminating
official statistical data and monitoring and coordinating the national statistical system. The
Statistics Act also established the Statistics Council which acts as the Board for GBOS and
supervises the national statistical system.

5.32.    Structural reforms will continue to focus on strengtheningthe capacity o f GBOS, based on
the "Strategic Plan for the Development of Statistics inThe Gambia: 2008-11." The plan calls for
GBOS to: develop work programs with performance targets; continue recruitment o f new staffs;
improve archiving and dissemination o f data; and strengthen the data infrastructure, with the
immediate priority on economic statistics. Social and agricultural statistics also require
strengthening, including the updating o f the household survey last conducted in 2003. Instead o f
funding discrete ad hoc surveys, donors are encouraged to fund the reform program either by
pooling funds or targeting specific parts o f the program.

5.33.   Government's Policy Matrix Reform Actions for 2008. The government's reform
agenda includes two reforms o f official statistics for 2008, one o f which i s a prior action for the
proposed Grant. They focus on strengthening of the statistics infrastructure and institutional
capacity building

  IDA's Prior Action

      GBOS publishes the economic census and the National Accounts. (completed)



  18 These are reform measures in the government's Policy Matrix which were not selected to be IDA's prior actions.
  The government intends to implement these reforms but they will not specifically determine the release o f IDA's
  proposed Grant.

  Non-Prior action^'^

5.34.   Futurereform measures inthe government's Policy Matrix for 2009-10 consist o f agreeing
with DOSFEA on a performance "contract," preparing annual progress reports on the performance
contract, and timely production o f economic statistics.

5.35.   ExpectedResults.The reform measures are expected to contribute to improved quality and
timeliness o f official statistics. This in turn would enhance government capacity for policy
formulation and targeted allocation o fpublic resources.

                     POLICYAREA2: STRENGTHENING                CIVIL SERVICE CAPACITY

5.36.   Descriptionand Challenges.Civil service reform has beenpart o f the government reform
agenda for many years, as highlightedinthe PRSP, but untilrecently there hadbeen little progress.
The government mostly focused on isolated capacity building o f targeted sectors, often with
support from donor funded projects. With the realization that a comprehensive reform program
was a priority, the government and the World Bank, AfDB and DFID conducted an overall
analysis o f the key capacity constraints to civil service performance. The findings are outlined in
the 2008 report "The Gambia Improving Civil Service Performance" and a complementary report
"The Gambia Public Service Pensions Policy Reform Note" which focused on the government
pension system.

5.37.   The first report cited the country's low ratings on governance, specifically government
effectiveness, voice and accountability and control o f corruption. Notable shortcomings include
limited independence o f the legislature and the judiciary, frequent dismissals and transfers o f
public officials without due process, lack o f transparency and access to information on public
services, and weak anti-corruption measures.

5.38.   With respect to the issues specific to the civil service, the report concluded that: (i) size         the
o f the civil service and the wage bill are relatively reasonable; (ii)           staff composition rather than
size is the most critical problem, given the substantial loss o f upper grade staffs in recent years
which has seriously eroded professional and managerial capacity (see Table 5); (iii)                 a major cause
o f the deterioration i s civil service salaries and benefits which are extremely low even by low
income country standards; (iv) human resource management i s incremental, non-strategic and
lacks centralizedplanning and coordination; and (v) pensionbenefits are too low and unpredictable
and create weak incentives and inequities among different cohorts.

5.39.   The report outlines several reform options for the short and medium terms. They focus on
improving civil service salaries and benefits in a fiscally sustainable manner and strengthening
human resource management and training. The improvement o f civil service compensation, which
includes salaries, allowances and benefits, should be outlined in a medium term pay reform
strategy consistent with the macroeconomic framework. The report also recommends that
allowances, which have significantly risen from an average o f 16 percent o f total pay in 1985 to 38
percent in 2007, should be folded into salaries in order to enhance transparency and reduce


  19 These are reformmeasures inthe government's Policy Matrix which were not selected to be IDA's prior actions.
  The government intends to implement these reforms but they will not specifically determine the release o f IDA's
  proposed Grant.

discretionary determination o f pay. However, the report recommends that relocation and hardship
allowances be retained as they appear to have helped rural placement o f staffs. Pay increases
should be proportionately larger for higher grades in order to decompress salaries, which would
help stem the loss ofprofessional and managerial staffs. Preliminary analysis indicates that there is
some fiscal space for pay increases. As a first step, the government has already increased civil
service salaries in2008 by 20 percent.

5.40.   Without improved human resource management, simply increasing salaries will not
necessarily result in improved performance. The relevant institutional and legal frameworks need
to be updated. The main relevant agencies, the Personnel Management Office (PMO) and the
Public Service Commission (PSC), currently focus mostly on operational activities. As a result,
human resource planning i s mostly short term and incremental. These agencies could perform
more strategic and regulatory roles and gradually hand over operational responsibilities to the line
Departments.

5.41.   Human resource information systems are weak and unreliable, and comprehensive and
timely data are generally unavailable. The incorporation o f a payroll module in IFMIS has
strengthened the HR system. However, the personnel management system should eventually be
integrated with the payroll module and the underlying flow o f information would still need to be
improved inorder for the system to capture all relevant data.

5.42.   A functioning performance appraisal system currently does not exist. Promotions are still
largely based on seniority and senior positions are filled through political appointments. The lack
o f practical, job-related, in-country training i s one of the main causes o f civil service capacity
constraints. Ninety percent o f the government's training budget i s spent on training a few staffs
overseas, who often do not stay long inthe government.

5.43.   Based on the findings o f the aforementioned analytical reports, the government has
developed an overall strategic paper, "Public Sector Reform Sector Strategy Paper 2007-2011."
This strategy paper was adopted by the Cabinet and a multi-stakeholder Cabinet Subcommittee,
the Civil Service Reform Board, was established to guide its implementation. The strategy paper
encompasses public sector reform broadly and civil service reform more specifically. It outlines
four overall reform objectives:

    (i)   Improve the civil service remuneration package in order to recruit and retain highly
    trained and professional staffs;


                                                   - 28 -

     (ii)Strengthen      institutional capacity for policy formulation, human resources development,
     and coordination and monitoring o f public sector management and programs;

     (iii)Improve the governance and management of the civil service in order to ensure
     transparency and accountability and promote ethical values and standards in order to create a
     meritbased system within the public service; and

     (iv) Develop the capacity o f the Directorate o f Local Governance, Subsectoral departments
     and Departments of State to assist the decentralizationprocess.

5.44.    The government's civil service reform strategy puts a major emphasis on the need to
address low civil service compensation, while also maintaining fiscal sustainability. Inthis regard,
the government increased salaries and wages by 20 percent in 2008 and had planned further
increases in2009 and 2010. However, the global economic slowdown resulted inthe government's
domestic revenue declining from 21.4 percent in2007 to 18.6 percent in2008 and it i s projected to
remain at the lower levels for the near future. In order to maintain fiscal sustainability, it was
decided to delay further pay increases until adequate fiscal resources were identified. The wage bill
i s projected to remain at 5.2 percent in 2009 and 5.5 percent 2010, which would be considered a
reasonable size. Although an across-the-board increase was postponed, the government still
recognized that pay enhancement was critical to its strategy to reforming the civil service,
particularly for improving recruitment and retention o f professional and managerial staffs.
Therefore, a special fund o f 50 million dalasis was established in2009, o f which 20 million dalasis
would provide allowances targeting professionals and upper grade managerial staffs.20In order to
ensure adequate fiscal space for civil service pay increases, it will be critical to centrally monitor
and control new recruitments so that the size o f the civil service does not increase at an
unmanageable rate.

5.45.    The key champions o f the reforms are the Secretary General, the PMO and the PSC. As the
Head o f the civil service, the Secretary General provides the overall political leadership to the
exercise. The PMO and PSC coordinate the preparation o f the civil service reform strategy with
key government agencies, including the major line Departments (Ministries) and DOSFEA on the
pay reforms. A multi-stakeholder task force which prepared the strategy continues to meet
regularly in order to coordinate the implementation o f the strategy. The multi-stakeholder Civil
Service Reform Board provides overall guidance to the reforms and facilitates coordination among
various Departments. A survey o f government officials, which was incorporated into the civil
service strategy, strengthened ownership o f the strategy by the civil servants.

5.46.    There does not appear to be specific stakeholders opposed to the reforms, given that it does
not involve downsizing o f the government and focuses on improving civil service compensation
combined with better management o f performance. However, there still are several risks to the
reforms: (i) constraint, brought on by the global economic downturn, which could delay
                fiscal
planned salary increases; (ii)      significant increases in the size o f civil service, resulting from lax
centralized management o f new recruitments; and (iii)            focus on pay increases, at the expense o f
adequate focus on improving performance management. Such risks need to be addressed through

continuous dialogue among all key stakeholders and adjustments o f the civil service reform
strategy as necessitated by developing circumstances.

5.47.    Government's Policy Matrix Reform Actions for 2008. The propose Grant will support
the initiation o f civil service reforms in 2008. It focuses on the government's efforts to formally
adopt a civil service reform strategy and strengthen its HR information system in 2008. These
initiatives are the initial steps to further reforms by the government in 2009-10 which would
strengthen civil service capacity. All reform measures for 2008 are prior actions and hence there
are no non-prior actions.

5.48.    Future reform measures in the government's Policy Matrix for 2009 and 2010 include:
implementing the civil service reform strategy and monitoring its implementation progress,
particularly pay reform; developing and implementing a government training policy focused on
local training; pilotingperformance appraisal systems inkey Departments (ministries); integrating
the personnel management system with the payroll system in IFMIS; and tracking personnel
turnover (attrition) rates.

5.49.    Expected Results. The proposed reforms will initiate the process o f strengthening civil
service capacity for improved public service delivery. They are expected to contribute towards
eventually strengthening the government's ability to recruit and retain qualified staffs, provide
themwith adequate incentives and improve the management o ftheir performance.

                       POLICY AREA3: REVITALIZINGTHE GROUNDNUT                       SECTOR

5.50.    Description and Challenges. Groundnuts remain the country's main cash crop and its
production, handling, processing and marketingengage directly or indirectly over 80 percent o f the
population and 40 percent o f the land under cultivation. Groundnuts have traditionally been the
dominant export, accounting for 60 percent o f total exports. Nearly 77 percent o f groundnut
households were classified as poor, compared to 46 percent o f other households.

5.51.    Although the groundnut sector can be a major contributor to The Gambia's economic
growth and poverty reduction, inrecent years it has been unable to fulfill its potential due to severe
structural deficiencies. Sector performance has been very erratic both for production and exports,
undermined by sharp policy reversals. The Gambia Groundnut Corporation (GGC), the public
groundnut processing plants, i s the major buyer and exporter o f groundnuts and its effective and
efficient operation i s crucial to the performance o f the sector. GGC was privatized in the early

1990s but then it was re-nationalized in the early 2000s. Subsequently, the management of the
sector was restructured based on a new regulatory framework, the Framework of Agreement
(FOA), agreed between the government and the sector operators. However, this arrangement was
circumvented by the government in 2004 when it introduced a new licensing scheme which then
awarded a monopoly license to GAMCO, a new public-private joint venture. When GAMCO was
unable to absorb the market, exports collapsed from US$17 million in 2004 to US$2 million in
2005. Since then, the government opened the market to multiple operators and GAMCO has gone
into liquidation proceedings after the government took over its substantial debt to the commercial
banks.

5.52.   Erratic policies and the poor performance o f GGC have undermined the capacity o f the
sector to support the groundnut farmers. The uncertainty regarding timely cash purchases by GGC
has frequently resulted in farmers selling their groundnuts in the informal markets at a heavy
discount compared to the official producer price. Underinvestmentinthe sector's infrastructure has
resulted in inefficient transportation and processing o f groundnuts, which in turn constrain
producer prices. The sector's poor performance continues to expose the government to significant
contingent liabilities as the government feels politically compelled to intervene. The country's
groundnut exports in 2008 are expected to remain at a historical low o f 0.3 percent o f GDP,
compared to 4.2 percent as recently as in2004. For the 2007/8 season, it i s estimated that the GGC
handled less than 4,000 tons o f groundnuts, following the 7,000 tons handled in the previous year
and a sharp decline from the 30,000 tons in the 2005-06 seasons. Production was further affected
by intermittent rainfall andthe lack o fcritical inputssuch as certified seeds and fertilizers.

                                  Box 3: InternationalGroundnutsMarket

  Groundnuts are one o f the world's major oilseed crops. Due to high levels o f self-consumption, only 5
  percent o f the world production i s sold in the international market. The main producers and exporters are
  China, India, USA and Argentina, while SSA countries (Senegal, The Gambia, Nigeria, Malawi, South
  Africa and Sudan) account for only roughly 5 percent o f the world market, down from a high o f 17
  percent in 1976. However, Senegal i s the world's largest exporter in the thinner groundnut oil market.
  The main importers are the EC, Canada, Japan and South Korea.

  There has been an overall gradual liberalization o f groundnuts trade policies in various countries, in part
  in order to fulfill commitments under WTO agreements. High import tariffs, up to 85 percent in India,
  have contributed to artificially depress world prices. World trade liberalization, including the removal o f
  trade distortions inIndia and China, could potentially increase groundnut prices by 10 to 27 percent above
  current levels (Beghin et a1 (2006)).

  Groundnuts and groundnut oil command among the highest prices in the world market. After increasing
  inthe 1970s, international groundnut prices (CIF Rotterdam) have largely fluctuated aroundUS$850-900
  per metric ton up to 2006, then sharply increased to an average o f US$1,700 duringthe 2007/08 season,
  ina pattern similar to other major oilseed crops. However, the low quality of its groundnuts, resultingin
  heavy price discounts, and difficulties in delivering supplies have meant that The Gambia has often been
  unable to fully take advantage o f recent international price increases.

5.53.    One o f the HIPC completion point triggers was the privatization o f GGC. The government
conducted the advertisement and selection process but was unsuccessful in finding a sufficiently
qualified bidder. In response, the government prepared the "Groundnut Subsector Roadmap
Implementation Framework," in consultations with key public and private stakeholders and
development partners, includingextended policy dialogue with the World Bank. The objective o f
the Roadmap i s to restore sustained growth in the groundnut sector and improve the livelihood o f
groundnut farmers by providing a reliable and timely market for groundnuts based on minimum
producer prices, increasing pass-through o f international prices to the farmers, and enhancing
productivity at all levels o f the value chain. It would achieve this through market liberalization and
open competition, based on: (i)strengthening o f the policy and regulatory framework; (ii)
divestiture o f GGC though options that include full privatization and private management; (iii)
maintaining a minimum producer price to protect the farmers; (iv) establishment o f a quality
control system; (v) improvement o f access to agricultural production inputs; and (vi) strengthening
o f farmer support institutions, including producer organizations. The Roadmap Implementation
Steering Committee (RISC) was formed to guide the implementation o f the Roadmap, inparticular
the divestiture o f GGC. The RISC has multi-stakeholder public and private representation,
including farmers associations.

5.54.    Although the completion point trigger on the privatization o f GGC was not achieved, in
December 2007 the Boards o f the IDA and the IMFapproved the HIPC completion point based on
the progress made in implementing the Roadmap, including: (i)        allowing immediate free entry o f
operators at all levels o f the value chain; (ii) transferring management responsibility o f the sector
to the Agribusiness Services and Producers Association (ASPA), an association o f the sector's
public andprivate stakeholders; and (iii)   dissolving the Board of Directors o f GGC which hadbeen
intervening in the daily operations o f the company. It was understood that the government would
continue to implement the Roadmap, supported by the proposedGrant.

5.55.    Since the HIPC completion point, there has been progress in implementing the Roadmap.
As part o fthe Roadmap, a new FOA was developed and was signed by the government and ASPA
in December 2008. This is a critical step towards restructuring the sector as the FOA is the
regulatory framework which outlines the respective roles o f the government and private
stakeholders, based on the principle o f private sector promotion inthe groundnut sector. ASPA on
its own determinedthe producer price for the 2008-09 marketingseason. Inorder to prepare for the
divestiture o f GGC, the government i s currently tendering for the necessary financial andtechnical
audits and also the rehabilitation work on GGC's industrial assets, with support from the Bank's
Trade Gateway project. As an emergency measure, the government has purchased groundnut seeds
and fertilizers which will be distributed to farmers as a loan to be repaid in-kind. The government
i s also tendering for the technical assistance to develop a quality assurance framework (see Box 4
for details).

5.56.    The financial and technical audits o f GGC will include a review of all divestiture options.
Key domestic stakeholders will discuss and select the optimal divestiture option based on the
findings o f the audits, in the process building country ownership. Afterwards, the tender process
can proceed to carrying out the divestiture process. The divestiture process i s expected to be
finalized by mid-2010, thus allowing the private operator of GGC adequate time to prepare for the
2010-11groundnut marketing season.

                 Box 4: Current Status of GroundnutSector ReformRoadmapInitiatives

  Strengthening of Policy and Regulatory Framework. The newly developed FOA and ASPA's new
  Statute o f Incorporation broadly outline the sector's regulatory framework and the roles and
  responsibilities o f the government vis-&vis ASPA; the government i s responsible for public policies and
  the legal and regulatory framework, while ASPA i s responsible for the management o f the common
  goods, such as the determination o f the minimumproducer prices, licensing eligibility criteria and quality
  and sanitary standards. The next steps are for the government to develop in greater detail specific areas o f
  the legal and institutional regulatory framework, including the: Producer Price Determination Mechanism;
  Producer Price Equalizer Mechanism; Eligibility Criteria for licensed operation, allowing for open
  competition; and Quality Assurance Integration Framework. The World Bank's Gateway i s providing the
  relevant technical assistance.

  Divestiture of GGC. The government is currently carrying out the tendering for the financial and
  technical audits o f GGC and minimumrehabilitation o f its industrial infrastructure, consisting o f the river
  transport fleet, depots and processing plant. The tendering process for the financial audit was completed
  inDecember 2008 and the tendering for the technical audits and rehabilitation works are expected to be
  completed by first quarter o f CY09. The World Bank's Gateway project i s funding the audits and will
  fund the subsequent divestiture tender process. The Gateway project and the EC are sharing the funding
  for the rehabilitation o f the industrial assets.

  Establishing a Quality Control System. The government is currently tendering for the development o f
  the policies and regulations for a quality assurance framework and for the necessary sorting and grading
  equipment for the depots and laboratory equipment and training for the national laboratories. The quality
  assurance framework will outline the roles o f both the public and private sectors. The EC will fund the
  necessary technical assistance.

  Improving Access to Agricultural Production Inputs. Since the closure of the EC funded Seed
  Multiplication Project and the Autonomous Credit Project, provision o f inputs has been irregular and
  insufficient. The EC recently funded the procurement o f groundnut seeds and fertilizers which will be
  distributed to farmers as a loan to be repaid in-kind. ASPA i s currently developing a Crop Finance
  Provision Mechanism in consultation with local financial institutions and plans on subsequently
  discussing the mechanism with donor partners.

  StrengtheningFarmer Support Institutions.On a pilot basis, there has been some indication that grass
  roots producer organizations have had some success in purchasing, collecting and handling small lots o f
  producers for bulk delivery to operators and traders. However, there i s a needto expand such initiatives to
  a more comprehensive capacity buildingprogram for producer associations.

  Groundnut Subsector Roadmap Implementation Framework" (2007) and "Framework o fAgreement" (2008).

5.57.   Improving the groundnuts quality control system has become a priority given the
significant deterioration o f the quality o f groundnuts in recent years. This includes the lack o f
control over the level o f aflotoxin (mycotoxin), which has made it difficult to export to the
European markets. A detailed report (ECORYS report, 2006) already exists which outlines a
comprehensive set o f quality control measures for the entire value chain, from farm-gate to
exports. This report i s expected to be the basis for a program to strengthenthe overall groundnuts
quality control system. Critical activities include improving the testing capacity o f GGC and the
National Agricultural Research Institute (NARI), establishing proper handling and control




                                                     - 33 -

techniques during processing o f groundnuts, installing adequate sorting mechanisms at the depot
levels, and rehabilitating the river barges.

5.58.   The producers associations need to be appropriately restructured and strengthened. The
farmers associations in The Gambia consist o f the Cooperative Produce Marketing Societies
(CPMS) and its apex body, the Federation o f Agricultural Cooperative Societies (FACS). FACS
and the CPMSs were established in order to finance, collect and evacuate groundnuts from their
marketing points (seccos) to GGC's depots. However, they have been largely ineffective and as a
result operators and traders became progressively reluctant to pre-finance FACS for the purchase
o f groundnuts. Pilot initiatives supported byNGOs such as ActionAid have shown some success in
grass roots producer organizations purchasing and delivering groundnuts to operators and traders.
However, such initiatives would need to be significantly expanded to a comprehensive capacity
buildingprogram.

5.59.   The reforms o f the groundnut sector should be viewed inthe context o f the overall reforms
o f the agriculture sector. The increases in import food prices that took place in 2007-8 have
spurred the government, with support from FAO, WFP and the Bank, to develop a Country Action
Plan (CAP) which outlines policies for: (i)      increasing agricultural production and productivity
through improved access to inputs and extension services; (ii)       enhancing social safety nets and
support to food security, including school feeding programs; and (iii)      strengthening institutional
capacity o f key public and private stakeholders, including producer associations. In support o f the
CAP, the Bank i s currently in the process o f seeking funds from the E C to support the
implementation o f the CAP. In parallel, the government plans to substantially increase its own
budget allocations for the agriculture sector, deconcentrate agricultural services and restructure the
National Agricultural Development Agency (NADA), the government's main operational agency
for agriculture.

5.60.   Sustained political commitment and country ownership will be critical to the success o f the
groundnut sector reforms. It would be understandable to question the country's commitment to the
reforms given past policy reversals. However, it i s precisely the general acknowledgement o f the
failures o f these policy missteps which has galvanized support for the Roadmap reforms. Country
ownership o f the Roadmap has been strengthened through wide consultations and participation o f
both public and private stakeholders, including farmers association and private operators. These
same stakeholders are part o f ASPA and hence directly participate in the management o f the
sector. The major champion o f the reforms i s the Secretary o f State (Minister) o f Finance, who led
the development o f the Roadmap and was the main counterpart on the groundnut sector policy
dialogue leading up to the HIPC completion point. Other key government stakeholders, the
Department o f State (Ministry) o f Agriculture and o f Trade and Industry, have played more minor
roles due to relatively weaker institutional capacity. Private operators and the farmers are
considered supportive o f the reforms, as they are expected to benefit from a more stable and
predictable marketing arrangement. Private investors seeking preferential treatment from the
government can potentially undermine the reforms, specifically the divestiture o f GGC. For this
reason, it will be critical to ensure the orderly completion o f the GAMCO liquidation process and
the prevention o f future preferential treatment o f any one investor. Therefore, it will be critical that
the divestiture options be transparently and thoroughly discussed by all major public and private
stakeholders, including private operators, farmers associations and the commercial banks which
provide the crop financing.


                                                  - 34 -

5.61.   Sustained political commitment to the Roadmap would be supported by continued
consultations with the key public and private stakeholders, regular coordination and monitoring o f
the implementation o f the Roadmap through the multi-stakeholder RISC, and the promotion o f
transparency and accountability to the Roadmap's implementation through public disclosures on
progress inimplementing the Roadmap.

5.62.   Government's Policy Matrix Reform Actions for 2008. The continued implementation
o f the Roadmap i s the basis for the groundnut sector reform measures in the Policy Matrix. There
are two reform measures for 2008 and both are supported by the proposed Grant. The Policy
Matrix focuses on the processing and marketing arrangements in the sector, which are considered
the most immediate needs. However, these are not the only critical needs and additional
complementary reforms will be needed to improve the supply o f production inputs and strengthen
producer associations (see Box 5 and previous paragraphs for details). The reforms o f the Policy
Matrix will be complemented by investments inthe rehabilitation of the river transport, depots and
processing facilities, funded by the IDA'SGateway project and the EC. All reform measures for
2008 are prior actions and hence there are no non-prior actions.

5.63.   Future reform measures for 2009 and 2010 include: completion o f the financial and
technical audits o f GGC; public endorsement o f a divestiture strategy; divestiture o f GGC;
improvement o f the producer price determination mechanism; and strengthening of the sector's
quality control system.

5.64.   Expected Results. The reform measures are expected to eventually result in the
revitalization the sector, thus increasing its contribution to economic growth and poverty
reduction. The new F O A will provide the institutional framework for transparent management o f
the groundnut sector by the major stakeholders. The launch of the financial and technical audits
will provide the basis for the eventual divestiture of GGC. These reforms would result in a more
stable and transparent policy environment and a more efficient and effective marketing
arrangement, which are expected to benefit the groundnut farmers who are among the poorest.




  22 These are reform measures inthe government's Policy Matrix which were not selected to be IDA's prior actions.
  The government intends to implement these reforms but they will not specifically determine the release o f IDA's
  proposed Grant.

                               6. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                                        COUNTRYOWNERSHIP

6.1.    The proposed operation i s fully owned by the country. Extensive discussions were held
with key government stakeholders in developing the reform agenda of the operation. The specific
reforms are critical elements of the government's national development strategy as outlined inthe
country's PRSP. The PRSP was the result o f an extensive participatory and consultative process.
Stakeholder workshops and focus group discussions were held with representatives o f the public
and private stakeholders and civil society. Consultation reached down to the level o f communities.
Participatory poverty assessments, community scorecards and "budget games" were utilized in
preparing the strategy. The government's Letter o f Development Policy (Annex 1) outlines
progress inimplementingthe PRSP reform agenda, including the Policy Matrix reform measures.

                                      POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

6.2.    The reform measures supported by the proposed Grant are expected to have a significant
positive direct poverty and social impact. The strengthening o f public financial management i s
expected to improve the government' capacity to more effectively manage its resources and deliver
public services. The improvements o f official statistics will provide the government with better
information for public policy making and targeted public interventions, particularly in the context
o f the PRSP. In addition, an ongoing poverty assessment i s expected to further strengthen the
country's poverty related database and analysis.

6.3.    The proposed Grant supports the first year o f a three-year civil service reform agenda
which i s expected to strengthen public sector capacity to improve service delivery and implement
the country's PRSP. The government's civil service reform strategy focuses on improving the
remuneration package o f civil servants and does not include any plans for retrenchment. Therefore,
the reforms are expected to have a positive impact on civil servants as well as the provision o f
public services. Also, it should be noted that currently the salaries o f the lowest grades inthe civil
service and pensioners receiving the lowest benefits put them below the official poverty line.

6.4.    The proposed Grant focuses on the first year o f a three year program to restructure and
stabilize the processing and marketing o f groundnuts. The groundnut sector reforms have the
potential to eventually significantly impact rural poverty given that rural groundnut farmers are
one o f the poorest groups in the country. The urban poverty rate i s 40 percent compared to 68
percent in rural areas, and groundnut producers have a poverty rate o f 77 percent which is much
higher than the 46 percent o f other households. Groundnut farmers are vulnerable to the erratic
performance o f the sector given that they are quite dependent on the sale o f groundnuts, which
generate on average 60 to 80 percent o f their total revenue from crops. A key objective o f the
ongoing sector reforms i s to provide groundnut farmers with a stable market for their products with
minimumproducerprices. This would improve the predictability o fthe income o ffarmers and thus
lower the level o f their vulnerability.

6.5.    The reforms directly supported by the proposed Grant are expected to eventually have a
significant impact reducing vulnerability among groundnut farmers but they are not the only
critical reforms. The Poverty and Impact Analysis (PSIA) conducted by the IMF in 2007



                                                - 36 -

recommended that the government develop a comprehensive sector-wide reform strategy that
addresses bottlenecks all along the value chain, from production to procurement, transportation,
processing and marketing. It emphasized the need to rebuild agricultural extension services and the
capacities o f farmer cooperatives and strengthen basic infrastructure. The groundnut sector
Roadmap i s consistent with these recommendations. Parts o f the Roadmap would benefit from
further refinement for improved concreteness and additional support from the development
partners. They include improving access to production inputs and credit and strengthening farmers
associations. The government i s currently developing these complementary reform measures in
consultationwith the development partners.23

                                           ENVIRONMENTAL         ASPECTS

6.6.    The specific reforms supported by the proposed development policy operation are not
likely to have significant negative effects on The Gambia's environment. The priority
environmental challenges in the country include deforestation, desertification, and erosion and
salinization o f tidal lands far upriver. The public sector reforms supported by the proposed
operation are unlikelyto significantly exacerbate these problems.

6.7.    Regarding the groundnut sector, the DPO reforms focus on improving the regulatory
framework o f the sector and auditing the government's                          groundnut processing plants.
Environmental degradation resulting from over-exploitation o f resources is unlikely given that
groundnut productions are currently historically low. However, the government will be encouraged
to monitor the potential adverse effects and implement appropriate actions as necessary.
Environmental risks could also potentially result from the overuse o f fertilizers, pesticides and
irrigation water, but these elements are not explicitly included in the reforms supported by the
Grant and currently the use o f these agricultural inputs i s extremely low. Environmentally
sustainable farming methods are part o f the government's extension programs.

6.8.     The main government agencies responsible for environmental management are the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department o f State for Agriculture (DOSA).
The government is contemplating updating its Environmental Action Plan (1994) into a more
comprehensive and integrated strategy based on a long term and coordinated approach. The
institutional environment could benefit from further strengthening, with improved cross-sectoral
coordination andparticipation and greater provision o fpublic information.

                            IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORINGEVALUATION     AND

6.9.     The existing institutional structure for the PRSP process will be used to implement and
monitor the policy reforms supported by the proposed Grant. A Cabinet subcommittee, the High
Level Economic Committee (HILEC), will provide overall guidance for the budget support
program. DOSFEA and the NPC will assume overall responsibility for coordinating the
implementation, monitoring and evaluation o f the Policy Matrix. They will be ultimately
responsible for reporting progress and coordinating actions among other concerned Departments o f
State and agencies. The Policy Matrix in Annex 2 identifies government agencies responsible for

each policy reform andbenchmark outcome indicators. Annex 3 details the subset o f Policy Matrix
reforms supported by the proposed Grant and the related outcome indicators.

6.10.   The government and the development partners providing budget support will jointly
conduct annual reviews o f the implementation o f the Policy Matrix. These reviews will be used to
monitor reform actions, evaluate the impact o f the reforms on the development objectives, and
discuss strategic adjustments to the Policy Matrix taking into account the latest country
developments, stakeholder support and alternative options for realizing the intended development
objectives. The reviews will be based on the reform measures and outcome indicators outlined in
the Policy Matrix. Even after the disbursement o f its single tranche, IDA plans to continue
participating inthe annual reviews inorder to coordinate support to the government and participate
inthe policy dialogue.

                                                   FIDUCIARYASPECTS

6.11. Fiduciary aspects, particularly the strengthening o f the government's own systems, are at
the core o f this operation. Inparticular, PFM and procurement reforms are incorporated in the
government's Policy Matrix. The PFM reform measures are drawn from the ongoing 2008 CFAA,
which indicates that PFM has substantially improved since the previous CFAA in 2003. The
procurement reforms are based on the 2005 CPP.24 The measures complement the support
provided by various donor funded capacity building projects. Overall, the Bank has judged
satisfactory the implementation performance o f the PFM reform program and the government's
commitment to its continued improvement.

6.12.   A formal IMF Safeguards Assessment o f the Central Bank o f the Gambia (CBG) was
carried out in 2004 and an update was conducted in 2006. The assessments indicated that notable
progress had been made in strengthening accounting controls but vulnerabilities remained in
controls over international reserves and procedures for extending credit to the government. In
response, important steps have been taken to strengthen internal controls, in line with the
recommendations o f the Safeguards Assessment and external audits o f CBG's accounts: (i)             semi-
annual audits o f monetary program data; (ii)           implementation o f the segregation o f duties in the
management o f reserves, including formal guidelines for foreign exchange reserves management;
(iii)establishment o f an audit committee, comprising the independent members o f the Board, to
oversee the external, audit process and the internal control structure; and (iv) new operating
manuals for the internal audit, finance, and foreign exchange departments. A new Central Bank
Act (2005) provides increased operational independence o f the CBG and sets limits on lendingto
the government. The capacity o f internal audits and supervision departments was strengthened
through new recruits and training.

                                                                AND

6.13.   A single tranche Grant o f SDR 4.5 million (US$7 million equivalent) would be made
available to the Republic o f The Gambia upon grant effectiveness. The closing date o f the
operation would be December 31,2009.

6.14.    The Grant will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for development policy
operations. Once the Grant becomes effective, the government o f The Gambia will submit a
withdrawal application to IDA requesting that the proceeds o f the Grant be deposited in the CBG
into a separate dedicated account that forms part o f the country's official foreign exchange
reserves. Within five working days upon the deposit o f the Grant into said account, the Borrower
shall ensure an equivalent amount i s credited in the Borrower's budget management system, in a
manner acceptable to the Bank and to finance management expenditures, and the Borrower will
also report to the Bank on the amounts deposited in the foreign currency account and credited to
the budget management system. Disbursement would not be linked to specific purchases. When
the funds are disbursed from the dedicated account inorder to finance government expenditures,
the official exchange rate for that day will be used. If the proceeds o f the Grant are used for
ineligible purposes as defined in the Financing Agreement, IDA will require the Recipient to
refund an amount equal to the amount of said payment to IDA promptly upon notice from IDA.
Amounts refundedto the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled.

6.15.    As providedinthe Financing Agreement, IDA reserves the right to request an audit o f the
above mentioned separate designated account into which the Grant will be disbursed and o f the
recording o f the transfer o f Grant proceeds inthe government's budget management system.

6.16.    Through the Department o f State for Finance and Economic Affairs, the Borrower will (a)
report the exact sum received into the deposit account; (b) ensure that all withdrawals from the
deposit account are for budgeted public expenditures, except for those items on IDA'Snegative
list; (c) provide to IDA evidence that the dalasi equivalent o f the Grant proceeds were credited to
the consolidated fund account and disbursements from that account were for budgeted public
expenditures. It i s expected that the National Audit Office will provide IDA with its annual report
on the public accounts to the National Assembly by the end o f the year following the execution o f
the budget.

                                        R I S K S AND RISK MITIGATION

6.17.    There are relatively significant risks to the proposed operation, although risk mitigating
strategies have been identified:

6.18.    CapacityConstraintsof the Government.Public sector capacity constraints are typical in
a small, poor country such as The Gambia. Such constraints are a major challenge to successful
implementation o f the reform program. The proposed operation seeks to mitigate this risk in
several ways: first, the proposed operation focuses on only a limited number o f policy areas and
reform measures; second, it emphasizes building on ongoing initiatives as opposed to introducing
new ones; and third, actions to support public sector capacity building themselves are a major
objective o f the operation. The recent track record with PFM reforms indicate that progress on
capacity building is possible but requires a long term engagement and sustained political
commitment.

6.19.    MacroeconomicSlippages and Exogenous Shocks. Sustained government commitment
to maintaining fiscal and monetary discipline will be critical for the sustainability of the planned
reforms. The recent track record indicates that commitments will be sustained. The primary fiscal
balance has consistently been in significant surplus and money supply growth has been moderate,



                                                    - 39 -

resulting in robust growth and low inflation. In order to reduce the risk o f debt distress, the
government has steadily reduceddomestic borrowing and set limits to the volume and a minimum
level o f concessionality for new external borrowing.

6.20.   Recent turmoil in the international financial markets and the global economic slowdown
could potentially pose serious challenges to The Gambia giventhat the country depends heavily on
trade, tourism and remittances. Close monitoring of the developing situation and quick remedial
actions will be critical. The government continues to discuss the macroeconomic implications with
the IMF as part of the PRGF-supported program and the structural reforms with the World Bank,
AfDB, EC and other development partners. Inparticular, the proposed budget support provides a
common forum to discuss the necessary reforms o f the public sector and the groundnut sector
which will strengthen the country's core economic base and improve its ability to withstand
external shocks. The government i s also discussing with the various donors on the possible need
for augmented external aid.

6.21.   Weak Governance.The country could further enhance the transparency and accountability
o f the public sector. Wide consultations on the Policy Matrix, and the PRSP from which it i s
derived, have been used to build country ownership and mitigate the governance risk. The civil
service reform strategy was developed from a broad survey o f civil servants and a multi-
stakeholder Cabinet subcommittee i s overseeing its implementation. Both public and private
stakeholders, including farmer associations and private operators, were consulted in the
development o f the groundnut sector reform Roadmap and participate in its implementation and
overall management o f the sector. Development partners have been providing capacity building
support to the National Audit Office (Auditor General) and the National Assembly. Finally,
support and participation of the donors in the implementation o f the Policy Matrix, particularly
through frank and open policy dialogue, contribute towards building political commitment to
reforms.

6.22.   Lack of SustainedCommitmentto Groundnut Sector Reforms: Givenpolicy reversals
in the past, there remains a risk that commitment to reforms o f the groundnut sector will waver.
This risk is mitigatedby a transparent and publicly disseminated sector reform Roadmap andwide
consultations on the Roadmap with key government and non-governmental stakeholders, including
farmer associations, private operators ahd the development partners. The dismantling o f GAMCO,
the public-private joint venture which had previously monopolized the marketing o f groundnuts,
indicates serious political commitment to the reforms. Based on the dialogue with the government,
there appears to be a genuine consensus that the policy missteps in the past need to be avoided.
Continued consultations with public andprivate stakeholders will be critical.

6.23.   Inaddition to the reforms directly supported by the proposed Grant, a fullrevitalization of
the groundnut sector would benefit from complementary reforms on: improving access to
agricultural production inputs, such as fertilizers, seeds and crop financing; expanding irrigation;
strengthening farmer support institutions, in particular producer associations; and building
government capacity in agricultural policy-making and research and extension services. These
reforms are receiving some support from donor projects and the government i s discussing with the
development partnerson the'possibility of additional donor assistance.

Growth has been strong but we expect a slow down In 2008 and ttae near future due to
ttie impad of the inaeaseof importprices and the globaleconomic slowdown. RealGDP
grew at 6.5 percent In 2006 and 6,3 percentin 2007 but we expect growth ta d
about 6 percent in 2M8. DependingOR how the current global cFisis unfolds, the annual
growth ratesfor 2009 bo 2010 could be W e e n 4.5 and S perant. Growth continues to

Growth in the agricul5uFe sa?cbr malns relatively Im and actualty declined in 2007.
Agriculture continuestxz largely depend on subsistence Farming with substantialexposure
to exagemus shocks. Infact, low rainfalls in 2003 resulted in a decline in the production
lev& by one-third to me-half. Wjth many of the poor still dependent on agriculture,
particularly groundnut farmlng, it will be critical to improve the production, productivity
and valueadded activities in tlse sector while also transforming the economy towards
potentially higher growthsectors,
Given that we are a small country dependent on imports, we are relatively exposed to
external shocks. Due to rising world food prices, the annual rate of inflatlon rase on a
year-on-year basis ffom iess than 1percent in December2#06 to 6-7 percent fw pa* of
2007. The appreciation of the lml currency, dalasi, and retatlvdy tight mnetary poiicy

expenditures excluding Interest payments, the budget outturn for pverty-reducing
expenditures Increased from 358 percent In 2006 ta 42.8 percent In 2007 and 54.2
penent in 2008, based on preliminary estimates, We plan to rcrntlnue to increase this
shareas well as the shares of expenditures for education, healthandagriculture,

In addition tu macracconornic stability, piliar one emphasizes public sector reforms. Our
main objective is to continue the significant structural ~fQrm5carriedaut in recent years
of governmentinstitutions, operationsand procedures. In recent years, we have created
the folbwing new instltutians: Gambia Revenue Aukhority (GRA); Gambia Bureau of
Statistics (GSOS); National Road Authority (NRA); National Agricultural Development
Agency (NADA); and the Central Project Management and AId Coordination Dlrecbrate
under DOSFEA, These relatively new institutions will need to be continued fo be
strengthenrrd in order to ensure thdr sustainability and their impact on improving
government operations.

The government took major steps to improve public expenditure management by
devebping a Integrated Ftnanciat Management Information System (IFME). The system
began operating in 2007 and currently processes all central government transactions. It
produces fiscal and povtlrty-rducingreports in a timely manner and prepared the 2007
government publicxcounts in the thitd quarter of 2008. This is a vast improvementfrom
me backtog in
previous years when there were several ycaw of delay in producingthe public accounts,
                  preparing the public accounts has now been allminated and we are
focusjng on reducing and eentuaEly eliminatingthe backlog ifl the audits of the public
aacounts.

The reform of the national statistical system is a government priority. We betieve that
improving the refiabillty and timeliness of data is critical to enhanced government
decision-rnalcing, targeting of gavernmentinterventionsand monltorlng of PRSP and MDG
implementation. The major refoms have been the restructuringof the previous Central
StaWia Department (ED) into GBOS, a semiautonomous statisWaf agency, and the
establishment of the StatisticsCouncil which acts as the Boardfor GBOS.

GRA, GBOS and IFMZS were established through support from a Wodd Bank project, the
bpacity Building for Economic Management Project [CBEMP). Thls project dose,! In
December 2008. However, it is critical that we continue to support the= three initiatives
in order to ensure their sustainability. With ~ ~ p e to tIFMZS, the government has

The newiy created institutionswill be effective only if we are able to wuit, retain and
properly motivate and manage the performance af qualified personnel. In order to
achieve this objective, the government is embarking on a comprehensive dvlt service
reform program. Together with the World Bank, AR3B and DFID, we have anafyzed the
key ccrmstmints of the civil service through the report The Gambia Improving Civif

andActing Chair, said:


"The Gambian authorities are to be commended for the satisfactory implementation o ftheir
PRGF-supportedprogram and their commitment to prudent economic policies, which have
contributedto robust growth and moderate inflation. Nevertheless, The Gambia has not been
spared from the effects o f the global economic crisis, with international reserves declining

"The authorities remain committed to achieving sustained growth andpoverty reductionby
maintaining fiscal discipline, reducing the still highdebt level, andpromoting private sector
development. The authorities will increase the share o fbudgetary resources allocated to
poverty reduction, inline with the priorities'oftheir poverty reduction strategy, and inorder
to make faster progress toward achieving the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs).The
authorities intendto review the system o f investment incentives to improve the climate for
private investment while maintaining fiscal prudence.


"Fiscal policy is beingstrengthened to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability. The authorities
have appropriately scaled back their expenditure plans to partially compensate for the
contraction o frevenues. They have also maintained the retail prices o fpetroleum products at
current levels to allow for some recovery ingovernment revenues. Going forward, it will be
important to improve the revenue base, rationalize taxation, better align the budgetwith
PRSP priorities, and further strengthen public financial management.


"The commitment o f the Central Bank o f the Gambia (CBG) to maintain a monetarypolicy
designed to keep inflation at single-digit levels i s commendable. The authorities are
appropriately planning to rebuild international reserves inorder to provide a stronger buffer
against adverse external developments, and the augmentation o f access under the PRGF
arrangement will provide helpful support inthis regard.


"The Gambia remains at highrisk o f debt distress, even after receiving HIPC and MDRIdebt
relief, due to highlevels o f debt inrelation to exports and vulnerability to external shocks. It
i s important to expedite the formulation o f a national debt strategy to guide government
borrowing decisions and ensure long-term sustainability. As much as possible, there should
bereliance on grants to finance the country's development programs," Mr.Portugal said.

The PRGF i s the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF-supported
programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted ina participatory
process involving civil society and development partners and articulated inthe country's
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. This i s intended to ensure that PRGF-supportedprograms
are consistent with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural, and social
policies to foster growth and reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate o f 0.5
percent and are repayable over 10 years with a 5% -year grace period on principal payments.
