1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design


1.1 Context at Appraisal


Country Profile and Macroeconomic Performance

1.      The Gambia is small African country with a relatively high rate of poverty and
low human development index (Table 1) that has experienced strong economic growth
despite the global economic downturn and has maintained macroeconomic stability.
When the Bank appraised the Development Policy Grant (DPG) for the Public Sector
Reform and Growth Grant (the DPG) in Table 1: Basic Indicators
late 2008/early 2009, the service sector Population                          1.7 million
was the main driver of economic growth GDP Per Capita                        USD 400 (atlas
with agriculture as the main source of                                       method)
livelihood for most people. Groundnuts           Ranking: Human              155 out of 177

agricultural crop. They absorbed about 40 Composition of GDP (2007)

accounted for 60 percent of domestic --Industry                              15
exports. An estimated 80 percent of the --Services                           56
                                                 Total                       100
population was engaged in some aspect of
groundnut production or marketing with nearly 70 percent of households working in
groundnut production classified as poor. The Gambia's main development challenges
were to: increase growth and innovation in tourism; encourage private sector-led
diversification in agricultural exports; revitalize the groundnut subsector and improve the
operation of key infrastructure, especially in the transport and energy sectors, to support
planned economic developments.

2.      The Gambia's economy had been growing at an average annual rate of around six
percent for several years prior to the DPG's approval. The Government of the Gambia
(the Government) had been successful in containing inflation and improving the fiscal
balance. Inflation had declined from a high of 17 percent in 2002 to 2.1 percent in 2006
as a result of greater fiscal discipline and lower domestic borrowing. It had risen again in
2007, to 5.4 percent, primarily due to the higher costs of imported foodstuffs and fuel on
the global market. The Government had responded by reducing the sales tax on rice
imports from 15 percent to five percent in July 2007 and eliminating it altogether in May
2008. These measures, combined with tight monetary policies, had been successful in
containing a further rise in inflation, which actually dropped slightly to 4.5 percent in
2008 and 2.7 percent by end-2009.

3.     The total fiscal balance (including payments on debt service obligations), as a
share of GDP, had improved from a deficit equivalent to about 7.6 percent in 2002 to a
surplus equivalent to 0.4 percent in 2007. The primary fiscal balance, a better measure of
discretionary fiscal policy1 had averaged a surplus of 7.5 percent during the period 2003-
2007. The country's performance in revenue collection had been strong, averaging the
equivalent of 20.2 percent of GDP during 2004-2007. The external financing of the
economy, including both grants and loans, as a share of GDP, was relatively high at 4.8
percent of GDP in 2007 but less than half of what it was in 2004 (12.6 percent).

4.      Improvements in macroeconomic policy had resulted in the IMF's re-engagement
with The Gambia through a new Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF)-supported
program, which began in 2007. The previous program, covering 2002-05, had stalled due
to off-budget expenditures and mismanagement of Central Bank foreign exchange
transactions. Improvements in governance and macroeconomic policy had resulted in the
approval, by the Boards of the Bank and the IMF, of the Gambia's participation in the
Heavily-Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative, with the country reaching completion
point in December 2007.

5.      To reach the HIPC completion point, the Gambia had met a number of triggers
aimed at maintaining macroeconomic stability, ensuring commitment to the national
poverty strategy, strengthening public expenditure management, improving the poverty
database and monitoring capacity, raising the quality and coverage of education,
improving health outcomes, and promoting development of the private sector. In
addition, the Government had taken steps to revitalize the groundnut sector through
liberalization reforms. As result of reaching HIPC completion point, the Gambia became
eligible to receive the equivalent of US$514 million in nominal debt relief under both the
Enhanced HIPC Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), on
principal as well as interest payments. However, even with the combined debt relief, the
Gambia's external debt remained quite large, equivalent to about 46 percent of GDP. It is
estimated that the debt relief resulting from reaching the HIPC completion point
combined with the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) has freed development
resources equivalent to about 2.5 percent of GDP.

Poverty Reduction Strategy

6.    The Government has prepared its second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP), covering the period 2007-2011. This strategy consisted of five pillars:
           Pillar 1: Create an enabling policy environment to promote growth and poverty
           Reduction.
           Pillar 2: Enhance the capacity and output of productive sectors: agriculture,
           fisheries, industry, trade and tourism, with emphasis on productive capacities of
           the poor and vulnerable populations.
           Pillar 3: Improve coverage of the basic social services and social protection needs
           of the poor and vulnerable.

    It measures the difference between government revenues and expenditures, before interest payments and external
grants.



                                                         7
         Pillar 4: Enhance governance systems and build the capacity of local communities
         and civil society organization to play an active role in economic growth and
         poverty reduction.
         Pillar 5: Focus multi-sectoral programs on improving gender, the environment
         and population.

7.     The development of the second PRSP resulted from a participatory and
consultative process that included a wide array of stakeholders from the highest level of
government to local communities. The estimated total cost of the five-year program is
about US$ 754 million, with the Government able to contribute about US$ 100.5 million
based on its revenue projections. Donor commitments amounted to about US$ 174
million, leaving a financing gap of US$ 479.9 million. Taking into account HIPC
resources amounting to about US$ 170 million over five years, the total financing gap for
the second PRSP investment is about US$ 310 for the entire PRSP period or US$ 62
million annually.

8.     The DPG, in its policy actions for improved use of public resources, supported the
public sector reform program of Pillar 1 and in its actions for the reform and the
commercialization of the groundnut sector, supported Pillar 2, which focuses on
improving the performance of the productive sectors.

Governance

9.      At the time of the appraisal of the policy actions supported by this single-tranche
Development Policy Operation (DPO), cross-country governance indicators ranked The
Gambia better than average on political stability, regulatory quality, and rule of law but
lower than average on government effectiveness, voice and accountability2, and control
of corruption. A study by Transparency International in 2007 had ranked the Gambia, in
121 out of 163 countries in transparency of government.3

Donor Assistance Framework

10.     The DPO consisted of a subset of policy actions and related performance
indicators in the Government's Joint General Budget Support Policy Matrix (the Joint
Policy Matrix), which sequentially outlines priority PRSP reform measures and
quantitative outcome indicators for the period 2008-10. The African Development Bank
(AfDB), the European Commission (EC) and the World Bank had agreed to use this
matrix as the framework for their budget support. The Joint Policy Matrix resulted from
extensive consultations with key public and private stakeholders and substantial
analytical work. Section 2.1 discusses the detailed policy actions and indicators
applicable to the DPO.

2
  Voice and accountability measure the extent to which a country's citizens are able to participate in selecting their
government and have the freedom of expression and association as well as a free media.
3
  The Gambia's transparency rating has improved since the appraisal of the DPO, ranking 106 out of 180 according to
a 2009 report of Transparency International.

Rationale for Bank Involvement

11.    The main reasons for granting the Government's request for budget support were:
the Government's establishment of a coherent policy program, the PRSP; an adequate
macroeconomic framework; sufficient institutional capacity to manage the operation; and
the consistency of an IDA-financed budget support operation with the objective of
funding poverty reduction programs while containing debt through the use of grant funds.
Futhermore, the decision by three of the major development partners, IDA, AfDB and
EC, to coordinate budget support also provides a significant opportunity to improve
donor coordination, minimize the burden on the government's limited capacity, and allow
each donor to be engaged in a range of critical policy reforms despite limited resources.

12.     This policy area focused on reforms of revenue administration, budget execution,
and the publication of official statistics. The establishment of the Gambia Revenue
Authority (GRA) in 2004 had helped considerably to enhance the legitimacy and
professionalism of tax administration, improve taxpayer services and promote the
uniform application of tax laws. Improved revenue administration had resulted in average
domestic tax revenue of 21 percent of GDP, one of the highest rates in the Africa region.
However the GRA faced a number of challenges, including the rationalization of central
and local government taxes, the strengthening of external and internal audits and the
reduction of discretionary approvals of duty exemptions. The GRA lacked a strategy for
improvement in these areas of operations. The policy actions were to focus on measures
to enhance revenue, providing the fiscal space for PRSP-related expenditures. By
appraisal, the Government had made considerable improvements in its capacity for public
financial management with major reforms to enhance transparency and accountability.
These reforms included: (i) updating the legislative framework for budget management
and public procurement; (ii) developing an Integrated Financial Management Information
System (IFMIS); (iii) reducing the backlog of government audited accounts; and (iv)
establishing the Gambia Public Procurement Authority (GPPA). However, the
Government continued to face several important challenges, which the Program
addressed ­ notably ensuring the sustainability of ongoing reforms, as well as initiating
additional and complementary reforms in budget preparation, aid coordination and
internal auditing. The reforms associated with the DPG were to improve resource
allocation, fiscal management and public service delivery. A key element in the program
was ensuring the sustainability of the IFMIS, so as to continue strengthening budget
preparation, execution and monitoring.

13.     Regarding statistics, the Statistics Act of 2005 had provided the legal framework
for the establishment of the Gambia Bureau of Statistics (GBOS), a semi-autonomous
agency designed to strengthen the delivery of statistical outputs. The Government had
adopted a strategic plan for statistics development that called for work programs with
performance targets, the recruitment of new staff, the strengthening of data infrastructure
and improved archiving and dissemination of data. In this context, the Program supported
the production of timely, accurate statistics.

Policy Area 2: Strengthening civil service capacity

14.     The DPG supported the development and initiation of a reform strategy for the
civil service and strengthening of the payroll system. Civil service reform had been part
of the government reform agenda for many years but progress had been slow. A major




                                            10
study5 of the Gambia's civil service had concluded the size of the civil service and the
wage bill were reasonable but staff composition was a problem given substantial losses in
professional and managerial capacity. The report found that a major cause of the
deterioration of the civil service was that salaries and benefits were extremely low, even
by standards for low-income countries. Furthermore, human resource management
focused on civil service position on an incremental basis rather than being strategically
focused. In addition, pension benefits were low and unpredictable, creating weak
incentives for remaining in government jobs and inequities in staff compensation. The
study's recommendations focused on improving civil service salaries and benefits in a
fiscally sustainable manner along with strengthening human resource management and
training. The DPG's policy actions for civil service reform focused on strengthening the
Government's ability to recruit and retain qualified staff, providing them with adequate
incentives and improving the management of their performance.

Policy Area 3: Revitalizing the groundnut sector

15.    In this area, the DPG supported the adoption of a new regulatory framework and
the initiation of the auditing of the Gambia Groundnut Corporation (GGC), the
government owned entity in charge of groundnut processing and marketing, in
preparation of its eventual divestiture.

16.    The GGC is the major buyer and exporter of groundnuts and its efficient
operation is crucial to the performance of the sector. The GGC was privatized in the
early 1990s but re-nationalized in the early 2000s. Subsequently, the management of the
sector was restructured based on a new regulatory framework, the Framework of
Agreement (FOA), agreed between the government and the sector operators. However,
the Government circumvented this arrangement in 2004 by introducing a new licensing
scheme that awarded a monopoly license to the Gambia Agricultural Marketing
Organization (GAMCO), a new, public-private joint venture. When GAMCO was unable
to absorb the harvest, official exports collapsed from US$17 million in 2004 to US$2
million in 2005.6 Subsequently the Government opened the market to multiple operators.
GAMCO has gone into liquidation proceedings following the Government's takeover of
the company's substantial debt to the commercial banks.

17.     Erratic government policies and the poor performance of GGC had undermined
the capacity of the sector to support the groundnut farmers. The uncertainty regarding
timely cash purchases by GGC had frequently resulted in farmers selling their groundnuts
in informal markets in Senegal at a heavy discount compared to the official producer
price. Furthermore, underinvestment in the sector's infrastructure had resulted in
inefficient transportation and processing of groundnuts, which in turn had constrained
producer prices.


5
  The findings are outlined in the 2008 report "The Gambia Improving Civil Service Performance" and a
complementary report "The Gambia Public Service Pensions Policy Reform Note" which focused on the
government pension system.

  Some of the groundnut harvest is believed to have been sold in Senegal through informal channels.

                                                 11
18.     One of the triggers for the HIPC completion point was the privatization of GGC.
The Government had made efforts at privatization, having advertized the privatization but
then being unsuccessful in finding a sufficiently qualified bidder. Although the
Government did not achieve the trigger on the privatization of GGC, the Boards of the
IDA and the IMF approved the HIPC completion point based on the progress made in
implementing the Government's Groundnut Subsector Roadmap Implementation
Framework. This framework included: (i) allowing immediate free entry of operators at
all levels of the value chain; (ii) transferring management responsibility of the sector to
the Agribusiness Services and Producers Association (ASPA), an association of the
sector's public and private stakeholders; and (iii) dissolving the Board of Directors of
GGC, which had been intervening in the daily operations of the company. The policy
actions envisioned under the DPG focused on key factors for revitalizing the sector in
order to augment its contribution to economic growth and poverty reduction. These
actions supported the creation of a more stable, transparent policy environment and
marketing arrangements more advantageous groundnut farmers.

1.6 Other significant changes

19.    There were no significant changes in the DPG's design.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Performance under the DPG's policy actions (supported by a table derived from
a policy matrix)
Overview

20.     A mission in January 2009 led by the World Bank and conducted jointly with the
African Development Bank (AfDB) and the European Community (EC) assessed the
Government's progress in completing the required prior actions for the grant, negotiated
the arrangements under the grant, including performance indicators, with the
Government, and discussed the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) designed to
reinforce the partnership of the three organizations in providing budget support during
2009 and 2010.

21.    The evaluation of prior actions included consultations, during a four-day period,
with the agencies responsible for implementation. The Board approved the operation on
May 12, 2009, and the Bank released the IDA Grant of USD 7.0 million to the
Government in support of its budget for Fiscal Year (FY) 2009, on August 19, 2009, as
planned.

22.   The grant amount was equivalent to about 4.8 percent of projected government
expenditures for 2009, estimated at the time of the DPG's appraisal.

23.    The Bank-financed single-tranche DPG was envisioned as the first in a sequence
of operations supporting the actions in the Joint Policy Matrix. The following sections
discuss the policy actions achieved for the tranche release along with Tables 2, 3, and 4 --

                                            12
corresponding the three policy areas of the DPG -- that show the subset of policy actions
taken in 2008 and related performance indicators of the Joint Policy Matrix that the DPG
supported. Section 3.2 references these tables and discusses the achievement of
objectives in terms of the extent to which the DPG met the performance targets for 2009
in each of the policy areas.

Policy Area 1: Improvement in Public Resource Management

24.      The policy actions covered several functional areas to make public resource
management more efficient and transparent: budget evaluation and management, revenue
administration, preparation and auditing of national accounts, and publication of national
statistics.

25.     Budget evaluation and management. The Government had established the
IFMIS under the Bank-funded CBEMP. At the time of the DPG's appraisal the IFMIS
covered about 80 percent of government operations. The policy action for budget
management was ensuring sufficient financing in the budget for 2009 to continue the
operation of IFMIS, including the retention of expert consultants required until
completion of the transfer of capability to local staff. The appraisal mission's review of
prior actions noted that the Government's budget for 2009 included 61 million dalasis
(USD 2.4 million) in support of IFMIS allocated as follows: operating costs of 12 million
dalasis (about USD 0.5 million); training costs of 4 million dalasi (USD 0.15 million);
and consultant costs (for technical assistance) of 45 million dalasis (USD 1.7 million).
The basis of these costs was an IFMIS sustainability plan, prepared initially under the
CBEMP.

26.     Revenue administration. The policy actions for 2008 were the endorsement, by
the Gambia Revenue Authority (GRA), of a strategic plan for the preparation and
dissemination of new operational manuals along with staff training. During the appraisal
of this single-tranche DPG, the Bank took account of the global economic downturn and
recognized that the original indicator of tax revenues as a percentage of GDP was not
entirely within the control of GRA, arriving at a performance indicator over which GRA
would have more control ­the audit of 20 large taxpayers. At the end of 2008, the
Government had specified 270 large taxpayers, consisting of 215 firms and 55
individuals. However, by the end of the DPG in December 2009, GRA had not submitted
any information on this indicator.

27.     The appraisal mission also made several recommendations to improve revenue
management, outside the framework of prior actions for tranche release and performance
indicators. First, it cited, as a top priority, filling the post of the Director of Internal
Audit. Second, the mission recommended updating customs legislation to strengthen the
country's role as a regional trading hub and align the valuation system for duties with
conventions of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Third, the mission recommended
improving GRA's monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system, particularly quantifying the
organization's performance objectives. Fourth, it recommended regular taxpayer surveys
to assess the need for any upgrading of services.

                                            13
28.    Preparation and auditing of national accounts. More timely production of
national accounts was a high-priority action due to major backlogs in submitting audited
government accounts to the National Audit Office (NAO) for approval. As a prior action,
the Government cleared a five-year backlog (for the years 2000 to 2004) in the
submission of audited national accounts to the National Assembly. At the time of the
appraisal mission, NAO was auditing the accounts for 2005-2007. The preparation of the
national accounts has improved in phases. NAO qualified its audit for the accounts
covering the year 2000-2004 stating that they could not form an opinion due to the lack
of supporting documentation. The United Kingdom's Department of International
Development (DFID) assisted the Government in the preparation of national accounts for
2005 and 2006. The accounts for 2007 were the first produced from the Integrated
Financial Management System (IFMIS).

29.    Publication of national statistics. The policy action for 2008, which the
Gambian Bureau of Statistics (GBOS) implemented, was the publication of an economic
census and the national accounts. This action was part of a Strategic Plan for the
Development of Statistics in the Gambia: 2008-2011, which focused on disseminating
timely data of high quality.

Policy Area 2: Strengthening Civil Service Capacity

30.     This single-tranche DPG supported selected policy actions to reform the civil
service to attract and retain adequate professional staff. These selected actions reflected
the Public Sector Reform Strategy Paper, 2007 -2011, which the Cabinet and the Civil
Service Reform Board had adopted. The single-tranche DPG focused on two immediate
prior actions taken by the Government: (i) adoption of a strategy for civil service reform
and (ii) full computerization of the payroll system in the IFMIS, linking human resource
information to pay scales.

Policy Area 3: Revitalizing the groundnut sector through structural reform

31.     The achieved policy actions in 2008 were part of the Government's Groundnut
Subsector Roadmap Implementation Framework. They focused on what the Roadmap
cited as the most immediate needs ­ improved marketing and processing arrangements.
These arrangements consisted of a management agreement between the Government and
the Agribusiness Services and Producers Association (ASPA) and a financial audit of the
government-owned GGC, initial steps toward divestiture.

32.     The associated outcome indicators for 2009 were two quantitative targets
reflecting improved management: (i) the announcement of producer prices on November
15 instead of mid-December and (ii) the commercialization of groundnut crops, from a
baseline of 3,700 in 2007 to at least 20,000 in 2008, amounting to about 80 percent of
total production. The Government advanced the announcement of producer prices, but
fell short of the target, with the announcement happening in early December rather than,
as envisioned, in mid- November. Also, the Government commercialized about 22,000
tons, fully meeting the targe, and actually exceeding it by a small margin, the prior action
under the program supported by this DPG.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

33.      Adequacy of government commitment. The Government demonstrated a
serious commitment to prerequisites for budget support-- maintaining macroeconomic
stability; completing the country's second PRSP, governing the period of the budget
support (2007-2011); performing better in the implementation of the second PRSP
compared to the first PRSP, as seen by a large increase in PRSP-related expenditures
relative to total expenditures; and preparing a detailed Letter of Development Policy that
established a compelling case for budget support.

34.     The PRSP included a detailed action plan with estimated costs, identifying a large
financing gap, amounting to US$ 62 million equivalent per year, or about seven percent
of the Gambia's GDP. In particular, the Letter of Development Policy called attention to
the Government's commitment to incorporating PRSP-related expenditures in the budget,
noting the establishment of a system of codes to identify and track these expenditures.

                                                  17
The Government also cited the increasing share of PRSP expenditures in total
expenditures, noting the budget outturn for these expenditures increasing from 35.8
percent in 2006 to about 54 percent in 2008.

35.     Soundness of background analysis. The design of the policy actions supported
by this single-tranche DPG rested on a foundation of considerable analytical work on the
characteristics of poverty in the Gambia and the performance of the two key sectors
receiving budget support ­public administration and the groundnut sector. The Poverty
Analysis of the Integrated Household Survey, using data from a survey of 2003, revealed
significant geographical, gender and occupational variations in poverty levels. It noted
much higher levels of poverty among groundnut producers than the average for the
country, making the revitalization of the groundnut sector a key factor in poverty
reduction, and therefore an important objective of budget support. The preparation of the
Policy actions benefitted from studies on the roadmap for the privatization process
(2007), quality control system (2006), the Public Expenditure Review Update for the
agricultural sector (2006), and the Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (2007).

36.     In the public administration sector, a series of diagnostic assessments indicated
significant improvements in the capacity for public expenditure management particularly
in the development of the IFMIS. This core element in public sector management had
improved the transparency of expenditures and provided the means to facilitate the
production of national accounts. The analytical work identified the need to ensure
recurrent funding for IFMIS and utilize the system more intensively to reflect PRSP
priorities and improve reporting, while, at the same time, improve budget preparation, aid
coordination and internal auditing.

37.     Assessment of the lessons learned in the design of the DPG. The design of the
DPG reflected lessons learned from past budget support and investment operations
included in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY 2002-20077 and good practice
in designing conditionality:

          First the DPG focused on two sectors with clear strategies and analytical work in
          place. Past experience had shown that without such clarity there was a danger
          that policies envisioned under the DPG would not lead to the expected outcome.

          Second, the DPG reflected the need for adequate resource allocation for the PRSP,
          including quantitative measures to monitor priority investments.            These
          quantitative measures were important because in the previous PRSP, covering
          2005-07, the shares of PRSP-related expenditures in the Government's budget
          were lower than targeted.

                                                    18
         Third, the prior actions for the DPG's single-tranche release placed considerable
         emphasis on measures to improve governance because past deficiencies in budget
         management and the operations of the Central Bank of the Gambia (CBG) had
         stalled the transition to budget support.8 The DPG's design reflected the finding
         that the core of better performance in budget management is the effective
         operation of the IFMIS to enhance transparency and accountability.

38.     The DPG also incorporated improvements to the implementation framework and
the coordination of donors in funding budget operations. First, it took account of limited
management capacity by containing the DPG's coverage to three priority areas for
reform--public administration, civil service and groundnut sector. Second, past
experience had stressed the need for measurable indicators and most of the outcome
indicators had quantitative targets. Third, the design of the DPG recognized the need for
improved donor coordination, with the JAS and the Joint Budget Support Policy Matrix
providing the basis for monitoring and evaluation (M&E).

39.     Relevance of the key risks to development outcome. The Bank and Recipients
identified most of the relevant risks to meeting the development outcome, which were:
capacity constraints in the public sector for implementing and monitoring the policy
actions, external economic shocks and slippages in improvements to macroeconomic
management, weak governance, and the lack of sustained commitment to reforms of the
groundnut sector. The DPG took account of the capacity constraints by limiting the
number of measures in the policy matrix, including as prior actions and selected
indicators that were measurable and achievable.                Regarding macroeconomic
developments, the vulnerability of the global downturn was substantial considering the
dependence of the economy on tourism and remittances. However, the country's record
of improved macroeconomic management and the review process of the IMF's PRGF
framework provided at least a temporary buttress against these adverse shocks. The
broad consultative process in the preparation of the PRSP, the alignment of development
policy with PRSP pillars, and the support of development partners in reinforcing public
sector management capacity -- particularly that of the NAO and National Assembly --
significantly lessened the risk of deficiencies in governance derailing achievements under
this single-tranche DPG. The only risk not clearly identified in the program document
was the risk that other donors might not be able to fully fund their committed to funding
future stages of the program. Although a signed MoU aimed at mitigating this risk, the
document was not a binding legal agreement.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

Design

40.     The DPG had nine outcome indicators, seven in the two policy areas linked to the
strengthening of public resource management -- improvements in public administration
and reform of the civil service -- and two in support of revitalizing the groundnut sector.
Although the Program Document does not attach weights to the indicators or establish
any hierarchy among them, the number of indicators for each objective reflected the
percentages in the sector codes for the operation ­ 78 percent central government
administration and 22 percent agricultural marketing and trade.

41.     The DPG relied on existing institutions to monitor the policy actions in 2008 that
were required for tranche release and for the achievement of the associated outcome
indicators in 2009. The High-Level Economic Committee (HILEC), a sub-committee of
the Cabinet, was to provide overall guidance for the policy actions envisioned under the
implementation of the budget support. However, the Program Document did not specify
the composition of this subcommittee or what the "guidance" would entail. The Ministry
of Finance (MoF) and the National Planning Commission (NPC) were to report on the
policy actions for which they were responsible as well as those of other entities
designated in the policy matrix--the Gambia Bureau of Statistics, Gambia Revenue
Authority (GRA), the National Audit Office (NAO), the Personnel Management Office
(PMO) of the Office of the President. . However, there was no delineation in the
allocation of responsibilities between MoF and NPC, what the reports would contain or
when they would be prepared

42.     The Government and the development partners expected to provide budget
support (AfDB and EC, in addition to IDA) were to jointly conduct annual reviews of the
implementation of the Policy Matrix. These reviews were to monitor reform actions,
evaluate the impact of the reforms on the development objectives, and discuss strategic
adjustments to the Policy Matrix taking into account the latest country developments,
stakeholder support and alternative options for realizing the intended development
objectives. After the completion of the prior actions for the DPG, IDA was to continue
participating in the annual reviews to coordinate support to the government and
participate in the policy dialogue.

43.    MoF and the NPC were to assume overall responsibility for coordinating the
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the Policy Matrix with the "ultimate
responsibility" for progress reporting and coordination of other government agencies
responsible for specific actions in the Policy Matrix

Implementation and Utilization

44.    A Bank mission in January 2009 evaluated the execution of the prior actions
required for the negotiations of the DPG and discussed the design of the indicators of the
policy objectives. The mission found that the Government had achieved all of the policy

                                            20
actions with only minor shortcomings. A mission visited the Gambia in July 2009 but
did not prepare an aide memoire or an implementation status report. The country
economist prepared an Implementation Status and Results Report (ISR) in December
2009, which rated the performance as "moderately satisfactory" due to shortcomings in
the attainment of outcome indicators. There was no documentation available on any joint
donor annual review subsequent to the aide memoire of the appraisal mission. For the
preparation of the ICRR, there was no documentation available on monitoring from
DOSFEA, HILEC, or NPA. The Bank's Country Economist for the Gambia prepared the
matrix reflecting the status of the policy actions at end-2009 based primarily on
interviews and budget documents provided by the Government.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

45.    The DPG was the Bank's contribution to budget support through joint partnership
with the AfDB and the EC outlined in a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in
December 2009. According to the MoU, the AfDB and the EC are to provide
complementary budget support covering the period 2008-2012.

46.     The AfDB's assistance consists of a grant of US$ 6.16 million equivalent during
2008-2010. This operation complements support of the Bank-financed program for
improving budgetary processes and enhancing civil service capacity. The triggers for
grant disbursement were: (i) submission, to the National Assembly, of a 2009 budget
aligned with PRSP priorities as well as the audited national accounts for 2005 and 2006
and (ii) the design of a new training policy focused on local programs and the initiation of
the policy's implementation.

47.     At the time of the Program's appraisal, the EC had indicated its intention to
provide budget support amounting to Euro 22 million (US$ 27.1 million equivalent) over
the period 2010-2012, or about US$ 9 million equivalent annually. The EC was to select
prior actions and benchmarks for its support from the Joint Policy Matrix. However, in
May 2010, the EC was still pondering whether to remain engaged in the budget support
arrangement. 9


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

48.     The objectives, design and implementation framework for the DPG remain highly
relevant. Poverty reduction continues to be a major concern of the Government and the
objectives of the PRSP are the high-level objectives for all development programs in the

9
  According to the text of the MoU, either individual development partners or the Government may
withdraw from the Partnership Framework by notifying the other signatories in writing. In such
circumstances, the concerned party would endeavor to provide as much notice of termination as possible
and to take into consideration the ongoing commitments already made to avoid, as much as possible,
unpredictability of budget support/donor aid flows.

                                                 21
Gambia, at least through 2010. The Gambia depends on international donor support for
about 80 percent of its investment program for development.10 The JAS represents the
first step toward the harmonization of aid coordination in the Gambia and serves as a
model for cooperation among the three development partners providing budget support to
the country.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

49.     The DPG's two development objectives ­ strengthening the Government's
capacity to manage public resources and improving the performance of the groundnut
sector- were broad, requiring measurable performance indicators for specificity in
evaluating the extent to which the program met the objectives. Tables 2, 3 and 4 in
Section 2.1 (Performance under the DPG's Performance Indicators) show the
performance indicators and their linkage to associated benchmark indicators allocated
among the three policy areas of focus of the DPG. The DPG fully met four of the nine
performance indicators and made substantial progress toward achieving four others. It
fell short however of one expected targets. The ICRR could not evaluate the achievement
of this one indicator due to a lack of information for assessment. The following sections
outline the achievements by policy area.

50.     Of the nine outcome indicators, seven were in the two policy areas linked to the
strengthening of public resource management--improvements in public administration
and reform of the civil service. The other two supported the revitalization of the
groundnut sector. Although the Program Document does not attach weights to the
indicators or establish any hierarchy among them, the number of indicators for each
objective reflects the percentages in the sector codes for the operation ­ 78 percent
central government administration and 22 percent agricultural marketing and trade.

51.      There was a consistent linkage between the policy actions and the outcome
indicators (See tables 2, 3, and 4). Nearly all of the indicators were quantifiable targets to
test if the policy action taken has been effective in advancing either better management of
public resources or improved performance of the groundnut sector.

52.     Of the five performance indicators related to improvements in public
administration, against which the Government's performance in 2009 was to be
measured once it meet the prior actions for the disbursement under this DPG, the
Government was able to kept two on track. MOF kept staff vacancies below 20 percent
of total staff requirements and NAO was able to eliminate the backlog of audited
accounts for submission to the National Assembly, surpassing the target reduction of the
backlog to two years, compared to a baseline backlog of seven years. In two areas the
program supported by the DPG made significant improvements compared to baseline
indicators but fell short of the targets. MOF reduced the time to prepare national
accounts from one year to nine months or less instead of the target of six-months or less.
And compared to a baseline of no publications of national accounts available, GBOS

made progress with annual publication and a two-year lag time. However this
achievement fell short of the target, which was biannual publication with a two-quarter
lag time. Finally, GRA had one target indicator, the completed audits of 20 of the
Gambia's largest taxpayers. As indicated in Section 2.1, the ICRR could not evaluate the
achievement of this indicator due to a lack of documentation.

53.     There were two indicators of civil service reform geared to increasing staff skills
and improving incentives for a career in public service. One indicator was the increase in
the share of local training in the total training budget, which is less costly than foreign
training with participants more likely to remain in their jobs after the completion of the
training. From a baseline of only nine percent of the training budget in 2007, the share of
local training increased to 26 percent exceeding the target of 20 percent. The other
indicator was the expansion of the IFMIS to cover the payroll of all government staff,
from a baseline of about 80 percent in 2007. Toward the end of the review period, the
expansion of IFMIS came very close to the target, covering about 98 percent of the
Government's payroll.

54.     The Government's actions supported by this DPG contributed to the revitalization
of the groundnut sector, expanding commercialized crops from only 3,700 tons in 2007 to
about 22,000 in 2009 -- exceeding the minimum target set at appraisal. It also resulted in
the earlier announcement of the producer price of groundnuts, providing farmers the
opportunity to sell their harvest earlier in the marketing season. The baseline time for
setting the price was in mid-December. The joint GGC-ASPA announcement of the price
was made in early December, which was an improvement but later than the target date.

55.     Overall achievement. Based on the evaluation of all the indicators, the ICRR
finds that the Program met its objectives with moderate shortcomings, considering that it
did not fully meet nearly half of the indicators set at appraisal.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The DPG has a high degree of relevance to the Government's strategy for poverty
reduction, supporting a program of budget support that is ongoing. Also, the Program
made significant advances in improving the efficiency and transparency of public
administration and the commercialization of the groundnut sector. Nevertheless, the
moderately satisfactory achievement of objectives noted above precludes a fully
satisfactory rating of outcome. Therefore ICRR has rated the outcome as" moderately
satisfactory."

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)




                                            23
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

56.     The Government has made significant progress incorporating PRSP expenditures
in the budget (Table 5). Indicators of this progress were part of the Joint Policy Matrix
but not among the prior policy actions for the DPG. Actual budget allocations for all
sectors .as a share of total local government funds, increased from a baseline of about 45
percent in 2007 to around 54 percent in both 2008 and 2009. However, performance
varied by sector. PRSP-related allocations for the agriculture sector expenditures were
slightly higher than the targets for 2008 and 2009. Those for the education sector
actually declined slightly as a share of the sector's total allocations in both years. In the
health sector, the share of PRSP-related allocations in the sectors' total budget allocations
was lower than the target for 2008 but slightly higher than the target for 2009. The Bank
has recommended linking the preparation process for annual progress reports on the
implementation of the PRSP to the budget process to facilitate the incorporation of PRSP
priorities in the annual budget.

57.    Bank review of the Program Document cited gender differences in poverty levels
and recommended some kind of accounting for this in the Program. However, the final
document did not have a particular focus on gender concerns.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

58.     The entire focus of the actions supported by the DPG was on institutional
strengthening for better use of public sector resources and more productive groundnut
sector. These actions formed part of a long-term strategy that includes both investment
programs and budget support operations. For instance, GRA now has a strategic
development program over a three-year period, including new operational manuals and
extensive staff training. GBOS has improved its performance in publishing statistics from
ad hoc, infrequent publications in the past to annual publication of national accounts,

                                                    24
though with some backlog. The Treasury has submitted the Government's 2007 accounts
to NAO and has reduced the delay in submission of accounts by about three months. The
NAO has eliminated the backlog in the submission of audited accounts to the National
Assembly. The strategy that the Cabinet has adopted for civil service reform should help
improve the performance of these institutions by providing compensation to attract and
retain qualified staff in government service. These improvements in public sector
management should provide enhance donor confidence in providing budget support and
concessional financing for development investments, which are key elements in the
Government's strategy to invest in programs to reduce poverty but not substantially
increase debt payments.

59.     The policy actions supported by the DPG to launch the audit of the GGC will
provide a transparent institutional assessment on which to base the corporation's
divestiture from the Government and the management services agreement with ASRA
will allow the key stakeholders in the groundnut sector direct participation in the sector's
management.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

60.    There were no significant unintended outcomes.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

61.   A beneficiary survey and stakeholder workshops were not applicable to this
ICRR.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
   Rating: Moderate

62.     The risk to the development outcomes of the DPG is moderate. During the
internal review process of this DPG, OPCS called attention to the "quasi-programmatic"
nature of the operation because it was part a program of policy actions spanning two
years (2009 and 2010). In addition, the EC had indicated plans to extend its support
beyond the original 2009-10 horizon, extending the support through 2012. In this
context, the EC signed an agreement to provide budget support for 2010 but has recently
indicated that this support may not be forthcoming. Although this change has no direct
impact on the DPG's outcome, as a single tranche operation, it does raise concerns about
the sustainability of the broader program that the DPG has supported given that the EC's
planned contribution is equivalent to about 14 percent of the annual funding gap PRS.

63.    In evaluating the risk to development outcome, the ICRR guidelines indicate the
need to take account of the operating environment in addition to the risks specific to the
operation, including the nature of the change and the adaptability of Government.
Despite some uncertainty surrounding the future funding for budget support, IDA's
continued involvement in the sector should help to mitigate the risks to the overall
outcome of the program of budget support. IDA has also indicated continued

                                            25
engagement in policy dialogue following completion of the DPG. Finally, the
Association is participating in a joint AfDB-IDA assistance strategy for the Gambia
through 2011. In this context, IDA will design its assistance program based on the funds
available from other donors, including the EC.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
   Rating: Satisfactory

64.     The DPG's design was subject to a substantial review process that overall found
the operation very well-prepared with considerable analytical support, as Section 2.2
discusses in detail. The program objectives were broad, to allow flexibility in
implementation, but clearly linked to PRSP priorities with quantitative indicators
providing the specificity for performance evaluation. There were some minor
shortcomings, however, mainly recommendations made during the review process not
fully incorporated in the final design of the program. Perhaps the most significant
substantive recommendation was to include an additional indicator for the development
of IFMIS--a target share of donor financing to capture in the overall budget as a
preliminary step to eventually integrating both domestic and external financing.11

65.     The program document also incorporated the best practices in the design of the
implementation framework and the coordination of donors in funding budget operations.
It included measurable, time-bound indicators, with most of the outcome indicators
having quantitative targets. It took account of limited management capacity by focusing
the Program's coverage on three priority areas for reform--public administration, civil
service and the groundnut sector. It recognized the need for improved donor
coordination, evidenced Joint Assistance Strategy (JAS) for the programs of the AfDB
and the Bank and the Joint Budget Support Policy Matrix for monitoring and evaluation
(M&E) adopted by the AfDB, the European Commission and the Bank.

(b) Quality of Supervision
    Rating: Satisfactory

   The review process also made good recommendations on general terminology aimed at enhancing the clarity of
Program Document. One was the reference to "other actions," or as they appear in the final report, "non-prior actions"
following the discussion of "prior actions" triggering the tranche release for the Program. As suggested in the review,
it would have been clearer to state, for each policy area, what the budget support program included over two years,
followed by a subset of policy actions that the Bank had selected to support and why. Another recommendation was
referring to the performance indicators as "targets" rather than "benchmarks," which indicate comparisons, i.e, between
two countries, in meeting a given target. The ICRR has taken account of this recommendation and has used the term
"performance target" instead of benchmark.

66.     As is the rule for DPGs, program implementation is most active in the period
prior to approval of the operation. The steering of a DPG to Board approval is in fact
much more involved than standard supervision for investment projects. Moreover,
subsequent engagement through the country program  routine macro-monitoring,
follow-up of IMF work, preparation of a PER update, and work on a IFMIS project 
effectively ensured that significant supervision of the program initiated under this DPG.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory

67.     The combined rating of the Bank's overall performance was satisfactory,
reflecting the ICRR guidelines, which balances the satisfactory performance in ensuring
quality at entry and the satisfactory performance during supervision of the program.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory

68.     The Program Document noted a high degree of government commitment to
poverty reduction, maintenance of macroeconomic stability, improvements in public
administration and reform of the groundnut sector. In line with Bank recommendations,
the Government also began to increase the share of expenditures on programs for poverty
reduction as a percentage of all expenditures (See Section 3.5 and Table 6). In January
2010, the IMF's sixth review of the PRGF arrangement, covering performance in 2009,
found that macroeconomic policies had boosted GDP growth, continued to contain
inflation and reduced the fiscal deficit, with projections showing a surplus of equivalent
to about one percent of GDP expected by 2012. However, the IMF continued to express
concern about the total stock of debt, recommending that additional external financing
contain a high grant element. Therefore DPGs and other concessional forms of financing
are high priorities in the Government's strategy to attain higher economic growth while
maintaining fiscal balance and containing external debt. In terms of the achievement of
the policy actions for the DPG in 2008 and the continued improvements in
macroeconomic management during 2009, the Government's performance was
satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

69.     The Program had eight implementing entities ­MoF, MoA, MTRIE, GBOS,
GDA, GRA, NAO, and PMO --which made coordination of the achievements in terms
of performance indicators crucial to program evaluation. However, the lack of a progress
report from the coordinating entities--MoF and the NPC (National Planning
Commission) placed an additional burden on the Task Manager to cull various
government documents to report on program implementation from the various line
agencies and the explanatory information for not fully achieving some of the targets was
not available.

                                           27
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

70.   A mixed rating of "satisfactory" for one dimension of Borrower performance and
"moderately satisfactory" for another dimension results in an overall rating of
"moderately satisfactory" according to ICRR guidelines.

6. Lessons Learned

Sequential Donor Financing of Programmatic Budget Support

71.     The participation of several donors in a multi-year program for budget support
can increase the level of resources and focus them on a common objective but this
arrangement is more vulnerable to annual changes in donor priorities and requires timely
communication and coordination. The sequential donor financing of programmatic
budget support is inherently more risky than co-financing of a single annual operation
because planned resource allocations may change by the time the donor's annual program
for a given country is approved. And this risk seems likely to have increased with the
global economic downturn and shifting resource priorities. In the case of the Bank-
financed DPG, despite the signing of the MoU along with the AfDB and the Bank, the
EC, in response to the Bank's query about scheduling a joint donor review, reported that
it had re-evaluated its priorities and was planning to withdraw its participation in budget
support, leaving a sizeable resource gap (one percent of the budget for 2010).

Design and Coordination of Elements for Timely Monitoring and Evaluation

72.    Measurable performance indicators aligned with the capacity of the Borrower are
necessary but not sufficient elements of timely, effective M&E. It needs to be
accompanied by a clear delineation of reporting responsibilities (including the timing and
content) and close Bank supervision, particularly in a small country with limited capacity,
such as the Gambia. Otherwise, a DPG's performance evaluation runs the risk of being
delayed or incomplete.

73.     The DPG's design gave considerable attention to ensuring that the performance
indicators were measurable, realistic and did not depend on too many factors outside the
Borrower's control. For example, for revenue administration, the Bank and the Borrower
agreed to make the audit of the self-assessments of 20 of the largest taxpayers a key
indicator of performance in revenue administration instead of a percentage increase in
revenue because the latter indicator depended on economic factors outside the control of
GRA. However, by the closing date of the operation (end of December 2009), there was
no information available on the only indicator of improved revenue administration.

74.   As discussed in Section 2.3, a Cabinet subcommittee, the High-Level Economic
Committee (HILEC), was to provide overall guidance for the budget support program.
However the Program Document did not specify the composition of this subcommittee or
what the "guidance" would entail. MoF and the NPC were to assume overall

                                            28
responsibility for coordinating the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the
Policy Matrix with the "ultimate responsibility" for progress reporting and coordination
of other government agencies responsible for specific actions in the Policy Matrix.
However, there was no delineation in the allocation of responsibilities between MoF and
NPC, what the reports would contain or when they would be prepared.

75.     The Program Document also specifies that even after disbursement of its single
tranche, the Bank was to continue participating in annual reviews of the program. These
reviews were to monitor reform actions, evaluate the impact of the reforms on the
development objectives, and discuss strategic adjustments to the Policy Matrix taking
into account the latest country developments, stakeholder support and alternative options
for realizing the intended development objectives.

1.     A stakeholder's meeting to access the achievements under the Public Sector
Reform and Growth Development Policy Grant (DPG), which closed in December
2009, was organized by the Government of The Gambia on Wednesday, June 23,
2010. Representatives from the ministries and agencies responsible for implementing the
program supported by this grant provided additional information and analysis on the
achievement under the performance targets for this grant and expressed satisfaction with
the opportunity to carry out an evaluation of what was being achieved under the
performance targets for this operation.

2.      The updates on the achievements under the performance targets are
summarized below in Table A3 below. The views of the participants at the meeting
were in turn summed up by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, Mr.
Serign Cham, who described the exercise as a useful stocktaking that allows Government
to measure progress and access needs for additional technical assistance. Specifically, he
mentioned the need for additional technical assistance and support to GBOS ­ Gambian
Bureau of Statistics ­ which has been having difficulties replacing technical staff that has
died or retired. Assistance is needed in areas ranging from National Income Accounts to
Consumer and Wholesale Price Indexes.
