and\n            Growth Grant Project for Gambia were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: the participation of several\n            donors in a multi-year program for budget support can\n            increase the level of resources and focus them on a common\n            objective but this arrangement is more vulnerable to annual\n            changes in donor priorities and requires timely\n            communication and coordination. The sequential donor\n            financing of programmatic budget support is inherently more\n            risky than co-financing of a single annual operation because\n            planned resource allocations may change by the time the\n            donor's annual program for a given country is approved.\n            And this risk seems likely to have increased with the global\n            economic downturn and shifting resource priorities.\n            Measurable performance indicators aligned with the capacity\n            of the Borrower are necessary but not sufficient elements of\n            timely, effective Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E). It\n            needs to be accompanied by a clear delineation of reporting\n            responsibilities. The program document also specifies that\n            even after disbursement of its single tranche, the Bank was\n            to continue participating in annual reviews of the program.\n            These reviews were to monitor reform actions, evaluate the\n            impact of the reforms on the development objectives, and\n            discuss strategic adjustments to the policy matrix taking\n            into account the latest country developments, stakeholder\n            support and alternative options for realizing the intended\n            development objectives."}, "docdt": "2010-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
