The FESAC supported the government's efforts\n            to reduce the quasi-fiscal deficit by stemming the flow of\n            enterprise losses. This complimented the macroeconomic\n            program supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\n            Stand-by Arrangement. Specifically, the FESAC addressed four\n            major issues: (a) the slow pace of privatization; (b) the\n            losses incurred by 25 politically sensitive enterprises; (c)\n            the adverse social impact of labor shedding in those 25\n            enterprises; and (d) the illiquidity of 80 percent of the\n            banking system. Bank's performance was satisfactory.\n            Borrower's performance was satisfactory.  The key\n            lessons learned were as folows: (a) the design weakness of\n            the ERL, leaving implementation of agreed reforms to a\n            \"follow-up operation\", the FESAC, made preparation\n            of the FESAC more difficult than it otherwise might have\n            been; (b) when dealing with a new member state, the Bank\n            needs to be very careful about the signals it gives; (c)\n            when a country is committed to reforms, it will implement\n            them with or without conditionality; (d) difficult and\n            painful reforms can be implemented only with strong\n            political support; (e) where institutions are weak,\n            adjustment operations have to be accompanied by technical\n            assistance to ensure that the country has the required\n            expertise to implement agreed reforms; (f) in spite of a\n            government's best intentions, some measures prove to be\n            too politically difricult to implement; and (g) to avoid\n            misunderstandings concerning the necessary actions prior to\n            tranche release, it is extremely important to have\n            consistency in wording among the body of the\n            President's report, the policy matrix and the Loan Agreement."}, "docdt": "1997-06-02T00:00:00Z"}
