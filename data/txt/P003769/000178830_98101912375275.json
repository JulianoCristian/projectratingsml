Two of these dams are critical to the realization of\n            benefits from the proposed project works. Following their\n            construction, the project will benefit about 189,000\n            families and will increase rice production by 273,000 tons\n            per year. Project risks are normal for projects of this kind."}, "docdt": "1978-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
