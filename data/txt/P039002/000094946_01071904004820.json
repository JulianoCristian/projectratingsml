Lessons convey the need\n            for attention in forecasting water sales during major\n            macroeconomic, and structural reforms, because the\n            elasticity of demand may trigger unexpected household\n            consumption, and similarly, industrial restructuring will\n            cause variations on the industrial, and commercial demand\n            for water. And, it is re-emphasized that a successful\n            program for reduction of unaccounted-for-water, requires\n            strong Government commitments, well defined project design,\n            providing a supportive program of action. However, greater\n            progress could have been possible, had the Borrower made\n            full use of the technical assistance possibilities under the\n            project. While the Bank's supervision was rated\n            outstanding by the Quality Assurance Group, it could have\n            been further beneficial, if during supervision, the\n            appropriate arrangements for monitoring progress, and\n            evaluating the impacts of the sewerage components were in\n            place, for sewerage was an integral part of the project,\n            irrespective of the fact that such components, were not\n            financed by the loan, and, it is thus suggested the Bank\n            should focus on the overall objectives of the project during\n            implementation. Finally, in the presence of highly qualified\n            technical staff, as is the case of the Butoniga Water Works\n            (BWW), the Bank should be particularly careful in supporting\n            a turn-key contract, rather a separate contract design would\n            have further benefited BWW, and, eliminated controversial\n            delays over design, and equipment selection."}, "docdt": "2001-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
