About     this Report
       The Operations       Evaluation       Department     assesses the programs          and activities of the World Bank for two
purposes:      first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank's self-evaluation             process and to verify that the Bank's work is
producing      the expected       results, and second, to help develop improved              directions,   policies, and procedures        through
the dissemination        of lessons drawn from experience.            As part of this work, OED annually            assesses about 25 percent of
the Bank's lending operations.             In selecting   operations   for assessment,       preference     is given to those that are
innovative,     large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming                 studies or country evaluations;         those for which
Executive      Directors or Bank management              have requested      assessments;       and those that are likely to generate
important     lessons. The projects, topics, and analytical approaches                  selected for assessment         support    larger evaluation
studies.
       A Project Performance            Assessment       Report (PPAR)       is based on a review of the Implementation                Completion
Report (a self-evaluation           by the responsible       Bank department)        and fieldwork     conducted      by OED. To prepare
PPARs, OED staff examine                project files and other documents,           interview   operational     staff, and in most cases visit
the borrowing        country for onsite discussions          with project staff and beneficiaries.         The PPAR thereby          seeks to
validate    and augment         the information      provided    in the ICR, as well as examine          issues of special      interest to broader
OED studies.
       Each PPAR is subject to a peer review process                   and OED management             approval.     Once cleared       internally,  the
PPAR      is reviewed     by the responsible         Bank department       and amended        as necessary.       The completed        PPAR is then
sent to the borrower        for review; the borrowers'          comments      are attached      to the document       that is sent to the Bank's
Board of Executive         Directors.     After an assessment         report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed               to the public.


About     the OED Rating           System
       The time-tested       evaluation       methods    used by OED are suited to the broad range of the World                     Bank's work.
The methods         offer both rigor and a necessary            level of flexibility  to adapt to lending      instrument,     project design,     or
sectoral    approach.      OED evaluators         all apply the same basic method to arrive at their project                ratings. Following      is
the definition     and rating scale used for each evaluation               criterion   (more information      is available     on the OED website:
http://worldbank.org/oed/eta-mainpage.                 html).
       Relevance       of Objectives:         The extent to which the project's         objectives   are consistent       with the country's
current development           priorities   and with current Bank country and sectoral              assistance     strategies    and corporate
goals (expressed         in Poverty Reduction          Strategy   Papers,   Country Assistance         Strategies,     Sector Strategy      Papers,
Operational       Policies).   Possible      ratings: High, Substantial,      Modest, Negligible.
       Efficacy:     The extent to which the project's            objectives    were achieved,      or expected     to be achieved,       taking into
account their relative        importance.       Possible   ratings: High, Substa ntial, Modest, Negligible.
       EtVciency:       The extent to which the project achieved,               or is expected    to achieve,     a return higher than the
opportunity      cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared                 to alternatives.    Possible   ratings:    High, Substantial,
Modest,      Negligible.   This rating is not generally         applied   to adjustment      operations.
       SustainabIl&y:       The resilience        to risk of net benefits flows over time. Possible            ratings:   Highly Likely, Likely,

       institutional     Development           Impact:   The extent to which a project improves              the ability of a country or region
to make more efficient,          equitable     and sustainable      use of its human, financial,       and natural      resources     through:    (a)
better de~nition,       stability, transparency,       enforceability,    and predictability     of institutional   arrangements        and/or (b)
better alignment        of the mission and capacity          of an organization       with its mandate,      which derives from these
institutional    arrangements.         Institutional  Development       Impact includes       both intended     and unintended        effects of a
project. Possible       rafings:   High, Substantial,       Modest,    Negligible.

Preface

        This is a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) on the Istria Water
Supply and Sewerage Project (Loan 3069-HR), approved for an IBRD loan of US$27.8
million on May 23, 1989. The loan closed on December 31,2000, five years behind the
original schedule.

        This report is based on the Implementation Completion Report (ICR), dated June
20,2001, and prepared by the Europe and Central Asia Region, the appraisal documents,
loan documents, project files, and discus&ons with the relevant Bank staff. An
Operations Evaluation Department (OED) mission visited Croatia in June 2003 to discuss
the effectiveness of the Bank's assistancewith the government, project implementing
agency and operating water companies, as well as other stakeholders. The cooperation
and assistanceof central government officials, management and staff of the Butoniga
Water Works, Istria Water Works and Pula Water Works, and other interested parties are
gratefully acknowledged.

        The assessedproject was part of a larger project that was appraised and approved
before the break-up of Yugoslavia. The original project was split into two separate
projects in 1993: the Istria component in Croatia and the Slovene Coast component in
Slovenia. The focus of the Istria part of the project was the elimination of water shortages
that had become a serious impediment for the development of the tourism industry in the
Istria region. In addition, the project aimed to strengthenthe two operating water
companies and to improve their operational efficiency. This PPAR also provides input to
OED's forthcoming country assistanceevaluation of Croatia.

        Following standard OED procedures, the draft PPAR was sent to the relevant
government officials and agencies for their review and comments, but none were
received. In accordance with the Bank's disclosure policy, the final report will be
available to the public following submission to the World Bank's Board of Executive
Directors.

 Summary

         The Istria Water Supply and Sewerage Project was approved for an IBID            loan
of US$27.8 million equivalent on May 23, 1989. The loan closed on December 31,2000,
after three extensions totaling five years. By the closing date, US$22.5 million had been
disbursed; the rest of the loan was cancelled. The two largest water supply entities in the
Istria region are the Istria Water Works and the Pula Water Works. These entities were
the borrowers and sources of counterpart funding.

         The assessedproject was part of a larger project that was appraised and approved
before the breakup of Yugoslavia. The original project was split into two separate
projects in 1993 -   the Istria component in Croatia and the Slovene Coast component in
Slovenia. The Slovenia Project was completed at the end of 1998. The focus of the
present assessmentis on the Istria project.

         At loan closing, a substantial part of the Istria project was completed, including
water transmission mains, distribution reservoirs, and main pumping stations. One key
component -     the Butoniga water treatment plant (WTP) -        which accounted for over
one-fourth of the total project costs at appraisal, was still under construction at the time of
project completion. The construction of the plant was completed in June 2002, and it was
finally commissioned and certified by the local authorities for production of potable
water in June 2003. The significant delay in the completion of Butoniga WTP can largely
be attributed to the interruptions causedby the war, but complex contractual
arrangements contributed to the delay as well.

         This assessmentfinds that the project achieved its main objective, to eliminate
water shortagesin the Istria region. These shortageshad become a major obstacle to the
growth of the tourism industry, a mainstay of the area's economy. Improving the
efficiency of the two water operators-     by reducing their unaccounted-water ratio and
making them financially viable -     was another main objective. This objective was only
partially achieved as both operators are yet to meet their cost recovery targets. The
assessment,however, verifies that positive progress has continued in thesetwo areas
since loan closing in 2000. Moreover, the water companies have a growing number of
service connections, and the declining staff index within both companies is a clear
indication of improving efficiency. As the growth of actual water sales has been slower
than anticipated, financial indicators have not yet improved as fast as expected. Similarly,
the companies have been unable to reduce unaccounted water effectively enough to have
an impact on their financial situation. These two aspectsremain as risk factors for the
long-term sustainability of benefits.

        The project was reasonably successful and its overall outcome is rated
moderately satisfactory. More substantial achievements in meeting financial goals and
stronger efficiency gains would have been necessary for a higher rating. The institutional
development impact is rated modest and sustainability likely, but with some reservations,
as noted above. The Bank performance and the borrower performance areboth rated
satisfactory.

                                             X



      Following are some key lessons from the project's experience:

  During implementation, it is important to maintain the balance between the
  construction of infrastructure and institutional strengthening according to the
  priorities established in the project design. Projects with major physical investments
  tend to become focused on these investment components, favoring them in project
  supervision as well. In this project, the entities responsible for institutional aspects
  and operational improvements were less closely supervised by the Bank than the
  Project Implementation Unit and, thus, the components under their purview received
  less attention during project supervision. Responsibilities for implementation should
  be assigned in a manner that ensuresthat the requisite balance is maintained.

  In extraordinary circumstances such as following a major         interruption in
  implementation, substantial revisions or adjustments to the project components
  may be needed. This project provides a good example of how new demand
  projections and corresponding changesin project design can be called for under
  drastically changing conditions. If such circumstances arise, a careful review and
  appropriate revisions should be carried out. In this case,it should have taken place
  around 1995 (after the war) when the project was re-launched for final
  implementation.


l The implementation plan for reducing unaccounted water, including detailed
  annual targets, needs to be specified in the project preparation documents. These
  are difficult issues and achieving concrete results often requires more time than is
  available within a normal project cycle. Had this plan been designed better with
  detailed annual targets, its implementation and supervision would have been less
  disrupted by the difficult wartime circumstances. Therefore, design of activities, and
  particularly the implementation priorities, have to be defined with extra care.

BACKGROUND

1        Croatia is a middle-income country in South-East Europe progressing towards a
market economy and aiming to attain full European Union membership in the next
decade or so.' Following the break-up of the former Socialist Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (FSFRY), Croatia became independent in 1991 andjoined the World Bank in
1993. The major obstacles to further progress are the costly reconstruction and difficult
social reconciliation resulting from the break-up and the 1991-95 war. Croatia is now a
member of the World Trade Organization and has free trade agreementswith 28
countries, including all EU countries.

2        Early in the transition period, the emphasis was on a stabilization program that
was launched in 1993. As a result, increased private consumption and a recovery of
exports pulled the economy out of recession by 2000. Boosted by increased tourism
revenues,2the current account deficit has been reduced to its lowest level of the past
seven years.


Water and Sanitation Sector

3        The major challenge for the water sector institutions in Croatia is to increase
financial resources, as the capacity to finance new investments from budgetary sources
decreasedsignificantly after the 1991-95 war. The means to achieve this goal is better
resource mobilization at the utility level to be achieved through (i) efficiency
improvements; (ii) increased private sector participation in utility management and
operations; and (iii) streamlining of the existing institutional and regulatory ETamework.3
Special attention to the cost effectiveness of investments and operation is also required.

4        Service coverage in Croatia before the war was 76 percent for water supply and
67 percent for sewerage,but with the lack of regular maintenance duringthewar,
coveragedeclined significantly. AlthoughtheIstriaregionhadreasonablysatisfactory
water supply coverage before the war, it was affected by water shortages, especially
during dry summer seasons,thus hindering tourism, a traditional mainstay of Istria's
economy; 4some40 percent of Croatia's tourism capacity is in the Istria region. It was in
this context that the World Bank prepared the Istria and Slovene Coast Water Supply and
Sewerage Project in the late-1980s. In 1993, the original project was split into two
separateprojects for Istria and Slovenia? The present report evaluates only the Istria
project.

5        The two largest water supply operators (vodovod) in the Istria region are the Istria
Water Works (IWW) and the Pula Water Works (PLOW). For the purpose of efficiently
preparing and implementing the Istria component of the original project, IWW and PWW
had agreedto establish a new water company, the Butoniga Water Works (BWW), as a
special project implementation unit. BWW shouldered the sole responsibility for the
implementation of the water supply related components, (i) and (ii) in para. 9 below.
BWW was also given the responsibility to coordinate the implementation of the
institutional strengthening.activities and sewerageworks, (iii) and (iv) in para. 9 below,
although the actual implementation was the responsibility of the two vodovods and six
communities, respectively. The Bank agreedto this arrangement at project appraisal. It
was then also understood that BWW would ceaseto exist after the project was
completed.


World Bank Role

6        The World Bank has provided fmancial support, technical assistance,and policy
advice to Croatia since the new country joined the Bank in 1993. Financial support to
various projects has totaled about US$l .1 billion; 12 projects are currently underway and
another 8 are under preparation. Initially, lending focused on investments in
infrastructure to addressthe substantial needs of post-war reconstruction. These
investments total about US$520 million, of which the water sector projects account for
some US$lO5 million covering several water supply and seweragesystems, pumping
stations and waste water treatment plants.

7        The water sector projects now underway, and those being prepared, focus on
support to pollution control of the Adriatic Sea,which is the major resource of the
tourism industry. These projects are aligned with the most recent Country Assistance
Strategy6(CAS), which emphasizes sustained growth by "job creation, reducingpublic
expenditure and development ofprivate sector in utilities and infrastructure, and
environmental sustainability." The tourism industry is today of high priority in generating
income and employment in Croatia. The Istria project assessedhere, follows this general
approach.


THEPROJECT

Objectives

8        The project's development objectives, as defined at appraisal, were to: (i)
eliminate existing water shortagesin the project area; (ii) provide additional water supply
capacity needed for the expansion of the tourism industry and growth in domestic and
industriaVcommercia1 demand in the project area; (iii) reduce unaccounted water in the
Pula Water Works (PVVW) distribution network; (iv) protect existing water sources and
coastal tourist areasfrom pollution; and (v) increase efficiency in the delivery of water
supply and sewerageservices in the project area.These original objectives were not
revised during project implementation.

22      Since 1996, the number of ISVW connections has increased on average3.5 percent
per year, compared to 2 percent before the conflict. The numbers for PWMJ are 5.5
percent and 3 percent, respectively. The relatively rapid increase in service connections,
after the water supply capacity and reliability were improved, indicates that the water
supply coverage targets have been met (seepara. 10).

23      Despite the adequatesupply capacity now from the Butoniga WTP, increasing
number of service connections, and growth in water salesin the IVIW system, the overall
water sales have not yet gone up as expected at project appraisal. As a result, the
revenues from water tariffs cover only operation and maintenance costs and no provision
for future capital investments can yet be made. Data provided by BWW to the PPAR
team show that both water operators are still unable to meet their agreedfinancial targets
    an operating ratio of less than 80 percent (total operating expenses/total operating
revenues x 100). In 2002, IWW achieved an operating ratio of about 90 percent, down
from 100 percent in 1996, whereas PWW, despite some improvements, has not yet
managed to lower its operating ratio below the 100 percent mark.

24      Another efficiency indicator, the staff index (number of staff per 1000 service
connections), is currently showing a steadily improving trend. In IVVW, the staff index
has come down from about 10 in 1990 (8.8 in 1996) to 7.5 in 2002. PWW has fared even
better, with a reduction of the staff index from about 11 in 1990 (9.5 in 1996) to 7.2 at the
end of 2002.' These improvements show better management and should result in more
efficient overall operations of the systems.

25      The reduction of unaccounted water was set as another key objective for
achieving operational efficiency. NVFV reached an unaccounted-water level of 19 percent
in 2002, somewhat better than before the project (22 percent) and the 21 percent target set
at project appraisal. During project implementation in 1996, the unaccounted-water ratio
was as high as 25 percent (all numbers include water salesto IXizanaWater Works in
Slovenia). The progress in Pula is not quite the same; the unaccounted-water ratio there
was about 30 percent before the project, about 31 percent in 1996 during project
implementation, and remains at the same level today; the target set for PWW at project
appraisal was 25 percent.




9. These achievements meet the goals as envisaged at the time of project appraisal; today water utilities in
EU-countries for instance have staff index of 4 or lower.

 26       The experience of this project reflects the well-known lesson that reducing
unaccounted water requires high-level commitment, is quite time consuming, and quick
positive results are hard to achieve. Appraisal documents state that the project will
provide instrumentation for water loss control in the Pula distribution system. Further,
both operators were required to implement a pre-agreedplan of action for the reduction
of unaccounted water early in the project cycle. This did not happen in the caseof PWW
as it postponed these activities and have included intensified efforts for unaccounted-
water reduction in its future operating plans. The reason for the delay was that PWW
preferred not to use loan funds for this purpose. Unfortunately, Bank supervision was too
lax on this point and did not follow up to specify what these "intensified efforts" would
really contain, and if they could truly be acceptable substitutes for the earlier pre-agreed
actions.

27.       It is likely that the design of the component, and activities therein, to reduce
unaccounted water was not adequate.Moreover, too little emphasis was put on activities
to reduce unaccounted water during project supervision whereas other, perhaps more
immediate issues such as the problems faced by BWTP, seem to have received higher
priority. As a result, the Bank had only infrequent direct contacts with the two operating
water companies responsible for activities to reduce unaccounted water.

28        The water demand in the Istria region has been increasing since the end of the
war. The key factor in this has been the growth of the tourism industry. In 1993, the
number of tourists in Istria was reportedly some 700,000 per year. In 2002, the number
was as high as 2.4 million and is expected to grow further? The Istria region is ideally
located to attract tourists from Austria, Germany, Italy, and Slovenia, which accounted
for over 70 percent of the tourist visits to Istria in 2002. The rest are mostly visitors from
other central European countries and the UK. Future plans arebeing finalized and will be
basedon high-end (higher quality-paying more) tourism rather than on just increased
volumes of visitors. The improved water supply now supports this continued growth in
tourism activities.

29.      The potential peak water demand from the tourism industry alone is currently
some 45,000 cubic-meters per day in the high season," that is, over 50 percent of the total
capacity of BWTP. The actual water sales for household consumption (excluding
tourism) were 25,100 cubic-meters per day averageover the year 2002 and are now
starting to increase within the IWLV system (seepara. 21). The total of the two above is
thus over 70,000 cubic-meters per day, that is, over 80 percent of the total capacity of the
BWTP (86,400 cubic-meters per day). The unaccounted-water ratio is still very high at
30 percent of the total in the Pula system. This demonstrates the urgency of focusing on
activities to reduce unaccounted water. Such a reduction would be the immediate least-
cost solution to increasing available water.




10. The data is based on the information provided in the interview of offkials of the Istria County Tourist
Association.

30      Sewerage    service and treatment  of waste water are still huge issues in Istria.
Although the responsible municipalities have completed about 70 percent of the sewerage
works included in the project (there was no Bank funding for this component), the
environmental protection objectives are not yet met as envisaged. Out of some 20 main
communities (towns) in the region, only four have secondary (biological) waste water
treatment plants in operation; the rest of the towns have only primary (mechanical)
treatment plants and there are still a few communities without any waste water treatment
at all. This matter requires urgent attention and practical solutions for improvement.

31      The six municipalities responsible for the sewerageworks were not effectively
supervised by the Bank. The Bank should have committed adequateresources for
supervision and progress monitoring of all these activities, as they were linked with
respective project objectives. The Bank is currently emphasizing the importance of the
protection of the coastal waters of the Adriatic Sea, essential to the successof the tourism
industry, and has included this as a major objective in its sector strategy. Practical project
preparation work is also underway to this effect.


RATINGS


Outcome

32      The project achieved most of its relevant objectives albeit relatively late as far as
BWTP is concerned, but there were shortcomings in meeting financial and efficiency
goals. Its overall outcome therefore, is rated moderately satisfactory. The overall rating is
based on the achievement of the project's various objectives in terms of relevance,
efficacy, and efficiency.

        0i     Relevance.All components were relevant considering agreed
                Bank/borrower priorities and the region's needs at the time of project
                appraisal. As a result of the break-up of Yugoslavia, the economic life of
                the Istria Region changed. Industrial activities in particular experienced
                substantial reductions. For this reason,the BWTP provided large excess
                capacity that did not immediately produce incremental revenue for the
               water supply operators. Their financial situation is gradually improving as
                the number of service connections is increasing, and especially with the
                growth of the tourism industry, all available water production capacity
                will be in great demand.

        (ii >  EYcacy.The project's objectives were achieved although with adelay of
                five years. The key component, BWTP, was delayed by another year and a
               half, and was completed only in June 2002 and commissioned in June
               2003. Other components have been implemented to their fullest extent and
                in a timely fashion and were ready for Ml-scale operation as the WTP
               became operational.

Sustainability

36      Sustai~abiii~ is rated likely with some reservations. The operating water
companies, IWW and PWW, are not yet meeting their financial targets -          an operating
ratio of less than 80 percent -   as spelled out in the project agreement. However, this is
likely to happen in the next few years after all new facilities have been in full operation
for some time, and water demand has increased to the anticipated level, given the
increasing number of service connections and further progress made in the reduction of
unaccounted water. Pending improvements in financial performance through further
efficiency gains and increasing water sales are the main risk factors for sustainability. In
technical terms, the two water companies are experienced operators, and with the new
and technically sound facilities they can be expected to provide reliable water services.


Bank Performance

37      Bankperformance is rated satisfactory. Bank staff provided substantive support
during project preparation to streamline the documentation for procurement of goods and
services and construction of new facilities. The samepractice continued during project
supervision. This was recognized by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG) review of this
project in 1999, as it rated the supervision of the project highly satisfactory. The
assessmentfindings reveal that the Bank paid less attention to (i) the implementation of
study recommendations, (ii) activities to reduce unaccounted water, and (iii) the
supervision of sewerageworks. Most of this is a result of the complex design of the
project's institutional set-up. This made the Bank focus in its supervision role on the
physical construction of facilities by BWW and only remotely to deal with the operating
companies and the various parties responsible for sewerage.The total resources used by
the Bank in the preparation and supervision of this project were only US$O.17 million, or
just about 0.6 percent of the loan amount; supervision costs were some 27 percent of the
total Bank costs. In this respect, there certainly was room to allocate more resourcesto
cover the areasthat received less attention during project supervision.


Borrower Performance

38      Borrower performance is rated satisfactory. The borrower provided an effective
team for the project implementation unit, but faced serious problems in contracting
BWTP. Its implementation continued to be hampered by various problems causing
substantial delay and extra costs, In the end, the contractor consented to BWW's demand
for compensations of US$6.0 million. Overall, BWW's contract management was firm
and, under the circumstances, effective. VVhereit failed, to some extent, was the
administration of the turn-key contract to construct BWTP. The two operating water
companies did not perform as anticipated in achieving efficiency gains in their
operations, but some visible improvements were made and the progress seemsto have
continued after loan closing.

LESSONS

39.    Following are some key lessons from the project's experience:

   During implementation, it is important to maintain the balance between the
   construction of infrastructure and institutional strengthening according to the
   priorities established in the project design. Projects with major physical investments
   tend to become focused on these investment components, favoring them in project
   supervision as well. In this project, the entities responsible for institutional aspects
   and operational improvements were less closely supervised by the Bank than the
   Project Implementation Unit and, thus, the components under their purview received
   less attention during project supervision. Responsibilities for implementation should
   be assigned in a manner that ensuresthat the requisite balance is maintained (see
   paras. 13-l 7).


l  In extraordinary circumstances such asfollowing a major interruption in
   implementation, substantial revisions or adjustments to the project components
   may be needed. This project provides a good example of how new demand
   projections and corresponding changesin project design can be called for under
   drastically changing conditions. If such circumstances arise, a careful review and
   appropriate revisions should be carried out. In this case, it should have taken place
   around 1995 (after the war) when the project was re-launched for final
   implementation (seeparas. 17 and 29).

   The implementation plan for reducing unaccounted water, including detailed
   annual targets, needs to be specified in the project preparation documents. These
   are difficult issues and achieving concrete results often requires more time than is
   available within a normal project cycle. Had this plan been designed better with
   detailed annual targets, its implementation and supervision would have been less
   disrupted by the difficult wartime circumstances. Therefore, design of activities, and
   particularly the implementation priorities, have to be defined with extra care (see
   paras. 25-26).
