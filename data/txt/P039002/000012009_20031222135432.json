Lessons of experience are\n            suggested as follows. During implementation, it is important\n            to maintain the balance between the construction of\n            infrastructure, and institutional strengthening in\n            accordance with priorities established in the project\n            design. Notwithstanding, in extraordinary circumstances,\n            such as following a major interruption in implementation,\n            substantial revisions or adjustments to the project\n            components may be needed. This project provides a good\n            example of how new demand projections, and corresponding\n            changes in project design can be called upon, under\n            drastically changing conditions, through implementation of a\n            careful review and appropriate revisions. In this case, it\n            should have taken place around 1995 (after the war) when the\n            project was re-launched for final implementation.\n            Furthermore, the implementation plan for reducing\n            unaccounted water, including detailed annual targets, needs\n            to be specified in the project preparation documents. Had\n            this plan been better designed with detailed annual targets,\n            its implementation and supervision would have been less\n            disrupted by the difficult wartime circumstances."}, "docdt": "2003-12-10T00:00:00Z"}
