                           RESTRUCTURIING PAPER


A. SUMMARY


1.       The proposed changes include: (i) a nine month extension of the Credit closing
date from September 30, 2013 to June 30, 2014 to complete the ongoing project
activities; (ii) a re-allocation of the project proceeds based on the disbursement forecasts;
and (iii) an adjustment of IDA road maintenance target.

B.     PROJECT STATUS

2.      The project was approved by the Board on May 20, 2008 with a Credit amount of
SDR18.3 million. The Development Credit Agreement was declared effective on
December 13, 2008 with an original Credit closing date of September 30, 2013. After
difficulties at the start up due to failures in the procurement process, the project is now in
a good dynamic to achieve its development goals. The PDO and the overall
implementation performance have been rated moderately satisfactory and satisfactory,
respectively based on the following progress:

      The project is in a good dynamic to achieve its development goals. The road map
       agreed during the Mid-Term Review is being implemented by the Implementation
       Agency and closely monitored by the Minister of Public Works and Transports.

      The implementation of the civil works is progressing smoothly. All the
       procurement activities under road asset management component are fully
       completed and the Year 1, Year 2 and Year 3 road maintenance programs which
       are the main activities of the project are expected to be fully completed by June
       30, 2013. The Year 4 road maintenance program on National Road No.7 (one lot
       of 77 km) just started and will not be completed within the current Closing Date
       of September 30, 2013.

      Good progress has been made for the capacity development component: (i) all
       consultancy services and training programs are ongoing; (ii) in most of the
       Regional Offices, the road maintenance activities are now outsourced to private
       sector; and (iii) the Road Safety and HIV/AIDS awareness programs are being
       implemented as planned. Only the Road Data Collection Management Unit
       (RDCMU) is not fully operational due to technical problems to transfer the data
       collected to HDM4 and staff turnover issue. To address the technical problem, a
       qualified HDM4 specialist is expected to strengthen the consultant team.

3.      As of February 15, 2013, the cumulative disbursements are SDR 11.65 million (or
64% of the total allocated amount). An acceptable Action Plan to fully disburse the credit
amount by the proposed closing date of June 30, 2014 has been discussed and agreed
with the Borrower. There are no outstanding audits and the project is in compliance with
all applicable Bank safeguards policies.
       C. PROPOSED CHANGES


       4.      Closing Date. An extension of the Credit closing date from September 30, 2013
       until June 30, 2014 is proposed to enable the Ministry of Public Works and Transport
       (MPWT) to complete the remaining activities, notably the Year 4 road maintenance
       program on National Road No.7 which will not be completed within the current closing
       date of September 30, 2013, and to complete capacity building activities within the
       RDCMU. ADB and AusAID have also agreed with the Borrower to extend their projects
       closing date until June 30, 2014. Therefore, it is proposed that all donor financing has the
       same closing date and the donors agree to have a joint ICR.

       5.      Reallocation of the Project Proceeds. The proposed reallocation of Credit
       proceeds is based on the actual cost calculations for the newly proposed project period.
       Additional SDR470,000 will be allocated to the category 3 to allow the completion of the
       planning activity and to build the capacity within the RDCMU by reducing the
       allocations of categories 1, 2, 4 and 5 with an equivalent amount.

6.      IDA road maintenance target. The newly agreed road maintenance target for
IDA Credit is 500 km instead of 800 km. IDA financing is used for the rehabilitation of
the road sections that are the most degraded, and current assessment indicated that 500km
of the degraded roads would need to be rehabilitated on a priority basis. The change of
this target in the Document of the Credit Agreement has no impact on the results
framework and will not affect the achievement of the PDO.
