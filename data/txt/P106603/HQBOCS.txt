Re: Road Asset Management Project
Credit Number H4442-KH
Amendments
We refer to the Financing Agreement between the Kingdom of Cambodia (the
Recipient) and the International Development Association (the Association), dated June
13, 2008 for the Road Asset Management Project (the Project). We also refer to your
letter dated January 31, 2013 proposing to extend the Closing Date of the Project and to
reallocate the proceeds of the Financing among Categories in order to facilitate the
implementation of the Project. We also need to amend the description of the Project to
reduce the amount of support for the implementation of annual work plans for periodic
maintenance on MPWT's road network.
Accordingly, the Association proposes to amend the Financing Agreement as set
out below.
1. Paragraph 1 of Part A of Schedule 1 to the Financing Agreement is amended to
read as follows:
"1.    Providing support for the implementation of annual workplans for
periodic maintenance on about five hundred (500) kilometers of MPWT's road
network, including asphalt resurfacing, resealing, re-gravelling, minor drainage
works, and repairs to small bridges.
2. The Association has established June 30, 2014 as the later date for purposes of
Section IV.B.2 of Schedule 2 to the Financing Agreement.
3. The table in Section IV.A.2 of Schedule 2 to the Financing Agreement is
replaced with the table in the Attachment to this amendment letter.
Except as specifically reflected in this amendment letter, all provisions of the
Financing Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

Unless the context otherwise requires and except where otherwise defined in this
amendment letter all capitalized terms contained in this amendment letter shall have the
meanings given to them in the Financing Agreement.
Please confirm your agreement with the amendments set out above by
countersigning, dating and returning to us one original of this amendment letter. Upon
receipt by the Association of the countersigned original of this amendment letter, the
amendments shall become effective as of the date of the countersignature date.
Sincerely,
