to development outcome was\n            substantial, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: monitoring and evaluation (M and\n            E) frameworks that are useful beyond the project level need\n            to employ indicators that are relevant to decision-makers.\n            Use of temporary, parallel systems does little to create\n            lasting and durable improvements and or change. Strong\n            commitment of the implementing agency is key to success. The\n            combination of supervision by local Bank staff whose\n            proximity enables them to provide timely advice and solve\n            problems, with the participation of international staff with\n            expertise in specific areas when needed, yields good\n            results. Capacity and system gains can be leveraged to meet\n            broader needs."}, "docdt": "2015-06-08T00:28:04Z"}
