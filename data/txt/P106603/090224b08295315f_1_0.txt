               Target achieved. The result indicator was closely reviewed by the mission. Data complied by the MPWT indicated 30% of civil works
               perform by private sectors during 2014. Force account is gradually being reduced and contracting out of road rehabilitation and
               maintenance is increasing.
               The divestiture of force account target over time is being finalized by MPWT in collaboration with MEF.
