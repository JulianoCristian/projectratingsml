The Bank's performance in initiating the\n            action plan and reallocating funds from the social sector to\n            the individual sector was adequate. The Bank's impact\n            on institution building has been marginal. During\n            implementation of the loan the supervision of the\n            subprojects by the borrower was largely ineffective. Some of\n            the lessons learned included: a) Future projects, to the\n            extent possible, should allocate significant funds for\n            institution building to ensure adequate appraisal,\n            supervision and monitoring of investment plans; b)\n            Supervision tasks be exclusively designated to be carried\n            out by the borrower, with provision in the loan for\n            financing any incidental foreign exchange expenditures as on\n            vehicles and foreign consultant; c) The Bank should focus on\n            choosing a borrower that has the capacity to attract the\n            qualified staff and the managerial skills that are essential\n            for implementing the necessary reforms and maintaining a\n            fruitful dialogue with the Bank; and d) The Bank should give\n            adequate attention to training which is the key component\n            for institution building."}, "docdt": "1988-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
