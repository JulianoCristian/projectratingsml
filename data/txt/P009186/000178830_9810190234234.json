consist of:\n            primary agricultural production in the individual sector.\n            Sub-loans would be made to about 18,800 individual farmers\n            through cooperatives for livestock development to produce\n            milk, beef, pork, chicken, lamb, and fruit and vegetable. In\n            addition, to improve land productivity and help meet Plan\n            production targets, the project would finance investments in\n            drainage on about 13,000 ha of individual sector land and\n            irrigation totalling about 5,000 ha in both social and\n            individual sectors. Sub-loans would also be provided for\n            support services or joint facilities which would assist in\n            the expansion of primary agricultural production in the\n            individual sector. Typical investments would include grain\n            drying and storage facilities, milk collection centers,\n            pasture improvement, and farm machinery services;\n            agroindustries development of processing capacities to\n            ensure an adequate and assured market for incremental\n            agricultural production and to meet the fast growing\n            consumer demand for processed foods. In keeping with the\n            Plan objectives, sub-loans for agroindustries would focus\n            mainly on processing of milk, meat, fruits and vegetables\n            all in the social sector.
