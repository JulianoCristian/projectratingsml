SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Thlis report covers the appraisal of a project consisting of two
additions to the generating svstem of the Electricitv Generating Authoritv
of i'hailand (EGAT) for which a ioan of US$46.5 million equivalent is pro-
posed.  These additions, one the third unit (310 Mw) at the South Bangkok
TLermal Station and the other, a 250 Mw hydro plant at the Sirikit Dam,
which is presently under construction, represent the best solution for
meeting system load growth starting in late 1973. Additional facilities
will be required in about 1976.
ii.       EGAT is a new entity resulting from the merger on May 1, 1969
of three power authorities.   The Bank was instrumental in setting up the
largest of these, the Yanhee Electricity Authority (YEA), in connection
with the first power loan to Thailand in 1957. For practical purposes,
EGAT can be considered the same as the former YEA with somewhat enlarged
responsibilities. 'T'he management remains the same and is good. EGAT is
responsible for generation and transmission throughout Thailand.
iii.      Load growth has been and continues to be high by any standards,
averaging over 27% per year since 1961, with increases of around 30;% during
recent years. For the eight years 1969 through 1976 energy growth is ex-
pected to average about 18 1/2% annually, decreasing to 12 1/2% in 1976.
P'ower demand would increase 3-1/2 times, from 487 Dw in 1968 to 1,730 Mqw
in 1976. The past and present high growth rates complicate system plan-
ning as significant tapering off cannot be assumed in the short range
without risking the need for rationing later on. Obviously, if load growth
slaclcens abruptly some capacity already committed to construction will come
into service earlier than ideally required. But this is an unavoidable
risk if reasonable system security is to be maintained.
iv.       Thie project is expected to cost about US$83.6 million includinR
interest during construction on the Bank loan and other borrowings but not
duties. It would be financed approximately 30% by internal cash generation
and 70% by borrowing.   The Bank loan would represent 56/% of total project
costs before duties and would cover the expected foreign exchange costs
but not interest during construction on the Bank loan. Total capital in-
vestments during the approximate period of construction for the proiect
would be about US$332 inillion.  No problems are anticipated in financing
this level of investment as the financial situation is expected to remain
sounldl.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.(1      in September 1967 the Biank made a loan (514 Tii) to the Government
of 'lhailand for thie construction of a dam on the Nan River in northern
Thailand to provide for increased irrigation in the Central Plain.    At the
time it was expected that power facilities could be added economically
altlhough proper studies were lacking. iiy early i966 studies had been maue
which confirmed the earlier assumption and a loan for the power installation
was requested.   However, on review it was apparent that loan funds would not
be required in significant amounts until late 1969 or early 1970 and loan
consideration was deferred. In the meantime, the power market continued to
grow at a higher rate than expected and some problems began to develop in
the construction of the dam which indicated that it miglht not be completed
by the originally expected date. Consequently, bv the spring of 1969 when
tne situation was again reviewed in the field, the loan request had been
increased to cover the power installation at the dam (250 Mw) and the third
unit (310J Mw) of a new thermal plant in the Bangkok area.   The proposed
loan would be equivalent to US$46.5 million.
1.2       'TIhe loan would be made to the new autonomous power agency, the
Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT).    EGAT resulted from a
merger on May 1, 1969 of tnree power agencies, one of which, the Yanhee
Electricity Authority (YEA), was established as a condition of the Bank's
first power loan to Thailand in 1957. Since then three othier loans hiave
been Inade to YEA and the iBank has followed the development of the organiza-
tion closely and with interest, as its transition from a paper concept to a
dynamic, ilialor public utility lias been remarkable.
1.(;3     This report was prepared by E. B. Arnold on tile basis of informa-
tioni supplied by EGAT and general knowledge of the power sector gained through
periodic visits, the latest in   August 1969.

a decade of internal political stahil-ity and by policies des-igned to at-
tract foreign investment.
2.u3      The optimism of the past few years is now, however,. givinc- way
to a- more cautious appraisal of the future and in particular. the post
Vietnam war period. Present indications are for some slowing down of
economic activity, less rapicl increases in saving, a slower expansion of
exchang,e earnings and, consequent'Lv, a widening resource Rap.
2.04     'The bankc has been active in the development of Thailand's
agriculture and power sectors for many years: the first irrigation loan
dates back to 1950 and the first power loan to 1957. Tlhe most recent
irrigation loan, 514 ith of September 1967, provided OS$26 million toward
construction of thie USt70, million Phasom Dam prolect, since renamed the
Sirikit Dam. At the tinme of the loan the project was known to have multi-
purpose potential which ihas since been quantified for power through compe-
tent studies undertaken bv the YEA and its consultants, Acres, Ltd. of
Canada.
2.05      The Sirilcit- Dam project is being carried out by the Rtoval
Irrigation Department (RID).  It will provide full regulation of the Nan
River and permit second cropping of approximately 380,O0O ha of land where
in general only one crop is presently possible. The project's primary jus-
tification is for increased crop production but it will be possible without
detracting from agricultural benefits to install significant power facili-
ties at the dam. This will be done by EGAT under the proposed project.
2.ub      EGAT came into existence on May 1. 1969. It resulted from the
merg,er of the YEA, the Northeast Electricity Authority (NEEA) and the
LiAnite Authoritv (LA). Each provided bulk power generation and trans-
mission but in different parts of tile country and tiheir merger should re-
sult in s,uhst2nti2n1 economies. Tihe mnerger was made withi the Bank's apnrovai.

2. 63     In addition to EGAT which now nas sole responsibility for bulk
power generation and transmission throughout the country, there are, on
the distribution side and consequently customers of EGAT:
'Cite Mvietropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA), which is
responsible for retail distribution in Langkok and
surrounding areas; and
'h'iie Provincial iElectricity Authority (PLA), which is
responsible for distribution and, in cases where service
areas are not yet connected to LGAT facilities, for gene-
ration, throughiout the rest of tile country.
2. 09     The followring is a brief background on thie three Authiorities
which since 1,ay 1 form il'CGAT. The System Hap at the end of this report
shows the location of major existing and planned facilities.
Yanhee E'lectricity Autlhority. 'ii e YEA was establisihed in 1957 as a conldi-
tion of tihe bank's first power loan in Thailanid.  It was solely responsible
Eor -eneration and transmission in tihe central, most populated part of the
country.  Although established in 1957, it did not come into being as an
operating utility until late 1961 when it assumed responsibility for bulk
power supply to Bangkok.   Its physical plant at the end of 1968 included a
total. of 650 Mw in service and 575 Mw under construction.   Units under con-
struction will come into service durinlg the next three years. YEA also
owned extensive 230 kv and lower voltage transmission and substation facili-
ties extendinR from northern Th-ailand to the areas east and west of Bangkok.
YEA as an organization developed extremely well with good techinical and
financial, planning and alert, competent management.   Four Bank loans to-
tnlling US$83.0 million were made of wlhichi US$0.5 million remained undis-
bursed on November 30l 1969f.  Other foreign exchange financing was from the
U.S. Export-Import Bank, the Central Bank of Thailand and various supplier-
arrangedt credits. In 1968 it was estimated that mnore than 90z of all
electric energy produced in Thailand originated with YEA.
iinite Autthor ity.  'lhe LA was formed in 1960 from a predecessor agency, the
Lignite 'tIhermal Power Organization   It operated lignite mines in t'he north
(Mae Mioh) and south (Krabi).  hl'ie southern mine provides fuel for a three
unit 60 MFw steam plant from which energv is marketed over LA-owned    15 .kv
lines. 'i'biis southern operation will probably remain separated from EGAT's
othier incrli.ties for manv years because the relatively small southern mar=
ket would not justify electrical interconnection over tthe long distances
involved.  Financing Iias been through supplier credits a       ArD
Nortie-ast Electrititcty Aititirit-y.  The NEEA was for.ed in 1962 to carry out
a         aekong Basin tributary project sponsored by the U.N. Committee for Co-
ordi-ation of investi,Tations of the Lower ilek-on LBas4in.  BeLore the merger
it operated two small hydro plants with total capacitv of 31 Mw and two
15 M4w gas turbines. Lnergy is marketed over 115 kv anu lower voltage lines.

I:inancing hlas been through low interest Kreditanstalt loans and Italian
supplier credits.  Ihe NELA systenm will be tied into the YFA system in June
1970 (paragraph 2.11).
2.10      The recent merger was an excellent step toward consolidating
and rationalizing the power sector.   Itowever, there are still three Author-
ities which thougih split along logical, functional lines still report to
separate ministries, EGAT to the Ministry of National Deve-lopment and iHIEA
and PEA to the Ministry of Interior. An indefinite continuance-of this
division of authority between two ministries would be undesirable in view
of the economies which could result by bringing all thiree Authorities under
one ministry, or eventually combining them into one new Authority.   Recog-
nizing this, the Thai Government's intention is to first merge the MEA and
PEA, with the eventual goal of having one power authority for the coun-
try.  The first step could be taken at any time but tihe second will not
be rushed as it will take some time to gain the benefits of the initial
mergers.
Facilities under Construction
2.11      Included in the 575 Mw of generating capacity under-construction
by YEA on May 1, 1969 when EGAT came into existence were the sixth 70 Mw
hvdro unit at Bhumibol, the first two 200 Mw units at South Banpkok and
seven gas turbine units of 15 Mw each. In addition a third 230 kv circuit
was being erected between Bhumibol and a niaor switching station at -lakorn
Sawan, 230 km north of Bangkok, as well as the third and fourth circuits
hbp-twpen Nakorn Sawan and Bangkok. A 230 kv loop was being completed around
Bangkok and lower voltage transmission lines were being converted to hiigher
voltages or extended- as were imiany of the system's 37 substations.. A
double circuit 115 kv transmission line to connect the YEA and NEEA systems
wasc: also,nlr construrcton- 'T'he IA waq comnnltiing the third 20 Mw. unit at
the Krabi thermal station and the NEEA hiad two small hydro projects under-
2.12      The sixth Bhumibol unit will complete that installation for the
time being althoughi there is space for eight units. Reservoir inflow ihas
been less than expected with the result that the plant with six units will
operate more for peaking duty sooner than originally anticipated. Due to
a series of dry years and initial failure to properly coordinate between
power and irrigation water uses, the reservoir became critically low by
July 1969 and the power plant was operated only to meet system requirements
in excess of other system generating capability. Fortunately the August-
October 1969 monsoon produced significantly better reservior inflows than
experienced during the last few years. Consequently, though still. far
below the rule curve level, the reservoir was high enough by the. end of
1969 to remove earlier doubts about system ability to meet power market
reauirements during 1970 before the first South Bangkok unit becomes
available. Nevertheless, within limitations imposed by agricultural re-
quirements, the reservoir will continue to be drawn on only sparingly to
conserve water.

does a creditable job in meeting service requests and there is very little
unsatisfied demand in the Bangkok metropolitan area.   Hnowever, the PEA,
having a more rural and less profitable market to serve, has not moved as
fast in meeting potential market requirements.



III. TIIE PROJECT
3.01      The proposed project includes the 310 Mw third South Bangkok unit
and a power installation at Sirikit Dam consisting of two 125 Mw units plus
necessary transmission. Thle cost of these two facilities including inter-
est charges during construction but not duties is estimated at US$83.6 mil-
lion. The loan of US$46.5 million would finance the direct 11 foreign
exchange costs.
3.02      Loan 514 TH is providling financing for the construction of the
Sirikit dam, reservoir and related facilities. The principal features of
tne project include the Sirikit dan, an earthfill structure of about 9.5
million mi volume witlh maximum hieight above riverbed of about 100 m and
crest length of about 840 m, and five smaller saddle dams on low points
along the reservoir rim.  The saddle dams will be up to 35 m in height and
involve in total some 3 million m3 of fill.
3.03      The reservoir will extend about 50 km upstream and contain about
9,000 million m3 at its normal maximum operating level of elevation 160 m.
Loan 514 TH covers the foreign exchange cost of civil works by contract for
the main dam plus equipment and supplies for construction of the saddle dams
by RID force account. Two diversion tunnels will be incorporated into part
of the permanent spillway complex and in addition two power tunnels will be
excavated and a powerhouse foundation constructed under the main dam con-
struction contract. One of the spillway tunnels will have provision for
low level outlet of irrigation water. Vianini of Italy, the main dam con-
tractor, has been at work since early 1968.
3.04      Records of stream flow on the Nan River at the dam site have been
taken since December 1954 and since 1938 at Uttaradit, approximately 60 km
downstream. From these and precipitation records a reasonably reliable
estimate of river discliarges over a period of 25 years indicates an annual
average flow at the dam site of more than 7,000 million m3. The selected
reservoir capacity of 9,noo million m3 will permit tlhe storage of flows
exceeding the average, allowing them to be carried over and utilized in
th-e succeeding -ear.  This would hiave been possible in more than 40% of tile
years of simulated record.
3.05      Feasibility work for the project was done by the RID and its
consultanrts, Engineering Consultants, Irc. (EC!) of Denver.  Additionalivy
as a condition of the Loan, the RID engaged an International Board of
CLonsultants to advi1se as needed on special problemns.  EC! is resnonsihle
for all design and contract supervision and also advises the RID on work
being done by force account.  The International B1oard meets periodically,
most recently in February 1969 to review problems resulting from unexpected
geological conditions. "This review resulted in reconnuended desigr modifi-
cations to certaini project elenments, principally the spillway tunnels and

intake structure and while both increased costs and schedule extensions
are expected they do not affect the feasibility of or justification for
the proposed power installation.
3.06      YEA planning up through early 1969 had assumed the Sirikit power
installation could be completed to meet market requirements in 1973. The
next system addition was to have been the third unit at Southl Bangkok.
hlowever, thlis sequence did not allow for much slippage assuming market
growth as described in the next chapter. Therefore in view of the rela-
tively unfavorable geological conditions being encountered at Sirikit and
the need for redesign of some features of the project as recommended by
the International Board, as well as the fact that market growth continued
at a higher rate than expected, YEA decided to advance the third South
Bangkok unit. Sirikit power availability can then slip to 1974 without
endangering system reliability although its earlier completion would be
beneficial in reducing oil fuel costs.
Sirikit Power Facilities
3.07      One of the conditions of Loan 514 Til required the YEA to carry
out a study under terms of reference agreed with the Bank to show the
feasibility and benefits of a power installation at the dam. This was
done during the last half of 1967 by YEA's consultants, Acres Ltd. of
Canada, using data supplied by the Bank. RID and YEA.   It was assuimed that
irrigation demands would ihave first priority on available water and that
cropping patterns would develop as set forth in the annraisal report for
the Phasom (Sirikit) Dam Project (Report tNo. TO-563b of June 15, 1967).
The operations of the Sirikit and Bhumibol reservoirs - as controlling
the two main tributaries of the Chao Phya River from which Thailand's
central plain is irrigated - were simulated by computer and theoretical
power production determined. In brief, this indicated that a power station
at Sirikit could produce average energy of 1X000 million kt.h per year with
a firm capacity of about 400 Mw. The study showed that the provision of
power facilities at the dam plus related transmission facilities would be
justified provided that only the capital costs of the specific power
facilities were charged to the power installation-
3.08      The study concluded thiat a 4 x 125 Mw unit installation would be
justified but after review of the findings YEA and Bank staff decided that
most of the benefits could be arhieved at considerable savings with a two
unit installation initially. Although the third unit would not contribute
much ad<litional energy to the svstem it could be installed In 1975 or 1976
at low incremental cost for reserve and peaking use. The fourth unit does
not appear economically attraRtive and may never be installed although
project design does allow for this eventual possibility.
Scope ot Work
3e09      The excavation of two power tu.nnels 8.5 ri, diameter by 450 m long
is included in the project being financed by Loan 514TH. Steel lining



will, however, be a cost of the power installation. The tunnels will term-
inate at a surface powerhouse located on the right bank immediately down-
stream from the foot of the dam. Only minimum foundation work-for units
three and four will be installed and one of the power tunnels will be
blanked off. The other tunnel will feed two 125 Mw units. The switch-
yard, which will include 230 kv, 115 kv and 22 kv circuits, will be lo-
cated on fill adjacent to the powerhouse at the foot of the dam.    From
the switchyard a double circuit-steel tower-transmission line will carry
the major part of the energy to t}e existing Nakorn Sawan substation about
230 km north of Bangkok and then over existing circuits to bangkok, a
total distance of about 480 km. A 115 kv transmission line of about 55 km
will connect with Uttaradit to provide a second source of supply to a chain
of 115 kv substations presently fed from existing ECAT facilities. TCIhis
line, built for construction power supply to the dam, will require reloca-
tion of only two or three spans.
Schedule Considerations
3.10      The target date for river diversion under the existing dam con-
tract is January 1, 1970 but this will slip. Thie schedule also calls for
completion of the powerhouse foundation by March 1971 and power :tunnels
(excavation only) by June 1971. The first power unit could be on-line
about 24 months after completion of the powerhouse foundation, but the
various work items above mentioned are somewhat interdependent and it is
uncertain whether this schedule can be achiieved in view of tlhe difficult
geological conditions thus far encountered.
Operating Considerations
3.11      It is evident that the best use of the Bhumibol and Sirikit
reservoirs will depend upon close liaison between thie RID and EGAL.   While
the EGAT Act is specific in delegating the responsibility for control of
reservoirn to EGAT; it also recognizes that for maximum multipurpose bene-
fit, the RID and EGAT jointly will have to agree on water release patterns.
In case of conflict the Act nrovides that the dispute be put to the Mlinis-
ter of National Development fordecision.
3.12      In actual practice there is a basic conflict in reservoir opera-
tion between power and irrigation requirements.   Maximum benefits to EGAT
will be associated with little or no drawdown of reservoirs -to mnaintain
... aximum head, while irrigtion dem.ands will renfuire substantial drawdow-ns
during dry seasons.   The problem is to devise a method whereby for a
given volumetric release, maximum. generating capacity is retained.   This
will have to be done through carefully prepared and periodically reviewed
reservoiLr rule curves.

South Bangkok Thermal
3.13      Thailand's hydroelectric resources are limited although the Mekong
River which forms part of the international boundary with Laos has vast
potential. In the circumstances the major share of the country's electric
power needs will be supplied from thermal generation, at least until such
time as Yiekong River projects become a reality. Indigenous fuel souLrces
are scarce so present and planned thermal generation depends on imported
fuel, at present oil and by the late 1970's probably nuclear as well. The
South Bangkok station was accordingly designed by Black & Veatch Interna-
tional of Kansas City, YEA's consultants for thermal work, for hiigh effi-
ciency base load service. Present plans are for an ultimate installation
of about 1,500 Mw in five units. The first two units, both under construc-
tion, are nominally rated at 200 Mw but capable of continuous 12-1/2%
overload at reduced efficiency. They are reheat units, 1,800 psi, 1,0000/
1,000°F. The plant site fronts the Chao Phya River about 10 km southeast
(downstream) of the Port of Bangkok. The plant's output will feed directly
into the 230 kv Bangkok loop.
3.14      Firm price, lump sum bids for the first unit were solicited
internationally in mid-1967. Bids were opened in November. In addition
to firm cash prices, the bidders were required to state terms of financing
as an ontion. A 12-montli option for a second identical unit was also re-
quired. Bid response was excellent and after evaluation, award went to
Mitsub1ishi nf Janan in January 1968.  The ontion for the second unit was
exercised at the end of 1968. Financing for both units was arranged on
10-upnr tprmQ hb Mitfrithinhi_ Longer terms wnul d have hben desirable to
more nearly correspond withi the depreciable lives of the units but were
not available.    ie first unit- iR now schedupled fnr rnmmerriq1 onpratinn

carried out under EGAT and Black & Veatch aupervisioni, usina both force

conditions will be raised to 2,250 psi, 1,000 /1,000 F.   While the South
Bangkok units are large in comnparison to the size of other units in the
system, the Bhumibol reservoir with its associated 420 Mw of capacity will

that local manufacturers would be allowed to bid. For bid evaluation
EGAT would prefer to compare actual costs as they would be incurred but
doing so would give the local industry a 20-25% margin over foreign compe-
tition because of the difference on duties for raw materials as compared
to finished products. Thus for bid evaluation it was agreed that the mark-
up for duties on foreign bids would be limited to 15%. The resultant cost
will be compared to the actual cost of local procurement. Since the latter
will include duties on raw material of about 5%, the actual margin for
local manufacturers will be about 10%. If a local award is made the con-
tract will be denominated in foreign and local currencies which reasonably
reflect the costs involved.
3.19      Imported equipment for South Bangkok # 3 will be procured under
five basic contracts, go grouped as to permit wide participation in bidding.
14anufacturer 's representatives will be engaged on a per diem basis to super-
vise and work with force account labor during equipment erection.
3.20      Should the project be completed for less than the estimated cost,
the undisbursed balance of the loan would be cancelled unless there were
good grounds for applying savings to additional works.
Status of Engineering
3.21      The preparation of designs and specifications for power facilities
at Sirikit is the responsibility of Acres who will also be responsible for
supervision of construction. Bids were opened in JulY 1969 for turbines.
generators, valves and tunnel liners. Contract awards totalling about
US$5 miillion were authorized by the Bank on November 28 to hold to estab-
lished engineering/construction schedules. Bidding documents have been
issued for the main civil works. All procurement is being handled in
accordance with Bank procedures for international bidding.
3.22      Black & Veatch was given authority to start preparation of design
drawings and specifications in February 1969 when it was decided to advance
the third South Bangkok unit ahead of Sirikit.   Bid invitions are scheduled
for issue early in 1970 with contract award expected bv mid-year.   Allowing
40( monthis from contract award to commercial operation, the unit should be
in service by the fall of 1973. Field construction and supervision of the
third unit should present no problems as the personnel involved will simply
continue on from units 1 and 2.

IV. JUSTIFICATION OF PROJECT
Power Market
4.01      As mentioned earlier, the YEA service area accounted for over 90%
of electric energy production in Thailand in 1968. It is this market area
about whichi most is known and which has provided the basis for the market
forecast of EGAT. The EGAT service area is in priniciple the whole of
Thailand but in actuality is limited to those areas reached by transmission
lines. At present these include the areas from Cliiengmai in the nortil to
both sides of the Gulf of Thailand in thte south (tlhe YEA system),-the major
towns in the nortlheast extending to the Mekong River with an interconnection
to Vientiane, Laos (tlue NEEA system) and most of the major towns in the
south along the Mlalay Peninsula (the LA system).   The YEA and NEEA systems.
the central system, will be tied together by inid-1970 so they can be treated
as one, while the southern system will remain isolated.
4.02      The various market forecasts made in the past have invariably
proven to be low.   The most recent in-depth survey was the so-called Moulton
Report published in December 1966 1/ under sponsorhip of US AID. It is
probably the most comprehiensive and competent of all the studies.   It too,
at least for the two and a half years whichi have elapsed, underestimated
market growth. Updating of that report was undertaken during 1969 but
results were not available in time for this report.    Annex 2. which
was copied from YEA's 1968 Annual Report, gives a graphical representa-
tion of how some of the past forecasts compared with actual systew growth.
4.03      The growth rate has been high by any standards. averaging over
27%. per year since 1961 with annual increases of around 30% during recent
years. The more inmportant reasons. along with system iniprovements so that
uninhibited growthi could occur, lhave been the Government's efforts to en-
courage local and foreign investment witrh consenuent ind(ustrilI development
and rising standards of living, tourism, and to an indeterminate degree the
Viptnam war=   The latter has had an effect, more hec2rise nf funlds pumped
into the economy by the military presence in Thailand than by direct use
of energy by military installations, which has been ineonsequent-ial    An-
otther factor has been tihe use of sensible, straightforward rate schedules,
of the decreasing cost block rate form for residential and small business
customers with demand cliarges for industrial loads 30 kw and higher. Prior
to 1916-1 flat rates were used for the different classes ofp service except
that rates for small users had a second block higher than the first.    Annex
3, again takern f.. foVUA i 196  A n1L,.tAa- Report, show1 the d r t  of

later on. In the circumstances YEA has had to schedule capacity additions
to meet the higher expected growth but has always postponea tne decision
to start construction of a new source as long as possible. Since recent
additions hlave been thermal, a lead time of about 36 months had to be al-
lowed. Obviously if load growth slackens more abruptly than assumed, some
capacity already conmitted to contract will come into service earlier than
rpquired. But this is an unavoidable risk if reasonable system security is
be maintained. For longer range planning, mainly to establish the se-
!nce of new plant construction and maximum capital requirements, YEA used
! highier of two growth projections developed in the Moulton Report. hlow-
Nr, they used the lower projection for economic and financial analyses.
)5      Power supplies have been adequate to meet market demands only
ice 1961 when deferred demand began to be satisfied.   As a result historic
~ords of power consumption by economic sectors and industries would be of
ibtful value in estimating future demand. The Moulton Report and another
,ut the same time by a Japanese firm of consultants therefore attempted
relate market estimaates to past and expected growth of national and re-
mnal econonmic activity. The Japanese study predicted a lower growth rate
In tile Moulton study and it in turn was slightly below the 1967 and 1968
;ults. The Moulton study actually resulted in two market projections,
compiled as above from analysis of past and expected GNP and the other
relating per capita electric generation in different countries to per
pita GDP. The former gave the higher results but both were practically
!ntical through 1970.
)6      Annex 5 shiows thie market and system characteristics used in
tparing this report.  The projection is basically Moulton's adjusted for
:ual results in 1968 and the first five months of fiscal 1969.    Load growth
is far in 1969 shows no signs of tapering off, the first five montlhs of
fiscal year exceeding thie same period in 1968 by about 34%.   A 29% in-
tase is expected for the year which would be about the average for the
t few years. For the eight years 1969-1976. energy growth would average
'ut 18-1/2% annually, decreasing from 29% in 1969 to 12-1/2% in 1976.
Power demand growth would be at a slightly lower rate because of improving
load factors but nonetheless would increase from 487 Mw in 1968 to 1730 Mw
in 1976, or 3.5 times.   But it should be recognized that until the growth
rate stabilizes at more normal levels, any estimate is subject to substan-
tial uncertainties.   For thie period covered by this renort; the nurnose of
the market forecast is to give the necessary parameters for calculating
levels of investment, revenues and operating costs.    For these nurposes the
estimaate used is reasonable. Annex 6 shows the estimate and system capa-
bility to meet it in graphical form.
Estimated Econnmic Return

expected at about the tiime the units Lwould come into service. There is
no alternative to providing for this or equivalent generating capacity if



- 14 -
the assumed market conditions are to be met. The only sensible choice
for late 1973 is the third South Bangkok unit. Nothing other than gas
turbines or (diesels could be installed in time. However, neither would
normally be used for the base load service to whicih the new steam unit
would be assigned, due to their higph operating costs, among other reasons,
and they would therefore not be a practical alternative.
4.08      The 250 Mw installation at Sirikit, with necessary transmission,
is estimated to cost about US$42.8 million before duties but including con-
tingencies and interest charges during construction. This would provide
200 Mw of firm capability and an average 950 Gwh annually at the load cen-
ter. An approximate measure of the value of the investment is indicated
by the fact that the unit cost of energy would be about equal to just the
fuel cost component of thermal generation using 7% as the cost of money.
The calculation is shown in Annex 7. It would suggest that the return on
the Sirikit investment should compare favorably to that for the thiird South
Blangkok unit, which it does, as explained in the following paragraph.
4.09      The incremental returns on the two generating sources included in
the Project can be approximated by the interest rate which applied over the
life of each facility will equalize each associated cost/benefit stream.
This requires the preparation of estimates of costs, both capital and oper-
ating? as well as of benefits, whicih accrue in the form of savings in produc-
tion costs and/or in revenues from new sales priced at the average tariffs
expected to prevail. 1/ In this case the costs were easily determined but
the benefits, for example whether to allocate new generation to meet load
growth or to reduce system average generating costs, become a matter of
judgment and thie results must be viewed as indicative. Tihe calculation is
summarized in Annex 8.   The equalizing discount rnte for the Sirikit cost/
benefit stream is 19%, and for South Bangkok #3, 17%.    Both are satisfac-
tory. Since the alternative to Sirikit could only be another tliermal unit,
the results give reasonable assurance that the least-cost solution to meet-
inr, the 1973-74 market growth has been selected.
1/   The calculation is more nearly a financial return, and understates
the economic return to Thailand insofar as customers would be will-
ing to spend more for electricity than tariffs require.



V. THE BORROWER
5.01      The EGAT Act is similar in all important respects to the former
YEA Act which was in turn the product of joint efforts by Bank staff and
Thai officials.  The Act establislhes EGAT as an independent corporate entity
with a Board of Directors consisting of a Chairman and not more than 10
others including the General Manager who is an ex-officio member. The
board members, other than the General Manager, are appointed by the Council
of Ministers.  They must be of Thai nationality and be .ualified by exper-
ience in the fields of business administration, pure science, engineering,
economics, finance or law. No one holding a political post can be appointed
nor, on receiving such a post, can continue as a member. Terms are for
four years and renewable but one half of the initial members will retire
after the first two years by drawing lots, to provide continuity. The Board,
in addition to the usual corporate powers including those of authorizing
debt agreements, also enjoys the powers of expropriating properties and
setting tariffs.
5.02      In the past the YEA board confined itself to policy determina-
tions and left management to the General Manager and his staff. This was
one reason why the YEA management developed extremely well. The precedent
thus established is expected to govern the future relationship between the
Board and management of EGAT as the management is the YEA management and
the new Board contains strong personalities from the old Board.
5-03      The Minlster of National Development is charged with responsibility
for general supervision of the activities of EGAT. Matters requiring action
bh t-he Counril of Ministers are subinitted through hiTm and he is responsible
for seeing that the Council's instructions are followed.
5.04      The past Loan Agreements with YEA specified, among other things,
that reneal Or material amnendment of the YEA Act without the prior agree-
ment of the Bank would constitute a default under Section 5.02 of the Loan
Regnulations. A similar nrovision with respect to the EGAT Act is included
in the proposed Loan Agreement.
5.05      EGAT will be organized along the lines developed by YEA which in
turn resulted in part from recommendations of an extensive management sur-
vey in the early 1Q60's a.nd more recently From. advice from arrounnting con-
sultants and others.  The U.S. Federal Power Commission system of accounts
'Ls use-l. T'he organization is straightforward.  A deliberate attpmnt is
made to delegate authority to the various departments and sections and
em.ployee imorale is consequently hilgh. Dnecisions can- be and are m.ade withi
minimum lost motion.
5.06      YEA had a permianent salaried staff of over 1,600 of whic1i almost
400 were college grauuates and 3J0 highier vocatLonaL school graduates



- 16 -
when LGAT came into existence. 'Tlere were close to 2,000 additional daily
pay rate employees, some temporary as required by construction activities
and somle permanent. Orientation and training programs were regularly
scheduled.  Labor relations were good. The LA and NEE-A had about 2,100
permanent employees. EGAT thus starts withi approximately 3,700 permanent
employees. Management realizes there will be some redundancy tor the
first few years but expects to absorb the surplus effectively as system
operations expand.
Audits
5.07      The Act requires the Board to "...appoint one or more auditors
to audit and certify the accounts..." for eachi year. Accounts are closed
within 90 days and the Audit Report is required within 180 days of thie
close of each fiscal year. In the past a similar requirement for YEA was
met by using staff of the Government Audit Council under the supervision
of an independent accounting firm (Coopers & Lybrand). The direct super-
vision of the annual audit by Coopers & Lybrand was discontinued in 1966
but YEA continued to retain them as accounting advisors. As part of their
responsibilities, Coopers & Lybrand reviewed and conmmented on YEA's finan-
cial position and the Audit Council work. Their report was addressed to
the Chairman of the 'board and a copy was sent to the bank. Similar ar-
rangements will be continued and the proposed Loan Agreement includes an
appropriate covenant regarding audits.
Tariffs
5.08      EGAT can set tariffs within guidelines of the Act which stipulates
that revenues should be sufficient to:
i.   cover all operating expenses including interest,
depreciation, employee benefits and bonuses;
ii.   cover debt amortization insofar as it exceeds
depreciation. and meet increases in the cost of
asset replacement;
iii.   provide reasonable reserves and provide financing
fnr a rubhtantial pronortion of the cost of expansion.
The Act requires funds surplus after meetln- the objectives outlined above
to be turned over to the State.  Conversely, it stipulates that a defi-
ciency in meeting the ob4-tjive  wol   be cvr      by the State shoul ri
other sources of funds be unavailable. Similar provisions were in the

officials and in so doing resisted pressures for substantial rate reduc-
tions. In fact, although average rates have declined steadily througlh thLe
workings of the rate formulas, there was only one rate adjustment in the
last eiglht years. None is foreseen for the period of analysis covered Dy
tihis report although the average trend will continue downward.  The effect
of cihanging to a rate of return concept was examined during appraisal and
while lhaving considerable merit, the continuation of the present concept has
several strong points in its favor:
i.   most importantly, the contribution to construction concept,
although not quantified, has served its purpose well in the
past and the Thais are used to it;
ii.   the present stage of 1GAT existence cannot be considered
normal because of extremely high rates of load growth and
consequent levels of investment and this focuses attention
on the need to keey internal cash generation high; and,
iii.   the present need is for construction financing, as muchi
internally generated as possible, and the existing cove-
nant is designed expressly for this purpose.
5.10      Therefore during negotiations it was agreed thiat the existing
rate covenant would be continued as a condition of the proposed loan.
A target for self-financing of investment of 30% was also agreed. Dur-
ing negotiations the Government was advised of the bank's general prefer-
ence for a rate of return approach and told that in case of future lend-
ing the question would be reviewed.
Financial Situation and _listory
5.11      YEA's past financial operations far outshadowed those of the LA
and NELA. Consequently a reconstruction of the financial history for the
latter two was not attempted. Neither published reports, both operated
at loss and both suffered from an acute shortage of qualified financial
personnel. Hlowever, in preparing forecasts for EGAT, the 1968 position
for both LA and NEEA was reviewed.
5.12      Annexes 9 and 10 slhow YEA income statements and balance sheets
for the fiscal years (ending, September 30) 1965 through 1968 with projec-
tions. which were necessary in preparing proiections for EGAT, to 1976.

Annex 11
S-A ll    YEA's financial situatinn has steadily improved sinre its first
year of operations. The return on average net fixed assets in operation
increased from. about 3%7 the first vear to (Lo.3A in 196(8.  The deht/pniqity
ratio remained satisfactory, improving slightly in 1968 to 52/48. During
the past four years, operating revenue increased 2.2 times and operating
income 2.4 times. Billings were payable within 60 days and with insignifi-
cant exceptions were coll1aec-ted o.n tim4e.

Total capitalization                           4,203      100.(
Equity of 48%/ of total capitalization consisted principally of government
investment which was almost all made before YEA became an operational
entity. Included were investments to cover local currency costs of the
original Yanhee (Bhumibol) project and thie first Nortlh Bangkok thermal
unit.
5.15      Net long-term debt represented 52% of total capitalization.   The
original amounts of the loans and their purposes are shown in Annex 12.
5.16      The Baht has remained stable during the years since the first YEA
investments were made and in considering the types of investments made in
terms of practical replacement values, the degree by which the asset base
may be undervalued is insignificant. Straight-line depreciation has been
applied to conservativelv estimated asset lives.
5.17      Because neithier the LA nor NEEA kept acceptable financial records
it was doubtful during appraisal whether a starting balance sheet could be
prepared and audited prior to the nresentation of the proposed loan. I,nile
still not audited, EGAT was able to provide a provisional starting balance
sheet during negotiations.  The position is similar to that esti-lated for
the preparation of this report. Recent audited statements of YEA, by
far the largest component of EGAT, are of course available.   The effect
of consolidating their estimated financial positions with that of YEA is

Total capitalization                   5,353  +1,150         +27.4
Total capitalization has increased about one-quarter but the debt/equity
ratio remnains about the same, 53/47 compared to 52/48. Both the LA and the
NE1,A had incurred significant debt before the merger, some directly and
some through loans made to the Government in support of proiects under their
jurisdications. During appraisal of the project it was not possible to get
satisfactory information from the LA or the NEEA about terms for some of
the government incurred debt but the Ministry of Finance was able to provide
terms of all debt obligations which it considered the obligations of either.
These debts have been treated as an obligation of EGAT.



VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
6.01       Projected income statements, balance sheets and sources and
applications of funds for EGAT are shown for the fiscal years 1969 thlrougl
1976 by Annexes 13, 14 and 15 respectively.
6.02       During construction of the project proposed for a Bank loan LGA'1
will be completing existing projects and starting new ones and during the
eight years covered by the projections total construction investments in-
cluding interest capitalized and duties would amount to about US$471 million.
About US$332 million would be spent during the five years 1970 through 1974,
the approximate construction period of the Project, and of this, about US$92
million would represent Project investments.

Internal cash generation after meeting bonus payments and debt service would

requirements during the Project period and about 36% over the whole period.



The balance would be covered by borrowings, leaving a sizeable cash margin
which is WeIl Justified.   Import duties are covered by tne financing plan
but profits taxes are not. Treatment of profits taxes is discussed in
par araph 6.06.
6.04      Forecast long-term debt woula include:
i.   the remiain-ing small undisbursed balance of Loan 489 Th
and a Central Bank loan.   These were at 6% and 5-1/2'/
respectively,
ii.   the draw-down of supplier arranged credits in force as
of May 1, 1969. These were at interest rates varying
between 5-1/2% and 6% with 10 year repayment, in m:in-
cases after a suitable grace period;
iii.   the draw-down of local currency loans in force as of
May 1, 1969. These were all with the Ministry of Finance
at 5-1/2% to 6%, 10 year repayment after 5 years of grace;
iv.   the proposed Bank loan of US$46.5 million equivalent,
assumed to be at 7% for a term of 20 years including
5 years of grace;
v.   a series of annual loans which the Government advances
to cover payment of import duties. These are assumed to
be at 6% with 10 years repayment after 5 years of grace,
terms which apply at present;
vi.   a series of additional loans as needed to balance
the projected financial requirements. These were
all assumed to be at 7%.
The future loans required under item vi. would total about US$173 million
equivalent over the period of forecast and although sources are not pres-
ently known, it is reasonable to expect that they would be, as in the past,
from the Ministry of Fin.unce and/or-the Central Bank, from suppliers and
from the Bank. The terms assumed are reasonable for purposes of forecast.
6.05      Import duties and taxes of about 22% 1/ are paid on imported
equipment for approved projects.   About 30% is paid on spare parts.   These
costs have been, and are assumed to continue to be, financed through gov-
erminent loans with terms as mentioned above. Additionally, duty and taxes
of about 39% are paid on fuel but these are covered as anoperating ex-
pense.
Income Tax
6.06      In 1965 the Council of Ministers resolved that all State Enter-
prises should pay the equivalent of the corporate income tax which would
l/   During negotiations tile Bank was advised that duties would be re-
duced significantly for major projects.



apply if such Enterprises were liable for such tax. This is equivalent
to about 25% of net profit. Neither the LA nor the NEEA ever incurred
this tax but the YEA has incurred tax from fiscal 1965, amounting to $152
million by the end of fiscal 1968.   Payment was deferred but no formal
arrangements for deferral in the future were made nor was there a sciledule
for payment of the deferred amount. Interest at 6% was paid on the ac-
cumulated amount deferred.   Wlile the payment of interest in this amount
caused no particular problem, the amounts deferred    - if the present ar-
rangement was continued - would increase to the extent that borrowings
of about US$13.5 million equivalent additional to those assumed would
be required to cover interest on deferred taxes luring the forecast period.
Payment of the tax itself would be beyond EGAT's financial capabilities.
6.07      The EGAT Act sets fortli a philosophy governing revenues and
provides that funds excess to the stated objectives be turned over to
the State.  There is nothing in the Act about payment of income tax and
to superimpose this condition would make it imapossible to achieve the
stated revenue objectives without a rate increase, sometlhing neithier the
Government nor EGAT wants. On the other hand, the continued accumula-
tion of unpaid taxes was unnecessarily distorting the balance sheet.
This illogical situation was discussed with thie Government in prepara-
tion for negotiations.   The Bank suggested that a rational, permanent
solution should be found. After considerable debate in Bangkok, the
Governmlent proposed as an interim measure to eliminate 1/ income tax
as applying to EGAT for a period of seven years (1970-76), with the
understanding that the situation would be further reviewed with the
aim of arriving at a permenent position to apply after 1976.    The
present accumulated amount deferred would be amortized over 15 years at
6%.  This proposal was accepted during negotiations.
Bonus Payments
6.08      Bonuses are paid to Directors and staff annually in accordance
with resolutions by the Council of Ministers which govern all State Enter-
prises. In the case of the Board this amounts to 2% of net profit or the
equivalent of about US$2,000 for thle Chairman and US$1,600 for each Director,
whichever is lower, and for staff, 5% of net profit up to the maximum equiv-
alent of four months salary. The amount of the bonus can be relatively
significant ancl the incentive thus provided gives every employee a personal
interest in the profitability of the company.    Allowance for bonus Dayments
has hben mnnde -in the_ financial nroiectfonr.
W1rL-ino Cnnitnl K12P,irPrnPnt-lQ

the next beconies significant; inventories must also increase due to expana-
ing operations and the errect or these two items represents a use of funds.
Wihile accounts payable also increase, they do not compensate for the first
two items. Analysis of past records indicates that accounts payable approxi-
mate 35% of annual fuel cost and accounts receivable 20% of annual billings.
Inventories amount to about 25% of operating costs before depreciation.
Therefore, to provide an adequate level of workin, capital in the financing
plan, an allowance equivalent to about US$18.5 million thirough 1976 has been
made using the above parameters.
6.10      The most significant item of operating cost is the cost of fuel,
whichi is high in Tllailand. 'The price paid by EGAT is equivalent to about
US 56.2¢ per million btu including taxes and duty of about 39% on landed
price. The measures presently being taken to conserve water (paragraph
2.12) will sharply increase fuel costs during the next few years and
proper allowance for this has been made in the projections. Other operat-
ing costs are projected in accord withl past experience for which good
records exist.
Future Capital Investments
6.11      In addition to the Project and the completion of work now underway,
allowance has been made in the financial projections for the cost of other
plant additions which will be required to meet the assumed growth of the
market. Included are funds for the third unit at Sirikit, the Quae Yai
project, a nuclear plant and/or the fourth unit at South Bangkok plus
miscellaneous system additions. These projects or similar ones will not
all come into service during the period of projection but construction will
be underway. The next project for whichi Bank financing will probably be
requested is the Quae Yai. As presently conceived it would be a multipurpose
project having significant power and irrigation benefits, the irrigation
features complementing and continuing those of the Me Klong Irrigation
Proiect which was partly financed by Loan 394 TH in 1964. An adeauate
level of expenditures on new plant has been provided for in the projections.
Estimate(I Financial Position
6.12      During the period of forecast the return on average net fixed
assets in operation would range between 7.7% and 13.4%.; with a generallv
rising trend (Annex 13), the debt/equity ratio from a high of 60/40 in
1972 to 49/51 in 1976 (Annex 14) and debt Rervice covprage hetween 1.3
times in 1970 to 1.7 times in 1976 (Annex 15). These ratios are satis-

for capital expansion. The projections provide a realistic basis for judg-
ing the future financial position.
Debt Control
6.13      The past loans to YEA all contained covenants requiring Bank
approval before incurrence of debt other than debt associated with Bank
projects. There was good reason for this in the early years but as opera-
tions have expanded Bank review of each proposed debt-arrangement be-
came cumbersome.  Calculations showed that because of the rapid rate of
expansion being experienced, the traditional earnings test would not
apply. Nevertheless, there should be some-control over EGAT's long-
term debt. Therefore, EGAT agreed during negotiations that it would
not borrow in excess of US$20 million in any given year without- Bank
approval. Bank approval would also be-required for borrowiings on 5-
year or shorter terms which would cause the total of such debt;out-
standing to exceed US$5 million.

VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED DURING NEGOTIATIONS
7.01      The proposed Project provides a sound basis for a loan of US$46.5
million equivalent, for a term of 20 years including a 5-year grace period.
7.02      During negotiations agreement was reached that:
i.   the EGAT Act would not be materially changed witlhout
the Bank's prior approval (paragraph 5.04);
ii.   annual audits would continue to be made under arrange-
ments satisfactory to the Bank (paragraph 5.07);
iii.   rates would continue to be set at such levels as to
cover all operating costs including interest, depre-
ciation or amortization of debt whichever is greater,
welfare and bonus payments and to provide an average
of 30% of the cost of necessary expansion. (paragraph 5.10);
iv.   income tax would not be charged for a neriod of seven
years (paragraph 6.07); and
v.   borrowings in excess of defined limits would not be
undertaken without Bank approval (naragraph 6.13)

Economic Considerations
The method followed in determining the approximate economic
return on the two generating sources comprising the Project consists
of discount-Ing each cost/benefit stream to find the rate at which the
present value of each stream becomes zero. The calculation involves
the followi.ng considerations:
Costs
i.  Capital investments net of interest during construction
and of duties.
ii.  Operating and maintenance costs inclulding insurance,
interim replacements (but not depreciation) and thermal
fuel.
iii. It was assumed that the thermal unit would be base loaded
as soon as it came on the line (86- plant factor) and
would so remain for the first 5 years of its life. It
would then gradually move higher under the load curve so
that its average plant factor over its expected 30-year
life would end up at 55h. All system hydro energy
including that in the Project was assumed to be used
under the load curve throughout its entire life of
50 years.
iv.  Fuel was priced at US$.L05/million btu, the present cost
exclusive of duties and taxes. Net thermal heat rate was
assuried to decline from 9,100 btu/kwii during the first
5 years to ';,,500 btu/kwh by the 11th year.
Benefits
I.  Revenues attributable to new sales from each plant were
valued at k0.28/kwh, the average realization expected i.n
the late 1970's.
ii.  Increased sales, one year to the next, were apportioned
to the two plants on approximately a 50/50 basis. This
quickly used up all hydro energy (950 CGwh annually); the
thernal unit being larger than the hydro installation
and operating at a much higher plant factor (2,400 Gwh
annually) produces additional energv that was used to
displace less efficient generation.  The saving assumed
was equivalent to 500 btu/kwh.  By the 6th vpar and
thereafter all thermal energy was valued at the market rate.
The two cost/benefit streams are shown on page 2.  The equalizing

1/ For appraisal it was assumed that EGAT would pay profits taxes as due and thaLt the
Government would invest like anounts as equity.    However, during negotiations (paragraph 6.07)
it was agreed that EGAT wiould be exempt from such taxation during the period 1970-76.     The net
effect to the balance sheet is minimal as total equity will stay the same, building up through
the earned surplus accourt instead of the Thai Government investment account.
