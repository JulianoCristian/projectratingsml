improvement or strengthening of about 700 km\n            of rural roads in Bihar, and the improvement of routine and\n            periodic road maintenance, which would permit all-weather\n            transport between farms and markets and facilitate rural\n            development. Potential risks include the early deterioration\n            of project roads as a result of flooding and inadequate\n            maintenance, and a delay in the realization of agricultural\n            benefits. These risks would be minimized by the\n            implementation of improved construction and maintenance\n            standards and by ensuring that road construction and\n            improvement works are carried out only where complementary\n            investments take place."}, "docdt": "1980-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
