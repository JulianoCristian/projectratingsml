Ecosystem Management Project for Burkina Faso were as\n            follows: outcome was moderately satisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was high; Bank performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory; and borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Lessons learned include: protected\n            area projects supported by the World Bank need to ensure\n            that other means of finance, apart from the Global\n            Environment Facility (GEF), are woven into the project\n            design in case contingency resources are needed to ensure\n            that negative impacts on human livelihoods are mitigated.\n            Projects with small grants programs typically indicate that\n            since the activities will be chosen downstream,\n            environmental management plans (EMPs) will need to be\n            designed at the time when activities are selected, and that\n            the management plans must be designed in consultation with\n            the beneficiaries. The project level EMP is often modeled as\n            a framework process that provides guidelines on how to\n            develop EMPs at the site or activity level. Guidelines\n            include information concerning Bank standards on\n            participation and inclusion, conflict resolution, monitoring\n            and evaluation. However, for this system to be effectively\n            implemented, adequate and upfront assessment is needed of\n            environmental impact assessment (EIA) capacity at the\n            village and inter-village level, including both capacity for\n            assessment and capacity to mitigate harm (technical and\n            financial capacity)."}, "docdt": "2010-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
