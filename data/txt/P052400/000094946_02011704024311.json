These issues, and\n            mitigation measures are summarized as follows: 1) An\n            interactive, participatory approach will be defined for the\n            preparation of management plans to reduce the risk of\n            revenue losses resulting from activity transfers. 2) Based\n            on the institutional framework of the Ministry of the\n            Environment and Water - through its coordinating units on\n            wildlife conservation, natural resources management, and\n            forestry preservation - the establishment of partnerships\n            with local community groups, will support agricultural\n            development, appropriate management of forest resources, and\n            livestock activities, on a contractual basis, aimed at\n            minimizing adversity on the livelihoods of local\n            populations. 3) Regarding grazing, and livestock management,\n            particularly concerning nomad groups, management plans will\n            address key issues, namely, grazing, and livestock\n            activities will be transferred to other zones, based on\n            concerted agreement with affected populations, aiming at\n            preserving their livelihoods, and standard of living. 4) The\n            risk of increased poverty on vulnerable groups, e.g.,\n            resulting from limited access to forestry resources, calls\n            for immediate action, whereby the project will support\n            micro-activities to access new resources, and training, to\n            reduce their vulnerability. 5) Grievance mechanisms, and\n            monitoring and evaluation practices, based on public\n            consultations, will ensure compliance with key social indicators."}, "docdt": "2001-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
