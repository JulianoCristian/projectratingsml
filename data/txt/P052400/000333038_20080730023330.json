     follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: conservation\n            objectives cannot be dissociated from poverty\n            reduction/local development activities. The decision during\n            project implementation to support revenue generating and\n            other local development activities in addition to\n            conservation activities, and the good results that followed\n            this decision demonstrate that conservation alone does not\n            provide enough incentives to communities to engage in\n            sustainable natural resource management. Alternative natural\n            resource-based income generating activities and other local\n            development activities which exploit territorial assets need\n            to accompany conservation activities to reduce the pressure\n            of local communities on natural resources and increase their\n            incentive in engaging in sustainable management of natural\n            resources. Securing biodiversity conservation is a long term\n            process ecological restoration, capacity building and\n            achieving financial sustainability require time. A 5-6 year\n            project is not sufficient to secure biodiversity\n            conservation; it is necessary to plan and keep a medium-long\n            term engagement (10-15 years). An adaptable program lending\n            (APL) can be an adequate instrument, if financial commitment\n            is kept. If a long-term engagement is not possible,\n            sustainable achievement of objectives is at risk. The use of\n            a single currency for a grant makes the funds less reliable.\n            The overall depreciation of the dollar in the five years of\n            project implementation was one of the factors that created\n            most problems in implementation. The use of a basket of\n            currencies for the grant may reduce the risk of depreciation."}, "docdt": "2008-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
