VENEZUELA
JUDICIAL INFRASTRUCT-URE PROJECT (JIP)
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMArRY
Borrower:             Republica de Venezuela
Beneficiary:          Consejo de la Judicatura (The Judicial Council)
Amount:               US$30.0 million equivalent
Terms:                Fifteen years including a five-year grace period, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate.
Project
Objectives:          The project aims to improve Venezuela's enabling environment for private
sector development and reduce both the private and social costs of justice. It
would: (a) improve efficiency in the allocation of resources within the
judiciary; (b) increase courtroom prodt'ctivity and efficiency; and (c) reduce
the private sector costs of dispute resolution.
Pro-eect
DescriDtion:         To achieve these objectives the project would support institutional
development of the courts and of the Judicial Council, which is responsible for
overall court administration, as follows:  (a) strengthen the planning,
budgeting, and management capacity of the Judicial Council, including the
design and implementation of an information system to provide quantifiable
performance indicators (US$5.3 million); (b) improve courtroom productivity
and efficiency through reorganization and streamlining courtroom
administrative procedures, including automation of caseload and courtroom
management (US$19.7 million); (c) strengthen the administrative capacity and
specialized legal knowledge of court personnel, including knowledge pertinent
to commercial and business litigation, by strengthening the capacity of the
Judicial School to design and deliver training (US$5.3 million); and (d)
rehabilitate existing and construct new courtroom facilities (US$25.4 million).
Benefits and Risks:   The project is expected to increase courtroom productivity and efficiency and,
thereby, reduce the private sector and individual costs of dispute resolution.
The major risks stem from the level of available budgetary resources, lack of
managerial capacity, change in policy direction to the project by the Judicial
Council, and possible lack of cooperation on the part of judges responsible for
implementation at the courtroom level. The budgetary risks would be
mitigated by Government agreement to a long-term investment and
expenditure program for institutional development of the courts, which would
be monitored under the Project. Future savings in personnel costs resulting
from automation would also reduce budgetary pressures.  The lack of
managerial capacity on the part of the Judicial Council and the courts would
be mitigated by the project's institutional strengthening programs and through
development of a strong project implementation unit. Possible change in the
Judicial Council's policy direction to the project is minimized by the long-term
appointments of Council members, who uniformly give strong support to the



project. The cooperation of judges will be sought through training and a
phased implementation plan, which will demonstrate the gains to court
personnel from administrative reorganization and automation.

I. TIIE.I ICIAL SECTOR
A. The Macro-Economic Environment
1.1    Since President Carlos Andres Perez took office in February 1989, his Government has pursued
fund. nentally new economic policies in order to resolve the economic crisis corfronting the nation. The
crisis was ti;. direct result of inappropriate economic policies followed by the Government of Venezuela
(GOV) during the previous 15 years. These policies included investment in inefficient state-owned
enterprises, inward-oriented economic policies with high protective tariffs, neglect of infrastructure
maintenance, price controls, and poorly targeted programs to ameliorate poverty.
1.2   In 1989 the new government immediately initiated a sweeping program of reforms not only to
correct the crisis at hand, but to redefine the role of the state. The essential aim of this radical, but long
overdue, economic reform and restructuring program was to reduce the elaborate regulatory framework
and complex, costly subsidies which pervaded the economy. Simultaneously, private sector activity and
investment was encouraged through tra. - reforms, financial sector reforms, the establishment of a
favorable investment climate, and the establishment of integrated and well-targeted social programs.
1.3    Specific changes included: replacing the mrultiple exchange rate system by a unified market
determined exchange rate system (under which the bolivar immediately depreciated to about Bs 36 per
US$1.00, compared to the previous off icial rate of Bs 14 per US$1.00); rationalizing and liberalizing the
trade regime, by reducing tariffs and the coverage of quantitative restrictions, and eliminating
exonerations of tariffs; allowing most interest rates to be determined by market forces, which led to a
substantial increase in deposits and most lending rates; increasing the prices for petroleum products in
the domestic market and for most public utilities; dismantling most of the domestic price control system;
and curtailing fiscal expenditures.
1.4    The economic program reduced major imbalances in less than a year. The overall deficit of the
consolidated, non-financial public sector declined from 9.4 percent of GDP in 1988 to 1.4 percent in
1989. External performance was also strong: the current account balance shifted from a deficit of ten
percent of GDP in 1988 to a surplus of five percent in 1989. This surplus was the result of a 25 percent
increase in oil prices, a one-time surge of 47 percent in non-oil exports (due to the domestic recession,
the strong bolivar, and tie 30 percent export subsidy) and a 39 percent decline in imports (due to the
devaluation of the bolivar and recession).
1.5    The short-run cost of correcting these imbalances has been high. In 1989, GDP declined by 8.6
percent, and investment by 53 percent. GDP per capita fell from US$3,230 in 1988 to US$2,450 in 1989.
This was the result of: (1) reduction in the fiscal deficit; (2) reduction in inventories, which had
increased in 1988 in anticipation of devaluation and decontrol of prices; (3) significant real devaluation
and major increases in prices of raw materials; and (4) the sluggish response of private sector investment
to the new policy environment.
1.6    The costs of adjustment fell unevenly on the population. The high costs of the reform measures
in terms of slower growth and higher inflation have caused shifts in real income among the various
groups of society with the severest impacts on the poorest groups. The contractionary policies followed
by the GOV during the stabilization period have caused economic dislocation and high unemployment.
1 7    Tne Bank's Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) and Trade Policy Loan, approved by the Board
in June 1989, have directly supported the GOV's economic reform program. These were the first two
Bank loans for Venezuela since 1974, and represent the start of a new assistance program. Three loans
were approved in FY90: a Financial Sector Loan, a Public Enterprise Reform Loan and a Technical



- 2 -
Assistance for Prenvestment Loan. In FY91 the Bank approved a Social Development Project. Having
completed significant steps toward a macroeconomic policy environment supportive of sustainable growth,
the GOV is now turning its attention to the sectoral, institutional, and legal reforms necessary to support
the supply response to the macroeconomic adjustment program. The proposed Judicial Infrastructure
Project will significantly contribute to macroeconomnic adjustment and improvement in the private sector
enabling environment by reriioving obstacles to the enforcement of legal reforms, especially contractual
obligations.
B. The Judicial Sector
An Overview
1.8    The Venezuelan judiciary lacks both public credibility and efficiency. A recent public opinion
poll found only 7 percent of - , population have confidence in the highest court of the land, the Supreme
Court.  Newspapers publish stories regarding corruption and political influence, appearances of
impropriety and delays in the judicial system. This crisis is in part the result of a lack of political will
on the part of political leaders to address growing problems in the judiciary. Only recently have the
major political parties and their members in the executive and legislative branches of Government reached
consensus on the need for and direction of reform efforts. There now appears to be a broad consensus
in both Government and the private sector regarding judicial problems and the urgent need for their
solution.
1.9    F^-ir institutions comprise the
Venezuelan judicial sector: the Supreme
Court, the Attorney General (Fiscalia
General de la Republica', the Ministry of            GOVERNANCE OF THE COURTS
Justice (Ministerio de Justicia), and the
Judicial Council. The Supreme Court is
the court of last appeal. The Attorney          S                            JUDICIAL
General provides opinions to the courts       wURT                           CC^7I]
regarding the prosecution of penal cases
and acts as public ombudsman to bring to
the  attention  of  proper  authorities
misconduct  of  public  employees
(including judges), violations of the     |                             I
Constitutional  or  human  rights  of
prisoners, and failure of courts to comply
with  legal  requirements  regarding                    TRl.% COURS
processing and disposition of cases. The                  C35 _           ..............i
Ministry of Justice manages the prisons
and  national police force, which  is                      l
responsible for formally filing complaints           DISTRICT & DEPT. RTS
with the penal courts.  The Judicial                      C2I
Council is responsible for administering
the system  of 1085 courts, including
selecting and training judges, monitoring           1NCPA 6 PA L COURS               ...
court performance,  and  undertaking        [I                IO

personnel; it enjoys significant autonomy
to undertake organizational or
administrative measures to improve court Box 1
performance  and  is  the  principle
beneficiary of this project.

1.10    In addition to the Supreme Court (Corte Suprema de Ji;sticia) with its fifteen magistrates serving
nine year terms, Venezuela has 1085 lower level courts, 14 percent being superior or appeal courts
(tribunales de segunda instancia), 32 percent being trial courts (tribunales de primera instancia), and the
remaining 54 percent being district and municipal courts (see Box 1). The trial and appeal courts are
almost equally divided between those dealing with civil (46 percent) and penal (54 percent) matters.
Fully 20 percent of all courts are located in Caracas alone, and 60 percent of all courts are located in
major urban areas.

1.11   While Government expenditures on the courts has continued to increase in real terms over the
past two decades, it has not kept pace with demand . While the number of judges increased 24 percent
between 1971 and 1991, the ratio of judges to population decreased by 29 percent. Furthermore, despite
increasing productivity (cases per court) among both civil and penal courts, increased demand for court
services has led to dramatic increases in time to resolve cases and a growing backlog. The backlog at
the trial court level has increased by a factor of fiv, (Box 2) over a five year period, with the time to
process a civil case averaging 783 working days, 4.4 times the legal requirement, and the time to process
a penal case averaging 1136 working days, 10.4 times the legal requirement.
1.12   These figures reflect a variety of causes, discussed in more detail below. Ore important cause
is the decreasing share of the Government budget (Box 3) allocated to the judiciary. Judicial spending
in Venezuela would appear low both in absolute and relative terms (e.g., Costa Rica allocates six percent
of its budget to its judicial sector compared to Venezuela's one percent). Consequences of the failure to
adequately invest in the judiciary and, especially, the civil and penal courts include insufficient supplies,
trainirng, facilities and legal and legislative information to court personnel; the number of staff is adequate
and could be reduced through automation.
1.13   The result has been delays .d backlogs which have reduced public credibility in the courts,
increased resolution of disputes through other means, and increased recognition on the part of the
Government that both reforms and additional resources are required; arbitration of commercial dispute
is costly (8 percent of settlements), confined to large disputes, and seldom used. Reform efforts have
been led by the Commission to Reform the State (COPRE) and have primarily focused on means to
reduce political influence in the courts through changes in appointment procedures and longer office
terms.  Con"ress is currently considering this proposal as well as a proposed comprehensive
Constitutional reform, which includes the appointment of a Magistrate's Council to develop lists of
qualified candidates for Supreme Court appointments, an attempt to depoliticize such appointments.
Reform efforts received added impetus from the February 1992 coup attempt, which focused attention
on issues of corruption, including alleged corruption in the judiciary.
1.14   The Venezuelan judiciary is in crisis. The penal and civil courts are encountering serious case
backlogs, procedural congestion, and judicial delays with the resulting effect of inefficient, costly and
detrimental delivery of judicial services. These delays contribute to the appearance of impropriety and
public perceptions that the courts are unresponsive, corrupt, and politically-influenced. The lack of proper
court administration is reflected in archaic procedures, inadequate control mechanisms, duplication of
effort, poor records management, weak administrative and logistical support to the judges and inadequate
judicial statistics which fail to provide a complete picture of the problems and are of little use for
improved court management and planning.
Economic Consequences
1.15   An efficient and effective court system is essential to protect property rights and guarantee
recourse to effective dispute settlement. The efficiency of courts has wide-ranging implications for the
calculation of risk in doing business, securing assets, collecting payments due, protecting private
property, gaining access to information, and enforcing contracts. Judicial inefficiency reduces fairness,
is costly, and negatively effects economic growth by raising the transaction costs of doing business. In
particular, financial institutions need to have effective means to enforce their rights, protect assets, and
recover bad debts. Two positive outcomes of improved judicial administration are increased equity in
access to credit, and increased potuntial collateral which may lead to larger economic investment.
1.16 The judicial process is necessary for upholding business contracts and bank loans. If contracts
are not easily enforceable, they hold no real value and the transaction costs of doing business are raised
because businesses will have to seek alternative contractual arrangements, including reliance on personal



-5.
relationships, which may restrict competition and increase factor costs. A slcw.judicial system increaseg
the costs of litigation, with far reaching consequences foi busiiiess and economic development.
1.17   When the judicial processes for repossessing collateral are- slow, the value of assets with shorter
economic lives for collateral i.; limited. As a result banks often only accept urban real estate rather than
other assets as collateral. This result not only reduces investment by limiting credit, but is also inequitable
since only land-owners can receive credit. This reinforces a system of narrowly distributed real wealth.
Private credit sources extend less credit than they would if loans could be socured with other forms of
collateral: vehicles, machinery, equipment, inventories, livestock, crops, or intellectual property rights.
No credit is available for "human wealth" because in,oume alone will not serve as collateral. Small
businesses and farmers cannot expand or increase productivity because they have no real access to credit
in the formal sector, while rates for borrowing in the irnformal sector are very high. Finally, restrictions
on collateral can deprive lenders and borrowers of t.., ue process of law, as they move outside the legal
system to make economically-efficient contracts.
1.18   Foreign investment may also be discouraged by an inefficient system of justice which imposes
high transaction costs, is unpredictable, and is difficult to understand. Investnent is attracted to
environments where the rules are clear and the transaction costs for erforcing them are low. For example,
in a recent survey, general counsels of some of the largest companies operating in Venezuela cited
judicial delays and unpredictable outcomes as major problems facing business. According to the survey
(conducted by CONAPRI, an association of private and public corporations) these conditions contribute
to a negative business environment that discourages investment.
'.19   To the eAtent the judicial system of Venezuela continues to be perceived as corrupt and fraught
with delay, the foreign investor and citizens alike are at risk. If the judicial system cannot guarantee
property rights and impartial settings to hear cases, due process under law is denied, especially for
citizens from the lowest socioeconomic strata. Timeliness ofajudicial system is closely related to justice,
for a slow judicial system is necessarily an unfair one. When the costs in terms of time and effort of
bringing a case to court are very high, those who have been wrongfully treated will not pursue legal
retribution. Others may be wrongly accused, but will have difficultly clearing their names. Some may
spend long periods in jail before sentencing is given. In addition, when systems are inefficient, those who
depend on the system for their well-being have a strong incentive to find alternative ways of doing things.
One is the use of the informal sector which tends to have high transaction costs since no laws apply, and
no guarantees exist. The other is the use of bribes to move the process faster. An efficient and fair
judicial system reduces these incentives and improves the transparency of operations.
C. judicial Administration
Judicial Council
1.20   Background.  The administration of the judicial system  of Venezuela was until 1970 the
responsibility of the Supreme Court, tht. arrangement typically found in Latin America. In that year, the
Judicial Council was created to administer all courts excepting the Supreme Court and the military courts.
The Council appoints, evaluates, and disciplines judges; employs and remunerates other court employees;
collects and processes statistics on court activity; negotiates an annual budget with the Presidential Budget
Office (OCEPRE) and the Congress; contracts for the material and supplies required by the courts; and
plans infrastructure investment in conjunction with the Ministry of Urban Development (MINDUR) ar,d
the state governments. As shown in Box 4, the Council is respor.sible for 41 percent of total judicial
resources, or US$ 93 million.

,inprk.ved the plan in December 1991. Since
ten additional administrative steps have been                        4tl
tflen by the Council such as the recruitment    l                                         J

Box 4
i.22   Some   of  the   administrative
C ccomplishments since December 1991 are: an initial plan for improvement was developed; a personnel
c l4ssification system was completed; a pilot automation program was developed; the position of regional
chief judges (juez rectores) was created; 32 judges were removed from office, the judicial schooi was
i eestablished; regional training programs were developed; thirty temporary judgeships % r.e created to
aisist with the reduction of delay in those courts having the most seriou: problem; and, perhaps most
iMportrntly, a process to improve the system was initiated. This sample of affirmative steps taken to
v!:iprove the system reflects the commitment of the Council to achieve real changes in the system.
..23   The Council is in a period of change and new initiatives. Almost all of the major offices are
directed by managers who are new to their positions and to the judicial sector. As a group they are well
qualified in their respective areas. The magistrates of the Cuuncil have taken several forward looking
actions such as adopting a long-term plan to decentralize operations and strengthen administrative
capacity. The confluence of an enlightened policy making body and qualified professional leaders suggest
that the Council has the institutional capacity to implement important changes and manage this important
initiative. The governing law (Ley Organica del Consejo de la Judicatura) of the Council gives it
substantial authority and responsibility to make the administrative and organizational decisions required
to irnplement reforms in court administration.
1.24      Problems. Despite recent progress, a number of important issues remain to be resolved. The
rmuraion policies of judges require improvement. Remuneration is tied to specific positions in the
civil service, with no consideration given to incomes earned by lawyers in private prac+ice. For example,
a Superior Court judge earns the same as a sector director general in the civil service but significantly
less than the partner of a major law firm. A revised remuneration policy would be especially important
if court fees, a major source of income for some -dicial personnel, were eliminated as part of the current
reform effort. Inadeguate recurrent court budgets hinder court productivity and efficiency. Budgeting
standards for supplies and maintenance need to be developed and adhered to in the annual budget
exercise. There is a lack of administrative coordination in thc Judicial Council itself, due to the tradition
of assigning each magistrate on the Council responsibility for overseeing a particular management
tunction. This problem is especially serious given the lack of continuity resulting from changes in the
five magistrates comprising the management of the Council; magistrates are appointed for a renewable
term of four years, and the Presidency rotates among the members every two years. There is excessive
rniphasis on control and inadequate emphasis on technical assistance to the courts, particularly as regards
ate work of the Council's inspectors. Their role should be altered to monitor court activities and statistics
and to trouble-shoot specific court problems.



- 7-
1.25    Administrative and policymaking decisions of the Council suffer from  weak management
information and court statistics. Information systems neea to be developed for personnel, finance,
physical infrastructure, and inspectorate and auditing functions. The single most critical need is reliable
and timely statistics on each court's workload, activity, and performance. These data and their analysis
should be collected annually and reviewed to improve the transparency and accountability of the system.
The various management functions of the Council also suffer from weak management skills, especially
at the mid-management level, and the Council lacks a training plan and program to address the problem.
Extensive training is required to improve staff skills in human resource administration, planning and
analysis, financial management and auditing, and the collection and reporting of court statistics. An
additional difficulty is the absence of norms and standards for a wide range of Council and court
activities. lTe establishmen. and dissemination of standards for personnel evaluation, purchasing,
courtroom design, legal forms, etc., is an appropriate responsibility of the Judicial Council.
1.26   The Council's administrative decentralization policy and implementing measures are still
undefined, although a judicial delegate (juez rector) was recently (January 1992) established for each of
the country's nineteen regions. To be successful, decentralization will require significant strengthening
of the regional offices. Finally, there is inadequate involvement of trial court judges in the development
of trial court related policies. The Council should :egularly appoint committees of judges to work with
Council staff to study issues and make recommendations to the plenarid. This would both inform policy
decisions and ensure their more effective acceptance and implementation.
Court Adminirtration
1.27   Legal cases in Venezuela are mostly tried through the use of written case materials; this makes
the control and management of case files extremely important. For example, the processing of a criminal
case begins with a complaint to the police, who are then responsible for formally filing charges with an
investigative judge juez de instruccion). The judge receives written testimony from plaintiffs and
defendants and sends the written findings on the case to the attorney general's (Fiscalia General) office
for an opinion as to whether charges should be pressed. The attorney general sends the case with an
accompanying opinion back to the judge for sentencing. The law establishes minimum times for each
step of case processing, but these requirements are neither monitored nor enforced consistently.
1.28   In carrying out the work of the court, each judge has a secretariat comprised of an executive
secretary (secretario), bailiff (aguacil), file clerks, and from 5-15 legal assistants (escribientes), most of
whom are law students working to gain 1-2 years experience prior to graduation. Court statistics on case
processing are unreliable, especially for civil courts. However, based on available data for 1990, the
average penal trial court receives 675 new cases per year, has three to seven thousand cases in process
with all the associatea paperwork, and reaches decisions on 120 cases. An average civil trial court
receives 3100 new cases per year, has six to nine thousand cases in process and reaches decisions on 1650
cases. The sheer magnitude of cases in the courts presents a difficult management problem, especially
when all case management is done manually.
1.29   Delays and Backlogs. Caseloads are increasing at a rapid rate among all levels and types of
courts in Venezuela, while the number of judges per capita has declined leading to a growing gap between
cases initiated and concluded (Box 5). This increasing congestion of the courts is reflected in long delays
in case processing. A review of a random sample of cases in Caracas courts found that almost all cases
exceeded legal processing time standards. In criminal cases, the courts took an average of 252 more days
to complete its investigation phase beyond tle mandated 34 days. Likewise, the court required 726 more
days to complete its actions to reach the sentencing phase beyond the mandated 68 days. In addition, the
court had not yet entered its decision in 75 percent of those cases where all investigation had been
completed. Ifn civil cases, courts took an average of 271 days in excess of the mandated time to bring



- 8 -
cases to "at issue" status (answers to complaints), an average of 125 days in excess of the mandated time
(65 days) to complete the investigative phase, and an average of 242 days in excess of the mandated time
(60 days) to reach its judgment.

1.30 The consequences of time delays are especially serious for individuals charged with crimes. Only
an estimated 32 percent of the 38,000 people in prison have actually been sentenced. The remainder of
those incarcerated are awaiting final adjudication. According to the Attorney General's office, about 13
percent of this total will be found innocent. A significant percentage of those people will have served the
same time in prison (or more) as if they had been formally sentenced. This condition is the result of trial
court delay, inadequate system for governance and monitoring of the system, and inadequate enforcement
of disciplinary procedures against judges who take longer than normal to decide cases.



- 9 -
1.31   Growth in the number of cases entering the courts combined with processing delays result in a
growing backlog of pending cases. The increased backlog has occurred despite the appointment of judge
assistants (jueces relatores) to help process cases, auxiliary judges (jueces accidentales) to assist in
judgements, and roving judges (jueces itinerantes) to help specifically with penal cases. As shown in
Box 6, the number of cases entering the trial courts is expected to increase from 270 thousand in 1992
to 450 thousand in 1997. As a result, the backlog of pending cases in trial courts is estimated to grow
by 36 percent to almost 150,000 cases. Alternatively, given current processing times and procedures,
an additional 800 judges would need to be employed to prevent any further increase in backlogs; under
present court organizational and administrative arrangements, this would imply an increase in the Judicial
Council budget by 75 percent or US$ 68 million.
1.32   Causes of Delays and Backlogs. In addition to the growth of entering cases, overall budget
constraints, and delays on the part of other agencies, several factors under the control of the courts
explain delays and backlogs. These factors fall into four categories: (a) poor administrative procedures,
(b) archaic office technology and inefficient court organization, (c) inadequate supplies and technical
support, (d) unacceptable case files, and (e) deteriorated and inadequate facilities.
1.33   Inefficient administrative procedures include inconsistent and disorganized case filing, failure to
monitor case processing and followup on required actions, lack of operational or administrative manuals,
lack of case summaries on the current status of cases, duplication of records, archaic filing procedures,
and non-uniform court office hours. The legal requirements of case processing should be reviewed,
operational and administrative manuals prepared, court personnel trained in new procedures, and case
monitoring and followup procedures instituted. The fact that courts can establish their own hours for
taking statements, presenting pleadings, making deposits, receiving copies of judicial actions, requesting
court notifications, reviewing files, etc., imposes inconvenience, costs, and delays on the users of the
courts. The Judicial Council should as part of the effort to establish revised and uniform administrative
procedures establish greater uniformity in office hours.
1.34   Office technology is outdated with judges and their secretariats lacking even photocopiers and
basic computers for word processing. Venezuela should follow the lead of other countries (e.g.,
Colombia, Spain, the U.S.) and introduce computers for case management; software for this purpose
could easily be developed and supported in Venezuela, or existing software packages used in other
countries (e.g., Gesius .n Spain) could be purchased for that purpose. Computerized case management
would permit court personnel and the public to quickly and easily determine case status, facilitate case
monitoring and followup, and produce the statistics required to evaluate overall court workload and
performance. In addition, the introduction of computers could substantially increase court employee
productivity and thereby permit reorganization of court offices. In particular, the Colombian experience
demonstrates that the ratio of judges to support staff can be reduced by about half through the sharing
of one common secretariat by three to six judges. Such reorganization in Venezuela could generate large
savings in personnel expenditures, which could then finance an increase in the number of judges.
1.35   Inadequate supplies and technical support reduce the productivity of court personnel. At present,
each court receives approximately US$3285 annually for basic supplies, about one-third less than the
required amount. Also, court personnel including many judges do not have access to codes, statutes, and
other legal reference material; these materials are essential to improve the quality and uniformity of
judicial decisions. The Judicial Council should also consider developing a computerized data base on
current legislation and jurisprudence, especially abstracts of decisions of the Supreme Court, which would
permit inexpensive and easy updating as well as easy access by courts with the necessary computer
technology.



- 10-
1.36   Case files are in poor condition as a result of the growth in pending cases and insufficient filing
space, both in the courts themselves and in the storage facilities of the General Archives. The courts
need to develop a storage policy to determine which cases should be kept in the courts, which sent to the
General Archives for physical storage, and which should be kept on opt cal disk by the General Archives.
The General Archives, in turn, need to invest in new technology to replace physical files with less space-
consuming alternatives.
1.37   Finally, court facilities are inadequate. The physical layout of court facilities require that long
lines of people extend into the sidewalk areas just to get into the buildings. Inside the buildings, the court
offices are small and provide only for a separate office for the judge and a small room for the files. The
executive secretary and court clerks are located in an open area which permits the attorneys, parties and
general public to gather around the work stations of these employees. This creates considerable
disorganization, noise and work interruption. The congestion makes privacy for conducting interviews,
taking statements and preparing official documents almost impossible. Furthermore, this excessive
concentration of people makes control of case files being reviewed by attorneys and parties extremely
difficult and susceptible to pilferage and destruction of the entire file or pertinent documents therein.
ludicial Personnel: Selection. Compensation. and Training
1.38. The qualifications and capacity of judicial
personnel-judges, administrators, and  public                Court Personnel 1992
defenders--is a result of pre-service training, the
personnel  selection  process,  salaries,  and    Titled

1.39   Judge Selection and Compensation.
While the 1980 Judicial Career Law established
the principles of judicial selection, the law was Box 7
not fully implemented until 1991. In principle,
all judgeships are filled through open competitions, with the restriction that each applicant have some
minimum experience practicing law and be a member in good standing of the Bar (Colegio de Abogados).



- 11 -
Applicants are evaluated on the basis of credientials, a two-hour written examination, and a foitu.
minute oral examination by the evaluation board. For a municipal judgeship, the evaluation bv J
consists of two magistrates from the Judicial Council and one superior court judge from the region of ;-.e
vacant position; for a superior court judge, the evaluation board includes two judges from the Supi
Court and one magistrate from the Judicial Council. Judges are expected to enter their career ai  a
municipal level and attain higher levels by entering and winning open competitions.
1.40 Prior to 1991, the Judicial Council appointed judges to fill court vacancies without oiti
competitions. A number of the appointed judges were given only temporary appointments, especial' st
the municipal level. As a result, currently thirty-seven percent (398) of titled judgeships (see Box '/   -
held by provisional judges (jueces provisorios). Private lawyers and the national press claim poli i KJd
affiliation has dominated other selection criteria prior to 1991. Since 1991, the Judicial Council . s
implemented a policy of open competitions to fill all court vacancies and, also, has begun the process f
holding open competitions to replace the provisional judges. Eighty competitions were held in 1991, ?-,,d
forty-four were held in the first quarter of 1992. The Council plans to hold open competitions to rep,i--e
most provisional judges by the end of 1993.
1.41   The Council has made a serious effort to increase the transparency and use of non-politic _,
objective criteria in selecting and appointing new judges. Since the magisterial membership of
Council can change every four years, the continuity of the current effort should be ensured thro
establishment of a review panel to audit judicial selection and issue public findings. The Constituti. 2-1
reforms under debate in the Congress propose a Judicial Commission which could have sX h
responsibility.
1.42   The salaries of judicial personnel are in principle set by the Judicial Council; in practicc _ie
Council is constrained in salary-setting by the budget negotiated at the executive level with the Miin s.Y
of Finance and the President's Budget Office. In recent years, judicial salaries have been pegged to K
pay of central iovernment administrators and executives (see Box 8). After several years of decline,  - I
judges' salaries increased by 75 percent between 1989 to 1991, although real pay in 1991 was stii! 2)
percent below its 1984 level. Judges' salaries are not determined through comparisons with the incorie
of private-practice lawyers of similar experience. In addition to their salary, some civil court trial jud,n-s
share revenues received from judicial fees (arancelks) with other court staff. Although judges receivi.,g
fee revenues are paid lower salaries, the result of such revenue distribution is high variance in judge-s'
salaries at the trial court level and some trial court judges earning considerably more than superior re'wt
judges. Since adequate salaries of judicial personnel are critical to attracting and retaining quali"Me
candidates and to discouraging impropriety, the Judicial Council should carry out a study to determn.ne
appropriate salary levels and agree with OCEPRE and the Ministry of Finance on the means of
implementing required changes.
1.43   Judicial Trainin,. Modern judicial systems put strong emphasis on judicial training to dex eop
appropriate specialized legal knowledge and management capacity among court personnel. So.-.ie
countries (e.g., France, Spain) have excellent schools to train future judges, and new judges are selec aed
solely from the ranks of the school's graduates. Other countries (e.g., the U.S.) which have a tradi 'on
of political appointment of judges, emphasize the training of newly appointed judges and the developm'n;t
of specialized administrative capacity among other court staff. Both types of systems attempt to dew mo
a strong sense of ethical responsibility and a professional attitude which discourages corruption. l- l
systems also emphasize the importance of contir ing education to keep judges apprised of recent  ;
developments and to provide judges less structured opportunities to exchange with one another lessolis
of experience.
1.44   Judicial training in Venezuela is the responsibility of the Judicial School (Escuela dr ia
Juidicatura), which was established under the 1980 Ley de Carrera Judicial. The Judicial School h  ( s
its mission to recruit and train future judges in legal and administrative issues and provide contiin <d

training throughout their career; it also has the responsibility (never fulfilled) to conduct research on the
judicial system. The School has a staff of ten to serve the 1200 judges and 10,000 administrative
employees of the court system.
1.45   Largely for reasons beyond its control, the Judicial School has failed in its mission. Limited
organizational capacity and meager financial and staff resources prevent the School from offering the
quality and variety of courses required to adequately train future judges. Furthermore, as noted above,
the selection of judges has in practice been carried out independently Ot ie School. As a result, few
graduates of the School have actually been selected for judgeships; these problems led the School to
abandon its training program in the mid-1980's.
1.46   The School gained a new lease on life in 1990 with a renewed mandate to educate future judges.
Resource constraints have led to the School emphasihing the short-term preparation of candidates for open
competitions; these courses typically last six weekends and are open to all qualified candidates, as
approved by the Secretary General's office in the Council. During 1992, these short-term courses are
primarily oriented to the candidates who will compete to replace provisional judges at the municipal level.
1.47   The School's orientation to pre-service training and its limited resources continue to constrain its
effectiveness in a setting where most sitting judges have no formal preparation to be judges. The School
needs to reorient its emphasis to in-service training to develop improved administrative and legal
knowledge among judges and other court personnel.
1.48   In addition to a reorientation to in-service training, the School requires significant investments
in institutional development. This investment should include the following:



- 13-
(a) Development of a curriculum for training judges and court personnel. Private bar association
members complain that many judges lack basic legal and administrative skills, suggesting the
need for re-training in these areas. A diagnostic study of training needs should be carried
out, and formal curriculums should be developed. The study should also identify additional
course material (case studies, etc.) which should be developed.
(b) A diagnostic study of training needs should also result in a list of training priorities (advised
by a committee of respected judges and other court personnel) and an annual training plan,
to be negotiated v%itl, the Planning and Budgeting Division of the Judicial Council. The
annual training plan should also anticipate regional differences in training needs and
requirements for delivering training in numerous locations; a study should be carried out to
examine the feasibility of using the distance learning facilities of the National Open
University (Universidad Nacional Abierta). T-aining of judicial personnel in the use of
modern office technology should be closely coordinated with the implementation plan for the
project, including the testing of training pilots at the same time as execution of the court
pilots in Stage I of the project.
(c) A part-time teaching faculty comprised of sitting judges should be developed through the
identification of candidates and training, including visits to exemplary training programs in
other countries.
(d) An important role for the Judicial School should be organization of regional and national
conferences of court officials and judges to promote communication and stimulate discussion
between regions and all staff levels.
(e) Given the recent reactivation of the Judicial School, there are no evaluations of the
effectiveness of training programs. Evaluation instruments should be developed and records
maintained and open to inspection by staff of the Judicial Council.
Physical Infrastructure
1.49   Overview. The physical infrastructure of Venezuela's court system managed by the Judicial
Council incluides 1085 courts, 19 regional offices, and 151 public defender offices, and a central
headquarters. As shown in Box 9, 67 percent of all courts are in urban areas, compared with 33 percent
in rural areas. Courts in relatively large urban areas are typically grouped together in the same building
whereas rural courts are widely dispersed in separate buildings.
1.50   At present, most courts (70 percent) are rented from private owners; thirty percent are located
in public buildings either owned by the Judicial Council or other governmental agencies. Rented facilities
frequently do not meet the space and logistic requirements of a courtroom and the Judicial Council's
policy is to increase the number of buildings which meet specific court i,quirements, including the
adoption of Organization Models for courts and public defender offices namely Multiple Judge Model,
Corporate Model and the Individual Model. Given present investment plans, if the number of judges
continues to increase at the 1991 rate (33 per year) rented facilities could decrease to 55 percent of total
courts by 1996.
1.51   Court facilities are generally regarded as being in poor condition, both in terms of their state of
repair and their adequacy for the functions of a court. The Council's Maintenance Division, which is
responsible for maintaining court buildings, has a 1992 budget allocation of US$0.4 million, about
US$370 per court. While no inventory or survey exists to accurately assess the building stock,
inspections of courts in major urban areas demonstrate that most courts are extremely congested and in
poor repair.

1.52   Capital ExDenditure and Finance. The Government's plans for capital investment in the physical
infrastructure of the courts call for outlays of approximately US$54 million to complete construction of
604 new court offices between 1992 and 2000; this compares with outlays of US$29 million between
1986 and 1991. As shown in Box 10, 221 court offices are currently under construction and will be
completed by 1994. Highest priority has been assigned to courtroom construction in urban areas, where
court congestion is the greatest. All planned construction will be in urban areas and take the form of
multi-courtroom buildings, which will facilitate the sharing of common services by several judges and
thereby lead to reduced court operating costs.

Box 10
1.53   The Judicial Council does not have a line item in the budget for court construction. Rather, it
coordinates priorities and investments with the Ministry of Urban Development (MINDUR), which is
responsible for most centLal government capital investment, and with the state governments, which



- 15 -
currently enjoy the benefits of a national policy of revenue decentralization.  Prior to 1991 state.
governments would assess their court construction requirements and, with the participation of tlhe  Council,
request MINDUR funding. Since 1991 state governments are increasingly financing court co.stiuction
under cost-sharing agreements where the Council promises to cover the operating costs of tlw completed
facility. Autonomous federal agencies finance some court construction in Caracas and the state of Z.ulia.
1.54   Problems. The dilapidated conditions and inadequate space of existing urban court facilities are
being addressed by the Government's investment plan; the lack of investment in rural courts means a high
percentage of those courts will continue to rented and be inadequate.
1.55   In addition to inadequate facilities, investment planning suffers from a lack of basic inifoimation
on p',ysical infrastructure and maintenance requirements, lack of inventory of office equipment,
inadequate capacity to analyze lease-buy options, and nonexistent models of courtroom designs for
different types of courts, including the space rr 4uirements and security needs of automated management
systems. Finally, the involvement of several actors in the construction and maintenance of buildings
requires more formal coordination of plans.
D. Lessons Learned from Bank Lending Experience
1.56   Since this is the first instance of Bank support for judicial reforms, no lessons of sectoral
experience are available. However, the Bank's extensive involvement in public sector management
projects provide several key lessons that are incorporated in the design of the project. These lessons are
derived from OED assessment of free-standing technical assistance in Africa and LAC Technical
Department evaluations of recently completed public sector management projects in Chile (2504-CH) and
Peru (2204-PE).
1.57   These lessons include: (i) TA projects should be limited in scope to permit adequate preparation,
focused implementation, and adequate supervision; (ii) Borrower commitment is essential to develop a
sense of ownership of project 'Ftivities in affected institutions, resulting in effective implementation; (iii)
there should be continuity in project management; (iv) terms of reference for key consultants and studies
should be spelled out in detail by project negotiations; and (v) there should be periodic evaluation of
projects to permit adjustments in design and implementation arrangements.
1.58   The lessons from past stand-alone TA loans have been incorporated into the project. The design
of the project has also been guided by Bank country strategy aimed at supporting the Government's
economic adjustment program, including legal reforms to strengthen the private sector enabling
environment, and strengthening public sector institutions. Thus, the project would reduce the private
sector transaction costs associated with preparing and enforcing contracts and would strengthen the
Judicial Council and improve efficiency in its resource allocation.
1.59   In addition to being consistent with country strategy and objectives, the scope of the project has
been guided by: (a) Borrower commitment to project objectives and components; and (ii) requirements
for effective project administration and supervision.  The initial impetus for this project and its
components came from the Government, and the Executive, Legislative and Judicial branches have all
taken actions which demonstrate this commitment. The Government has consistently emphasized the high
priority it attaches to rapid approval and implementation of the project, while recognizing the constraints
on processing imposed by the limited experience of the Judicial Council with project preparation
activities. Continuity in project management is ensured for the first stage of the project, with the current
President of the Judicial Council assigned continuing responsibility for Council overview of the project
beyond his normal presidential term (which ends October 1993). While there may be changes in



- 16 -
composition of the Council itself after June 1994, every attempt will be made to retain PITJ consultant
staff beyond that date.
1.60   Effective project administration and supervision requires both a limited, well-defined project scope
and detailed preparation of all project components. The scope of the project has been limited to four
well-defined components, all within the purview of the Judicial Council. The design of court office pilots
to be implemented during the first stage of the project were reviewed, and terms of reference CTOR) for
consultants and s.udies were discussed during appraisal, with TOR for key studies and consultancies
confirmed at n    ts. To facilitate supervision and admninistration, indicators of project activities and
outputs were agreed to during negotLations, including those indicators to be used for supervision.
E. Rationale for Bank Involvement
1.61   The lack of an efficient and credible judiciary is a threat to the success of the Government's
economic program to improve the enabling environment for p; ivate secfor development and is the basic
rationale for Bank involvement in the project. In addition, Venezuela lacks the expertise to correct the
problems of the judicial system, and concern with reducing public sector deficits currently constraints the
resources required to strengthen judicial operations. W'hile the f3ank has no prior experience in judicial
administration, it has developed considerable expertise in administrative strengthening and reorganization,
design of management information systems, and improvement of case management in other government
agencies. T his expertise, the perceived objectivity of the Bank in a sensitive area, and the Bank's record
of support for the Government's economic program provide the ra.ionale for the Bank's involvemeni from
the perspective of the Government. Bank support for long-term institutional development of legal
infrastructure is consistent with the Bank's broader strategy to improve economic and public sector
management.
II. THE PROJECT
A. Project Obiectives
2.1    The proposed project aims to improve Venezu .a's enabling environment for private sector
development and reduce both the private and social costs of justice. Its immediate objectives are to: (a)
improve efficiency in the allocation of resources with in the judiciary; (b) increase courtroom productivity
and efficiency; (c) strengthen the institutional capabilities of the Judicial Council to perform its functions;
(d) strengthen the institutional capabilities of the Judicial School to perform its functions; (e) strengthen
the capabilities of judicial personnel in general to perform their respective functions; and (f) improve the
physical condition of the courts.
B. Project Description
2.2    To achieve these objectives the project would carry out the following activities: (a) strengthen the
planning, budgeting, and management capacity of the Judicial Council, including increasing the
accountability of the courts through the design and implementation of an information system to provide
quantifiable performance indicators; (b) improve courtroom productivity and efficiency through changes
in court administration (management of its personnel, budget, and physical facilities), case administration
(recording, tracking, and processing case files), and automation of courtroom and caseload management;
(c) strengthen the administrative capacity and specialized legal knowledge of court personnel, including
knowledge pertinent to commercial and business litigation, by strengthening the capacity of the Judicial
School to design and deliver training; and (d) rehabilitate and construct and upgrade courtrooms. Project
preparation activities included development of a Matrix -f Key Project Activities (Annex 6) including
information on objectives, physical outputs, substantive impacts and outcomes, timing targets, and agency
counterparts. Detailed descriptions of project activities are given in Annexes 1-5.



- 17  
2.3    The project would last five years (1993 - 1997), with a comprehensive mid-term review by
December 31, 1994; the criteria for the mrid-term review are given in Annex 8. Project activity prior
to the mid-terni review would comprise the following: (a) design, testing, and evaluation of revised
administrative procedures, reorganized courts and public defender's offices, and automated management
systems in three locations, including training seminars to educate judicial personnel on the benefits of
administrative reforms and automatior.; (b) development of detailed plans for courtroom reorganization
and automated information systems for approximately half of all judicial offices; (c) provision of
reference texts on jurisprudence, procedural manuals, and basic office equipment for all courtrooms
having adequate security and electrical power; (d) training of key administrative personnel in the Judicial
Council and its regional offices, provision of essential equipment, modernization of financial management
and property management, and design of an information network to connect the Council to its regional
offices; (e) design and testing of curriculum to train judges and courtroom personnel in court
administration; (f) courtroom construction and rehabilitation; and (g) studies to complete preparation of
the second stage of the project, including analysis of procedural codes and Judicial Council directives
which may affect pilot replication. The study results, replication plans, and pilot evaluations will provide
the basis for the mid-term review of the project, which will result in agreement between the Government
and the Bank on pilot replication and further studies to be carried out in the second stage.
2.4    Activities subsequent to the mid-term review would include the following: (a) implementation
of revised administrative procedures in all courts and judicial offices; (b, installation of automated
information management systems in courtrooms which have adequate physical .nfrastructure, and training
of courtroom personnel; (c) continued training of administrative personnel of the Judicial Council and its
regional entities and installation of the information network to its regional offices; (d) establishment of
capacity in the Judicial School to plan and deliver a permanent in-service training program for judges and
courtroom personnel; (e) training of courtroom personnel in administrative and legal issues; (f) continued
courtroom construction and rehabilitation to ensure successful implementation of the project; and (g)
completior of studies, agreed tu during the mid-term review, to facilitate implementation of the project
and to prepare a possible follow-on project.
2.5    The administrative capacity of the Judicial Council will be strengthened and information for
decisionmaking will be improved through: (a) consultancies to develop a human resource development
plan for the Council, to introduce program budgeting, to develop the capacity to plan and manage
physical infrastructure, to improve capacity to provide technical assistance to the regions and individual
courts, to strengthen management capacity of the regional offices, to develop a communications network
for the regional offices, and to develop personnel, financial, and building and equipment inventory data
bases; (b) studies to develop courtroom performance indicators, to develop a long-term infrastructure
development plan, to develop recurrent budgeting and salary norms, to assess the private costs of
litigation, to assess access to justice by the poor, to assess the feasibility of improving alternative dispute
resolution methods, to assess alternatives for computerizing data bases on legislation and jurisprudence,
to analyze alternative storage policies for court records, to identify priority areas in procedural law related
to the objectives of the project and which merit further in-depth analysis, to improving court efficiency
and productivity, and other studies which may be agreed to by the Council and the Bank; (c) training and
travel to develop the adm.iinistrative and analytic capacity of Council staff, including staff in the
decentralized regional offices; and (d) office equipment and vehicles to provide a communications network
within the Council and between the Council and regional offices and to provide adequate computing and
logistical capacity both in the Council and its regional offices. To strengthen accountability in court
performance, the Council will annually publish indicators of court performance in its annual report,
Memoria y Cuenta, or a separate statistical report; depending on availability and reliability of data, the



- 18 -
performance indicators in Annex 7 should be reported. To ensure project continuity and sustainability,
the Government would appoint a high level commission to monitor and advise the project and would
before effectiveness assign the Director of Planning responsibility for coordination between Council staff.
A detailed description of this project component is given in Annex 1. TOR for the studies of recurrent
budgeting and salary norms are given in Annex 15 and 16, respectively.
2.6    Courtroom  admiiistration will be strengthened through:  (a) consultancies to prepare
administrative manuals, to prepare implementation plans for revised administrative and automation
procedures, to implement and evaluate the automated court pilots, to organize regional and national
meetings to demonstrate new court technology to court personnel, to implement revised administrative
procedures foi court management (administration of the court's personnel, budget, and space and
equipment) and case management (recording, tracking, and processing cases) to all courtrooms, to ensure
the reliable production of courtroom statistics, and to replicate automated systems in courts with adequate
physical infrastructure; (b) studies to assess the legal and regulatory framework of the courts and identify
bottlenecks, including procedural codes and Judicial Council directives, to improving court efficiency and
productivity, and to examine management of court fees and judicial deposits; (c) tra ning of court
personnel in revised and automated procedures; (d) supplies and legal material to establish minimum legal
reference materials for each court; and (e) court and office equipment (photocopiers, typewriters., basic
computers for word processing), supplies, and office modifications required to implement re"ised
administrative and automated processes. The pilots include three alternative organizational models: the
current individual model of one judge with a relatively large staff; an alternative corporate model where
several public defenders at the same location share some staff in common; and a third model where
several judges at the same location and of the same court type share a common staff. Annex 2 provides
a complete description of the project component to modernize courtroom administration.
2.7    Training of judicial personnel will be improved through: (a) consultancies to develop curriculums
and an in-service training plan for court personnel, to develop a training evaluation methodology, to train
instructors, to implement reliable evaluation procedures, to plan and organize study tours, to organize
and carry out periodic regional and national conferences for court personnel; (b) studies to assess training
needs and to evaluate alternative service delivery technologies; (c) training of Judicial School professional
staff and court personnel; and (d) instructional and office equipment. The Judicial Council has appointed
a Judicial Advisory Commission comprised of distinguished practitioners to advise the School. The
Judicial School will submit a 1992-1993 Annual Training Plan as condition of disbursement.
2.8    Rehabilitation, construction, and upgrading of courtrooms to permit replicatiun of the pilot models
will be financed and carried out by the Government. This will include upgrading of courts to be included
in the pilots and rehabilitation, replacement, or upgrading of court buildings which are not currently
adequate for the introduction of reorganized or automated courts. Courts to be included in the pilots have
been identified (see Annex 4). The Judicial Council has reached an agreement with MINDUR to establish
a Working Group to coordinate investment in the courts and to ensure required physical infrastructure
and automation plans are consistent. The Government through its implementing agencies--MINDUR,
state governments, and autonomous federal agencies--plans to construct 250 new courts during the life
of the project. By the end of 1994, 221 courts will be constructed by the following implementing
agencies: MINDUR (13), Centro Simon Bolivar (122), Centro Rafael Urdaneta (58), Government of
Barinas (15), Government of Nueva Esparta (13). The Government will submit annual construction plans
to the Bank by August 31 of each year, with evidence of binding commitments by the implementing
agencies by December 31 of each year. A detailed description of the physical infrastructure component
of the project is given in Annex 4.

2.9    Environment. The project does not directly affect the environment. The project may indirectly
affect the environment by reducing the delay and private costs associated with environmentally related
litigation.
C. Project Cost and Financing
2.10   The project costs are estimated at US$60 million equivalent, based on prices of April 1992. Bank
financed components represent 50 percent of the total cost, with the rest being financed by the
Government of Venezuela (GOV). To expedite implementation, retroactive financing of US$1 million
during the period July 1, 1992 to effectiveness is being recommended. Local costs amount to US$34.7
million equivalent (58 percent of total costs); the foreign exchange component is estimated at US$25.3
million equivalent (42 percent of total costs). The summary of Project Costs (Table 11. 1) and the
Financing Plan (Table 11.2 and Table 11.3) follow. Bank financing by project component and expenditure
category is given in Annex 12.
D. Project Benefits and Risks
2.11   The project is expected to increase courtroom productivity and efficiency and, thereby, reduce
the private sector and individual costs of dispute resolution. The key risks stem from the level of
available budgetary resources, lack of managerial capacity, change in commitment to the project by the
Judicial Council, possible lack of cooperation on the part of judges responsible for implementation at the
courtroom level, and lack of detailed preparation of pilot replication. The budgetary risks would be
mitigated by Government agreement to a long-term investment and expenditure program for institutional
development of the courts, which will be monitored under the project. Future savings in personnel costs
resulting from automation would also reduce budgetary pressures. The lack of managerial capacity on
the part of the Judicial Council and the courts would be mitigated by the project's institutional
strengthening programs and through development of a strong project implementation unit. Change in the
Judicial Council's commitment to the project is minimized by the four-year appointments of Council
members, who uniformly give strong support to the project. The cooperation of judges will be sought
through training and a phased implementation, plan, which will demonstrate the gains to court personnel
from administrative reorganization and automation. Adequate preparation of the second stage of the
project is ensured through analysis of factors affe~cting pilot replication; technical assistance to develop
detailed replication plans; continuous assessment of the implementation of the pilots; and results of other
studies. The study results, replication plans, and pilot evaluations will provide the basis for the mid-term
review of the project, which will result in agreement between the Government and the Bank on piloc
replication in the second stage.
III. PROJECT MPLEMEENTATION
A. Agencies Involved
3.1    The Judicial Council (JC) is the principal executing agency for this project, with MINDUR, the
state governrments, and autonomous federal agencies sharing executing responsibility for the physical
infrastructure component, which is financed solely with Government counterpart funding. The Fondo
de Inversiones de Venezuela (FIV) will act as procurement and consultant contracting agent for the
project.



- 21 -
3.2    The project would last five years (1993 - 1997) and inelude four major components. Annex 6
describes the key project activities, their expected outputs and impacts and the implementation schedule,
all of which were agreed to during appraisal.
3.3    Detailed Action Plans covering the first eighteen months (January 1, 1993, - June 30, 1994) of
the project have been developed and were agreed to during negotiations for each of the first three major
project components; these are given in Anrexes 9-11. At negotiations, the 1992-1993 Action Plan for
the physical infrastructure component was agreed to, At negotiations agreement was also reached that
beginning March 30, 1994, and continuing that same date for each subsquent year of the project, the
Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will submit an Action Plan for each project component, including
proposed training and terms of reference for proposed studies for Bank review.
3.4    Project Management. An adequately staffed Project Implementation Unit reporting directly to the
JC Director of Planning will be established and will adopt a Project Preparation Manual by effectiveness,
The PIU staff will include a Project Manager, three Project Component Managers, and support staff
satisfactory to the Bank as described in Annex 5; draft TOR discussed during negotiations are given in
Annexes 17 and 18. The PIU will by effectiveness contract with the Fondo de Inversiones de Venezuela
(FIV) to contract loan financed consultants, procure equipment and make related payments, maintain
accounts and arrange for annual audits in accordance with Bank Guidelines.  The PIU  will be
strengthened by short-term, specialized consultants to facilitate project implementation and to ensure
appropriate project monitoring. The PIU will be equipped with vehicles to facilitate movement of staff
and to ensure appropriate communication. The Judicial Council will provide equipment, office and
clerical support to the PIU. To ensure the continuity of the project, it was agreed at negotiations that the
Government will maintain the composition of the PIU during the execution of the project.
3.5    Assurances were given during negotiations that within four months of project completion the
Judicial Council will prepare a Project Completion Report (PCR) to assess the success of' the project,
including the achievement of institutional, administrative, operational, and financial objectives an l goals,
and general evaluation of the lessons learned from project experience.
B. Project Monitoring

mid-term review are specified in Annex 8. At the mid-term review agreement would be reached on the
pilot replication plan and studies to be carried out subsequent to the review.
C. Procurement
3.8   Procurement of goods under the proposed project would be carried out in a manner consistent
with Bank Procurement Guidelines (May 1985). Consulting services would be contracted in accordance
with Bank Guidelines sor Use of Consultants (August 1981). A review of country procurement practices
has been complkced, and those procedures have been found to be acceptable. During negotiations,
agreement was reached that procurement would be done using standard documentation based on the
Bank's sample bidding documents.
3.9   The total cost of eguipment (including information technology equipment and software and
vehicles, see Procurement Table III.l) is estimated at about US$15.7 million, including contingencies,
of which about 75 % would be procured through international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures, both
in accordance with Bank guidelines, and the remainder through LCB or shopping procedure acceptable
to the Bank. Supply contracts will include maintenance and technical assistance beyond the warranty for
a period of three years. Contracts valued at above US$200,000 would be awarded on the basis of ICB.
Where ICB procedures are used and for bid evaluation purposes, goods manufactured locally would be
given a preference margin as per Bank guidelines. Contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of
US$200,000 or less, but more than the equivalent of US$25,000 up to an aggregate amount equivalent
to US$3.8 million, may be awarded in accordance with competitive bidding procedures locally advertised,
satisfactory to the Bank. Goods estimated to cost the equivalent of US$25,000 or less, up to an aggregate
amount equivalent to US$2.4 million may be procured by shopping procedures acceptable to the Bank.
Procurement for the project would be carried out by FIV, which is familiar with Bank procurement.
3.10  Packages for books, furniture and vehicles would be small and would be delivered in small
quantities at scattered locations. Packages under US$25,000, aggregating to US$2.4 million, would be
procured under local shopping procedures; packages between US$25,000 and US$200,000, in an
aggregate amount of about $0.8 million, would be procured using LCB procedures acceptable to the
Bank. No package is expected to be above US$200,000.
3.11   Civil Works. The total cost of construction, rehabilitation, and upgrading of courts, estimated at
US$25.4 million, will be financed entirely by the Government according to its local procedures (see
Annex 19).
3.12  The Bank's prior review of procurement documentation will cover all major procurement steps
(advertising, bidding documents, evaluation methodologies and reports, award recommendations and
contracts), and would apply to all contracts procured under ICB and first two contracts under LCB
regardless of the amount and all contracts for goods in excess of US$150,000 under LCB. The Bank will
also review all documentation (terms of reference, evaluation of proposals and evaluation methodology,
award recommendations and contract) for all consulting services included in the project, both for
individual consultants and contracts for technical assistance, training and software development, as well
as results of the studies. It is estimated that the prior review process would cover about 90% of the
Bank-financed contracts.
D. Disbursement and Special Accoktit
3.13   Funds from the Bank loan are expected to be disbursed over a period of five years, including
retroactive financing of US$1.5 million from July 1, 1992 to date of signature. Disbursements of the
Bank loan would be made against: 100 percent of consulting fees not provided as counterpart, 100 percent
of foreign-procured imported equipment, 90 percent of locally-procured imported equipment, 100 percent



- 24 -
of training costs, 100 percent of furniiture and installation and 100 percent of the Project Implementation
Unit cost including consultants, training, office preparation, equipment and project auditing.
3.14   Actions to be Agreed. Conditions of project effectiveness include development of a detailed
project operation manual consistent with Bank Guid.-lines for procurement and contracting consultants.
3.15   Documentation of Expenditures Withdrawal applications for goods and works with a contract
value of US$150,000 or more would be supported by full documentation. Contracts below US$200,000
antd other disbursements against activities would be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditure
(SOE), for which supporting documents would be maintained by PIU in the Judicial Council and would
be made available for Bank staff review. Because of the large volume of disbursements expected to be
clained under SOEs, special efforts would be made for the selective review of SOE documentation by
visiting Bank missions. Withdrawal applications for consultant expenditure for all contract amounts would
be supported by full documentation.
3.16   SDecial Account. A Special Account in US dollars would be opened at the Central Bank witlh an
initial deposit of US$1.5 million equivalent, corresponding to about four months of average
disbursements. The Ban3c would replenish the Special Account for the amount of the withdrawals on
account of eligible expenditures at the request of the Borrower.
E. Accounting and Audits
3 17   The PIU would maintain records (in electronic and paper medium) for each project component,
and consolidate them into the project accounts and SOEs. Supporting documentation would be maintained
by the PIU and be made available to Bank missions and independent auditors as required.
3.18   Project accounts, including the special account and SOEs, would be audited annually in
accordance with appropriate auditing principles applied by external private independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank. with terms of reference for auditors and reports approved by the Bank; this was
agreed at negotiations. Cost of the consultant services to be employed for the annual audits would be
eligible for financing included in PIU under the loan. Audit reports would be furnished to the Bank within
five months after close of the Government's fiscal year (December 31).

improving the amount and quality of information provided to the Judicial Council regarding court
performance and bottlenecks in case processing; and (g) identifying priority areas in procedural law
related to the component's objective which merit further analysis.
3.   To achieve these objectives, the project would: (a) review the legal and regulatory framework of
court administration and develop procedural manuals for judicial offices (courts and public defender
offices); (b) ensure all judicial offices have minimum required reference and code books, procedural
manuals, and office equipment, and train court personnel in revised administrative procedures in all courts
in the country; (c) design, implement, and evaluate pilots of reorganized court models; and (d) implement
the three models, according to their feasibility, and subject to a program to be agreed between the Bank
and the Judicial Council, including development of a regional support structure and training of court
personnel.
4.   The project would finance consultants and studies to: (a) review all pertinent laws, executive
decrees and JC-issued regulations to prepare a simplified text (texto ordenado) and operational manual;
(b) to develop and test software in pilots in Caracas, Carabobo, and Aragua, and demonstrate their results
to judicial personnel; (c) to organize regional and national meetings to demonstrate new court technology
to court personnel; (d) to provide the data required to evaluate the pilots and to carry out that evaluation;
(e) to prepare implementation plans and implement revised court administrative procedures for
management of the court's personnel, materials and supplies budget, building and equipment maintenance,
and physical space; (f) to implement revised case management procedures, including recording, tracking,
and processing cases, to all courtrooms and public defender's offices; (g) to provide ongoing technical
assistance and support to the courts in automated systems; (h) to ensure the reliable production of court
statistics, including assisting the Statistics Division of the Judicial Council to develop baseline data for
the project performance indicators; (i) to prepare implementation plans and implement automation
procedures; (j) and examine the management of court fees and judicial deposits. The project would
finance training of court personnel (judges, secretaries, bailiffs, clerks, public defenders) in revised and
automated procedures.

5.   The project would finance: (a) computers and software for the pilot courts and for replication of
the pilots; (b) supplies and legal material (code books) to establish minimum legal reference libraries for
each court; and (c) court and office equipment (photocopiers, typewriters, basic computers for word
processing, secure cabinets) and associated supplies to all courts.
6.    Several Pilot Organization Models would be developed, including three models  with the
descriptions that follow. The first model would apply to courts of the same level and judicial competence
which are physically located in the same building; this model will be tested in six civil and merczntile
superior courts in Caracas. The second model is applicable to public defender's offices which are located
physically in the same building; this model will be tested in six offices in Carabobo . The third model
is applicable to courts and public defender's offices operating individually, not in close proximity to other
courts; this model will be tested in two locations in the State of Aragua.
7.   The multiple Judge model permits the consolidation of administrative staff and provision of
common services for 3-10 judges of the same legal jurisdiction, category and physical location of courts.
It will have at least:
a)    A Chief Titled Judge.
b)   Three to 10 Assistant Judges.
c)    At least one Court Administrator (Secretario).
d)    At least one Bailiff (Alguacil).
e)    A Central Archive.
f)    Common Administrative Staff.
g)    Common, Single Public In.ormation Window.
Characteristics of the Model include:
a)    All Judges are the same legal jurisdiction and category.
b)   All personnel are located in the same building.
c)    Sentencing (Sentenciadores) Judges are separated from the public.
d)   Investigative (Sustanciadores) Judges and the Court Administrator have contact with the
public.
e)    Each Sentencing Judge has an Assistant to help prepare judicial decisions. These Judges
have no administrative function.
f)    Management of the Court is the responsibility of the Chief Titled Judge and the Court
Administrator.
g)   The Common Archive is under the supervision of the Court Administrator.
8.   The second or corporate model is applied to public defender's offices located in the same building.
Currently public defenders act individually lacking both adequate resources and an equitable distribution
of work. These offices include a public defender, an administrator (secretario) assistant and messenger.
The corporate model would permit:
a)    Consclidation of administration processes.
b)    Sharing of physical space.
c)    Provision of public information.
d)   Sharing of human resources.
e)    Centalization and the distribution of cases.
f)    Establishing common defense strategy.



- 32 
Annex 2
Page 3 of 4
Characteristics of this model include:
a)    All public defenders are located in the same building.
b)    The defender's office, administrative staff, the public and the central archive are physically
separately.
c)    There will be a Central Archive.
d)    A Chief Public Defender will be assigned the administrative responsibility for the office.
9.    The third or individual-model will increase the efficiency of the courts and public defenders
through simplified procedures for administration, and a single public information window. There are an
average 10 employees per judge in the individual model and three to four per public defender.
Procedures for all three models will be complemented by the use of computers ^nd software systems,
except in the case of the third model, for individual courtrooms whose size and irnportance is too small
to justify the cost of the computer equipment; nevertheless, the new simplified procexdures will still be
introduced, although manually. The individual or traditional model has the following characteristics:
a)    Each Judge or Public Defender has complete autonomy or independence in administrative
matters.
b)    Each Judge or Public Defender has a secretary or assistant responsible for work peculiar
to that particular court. In addition, each Judge or Public Defender retains responsibility
for supervising the clerical staff.
c)    Each court retains its own archive.
d)    There is a single public information window.
10.  Implementation of the Pilots. The project would finance a consulting firm to prepare procedural
manuals, develop software applications, and implement three models of courtroom and public defender's
offices organization in three different locations (Caracas, Carabobo, and Aragua). The new procedures
and software will be tested (the pilots) during 1993-94 to ensure their correctness and app'icability, to
demonstrate results to judicial personnel, and to permit their replicability throughout the country.
11.  In addition to implementing the pilots, the contractor will by the fourth quarter of 1993, ensure
that all judicial offices (including public defenders) in the country have received manuals and training on
revised administrative procedures; required legal reference and code books; and basic office equipment
(typewriters and, in some cases, computers for basic word processing). In carrying out these tasks, the
contractor will work closely with the consultants to the Statistics Division of the Judicial Council to
coordinate and facilitate the collection of the court statistics required to generate individual court
performance indicators (Annex 13) and baseline data for the project performance indicators (Annex 7).
The contractor will also prepare explanatory materials and carry out regional seminars and workshops
on court reorganization and automation to demonstrate their benefits to judicial personnel, and will carry
out demonstration workshops for judicial personnel at tht pilot sites; at a minimum, selected judicial
personnel from each of the courts to be reorganized and automated in 1994-95 will participate in these
workshops. The Action Plan agreed to with the Bank for this project component for January 1, 1993, -
June 30, 1994, is given in Annex 10.

12.  The pilots would test locally-developed and supported computer software. It is expected that any
difficulties with that software would be modified in the context of the pilots and prior to implementation
outside the pilots. Should locally-developed software prove unworkable, more expensive foreign scftware
(e.g., Gesius or other equivalent softwares) would be adopted; this may require a reduction in the planned
number of courts to be automated. Should court reorganization not prove technically feasible, the project
would consider applying the individual court model to all cours; this, too, would require a reduction in
the planned number of courts to be automated. The evaluacion consultant will provide continuing
quarterly reports to the PIU on the feasibility of implementing the locally-developed software and on the
feasibility of implementing all three pilot models. The PIU should by the first quarter of 1994 provide
the Bank with a proposed program to extend the pilots and seek the approval of the Bank for such plans.
13.  Evaluation of the Pilots. Ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the pilots will be carried out by
an independent, foreign consultant experienced in the design, execution, and evaluation of pilots. The
methodology for the evaluation is provided in Annex 14.; the consultant responsible for designing and
implementing the pilots will ensure that all information required for evaluation is promptly provided to
tne evaluation consultant.
14.  Replication of the Pilots. Once tested, it is planned that the three models will be installed up to
fifty percent of courtrooms and public defender's offices. The selection and timing of the installation of
the models will be prepared by the PIU based on the following considerations: (a) infrastructure
characteristics; (b) feasibility of introduction of changes and commitment by the judges concerned; and
(c) the existing caseload.
15.  Each site will take one week minimum to become operational under the new model, and would
require additional on-going support, diminishing but not disappearing over time. Hence, a team of
consultants will be hired for each of the nineteen regions to install equipment, train users, and offer hot-
line support during the implementation phase of the project. In the fifth year of the project, the PIU will
assess the best alternative for offering continued maintenance and computer-related technical assistance
to the courts; the Government will include financing for such maintenance and technical assistance in the
Judicial Council budget beginning with FY97. The cost of maintenance alone is estimated at US$2
million per year, if carried out completely by a hardware vendor. One alternative which should be
examined by the PIU is for the Judicial Council to develop permanent regional staff to carry out
preventive and routine maintenance, with an agreement with a vendor for more substantial repairs.

JUDICIAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
PROJECT P1SCRIPTION: THE JUDICIAL SCHOOL
1.   The project would develop the institutional capacity of the Judicial School and finance the project-
related in-service training of judicial personnel over the life of the project. The project would also
finance other training specific to and included in other project components. Total cost of the judicial
training project component is estimated at US$5.3 million, with Bank financing of US$4.3 million. Bank
financing would include consultants (US$1.0 million), training (US$3.0 million), and equipment (US$0.3
million). Government financing would be for training (US$1.0 million) of judicial personnel.
2.   The major objective of this project component is to increase the productivity of judicial personnel
audges, court administrators, inspectors, and public defenders) and facilitate implementation of new
administrative systems through effective in-service training. Towards this end, the project would (a)
improve the capacity of the Judicial School to design, plan, deliver, and evaluate training and (b) provide
project-related in-service training to judicial personnel. The success of the project in attaining these ends
would be measured by the project performance indicators listed in Annex 7.
3.   The project would finance consultants to: (a) determine training needs and priorities; (b) develop
course curriculums for in-service training of judicial personnel; (c) evaluate alternative service delivery
technologies, paying particular emphasis to distance learning and assessing the feasibility of using the
distance learning facilities of the Universidad Nacional Abierta (UNA), and determine instructional
equipment required for recommended technologies; (d) identify potential instructors among judicial
personnel and organize training programs to improve their teaching capacity and to train other instructors;
(e) develop an evaluation methodology for in-service courses; (f) deliver and evaluate pilot courses; (g)
with the advice of the Judicial Advisory Commission (comprised of distinguished judges, court
administrators, public defendenders, and inspectors to be named as a condition of disbursement for this
project component) develop a long-term, in-service training plan; (h) plan and organize study tours of
model judicial schools in other countries (e.g., Brazil, Spain, the U.S.) by Judicial School staff, members
of the Judicial Advisory Commission, and potential instructors; and (i) work with School staff to organize
and carry out periodic regional and national conferences for judicial nersonnel. The project would
finance training of (a) Judicial School staff its Advisory Commission, and its instructors to strengthen its
capacity to assess training needs; to develop training plans; to design, plan, and evaluate courses; and to
contract with independent providers of training courses; and (b) judicial personnel in management and
selected substantive and procedural leg-' subjects. Finally, the project would finance instructional
equipment required to develop and deliver training materials.
4.   The project activities of this component would be carried out during the life of the project. Those
activities to be initiated and completed from January 1, 1993 to June 30, 1994, are specified in the Action
Plan given in Annex 11. Tne criteria for mid-term review of this project component are given in Annex
8.

VENEZUELA
JUDICIAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
PROJECT DESCRIPEION: PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE
1.   The Project would improve the physical condition and availability of court buildings in Venezuela.
The total cost of the physicai infrastructure component of the project is estimated at US$25.4 million,
with Bank financing of US$ 0.0 million. The GCOV financing of US$25.4 million
equivalent includes new construction, rehabilitation, and court upgrading.
2.   The major objectives of this project component are to increase the number and quality of court
buildings that facilitate implementation of revised and automated court systems. To achieve these
objectives, the project would carry out: (a) upgrading of the pilot courts and public defender offices to
ensure adequate security and electricity and the space layout required of each model; (b) new construction
and court rehabilitation of approximately 250 courts; and (c) upgrading of an additional 350 courts. The
success of the project in attaining these ends would be measured by the project performance indicators
listed in Annex 7.
3.   Implementation of the pilots requires changes in physical layout of existing courts and public
defender offices to accomodate three alternative Organization Models:
(a)   Space Layout for Multiple Judge Model. The total space requirement to accomodate
consolidation of administrative staff and additional judges is between 300 and 375 square
meters (SM).  The layout provides separate areas for the public, judges, and their
secretaries, court administrator, administrative staff and clerks, file room, and in the case
of criminal courts, enclosure for Initial Presentation.
(b)   Space Layout for Corporate Model. The total space requirement is 275 to 300 SM for this
model applied to public defender offices. The layout provides separate areas for the public,
public defenders, administrative staff and clerks and file room.
(c)   Spe Layout for Individual Model. The total space allocated is 150 to 175 SM. This
smallest court model is suitable for individually operating courts located in large and small
urban centers. Individual courts in rural areas have different space and usage requirements.
Review of these layouts may be required during the pilots if locations in rural areas are to
be automated.
3.   The project would finance as part of Judicial Council (JC) component consultants, works and
studies to: (a) coordinate infrastructure planning between JC, MINDUR and the state governments, (b)
assess the adequacy of existing space in courtrooms, (c) d velop revised layouts and implementation plan
and carry out remodeling of pilot court and pulic defender locations, and (d) prepare a long term
investment plan for court rehabilitation and construction. To facilitate coordination of planning, finance,
and execution of court construction, rehabilitation, and upgrading, the Government has established an
Infrastructure Working Group comprised of two members each from the JC and MINDUR.
4.   The GOV would upgrade fourteen sites (six in Caracas for the Multiple Judges Model, six in
Carabobo for the Corporate Model and two in Aragua for the Individual Model) for use in the pilots;
construct approximately 250 new court offices (at an average cost of US$89,500) per court; and upgrade
approximately 350 court offices (at an average cost of US$8,600 per court) over the life of the project
at an estimated total cost of US$25.4 million. The 221 courts to be completed between 1993 and 1994



- 36 -
Page 2 of 3
are currently under construction; another 29 courts are currently planned for construction in 1995-1996
(see Table 4.1). Net of expenditures to date, the GOV's finance required to complete its 1993-1996
investment plan is US$25.4 million.
5.   New construction of court offices between 1993 and 2000 will almost exclusively focus on Halls
of Justice in major urban centers; these facilities group several courts in the same building (see Table 4.2
for tentative construction plan for 354 court offices at an estimated cost of US$54 million for 1997 to
2000). The 250 court offices to be completed during the project will permit the adoption of the several
Court Organization Models. In addition to the new courts and public defender offices, there are about
350 existing, individual court offices which would only require minor upgrading in order to accomodate
implementation of automated systems; upgrading will primarily include provision of movable partitioning
for enhanced privacy in court operation, improved security spaces for records and equipment, and
upgraded electrical connections for computers.

6.   The executing agencies for this component of the project would be the MINDUR, the state
governments, and two autonomous federal agencies. MINDUR will carry out the improvements required
in the pilot courts and public defender offices by June 30, 1993. The executing agercies and sources of
finance for new court construction have been identified for courts coming on line 1992-1994 (see Table
4.1). By August 31, 1993, the Judicial Council will submit a plan acceptable to the Bank for all
infrastructure improvements, including new construction and court upgrading, to be carried out in 1994.

from the Supreme Court, the Ministry of Justice, COPRE, the Fiscalia, MINDUR, and the Colegio de
Abogados. The PAC will be supported by PIU technical staff and consultants as appropriate. The PAC
will review all quarterly and annual reports on the project and will recommend priorities for consultancies
and studies additional to those specified in Annexes 1-4.

6.   The project will be implemented on the basis of a document called "Project Execution Document"
prepared by the JC and initially used for project definition and approval. Once project implementation
begins, it will be used for project control and as a history log. After project termination, it will be used
for the project evaluation. During implementation, the Project Document will become a continuously
growing file of all facets of the project, constituting a management summary of the entire project and
processes involved. The Project Document should contain at least the following chapters:

COURT PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
The Statistics Division of the Planning Directorate of the Judicial Council will annually, beginning
in 1993, publish a Statistical Report providing information on court workload and performance. The
Report will provide descriptive statistics aggregated at the regional and national level and will include an
annex providing performance indicators on each specific courtroom. The specific indicators to be
published for each court will include:
Productivity Index:
1. Number of sentences and judgements (sentencias) and interlocutory appeal decisions (autos
interlocutorios) for each court, by subject matter (tipo de providencia).
Efficiency Index:
1. Number of sentences and judgements and interlocutory appeal decisions divided by the number
of court employees.
2. Number of final sentences and judgements divided by the number of court employees.
Workload and Congestion Index:
1. Number of filings (procesos) that enter the court, divided by the number of final sentences and
judgements.
Processing Time for Civil and Special Cases:
1. For cases which have concluded, average time between case filing (ingreso del expediente) and
the final judgement divided by the maximum time established by law.
2. For cases which have not concluded, average time between case filing and the current date (at
which the case is reviewed by the investigator), divided by the maximum time established by law
for case filing to judgement.

Processing Time for Penal Cases: Since several offices (police, prosecutor, investigating court, and the
judging court) are responsible for processing penal cases, the source of delays should be clearly
identified.
1. Average time between receipt of the complaint (denuncia) by the police to reception by the
investigative court (juez de instruccion), divided by the maximimum established by law.
2. Average time between formal filing with the investigative court and conclusion of the
investigation (concluido el sumario) divided by the maximum established by law.
3. Average time between receipt of the case by the prosecutor (fiscal) for review and receipt of
the prosecutor's opinion by the court, divided by the maximum established by law.

EVALUATION MIETHODOLOGY FOR THE PILOTS
The objective of the pilots is to improve judicial administrative processes and courtroom efficiency
by:
a.   Reducing the administrative load on judges to enable them to concentrate on judicial
matters.
b.   Improving the capacity of courtroom administrative assistants to manage administrative
processes.
c.   Enable the government to increase the number of judges without a corresponding increase
in staff.
d.   Improve attention to and information provided to the public.
e.   Increase the efficiency of the administration through streamlined procedures and automation
facilitating the training of assistants as judicial assistants.
f.   Improve the amount and quality of information provided to the Consejo for monitoring to
improve transparency of the judicial processes.
INDICATORS
The pilots should provide indicators to quantify achievements on each type of effect. The indicators
proposed are:
Productivity
1.   Number of cases closed (judgements, voluntary dismissals, dismissal by the court) in a period of
time (classified by type of decision).
2.   Proportion of terminations to new filings (with careful analysis of causal factors if there are
unusual increases or decreases).
3.   Number of pending (active and paralvzed) cases and average age of pending cases (classified by
"materia").
4.   Average filing-to-disposition time per case (cl2asified by "materia").

MEASUREMENT AND ANALYSIS
Indicators must be measured at the beginning of the pilot (baseline measurement), after the model
has been fully implemented and operating at least two months, and six months later. Gathering
information for baseline and two months evaluations should be a responsibility of the consulting firm
developing the models.
The results of the indicators should be reviewed to determine improvements or poor results.
Analyses of the indicators should not be limited to quantitative results, but should also evaluate the
qualitative aspects, as well.
COST-EFFECTIVENESS
Models should be economically feasible in order to be attractive to replication. Furthermore, it is
important to transform improvements in productivity into economic figures.
In order to satisfy this requirement, analysts should calculate the number of additional employees
needed to operate the tribunal in the same manner and with similar efficiency achieved with the new
model, and calculate the cost for the new personnel.
Differences in cost between the traditional organization's staff and the new model's team could be
used as a basic figure for economic evaluations.

Study of the Required Recurrent Outlays of the Courts
STUDY: A study to determine court operational supply needs.
OFFICE OF INTEREST: Directorate of Administration of the Judicial Council.
TIME: A consultant should be hired by the third quarter of 1992 and the study completed not later than
January 31, 1993.
ESTIMATED NUMBER OF MAN MONTHS: Six
TYPE OF CONTRACTOR: Local
COOPERATION AND RESOURCES REQUIRED: Data should be provided as to what the actual
consumption has been by specific type of operational supplies at the different locations. Projections will
be needed of the additional new courts as well as the additional supply needs because of automation.
BACKGROUND: Records indicate that the amounts being allocated for operational supplies for court
related activities are insufficient for actual needs. The amount budgeted for 1992 reflects that there will
be a deficit of $1,176,480. It is obv:Xus that unless the funds for operational supplies are increased for
ensaing years, activities contemplated under the project will be adversely affected.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study will be to determine with greater accuracy what the budgetary
allocations should be for the operational supplies for all courts as well as the public defender offices.
ACTIVITIES: The contractor will accomplish the following activities during the study:
1. Determine what the actual consumption of operational supplies of each court and public defender
office was during the last three years through review of appropriate budget, procurement and
usage records. In those courts or offices where such records do not exist, such determination will
have to be made through surveys and interviews as needed.

Annex 15
Page 2 of 2
2. Determine with assistance of the Consejo staff and the Project staff what the incremental
increases of courts, public defender offices and related personnel will be during the life of the
project.
3. Determine what the increases in automation equipment, FAX machines, copiers, typewriters and
other office and court equipment will be in all courts and public defender offices as well as in
the new courts and offices to be created during the entire project.
4. Determine what the costs of all operational supplies by year will be for the period 1993 through
1998 for the projected total number of courts and public defender offices taking into consideration
the automation and other equipment needs as well as the proper inflationary factor.
5. Determine what method of procurement procedure for such supplies will be more cost-effective
and ascertain the costs of procurement, warehousing, distribution and delivery of such supplies.
In this regard, the contractor should take into consideration which supplies should be purchased
centrally for greater cost-savings on the economy of scale basis and which should be purchased
regionally or locally.
6. The contractor should also determine how much of a petty cash fund should be given by type and
size of court as well as for the public defender offices. The contractor should also recommend
what expepse items can be paid from the petty cash fund. A reimbursement procedure for such
purchasees should also be ascertained.
7. The contractor should assure that proper procurement regulations are followed and should
prepare a manual to specify the procurement, warehousing, distribution, requisitioning and usage
reporting procedures for court and public defender offices. This should include a determination
as to whether requisitions, reports, inventories, etc., should be through the regional
administrative office or the central office.
REPORTS: The contractor should prepare an overall action plan to accomplish the study. A mid-term
report should be prepared as of December 31, 1992, with a final report with the recommended manuals
submitted not later than Janaury 31, 1993.

Study of Salaries of Judicial Personnel
STUDY: A study is required to determine what sliould be the salaries of all judicial personnel in the
judicial system of Venezuela, focusing primarily on the judges, secretarios, escribientes, aguaciles and
other related court administrative support staff, establishing job descriptions, job classifications, salary
entry levels; and recommending criteria for recruitment, promotions and salary increases for each
category of position.
OFFICE:  The consultant hired for this study should work with and report to the Chief of the Judicial
Council Personnel Directorate.
TIME: The consultant should be hired by April 1. 1993, and the study should be completed by June
30, 1994.
MAN/MONTHS FOR STUDY: It is estimated that it vwill require 27 man months to complete the study.
CONSULTANT: The consultant can be local or foreign but should be an entity which has had extensive
experience in personnel and salary administration as well as have par-ticipated in previous salary
determination studies in judicial or like systems.
COOPERATION/RESOURCES REQUIRED: The consultant will require the J1udicial Council to instruct
the JC staff and field courts to render full cooperation and assistance to the study team. Thne consultant
will also need to review local governmental pay salaries as well as review the salary systems of judicial
systems of other countries which have income levels similar to that of Venezuela.
BACKGROUND: In the present system, there are four categories of judges according to the level of
court where they preside. The salaries for these categories, however, are not the same for all judges,
even though they may have the same category designation, because some of these judges (and judicial
support staff) receive an addendum from the aranceles judiciales which other judges dlo not receive. This
causes an imbalance which results in resentment and dissatisfaction which may contlibute to corraption.
The establishment and proper implementation of a salary compensation system which is fair, adequate
and administered and controlled effectively are absolutely essential to assure that qualified judicial
personnel is appointed and retained, to give the judicial systern the integrity %%hich it must have for thie
effective administration of justice. Furthermore, the present practice of hiring centrally and the desire of
the Judicial Council to decentralize the hiring of court support staf'f to the regional or local level, requires
that uniform, standard basic qualificatiolns, testing and recruitment procedures, job discriptions, job
classifications, salary entry levels, personnel performance evaluation procedures and reporting,
promotional procedures, salary increases and disciplinary procedures be properly and fully developed for
uniforrm application throughout the judicial system.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study is to provide a classification and salary plan which is responsive
to the needs of a modern judicial system to provide fair compensation for the judicial services performed
by the judges and their administrative support staff. The study should also result in a system which will
enable the establishment of greater career incentives not only for the judges but also witl the court
administrative support staff in order to permit the retention of qualified and experienced judicial personnel
for more effective administration of justice.
ACTIVITIES: The contractor wili accomplish the following:
1. Review the presen; classifications, salaries and other emoluments received by each judge and
court support staff at the different levels of categories and determine in which levels and to what
degree the salaries differ.
2. Determine if any studies and salary plans have been completed or are in process for the judiciary
to ascertain whether such data results can be useful to this study.
3. Ascertain %~hat laws, regulations and other governmental and judiciary guidelines exist and what
will be required to effect any changes recomniended from this study.
4. Review  the salary and classification procedures used in other Venezuelan Executive and
Legislative agencies to determine how the salaries for judicial personnel compare with other like
positions from the other governmental agencies.
5. Conduct interviews, desk audits and time studies of each personnel position at the various levels
and sizes of courts to determine what classifications and salaries should be assigned to each
position.
6. Review salary and personnel systems of other similar judicial systems to provide a comparison
basis with the existing and proposed changes.
7. After the appropriate review and analyses of the above data, develop effective and appropriate
uniform job des.riptions for each job classification, appropriate tests for each job classification,
application and recruitment proced3ures, job performance evaluation procedures and appropriate
reporting and review forms, promotion procedures, salaries for each position at the entry and
promotion stages for court suipport staff.
8. Develop a salary plan for judges for each level of court with appropriate increases as the judge
completes predetermineJ number of years of service.
9. Develop a formula to increace salaries for judicial personnel in accordance with the cost of living
inflationary increases.

10. Prepare manuals on the personnel administration and salary compensation procedures accepted
by the Judicial Council as a result of the study for use by the central personnel office at the
Judicial Council, by the regional administrative offices and for use at each court. Such should
include the pertinent guides for each entity in conformance with the responsibilities to be
established at each respective level.
REPORTS REQUIRED: The consultant should prepare an overall action plan within the first quarter
after his selection by which he will outline how he proposes to accomplish the above objectives. He
should also submit a progress report not later than the fourth quarter of 1993 which reflects what has
been accomplished to date and what is still required to complete the assignment. A final report reflecting
the results of the study and recommendations to implement them should be submitted by June 30, 1994.
