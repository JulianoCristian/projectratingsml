development and reduce both the private and social costs of\n            justice. It will:  (a) improve efficiency in the allocation\n            of resources within the judiciary; (b) increase courtroom\n            productivity and efficiency; and (c) reduce the private\n            sector costs of dispute resolution.  To achieve these\n            objectives the project will support institutional\n            development of the courts and of the Judicial Council, which\n            is responsible for overall court administration, as follows:\n            (a) strengthen the planning, budgeting, and management\n            capacity of the Judicial Council, including the design and\n            implementation of an information system to provide\n            quantifiable performance indicators; (b) improve courtroom\n            productivity and efficiency through reorganization and\n            streamlining courtroom administrative procedures, including\n            automation of caseload and courtroom management; (c)\n            strengthen the administrative capacity and specialized legal\n            knowledge of court personnel, including knowledge pertinent\n            to commercial and business litigation, by strengthening the\n            capacity of the Judicial School to design and deliver\n            training; and (d) rehabilitate existing and construct new\n            courtroom facilities."}, "docdt": "1992-07-15T00:00:00Z"}
