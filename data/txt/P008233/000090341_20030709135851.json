"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The ratings for the Judicial\n            Infrastructure Development Project for Venezuela were as\n            follows: the outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability\n            was likely, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned for judicial reform: (i)\n            It is important to maintain an integrated perspective of\n            justice administration, as a whole, and of the Project, and\n            to perceive the Judiciary as a system of interrelated\n            services. For example, in the case of criminal justice, the\n            penal courts, the police, and Public Prosecutors need to be\n            understood as part of the same system in order for justice\n            administration to be truly effective. (ii) The Judiciary\n            Branch of any country encompasses a broad and complex set of\n            circumstances, which are difficult to undertake in their\n            totality in any Project. Projects should, therefore, be\n            highly explicit in their stated goals and activities, but\n            should have flexibility to accommodate unforeseen\n            situations. (iii) The judiciary projects should generally\n            consult and involve user groups along with other\n            stakeholders in project design and implementation. For\n            reform-oriented efforts in general (i) It was not a good\n            idea to exclude Bank contribution from the physical\n            infrastructure component of the project's financing\n            plan. This fortunately did not prove to have very serious\n            adverse consequences, but should have been handled better.\n            The exclusion may have appeared to have been an attractive\n            measure during the design of the Project, and for its\n            processing within the Bank. This may have been done to stave\n            off possible criticisms for advancing a \"bricks and\n            mortar\" scheme, as well as to restrict the size of the\n            loan, for an oil-rich borrower. These possible concerns,\n            however, were short sighted and minor in the actual Project\n            experience. The absence of suitable and dignified facilities\n            for court functions was, at the very outset, and still\n            remains, a decade later, a major obstacle to the\n            judiciary's hopes of adequately serving\n            Venezuela's needs. It retarded organizational changes,\n            adequate internal communication improvements, and the IT\n            system's substantial upgrading. Fortunately, the Bank\n            was permitted and able to provide useful counsel in various\n            forms, to help reduce these problems, but this role could\n            have been stronger. (ii) The termination of the Judicial\n            Council laid to rest one of Latin America's oldest\n            (perhaps even its very oldest) sector institution charged\n            with managing its lower courts. The Project experience was\n            not designed to fundamentally affect the Council's role\n            independent of Executive Branch direction as well as at\n            arms' length from the judiciary's rector\n            institution, the Supreme Court. Similarly, its actual\n            operations did not directly bear on these aspects.\n            Nonetheless, it was eliminated for reasons, which suggest\n            some lessons for judicial development. One is that such\n            institutions cannot function properly under the segmented\n            direction of different political parties. Another is that,\n            like many other large governmental agencies, they need\n            relatively permanent, full-time executive management to be\n            effective and efficient. (iii) Good collaboration, learning,\n            patience and fortitude among Bank and borrower teams can\n            remedy the shortcomings of ineffective Project design. The\n            latter and the initial dismal track record caused many to\n            believe that the operation would always be a \"Problem\n            Project.\" But instead, quite salutary results were\n            achieved. Why? Because both sides expended efforts to mount\n            a much more effective Project operation, and sustained it\n            long enough to overcome the initial problems, even under\n            adverse political circumstances. This was abetted by solid\n            top management support. (iv) It is important to publicize\n            the Project, but not before tangible results have been\n            achieved. When Project activities are disseminated, the\n            objectives must be clearly spelled out so, as to avoid\n            creating false expectations."}, "docdt": "2003-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
