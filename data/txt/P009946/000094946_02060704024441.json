Several lessons are\n            drawn from the project, as follows. Although the initial\n            quality of engineering designs lacked coordination and\n            quality of site investigations, experienced consultants, and\n            appropriate supervision by line ministries and implementing\n            agencies, currently, international experience is extensively\n            used through modern design, and survey techniques. This\n            dramatically reduced the need for roads redesign, and\n            accelerated implementation. Nonetheless, the contract\n            management framework did not work as envisaged: the dual\n            nature of responsibilities among implementing agencies,\n            hampered coordination, which lead to delays affecting\n            contract management. However, corrective action was taken,\n            by assigning full responsibility to the National Highways\n            Authority, but for the long run, alternative arrangements\n            will have to be developed with clear responsibilities.\n            Regarding procurement, as outlined above, and in addition to\n            a weak knowledge of Bank's guidelines, disagreements,\n            notwithstanding, were conducive to the adjustment of\n            standard contract documents, according to India's\n            specific conditions. Regrettably, the absence of\n            environmental assessments (EAs), and resettlement action\n            plans (RAPs) at the start of the project, aggravated by no\n            capacity training in environmental issues, nor baseline\n            surveys prior to displacement of affected people, delayed\n            implementation; rather, the already, existing standard\n            practice should have been enforced, by implementing early\n            on, both an EA and RAP to ensure the adequate targeted\n            assistance. Further lessons reinforce the need to build\n            client ownership, enhance donor coordination, and establish\n            the necessary readiness for project implementation at\n            approval time."}, "docdt": "2002-05-21T00:00:00Z"}
