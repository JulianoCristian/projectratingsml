global environment outcome was low or\n            negligible, Bank performance was satisfactory, and borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. The lessons learned included:\n            1) Transaction costs for large donors to reach multiple\n            smaller organizations can be reduced by use of a\n            multi-purpose intermediary that provides not only\n            grant-making services but also technical and other support\n            to grantees; 2) Civil society varies greatly in its level of\n            organization and sophistication from country to country.\n            Projects that work with civil society must have sufficient\n            knowledge of the level of development of the sector and be\n            flexible to design appropriate interventions with local\n            organizations, including capacity building; 3) In a project\n            that takes a deliberately experimental approach, phasing\n            start-up of regions is a good way to take advantage of the\n            fact that many lessons are learned early on in project\n            implementation;4) Small grants can be useful to pilot new\n            initiatives, prior to roll out through bigger Bank projects;\n            5) A coherent planning process such as that used in the\n            preparation of ecosystem profiles together with a strategic\n            alignment of grants, can contribute greatly to the\n            coordination and effectiveness of conservation\n            interventions; 6) A governance structure that includes\n            donors in higher-level decision making can be very useful\n            for producing buy-in and can give enable greater flexibility\n            to make adjustments in the course of implementation; 7)\n            Concerns about conflict of interest and self-dealing are\n            bound to arise in cases where the granting organization can\n            also be a grantee, even where such grants are subject to\n            independent review. Experience with the first phase of CEPF\n            has led to much strengthened institutional arrangements to\n            avoid potential conflict of interest in the second phase;\n            and 8) Monitoring outcomes at the portfolio or the global\n            level is more complex than simply aggregating outcomes of\n            individual sub-projects."}, "docdt": "2007-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
