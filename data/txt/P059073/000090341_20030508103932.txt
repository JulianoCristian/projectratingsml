A. 
Project 
Development 
Objective 
1. 
Project 
development objective 
The 
development 
objective 
of 
the 
project 
is 
to 
provide 
a 
reliable, 
affordable and sustainable 
water 
supply 
service 
and 
improve 
the 
sewerage 
and 
sanitation 
in 
the 
“Service  Area” 
of 
the 
Dar 
es 
Salaam 
Water and 
Sewerage 
Authority 
(DAWASA) 
that 
includes 
Dar 
es 
Salaam 
and 
part 
of 
the 
Coast 
region. 
This 
will 
help 
improve 
public health 
and 
well 
being 
in 
a 
city 
prone 
to 
cholera outbreaks 
or 
other water-borne 
diseases 
and 
support 
productive 
activities 
of 
the 
country‘s 
main 
economic 
center. 
This 
will 
be 
achieved 
by: 
(a) 
rehabilitating 
existing 
DAWASA 
drinking 
water 
production, 
transmission, storage 
and 
distribution facilities 
and 
waste 
water 
collection and 
treatment 
facilities 
that 
have 
lacked 
maintenance 
over 
the 
years; 
(b) 
extending 
piped 
water 
supply 
service 
to 
unserved 
areas 
through 
a 
balanced 
program 
of 
construction 
of 
primary 
and 
secondary 
distribution 
pipes and implementation 
of 
a 
commercial 
policy 
that 
will 
favor 
connections 
of 
households; 
(c) 
upgrading 
DAWASA 
commercial 
operations 
to 
industry 
standards, 
reducing physical 
and 
commercial 
unaccounted 
for 
water 
(UfW) 
and 
increasing 
collection 
of 
water and 
sewerage 
bills 
through 
the 
sub-contracting 
of 
operations 
to 
a 
private 
“Operator”; 
and 
(d) 
enhancing 
DAWASA 
financial 
situation 
by 
raising 
the 
Customer 
Tariff 
to 
a 
level 
that 
would initially 
cover 
operation 
and maintenance 
(O&M) 
costs, 
service 
long 
term 
debt 
and contribute 
to 
the 
capital 
expenditure 
program and 
eventually 
compare 
with 
the 
Long 
Run 
Marginal 
Cost 
(LRMC) 
of 
the 
service. 
2. 
Key 
performance 
indicators 
The performance indicators 
by 
which 
the 
project’s outcome 
will 
be 
measured 
can 
be 
summarized 
as 
follows: 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
first 
five 
years 
of 
the 
new 
institutional 
arrangement: 
Reliability 
of 
the 
WSS 
service: 
(a) 
The 
piped 
water 
supply 
service 
will 
be 
continuously 
provided 
to 
a 
minimum 
pressure 
to 
70% 
of 
the 
customers 
throughout 
the Service 
Area 
and 
100% 
of 
the 
samples 
of 
the 
water 
distributed 
tested 
will 
meet Tanzania 
standards; 
and 
(b) 
80% 
of 
waste 
water 
generated 
by 
users 
connected 
to 
sewers 
will 
be 
collected and 
treated 
and 
95% 
of 
effluent 
samples 
will 
meet Tanzanian 
standards; 
Affordability 
of 
the 
WSS 
service: 
(a) 
Low 
income 
households 
will 
be offered 
low 
cost water connections 
as 
well 
as 
increased 
access 
to 
standposts; 
(b) 
low 
income 
households 
will 
benefit 
from 
a 
“lifeline” 
water 
consumption 
for 
the 
first 
five 
cubic 
meters 
per 
month 
(5 
m3/month) 
at a 
lower tariff; 
and 
(c) 
communities 
that 
cannot 
initially 
be 
served 
by 
the 
distribution 
network 
will 
have 
access 
to 
financing 
for 
developing 
alternative 
systems 
and 
assistance 
for 
managing 
them; 
and 
Sustainability 
of 
the 
WSS 
service: 
(a) 
Commercial 
operations 
will 
be 
fully 
reorganized: 
all 
production 
and 
consumption 
will 
be 
metered, 
all 
bills 
will 
be 
established 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
actual consumption, 
average 
UfW 
will 
be 
reduced 
to 
about 
35% 
of 
the 
production 
and 
the combined 
collection ratio 
of 
private 
and 
public 
bills 
will 
reach 
90%; 
(b) 
the Customer 
Tariff 
level 
will 
cover operation and 
maintenance 
(O&M) 
costs 
and 
contribute 
10% 
of 
the 
investment 
program; 
and 
(c) 
future projects 
will 
be 
prepared 
to 
ensure 
that 
investments 
can attract 
financing 
and 
be 
supported 
by 
the Customer 
Tariff. 
B. 
Strategic 
Context 
1. 
Sector-related 
Country 
Assistance 
Strategy (CAS) 
goal supported 
by 
the 
project 
Document number: 
20728-TA 
Date 
of 
latest 
CAS 
discussion: 
06/30/2000 
The 
Government 
has 
prepared 
a 
Tanzania Assistance Strategy 
(TAS) 
and 
a 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy Paper 
(PRSP) 
in 
parallel 
to 
the 
Country 
Assistance 
Strategy (CAS). 
The 
TAS 
provides 
a 
development 
framework 
to 
organize 
donor 
assistance 
around strategic 
priorities; 
currently 
only 
about 
50% 
of 
external 
aid 
is 
accounted 
for 
by 
the budget. 
The 
PRSP focuses 
on 
specific 
policies 
and 
institutional 
changes 
for 
reducing poverty 
and 
improving 
living 
standards 
in 
the short 
and 
medium 
term. 
The 
development 
targets 
in 
both 
the 
PRSP 
and 
the 
TAS 
are 
consistent 
with 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals 
(MDG) 
of 
reducing 
by 
half 
the 
percentage 
of 
the 
population 
without 
access 
to 
WSS 
services 
by 
2015. 
The 
CAS, 
whose 
preparation 
has 
involved 
consultations 
with 
a 
large 
number 
of 
stakeholders, focuses 
on 
higher 
growth, 
poverty 
reduction, 
and 
institutional reforms 
to 
improve 
governance 
and 
service 
delivery. 
The 
CAS 
shares 
the 
main 
strategic 
directions 
of 
the 
TAS, 
i.e., 
adherence 
to 
macro 
stability, 
improved 
governance, 
increased 
poverty 
focus, 
and 
increased 
private 
sector 
participation 
in 
the 
economy. 
Page  7
It 
also 
supports 
the 
Government‘s 
desire 
to 
enter 
into 
new 
relationships 
with 
partners, 
based 
on 
the 
phased 
switching 
from 
projects 
to 
programs 
for 
a 
more 
effective and 
efficient 
use 
of 
aid 
resources. 
2. 
Main 
sector 
issues 
and 
Government 
strategy: 
Main 
sector 
issues 
2.1 
its 
present 
needs, 
but 
availability 
of 
water 
is 
uneven among 
regions, 
and 
in 
some 
river 
basins, 
water 
is 
becoming 
scarce 
and 
a source 
of 
conflicts. 
Major 
urban 
centers 
such 
as 
Dar 
es 
Salaam 
have 
water 
supplies 
with 
inadequate 
storage 
which 
makes 
them 
vulnerable 
to 
both 
drought and 
floods. 
Conflicts 
between 
the 
water 
supply, 
energy, 
livestock 
and 
agricultural 
sub-sectors are 
growing. 
Soil 
erosion 
and 
sediment 
deposition that result 
from 
poor land 
use 
have 
modified 
runoff 
patterns, damaged 
WSS and 
irrigation 
infrastructure and 
degraded 
quality 
of 
water 
used 
for 
urban 
supplies. 
The implications 
of 
poor land 
use 
are 
significant 
in 
the 
semi-arid and 
arid 
internal 
drainage 
basins. 
Pollution 
from 
inadequately treated 
municipal, 
industrial 
and 
mining 
effluents 
and 
agricultural 
runoff 
is 
contributing 
to 
the 
degradation 
of 
river quality 
and eutrophication 
of 
Lake 
Victoria, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
Mzimbazi 
Creek 
in 
Dar 
es 
Salaam. 
Uncontrolled 
land 
use 
and 
river 
regulation 
have 
degraded 
hydrologically 
important 
and 
productive wetland 
systems. 
Poor 
flood 
control 
management has 
resulted 
in 
damage 
to 
major 
infrastructure, 
including 
the 
water pipelines 
supplying 
Dar 
es 
Salaam. 
Groundwater 
pumping 
is 
uncontrolled 
and 
this 
has 
a 
strong 
potential 
for 
causing 
irreversible 
damage 
through 
saltwater 
intrusion. 
Weak 
policy 
framework, 
fragmented 
water 
resources management, 
poor 
cross 
sectoral 
coordination, 
inadequate 
participation 
of 
stakeholders 
in 
river 
basin 
planning, 
inadequate 
treatment 
of 
water 
as 
an 
economic 
good 
and 
to 
a lesser 
extent 
uncoordinated donor 
support 
are 
key 
issues 
to 
address. 
Water 
resource 
management 
(WM): 
Overall, 
Tanzania 
has 
sufficient 
surface 
and 
ground 
water 
to 
meet 
2.2 
water. 
At 
the 
beginning 
of 
1997, 
urban 
water 
systems 
managed 
by 
the 
then 
Ministry 
of 
Water 
(now 
Ministry 
of 
Water 
and 
Livestock 
Development, 
MWLD), 
were 
handed 
over 
to 
independent 
and 
autonomous 
Urban 
Water 
and 
Sewerage 
Authorities (UWSA). 
Local 
Boards 
set 
consumer 
tariffs 
and 
UWSAs 
are 
expected 
to 
meet 
O&M 
costs; 
however, 
most 
UWSAs 
still 
rely 
on 
MWLD 
subsidies 
to 
cover 
them, 
as 
well 
as 
on 
MWLD 
staff. 
The 
service 
is 
still 
unreliable and 
the 
water 
delivered 
often 
unsafe 
for 
drinking. 
Maintenance 
is rarely 
funded 
due 
to 
low 
tariffs. 
Commercial 
and 
financial 
performances 
are 
slowly 
improving. 
Less 
than 
10% 
of 
the 
urban 
population 
is 
connected 
to 
a sewerage system. 
Another 
lo%, 
mostly 
in 
the 
middle 
and 
upper-income 
group 
use 
septic 
tanks, 
leaving 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
population 
dependent 
on 
pit 
latrines. 
Sanitation 
services are 
largely 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
various 
municipal 
councils 
but 
sewerage operations, 
when 
they 
exist, 
are 
under 
the 
UWSA. 
Due 
to 
poor 
maintenance, 
most 
sewerage 
and 
waste 
water treatment 
facilities 
are 
not 
functioning. 
Pit 
emptying 
services are 
often 
inadequate, 
and 
health 
risks 
result 
from 
manual 
emptying 
most 
latrine 
users 
resort 
to. 
Cholera 
outbreaks 
are 
common 
in 
most urban 
centers. 
Urban 
WSS: 
In 
2002, about 
70% 
of 
the 
urban population 
of 
6.0 
million 
had 
some 
kind 
of 
access 
to 
piped 
2.3 
have 
suffered 
from limited 
community participation 
in 
the 
planning 
of 
facilities 
and 
community 
financial 
contribution 
to 
both 
O&M 
and 
capital 
costs. 
After 
three 
decades 
of 
a 
“supply 
driven” 
approach, 
only 
50% 
of 
the 
rural 
population 
is 
served 
by 
a 
functioning 
system. 
As 
a result, 
most 
of 
the 
rural 
population 
still 
obtain 
its 
water 
from 
unprotected 
sources 
of 
doubtful 
quality; 
during 
the 
dry 
season, 
women 
have 
to 
walk 
long 
distances 
to 
fetch 
water. 
Information 
on 
rural 
sanitation 
is 
limited; 
only 
a 
part 
of 
the 
rural 
population 
has 
access 
to 
traditional 
pit 
latrines 
and 
incidence 
of 
water-borne 
diseases 
is 
high. 
Rural 
WSS: 
Large 
scale 
rural 
WSS 
schemes, 
traditionally 
supported 
by 
external 
donors 
since 
the 
1950s, 
GOT

water 
resources 
assessment 
which identified 
priority 
basins 
and 
a range 
of 
issues at 
the national 
level requiring 
special attention.  Since 
1994, 
GOT 
has 
restructured 
MWLD 
and 
changed 
its 
role 
from 
that 
of 
a 
service 
provider 
to 
a 
regulator 
and 
a 
facilitator. 
GOT 
is 
currently 
implementing 
the 
IDA-financed River 
Basin 
Management and 
Smallholder 
Irrigation 
Improvement 
Project, 
which 
also provides 
for 
the 
development 
of 
a 
WRM 
sections 
of 
the 
National 
Water 
Policy.  Through 
GEF/IDA 
support, 
and 
in 
conjunction 
with 
the Governments 
of 
Kenya 
and 
Uganda, 
GOT 
is 
implementing 
the 
Lake 
Victoria 
Environmental 
Management 
Project 
(LVEMP) 
to 
address 
the 
management 
of 
the 
lake 
ecosystem. 
With 
IDA 
support, 
GOT 
is 
implementing 
the 
Lower 
Kihansi 
EMP 
Project 
to 
address a 
significant 
water 
use 
conflict 
between the 
needs 
for 
power 
generation 
and 
ecosystem maintenance 
as 
well 
WRM: 
GOT 
has 
adopted 
a phased 
approach 
to 
address 
WRM 
challenges. 
In 
1993, 
it 
prepared 
a 
rapid

as 
institutional reforms 
for 
managing 
the 
water-environment.  Tanzania 
is 
also 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Nile 
Basin 
Initiative 
(NBI) 
and 
has 
been instrumental 
in 
developing 
the 
Shared 
Vision 
strategy 
for 
the 
basin.

UWSA 
comes 
from 
the 
German, 
Chinese 
and 
British 
governments, 
the 
European 
Community 
and 
IDA 
under 
the 
Urban 
Sector 
Rehabilitation 
Project 
(USRP 
Cr. 
2867-TA). 
In 
order 
to 
support 
decentralization 
of 
operations 
and 
decision making, the 
following 
legislation 
was 
enacted 
in 
February 
1997; 
(a) 
Water 
Utilization 
Act 
(Control 
& 
Regulation); 
(b) 
creation 
of 
DAWASA; 
and (c) 
update 
of 
the 
Water 
Works 
Ordinance 
for 
merging 
water 
supply 
and 
sewerage 
under 
a single authority.  Under 
the 
latter 
ordinance, 
the 
private 
sector 
can 
be 
associated 
with 
the 
provision 
of 
WSS 
service. 
GOT 
unwritten 
policy 
for 
urban sanitation 
of 
"self 
provision" 
is 
justified 
by 
the 
limited 
capacity 
of 
public 
infrastructure 
and 
responsible 
agencies. 
On-site sanitation 
is 
still 
based 
on 
self 
provision 
with 
regulation 
by 
the 
health 
departments 
of 
the 
municipal 
councils. 
The 
most significant 
policy 
change 
has 
been 
the 
transfer 
of 
sewerage 
services 
from 
the 
municipal 
councils 
to 
the 
UWSA. 
Urban 
WSS: 
About 
18 
urban 
water 
supply 
systems are 
now 
under 
the 
management 
of 
UWSA. 
Support 
to 
2.6 
Rural 
WSS: 
Since 
199 
1, 
GOT policy 
has 
been 
to 
move away 
from 
"free 
water 
for 
all" 
and 
to 
promote 
community 
management. 
The 
rural 
water 
component 
of 
the 
National 
Water 
Policy 
drafted 
finalized 
in 
October 
2002 
calls 
for 
the 
provision 
of 
rural 
WSS 
services 
through: 
(a) 
community 
planning 
and management; 
(b) 
private 
provision 
of 
goods, 
works 
and services; 
and 
(c) 
public 
sector 
regulation, 
facilitation 
and 
environmental 
management. 
Demand 
from 
community, 
cost sharing 
and 
decentralization 
of 
management 
and 
implementation 
at 
the 
lowest 
level 
possible 
are 
the 
pillars 
of 
the 
new policy. 
In 
March 
2002, 
IDA 
approved a 
Rural 
WSS 
project (Cr. 
3623-TA), 
designed 
as 
a 
fxst 
phase 
of 
a national 
RWSS 
program.

by 
the

strategic 
choices: 
Sector 
issues 
to 
be 
addressed 
3.1 
main 
schemes 
(Upper 
and 
Lower 
Ruvu) 
and also 
from 
a small 
surface 
water 
scheme 
(Mtoni).  Boreholes 
fitted 
with 
electric 
or 
hand 
pumps 
have 
recently 
been 
developed 
in 
the 
city 
to 
alleviate 
the 
effect 
of 
low 
flows 
in 
the 
Ruvu 
river; 
but 
the 
safe 
yield 
of 
the 
aquifer 
is 
unknown 
and 
quality 
of 
the 
water 
is 
doubtful. 
Based 
on 
the 
Household Budget 
Survey 
(HBS) 
of 
200012001, 
about 
85% 
of 
city's 
population 
has 
some 
kind 
of 
access 
to 
piped 
water 
supply. 
However, 
the 
service 
is 
erratic 
with 
most 
households 
getting 
it 
less 
than 
six 
hours 
per 
day. 
Over 
45% 
of 
the 
households 
buy 
water 
from 
neighbors, tanker 
trucks 
or from 
vendors. 
The 
total 
production capacity 
of 
about 
273,000 
m3lday 
from 
surface 
water 
plus up 
to 
30,000 
m3lday 
from 
groundwater, 
is 
likely 
to 
be 
sufficient 
to 
supply 
a 
city 
of 
3.0 
million, 
a 
population 
Dar 
es 
Salaam 
is 
likely 
to 
reach 
in 
2007. 
The 
Upper 
Ruvu 
treatment 
plant 
(82,000 
m3/day) 
was 
rehabilitated 
in 
the 
mid-1980s. 
The 
Lower 
Ruvu 
treatment 
plant 
(182,000 m3/day), 
built 
in 
the 
mid 
1970s, 
is 
practically 
out 
of 
order 
and water 
produced 
is 
in 
fact 
not 
adequately 
treated. 
Only 
a 
fraction 
of 
the 
total 
production 
of 
the 
two 
Ruvu 
schemes 
reaches 
the 
city 
because 
of 
offtakes 
on 
the 
two 
50 
km 
transmission 
lines, 
often 
illegal 
and/or 
for irrigation 
purpose. 
The transmission 
lines 
have 
many 
weak 
points 
and 
can 
burst anytime; 
the 
1999 
and 
2002 floods 
washed 
away 
sections 
of 
the 
Lower 
Ruvu 
transmission 
mains and created 
water shortages 
for 
over 
a 
million 
people 
for 
almost 
10 
days. 
The 
primary distribution network 
is 
sufficiently 
developed, 
but 
because 
of 
poor 
balancing 
and 
limited 
coverage 
of 
secondary 
distribution, many neighborhoods 
have 
to 
rely 
on 
long 
- 
and 
sometimes 
unofficial 
- 
individual 
connections. 
Poor 
piped 
water service 
has 
encouraged 
a very active 
water 
vending "industry" 
and 
the 
development 
of 
the 
above 
mentioned 
boreholes. 
Overall 
management 
of 
Dar 
es 
Salaam 
main 
source 
of 
water 
(the 
Ruvu/Wami 
River 
Basin) 
needs 
to 
be strengthened. 
Several 
options 
for Dar 
es 
Salaam 
future 
raw 
water 
source have been 
identified, 
but 
no 
decision 
can 
be 
made 
before 
an 
independent 
regional 
environmental 
impact 
assessment 
is 
carried 
out. 
Once 
a decision 
is 
made 
there 
will 
be 
a 
need 
to 
thoroughly 
prepare 
a 
program 
to 
extend 
water 
storage, 
production, transmission 
and 
main 
distribution 
to 
meet 
a 
demand 
expected 
to 
be 
multiplied 
by 
1.5 
before 
20 
15. 
Dar 
es 
Salaam 
water 
supply: 
Dar 
es 
Salaam 
obtains 
most 
of 
its 
water 
from 
the 
Ruvu 
river 
through 
two 
3.2 
systems 
that consist 
of 
140 
km 
of 
sewers 
connected 
to 
either 
an ocean 
outfall or to 
nine 
decentralized 
waste 
water 
stabilization 
ponds. 
About 
20% 
of 
the 
total 
population 
use 
septic tanks 
and 70% 
use 
pit 
latrines. 
Septage 
from 
septic 
tanks and 
some 
pit 
latrines 
- 
due 
in 
part 
to 
the 
high 
water 
table 
in 
many 
parts 
of 
the 
city 
- 
is 
disposed 
of 
through 
tipping 
stations connected 
to 
the 
stabilization 
ponds and 
the 
ocean 
outfall. 
In 
fact, 
the 
waste 
water treatment 
infrastructure 
serves 
indirectly 
a 
much 
larger 
proportion 
of 
the 
population 
than 
that 
connected 
to 
sewers.

sewerage 
infrastructure 
built 
in 
the

1980s 
is 
at 
various 
stages 
of 
collapse.  Because 
none 
of

operate, 
raw

overflows 
in 
storm

The

of 
the 
Dar 
es 
Salaam 
Sewerage 
and 
Sanitation Department 
(DSSD) 
were handover 
to 
DAWASA 
in 
1999.  There 
is 
an 
obvious 
need 
to 
define 
a 
comprehensive 
sanitation 
strategy 
for 
the 
city 
to 
take 
into 
account 
environmental and economic 
issues.

22,000 sewerage customers. 
Water 
produced and distributed 
is 
not 
metered and 
bills 
are 
established 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
estimations; because 
of 
the 
poor 
service 
it 
provides and 
systematic 
overestimation 
of 
consumption, 
only 
about 
50% 
of 
the 
customers 
pay 
their 
water 
bill 
regularly.  The current 
tariff 
varies 
according 
to

category and 
ranges

(US$O.4O/m3) 
for

for non

(average

Key 
policy 
and 
institutional reforms 
supported by the 
project: 
2.1 
Overall framework: 
. 
The 
project 
will 
support 
the reorganization 
of 
the 
provision 
of 
the 
WSS 
service 
in 
the Service 
Area 
that 
has 
recently 
been 
initiated 
by 
GOT 
by 
transforming 
DAWASA 
into 
an “Asset 
Holding 
Authority 
- 
AHA 
sub-contracting the technical and 
commercial 
operations 
to 
a 
private 
“Operator”. 
The 
relations 
between GOT, 
DAWASA, 
the 
Operator, 
the 
Customers 
and the Regulator 
EWURA 
are 
defined 
in 
a series 
of 
documents (Acts, 
contracts 
and 
licenses) 
that constitute 
the 
overall framework 
for 
the 
provision 
of 
the 
WSS 
service 
in 
the 
Service 
Area 
(see 
attached 
graph). 
2.2 
existing 
DAWASA 
into 
an 
Asset 
Holding 
Authority 
(AHA) 
that 
will 
retain the 
name 
of 
DAWASA. 
DAWASA 
will 
remain 
fully 
owned 
by 
GOT 
and 
be 
mostly 
responsible 
for 
financing 
and 
developing 
WSS 
facilities 
in 
the 
Service 
Area, 
DAWASA will 
be 
fully 
established 
as 
AHA 
once 
the 
Operator 
mobilizes, 
but 
its Board 
and 
top 
management 
have already 
been appointed. 
GOT 
and 
DAWASA 
will 
enter 
into 
a 
ten 
year 
“Development Contract” that 
will 
specify conditions 
under 
which 
the 
Capital 
Investment 
Program 
(CIP) 
will 
be financed 
by 
GOT 
and implemented 
by 
DAWASA. 
Since 
the performance 
of 
the Operator 
will 
partly 
depend 
upon 
DAWASA’s 
capacity 
to 
implement 
the 
Development 
Contract 
between 
GOT 
and 
DA 
WASA: 
The 
DAWASA 
Act 
of 
200 
1 
transforms 
the 
Page  11
7 
CIP, the 
Development Contract 
will 
be 
an 
important 
part 
of 
the 
overall 
contractual framework. 
The 
Development 
Contract, 
whose 
draft 
has 
been 
found 
satisfactory, 
will 
be 
signed 
before 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
IDA 
Credit. 
2.3 
Lease 
Contract 
between 
DAWASA 
and 
the 
Operator: 
DAWASA 
has 
signed 
on 
February 
19,2003  a 
ten 
year 
”Lease 
Contract“,  satisfactory 
to 
the 
Bank, 
with 
“City 
Water 
Services 
Ltd.”, 
a 
locally 
incorporated 
private 
Operator. 
GOT 
has 
selected, 
after 
a 
competitive 
process 
satisfactory 
to 
the 
Bank, 
the 
joint 
venture 
“BiwaterIGauff 
(TZ) 
Ltd.” 
from 
the 
UK 
and 
Germany 
to 
become the 
majority 
shareholder 
and 
manager 
of 
the Operator 
for 
the 
duration 
of 
the 
Lease Contract. 
Minority 
shares 
will 
be 
held 
by 
local 
investors. 
The 
authorized 
capital 
of 
the 
Operator 
is 
US$lO.O 
million 
equivalent 
with 
a 
minimum 
US$2.5 
million 
equivalent 
to 
be 
paid 
up 
on 
the 
Commencement 
date 
of 
the 
Lease Contract, 
that 
will 
coincide 
with 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
IDA 
Credit.  The 
Lease 
Contract 
specifies 
conditions 
under 
which 
the 
WSS service 
has 
to 
be 
provided, 
assets 
have 
to 
be 
operated 
and 
maintained, connections have 
to 
be 
provided 
to 
customers, 
consumption 
has 
to 
be 
metered and 
billed, 
and 
bills 
have 
to 
be 
collected. 
The 
Lease 
Contract 
is 
designed 
to 
encourage 
the 
Operator 
to 
maximize 
its 
profits 
by 
reducing 
commercial 
losses, 
through 
improved 
billing 
and collection, 
and 
operating 
costs, 
by 
limiting 
physical 
losses. 
To 
minimize 
coordination problems 
with 
regards 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
CIP, 
DAWASA 
has 
also 
contracted, 
following 
a 
procedure 
acceptable 
to 
the Bank, 
the 
Operator 
to 
implement: 
(a) 
as 
a 
contractor: 
the 
“Priority  Works 
Program” 
including 
the 
supply 
of 
173,000 
individual 
meters; 
and 
(b) 
as 
project 
manager: 
the “Delegated 
Works 
Program 
- 
DWP”. 
2.4 
Contract” 
with 
the 
Operator, 
not 
with 
DAWASA. 
The 
Operator 
will 
bear 
the 
commercial 
risk 
as 
its 
revenues 
will 
come 
only from 
bills 
collected. 
While 
the 
Operator 
is 
expected 
to 
rapidly 
improve collection 
from 
private 
customers, 
its 
performance 
with 
GOT 
agencies 
will 
mostly 
depend 
upon 
proper 
GOT 
budget 
and disbursement 
procedures; 
GOT’S 
new 
procedures 
are 
encouraging. 
Non 
payment 
of 
utility 
bills 
by 
government 
agencies 
that the 
Operator 
may 
not 
be 
able 
to 
disconnect 
may 
require 
remedies 
through 
the 
Regulator. 
Customer 
Contract 
between 
the 
Operator 
and Customers: 
Customers 
will 
enter 
into 
a 
“Customer 
2.5 
Agency 
(EWURA) 
Act. 
EWURA 
will 
“license” 
both 
DAWASA 
and the 
Operator.  Arrangements have 
been 
made 
to allow 
licensing 
in 
case 
EWURA 
is 
not 
yet 
operational 
by 
Effectiveness. 
EWURA 
will 
mostly be 
involved 
in 
the 
adjustments 
of 
the 
Operator 
and 
Customer 
Tariffs 
and 
the 
overall 
monitoring 
of 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
WSS 
service. 
EWURA’s 
role 
should 
initially 
be 
limited 
since 
both 
tariffs 
are supposed 
to 
be 
fixed for 
a 
period 
of 
five 
years. 
In 
fact, 
because 
of 
the 
poor 
baseline 
data 
on 
which 
the 
Operator 
Tariff 
has 
been 
established, requests 
for 
tariff 
adjustments are 
likely 
to 
occur 
before 
the 
mandatory renegotiation 
of 
year 
five. 
EWURA 
activities 
will 
be 
funded 
by 
a 
levy 
included 
in 
the 
Customer 
Tariff. 
Technical 
Assistance 
(TA) 
to 
EWURA 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
financed 
from 
either 
another 
IDA 
supported 
project 
or 
bi-lateral 
sources. 
EWURA 
will 
employ 
technical, 
financial and economic 
consultants, 
inspectors 
or 
auditors, 
as 
required. 
Licenses 
granted 
by 
the 
Regulator: 
In 
200 
1, 
GOT 
passed 
the Energy and 
Water 
Utilities 
Regulatory 
2.6 
“Operator 
Tariff’ 
retained 
by 
the 
Operator; 
the 
“DAWASA 
Tariff’ 
collected 
by 
the 
Operator 
on 
behalf 
of 
DAWASA; 
and 
a 
“Social Connection 
Tariff’ to 
be 
deposited 
in 
the 
“First 
Time 
Domestic 
Water 
Supply Connection 
Fund”. 
The Water 
Customer 
Tariff 
is 
designed 
to 
favor connection 
to 
and consumption 
of 
piped 
water 
by 
low 
income 
households. 
To 
that effect, 
new 
domestic connections 
for 
low 
income 
households 
will 
be 
funded 
by 
the 
Connection 
Fund 
and 
the 
first 
five 
cubic 
meters 
consumed 
each 
month 
by 
domestic 
customers 
will 
only 
be 
charged 
the Operator 
Tariff. 
The 
“Sewerage 
Customer 
Tariff’ 
will 
be 
a 
two-part 
tariff 
consisting 
of 
an Operator 
Tariff 
and 
a 
DAWASA 
Tariff 
charged 
on 
80% 
of 
the 
water 
consumption 
to 
customers connected 
to 
the 
sewerage system. 
The 
Operator 
Tariffs 
are 
supposed 
to 
remain 
fixed 
in 
real 
terms 
for 
five 
years, 
and 
adjusted 
annually 
using 
the 
cost 
index 
formula 
of 
the 
Lease Contract, 
to 
reflect inflation. 
The 
Lease 
Contract 
describes 
the 
mechanisms 
that 
will 
apply 
to 
review 
the 
Operator 
Tariff 
during 
the 
initial five 
year 
period 
of 
the 
Lease Contract: 
(a) 
annual 
review: 
to 
adjust 
the 
cost 
index 
formula 
or 
assumptions 
made 
when 
establishing 
the 
bid 
price; 
(b) 
interim 
review: 
to 
take 
care 
of 
material 
changes 
of 
circumstance; 
and 
(c) 
the 
major review: 
to 
set 
the 
tariff 
that 
will 
apply 
for 
the 
second 
five 
year 
period 
of 
the 
Lease 
Contract. 
DAWASA 
revenues, 
consisting 
principally 
of 
the 
DAWASA 
Tariffs 
and 
the 
“Rental 
Fee” 
charged 
to 
the 
Operator 
for 
use 
of 
the 
assets, 
will 
cover 
DAWASA’s 
operating 
costs, 
debt 
service 
and contribute 
to 
the 
CIP. 
DAWASA 
Tariffs 
will 
be 
adjusted 
annually 
to 
reflect inflation. 
Customer 
Tariff  structure: 
The 
“Water  Customer 
Tariff’ 
will 
be 
a 
three 
part 
tariff 
consisting

Benefits 
and 
target 
population: 
The 
main 
benefits 
of 
the 
project 
will 
be: 
(a) 
the 
improved 
reliability 
of 
the 
WSS 
service 
as 
a 
result 
of 
a 
coordinated 
program 
of 
rehabilitation 
of 
operations 
and facilities; 
(b) 
an 
increased 
affordability 
of 
the WSS 
service 
by 
lower 
income 
groups 
who 
will 
be 
able 
to 
switch 
from 
current 
expensive 
private 
supplies, such 
as 
tankers 
and 
vendors, 
to 
public 
piped 
water, 
have 
access 
to 
the 
Connection 
Fund, 
and 
benefit 
from 
an 
adapted 
Customer 
Tariff 
structure 
and 
improved metering 
and 
billing 
procedures; 
(c) 
an 
improved 
sustainability 
of 
the 
WSS 
service 
as 
a 
result 
of 
an 
institutional 
arrangement 
with 
built-in 
incentives 
to 
perform 
and 
a 
pricing 
policy 
designed 
to 
recover 
costs 
and 
manage demand; 
(d) 
an 
increased 
implementation 
capacity 
of 
WSS 
projects 
by 
DAWASA 
and 
MWLD; 
and 
(e) 
an 
increased 
regulatory 
capacity 
of 
the 
provision 
of 
the 
WSS 
service. 
Overall 
the 
public health 
situation should 
improve 
as 
a 
result 
of 
a 
more 
permanent 
water 
supply 
service 
and rehabilitation 
of 
waste 
water 
collection 
and 
treatment 
facilities. 
The entire 
population 
of 
Dar 
es 
Salaam 
and most 
of 
its 
economic activities, 
which 
have 
suffered 
from 
unreliable 
public 
WSS 
for 
decades 
and 
have 
to 
rely 
on 
expensive 
private 
substitutes, 
will 
benefit 
from 
the 
project. 
Currently 
75% 
of 
the 
total population 
in 
the Service 
Area 
of 
about 2.6 
million 
obtain 
water a 
few 
days 
per 
week 
only; at 
the 
end of the 
project, 
it 
is 
estimated that about 
80% 
of 
a 
population 
of 
3.2 
million 
will 
have 
access 
to piped 
water and that 
70% 
of 
the 
DAWASA 
service area 
will 
obtain 
a 
24 
hours 
service. 
At 
the 
rate 
of 
increase 
of 
the coverage 
ratio 
and 
improvement 
of 
the 
quality 
of 
service, 
the 
MDG 
of 
reducing 
by 
half 
the 
percentage 
of 
the population 
without 
access 
to 
safe 
water 
and 
adequate 
sanitation 
by 
20 
15 
is likely 
to 
be 
achieved 
provided, 
however, 
that 
the 
production 
capacity 
can 
be 
increased 
by 
about 
20 
10. 
4. 
Institutional 
and 
implementation 
arrangements 
4.1 
project, expected 
to 
cover 
the 
first 
five 
years 
of 
the 
new institutional 
arrangement; 
its 
performance 
under 
the 
IDA 
financed 
USRP 
is 
satisfactory. 
DAWASA, 
as 
AHA, 
will 
primarily 
consist 
of 
two 
main 
departments: a 
“Technical 
Department”  responsible 
for 
managing construction activities and preparing technical 
studies 
and 
a

WSS 
(parallel

AfDB 
identified 
a 
project 
in 
August 
1997 
that 
focused 
on 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
operations 
and facilities, 
with 
DAWASA 
still 
being 
the 
operator. 
AfDB 
put 
processing 
of 
this 
project 
on 
hold 
pending 
the 
outcome 
of 
a 
consultation 
with 
private 
operators/developers 
initiated 
by 
GOT 
late 
in 
1997 
for 
a 
long term 
"Concession". 
Under 
this 
arrangement, 
responsibility 
for 
financing 
an 
investment 
program 
estimated 
to 
cost 
more 
than 
US$300 
million 
to 
develop 
a 
new 
source 
of 
water 
would 
have been transferred 
to 
the 
concessionaire, 
in 
addition 
to 
that 
of 
operating the 
WSS 
service. 
In 
November 
1998, 
when 
it 
became 
clear 
that 
this 
consultation 
was 
not 
going 
to 
succeed, 
GOT 
confmed 
earlier 
requests 
for 
Bank's 
assistance 
to 
help 
design 
an 
option combining 
private 
operation 
and 
public 
financing 
and focusing 
first 
on 
rehabilitation 
of 
WSS 
operations 
and facilities. 
The 
Lease 
Contract 
option 
was 
adopted 
after 
an 
additional 
analysis 
of 
different private 
sector 
participation 
(PSP) 
options 
by 
the 
transaction advisor 
appointed 
by

3. 
Lessons 
learned and reflected 
in 
the 
project 
design: 
3.1 
institutional 
development 
and 
cost 
recovery 
issues; 
but 
with 
the creation 
of 
UWSAs 
and 
the 
formulation 
of 
the 
National 
Water 
policy, 
GOT 
has 
recently 
demonstrated 
a 
willingness 
to 
address these 
issues. 
The 
experience 
with 
UWSAs 
has 
been 
an 
important 
step 
towards accountability, 
but 
it 
is 
too 
early 
to judge 
its 
sustainability, 
taking 
into 
account the 
difficulty 
of 
attracting and 
retaining 
competent 
staff 
for 
each 
UWSA 
and 
of 
reducing 
operating 
costs, 
because 
of 
the 
small 
size 
of 
each 
operation. 
Sub-contracting 
technical 
and 
commercial 
operations 
of 
the 
WSS 
service 
to 
operators 
with 
a 
wider 
geographical 
coverage 
may 
be 
an 
option 
to 
consider. 
WSSprojects 
in 
Tanzania: 
Traditionally, 
urban 
WSS 
projects 
in 
Tanzania 
have 
paid little 
attention 
to 
3.2 
Private sectorparticipation in 
WSS: 
PSP 
in 
WSS 
is 
not 
a 
new 
concept 
in 
Africa. 
In 
CBte 
d'Ivoire,  the 
private 
operator that 
now 
serves 
more 
than 
600,000 
customers 
in 
more 
than 
600 cities 
and towns 
with 
populations 
ranging 
from 
2.5 
million to 
a 
few 
thousands, was 
created 
40 
years ago. 
Senegal, 
Niger, 
Mali 
and South 
Africa 
have 
implemented 
reasonably 
successful 
PSP schemes 
in 
the 
last 
decade.  Cameroon, 
Nigeria 
are 
seeking 
similar 
arrangements. 
A 
review 
of 
the 
regional 
experience 
carried 
out 
early 
during 
project 
preparation 
led 
to 
the 
recommendation 
of: 
(a) 
the 
Lease 
Contract 
option 
transferring the 
commercial 
risk 
to 
the 
Operator; 
(b) 
the 
transformation 
of 
DAWASA 
into 
an 
AHA; 
(c) 
the 
need 
for 
a 
Development 
Contract 
between 
the Government and 
Page  16
12 
the 
AHA; 
(d) 
the 
commitment 
by 
the Government 
to 
cause 
its 
agencies 
to 
pay 
water 
bills 
timely; 
(e) 
transfer 
of 
some 
responsibility 
for 
implementing part 
of 
the 
CIP 
to 
the 
Operator; 
and 
(0 
a 
clear 
definition 
of 
the respective 
roles 
of 
the 
AHA 
and 
the 
Operator 
with 
regards 
to 
the 
financing 
of 
repairs 
and 
replacements. 
3.3 
Other 
lessons: 
Experience 
worldwide 
and 
in 
particular 
in 
Africa 
has also 
demonstrated 
the 
importance 
of: 
(a) 
proper 
pricing 
of 
WSS Service 
to 
manage 
water 
demand, 
in 
particular 
in 
water 
scarce 
areas, 
and 
of 
designing 
a 
tariff 
structure 
to 
allow 
access 
to 
piped 
water 
of 
lower 
income 
groups; 
(b) 
stakeholder 
participation 
in 
the 
design 
of 
institutional 
reform 
to 
build 
a 
strong 
consensus 
on 
the “privatization” 
of 
a 
key 
public 
service; 
(c) 
developing, 
in 
parallel 
to 
the mainstream project, 
specifically 
targeted 
programs 
to 
lower 
income 
communities that 
may 
not 
immediately benefit 
from 
improved 
WSS 
service; 
and 
(d) 
designing 
a 
well 
focused project. 
4. 
Indications 
of 
borrower 
commitment and 
ownership: 
Since 
1997, 
GOT 
has been 
under 
tremendous pressure 
to 
improve 
the WSS service 
in 
Dar 
es 
Salaam. 
When the 
Bank 
was 
requested late 
in 
1998 
to 
provide financial 
support 
to 
the 
project, 
it 
was agreed 
that 
its 
processing 
would 
be 
linked 
to 
the 
“privatization” 
of 
DAWASA’s 
operations. 
Thus 
before 
appraisal, 
GOT 
agreed 
to: 
(a) 
pass 
an 
Act 
to 
reflect 
DAWASA’s 
new 
mandate 
as 
AHA; 
(b) 
prepare 
drafts 
of 
the 
various 
contracts 
that 
will 
constitute the 
framework 
for 
the 
WSS service 
in 
Dar 
es 
Salaam; 
and 
(c) 
select 
an 
IPP 
for 
the 
Operator 
following 
a transparent 
and 
fair 
process. 
A 
first 
bidding 
for 
the 
Lease 
Contract 
was 
organized 
early 
in 
2000 
among 
three 
pre-qualified 
companies (one 
from 
the 
UK, 
two from 
France). 
Despite 
two 
pre-bid 
meetings, the 
UK 
company 
did 
not 
participate 
and the 
two 
French 
companies 
submitted 
qualified 
bids, 
that 
GOT 
refused 
to 
evaluate, 
against 
the 
Bank 
advice. 
GOT 
requested a 
re-bidding 
with 
the objective 
of 
increasing 
competition and 
avoiding 
qualifications. 
The 
same 
three 
companies 
were pre-qualified. 
A 
second 
bidding 
took 
place 
during 
the 
first 
half 
of 
2002 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
a 
revised 
bidding 
document 
including, 
in 
particular, 
the 
PW. 
To 
simplify 
bid 
evaluation, 
bidders 
were 
asked 
to 
bid 
on 
the 
Operator 
Tariff 
only, 
all 
other conditions, 
i.e., 
initial 
equity 
contribution 
to 
the 
capital 
of 
the Operator, 
financial  support 
to 
the Operator’s start-up activities, 
fees 
for 
managing the 
DWP 
and amount 
to 
be 
paid 
by 
DAWASA 
for 
the 
PWP, 
being 
identical 
for 
all 
bidders. 
The 
Bidding 
Document 
also 
include 
a 
formula 
to 
protect 
GOT 
against 
artificially 
low 
bidding. 
Despite 
two 
pre-bid 
meetings, 
two 
pre-qualified 
still 
disagree 
on 
several 
clauses 
of 
the 
draft 
Lease Contract, 
and 
only 
one 
bid 
was 
received 
from 
BiwaterlGauff. 
Despite 
the 
major 
delay 
in 
selecting 
the 
IPP, 
GOT 
has 
demonstrated 
its 
ability to 
prepare a 
complex 
and 
well 
focused 
project, 
draft 
a 
detailed 
PIP 
and 
ensure 
that construction activities can 
start 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
financing 
becomes available. 
5. 
Value 
added 
of 
Bank 
support 
in 
this 
project: 
The 
Bank 
is 
probably 
the 
only 
financing 
agency 
that 
has 
been 
actively 
involved 
in 
supporting “privatization” 
of 
WSS operations 
in 
Africa 
during 
the 
last 
two 
decades. 
Throughout 
preparation, 
it 
has 
provided 
constant assistance 
to 
GOT. 
The 
Bank 
also 
is 
the 
only 
financing 
agency 
that 
can 
provide 
GOT 
with 
the 
assistance needed 
to 
implement 
an 
institutional 
arrangement 
likely 
to 
require 
several 
fine 
tunings 
during 
the 
coming 
years. 
The 
Bank 
has 
been 
able 
to 
attract 
significant co-financing 
to 
the 
project, 
and 
will 
continue 
its 
coordination 
role 
during 
implementation. 
The 
Bank 
will 
also 
help 
prepare a 
technically 
complex 
future 
WSS project 
for 
Dar 
es 
Salaam.

water 
directly 
through new private 
connections 
and 
an 
increased 
number 
of 
standposts; 
(b) 
direct 
expenditure savings 
by 
existing 
consumers 
currently 
charged 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
assessed 
consumption, 
who 
will

Overview: 
The 
economic 
analysis 
builds 
on 
the 
financial 
analysis 
that 
measures 
flows 
of 
costs 
and 
Page  17
13 
savings 
by 
existing 
and 
new 
consumers 
relying 
on 
standposts 
and new 
domestic 
customers 
who 
will 
be 
connected 
to 
piped 
water. 
1.2 
will 
become available 
for 
consumption 
through 
the 
reduction 
of 
UfW, 
from 
the current 
58% 
to 
25% 
by 
20 
13. 
It 
is, 
therefore, 
critical 
that 
targets 
for 
reducing 
UfW 
be 
achieved 
as 
planned 
in 
the 
Lease 
Contract. 
The 
project 
will: 
(a) 
improve 
the 
quality 
and 
reliability 
of 
service 
to 
the 
existing 
100,000 
(of 
which 
87,000 
are supposed 
to 
be 
active) 
domestic connections, 
serving 
about one 
million 
people, 
and 
1,000 
standposts, 
serving an 
estimated 
additional 
one 
million; 
(b) 
increase 
water 
coverage 
by 
serving an 
additional 
385,000 
people through direct 
connections, 
300,000 
through 
standposts, 
and 
170,000 
through 
Community 
WSS 
facilities 
by 
2008; 
(c) 
lead 
to 
a 
more 
equitable service 
by 
allowing 
direct 
access 
to 
piped 
water 
through 
individual 
connections 
by 
households 
currently 
relying 
on 
neighbors 
and/or vendors; 
(d) 
improve 
revenue 
collection 
as 
a 
result 
of 
institutional 
restructuring and improvement 
in 
the 
utility’s 
operating efficiency; 
and; 
(e) 
gradually introduce 
a 
more efficient pricing. 
Benefits: 
The 
identified 
project benefits 
are 
mainly 
predicated 
on 
the 
incremental 
quantity 
of 
water 
that 
1.3 
project through 
the: 
(a) 
establishment 
of 
the 
Connection 
Fund, 
replenished 
from 
the 
Customer 
Tariff, 
to 
finance 
small 
diameter domestic 
connections; 
(b) 
densification and 
extension 
of 
the 
secondary 
distribution network 
that 
will 
allow 
the construction 
of 
connections 
and 
standposts; (c) 
adoption 
of 
a 
“lifeline” 
tariff 
for 
the 
first 
five 
cubic 
meters 
per 
month 
(5 
m3/month) 
consumed 
by 
domestic 
customers; 
(d) 
Community 
WSS component 
aimed 
at 
providing 
improved 
WSS 
services 
to 
about 
50 
low 
income 
communities 
that cannot 
rapidly 
be 
reached 
andor 
where 
distribution networks 
cannot 
be 
developed 
rapidly. 
Improvement 
of 
WSS 
for 
low 
income 
households: 
Low 
income communities 
will 
benefit 
from 
the 
1.4 
US$280m (which 
includes 
increasing water 
production through 
a 
new 
water 
treatment 
plant 
and 
a 
major 
sewerage 
investment) 
would be 
needed 
during 
the second 
half 
of 
the 
Lease. 
While 
these 
figures 
are 
only 
indicative, 
a 
preliminary 
estimate 
of 
the average 
incremental 
costs 
(AIC) 
as 
a 
proxy 
to 
the 
LRMC 
has 
been 
made, 
using 
this 
medium term 
CIP 
and 
a 
discount rate 
of 
10%. 
The 
AIC 
is 
about 
Tshs950/m3 
(US$1 
.O/m3). 
Consumers 
should 
react 
to 
this 
price 
as 
inefficient 
consumption, that 
can 
exhaust 
current 
capacity, 
would 
necessitate a 
capacity 
expansion 
sooner. 
The 
LRMC 
suggests 
that 
some 
tariff 
increases 
would 
be 
required 
in 
the future. 
The 
medium 
term 
CIP 
would 
be confirmed 
during 
the 
project 
(component 
5) 
and 
the 
LRMC 
more 
accurately estimated 
by 
EWRA 
during 
its 
review 
of 
the 
future 
Customer 
Tariff 
for 
the 
second 
half 
of 
the 
Lease. 
Long run marginal 
cost

Available 
information 
suggests 
that

and

2.1 
first 
analyzed 
for 
consistency 
with 
the 
technical proposal 
and 
viability 
of 
the 
company. 
Detailed financial 
forecasts 
of 
DAWASA 
and 
the Operator 
were 
then prepared 
to 
analyze 
the 
likely 
impact 
of 
the 
project 
on 
their 
financial 
sustainability. 
Key 
drivers 
of 
financial sustainability were also 
identified 
and 
the magnitude 
of 
their 
likely 
impact 
assessed. 
Finally, 
an 
investment 
analysis was 
carried out 
to 
assess 
the 
rates 
of 
return 
from 
the incremental benefits 
of 
the project. 
Below 
is 
a 
summary 
of 
Annex 
5. 
Overview: 
Financial 
projections submitted 
by 
the 
Operator 
as 
part 
of 
its 
bid 
for 
the Lease 
Contract were 
2.2 
the 
timely 
increase 
of 
the 
volume 
of 
water 
available 
for 
consumption.  Transmission and 
distribution 
losses are 
assumed 
to 
decrease 
from 
the 
current estimated 
40% 
and 
36% 
to 
12% 
and 
19% 
respectively, 
leading 
to 
a 
global 
reduction 
in 
UfW 
from 
57% 
to 
25%, 
assuming 
full 
billing. 
Other 
assumptions made 
rests 
with 
the 
ability 
of 
the 
Operator 
to 
improve 
the 
overall 
commercial performance 
and 
include, 
as 
specified 
in 
the 
Lease 
Contract: 
(a) 
metering 
of 
all 
customers 
by 
the 
end 
of 
year 
five; 
(b) 
billing 
of 
customers 
on 
actual 
meter 
reading 
by 
year 
five; 
(c) 
improvement 
of 
the 
collection 
rate 
from 
the 
current 
estimated 
48% 
to 
over 
90%; 
and 
(d) 
growth 
in 
the 
number 
of 
active 
connections. 
Key 
assumptions: 
Assumptions 
are 
predicated 
on 
the 
timely 
delivery 
of 
the 
CIP 
and, 
as 
a consequence, 
2.3 
show that 
both 
DAWASA 
and 
the 
Operator 
will 
remain 
financially 
viable 
for 
the duration 
of 
the 
ten-year 
Lease 
Contract. 
DAWASA’s 
internal 
cash 
generation 
capacity 
will 
be 
adequate 
to 
contribute 
about 
10% 
counterpart 
financing  towards 
the 
project 
cost. 
Cashflow 
from 
operations 
will 
however 
be 
initially 
weak and 
improve 
only 
after 
the 
third 
year. 
Key 
drivers 
affecting project 
cashflows and sustainability include: 
(a) 
timely 
payment 
of 
committed 
Financialprojections: 
Pro-forma financial 
statements, 
presented 
in 
local 
currency and

funding 
of 
the Operator and 
DAWASA; 
(b) 
reduction 
of 
transmission 
and 
distribution 
losses; 
(c) 
achievement 
of 
full 
billing 
of 
customers; 
(d) 
improvement 
in 
collection 
efficiency; and 
(e) 
adaptation 
to 
changes 
in 
volumes 
of 
water 
on 
which 
bills 
are 
established 
once 
metering 
is 
effective. 
2.4 
Return 
(FIRR) 
of 
the 
project 
for 
the 
combined 
DAWASNOperator 
operations, 
using 
a 
with 
and 
without project 
methodology, 
are 
estimated 
at about 
Tshs60bn (US$62 
million 
equivalent) 
and 
20% 
respectively. 
A 
sensitivity 
analysis, 
modeled 
to 
take 
into 
account 
risks 
identified 
in 
Section 
F, 
envisages 
two 
main 
scenarios: 
(a) 
failure 
of 
GOT 
to pay 
its 
WSS 
bills 
and failure 
of 
the 
Operator 
to 
improve overall 
collection; and 
(b) 
delayed 
delivery 
of 
the 
immediate 
CIP 
leading 
to 
slower improvements 
in 
the 
facilities. 
Its 
results show 
that 
the 
project’s 
FIRR 
are 
relatively 
robust 
to 
such 
changes, 
implying 
that the 
critical 
project 
success 
criteria 
rests 
with 
the 
ability 
to 
sustain 
DAWASA 
and 
the 
Operator 
as 
viable 
operations, 
in 
particular 
during 
the 
initial 
three 
years 
of 
the project. 
Investment 
analysis: 
The 
financial 
Net 
Present 
Value (FNPV) 
- 
using 
a 
10% 
discount rate 
- 
and 
Rates 
of 
2.5 
to 
support the 
immediate 
CIP; such 
Customer 
Tariffs 
compare 
with 
that 
charged 
in 
large 
African 
cities 
with 
efficient 
WSS 
operations. 
A 
medium 
term 
capital 
expenditure 
program 
will 
be 
needed 
towards 
the 
end 
of 
the 
ten 
year 
Lease. 
During 
the project, 
DAWASA 
will 
review 
in 
detail 
this 
program; 
such 
program, 
including 
its 
financing 
plan, 
need 
to 
be 
taken 
into 
account 
during 
the 
independent 
tariff 
review 
by 
EWURA 
in 
2007. 
Cost 
recovery: 
The 
Customer 
Tariffs 
proposed 
for 
the 
first 
five 
years 
of 
the 
Lease 
Contract, 
is 
adequate 
2.6 
The 
project 
will 
yield 
a 
small 
fiscal 
surplus 
(US$13.0 
million) 
over 
the 
length 
of 
the 
Credits and 
Loans. 
But 
this 
figure 
does 
not 
take 
into 
account 
that 
without 
the project, 
facilities 
would 
deteriorate 
further resulting 
in 
additional 
costs 
to 
GOT 
to 
compensate 
for 
accumulated 
deferred 
maintenance. 
GOT 
agencies 
are 
expected 
to promptly 
pay 
their 
water 
bills 
under 
the 
project. 
GOT 
borrowings, 
estimated 
to 
a 
total 
of 
about 
$144.0 
million, 
represents 
about 
2% 
of 
Tanzania’s 
total 
debt outstanding 
and 
disbursed 
(2001 
figures). 
Annual 
debt 
service 
after 
the 
grace 
period 
is 
about 
US$S.Om 
which 
adds 
about 
1.5% 
to 
the 
country’s 
total 
debt 
service 
payments (200 
1 figures). 
Fiscal 
Impact: 
A 
detailed discussion 
of 
the 
fiscal impact 
of 
the 
project 
on 
GOT 
can 
be found 
in 
Annex 
5. 
3. 
Technical: 
The 
project 
will 
mostly 
rehabilitate 
existing 
water 
production, 
transmission 
and 
distribution 
supply 
facilities 
to 
restore 
their 
initial 
capacity 
and 
outputs 
quality. 
Initial 
designs 
of 
these 
facilities 
were 
adequate, 
but 
the 
absence 
of 
maintenance 
over 
the 
years has 
led 
to 
major 
degradation. 
The 
project 
is 
also 
expected 
to 
upgrade 
about 
135,000 
existing 
connections 
(87,000 
active, 
13,000 
inactive and an 
estimated 
35,000 
illegal 
connections),  create 35,000 
new 
connections, 
install 
about 173,000 meters 
and 
lay 
a 
total 
of 
about 
960 
km 
of 
primary 
and 
secondary 
pipes 
with 
the 
main 
objective 
of 
reducing 
UfW, 
a 
large 
part 
of 
which 
is 
suspected 
to 
come 
from 
physical 
leaks 
on 
very 
long 
individual 
and 
sometimes 
illegal 
connections, 
and 
expanding 
the customer 
base. 
The project 
will 
also 
rehabilitate 
existing 
sewers, 15 
pumping 
stations 
and 
nine 
stabilization 
ponds. 
The 
treatment 
capacity 
of 
the latter 
has 
recently 
been 
reassessed 
and 
limited 
modifications 
have 
been 
included 
in 
their 
design 
to 
meet expected 
increased 
load. 
Only 
limited 
extensions 
(26 
km)of 
the 
secondary sewers 
will 
be included 
in 
the 
project. 
Detailed 
designs and cost 
estimates, 
initially 
prepared 
in 
1995, 
have been 
updated; 
bidding 
documents have 
been 
prepared 
by 
engineering 
consultants 
financed 
by 
PPA. 
The 
project 
will 
not 
increase 
abstraction 
from 
the 
Ruvu 
river. 
The 
project 
will 
however 
provide 
consultants services 
for: 
(a) 
assessing 
the 
ground 
water 
potential 
in 
Dar 
es 
Salaam 
and 
along 
the 
transmission lines; 
(b) 
reviewing 
future 
raw 
water 
sources 
options and preparing related comprehensive 
environmental 
assessments; (c) 
preparing 
designs 
for 
the 
extension 
of 
the 
production 
and transmission and 
main 
distribution 
capacities; 
(d) 
preparing 
a 
sanitation 
strategic 
plan; 
and 
(e) 
a 
national 
strategy 
for 
developing urban 
wss. 
4. 
Institutional: 
The 
institutional 
reforms 
described 
above 
took 
place 
as 
part 
of 
project 
preparation. 
4.1 
responsible 
for 
supervising 
the 
components 
related 
to 
water 
resources management 
and 
the 
assistance 
to 
the 
WamiJRuvu 
River 
Basin 
Office 
and 
the 
definition 
of 
the 
strategy 
for 
developing 
WSS 
in 
secondary 
urban 
centers; 
DAWASA 
will 
however 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
selection 
of 
consultants 
and contract 
management. 
Executing 
agencies: 
DAWASA will 
be 
the 
main 
implementing 
agency 
of 
the 
project.

component 
of 
the 
IDA 
financed 
USRP 
(Cr.2867-TA). 
However, 
the 
size 
and 
complexity 
of 
the 
proposed 
project 
justifies 
strong 
TA 
to DAWASA. 
The 
project 
will 
include: 
(a) 
financial and 
engineering 
advisors; 
(b) 
legal 
assistance; (c) 
public 
relation 
assistance; 
(d) 
audits 
of 
financial 
statements 
and 
project 
accounts; 
(e) 
technical 
audits 
of 
performance 
of 
the 
Operator; 
(f) 
a 
revaluation 
of 
assets; 
(g) 
construction supervision 
consultant 
(CSC); 
(h) 
specialized 
NGOs 
for 
implementing 
the 
Community 
WSS 
component; 
(i) 
environmental 
audits; 
(j) 
training 
of 
DAWASA 
Board 
members and 
staff 
and 
MWLD 
staff; 
(k) 
an independent 
assessment 
of 
the institutional 
arrangement, 
to 
be 
carried 
prior 
to 
the 
mid-term review 
of 
the 
project; 
and 
(1) 
a 
HIV/AIDS 
advisor 
on 
a 
part 
time 
basis. 
Outline 
of 
the 
TOR 
and 
budgets 
for 
the 
various 
TA 
included 
in 
the 
project 
have been 
agreed 
upon. 
MWLD 
has 
the 
capacity 
to 
implement 
its 
part 
of 
the 
project. 
Project 
management: 
DAWASA 
is 
already 
satisfactorily 
implementing 
the 
Dar 
es 
Salaam 
water 
supply 
4.3 
Procurement 
issues: 
Following 
the 
reform 
of 
public 
procurement 
in 
Tanzania, 
DAWASA 
will 
be 
fully 
responsible 
for 
procurement and 
will 
not 
have 
to 
rely 
on 
the 
services 
of 
the Central 
Tender 
Board 
whose 
role 
is 
now 
that 
of 
a 
regulatory 
agency. 
The 
assessment 
of 
DAWASA’s 
procurement capacity 
initially 
carried out 
in 
1999 
was 
updated 
during 
appraisal; 
the procurement 
risk 
is 
assessed 
as 
average. 
The 
procurement 
plan 
included 
in 
the 
POM 
has 
been 
agreed 
with all 
financing 
agencies. 
The 
ICB 
procedure 
will 
apply to 
IDA 
financed 
contracts 
above 
US$l,OOO,OOO 
for 
works 
and 
US$300,000 
for 
goods; 
the QCBS 
procedure 
will 
apply 
to 
IDA 
financed 
consultant 
contracts above 
US$lOO,OOO 
for 
firms 
and 
US$50,000 
for 
individuals. 
Prior 
reviews 
by 
the 
Bank 
will 
be carried out 
for 
contracts 
of 
amounts 
above 
US$l,OOO,OOO 
for 
works, 
US$300,000 
for 
goods, 
US$lOO,OOO 
for 
consulting 
firms 
and 
US$50,000 
for 
individual 
consultants. 
Direct 
contracting 
with 
the 
Operator 
andor 
other contractors 
may be 
used 
exclusively 
for 
repairs 
of 
emergency nature that 
DAWASA 
is 
obliged 
to 
finance 
and the 
Operator 
is obliged to 
carry out 
under 
the 
Lease 
Contract, 
within 
the 
limit 
of 
an 
aggregate 
amount 
of 
US$l 
.8 
million. 
Bank 
prior 
review 
will 
be 
required, 
but 
retroactive 
reviews may 
be 
requested 
on 
a 
case 
by 
case 
basis; 
the emergency nature 
of 
the 
works 
will 
be certified 
by 
the 
Auditors 
and 
claims 
for 
payment 
will 
be 
certified 
by 
the 
CSC. 
4.4 
Financial 
management 
issues: 
The 
assessment 
of 
DAWASA’s 
financial 
management 
capacity 
carried 
out 
prior to 
appraisal 
revealed 
a sound 
accounting 
system, 
clear rules 
for 
financial 
management 
and guidelines 
for 
control 
of 
finances; 
many 
of 
these 
rules 
have 
recently 
been 
updated, 
under 
USRP 
financing 
. 
Financial 
Monitoring 
Reports 
(FMR) 
will 
cover 
project 
accounting, 
procurement, contract 
management, 
physical 
progress 
and 
projected 
cash 
flow. 
The Special 
Account 
will 
be 
replenished 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
full 
documentation 
for 
contracts 
of 
amounts 
above US$500,000 
equivalent 
for 
works, 
US$300,000 
for 
goods, 
US$lOO,OOO 
for 
consulting 
firms 
and 
US$50,000 
for individual 
consultants, 
and 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
SOE 
below 
these 
thresholds.

5.1 
Steps 
undertaken 
for 
the preparation 
of 
the environmental 
assessment 
and 
mitigation 
plan: 
The 
advanced 
stage 
of 
disrepair 
of 
water 
supply 
and 
waste 
water 
facilities 
causes 
extensive 
pollution 
and 
health 
hazards. 
The 
project 
overall 
objective 
is 
not only to 
improve 
the 
provision 
of 
water, 
but 
also 
to improve 
environment and 
health 
conditions. 
The 
project 
enjoys 
a 
strong 
public 
support; 
the 
best 
environmental 
action 
that can 
be 
taken 
for 
the 
city 
is 
to 
implement 
it 
rapidly. 
An 
Environmental 
Assessment 
(EA) 
completed 
in 
1995, 
covered 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
water 
supply 
facilities 
and contained an 
Environment 
Management 
Plan 
(EMP). 
The 
EA 
was 
updated 
in 
March 
2000 
to 
include 
the 
waste 
water 
collection 
and 
disposal 
component 
of 
the project. 
Following initial 
review 
an 
addendum was 
issued 
in 
October 2002 
to 
reflect 
comments 
by 
co-financiers, 
the 
National 
Environmental 
Management 
Council 
(NEMC) 
and the 
Vice 
President’s 
Office. 
The 
addendum includes 
a 
summary 
of 
the 
EA 
report, the 
EMP 
and 
Public 
Consultation. 
The 
EAIEMP 
were disclosed 
publicly 
in 
Tanzania 
on 
February 28,2003. 
5.2 
Main 
features 
and 
adequacy 
of 
the 
EMP: 
Bulk 
water supply. 
Regulation 
of 
the 
Ruvu 
river, 
Dar 
es 
Salaam 
main 
source 
of 
water, 
is 
being 
considered 
for 
the 
long 
term 
to 
support 
low 
flows 
during 
the 
dry 
season. 
The 
project 
includes an 
environmental 
assessment 
of 
the 
potential 
impact 
of 
such 
regulation 
works, 
as 
part 
of 
a 
regional 
EA 
of 
the 
Ruvu river 
watershed 
and 
of 
the 
Dares 
Salaam 
water 
distribution 
area 
and 
coastal 
offshore 
area. 
Three 
main 
alternatives 
are 
currently 
being 
considered: 
bunded 
reservoirs located 
close 
to 
the 
treatment 
plants, 
the 
Kidunda 
dam and the 
Ngerengere 
and 
Mgeta 
dams; 
another 
alternative 
considers a 
transfer 
from 
the 
Rufiji 
basin.

Constructions. 
Water Supply: 
The project 
will 
include 
works 
to 
dispose sludge 
of 
the 
Ruvu 
water 
treatment 
plants 
in 
an 
environmentally 
safe 
way 
and 
to 
secure 
proper 
drainage at 
all 
public 
water 
distribution 
outlets. 
Waste 
Water: 
The project 
will 
rehabilitate 
and 
upgrade 
sewers 
and 
stabilization 
ponds 
as 
well 
as 
the ocean 
outfall, 
adding 
100 
meters 
to 
its 
present 
length. 
The 
project 
will 
also 
include 
works 
for 
safe 
disposal 
of 
sludge 
from 
the stabilization 
ponds. 
The 
project 
will 
finally monitor 
the rehabilitated 
waste 
water 
systems 
to 
avoid 
renewed 
deterioration. 
The 
project 
will 
not 
rehabilitate the 
existing 
solid 
waste 
landfill 
site; 
the 
City 
Council 
plans 
to 
commission 
a 
new 
site that 
meets 
the 
public 
health and environmental 
standards 
with 
bilateral 
assistance. 
Construction 
(Others): 
During 
construction, safety equipment 
will 
be 
provided, and people 
safeguarded 
near 
work 
sites 
to 
avoid 
accidents 
and temporary 
pollution 
damages.

Stakeholders consultation: 
NEMC 
and 
various 
groups 
concemed 
with 
environmental 
issues 
have been 
5.5 
full 
time 
environmental 
specialist 
to 
supervise 
the 
environmental performance 
of 
DAWASA 
and 
the 
Operator. 
The 
environmental 
supervisor 
will 
monitor 
the 
implementation and 
functioning 
of 
the 
rehabilitated 
systems, 
and 
will 
maintain 
a 
regular 
reporting 
system 
and 
a data 
base. 
Environmental 
independent 
audits 
will 
be 
carried 
with 
the 
assistance 
of, 
for 
example, 
the 
Institute 
for 
Resource Assessment 
of 
the 
University 
of 
Dar 
es 
Salaam. 
Monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
of 
the 
impact 
of 
theproject 
on 
the

DAWASA 
will 
employ 
a 
6. 
Social: 
6.1 
Key 
social 
issues 
relevant 
to 
the project 
objectives: 
Redeployment 
of 
existing 
DAWASA 
stag: 
The 
1,500 
existing 
DAWASA 
employees 
will 
be 
employed 
by 
either the 
new 
AHA 
or 
the 
Operator. 
The 
selected 
IPP 
has 
indicated 
that 
the Operator, 
it 
will 
become 
the 
majority 
shareholder 
of, 
will 
not 
retrench 
any 
staff; 
some 
of 
the 
staff 
will 
however 
be 
reassigned 
to 
sub- 
contractors 
employed 
for 
construction activities. 
Consultation 
with 
representatives 
of 
DAWASA 
staff took 
place 
prior 
to 
appraisal; 
DAWASA 
and 
the Operator 
have 
now 
agreed 
on 
reassignment procedures. 
Resettlement 
of 
families illegally 
settled 
on 
the 
transmission lines: 
Over 
the 
years, 
DAWASA 
did 
not 
prevent 
illegal 
construction 
in 
the 
rights 
of 
way 
of 
its 
two 
transmission 
lines, 
in 
particular 
in 
the 
downstream 
part 
of 
the 
Upper 
Ruw 
line. 
Illegal 
constructions also 
exist 
very 
close 
to 
the 
stabilization 
ponds. 
While 
this 
has 
not 
created a 
major 
problem 
so 
far, 
the Operator 
may 
request 
DAWASA 
to 
ensure 
that 
access 
to key 
equipment 
of 
the 
pipes 
(wash-out, 
air 
valves) 
is 
guaranteed 
to 
perform 
routine 
maintenance 
tasks. 
Resettlement 
is 
expected 
mostly 
from 
improved 
operations 
rather than 
from 
construction activities 
and 
therefore 
will 
be 
limited. 
The 
Resettlement 
Framework 
Paper 
(RFP) 
prepared 
by 
DAWASA 
was 
found 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank 
and 
publicly 
disclosed 
in 
Tanzania 
on 
February 28,2003. 
The 
RFP 
provides 
for 
an 
annual 
assessment 
of 
the 
construction 
program, 
the 
identification 
of 
affected 
families, 
the preparation 
of 
a 
Resettlement 
Action 
Plan 
and the 
payment 
of 
compensation, 
if 
needed, 
before construction 
is 
initiated. 
Communication 
to 
affected families 
will 
be 
made 
in 
a 
language 
they 
understand 
and 
a 
medium 
they 
have 
access 
to. 
Disconnection 
of 
illegal 
users 
along the 
transmission lines: 
Offtakes 
along 
the 
transmission lines 
contributes 
to 
the 
reducing 
the quantity 
of 
water 
available at 
Dar 
es 
Salaam 
main 
reservoirs. 
Leaks 
and 
offtakes possibly 
account 
for 
up 
to 
40% 
of 
the 
production 
at 
the 
treatment plants; 
DAWASA 
is 
already 
rationalizing 
connections 
on 
transmission 
lines 
under 
USRP. 
The 
Operator 
is 
likely to 
disconnect customers 
Page  21
17 
using 
drinking 
water 
for 
irrigation 
purposes. 
DAWASA will 
offer 
them 
an 
alternative 
by 
helping them 
to 
develop 
their 
own 
water 
supply 
system 
under 
the 
Community 
WSS component. 
Affordability 
of 
the WSSservice 
by 
low 
income 
households: 
The 
project 
will 
support connection 
of 
low 
income 
domestic 
customers 
to 
piped 
water, 
if 
a 
distribution 
pipe 
exists nearby. 
Beneficiaries 
will 
be 
required 
to 
deposit 
Tshs20,OOO 
(US$21) 
and 
will 
receive 
a 
connection 
valued 
at 
an 
average 
Tshs145,OOO 
(US$lSO) 
financed 
by 
the Connection 
Fund. 
Also 
all 
domestic 
customers 
will 
benefit 
from 
a 
reduced 
Customer 
Tariff 
of 
Tshs322/m3 (equivalent 
to 
the 
Operator 
Tariff) 
for 
the 
first 
5m3 consumed 
each 
month 
(5m3/month 
is 
usually 
accepted 
as 
the 
lifeline 
consumption 
in 
African 
cities). 
Finally 
the 
Community 
WSS 
component, 
to 
be 
implemented 
with 
assistance 
from 
specialized 
NGOs, 
will 
provide 
grants 
to 
communities 
that cannot be 
served 
by 
piped 
water 
to 
develop 
their 
own 
supplies. 
Other 
affected 
groups: 
Providers 
of 
substitutes 
to piped 
water, such 
as 
small 
water 
vendors 
or larger 
tankers 
will 
see 
their 
business 
reduced 
as 
a 
result 
of 
an 
improved 
public 
WSS; 
they 
will 
only 
gradually 
be 
affected 
since 
improvement 
will 
not 
happen overnight. 
Illegal 
users 
of 
the 
WSS 
service 
(illegal 
offtakers 
on 
the 
transmission lines 
or on 
the 
distribution network 
or 
bad 
payers) 
or illegal 
providers 
of 
service 
(artisans 
building 
illegal 
connections) 
will 
also 
be 
affected 
by 
the 
project 
whose 
main 
objective 
is 
to 
institute 
rational 
operation and discipline. 
e 
6.2 
stakeholders 
affected 
by 
the project. 
Minutes 
of 
meetings 
with 
the 
following 
groups 
highlight 
project 
features 
that 
take 
their 
valid 
concerns 
into 
account: 
(a) 
DAWASA 
staff; 
(b) 
households 
that 
could potentially 
be 
resettled 
along 
the transmission 
lines 
and 
near 
the 
stabilization 
ponds; 
(c) 
environmental 
groups; 
(d) 
water 
tankers 
and 
water 
vendors; 
(e) 
commercial 
customers; 
(f) 
institutional 
customers; 
(g) 
representatives 
of 
domestic 
customers; 
(h) 
current 
customers 
along 
the 
transmission 
lines; 
(i) 
NGOs; 
and 
(j) 
the 
media. 
The 
main 
challenge 
is 
now to 
carefully 
manage 
expectations 
that 
may 
be 
high 
after 
a 
very 
long 
preparation period; 
obviously the 
quality 
of 
the WSS 
service 
cannot 
improve 
overnight 
with 
the 
mobilization 
of 
the 
Operator. 
During 
project 
implementation, 
EWURA 
will 
channel customer 
concerns 
to 
DAWASA 
and 
the Operator 
and 
make 
public information 
on 
tariff 
adjustment. 
Participatory 
approach: 
During 
project 
preparation, 
GOT 
and 
DAWASA 
have consulted 
with 
key 
6.3 
inputs 
to 
the 
design 
of 
aspects 
of 
the 
project 
during 
the 
stakeholder 
assessment. 
NGOs 
have been 
associated 
with 
the design 
of 
the 
Community 
WSS 
component 
of 
the 
project 
and 
will 
be employed 
by 
DAWASA 
to 
implement 
it. 
NGOs 
will 
also 
be 
consulted 
by 
EWURA during 
informal 
or 
structured surveys 
to 
be 
carried out 
in 
low 
income 
communities 
on 
evolution 
of 
the 
quality 
of 
service 
and WSS 
budget 
of 
households. 
Consultations 
and collaboration with 
NGOs: 
NGOs 
have been 
consulted 
on 
the 
EA 
and 
have 
offered 
6.4 
incentives 
to 
ensure 
that 
all 
actors 
(GOT, 
DAWASA, 
Operator) focus 
on 
improvement 
of 
the 
reliability 
of 
the 
WSS 
service 
to 
existing 
customers 
and extension 
of 
service 
to 
un-served 
communities, rather 
than 
purely 
on 
construction 
activities.  The 
transfer 
of 
the 
commercial 
risk 
to 
the Operator 
implicitly 
encourages 
the latter 
to 
expand 
the 
customer 
base 
and 
increase 
sales; 
the transfer 
of 
responsibility 
for implementing 
the 
rehabilitatiodextension 
of 
the 
distribution network 
and 
for 
managing the Connection 
Fund 
will 
provide 
to 
the 
Operator 
the 
means 
to 
achieve 
increased coverage. 
The 
metering 
program 
will 
gradually improve 
the 
affordability 
of 
the WSS 
service 
by 
charging 
customers 
for 
what 
they 
actually 
consume, 
rather 
than 
overestimated 
consumption. 
The 
Community 
WSS 
component 
will 
improve 
the 
lot 
of 
communities 
that 
cannot 
benefit 
from 
extension 
of 
piped 
water 
immediately. 
Reports 
to 
be 
periodically 
issued 
by 
the Operator 
will 
include 
data 
on

The 
key 
elements 
that

affect the sustainability 
of

The 
clarity

Fixing 
the

itself

3.2 
Billing 
on 
assessed 
consumption: 
Billing 
by 
the Operator 
will 
initially 
be 
based 
on 
currently 
assessed 
consumption, 
which 
are 
assumed 
to 
be 
higher 
than actual 
consumption, 
and 
used 
for 
its 
current 
billing 
until 
meters 
are 
installed. 
While 
currently 
customers 
do not 
argue 
with DAWASA, 
a 
public 
entity, 
on 
the 
basis 
for 
billing 
or 
they 
simply do 
not 
pay 
their 
bills, 
they 
may 
complain 
that the private Operator 
overcharges 
them 
and refuse 
to 
pay 
until 
the dispute 
is 
settled. 
The project includes 
an 
ambitious metering program: 
under 
the 
Lease Contract, 
all 
GOT 
agencies 
connections 
will 
be 
metered 
within 
the 
first 
twelve 
months 
and 
all 
other connections 
will 
be 
metered 
within 
the 
first 
five 
years. 
Conditions 
for 
contesting 
meter 
readings 
are 
clearly specified 
in 
the 
Lease 
and 
Customer 
Contracts. 
DAWASA 
and 
EWURA 
will 
closely 
monitor 
implementation 
of 
the 
metering program 
by 
the

Tshs87.0 
billion 
(US$SS.O 
million) and an 
IXR 
of 
24%. 
The 
most 
significant 
drivers 
of 
the 
NPV 
and 
IRR 
are 
the 
direct 
expenditure 
savings 
by 
existing 
domestic 
customers, 
existing 
standpost consumers, 
new private 
domestic customers 
and 
new 
standpost consumers; 
the 
total 
estimated 
annual 
savings 
amount 
to 
Tshs5.O 
billion 
(US$5.0 
million), 
due 
to 
the 
much lower 
financial 
tariff 
that 
will 
have 
to 
be paid 
by 
customers 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
project. 
However, 
these 
ENPV 
and 
EIRR 
estimates 
are 
conservative 
because 
they do 
not 
include 
the 
economic 
benefits expected 
from 
sewerage 
investments 
(estimated 
to 
cost 
US$22.0 
million) 
and that 
going to 
commercial 
and industrial 
customers 
(currently over 
3,000 
and 
expected 
to 
grow 
to 
about 
5,400 
by 
20 
13). 
Also 
the 
calculations 
for 
the expenditure saving 
assume 
an 
average 
price 
of 
Tshs 
10 
for 
a 
20 
liter jerrican 
(equivalent 
to 
Tshs500/m3) 
instead 
of 
the commonly 
observed 
Tshs2O 
to 
50 
(Tshs1,OOO 
to 
2,500 
per 
m3). 
Finally, 
the 
calculations 
do 
not 
account 
for 
the 
fact 
that 
many 
of 
the 
existing 
DAWASA 
domestic customers 
are 
buying 
water 
from 
vendors 
to 
supplement the 
inadequate 
supply 
from 
DAWASA. 
NPV 
and 
IRR 
calculations: 
The 
analysis 
indicates 
that the 
project 
has 
apositive 
economic 
NPV 
of 
1.3. 
The 
financial 
analysis 
arrives 
at a 
NPV 
of 
Tshs60.0 
billion 
(US$62.0 
million) 
with 
a 
IRR 
of 
20%. 
Its 
sensitivity 
analysis indicates that 
both 
are 
robust. 
The economic returns 
of 
the 
project 
exceed 
the 
financial 
returns 
because 
of: 
(i) 
large 
expenditure 
savings 
arising 
from 
the 
difference between 
the 
financial 
tariff 
to 
be 
charged 
by 
the 
project 
(at 
an 
average Tshs455/m3) 
and 
the 
average 
price 
that 
standpost consumers 
and 
unconnected households 
are 
paying when 
buying 
water 
from 
neighbors, vendors and tankers 
(conservatively 
estimated 
at 
TshslO 
per 
20 
literjerrican) 
and 
the 
significant over 
billing 
of 
domestic customers 
by 
DAWASA. 
With 
the project, the 
new 
paying 
consumers 
will 
receive 
a 
large 
consumer 
surplus. 
The 
project 
will 
also 
be 
able 
to 
supply 
water 
much 
more efficiently 
and 
at a 
lower 
price 
than current 
substitute 
sources; 
the 
average 
unit 
price 
of 
water 
procured 
from 
all 
sources 
combined 
will 
fall.  The 
resources 
released 
by 
this 
cutback 
are 
a 
benefit 
to 
the 
overall 
economy. 
The 
project 
is 
expected 
to 
result 
into 
significant 
savings 
as 
households 
shift 
to 
direct 
purchase 
from 
DAWASA, 
and 
to 
significantly 
reduce 
time 
spent 
and 
as 
well 
as 
distances 
traveled 
to 
safe 
water 
sources. 
1.4. 
households 
is 
based 
on 
the: 
(i) 
intensification 
of 
the 
distribution 
network 
in 
low 
income 
neighborhoods; 
(ii) 
introduction 
of 
a 
Connection 
Fund 
to 
finance 
small 
diameter domestic connections; 
and 
(iii) 
adoption 
of 
a 
“lifeline” 
domestic 
tariff 
for 
the 
first 
5 
m3 
consumed each 
month, that 
will 
also applies 
standposts. 
In 
addition 
a 
Community 
WSS 
component 
will 
provide 
improved 
WSS services 
to 
about 
50 
low 
income 
communities that 
cannot 
rapidly 
be 
reached 
by 
piped 
network. 
Assuming 
a 
per 
capita consumption 
of 
151cd 
in 
low 
income 
households, 
prices 
of 
TshslO 
to 
20 
per 
20 
literjerrican 
(Tshs5OO 
to 
1,OOO/m3) 
and 
an 
average 
household 
size 
of 
4.3, 
low 
income 
households 
are 
currently 
spending 
at least 
Tshs980 
to 
1,960 
per 
month 
on 
water; 
many 
spend 
more 
than 
this 
as 
water 
is 
often 
sold 
at rates 
of 
up 
to 
Tshs5O 
per 
20 
liter 
jerrican. 
Such 
levels 
of 
expenditure

Tanzania 
of 
Tshs48,OOO. 
With 
the 
new 
tariff 
of 
Tshs322/m3 
applying 
for 
the 
first 
5 
m3 
consumed 
each 
month, 
low 
income 
households 
connected 
to 
the 
piped 
system 
and 
still 
consuming 
151cd 
will 
see 
their 
water budget 
reduced 
to 
about 
Tshs650imonth 
(1.3% 
of 
their 
income); 
if 
they 
are 
taking 
full 
advantage 
of 
the 
lower 
tariff 
and consuming 
5 
m3/month 
(Le., 
by 
more 
than 
doubling 
their 
consumption 
to 
38 
lcd) they 
will 
spend 
Tshsl,610/ 
month 
(or 
3.4% 
of 
their 
income). 
Households 
relying 
on 
public 
standposts 
will 
have 
to 
pay 
more, 
as 
user 
fees 
will 
have 
to 
cover 
the cost 
of 
the 
standpost caretaker 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
DAWASA 
tariff; 
a 
standpost 
consuming 
180 
m3/month 
will 
result 
in 
a 
water 
bill 
of 
about 
Tshs57,500/month; 
if 
the revenue 
of 
the 
caretaker 
is 
about 
Tshs72,500 
the 
average 
tariff 
charged 
to 
users 
will 
be 
about Tshs725/m3 
(Tshs 
15 
per 
20 
liter 
jerrican) resulting 
in 
a 
monthly 
water 
budget 
of 
Tsh1,425. 
Provided 
that 
a 
distribution 
pipe 
exists 
nearby, 
a 
low 
income household 
will 
have 
an 
interest 
in 
requesting 
an 
individual 
connection 
(valued 
at 
an 
average 
Tshs145,OOO) 
to 
be 
financed 
by 
the 
Connection 
Fund 
and 
by 
paying 
an 
advance 
of 
Tshs20,OOO 
on 
its 
future 
consumption. 
1.5. 
production 
of 
slightly 
below 
300,00Om3/day 
is 
likely 
to 
be 
sufficient 
to 
supply 
a 
population 
of 
about 3.0 
million 
people, 
which 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
reached 
by 
2007 
in 
the Service 
Area, 
provided, however, 
that 
both 
consumption 
and 
management 
of 
the 
service 
are 
efficient. 
Thus 
the 
project 
aims 
at 
rehabilitating 
the 
existing 
WSS 
facilities 
and 
its 
technical and commercial 
operations 
and 
at 
implementing 
a 
pricing policy 
encouraging 
customers 
to 
adjust 
their 
consumption, 
rather 
than 
immediately 
increasing 
production 
capacity, 
as 
initially 
envisaged 
by 
GOT. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
the project 
aims at 
reaching 
new 
customers 
by 
extending 
distribution networks 
and 
favoring 
connections 
to 
the 
systems 
of 
low 
income 
households.

Contribution 
to 
the 
MDG: 
To 
meet 
the 
MDG, 
improvements 
in 
WSS 
should 
result 
in 
halving 
the 
percentage 
of 
the 
population 
without 
access 
to 
improved 
WSS 
by 
2015. 
The 
Service 
Area 
(including Bagamoyo 
and Kibaha) 
has 
an 
official 
2002 
population 
2,680,000. 
It 
is 
estimated 
that the 
DAWASA 
system 
currently 
provides 
water 
to 
about 
2,100,000 
people 
(78%); 
the 
service 
is 
highly 
unreliable. 
The 
Poverty Reduction 
Strategy, 
2000 
observes 
that 
68% 
of 
the 
urban 
population 
has 
access 
to 
some 
kind 
of 
piped 
water 
but 
that 
less 
than 
half 
of 
the 
served 
population 
obtains 
a 
24 hour 
supply; 
un-served 
households 
are 
depending 
on 
expensive 
substitutes. 
It 
appears 
realistic, 
therefore, 
to 
assume 
that 
only 
about 35% 
of 
the 
current 
population 
has a 
24 hour 
service. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
the 
project 
(2008), 
an 
estimated 
2,950,000 
people 
(93%) 
out 
of 
3,160,000 
will 
be 
receiving 
a 
service 
from 
DAWASA. 
Of 
this, 
an estimated 70% 
is 
expected 
to 
receive 
a 
24 
hour 
service 
with 
minimum 
pressure. 
This 
constitutes 
an 
important 
step 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
MDG, 
that 
will 
have 
to 
be 
sustained 
by 
implementing 
a 
medium term 
investment 
program 
for 
increasing water 
production 
and 
waste 
water 
collection 
and 
treatment 
capacities.

of 
the 
technical and 
financial 
indicators 
during 
the 
coming 
10 year 
period 
(2004 
- 
2013). 
Realistically, 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
the project, 
it 
is 
safe 
to 
assume 
that 
the 
quality 
of 
service 
will 
deteriorate 
significantly 
due 
to 
increasing 
UfW, 
decreased 
treatment capacity, 
and 
lack 
of 
maintenance. 
The “without” 
project 
scenario 
is 
based 
on 
a 
continuation 
of 
the 
present 
level 
of 
service

Due 
to 
the 
impact 
of 
the deteriorating WSS 
infrastructure, 
the 
HBS 
shows 
that overall, 
there 
has 
been 
a 
decline 
in 
the number 
of 
households 
using 
any 
type 
of 
piped 
water 
supply 
in 
the Service 
Area, 
and 
a 
doubling 
of 
the 
proportion 
of 
households 
using 
point 
sources 
(protected 
and 
unprotected)  such 
as 
springs and 
wells. 
The 
number 
of 
households 
relying on 
in-house 
connections 
is 
a 
mere 
14% 
(down 
from 
22% 
in 
1991/92) 
while 
those 
relying 
on 
connections outside the 
house 
is 
19% 
(down 
from 
53%); 
some 
46% 
of 
the 
households 
now 
depend 
on 
a 
neighbor’s 
connection 
for 
water. 
Piped 
water 
to 
community 
outlets 
had 
declined 
from 
18% 
to 
7% 
over 
the 
10 
year 
period. 
Further, service 
to 
connected households 
is 
available 
a 
few 
days 
a 
week and 
only 
for 
a 
few 
hours 
in 
the 
days 
when 
supply 
is 
available 
-the 
supply 
is 
highly 
irregular 
and 
many 
households 
report being without 
piped 
water 
for 
three 
days at 
a 
time. 
As 
a 
result, connected 
households are 
depending 
on 
multiple 
alternative 
sources 
of 
water 
and 
take precautions 
by 
increasing 
storage; 
black 
plastic 
tanks 
on 
the 
ground or 
mounted 
on 
houses are 
a 
common 
site 
in 
Dar 
es 
Salaam. 
2.3. 
The information provided 
by 
the 
HBS 
confirms 
the 
state 
of 
DAWASA 
as 
a 
rapidly 
declining 
utility; 
this 
finding 
is 
consistent 
with 
other 
technical 
studies. 
However, 
the 
technical 
estimates 
of 
the 
population directly 
served 
with 
piped 
water (based 
on 
DAWASA 
records 
and 
technical 
estimates) 
differ 
from 
those 
given 
by 
the 
HBS. 
Technical 
estimates 
indicate that 
the 
current 
population 
with 
access 
to 
improved 
WSS 
is 
about 
2.10 
million 
(about 
1 
.OO 
million 
through direct 
connections; 
about 
1 
.OO 
million 
through 
standposts, 
and 
about 
100,000 
by 
community 
water 
supplies).  These 
technical 
estimates, therefore, 
imply 
a 
78% 
coverage 
as 
opposed 
to 
the 
HBS 
estimate 
of 
85.7%. 
Further, 
other 
studies 
carried out 
in 
Dar 
es 
Salaam 
(Small 
Scale 
Independent 
Providers 
of 
Water 
and 
Sanitation 
to 
the 
Urban 
Poor 
in 
Dar-es-Salaam) 
indicate 
that there 
is 
significant 
water 
vending 
by 
handcart 
and 
tanker 
operators 
currently 
serving 
an 
estimated 
92,000 
people 
-this 
is 
not 
reflected 
in 
the 
HBS. 
Assuming: 
(a) 
a 
2002 
population 
of 
2,680,000; 
(b) 
direct 
access 
to 
2,100,000 
people; 
(c) 
vendor 
service 
to 
100,000 
people; 
and; 
(d) 
165,000 
people 
depending 
on 
unprotected and 
other 
sources, 
the 
estimated 
population 
obtaining water 
from 
a 
neighbor’s 
connection 
would be 
about 
320,000. 
This 
amount 
is 
significantly lower 
than 
the estimate 
given 
in 
the 
HBS 
which 
suggests 
that 
930,000 
people 
are 
currently depending 
on 
a 
neighbor’s 
connection. 
The 
economic analysis 
uses 
320,000 
as 
the 
estimated 
number 
of 
people depending 
on 
a 
neighbor’s 
connection 
for 
water.

possible 
by 
reducing 
UFW. 
It 
is, 
therefore, 
crucial 
that 
the 
works 
are 
delivered 
in 
a 
timely 
manner 
so 
that the 
set 
UFW 
targets 
are 
realized 
as 
planned. 
To 
assess 
the 
impact 
of 
slower 
delivery 
of 
performance, 
two 
changes 
to 
base 
case 
were 
modeled: 
The 
economic benefits 
are 
mainly 
predicated 
on 
the 
incremental consumption 
by 
new 
customers, 
made 
If 
improvement 
in 
transmission 
and 
distribution 
losses 
is 
five 
points lower than 
the 
base 
case 
every 
year, 
i.e. 
evolving 
from 
63% 
now 
to 
28% 
in 
2013 
instead 
of 
from 
58% 
to 
25%; 
the 
EIRR 
dropping 
from 
24% 
to 
19%; and 
A 
ENPV 
equal 
to 
zero 
would 
result 
from 
improvement 
in 
transmission 
and 
distribution 
losses 
lower 
by 
15 
points 
than 
the 
base 
case, 
Le., 
evolving 
from 
73% 
now to 
38% 
in 
2013 
instead 
of 
from 
58% 
to 
33%. 
When 
tested 
against 
the 
financial NPV, 
a 
reduction 
of 
improvement 
by 
about 
10 
points 
each 
year 
would lower 
the financial 
NPV 
to 
0. 
Both 
indicate 
that 
the 
financial 
and 
economic 
returns 
of 
the 
project 
are 
quite 
robust, a 
conclusion that 
is 
supported 
by 
later 
years’ 
projected 
gains. 
The 
fact 
that 
the 
economic 
rate 
of 
return 
is 
higher 
than 
the 
financial 
rate 
of 
return 
implies 
that 
sustainability 
of 
the 
project 
can 
be achieved.

In

the 
analysis 
assumes 
that

continue

all

to 
the project-related

The 
implications 
of 
this 
in 
terms 
of 
required 
conditions 
(amounts 
of 
borrowings, 
sustainable 
borrowing 
interest 
rates 
and

etc.) 
were 
taken 
into

in 
the

of 
the project. 
The 
financial 
projections 
of 
the 
bid 
by 
the

were also 
analyzed 
for 
sustainability 
and 
consistency. 
An

financial 
risk 
factors. 
This 
Annex 
is 
divided 
into 
five 
sections. 
Section 
I1 
discusses 
the 
financial 
forecasts 
of 
DAWASA 
and 
the 
Operator 
and 
discusses 
the 
critical 
factors 
affecting 
sustainability. 
Section 
111 
discusses 
the 
investment 
and 
sensitivity 
analysis 
for project 
financial 
returns. 
Section 
IV 
discusses 
the 
fiscal 
impact 
of 
the 
project 
on 
GOT. 
Section 
V 
summarizes 
the 
base 
case 
financial 
projection 
assumptions. 
The financial 
model 
will 
be 
archived 
in 
project 
files. 
The 
financial viability 
of 
DAWASA 
and the 
Operator 
was analyzed, focused 
on 
their ability to 
service 
the 
1.2. 
The uncertainty 
of 
the 
accuracy 
of 
some 
data 
used 
is 
a 
risk. 
The lack 
of 
production 
and 
consumer meters 
throws 
the 
technical 
assumptions 
(e.g. 
production 
volumes,  systems 
losses, 
etc.) 
into 
some 
doubt.  Inconsistencies 
also appear 
between 
available 
technical 
and 
commercial 
data.  Nevertheless, 
the 
available 
data 
have been estimated 
through various 
studies 
and revised 
to 
take 
into 
account the 
results 
of 
various 
due 
diligence 
performed 
in 
the 
run-up 
to 
the 
project. 
These include, 
among 
others: 
. 
. 
The 
Howard 
Humphreys Feasibility 
Report 
for 
the 
Dar 
es 
Salaam 
Water Supply 
System 
(1995); 
The 
studies, due 
diligence and re-examination 
of 
the 
Feasibility 
Report carried out 
by 
DAWASA 
and 
PPSRC’s 
advisors 
for 
the 
privatization 
process 
(Sevem 
Trent 
Water 
International 
- 
STWI), 
including 
the 
revalidation 
of 
the 
Feasibility 
Report through 
site 
visits 
and 
inspections 
of 
the 
facilities 
between 
1998 and early 
1999; 
The 
due 
diligence 
performed 
by 
the 
pre-qualified 
companies 
during 
the 
first 
Lease 
bidding 
process 
(1 
999); 
A 
further 
due 
diligence 
by 
the 
winning 
Operator 
in 
the 
second Lease 
bidding 
process (2002); 
and 
The 
audit 
of 
DAWASA 
financial 
accounts. 
. 
. 
A 
sensitivity 
analysis 
was also 
carried out 
to 
mitigate 
the 
risk 
of 
data inaccuracies.

Lease, 
reflecting 
the 
likely 
impact 
of 
the 
project 
on 
the 
financial 
viability 
of 
DAWASA 
and 
the 
Operator, 
were 
prepared. 
The 
base 
case 
financial 
projections 
assumes 
only 
the 
investments 
identified 
under 
project 
- 
the 
immediate 
Capital Investment Program 
(CIP). 
This 
is 
the 
first 
of 
a three 
phase 
program 
recommended 
in 
the 1995 
Feasibility 
Report 
(see 
above).  These 
investments 
mainly 
involves 
asset 
rehabilitation, 
some 
extensions 
into 
new 
areas 
and 
a 
scheme 
for 
provision 
of 
supplies and 
services 
to 
low 
income 
groups. 
They 
are 
aimed at 
addressing 
the 
prolonged 
under-investment 
and 
inadequate 
maintenance 
under 
which 
the water 
and 
sanitation services 
in 
Dar 
es 
Salaam 
has 
been 
operating 
for 
some 
time. 
Detailed financial 
projections 
(in 
current 
terms 
of 
the 
Tanzanian 
Shillings) over the 
10-year 
period 
of 
the 
2.2. 
1999100 
Annual 
Accounts 
together 
with 
its 
2000101 
budget. 
Some 
financial 
and technical 
data 
were subsequently 
modified 
by 
the 
due 
diligence 
work 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
sole 
bidder 
(BiwaterlGauff)  and 
included 
in 
their proposal 
to 
the 
GOT. 
Other 
data were 
obtained 
from 
the 
STWI 
consultancy.  Base 
case 
assumptions 
are 
attached 
at 
the 
end 
of 
this 
Annex. 
The 
main 
sources 
for 
financial projections 
assumptions 
are 
the 
information 
gathered 
from 
DAWASA 
Financial 
forecasts 
2.3. 
The 
Operator’s 
financial projections were 
analyzed 
and determined 
to 
show 
a 
sustainable 
operation. 
The 
results 
of 
appraisal 
projections indicate 
that 
both 
DAWASA 
and the Operator 
will 
remain financially 
viable. 
DAWASA’s 
internal 
cash 
generating 
capacity 
is 
adequate 
to 
fund 
its 
portion 
of 
the 
project 
investments. 
Cashflow 
from operations 
will 
be 
negative 
or 
weak (especially 
in 
the 
first 
two 
years) 
in 
the 
initial 
three 
years. 
Total 
owner’s 
Page  45
41 
equity 
for both 
the Operator and 
DAWASA 
remains 
positive 
throughout. 
External 
funds 
committed 
to 
DAWASA 
and the Operator 
will 
form 
a 
buffer 
against 
initial 
liquidity 
difficulties, 
as 
will 
capitalization 
of 
interests 
of 
DAWASA’s 
borrowings 
in 
the 
first 
five 
years. 
Both 
DAWASA 
and the 
Operator 
remain 
able 
to 
build 
debt 
service 
reserves 
and service 
their 
loans 
obligations 
due 
from 
Year 
6. 
DAWASA’s 
profitability 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
weak 
but 
should stabilize 
by 
Year 
5, 
when 
the 
metering 
program 
is 
due 
for 
completion, 
achieving 
profitability 
towards 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Lease. 
This 
reflects 
a strategy 
to 
balance 
the need 
for 
cost 
recovery 
against 
avoiding 
the need 
for 
sudden 
tariff 
hikes. 
The grant 
element 
to 
be 
passed 
on 
to 
DAWASA 
as 
GOT 
equity 
represents a 
liquidity 
support 
to 
make 
possible 
gradual 
tariff 
revisions 
towards 
full 
cost 
recovery 
from 
customers 
by 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Lease 
period. 
Key 
factors 
affecting 
the 
financial 
sustainability 
of 
the 
project 
2.4. 
There 
are 
some 
provisions 
to 
buffer 
DAWASA 
and 
the Operator’s operations 
against 
delays 
in 
the 
speed 
of 
improvements and 
financial 
payments. 
However, 
critical 
factors 
needs 
to 
be 
monitored. 
The 
forecasts 
show that 
the 
initial 
two 
years 
of 
operations are 
most critical, especially 
for 
DAWASA. 
2.5. 
Section 
IV 
of 
this 
Annex) 
are 
provided 
on 
time. 
DAWASA 
will 
receive 
disbursements 
of 
loans 
and 
grants 
from 
GOT 
to 
finance 
project 
investment 
financing. 
Its 
cash 
position 
will 
be 
helped 
by 
the 
capitalization 
of 
interest 
during 
construction. 
Beyond 
this, 
DAWASA 
requires 
timely 
payment 
of 
the 
DAWASA 
portion 
of 
the 
Operator’s revenue 
collection. 
DAWASA’s 
initial 
cash 
generation capacity 
is 
very 
weak and 
cannot support 
more 
than 
its 
projected 
contribution 
to 
the project 
costs. 
In 
Year 
1, 
any 
delay 
at 
all 
of 
GOT 
disbursements 
for 
capital 
investment 
would 
immediately 
cause 
a 
corresponding delay 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
planned 
investment 
programs. 
Initial 
funding 
of 
DA 
WASA 
and 
the 
Operator. 
It 
is 
important 
that the 
all 
committed project 
funds 
(see 
2.6. 
for 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
treatment 
plants, 
pumping 
stations, 
transmission 
mains and 
water 
storage. 
Most 
of 
the 
works 
are 
due 
to 
be 
done 
by 
Year 
2. 
About 
US$58 
million 
are 
earmarked 
for 
rehabilitation 
and extension 
of 
primary, 
secondary 
and tertiary 
distribution 
over 
the 
first 
five  years 
of 
the 
Lease. 
Of 
this, 
about 
$42 
million 
are 
for 
secondary 
distribution, 
to 
be 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
Operator 
as 
delegated 
works. 
It 
is 
imperative 
that 
these 
works 
are 
carried 
out 
in 
time. 
The 
assumption 
of 
increased 
bill 
collection 
rates 
and 
growing 
customer 
base presupposes that 
capital works 
will 
save 
enough water 
from 
losses 
to 
adequately 
supply 
all 
customers 
present 
and new. 
Immediate 
CIP

of 
transmission 
and distribution 
losses. 
About 
US30 
million 
are 
earmarked 
2.7. 
Collection 
and 
billing 
eficiencies. 
The 
collection 
rate 
for 
revenue 
billed 
is 
currently 
estimated 
to 
be 
very 
low 
(48%) 
and 
provisions 
have been made 
to 
mitigate 
this 
situation 
such 
as 
providing 
DAWASA 
and the 
Operator 
with 
initial 
external 
cash 
injections. 
Collection 
is 
assumed 
to 
improve significantly 
- 
reaching 
90% 
by 
year 
5. 
The 
Operator 
is 
assumed 
to 
very 
rapidly 
implement 
a 
commercial 
system 
to 
ensure 
that 
all 
connected customers 
are 
billed 
from 
year 
1. 
Billing 
at standpipes are 
estimated 
to 
progress 
less 
rapidly 
- 
25% 
in 
year 
1,75% 
in 
year 2 
and 
full 
billing 
from 
year 
3. 
Assuming 
billing 
improvements 
are achieved, 
without 
the 
corresponding improvement 
in 
collections, 
the Operator 
liquidity 
will 
dry 
up 
by 
Year 
3. 
Conversely, 
if 
collection 
improvements 
are achieved, 
cashflow 
deficit 
will 
also 
occur 
due 
to 
a 
failure 
to 
bill 
more 
than 
65% 
of 
customers 
(excluding 
at 
standpipes) 
in 
Year 
1. 
2.8. 
time 
from 
the 
Operator. 
Since 
the 
Operator 
will 
be 
depositing 
the 
DAWASA 
portion 
of 
collected 
revenue 
on 
a 
weekly 
basis, 
this 
payment 
timing 
is 
not 
expected 
to 
be 
a 
significant 
risk. 
2.9, 
current amount 
billed 
appears 
to 
be 
much 
larger 
than the technical 
estimates 
of 
water 
available 
for 
distribution. 
A 
large 
degree 
of 
customer 
over 
billing 
is 
probable 
given 
the 
minimal 
metering 
and 
the 
use 
of 
an 
assessed 
consumption 
volumes 
for 
billing. 
It 
is 
currently 
not 
possible 
to 
gauge 
the 
real 
magnitude 
of 
the over 
billing; 
this 
represents a 
large 
uncertainty 
risk. 
It 
is 
expected 
that over 
billing 
will 
be 
eliminated 
as 
the metering program 
is 
implemented 
resulting 
in 
a 
lowering 
of 
the 
volumes 
billed 
per 
existing 
customers. 
The resulting 
lower 
household 
bills 
is 
offset 
by 
the projected 
increase 
in 
customers 
through new 
connections 
and 
the 
registration 
of 
illegal 
connections. 
This 
underscore 
again 
the importance 
of 
the immediate 
CIP 
being 
on 
schedule 
(see 
above). 
The 
payment 
to 
the 
Operator 
for 
new 
connections made 
would 
also 
encourage 
the achievement 
of 
growth 
targets. 
Payment

During 
the Lease 
period, 
nominal tariff 
will 
be 
revised yearly 
in 
accordance 
to 
an indexation 
formula 
taking 
into 
account 
inflation, 
etc. 
While 
delays 
are 
not 
expected, 
the 
timely 
revision 
of 
this 
nominal 
tariff 
in 
the 
early 
years 
is 
critical.

It 
is 
expected that customers 
would 
accept 
the proposed 
tariff 
levels, 
especially 
given 
the expected 
improvements 
in 
the 
network. 
Additionally, 
water 
vendors 
in 
the 
service 
area 
typically 
have 
a 
higher 
charge: 
approximately 
TshslOO

- 
equivalent 
to

(roughly

increase 
in

would 
be required 
to 
cover 
the

A. 
Procurement 
1. 
Ongoing 
procurement reform 
1.1. 
Public 
procurement 
is 
currently 
being reformed 
in 
Tanzania. 
In 
February 200 
1, 
GOT 
enacted 
the 
Procurement 
Law to 
replace 
all 
previous 
procurement 
legislation 
and 
issued 
two 
regulations 
for 
the Procurement 
of 
Goods 
and 
Works 
and 
the Selection 
and Employment 
of 
Consultants. 
In 
November 
2002, 
GOT 
issued 
a set 
of 
Standard 
Bidding 
Documents 
(SBD) 
for: 
(a) 
Procurement 
of 
Goods 
through 
International 
Competitive 
Bidding; 
(b) 
Procurement 
of 
Health 
Sector Goods; 
(c) 
Standard Request 
for 
Proposal; 
(d) 
Standard 
Pre-qualification Document 
for 
Procurement 
of 
Works; 
(e) 
Procurement 
of 
Works through 
National 
Competitive 
Bidding; 
and 
(f) 
Procurement 
of 
Works, Smaller 
Contracts. 
These documents were 
reviewed 
during 
the 
2003 
Country 
Procurement 
Assessment 
Report (CPAR) 
and 
found 
to 
be 
consistent 
with 
the 
Bank 
SBD. 
1.2. 
The 
Public 
Procurement 
Act 
(PPA)  covers 
procurement 
by 
both 
central 
government 
and 
local 
government 
agencies, 
though 
the 
latter 
is 
to 
be 
covered 
by 
specific 
Local 
Government Regulations 
to 
be 
issued 
under 
the 
Local 
Government Finance Act.  The authority 
in 
charge 
of 
local 
government 
has 
finalized draft 
Regulations and 
a 
Procurement 
Manual, 
which 
are 
in 
line 
with 
the 
new 
procurement 
law. 
A 
noticeable 
change 
in 
the 
new 
Regulations 
is 
the 
removal 
of 
councilors 
from 
local 
government 
tender boards. 
1.3. 
formulated: 
(a) 
establishing 
a 
Procurement 
Authority 
responsible 
for 
oversight 
of 
public 
procurement; 
(b) 
decentralizing procurement 
to 
ministries 
and 
departments; 
(c) 
changing 
the 
legal framework 
to 
include private 
sector 
representatives 
in 
the Public 
Procurement Appeals 
Authority; 
and 
(d) 
replacing the 
supplies 
officers 
with 
procurement 
specialists, 
a 
new position 
in 
the 
civil 
services 
rating 
system. 
The 
final 
report 
including 
all 
recommendations 
agreed 
upon 
during 
the 
stakeholders 
workshop 
will 
be 
submitted 
to 
the Government 
by 
end 
of 
March 
2003 
for 
implementation. 
During

Dear 
Ms. 
O’Connor, 
Letter 
of 
Urban 
Water 
Supply 
and 
Sewerage Sector 
Policy 
1. 
I 
am 
writing 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
Government 
of 
the 
United 
Republic 
of 
Tanzania 
to 
request 
a 
credit 
of 
US$61.50 
million 
from 
the 
International 
Development Association 
(IDA) 
in 
support 
of 
the US$164.60 
million 
proposed 
Dar 
es 
Salaam 
Water 
Supply 
and 
Sanitation 
Project 
(DWSSP). 
The 
project 
will 
be 
co-financed 
by 
the 
African 
Development 
Bank 
(ADB) 
and 
the European 
Investment 
Bank 
(EIB) 
to 
the tune 
of 
US$48.0 
million 
and 
US$34.0 
million 
respectively. 
The 
Government 
contribution 
to 
the 
project 
amounts 
to 
US$12.6 
million 
while 
the 
selected 
private 
professional 
operator 
- 
City 
Water 
Services 
Ltd 
equity 
stands 
at 
US$8.5 
million. 
The 
development 
objective 
of 
the 
project 
is 
to 
provide 
a 
reliable, 
affordable 
and 
sustainable 
water 
supply 
service 
and 
improve 
the 
sewerage 
and 
sanitation 
services 
in 
areas 
served 
by 
the 
Dar 
es 
Salaam 
Water 
and 
Sewerage 
Authority 
(DAWASA) 
that includes 
Dar 
es 
Salaam 
and 
part 
of 
the 
Coast 
region. 
This 
will 
help 
improve 
public 
health 
and 
well 
being 
in 
a 
city 
prone 
to 
cholera 
outbreaks 
or 
other water 
bome 
diseases 
and 
support 
productive activities 
of 
the 
country’s 
main 
economic 
centre. 
Background 
2. 
This 
letter 
of 
sector 
policy 
represents 
the 
essential elements 
of 
the 
urban 
water 
supply 
and 
sewerage 
component 
of 
the 
National 
Water 
Policy 
(NAWAPO, 
2002) 
that 
has 
been approved 
by 
the 
Government. 
The 
Government 
of 
Tanzania’s 
overriding 
policy 
goal 
is 
to 
reduce 
poverty 
in 
the country. 
This 
goal 
is 
outlined 
in 
the 
Poverty Reduction 
Strategy Paper 
(PSRP). 
One 
of 
the 
seven 
priority 
areas 
of 
the 
PRSP 
is 
the 
Water 
and 
Sanitation 
Sector, 
which 
is 
seen 
as 
key 
to 
effectively reducing 
poverty. 
NAWAPO 
is 
thus 
set 
within 
the 
overall 
policy 
framework 
of 
the 
PRSP 
and 
vision 
2025 
and 
represents 
an 
important 
comer 
stone 
for 
meeting 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals 
for 
the water 
sector 
which 
entails 
reducing 
by 
half 
the 
number 
of 
urban 
population without 
access 
to 
potable 
water 
supply 
and 
sanitation 
services 
by 
2015. 
3. 
The 
main 
objective 
of 
the 
urban 
water 
policy 
is 
to 
provide 
sustainable, 
reliable 
and 
affordable 
water 
supply 
and 
sewerage 
services 
to 
all 
water 
users 
in 
urban 
areas. 
The 
specific 
objectives 
of 
the 
policy 
includes creation 
of 
an 
enabling 
environment 
and 
appropriate 
incentives 
Page  72
for 
the 
delivery 
of 
services, 
development 
of 
an 
effective 
decentralized 
institutional 
framework 
that 
also 
ensures 
autonomy 
of 
water 
supply 
and 
sewerage 
entities 
and 
development 
of 
effective 
legal 
and 
regulatory 
framework 
for 
all 
sector 
players 
including 
the 
private 
sector. 
4. 
NAWAPO 
is 
an 
outcome 
of 
many 
a 
policy, institutional, legal 
and 
regulatory 
framework 
changes, 
which 
have 
taken 
place 
in 
the 
sector 
since 
the 
launching 
of 
the 
national 
water 
policy 
of 
199 
1. 
These 
changes 
are 
associated 
with 
liberalization 
of 
the 
economy, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
need 
for 
having improved 
services 
to 
the 
people. 
NAWAPO 
has 
been 
factored 
into 
the 
Medium 
Term 
Strategic 
Plan for 
improving 
urban 
water 
and 
sanitation 
services 
in 
the 
country. 
This 
Plan 
will 
soon 
be 
operationalized 
through the 
water 
sector 
development strategy 
and 
investment 
programme 
currently 
under 
preparation. 
5. 
Legislation 
and 
supporting regulations have 
been 
enacted 
at 
different 
times 
to 
regulate 
urban 
water 
supply 
and 
sewerage 
programs. 
Among 
them 
is 
Water 
Laws 
(Miscellaneous 
Amendments) 
Act 
No. 
8 
of 
1997, 
which 
amended 
the 
National 
Urban 
Water 
Supply 
Act 
No. 
7 
of 
1981 
to 
form 
Dar 
es 
Salaam 
Water 
Supply 
and 
Sewerage 
Authority (DAWASA). 
This 
was 
followed 
by 
the 
Water 
Laws 
(Miscellaneous 
Amendments) 
Act 
No. 
1 
of 
1999, 
which 
reformed 
DAWASA, 
the 
DAWASA 
Act 
of 
2001 
which 
made 
DAWASA 
comply 
with 
the regulatory 
requirements 
of 
the 
Energy 
and 
Water 
Utilities 
Regulatory 
Authority 
(EWURA) 
Act 
also 
enacted 
in 
2001. 
The 
EWURA 
Act 
has 
set 
the 
broad fiamework 
for 
regulating 
water 
and 
energy 
services 
in 
the country. 
Current 
Status 
of 
the 
Urban 
Water 
Supply 
and 
Sewerage 
6. 
The 
population 
of 
Tanzania 
is 
estimated 
at 
34.6 
million 
people, 
of 
which 
about 
8 
million 
live 
in 
urban 
centres. 
The 
urban 
water 
supply 
coverage 
is 
73%. 
The 
service 
delivery 
in 
18 
out 
of 
21 
urban 
centres 
has 
improved 
substantially 
since the establishment 
of 
the 
Urban 
Water 
and 
Sewerage 
Authorities 
(UWSA) 
in 
1998. 
Annual 
revenue 
collection 
(excluding 
DAWASA), 
for 
example, 
has 
more 
than 
doubled 
from 
Tshs 
4.5 
billion 
in 
1998 
to 
Tshs 
1 
1.7 
billion 
in 
June 2002. 
However, 
there 
are 
still 
some 
resource 
constraints, 
especially financial, 
for 
major 
rehabilitation 
and 
expansion 
of 
the 
infrastructure. 
7. 
Less 
than 
10% 
of 
the 
urban 
population 
is 
connected 
to 
a 
sewerage 
system 
and 
only 
10 
out 
of 
21 
regional 
urban 
centres 
are 
sewered, 
covering 
mainly 
the 
Central 
Business 
Districts. 
Recently, 
under 
the 
Urban 
Sector 
Rehabilitation 
Programme 
(USRP), 
the 
sewerage 
systems 
in 
five 
municipalities 
were 
rehabilitated 
and 
two 
new 
ones 
were 
constructed. 
As 
coverage 
is 
low, 
most 
people 
use 
septic  tanks 
and 
pit 
latrines.  Sludge disposal 
from 
these 
onsite  sanitation 
facilities 
is 
a 
problem 
particularly 
for 
those 
towns 
which 
have 
no 
sewage 
treatment 
plants. 
Soon 
there 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
studies 
on 
water 
supply 
and 
sanitation 
in 
these 
towns 
to 
address 
this 
issue. 
The 
contributing 
factors 
to 
the 
existing 
unsatisfactory 
situation 
in 
urban 
areas 
include: 
e 
Rapid population 
growth 
due 
to 
mal-urban 
migration. 
Statistics 
indicate that 
the 
urban 
population 
is 
increasing 
at 
an 
average 
rate 
of 
4.3% 
per 
annum 
which 
is 
much 
higher 
than 
the 
average 
national 
growth 
rate 
of 
2.9% 
a 
Inadequate 
financial

for 
investment.

8. 
The 
above constraints 
notwithstanding, 
the 
merging 
of 
water supply 
and 
sewerage 
under 
one 
institution 
is 
a 
move 
in 
the 
right 
direction 
intended 
to give 
sanitation 
more 
attention. 
Every 
urban 
water 
supply 
intervention 
now 
considers 
sewerage 
as 
well. 
Key 
Policy 
Issues 
in 
the Delivery 
of 
Urban Water 
Supply 
and 
Sewerage 
Services 
(UWSS) 
9. 
The 
overall 
policy 
objective.of 
the Government 
of 
Tanzania 
(GOT) 
is 
to 
improve 
public 
health, 
the environment 
and 
support economic 
activities 
in 
urban 
areas 
of 
Tanzania. 
The 
GOT 
will 
create 
the enabling 
environment 
and 
appropriate 
incentives 
for 
the 
delivery 
of 
reliable, 
sustainable 
and 
affordable 
water 
supply 
and 
sanitation 
services 
by 
shifting 
from 
the 
provision 
of 
UWSS 
services 
to 
the 
facilitation 
and 
financing 
of 
UWSS 
services. 
Water 
Sources 
and 
Infrastructure 
10. 
The 
Government 
recognizes that 
water 
sources are 
finite 
and 
should 
be 
managed 
both 
as 
a 
social 
and 
economic 
good. 
The 
Government 
Mher 
realizes that water 
sources 
for 
most 
urban 
water 
supplies are inadequate. 
The 
infrastructure 
for 
most 
urban 
water 
and 
sewerage systems are 
old,  inadequate 
and 
are 
not 
functioning 
to 
their 
capacity 
thus 
cannot  cope 
with 
increasing 
demand 
and 
emergencies. 
Further, 
the 
impact 
of 
human 
activities 
on 
the 
environment 
has 
increased 
the 
pollution risk 
on 
the water 
sources. 
The Government 
is 
taking 
measures 
to 
allow 
demarcation 
of 
the water 
sources 
to 
enable 
UWSA 
process 
and 
acquire 
title 
deeds 
of 
the 
land 
around the 
sources. 
Further, 
the Government 
will 
ensure 
that: 
Development 
of 
new 
water 
sources 
for 
urban 
water 
supply 
will 
consider 
environmental 
impact 
assessment 
and 
stakeholder 
consultation 
to 
design 
the 
mitigation 
plan. 
Necessary 
measures 
shall 
be 
taken 
to 
ensure 
that 
urban 
areas 
have 
adequate 
water 
supply 
and 
sanitation facilities. 
The 
sanitation 
facilities 
will 
vary 
from 
sewerage systems 
to 
hygienic 
onsite 
sanitation 
coupled 
with 
proper 
sludge 
disposal 
mechanism. 
Acquisition 
of 
necessary 
financing 
for 
rehabilitation 
and 
expansion 
of 
the 
systems 
will 
be 
undertaken. 
Development 
and 
expansion 
of 
the 
water 
supply 
systems 
shall 
consider 
both 
the 
development 
of 
sewerage 
systems 
and 
general 
environmental 
sanitation.

1. 
People 
living 
in 
under 
privileged 
urban

areas 
rarely benefit 
from 
adequate 
water

services. 
They 
cannot 
afford 
to 
have

13. 
The 
Government 
is 
aware 
of 
the 
need 
to 
protect 
the environment 
against 
all 
sorts 
of 
destruction, 
and 
pollution 
including 
that 
due 
to 
wastewater. Wastewater management 
shall 
go 
hand 
in 
hand 
with 
water supply 
development. 
All 
water 
supply 
schemes 
shall 
be 
evaluated 
against considerations 
of 
wastewater management 
and 
sewage 
treatment 
in 
the 
UWSA 
area 
of 
operation. 
These 
considerations 
as 
well 
as 
a 
development 
of 
a 
comprehensive 
environmental 
impact 
assessment 
will 
be 
an 
essential 
part 
of 
the 
regulatory 
arrangements.

the 
consent 
of

UWSAs 
will 
work 
with 
Local 
Governments 
to 
pass

Legal 
and 
Regulatory 
Framework 
15. 
water 
legislation 
in 
that: 
After 
the 
approval 
of 
NAWAPO, 
the Government 
has 
started the process 
of 
revisiting 
all 
0 
Existing 
laws related 
to 
water 
and 
sewerage 
in 
urban 
areas 
are reviewed, 
conflicting 
laws 
related 
to 
UWSS 
are 
identified 
and 
harmonized 
and 
different 
pieces 
of 
water 
and 
sewerage 
legislation 
are 
consolidated 
into 
one. 
An 
independent 
regulator 
(EWURA) 
is 
in 
the process 
of 
being 
set 
up 
and 
that 
sector 
specific 
legislation 
based 
on 
EWURA 
broad 
framework, 
to 
safeguard interests 
of 
the 
operator 
and 
the 
customer, 
is 
to 
be 
undertaken. 
The 
general 
public 
is 
empowered 
by 
law 
to 
institute 
cases 
of 
environment 
damage 
in 
courts 
of 
law. 
The 
law 
also 
allows 
complaints 
by 
general 
public 
to 
be 
raised 
against 
the suppliers 
of 
WSS 
services. 
Institutional 
Development, 
Decentralisation 
and 
Capacity 
Building 
16. 
The 
role 
of 
the Government 
has 
changed 
fiom 
that 
of 
a 
provider 
of 
services 
to 
that 
of 
a 
facilitator 
for 
service 
provision 
in 
the 
sector. 
In 
this 
endeavour, 
the 
Ministry 
responsible 
for 
water 
has undertaken 
major 
reforms 
in 
the 
urban 
sub-sector 
that 
have 
improved 
service 
delivery 
appreciably 
in 
the 
last eight 
years. 
Eighteen 
autonomous 
UWSAs 
have 
been 
established 
so 
far. 
The rationale 
is 
to 
have 
them 
operating 
sustainably 
and 
on 
sound 
commercial 
principles 
to 
attract 
private 
sector 
involvement 
in 
the 
medium 
term. 
The 
Government 
will 
ensure, 
through 
the 
Ministry 
responsible 
for 
water 
using 
expertise 
and 
experience 
gained 
in 
the 
reforms, 
that: 
An 
appropriate 
institutional 
framework 
to 
ensure 
establishment 
of 
decentralized 
autonomous 
entities 
for 
management 
of 
water supply 
and 
sewerage 
services 
in 
all 
urban 
centres 
is 
in 
place. 
To 
this 
end 
GOT 
will 
continue 
to 
promote 
and 
consolidate 
the concept 
of 
autonomous 
and 
decentralised 
Urban 
Water 
and 
Sewerage 
Authorities 
(UWSAs) 
in 
UWSS 
services 
areas. 
Such 
autonomous 
entities 
might 
not 
necessarily 
follow 
local 
government boundaries 
but 
should 
have govemance 
frameworks 
that 
ensure 
full 
participation 
of 
service 
area 
beneficiary 
Local 
Govemment(s) 
as 
well 
as 
guarantee 
broad 
representation 
of 
consumers 
on 
its 
governing 
Board. 
' 
The 
UWSAS 
will 
operate 
in 
a 
manner 
that promotes the 
maximum 
efficiency 
in 
the 
day 
to 
day 
operations 
through 
a 
regime 
of 
performance 
contracts 
between 
GOT 
and 
the respective 
UWSA 
as 
well 
as 
between 
the 
UWSA 
and 
its 
operating entities (public 
or 
private). 
On 
a 
case 
by 
case 
basis, 
UWSAs 
could 
seek 
permission 
from 
the 
Ministry 
in 
charge 
of 
water 
to 
associate, 
merge 
or 
consolidate 
their 
operation 
in 
order 
to 
promote 
economies 
of 
scale 
in 
their 
operations.

The 
Institutional 
set 
up 
is 
accompanied 
by 
reforms 
that 
promote 
integrated 
approaches, 
taking 
into 
account 
changes 
in 
procedures, attitudes, 
behaviour 
and 
the 
full 
participation 
of 
women 
at 
all 
levels 
There 
is 
an 
acceleration 
of 
institutional 
and 
capacity 
building 
efforts 
in 
technical,  legal, 
financial 
and 
economic 
management 
of 
UWSS 
sub-sector 
at 
all 
levels. 
e 
Staff 
up 
to 
the 
lowest 
level, 
are 
properly 
trained 
and 
deployed.

New 
entities 
of 
user 
groups 
and 
co-operatives 
will 
be 
promoted 
and 
established. 
Private 
Sector 
Participation 
(PSP) 
17. 
The  Government 
has 
embarked 
on 
the 
process 
of 
reforming 
and 
restructuring  the 
economy 
and 
the 
civil 
service. 
The 
Government 
has 
now 
endorsed 
the 
participation 
of 
private 
sector 
and 
other 
stakeholders 
in 
provision 
of 
water 
supply 
and 
sewerage services. 
Private 
sector 
participation, 
including 
options 
for 
full 
concessions, 
Lease 
operations, management 
and 
services 
contracts 
are 
recommended 
for 
the 
management 
of 
urban water 
supply 
and 
sewerage services. 
18. 
The 
process 
of 
involving 
private 
sector 
in 
the 
DAWASA’s 
operations 
is 
nearing 
completion. 
The 
lessons 
learnt 
in 
the 
last 
five 
years 
of 
the 
process 
offer 
a 
good 
experience 
and 
learning ground 
for 
PSP 
involvement 
in 
the 
other 
UWSAs. Each private 
sector 
transaction 
will 
however 
be 
appraised 
on 
its 
own 
merit 
and 
opportunity 
for 
economies 
of 
scale 
for 
joint 
management 
of 
multiple 
UWSAs 
will 
be 
acceptable. 
Promotion 
of 
Hygiene 
and 
Behaviour Change 
19. 
UWSS 
services 
are 
about 
improving 
the 
health 
and 
well 
being 
of 
users. 
Relevant 
hygiene 
promotion 
for 
positive 
behaviour transformation 
shall 
be 
factored 
in 
the operational 
practice 
of 
all 
UWSA 
operations. 
Appropriate 
linkages 
with 
Ministry 
of 
Health, 
Local 
Government, 
existing 
programs, 
and 
other 
private 
sector 
and 
media 
groups 
shall 
be 
encouraged. 
Conclusion 
20. 
The 
Government 
will 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
the 
above 
policy 
reforms. 
A 
Technical 
Advisory 
Committee 
involving 
all 
key 
UWSS 
stakeholders 
is 
already 
in 
place 
to 
guide 
the 
implementation 
and 
provide 
appropriate  forum  for 
annual 
reviews 
of 
the 
operations 
of 
all 
UWSAs 
and 
the 
implementation 
of 
these 
policies. 
In 
the 
process, 
the 
GOT 
will 
develop 
within 
the 
MWLD 
a 
credible 
Management 
Information 
System 
(MIS) 
to 
track 
developments 
in 
the 
sector 
and 
accumulate best practices 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Urban 
WSS 
Strategy 
and 
Investment Programme 
with 
the 
view 
of 
reducing 
the 
proportion 
of 
people 
without 
access 
to 
safe 
drinking 
water 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
project 
period.
