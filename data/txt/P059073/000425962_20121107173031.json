under a lease contract with the Dar es\n            Salaam Water and Sewerage Authority (DAWASA) to provide\n            water supply and sewerage services in Tanzania's\n            largest city. CWS' performance was disappointing and it\n            encountered serious financial difficulties early. Within two\n            years, the contract collapsed with the dramatic expulsion of\n            its expatriate managers from the country. Two international\n            arbitration tribunals ensued. The case raises compelling\n            questions about the preparation of the public-private\n            partnership (PPP), the selection process, the allocation of\n            risks in the contract, expectations regarding financial\n            viability and service improvements, the effectiveness of the\n            public-public partnership that has existed since the private\n            operator departed, and how to structure institutional\n            relationships to ensure accountability. It also provides an\n            opportunity to evaluate how customers, especially the poor,\n            were affected. The objective of the present study is to\n            review the evolution of the institutional framework for\n            water supply and sewerage services in Dar es Salaam from the\n            late 1990s to 2010, assess the performance of the key\n            actors, and extract lessons that might be useful to\n            Government of the United Republic of Tanzania (GOT), DAWASA,\n            the World Bank, other international lenders and sector\n            practitioners. Frequent reference is made to the Dar es\n            Salaam Water Supply and Sanitation Project (DWSSP) which\n            supported the institutional reforms and investments in the\n            services from 2003-2010."}, "docdt": "2012-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
