 TANZANIA -- DAR ES SALAAM WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT
                             P059073
                         CREDIT NO. 3771-TA

                                  Restructuring Paper

1.      In a letter from the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs (MOFEA), dated
June 24, 2010 (and an amendment dated June 28, 2010) the borrower has requested that
the closing date for Tanzania, DAR ES SALAAM WATER SUPPLY AND
SANITATION PROJECT (DWSSP), Credit No. 3771-TA, P059073 be extended from
June 30, 2010 until November 15, 2010 for a single contract in the amount of USD
2,080,434.00 with M/S Degremont (Pty) Limited of South Africa for the purchase of
Water Pumps and Spares for installation at the Upper and Lower Ruvu Treated Water
Stations (signed April 28, 2010). There will be no other changes to the project and based
on communication received from the supplier the team considers an extension of 5
months adequate. This will be the 3rd extension of the project and will bring the closing
date to November 30, 2010.

Compliance with Operational Policy (OP) 13.30

2.      The team has agreed with the borrower on a written specific action plan which is
acceptable to the Association to complete the project within the new extension period. A
copy of the borrowers request for extension and the action plan that has been agreed with
the Association are attached. The Project Development Objective continues to be
achievable if the extension is granted and action plan implemented. The performance of
the borrower and implementing agency is satisfactory. However the audit report for
fiscal year 2008/2009 was qualified. The Association and the borrower agreed in writing
on a time bound action plan to address the audit findings, which is detailed in the action
plan enclosed as Attachment 3. Neither Tanzania nor DWSSP are under suspension of
disbursements.

3.       The completion of this contract will increase the likelihood of sustainability by
allowing for the: (i) replacement of aged high lift pumps; and (ii) the procurement of
necessary spares deemed essential to the continued functioning of the Upper Ruvu and
Lower Ruvu plants. Both have been experiencing frequent breakdowns that have
disrupted service delivery to Dar es Salaam. Efforts to procure the pumps begin in June
2009, however, there have been significant delays. The borrower first requested the
Association's approval to proceed with the purchase of the pumps on July 6, 2009.
However, the first attempt to procure the pumps failed as quotations from shortlisted
suppliers were considered expensive and the proposed delivery period extended beyond
the initial project closing date of December 31, 2009. Processing of a second request for
bids was therefore suspended until an extension of the project was granted up to June 30,
2010.

                                            3
4.      Following the extension of the project in December 2009, the borrower sought
permission (March 2010) from the Association to directly contract the plant and
equipment taking into account lessons learned from the first attempt to procure the
pumps. This request was granted in April 12, 2010 and the schedule of requirements and
specifications was reviewed, negotiations carried out and the contract signed on April 28,
2010 with M/S Degremont Pty Ltd (the Supplier) with a delivery and installation period
of three months. On June 15th, the Manufacturer M/S Turbo Machinery Services (TMS)
UK communicated to the borrower (through the Supplier) that due to other commitments,
the delivery of the pumps would be further delayed. Considering the time required for
inspection and shipment it is expected that the timetable for delivery and installation of
these pumps will be delayed to October/November, 2010.

5.      The borrower has paid the first of three installments in the amount of $390,087
(20% advance payment) against a receipt of invoice. The balance to be paid is
$1,690,347 (see details in Attachment 1). There are sufficient funds remaining in the
credit to cover the remaining payments. Out of a total of $60.11 million available to the
borrower, $58.94 million has been disbursed and $2.85 million is undisbursed1 (see
Attachment 2. There will be no changes in the flow of funds or to disbursement
arrangements. The project has regularly prepared required Interim (Unaudited) Financial
Reports (IFRs) and submitted these to the Bank on time. The IFRs have been found to be
satisfactory.
