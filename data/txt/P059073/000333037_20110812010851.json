  Supply and Sanitation Project for Tanzania were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory; the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial; the Bank's\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory; and the\n            Borrower's performance was also moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: examine a\n            wider range of factors affecting success. During project\n            preparation and implementation there is a natural tendency\n            to focus on the factors that are most visible. Take the\n            concerns of a range of qualified potential bidders into\n            account. Borrowers need to be diligent in assessing the\n            market and developing strategies for attracting qualified\n            bidders. Withdraw or change course when project related\n            issues cannot be resolved satisfactorily. Perhaps the World\n            Bank should have been more willing to withdraw from\n            supporting the transaction and the project when the\n            selection process did not progress in a constructive and\n            transparent manner and afterwards, when the conditions to\n            improve performance were not created. Develop contingency\n            plans in event of termination of the private operator's\n            contract. Develop rigorous systems and processes for\n            reporting, monitoring, and collecting performance data.\n            Ensure the effectiveness of performance bonds."}, "docdt": "2011-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
