                         The development objective of the project is to provide a reliable, affordable and sustainable water supply service and improve the sewerage and sanitation in
                         the "Service Area" of the Dar es Salaam Water and Sewerage Authority (DAWASA) that includes Dar es Salaam and part of the Coast region to help improve
                         public health and well-being in a city prone to cholera outbreaks or other water-borne diseases and support productive activities of the country's main
                         economic center.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project is closing on November 30, 2011 with over 98% of project proceeds disbursed. The extension granted in June 2010, has allowed DAWASA to finalize procurement of

                         key pumping equipment that will enable more reliable water supply to the city. In addition, DAWASA has taken steps to ensure that water supply to low income communities is
                         provided more regularly (e.g. by drilling boreholes in locations with limited or no supply). In order to improve the commercial performance of DAWASCO, a review of the current lease
                         contract between DAWASA and DAWASCO is also being undertaken. The review will clarify roles and responsibilities of each agency, as well as improve performance monitoring
                         and management. The supply of water to Dar es salaam remains inadequate, and measures to expand production capacity have been incorporated in the ongoing Water Sector
                         Development Program, a SWAp being supported by most donors in the country. While most activities have been completed there is still some way to go before water constraints in
                         Dar es salaam are resolved and DAWASCOs financial performance is at a sustainable level.
